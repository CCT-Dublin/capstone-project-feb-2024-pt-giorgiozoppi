28,Should Have Been so Much Better,"Just had 7 nights in a City view Level Premium room on the 29th floor.
The Level facilities are great, snacks & drinks all day with a wider selection of tapas and premium drinks 5.30 - 7pm.
Everything about the hotel is pretty good, a little out of the way but good travel connections via tram, bus or Metro.
In a good location with plenty of local Spanish shops, bars & restaurants.
Hotel staff were great with a special mention to Eliwina and Elizabeth in the Level breakfast area.
Our Holiday was almost ruined on the first night when I had to report Morons in the next room ( 2907 ) at midnight because of the noisy room party they were having.
Again had to report them to reception on the third night for the same thing.
Although on both occasions reception and Sara from the Level reception intervened and warned the occupants next door I do feel the Hotel could and should have dealt with the issue in a better way. Although I was offered the opportunity to move rooms on both occasions I declined as I thought this was the easy option for the hotel and why should I have to move. 
Very surprised a Melia hotel of this standard would allow this sort of behaviour from guests, not once but on two occasions.
I dread to think what our holiday would have been like if our neighbours hadn’t checked out after 3 days.
Sorry there’s no photo’s but Tripadvisor wouldn’t let me upload any !",4,2024,09,07
28,A very convenient hotel,"This is a lovely hotel, the only minor problem was there was a very large stag party staying, and the lifts were very busy. and the overpowered the bar, we never ventured into the city but looks a reasonable walk, if you are going on a cruise this hotel is perfectly situated.",5,2023,07,10
28,"A get away from it all, chill vibes ciry break!","The Melia Barcelona Sky hotel is perfectly situated in the vibrant city of Barcelona, making it an ideal base for exploring the city’s rich culture and attractions. Located in the northeastern part of the city, it is just a short walk from the beach and offers easy access to major landmarks such as La Sagrada Familia and La Rambla. The public transport options nearby make getting around effortless, which allowed us  to experience all that Barcelona has to offer without any hassle. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail I was given on check in.  It was a very special birthday celebration for my Mum, and we were both made feel very at ease on check in. Although we arrived well before 3pm, and the level was quite busy due to a function, there was no shortage of snacks and finger food.  I must mention the care and attention we were given by the guest services team, ably lead by Javier who was a breath of fresh air in how he dealt with some initial queries I had on arrival. 

Jordina, Nis and Guiselle were so helpful at giving their advice on local sights, transport and activities. Although the staff were always busy, they seemed to make time for each and every customer. Your patience is truly remarkable.  The level is truly on another level. 

The accommodation at Melia Barcelona Sky is nothing short of exceptional. The rooms are spacious, modern, and well-appointed with comfortable beds and stylish decor. We were able to enjoy stunning views of the city  from our fabulous room 2606 where the view of the sagrada was exceptional.  The amenities provided, including fast Wi-Fi, a minibar, and quality toiletries, ensure that every need was catered for.  The rituals prodcuts are hard to beat, and the shower is an unbeatable rainforest shower which is lovely after a day sighseeing. The cleaning staff are to be commended for the standard of cleanliness. 

The dining options at the hotel are more than impressive. We were blown away by the extensive breakfast buffet served on the 24th floor, which features a wide selection of fresh pastries, cheeses, meats, and made-to-order egg dishes. Our massive thanks to Ivan who made us some fabulous mimosas as we overlooked the beach from floor 24! The Sky Food Bar offers a delightful menu for lunch and dinner with a variety of delicious options that cater to different tastes. Whether enjoying a casual meal or a more refined dining experience, there is somethning for everyone!

One of the standout features of Melia Barcelona Sky is its fantastic facilities. The rooftop pool provides a perfect spot for relaxation, with the nearby spa just steps away. The free spa vouchers were a lovely surprise!Additionally, there is a well-equipped fitness center for those looking to maintain their workout routine during their stay. The Level lounge on higher floors offers exclusive access to premium services and amenities that elevate the guest experience even further.  This cannot be missed!

The staff at Melia Barcelona Sky are to be commended for their friendliness and professionalism. Everyone we met always seemed happy to be working there.  Their smiles were infectious! 
From check-in to check-out, we felt welcomed and valued by attentive team members who go above and beyond to ensure a pleasant stay. Their knowledge about local attractions and willingness to assist with any requests truly enhances the overall experience. I must mention Estefania who works so hard downstairs and then comes to floor 24 for happy hour, and just brings so much positivity to a room, she was a pleasure to meet. On floor 25 the level, it was a lovely quiet space to relax, read, have a chat, or catch up on work- I managed to do all 4 during my short trip. Antonino brought the fun factor on floor 25- he was always so welcoming and passionate about his job any time we visited floor 25. He puts everyone in a good mood! Thank you to Antonino for the advice on shows to see wth my Mum for her birthday!
I must mention Frederico who attended to all our needs during lunch and evening tapas; Lautaro for being so approachable during our stay. Adrian and Pablo went out of their way to help us to the lifts and our rooms to and from check in/check out, for this we are grateful.
Our final thanks to Victor, Esteve, Johanna, Deborah at main reception for taking our questions, helping us with queries, whilst always wearing a smile! 

We will bnever forget our special stay at the level at the melia barcelona sky, our slice of heaven, a haven of happiness where nothing is a problem!  We met some friends for life at the level.  We will be back. Thank you for the memories, the laughs, the chats and for this unforgettable time away with my Mum.",5,2024,08,27
28,Una Gemma in città,"We stayed a week in early August in a very spacious and comfortable suite on the 28th floor of the Red Level. 
The hotel is located in a strategic area: quiet in the evening with the possibility of walking along the Diagonal, close to the sea, with shops and shopping centers 5 minutes walk.
The pool area is on the sixth floor and quite adequate for a city hotel with umbrellas and very comfortable chairs.
The Red Level Lounge is well worth a visit, one of the best Melia lounges I have ever visited: spacious and bright, and stocked all day with delicious snacks and alcoholic drinks. The staff very attentive and helpful: a special mention to Antonino that made our stay special and was able to anticipate all our wishes. 
Highly recommended, we will definitely return.",5,2024,08,22
28,Thank you to Julia and Federico for making our stay amazing,"It was our second time at the hotel. Great location. Easy to get to most places either on foot or by metro. Lots of restaurants on Las Ramblas and in the area. Lovely room on the 18th floor. Great beds and pillows and it was so quiet I slept so welll. The level is great with lots of lovely tapas, beer and cava and soft drinks from lunch time until 10. We had breakfast there most days too. I would like to especially mention Julia who checked us in with a lovely glass of cava. She really went above and beyond helping us and recommended a fantastic tapas bar, I think it was Kalamata that had huge portions of great tapas ( I wouldn't order more than 4, you will not need them unless you are really hungry - even the waitress warned me the 6 we ordered were too many for 2 people but they were all fabulous. I also highly recommend the tortilla at the level which is the best I have had. Fedrico the chef was so lovely. He gave us a book his mum had written when we left and he illustrated which is a lovely memento of our trip. It really is a fabulous hotel and we hope to be back soon.",5,2024,03,27
28,Super level lounge bar!,"Fiendly welcome! Lounge on the 25 th floor with free drinks and food.
Breakfast has everything included the view. Our room on the 22th floor had an amazing view. Maybe the location of the hotel was a little bit less, but the hospitality makes everything good.
THX!",5,2024,03,05
28,Great Hotel and personal at the Level.,"We had the best weekend ever at the Level, al was Great all personal were nice, special shout out to Joan. thanks for being there for us! We would definetly go back once again if we need a hotel in Barcelona. Easy to travel with Tram or Metro, bus also nice to walk in not so Busy area. Beach is a nice walk in a straight way from Hotel.",5,2024,03,05
28,Nice 5 Day Stay,"We stayed January 7-12, 2024. I had a Junior Suite at the Level, my friend had a regular room on the 11th floor. The Level is a great experience & worth the extra, mainly due to the lounge. Antonio was great with tours & just any inquires and making dinner reservations. 

Breakfast was fantastic.  I said to my friend, ""this is like being on a cruise ship.""  Hopefully, this explains to you the breakfast experience. Cook to order eggs, including egg benedict, scrambled eggs, meats, pastries, fresh juices, breads, and fruit. 

The room was clean, there were some scrapes and gaps in places along the flooring or wall. Nothing concerning. The shower was a double rain shower with a double hand held spray nozzle. The provided soaps, shampoo, and conditioner were good.  The bath towels are huge and the Junior Suite came with bath robes. 

The room is cleaned each day and two cans of water are provided in the room rate. Anything in the min-fridge or the snacks are extra. There is safe in the room.

The one aggravating factor for me was, both bathroom sinks were slow to drain.  I was not able to have this repaired during my stay even though I worked through Antonio to get this done. 

The hotel restaurant has adequate offerings, the bartenders Pablo and Andrea are simply some of the best. Their drinks were great and they were happy to try to make new drinks.  Very fun experience with them, especially Pablo. 

The Level in on floor 25 and this is for check-in and check-out. Plus, the Level lounge is located here too. Cava, Wine, and beer are offered during the hours of operation. However, from 5:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. pour your own liquor is offered. Food offerings are sandwiches, meats, cheeses, pastries, soda's, nuts, etc. 

Would I stay here again. Yes and without hesitation. Would I pay to stay at the Level?  I'm not sure this was worth the surcharge of several hundred USD over 5 days.",4,2024,01,14
28,"Amazing, superb, incredible, loved every minute ","What an amazing 6 nights !  Hotel amazing, room was fantastic, we had a junior suite. Wow two showers, two sinks and a both ! In fact if you count the shower in the bath and the rain showers there was a total of 5! 
We would recommend the level, the experience was out of this world, great drinks plus a cocktail hour and half, lovely snacks provided every day all day. Loved the ham quiche, was divine. 
Emma who checked us in was incredibly attentive and made sure we had the best stay ever, she was always quick to help us with anything we needed. Thank you Emma. 
We will definitely be back and can’t wait to organise the next trip to this amazing hotel. Dan and Des",5,2024,01,05
28,Great hotel - pretty loud though,"Brilliant hotel, lovely & friendly staff. Hotel is a little outside the city, but we don’t mind a walk & there is public transport near by easy enough to use. We had a very nice room in the level grand premium city view - however there was a toddler next door who we could hear laugh and cry the full time. There was also a room on our floor (floor has around six rooms and this one was on the opposite end to us) which was blaring music around 11/12pm and we heard these guests return back to their room around 3am and back to playing music. Appreciate not the toddlers or party goers fault but could be avoided at a five star hotel with sound proofing in the rooms. ",4,2024,01,03
28,Incredible Experience in Barcelona,"Will and Anya. We came here for our anniversary and was the best hotel we could have asked for, the hotel is lovely and the customer experience was above the 5 star, they would assist with any queries and were available all of the time, gave us a room upgrade and took care of us throughout the whole trip. Emma and Paola were excellent and would resolve any issues we had and always go that extra bit to help us for any inconveniences we had. Rooms were always cleaned every day to a high standard and views from the room was unmatched, and food there was really nice. Location was ideal as it was close to the beach and there was a metro station a 5 minute walk away where you could get anywhere quickly. Completely deserves the five star, very satisfied by this stay and would recommend to anyone traveling in Barcelona.",5,2023,10,29
28,Honeymoon ,"I can not even describe how helpful was MARC from reception and JOAN. 

Thank you guys for your help with everything from A until Z . 

I would like to mention housekeeping which was very poor standard from my point of view as an assistant and f accommodation manager. 
I had the best room on the upper floor executive junior lounge , even after I left money for housekeeping they did nothing , amenities was not replenished and money was taken ,it’s a shame . Supervisors should be more vigilant and more focused on their job . 
I met a supervisor on the corridor and she didn’t even ask if all is good . 

One more time a HUGE TNANK YOU TO MARC AND JOAN! 

Thanks guys! 

Helena and Martin , we will be back soon .

28,Top Quality as you would expect,Stunning hotel. Great location for the auditorium we had tickets for. Staff were highly hospitable and nothing was too much trouble. We love the Melia brand and this did not disappoint. Stunning views from Level 24. Lovely modern and spacious room. Could not fault any part of the stay.,5,2023,09,03
28,"Tired hotel, in need of a refresh. Good staff. Poor gluten free attempts.","I was booked into the Level for a work trip to visit a company whose office was conveniently opposite the buildings entrance.

The hotel was a reasonable 10-15min drive from the airport.

On arrival, we were asked if we were checking in and shown to the lifts where we were sent up to the 25th floor. The lifts have seen better days and are looking rather well used which is rather an indication of things to come.

The welcome at reception was superb and we were offered water, fruit juice or cava. We accepted the cava and had a short wait for a member of staff to become free to serve us. When they did, they took our passports and directed us to the lounge to help ourselves to food and drink while they checked us in.

The lounge is a real highlight. They offer free coke, Fanta, beer, wine and an array of snacks including fresh fruit, sandwiches, crisps, nuts and more. The only negative for me with a gluten allergy ( coeliac )  is that it wasn’t always clear what I could and could not have. There was a gluten free corner but often items were placed nearby - like bread! Which clearly was not gluten free and nuts, crisps & olives where it was not clear if they were or not. This could & should be improved or the gluten free corner removed to prevent mishaps.

As we were enjoying our drinks and snacks the member of staff checking us in came over with our passports and room keys and informed us of a city tax to pay which we then done, we then finished our items and headed to our rooms, in my case this meant going down to the 16th floor.

I was put in room 1614 and the first thing that hit me when entering, was the smell of damp. It was really rather over powering so much so that when I returned home and smelt my clothes, some of which I hadn’t worn, they smelt of the mouldy/damp smell that the room had. In all honesty, had I not been there for work I would have immediately asked to change rooms, as I was there for only two nights and wouldn’t be in the room much, I decided I didn’t want the hassle, but I have asthma so this environment was really not ideal and needs rectifying asap.

The room itself was okay. I was expecting better though for the class of hotel. There is for example nowhere to sit and do makeup. It wasn’t clear what items were complimentary in the room and what was not. The double bed was two singles pushed together. On entering the room the curtains were drawn which isn’t a nice welcome and for 2023 I was shocked to find that there were no USB plugs for charging items - I even have USB plugs in my home, they’re not a great expense and I’d brought no adapters - thankfully they had one in reception that I could borrow or I would have been in trouble! The shower/bath area was okay, but there was black mould around the bath and shower and the head of the shower was not very clean. The toilet is also very low which could be difficult for more elderly guests. Additionally, there is a dental kit provided (made of wheat so I didn’t use it - weird choice ), shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hairdryer and towels ( which I found rather rough but a good size ).

When sleeping, you can hear guests in the halls. There was a gap below the main door of the room where light & sound would come in under. In addition, when my room was cleaned after the first night, the blackout curtain was left open but the other curtain closed and I hadn’t realised as I had returned late and so the light coming in woke me in the morning. They’d also removed my second room key from the electric switch and it took me a while to find it so that I could put on the air con, which was easy to use and cooled the room very well.

The tv offered good options including an alarm which I used and many channels in many different languages which kept me entertained in the evening. You’re also able to stream from your phone which i also always find useful when travelling for work to keep me entertained. Other items in the room: Safe, tea and coffee making facilities, wardrobe/chest of draws, a sofa, seat and desk.

At breakfast, there was some confusion as I wasn’t on the clipboard but when they looked on their system I was welcomed in. I had breakfast in “Sky” which I believe was on the 24th floor. I informed them I had a gluten allergy and I was shown to a very small gluten free corner which feels like it is there as a token gesture rather than a valid attempt. They then asked the chef what I could have and he just shook his head and I was told no. I was then left on my own to try to figure out what I could have. On day 1 I ate some little sponge type things from the gluten free corner which were actually very very nice, some fresh fruit. I also tried a gluten free pastry item in a bag but it was so hard I couldn’t actually bite into it. On day two, the nice sponge things sadly were not there, neither were the pastry things but this time some baguette shaped bread. I was going to have one but the one I picked up was mouldy, so I handed that to the chef, who made little attempt to apologise for it being put out in the first place and then I went for some salami and cheeses and then decided to be brave and have some bacon and some eggs and was fine - though there is a high chance of cross contamination I would suspect from the preparation. 

Back to the room and when showering the water pressure was extremely weak, my shower at home is much better - which shouldn’t be the case when staying at a hotel. 

Other points to note : the gym is not overly well equipped and equipment although they have adapters for iPhones are very old versions. I did not try the spa but was given a free voucher on check in for access that I did not use and neither did I have time to try the pools or the restaurants at any time other than at breakfast. 

On checkout, it was smooth and the staff were great. I have to say, on the whole the staff in the hotel were superb. However, based on breakfast & the lack of gluten free options, and age of the rooms and the condition of the room I had (damp). I would not return or recommend.",2,2023,07,30
28,Barcelona at short notice,"We arrived after a delayed late flight and were immediately put at ease with extraordinary customer service. Our room had a great city view and was very nicely decorated. This was a last minute addition to our honeymoon, and the 4 nights were perfect. Everyone was helpful and pointed us to sites and walking routes suited to our style of holiday. Special thanks to Manu and Pere!! ",5,2023,07,27
28,Dirty suite after 4 requests for proper cleaning.,"Lovely personnel, nice lounge and happy hour and breakfast in the 24rh floor.

Absolutely miserable maintenance/cleaning of both the public places and the
suite: a ball of light hair on the floor in a ”cleaned” suite, when arriving, and the same piece of trash 4 days in the same spot after 4 requests of proper cleaning. Feet get black by walking on the suite floor…

The part of town in nothing to mention home about, so the when the hotel fails to provide basic hygienics, I recommed to avoid the facility.",2,2023,07,23
28,Great hotel and great location.,"Amazing hotel, great location. About 10 min from hop on hop off bus. The pool is beautiful and the staff very kind. Highly recommended the level for snack, evening drinks and more. We loved our experience. The room are clean and spacious for Barcelona.",5,2023,07,14
28,Hen party break,"I would like to thank the following staff who made our stay even better with their brilliant service:-
Lucia
Sofia
Giulia
Emma
Antonino
Hotel is amazing and cannot fault it at all. Highly recommend. 
 ",5,2023,06,23
28,Great hotel for a city break,"We have just returned from a lovely stay at The Level Melia Sky. Emma checked us in the special check in on level 25 and was an absolute star. Friendly in manner and attentive in our questions. She was also very kind in offering welcome drinks and booking tickets on the open top bus. 

 We had a family room city view which was two interconnecting rooms. One had a very comfortable double bed with bathroom and the other a twin with its own bathroom. Both were nice in decor and clean. The view out on the city was great. We  made use of the level lounge at different points in the day when we headed back to the hotel. It was great as they had small sandwiches, cakes, snacks and wine (including cava)  and beers all day.  We also took advantage of the drinks and canapés between 6-7.30pm where there are also spirits. The views were amazing and again service good. We did not pay the 22 euro per person for breakfast on level 24 as we felt this was quite pricey and instead popped to one of the many local cafes en route to our destinations each day. We used the pool area always managing somewhere to sit and even though the pool was chilly the kids ventured in once. The pool area whilst small was very cool.

Pere IV tram stop is a couple mins walk which we used to get down to the Olympic village area Poble Nou metro is about an 8min walk through a more traditional part of town. The beach was 20mins and lots of restaurants on the sea. There are stacks of local bars and restaurants and if you want chains there is a Westfield shopping centre within 10min walk. 

I would highly recommend this hotel as we had a great stay, many thanks to all at Melia for making this a great city break.",5,2023,06,02
28,A wonderful hotel for a stay in Barcelona.,"Having stayed several times in the past at The Level Melîa Sevilla, we decided to try The Level Melîa Barcelona Sky for our trip to Barcelona, and it was an excellent choice.

Located in a stylish 31 storey building in the Poblenou district of Barcelona, the hotel is ideally situated between the city centre and the magnificent Barcelona beach. The nearby Rambla de Poblenou had a real village feel to it, and has a good selection of bars and restaurants

Reception for The Level is on the 25th floor, and the check-in experience was faultless. We arrived at around 12.00 and our room was ready shortly after our arrival, and was located on the 23rd floor with wonderful views across the city to the sea. The room was comfortable and well equipped, albeit that the styling was a little minimalist and not to our personal taste, although I am sure many would love the style.

What makes this hotel particularly good are the wonderful staff, who without exception make you feel valued as guests. The Level lounge on the 25th floor was excellent, with a selection of snacks and drinks, including wines and beer, available throughout the day. The staff here were really excellent and helpful.

Between 18.00 to 19.30 each day there was a buffet of appetisers and self serve drinks on the level 24 Skyline lounge, which was an excellent way to start the evening with beautiful views over the city. A special mention to Ezequiel for his friendly and efficient attentiveness in the Skyline24.

Breakfast, also served in the Skyline24 was very good.

The check-out experience was also excellent and we were able to get a complimentary late check-out  

This is a very well-run hotel with excellent staff who do everything they can to make guests have a wonderful stay. 

",5,2023,05,01
28,Very enjoyable stay,"Brilliant hotel, all the staff are excellent with particular mention to Emma on The Level reception who was very friendly and informative. Views from upper floors are superb. Lots of good value restaurants nearby. Location is away from main tourist areas but very near metro and tram stops, also taxi rank outside hotel. I’d definitely stay again.",5,2023,04,26
28,Allergy friendly and impeccable service!,"I stayed here with my husband and 2yo - for a couple nights before catching a cruise. It was a great location away from the main hustle and bustle - but still had plenty of shops and restaurants to peruse. 

The room was comfortable and service excellent. My 2yo received lots of attention and was made to feel very comfortable.

The major reason for leaving a review is how blown away I was by the staff and the restaurant for being so excellently equipped to cater to my little boy’s allergies. I have major anxiety going on holiday when I have a lo with multiple allergies (wheat AND dairy to name a few) allergy parents will know - it is incredibly tricky finding food out - not to mention in a foreign country. But Melia was amazing!!! Every allergen was labelled on every food. There was a whole separate section of gluten free foods at breakfast (that were mostly dairy free too!) and all of the staff were extremely helpful in guiding us on what was “safe” from the main buffet.

Allergy parents and sufferers - stay here! 

Thank you Melia!",5,2023,04,24
28,Excellent ,I really enjoyed my stay at the Level at Melia Barcelona Sky  - the hotel is located in a very quiet safe area away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre yet only 10 minutes walk from the beach -  the view from my room of the sea and the city was amazing - breakfast  on the 24th floor was excellent - the reception staff were really friendly and helpful- Pablo was so cheerful and eager to be of assistance as was Lucia - I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to return again,5,2023,04,22
28,"Nice location high above Barcelona, with friendly service but room maintenance could be better","We stayed at the Level at Melia Barcelona Sky in March 2023. The location is ok not quite in the center but with the metro no problem. The Level rooms are located on the upper floor of the hotel with a nice lounge on the 25th floor. Service there is really friendly and the staff is absolutely amazing. Also nice drinks and snacks all over the day. Just the coffee machine could be a better one or if it needs to be with capsules it should be a Nespresso!

Also breakfast is served on the 24th floor as well as a nice Cocktail hour in the evening with also some snacks and drinks. But I was missing at least, one hot snack and maybe a cocktail. Breakfast had a good selection and also live cooking was available. But also at the breakfast area just one nice coffee machine (WMF) all other just with capsules and also not Nespresso ones. 

The only negative aspect of our stay was the room. First to start with the positive things. The views are nice and the room has a perfect size. But the maintenance could be improved. Many issues with the carpet and also in the bathroom some areas were not in best shape.

Further I did not like the design of the hotel corridors. Like not looking friendly at all",4,2023,04,12
28,Great Hotel and perfect stay,"The level in the Melia hotel is great. It started with a rocky start but it was fixed and changed my opinion in couple of hours. The check in was annoying as we were told to wait, and then left us for a hour in the lounge. The new lady that served us, amazing, so kind and helpful. got to the room, and we had to change it because of a broken door. but they changed our room within moments. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel to anyone. I really would. the rooms are so nice, the service was 85% AMAZING, (that 15% IS from the start of the stay). being a gold member, I feel I didn't get the full benefits but its still very good overall. The manager, Poala. Franco Garcia, she knows what customer service, customer relations and how to talk to customers, she is a remarkable person to talk to. This is my usual hotel now, I wouldn't go anywhere else. You have to stay here without fail. you can get a metro for £10 for 10 trips and gets you to the places you want to go around Barcelona. It's located not in a busy area so that makes it great for me, and there a great Japanese buffet close by. This hotel has everything you need for a beautiful stay. the lounge, the views, the service. ",4,2023,03,28
28,Great staff and beautiful views,"First time in a Melia property opted for the The Level at Barcelona Sky. With Melia being a Spanish brand, I had some hopes it would be a good hotel option to go for. Immediately I noticed a key strength of their brand is the quality of the staff they have attracted as I was seen to very warmly by one of the staff, Marc, in the downstairs lobby area and ushered up to the 25th floor lobby level. As our first and last point of contact in the hotel building, Marc left us with a very good impression of Melia. I found the lifts fast, smooth and clean. The Level lobby/reception is adjacent to the level 25 lounge area where there is a coffee machine, drinks, light snacks (pastries / fruit etc) and great views. There we were warmly received by Paullo and Sara offered a drink as we completed the check in process, the room was not ready but we were early and they had no issue with us leaving some luggage and we were offered a nearby accessible toilet should we wish to change. 

By the time we came back to the hotel it was around 7pm and Emma was on the 25th lobby desk and very quickly gave us our room cards and informed us that later the 25th lobby reception closes - but of course the ground floor reception area is still available  that serves the larger hotel. We had requested a quiet room away from any major noise, and indeed we were placed in a room located in a corner of the hotel facilitating this request. The room was a decent size, with good size wardrobes and the bed was comfortable, housekeeping had clearly done a decent job cleaning as best they could as the floor in the room we were allocated was hard but clean. If I was being very fussy there were a few wear and tear issues in the room mainly related to the bathroom area - but nothing major. 

Between 18:00 and 19:30 they serve a buffet of appetisers and self serve drinks on level 24, this is a nice touch as you can enjoy the sunset over the city. We would very much like to thank Ezequiel for his excellent hospitality on level 24, he was very attentive and professional. 

There is a spa on level 5 its small but I found it clean, and the steam room particularly effective, you have to book ahead so do this early if you can, I think they do their best to control the numbers so it is not crazy busy for those using the services at a given moment. 

Checkout was at 12pm which worked well for us, we would also like to thank Lucia & Antonio who helped make our stay a pleasant experience.",5,2023,03,05
28,Wonderful stay,"initially we were welcomed into the Level at Melia by an incredibly friendly front service desk who’ helped us with an easy check in a tips for travelling within Barcelona.  The rooms were spacious and  clean with elegant finishes. The gem of this hotel however was the views of the city. The breakfast was wonderful with a variety of options to cater to everyone’s palette. Whilst it is a little out of the main historical sites, taxis and the metro is conveniently   situated. 
Overall the hotel is wonderful and I would happy recommend!",5,2023,01,17
28,Great stay with an unobscured view from the Level lounge,"We stayed there for five nights and enjoyed the level club on the 25th floor. Great location in the Poblenou area, easily walkable to a beach. Well-designed room with an unobscured view. Breakfast was superb. 
The gym was small but ok. The staff was attentive. Definitely will come again.",5,2023,01,09
28,"A good hotel from a great brand, but not one that I would return to","I’ve stayed with Meliá Hotels a lot. The White House in London was a real saviour during  the inter lockdown periods, still maintaining great service levels when other hotels where closing things down. Friendly staff too.

So, for a weekend visit to Barcelona to catch up with a friend, I choose to stay at the media sky and treat myself to one of the premium rooms on “The Level“. I could’ve booked it through the Melia website having a lot of points, but funnily enough, the price is much cheaper to get it through Booking.com, which is what I do, and I send a message that I would like the room to have one large double bed and not two single beds.

Checking in the special reception on the 25th floor of a customer staying on the level, I am dealt with by the brilliant Sophia .

The first room I’m shown has twin beds. It’s quite a small room and I’m told that a bigger room will be an extra €50 a night.,the second room is not my bigger with an oddly placed coffee table that makes the room seem actually smaller.

A quick search on Booking. Com reveals a junior suite for the same price and on asking for this I’m given it by Sophia so an extra 150€ for three nights 

On getting into the suite I find lights that don’t work and a toilet full of sh*t- quite literally.

Over the next three hours things are slowly sorted, but it’s an interruption to my evening.

The next morning a very nice manager called Jacopo came to the room with a very sincere apology for what it happened, and said that the hotel will do its best to make good, which I have to say it’s certainly doing over the rest of the weekend.

But looking at the hotel in overall, I can’t really recommend it to somewhere I’d stay again in Barcelona. It’s a good 15 minutes out of the centre and it’s not in an area that seems to have any particular factor to recommended. The restaurants in the hotel obviously keep to Spanish hours as at 12:30 pm on a Sunday lunch one can’t get any lunch and at 6:30 pm on a Sunday evening one can’t get any dinner other than the room service menu which consists of four burgers, a club sandwich and a vegetarian pizza.

The breakfast room is fantastic if you’re staying on the level. It’s on the 24th floor with a view of the sea, but after breakfast, the room is closed for the rest of the day. There is a lounge on the 25th floor for people using the level which has small windows and the city view, but he is well staffed and is a pleasant place to retreat to. The room on the 24th, would be much more spectacular and welcoming. the thing that makes this hotel is the staff who are welcoming pleasant and work very hard, but in terms of location and value for money, it’s not one that I could. I can recommend or return to.",3,2022,11,13
28,Newsletter impossible to subscribe,"It is impossible to unsubscribe the Melia newsletter. Had I known this before, I never would had booked a stay in this hotel. Now I keep receiving their advertisement every week or two. Super annoying.",1,2022,11,11
28,"4, not 5 star hotel, awesome lounge","This is a 4 star hotel in my opinion.
Room
- The room was on floor 22, which offered nice views to the sea. I saw multiple comments that the sea view is worth the money, however I might not agree. The sun does wake you up which is nice on this side of the building, but the sea is not any more soectacular than the mountains on the other side for cheaper price. The room was very clean. What was weird, was that only 2 cans of water was complimentary per stay, not per day. I guess this is one of the examples, why I would consider this a 4 star hotel. There were some mold or covered water leaks above the shower too. Otherwise room was great, modern, a fantastic tv, large and great bed and pillows. 

Service
- The service was always great! Everyone was very happy and even asked how I had liked the stay so far. They respected my request for a lounge access based on my status too. Room cleaner did a great job especially after a solid tip. 

Hotel area
- The windows were unfortunately dirty, which made it impossible to take pictures from the high floors. The breakfast buffet area is very small and fits only around 10 people at a time. This is a mess and very unfortunate. There are lots of tables to sit, but the buffet gets way too crowded. The selection was solid, had everything one can expect, but not anything over the top either. Perhaps they should consider serving the breakfast on the first floor in that restaurant to have more room for people.
- The pool area was empty of people everyday, not surprising as it was november. However, the pool area is super nice!! Great chairs and sofas, great pool! 

Location
- A bit far away from everything, but this is the reason for a cheaper room rate. It takes around 40minutes to walk to the beach clubs and port Olympic. Closer to 1 hour to La Rambla. Thus, taxi will be used a lot, budget that in.

Price
- Great price-quality ratio. Cheapest 5 star hotel in town, which unfortunately can be felt in the level of everything. In my opinion more like a 4 star hotel, not comparable with Ritz Carltons etc at all. 

Finally the lounge!!!
- It is worth every penny! If you have a gold status or higher, request access to the lounge! They have full buffer available from 10-22 every day, with drinks, alcohol, and a good selection of cold dishes. This saved you atleast 1 meal per day. It is also very wuiet, perfect for working too, while having a drink and snacks. The lounge is comparable to any other 5 star l",4,2022,11,08
28,Fan hotel,"Loved The Level at Melia Sky! Fab staff, great food. Lovely junior suite. Would definitely book again. Lovely views from 24th & 25th floor. Great bathroom, double sink, double shower. Great size deep bath. Dressing area & plenty of wardrobe space.",5,2022,10,09
28,Ruslan,"Everything was perfect, the room spacious and good decorated, the breakfast with stunning view, the level lounge and lepool with perfect musics set , and big plus welcoming snacks .
We’ll come back for sure!
Receptionist Maria very kind and professional!",5,2022,09,11
28,Affordable and Comfortable Retreat in Barcelona,"Whenever we visit Barcelona, we prefer to stay at the level Melia Barcelona the sky. This is the perfect hotel for a city break, away from the hustle and bustle of the city center, yet close enough by a taxi ride; cost to Plaza Catalunya around eur10-12. All taxis nowadays are accepting credit cards. 

Front desk staff were extremely efficient, pleasant and helpful. Property was clean. Every staff member we encountered, from the check-in to the breakfast venue to the executive lounge were all eager to help. Special thanks to the breakfast manger Lady and her colleagues for their friendly efficient hospitality. Staff were delightful and eager to help though some of them require language knowledge of English. 

However, there were few shortcomings, namely;  
1 . There was no nightly turn down service in the suite.
2. Bottled water could be better provided  instead of the two cans of water. 
3. The opening hours of the executive lounge could be extended till 10pm and quality of snacks needs to be improved and please widen the selection of varieties of snacks. 
4. We noticed also the swimming pool is relatively small and overcrowded with children.
5. The restaurant menu had limited dishes to offer, I think more options are needed.  

However, all in all, my family and I enjoyed our stay at the Level Melia Sky and thanks to all of the staff for their friendly hospitality. We absolutely recommend this hotel.",4,2022,08,07
28,Modern and chic hotel with amazing views!,"The Melia Sky is one, if not the go-to hotel for me when visiting Barcelona. It is modern, chic, with awesome views of the city and the sea.

Breakfast is amazing with loads of choices, and you can request the chefs to make something according to your taste and preferences. When staying at the LEVEL, the views at the breakfast bar are above and beyond!

For the most part, 95% of the staff are wonderful, and they go above and beyond to make you have a pleasant stay. However, a few here and there need some retraining or to be fired.

I do worry about the soundproofing in the standard rooms, I was able to clearly hear what was going on in the rooms next door, but when I've stayed in the suites, it wasn't an issue. 

I highly recommend it!",5,2022,07,10
28,Level experience very good,"Definitely worth the extra for level. You have a choice of two drinks venues. The upper level serves food and drink all day including alcohol. The skyline does a great breakfast with lots of choice. Then in evening alcohol and snacks. Only thing I would say one of the waiters in skyline was extremely scruffy, walking round with his hands in pockets or on his phone. All other staff were very good.",5,2022,05,29
28,Would not stay here again,"Best part of our stay was excellent choice breakfast. Hotel not at all convenient for getting to centre, in a fairly nondescript residential area, beach area half hour walk. Cannot imagine why anyone would choose to stay here. Whole hotel architect designed.I.e. form before function.",2,2022,04,13
28,Don’t stay here! Not COVID safe,Terrible stay!! Don’t come.. front desk staff is really nice but management is completely incompetent and won’t resolve anything. The pool is under maintenance which they never mention anywhere.. not even checking in!! The AC turns off if you don’t move so be prepared to be hot at night ans they dont clean AC filters so COVID measures are not taken cared of. I am actually scared of the hygene measures of this hotel.. managers will always be too busy to attend to you… i saw probably 15 more people complaining about different issues so I think the hotel is beautiful on paper but very poorly managed.. it completely ruined my trip,1,2022,04,07
28,Terrible!!!,"Terrible!!! if you don't want to spoil your vacation, choose another hotel. There is absolutely no competent staff at the reception. When checking in, they said that there were no adjacent rooms, when they made a scandal, rooms appeared, and to choose from, on different floors. Yes, there is parking, convenient. The rooms are dirty, I attach a photo, there is no cleaning as such. The room is small, cold, the air conditioner does not work for heat and cracks....in the shower, the water barely flows and the shower was broken. The battery does not work, they asked to turn it on, but they did not turn it on... The toilet and shower are open, if it is inconvenient with children, and generally inconvenient, the wardrobe is small, if for a week and together, there is nowhere to hang clothes!!!We checked in late, at 23 pm, there was nowhere to eat, attention, they won't feed you at night in the hotel, they brought a terrible salad and a sandwich that the girl from the reception made!!!The breakfasts are good, but there are many good breakfasts. We will be in Barcelona again, I will choose another hotel!!!",1,2022,04,04
28,NOTBAD,This is not a 5 star we are there friends staying this hotel for three nights. Location is good but room are not good size and bathroom have a clair glass blind are not working......room cleaning  team are very good. However barcelona city is very nice...,4,2022,03,18
28,Weekend Break,"Had an amazing weekend for complete relaxation and to celebrate a birthday.  The room was just perfect with the view of the city, as requested. The Level Sky bar and lounge a tranquil area with amazing high rise views. The spa most of the time we had to ourselves and with nice treatments after.  
The team were all professional and very polite. The guest manager Paula Franco dealt with any issues we had promptly and made our holiday very pleasant. Let's say she is an invaluable asset to Melia Group.  I definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Great location. Will be back again. Thank you once again Paula for making it special for us especially on Rubéns birthday.  Rubén/Anya",5,2022,03,12
28,Great Hotel and Service with a Disappointing Room!,"The Level Lounge was a great place to relax and snack. The service was really good and everyone was super attentive. The breakfast buffet was amazing as well, especially with the view from the 24th floor.

The room was pretty average for the price. It was a really basic room, super small. Had 2 doors that led to nowhere with weird transparent stains on the wall. There was no blinds or tint on the bathroom glass which was extremely weird

P.S:  There were 2-3 mosquitoes in our room....",3,2022,02,12
28,Barcelona visit,"We stayed four nights at Barcelona Sky Level. Wonderful experience and special mention to Paola in the front desk Francisca(Panchita) at the breakfast grill and Evelina also at breakfast.  These 3 individuals went above and beyond in customer service. You have 3 gems there. Take care of them, they enhance your hotel.",5,2021,10,10
28,Great Barcelona Hotel,"I spent 4 nights at The Level Melia Barcelona Sky. Very clean, amazingly helpful staff and nice facilities. Located in quiet part of central Barcelona, within walking distance to the beach and a nice public plaza in Rambla del Poblenou. During our stay we used the spa facilities - these were fantastic, nothing but good things to say.",5,2021,09,23
28,Lots of room for improvement,"Just returned from a 3 night stay in room 2308.

Reasons to stay in this hotel
- Check in was quick and efficient, and I enjoyed Paula's efforts to upsell us to a bigger room or to add breakfast. 
- The Level staff were good and gave a great dinner recommendation
- The beers and wine on offer in the exec Lounge were very welcome. As was the Olive cake and other snacks.
- If you have kids, they are allowed to roam free in the lovely pool. Be prepared to get splashed by children constantly bombing into the pool.

Areas for improvement
- Communication between housekeeping and reception needs improving. Had an item ready for laundry service on Friday. Even by Sunday night it hadn't been returned to me and I had to remind the hotel. The excuse given was that that housekeeping didn't want to return the laundry whilst we had the 'do not disturb' sign on. Given we only had the DND sign until say 10.30am in the mornings, this excuse doesn't really wash.

- Bath robes were taken after day 1, but not replaced until we requested.

- Despite booking the spa at 4 days notice, as per the request of the hotel, when we arrived for our allotted booking time, the sauna and steam room had not been switched on that morning. There was also no staff bar a cleaner to check us in, so we had to go back down to the reception in our robes.

- Food at taps time was bland and not fresh. Well if it was fresh, the ingredients were of poor quality. Further, there was no options available, merely a prescribed plate of small bites. These sentiments were echoed by the other guests we got talking to. 

- Temperature in room was 23 degrees when returning from days out. Maintenance did fix this after we pointed this out to the front desk.

- The temperature in the shower would change significantly whilst you were showering.

- When asking front desk staff for recommendations of a place to eat, or listen to some music on Sunday evening, we were told they didn't know what to recommend because they didn't live here.

- The blankets weren't wrapped in a duvet cover. We were told this was due to COVID protocols, so they would have to be covered either side in a cover, but it wasn't closed like an envelope as such.

 
Some minor details that had no effect on my review score:

No pen in room
No paper pad in room 
2 mosquitos in room when we checked in

We gave some feedback when checking out and the lady did listen and offer her apologies. It's a shame because it was our first stay at The Melia and we have another 15 days in Spain next once so was hoping this brand would leave enough of a mark on us to want to return.",3,2021,08,30
28,Never again,"I am coming to Barcelona 2-3 times per year - since 20 years. So I think I have a solid knowledge of this amazing city. I was aware that Poblenou isn‘t a funky area. However, it is actually worse. The Level is pretending a lot, but not keeping!

Staff all over the place very nice 
Pool deck okish, but many small children
Breakfast buffet great - again many children
Executive Lounge great - did I say children? 

Rooms completely off for couples. No doors to shower/bathroom - Window between sink and bedroom, really ? 
For dinner in August, you need to go to the not so cool lobby bar - the skybar was empty at 21:30h 
The alibi gym is half empty and not useable
No reason to come back !",3,2021,08,24
28,Real downgrade,"This was our 6th time stay at the level at Melia Barcelona Sky and this would be the last time. Since last stay, everything was downgraded. Poor service at front desk( there's no more Level front desk ) to check in and ask to pay at check in with wrong price. It took long time. What's the point of ""Online check in "" if we need to do all paperwork on spot?
In the room there's nothing. ( I understand due to covid 19 things are removed but covid 19 doesn't excuse all  ) I used to get some attention upon arrival in room ( like complimentary water, little welcome letter etc) There were not even a pair of slippers. This was really disapointement for a 5 star hotel. Level lounge was self-service cafeteria with no employee around.
Overall, this hotel became simple business hotel with no attention to regular customer.
The only positive and 5 star on our stay was the breakfast on 24th Floor. Breakfast staff were professional and very attentive and food was great. ( Special thanks to the lady who cooks Eggs and Pancakes. Her pancakes are amazing ).",2,2021,08,21
28,Very Classy Hotel,"A little bit out of the way from the main sights in Barcelona but the Metro underground is very easy to use in order to get around the City.
Excellent breakfast and Staff are super on it this is what EVRY hotel should be.",5,2021,08,08
28,The best service ever 5 ⭐️,"Me and my husband got robbed the first night in Barcelona. This hotel did everything possible to try helping us through a difficult and ruined getaway.

The two managers and one lady at the reception was really nice and helpfull with all that we could ever wish for🙏🏻(Helping us 24/7).  The room is nice and clean👌🏻. It is a safe hotel during this Covid time. The pool area is great. A lot of sun and great service at the pool bar.

Breakfast at 24 level is amazing⭐️.

The location is perfect, close to everything and easy to walk from the hotel and down to the beach.

I can’t wait to go back.
This hotel is a must if you are visiting Barcelona 😉.
We will visit this hotel again in the beginning of next year, That’s for sure.

Thank you so much for the pleasant stay guys🙏🏻❤️.

Best regards Maria 🌸",5,2021,08,02
28,"Wonderful staff, great rooms, will definitely return!","We stayed here during our first trip to Barcelona in July 2021 and it was a great base for exploring the city. It's not in the middle of a tourist district, which is nice because there are plenty of shops, restaurants, cafes, etc for locals rather than tourist traps. Plenty of fun places to eat on the Rambla de Poblenou, which is only a few blocks away, and the tram and metro are nearby. There are lots of pharmacies, convenience stores, etc nearby for small things you need to pick up. The section of the Avinguda Diagonal that passes by the hotel is a lovely place to walk, especially in the evening, with lots of locals jogging, taking family walks, pushing babies in strollers, etc.

The staff at the hotel are extraordinary, especially the staff in the Level lounge. Alba and Diogo were two of the nice people who helped us, as well as an Italian guy whose name I don't remember who was incredibly kind. Anything you asked for, they would go out of their way to find. My husband fell and got injured while we were walking around the city and the hotel staff bent over backwards to help us and provide anything they could to assist. They were genuinely concerned and we greatly appreciated their help during our entire trip. They also helped us figure out how to get COVID tests for our return to the US. All the staff spoke perfect English and they were also kind and gracious when I wanted to practice my Spanish with them. :-)

The snacks and drinks offered every day from 12-8 in the Level lounge on the 25th floor were really nice, especially being able to grab cold drinks whenever we wanted them during the day. The views of the city from up there are spectacular. The price difference to upgrade to Level was minor and definitely worth it.

The housekeeping staff were amazing--you never saw or heard them, and yet somehow the rooms were always cleaned early in the day and everything was spotless! We had a gorgeous sea view from our room on the 21st floor. Our only complaint about the room was that in the evening it was dark because there wasn't great lighting, but that is a common design choice in fancy hotels these days, so it wasn't a surprise. There were plenty of outlets for charging devices. One evening our air conditioning didn't seem to be working correctly, so we called downstairs and within 10-15 minutes, the air blowing into the room got much colder, without anyone having to come to the room. That was especially nice since it was about midnight! Bed was comfortable.

The only thing we didn't love was the breakfast buffet...the choices were somewhat limited and repetitive, and it's pricey for what you get. But the staff there was friendly, and the views from the breakfast area are amazing.

We will definitely return to the Level at Melia Sky the next time we're in Barcelona. Thanks to the wonderful staff!",5,2021,07,15
28,Personalized,"The best are the views here. Prebook level room or pay upgrade in the hotel, its definetely worth it, it feels like at home. I wouldn't stay anywhere else, this is the place to be. Thank you to all the team. ",5,2020,03,28
28,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights whilst we explored Barcelona. We were not sure about staying a little way away from the main areas but we are so glad we did. It wasn’t touristy, the views of the sea and the city were a great advantage to other hotels. The breakfast is spectacular! Amazing selection and top quality food. Plus those views whilst you eat!!  
The bed room was incredible! Great views, very comfortable bed and great shower! 
Next time I am in Barcelona I will definitely be staying here and will recommend it to 
anyone who is travelling there.",5,2020,03,12
28,Excellent hotel,"Services was very dedicated. Staff was proffessional and correct. Breakfast is amazing, try the omelettes. View from sky bar was fantastic, not so stunning from the room. It was very clean and with modern furniture. I would come back to this hotel, definitely.",5,2020,03,06
28,Would stay again,"We stayed in room 2901 which overlooked the City with an amazing view especially in the mornings, only minor criticism of the room was the floor tiling came up and the shower door didn't close all the way so could leak during showering.

But as a hotel overall it was a beautiful stay, we checked in at the Level Lounge 2 hours earlier than usual and the room was already prepared and waiting for us, we prior to coming had a selection of pillows and other amenities. The Tapas on selection everyday was great and we enjoyed the Happy Hour on one of the evenings, I would say booking a room with Lounge access was well worth it, we were just unlucky that the period we have gone the pool was not open, I could imagine just how amazing the hotel would be in the summer.

The staff in the hotel were friendly and always willing to help and the breakfast in the mornings on the 24th floor had some AMAZING views again overlooking the sea as you took in a great spread of breakfast choice.",4,2020,02,17
28,Amazing luxurious stay,"I had a lovely, premium, amazing stay at The Level! Its a big luxurious hotel & staying in The Level rooms was worth EVERY penny. High floor with scenic views. Access to the Spa area with jacuzzi, sauna & steam room. The room was clean, spacious and I really loved the shower area. 

If you dont pay for the buffet breakfast you can have a Continental breakfast free of charge at the Lounge each morning. The staff were very friendly & polite. The level Lounge was the best part. They start serving snacks from approx 12 noon to 10 pm. The snacks were delicious, filling & there was so much variety, its pretty much a whole meal. 

Plus the Level has complimentary alcohol (all kinds and free flowing!) , drinks, tea, coffee throughout and stunning views. If you dont want to be catching taxis, its very close to Poblenau metro which links you to other metros. Wifi worked perfectly. The Level was so good, I highly recommend it, thank you for the amazing stay",5,2020,01,07
28,rekomenderas,"Another wonderfull stay at Melia Barcelona Sky. This time I had my daughter and grandchildren with me and we stayed in The Level Excutive Junior Suite, loved it. I can not fully express my gratitude to the staff at this hotel, everyone is a gem and especially  Ariana that came with a birthday cake and sang for my grandson.Thank you so much, I most definitely will  come back on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2019,10,22
28,Excellent experience,"Everything about our stay was brilliant, from the free cava on arrival to the excellent room with views over the Mediterranean Sea. We had free drinks and snacks, including wine, beer or cava every evening and it was excellent too. The staff are extremely attentive and knowledgeable and were great at attending to our every need. 

If you book through booking.com dont take the breakfast option for 25 euros as it’s cheaper to get it at the hotel when you arrive. 

Overall, we cant recommend this hotel enough. It was a perfect base to explore Barcelona. ",5,2019,10,12
28,"Staff are 5*, hotel is not","Let me begin by saying that I could not fault the staff whatsoever.  They provide excellent customer service and are committed to providing a comfortable, friendly stay.  They are worthy of five stars.

The Sky Level hotel itself is another matter.  I appreciate the attempt at futuristic design, but using linoleum flooring throughout the rooms is not modern or luxurious; it betrays the cost-cutting focus of the builders and looks as much.

The biggest problem, however, is the mould/mildew.  This is a significant issue that should not be overlooked, speaking as someone who, unfortunately, has an allergy to it.  Floor 24 and 25 are fresh and mould-free given the exposure to clean air, but floor 23 and all of the elevators are rife with it.  I was forced to take antihistamines by the second day because of it, and by the fifth day had become quite unwell.  By day six, the air conditioning that had occasionally helped refresh the air somewhat began to emit the smell of sulphur in the mornings.  A possible gas leak, or dead animal in the ventilation system?  Having returned home, my health is improving, but everything in our luggage, including the case itself, smells of mould.  I appreciate many hotels prevent windows from opening as they may pose a safety risk, but there are also health risks in prolonged exposure to mouldy environments.  This issue needs to be taken seriously and addressed properly to make the building worthy of 5*.",3,2019,10,11
28,Prison hotel,The hotel is not near any decent attractions and is designed like a prison. Everything g is stainless steel including the doors and it is extremely claustrophobic. The face is that one of the people in our party experienced a panic attack because of it.,1,2019,09,25
28,5* quality hotel and service,"Modern 5* high floor hotel midway between the city centre and beach with excellent transport links.
Service by staff excellent and the quality of accommodation, food and drink is 5*. We enjoyed a jnr suite on floor 29 with access to the breakfast and happy hour lounge on floor 24 and The Level reception and Lounge offering 24 hr snacks and drinks all of which were great and worth the extra cost of The Level accommodation.
Pre stay information and assistance provided by receptionist Paola was truly excellent.
The high quality of service and hard work by Agustin who runs the canapés and drinks service for a Level guests was greatly appreciated, many thanks.",5,2019,09,25
28,High Luxury,"We splurged By staying on the concierge floors of the Melia Sky in order to be close to the convention center. It was such a treat! Buffet breakfast each morning overlooking the mediterrean sea from the 24th floor. Fresh fruits and juices, typical cured meats and cheeses, various hot dishes to self serve from the stove top and omlettes cooked to order if you wish. Also served complimentary drinks and tapas every evening. It is seasy to make this your dinner if tired from your day. The Level lounge on 25th floor offered snacks, sandwiches and beverages - including beer and wines- throughout the day. Dedicated Level concierge staff were friendly and helpful. Room was very clean, modern with long distance view of sea from 22nd floor. Nespresso coffee in room. Shower and tub bath. Located on tram line and close to metro. Taxis readily available. 15 minute safe walk to beach. A wonderful treat of a hotel. Would love to stay again!",5,2019,09,10
28,The experience was not so nice.,The hotel is pretty ok but the rooms at the level are not so nice. I was at Melia in wiena and is total different then Melia sky Barcelona. More beautiful the rooms are so nice on Melia wiena. Not booking again to Melia Sky Barcelona . Was a bad experience!,2,2019,09,09
28,Excellent stay,"Stayed there again this year for a few days, business and leisure and couldn’t recommend enough. This Was my fourth time in the hotel. The location is great close to the metro Poblenou or tram and close to the beach also. The hotel os modern and the room are well designed ans spacious with beautiful views of the city, or the beach depending where you are staying. Access to the lounge was a plus, tapas every day at  6 pm and with a great choice of food and beverages and beautiful view on the 24th floor of the hotel. The lounge during the day was great too, opened from 7am to 10pm. But I must say that the staff were brilliant and so welcoming, obliging and professional, a special mention to Hugo who was extremely helpful and who looked after us very well, by also recommending some brilliant excursions. He is extremely passionate about his work and always want to make customers feel welcomed. I would come back and hope he will still be there. So would highly recommend. ",5,2019,08,24
28,Good Hotel Overall,"Just back from a great 5 night stay at the Melia Sky. Hotel location good. Away from hubbub of busy beach area. Liked electric scooters in reception! Great fun/very handy to get about (not for the under 15s). Rooms: clean, modern, good views. TV only shows news channels. Staff helpful/friendly. Breakfast okay. Not outstanding. No cereals, such as corn flakes, bran flakes, etc.  Good fruit, juice and yogurt selection. Pool area attractive. Not huge. Didn't open until 9am. 8am would be better. Be warned: on weekends it's party time at the pool. Noisy! Crammed! Forget relaxing there on a Saturday afternoon! Lifts are slow. Choose a higher floor room. Views are good. Overall this is a decent hotel. We were very happy with our stay there. ",4,2019,08,12
28,Mini break with family - driving ,"We stopped here for two nights whilst driving from south spain to south of France. I was slightly concerned about navigating through the traffic to get to the hotel but actually it was very quiet and not an issue at all. Parking is next to the hotel also which was easy and was €25 a day.

We had a lovely experience from check in on floor 25 to the gift they gave my 8 year old daughter on arrival. Lot of nice personal touches (booking the restaurants, sun loungers etc ...)

Staff were so helpful and gave a relaxed calmness to the hotel.

The facilities with the drinks and snacks on levels 24/25 were excellent and my daughter was also wanting to go at least twice a day to get snacks and drinks. It was really well done, great variety and choice (for free/included).

The pool area was nice, slightly small but to be expected for a cut Centre hotel. The bar on level 24 was lovely, great setting and views.

Rooms were nice, we were on 18th floor and the views were amazing!!! 

Fabulous trip, well looked after and we will defiantly return to this hotel.",5,2019,08,05
28,Staff and the extras made this a 5!,"Stayed in a standard room in the Level on 15th floor - as we arrived early we were offered an upgrade on check in to an available room on a higher floor but was told the room was exactly the same just on a higher floor, so we decided to leave our bags and head out for a while.

Check in is on the 25th floor at the Level Lounge - this is also where they serve all day drinks (soft, cava, wine etc) and snacks (sandwiches, crisps, nuts etc). Staff were really helpful and professional - nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. They also provided great recommendations on places to eat.

Breakfast and tapas time (18.00-19.30) are served on 24th floor in the Sky Bar - the view here is great - a lovely way to start the day. Breakfast was a great buffet selection of the usual goods, pastries, breads, cakes, hot foods plus eggs made to order - the staff at breakfast were friendly and attentive, they even presented me with a birthday cake one morning - which was a total surprise - but a wonderful touch.

Tapas time had a great selection of tapas - with some different dishes served each evening - staff were keen to introduce the dishes to everyone and again there are free drinks served here during tapas time. 

The pool is pretty small and not really a pool for swimming in - there weren't very many sun loungers for the size of the hotel and the use of the pool as a pool club exacerbated this issue. But once you could get a space to lounge in then it was lovely. The spa facilities were very lovely and very quiet when we went - definitely worth a visit.

The nearest metro station is about a 5 min walk away and it is only a handful of stops into the main tourist areas. It was nice to stay in a less touristy area with lots of local shops and restaurants.

The only minor issue during our stay was that the room was not quite upto a 5 star level when compared to other hotels - it could do with a bit of a refurbishment - the flooring was gapped and on one of the panels one of the corners was significantly damaged and sticking up which I would not expect - it would also have been nice to have a couple of hooks next to the shower to hang up clothes when showering etc. I have dropped one for cleanliness as the carpet in the corridor was significantly marked and the cups in our room had not been changed after we used them. But all minor issues.

Overall a fabulous hotel - the happy friendly staff and all the extras from the Level Lounge and Sky Bar made this a wonderful stay and extremely good value.

Would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,08,01
28,Value for money!,"Very modern and nice hotel.

We took one of the rooms in the 'level' category. These rooms are from the 24th floor and up. Money very well spent. Its just a little extra but all day one can make use of the lounge where they serve (for free) fresh drinks (cava, wine, juices, sodas, water) and snacks (from tapas to chips to sweets, to salads) all day. The pool is nice and its turned into a club scene (with DJ) in the weekends. The rooms are nicely decorated and modern. We loved the breakfast on the 24th floor, very very nice view and food.

The walk to the beach is a bit longer than other hotels, but the hotel is really worth it. I' m definitely coming back next time.",5,2019,07,29
28,Lovely hotel great location,"Can’t recommend this hotel highly enough it’s the first time we have stayed outside the centre of Barcelona and we would definitely come back Poblenou as a destination is about 10 minutes away from the centre on the metro and benefits from less crowds and some great places to eat.

Bedroom was lovely looking over the city and the sea, great air conditioning which we needed!

Level Lounge the staff were really friendly and always very positive even when dealing with complaining guests (police had to be called for one man who was totally out of order) and then they apologised to us.  Always plenty of drinks and food if required

Happy Hour more than enough to eat with the largest selection I have ever seen in a Level Lounge again beautiful setting looking over the city on floor 24

The breakfast staff were amazing when you got out of the lift it felt like they were excited to see you, asking about what you had been doing and what the plans were for the day, also reminding you to drink plenty water due to the heatwave!

Forget the negative reviews that you read on here it is a lovely hotel with really friendly staff",5,2019,07,28
28,Great Hotel great Staff,"Stayed st the level Barcelona Sky Hotel. Excellent from check in to check out 
Great facilities good room and excellent service from all 

Highly recommended and will use again 

The Sky Bar on the 25th floor is a must",5,2019,07,25
28,Perfect stay,"My wife and I had the pleasure of a short stay in July, the booking was very well handled by the hotel. A lot of moving part due to many commitments, but the hotel delivered first class.
We had an executive Jr suite with sea view, spacious and clean, with top notch view.
The breakfast on the 24th floor was first class, welcoming staff, rich menu truly a nice way to start the Day.
Follow up and support throughout our stay was the hotel mantra, merely getting hold of lost luggage was taken care of by the level Staff. Great.
The hotel is situated close to the beach, 10 min walk, and the neighbourhood is very relaxed and seems very safe.
To Follow up, we tried the hotel restaurant, fine- but I will go and exploit locals restaurants next time.
In the gym, pse add more fitness kit, weights etc, running outdoor is fine.

Melia, Thank you, we will be back.

28,"Disappointing, not worth the upgrade.  All for show but far from polished.","Booked last minute yet our overall experience was not worth the upgrade and it was definitely not good value for money. I think the overall impression is promising and looks good on paper, but for the price, I personally would shop around or stay again only if there was a great offer. You don´t plan on spending much time in the hotel when visiting a lively city, however you still want to feel as though you are getting your money´s worth.

On initially entering our room, my friend and I decided that it wasn´t what we were expecting and had a quick look on the booking site that we had used to compare. We found the same room for around 100€ cheaper than what we had paid and also an upgraded room that appeared much nicer for a small difference. We inquired at reception if we could upgrade and pay the difference, however, the price presented to us was a lot more than what was shown on the booking site and the price difference could not be explained.

Barcelona is a compact city yet at all turns it was clear that quality and practicality had been severely compromised in favour of cramming in as many rooms as possible:
- In the lobby we found only 4 lifts for 25 floors meaning we waited a while each time.
- Rooms were small considering the price paid.
- Single rail was squashed into the bathroom with 1 shelf above, rather than separate wardrobe area.
- Breakfast/dining area is in the lobby next to the entrance which doesn´t create a nice ambiance for the diners. (Also, we found out that breakfast was not included...)
- Pool area is small which is normal for high rise Barcelona hotels however, it promotes itself as a pool club, which intensifies the situation. Small pool + small space + lots of beds + lots of guests (residents and day guests). 

I was staying with a close friend which was fine, however there were a few details about the room that would have been uncomfortable otherwise:
- A window separating the bathroom and bedroom that could only be partially covered by a mirror. 
- No door between the bathroom ´area´ and bedroom.
- There was a separate door covering the shower and one for the toilet, however it was only partly frosted. 
- Overall, total lack of privacy which makes going to the toilet/showering/getting dressed not the smoothest of experiences.

The level promotes a ´lounge´ with complimentary drinks and snacks. This was a nice touch and one of the elements that interested me prior to our visit, however once again it didn´t meet the standard that i was expecting. It was a small buffet selection, with drinks, sandwiches, bread and nibbles available but the execution was lacking, such as bottled empty and had to ask for a new one, no label on the items to explain what they were, arrangement hadn´t been thought through (pots of hummus next to pots of mango pudding).

Staff were friendly and helpful at check-in and when we needed assistance.

Underground parking is available at a next door car park, however it is not subsidised.

Although the city is relatively easy to get around and most places can be walked to, this hotel is a bit on the far side if you are planning to spend time in the centre, especially as there is nothing of interest in that area. Taxi´s are easy to come by, but neither the price nor quality is worth the time spent in a taxi considering the abundance of hotels available on every street corner.

All in all, there were no dramas or anything that ruined our trip but the reality was far from the standard that was promoted and the had we paid a lot less, the lack of detail and execution would not have been a problem.",2,2019,07,09
28,Disappointed,"Unfortunately we booked this hotel because we got gold membership from mélia. But this hotel not reaching even the 3 star quality :( never again in this hotel! Dirty room, plastic floor and wall, no hygiene kit, uncomfortable bed, unfriendly and not professional  staff - when I asked where is the smoking area?! They get lost the 4th person gives me the answer:(  You have to wait 3-10 minutes to get the lift.  The rooms are not sound proof. I had to call the reception at 10pm because 2 levels up was a party in the room And we felt we are in the party as well. The pool area is really small and busy with noisy music. They ask me to do the online check in because after is will be faster in the hotel, but in the hotel takes 30 minutes to check in again, so I don’t understand why they offered me online the fast service because is not true!",1,2019,06,17
28,"Good views, unwelcoming service ","Visited the bar on Level 24, excellent views of Barcelona and a really good atmosphere in the bar, also reasonable prices for the drinks considering the views and location. However, before we had even finished half our drinks a bill was bought to our table that we hadn’t asked for, and shortly after the card machine followed prompting us to pay, not asking if we were interested in purchasing any more drinks or food or asking us if we needed anything, almost felt as if we were indirectly being asked to leave - very unwelcoming. ",2,2019,06,15
28,Romantic break away!,"We stayed at this hotel almost 3 yrs ago and were excited to go back. Sometimes places are never quite as good second time but this was actually a bit better.
The staff are so welcoming at check in. Always nice to be greeted with a glass of chilled cava. The level lounge has a good selection of snacks, nuts, cakes, pastries, crisps, fruit, bread  and soft drinks, wines and hot drinks. 
The biggest change from last tome
Is the use of the sky bar for breakfast-
What an incredible view to have as you eat . Also from 6-7.30 there is a snack hour with some great tapas and a free bar. On our first evening we actually didn’t bother with dinner as we are so many lovely treats!
Rooms are great, we had a city view room which had everything we needed and a super shower. Nespresso machine always winner for us! 
We used the pool on the Thursday, we had planned to spend Fri at the pool as weather was better but they closed it to get set up for a pool party that was happening on the Saturday. We did not get this info until
Thursday at about 4pm- had we been told at check in we may have swapped our day plans around. So that is really our only disappointment.  

",5,2019,06,08
28,Ideal,"Took my partner here for 4 nights last month. I paid more than I normally would for this hotel, but the benefits (free drinks and snacks on the 24th floor with a GREAT view) made it worth it. 

The location (we thought) was great. About 5-10 walk to the nearest metro to head all over sthe city. The actual area of the hotel is quite quiet and out of the way, but we liked that. Only a short walk away to several shops/food stores. 

The room was great and had all the amenities we needed. The only downfall was that the air con barely seemed to work. I would’ve taken a star off this had we complained and nothing was done. However we didn’t complain so I can’t take a star off as I imagine they would have sorted it if we did. The view was just beautiful. We didn’t use the pool as we didn’t really have time. 

I would love to stay here again one day. ",5,2019,06,05
28,Exceeded My Expectations!!,"Stayed here for 3 nights post our cruise.  Loved every minute of it from the check-in and glass of champagne, to the aptly furnished rooms.

Our room had amazing views and indeed we could see La Sagrada Familia. 

Breakfast was buffet style but they concentrated on quality rather quantity which was perfect. Reception and concierge staff went above and beyond. We would not hesitate to go back again.",5,2019,05,18
28,Amazing!,"We have stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and we are very pleased with it. The room is amazing with a fantastic view. The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially Victor in the bar on floor 24, we will definitely be returning to stay here again!",5,2019,05,15
28,Can’t recommend this hotel enough,"Me and my partner came here on April 29th for 5 days it was our first time in Barcelona and we had the most amazing time we stayed at the level and would stay here again the staff were amazing and couldn’t do enough for you! The hotel was clean and had beautiful views ! 

Would highly recommend paying that little extra to stay at the level !",5,2019,05,07
28,Another superb Melia hotel,Visited this hotel for two days had a sea view suite on 22 floor.   The hotel is beautiful from the lobby bar and restaurant to the level lounge which is on the 25th floor.   The staff are so friendly and the room was very comfortable.   The outdoor pool area is very relaxing and not too busy.  I would recommend this place.,5,2019,05,06
28,Meliá Spa Experience,"I just wanted to say something about amazing woman i had Opportunity to meet in YHI wellness. Its was really rainy day And me And my flance we Deicided to take some relax in hotel spa. I booked the most exlusive treatment And i excpected something magical.

It was brillant And im so thankfull that i did it! I never been so Satisfied in hotel spa before! Top top Top! Viva Argentina!",5,2019,05,04
28,Superb few days for Husbands 40th Birthday,"We stayed at The Level for 3 Nights earlier in April for my husbands 40th Birthday.
When we arrived we took the elevator to the 25th floor to check in. We were greeted by a very friendly girl who told us to take a seat and offered us a cold glass of champagne. Great first impression. The girl who checked us in was extremely polite and friendly (sorry didn't get her name) she showed interest and could tell we were hear for my husbands birthday and wished him a Happy Birthday. After check in we relaxed in the lounge next to reception which has complementary drinks and food throughout the day and evening. We then went to our room. The room was on the 18th floor and had great views over Barcelona. The room was fantastic, modern, great view, fab bed, bathroom with a huge shower all was spotless clean. The hotel had also arranged a welcome card, balloons and cake for my husbands birthday. Superb touch. The Hotel is about 10 minute walk to Rambla del Poblenou which has tons of great restaurants to eat. A further 15 minutes walk at the bottom of Rambla del Poblenou you will come to the beach. There is also 2 shopping centres close to the hotel in both in the opposite location so doesn't matter which way you go you will get to either one. Centre of Barcelona is around a 45 minute walk. We did walk it one of the days but then stuck to the open top bus. There is a tram service, metro and local buses that all stop outside the hotel to. Hotel has a decent bar which we had a couple of drinks in one evening. Breakfast, good choice of food, did the job. Chef will cook fresh eggs of whatever sort if you ask. Breakfast was also served on the 27 floor I think and has incredible sea views across Barcelona. Staff in the hotel were fantastic, every single member of staff we interacted with were all extremely friendly  speaking to tmyku and showing interest. The girls who work in the restaurant at Breakfast in the morning, especially one of the greeters at the door who took name and room number was so friendly to, she had brown hair, always had it in long ponytail style again sorry didn't get her name, she was fantastic. We had a perfect 3 days away, thank you to everyone at a The Level for making our first trip to Barcelona and my Husbands 40th Birthday such a memorable one. ",5,2019,04,27
28,Fantastic Hotel,"Visiting for our anniversary, the hotel surprised us with a bottle of bubbly & chocolates in the room, room is fantastic, brilliant views across the city, breakfast was superb, well worth the little bit extra we spent",5,2019,04,18
28,Amazing Hotel,"We took an Anniversary trip and stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. We checked in on the 25th floor and were greeted by the nicest most eager to assist team (Poul and Poula, no relation). We booked a city tour and made couples massage appt at the same time of checking. The commentary champagne and beverages and snacks was a wonderful way to express guest appreciation. We upgrade our room to seaview and included breakfast. Every staff member we encountered was genuinely hospitable. The food was great. The location was 4 min walk from the train station and 12 min from the beach. The gym and spa area was also nice. We loved out stay here!",5,2019,04,08
28,Great Stay ! Lovely Team.,"We loved this hotel and it’s location in Poblenou, just a walk to the beach and very close to the town centre. Poblenou rambla was not too bad either.......The hotel is well appointed and the “level” has a great lounge for snacks and cocktails, the breakfast in the bar on the 24/F is a welcome bonus. The staff are very well trained but most importantly so welcoming and engaging. Will return.  ",5,2019,04,04
28,"Wow, Where are we?","For those who are in Barcelona to party this is not your hotel, unless by partying you mean vegging by the pool having EXCELLENT service, AMAZING food & UNBELIEVABLE wine. 
The Level is located in an Uber local, true neighborhood part of Barcelona, seems so foreign to the city we know and love (to us outsides). That said is a gem like you would not believe. The hotel begins at the 25th floor, since you arrive you are tended to, when we mean tended to we mean, the staff looks at you in the eyes and engages with you, never intimidated but warm and hospitable. 

The area where guests are checked in feels like the personal shopping area at a luxury department store or designer boutique. The area is on the interior of the property so you somehow forget you are in a 25th Floor, once all that is completed and you are escorted to you room, the view as you step off the elevator takes your breath away. Barcelona on its totality, uninterrupted from beach to mountain.
The entire property is designed around metal, a departure from the feminine lobby but it works. Room has exactly what you need, dark, sexy, great mattress, lux bathroom.

For us this was the detox last stop after a 3 day festival, great for adults who want to disconnect or for a bit from the busy BCN summer or for an undetected quiet trip.

100% Recomended - Pool is small but awesome!",5,2019,03,09
28,Great Hotel out of the way from the business of Barcelona,"This is a great hotel to enjoy Barcelona!  It's out the way of main tourist area, however, close to a tramline and also just off the route for the hop on & off bus tour. 

Its a few block away from the Beech and a very modern and cleanly presented hotel.

We went for the Level Experience, meaning that you get to stay in the top part of the hotel. This provides you with separate checkin floor, lounge, and amenities that you do not receive staying at the normal part of the hotel.

The rooms are exactly how you see them on the website and on trip advisor and they do not disappoint.  The bed is large and comfortable, the room itself offers ample room compared to other city destinations.  Great wardrobe space and a spacious w/c and shower facility.  This is a very modern room, if some people are looking for something a little more traditional, then you should be aware that a clear panel of glass simply separates the main room to the bathroom effectively. 

The restaurant use to have a Michelin Star Chef, however, this is not the case.  So we found that there was only the restaurant in the main part of the Hotel, on the ground floor to be the only place to have an evening meal.  What use to be the exclusive restaurant at the top of the hotel, is used for Level Guests for breakfast and they have cleverly used this to their advantage.  The breakfast is very good, offering a large selection for you to choose from. 

The hotel also has some nice spa facilities and a roof top pool and deck space, just be aware that the pool is not on the top floor, however, the way it has been designed is clever and offers those who don't want to venture out of the hotel an opportunity to soak up some sun with the option of cooling down in a small pool.  For those who are looking for a more active or exercise pool experience it would not suffice.  

Would recommend this as a great hotel to stay in Barcelona.",4,2019,01,09
28,Amazing view,"Came to Barcelona many times and decided to stay in a different location, and picked this hotel as it’s part of the Melia chain where we have platinum membership level. It did not disappoint. 

We got in a few hours before check-in time but they were nice to offer us a room upon arrival. Our upgrade got us an incredible sea view. 

Had breakfast every morning on on the terrace at the restaurant on the 24th floor (a must, see the pic of the sunrise). The staff were incredibly nice and offered us a complementary bottle of cava and cake in the room as a birthday surprise. 

Truly a great place to stay, and a good value. Worth mentioning was the above and beyond attention from the manager Mrs. Alba, and Pauletta from the Level lounge who recognized us from our stay at other Melia hotels and made us feel even more at home here. 

Will definitely be returning again in the future ",5,2019,01,05
28,Beautiful Barcelona at The Level,"We have just returned from our vacation at The Level. First Class hotel, and service. The level is certainly the highlight.. with amazing views of the city and contemporary decor. Yummy yummy...Snacks and drinks all day available in The Level, which is clean and contemporary. 

Shopping was close by with great shops and restaurants. Had the best nights sleep on a lovely bed with a choice of pillows for extra comfort.

The spa was nice too, lots of treatments on offer and a lovely hot tub that was clean and well kept.

Big thank you to all the staff especially Marta and Guest Experience Manager Sofia Cutin, who really looked after us during our stay. We were feeling so unwellduring our stay, however Sofia made us feel such special guests and spoilt us with treats which was first class and amazingly professional. She took the time to speak with us upon arrival and upon departure. Nice touch. Thank you so much to all the staff at Meliá Sky! Amazing staff and beautiful hotel",5,2018,12,16
28,Nearly but not quite,"This is a hi rise hotel with the level on the 5 top floors. location is a bit out of the center but the local area is nice and Barcelona is big so in a way it doesn't matter. views form 29th floor our room and breakfast 24th floor were great. Service nice and friendly. unfortunately it was marred by a poorly cleaned room, lack of toiletries ie one soap and no shower caps, smells form the hand basins and a shower that leaked- although the latter was fixed. Breakfast was pretty good - not first class. The Levels snacks canapes and drinks selection was below expectations and needs improvement. We might return but there is plenty of choice in Barcelona. We were  overall just about satisfied but but did not pay too highly for the room.",4,2018,12,10
28,Great stay - lovely hotel,"3 nights at the Level during 22-25 October 2018.  A really nice hotel, arrived two hours early but they had a room available for us.

Check-in is great, quick and very helpful staff in the private reception on the 25th floor. A nice glass of Cava upon arrival too!

The Level is really nice, you are guaranteed a high room with a great view, i 'd booked a sea view room and it was STUNNING. The room is very nicely decorated and the bathroom is gorgeous, hug rain shower, double sink and bath which can you look out into the room/view.

Also with the Level you get access to the Lounge where there are always complimentary drinks and snacks, we used a little but we were out sightseeing most of the time. During 1800-1930 there are free drinks at the stunning terrace lounge on the 24th floor. This is what makes the level, it is like a Manhattan cocktail bar or Sky Garden in London, simply breathtaking.

The breakfast is excellent too again served in the terrace which make it all the more special. We had great service at breakfast except our last day when were there at 715am to leave early and no one came to serve us which was a little disapointing but good both other times.

The hotel location is good, not central but there is a taxi rank right outside which always had several cabs, 10 mins to center/Sagrada and 35 mins fixed price to the airport,  Also we got the metro and Poblenou is a 3-5 minute walk and gets you to the center (Jaume 1) in fifteen mins door to door from the hotel.  I'm a runner so it's under a mile to the beach and you can go for a great traffic free run along the beach, lovely esp early morning.

My wife and I both loved our stay here and would highly recommend this hotel for the staff, quality of the room and all the extras you get at the Level.",5,2018,10,30
28,Good hotel,"My partner and I visited this earlier this month, the place is really good, modern rooms, staff really friendly and a nice glass of cava on check in, the view from the bar on the 24th floor looks over Barcelona bay, lovely way to spend a couple of hours, five minute walk to the metro and then four or five stops and you in the city centre, recommend this hotel to anyone, keep up the good work. ",5,2018,10,24
28,Luxury hotel!,This is our go to hotel when we visit Barcelona. We have been back to this hotel three times and each time it has been perfect. We love the location and the views are amazing if you get a room high up. The level experience is worth it and offers you an additional area to relax and enjoy some down time.,5,2018,10,18
28,Nice stay but not 5*,"Stayed at The Level Melia Barcelona for 4 nights. The hotel was nice however there was a few issues that I experienced during my stay. Firstly, the check-in process was slow. The room, although a good standard of quality, was poorly cleaned. Over the 4 night stay, it wasn't hoovered. The tea and coffee was never replenished - I had to ask for this specifically from reception  - I have read this is an ongoing issue but I thought it was a standard offering in hotels of 3* and above?! One night I returned to the room and the towels had not been replenished, neither had the sink been cleaned and had soap left in the sink. The toiletries were only replenished once. The turn down service was just shutting of curtains, and one night we didn't even get that! The pool area was nice however in the afternoons there was no towels left and I had to ask the bar staff for these twice. The spa was nice however there wasnt any towels/moisturiser/conditioner etc in the changing rooms like other hotels of 4* standard provide in their spas.

The Level offering of free drinks and snacks was nice although it wasn't often replenished. Again on numerous occasions I had to ask for clean cups/spoons to make coffee. The hotel is situated in a nice, less-touristy area with nice restaurants. Breakfast was good with lots on offer, however the last two mornings of the stay there was no brown sliced bread as the hotel had ran out. The staff were generally happy to help and assisted with the problems encountered during the stay well. Overall, I believe The Level is still at a 4* grade of hotel, not 5.",3,2018,10,14
28,Anniversary Stay,"We stayed for 3 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a bit disappointing that despite the hotel being informed of that there was no recognition whatsoever. I'm also a Melia gold member, but didn't feel valued from check in to check out. Most of the staff were helpful, but a few were average to poor. Nice room, great views out to sea and a lovely bar area. The Level lounge was ok but not always properly maintained. Overall it was a lovely stay, but the experience could have been made much better with a bit of effort by the hotel. The breakfast was great and couldn't be faulted. We would return, but hopefully service levels and approach improves going forward.",4,2018,10,08
28,Wedding Anniversary Break,"My husband and I visited to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. I must say that the Level part of the hotel was really a luxury that you don't get even in many other five star hotels. The check in on the 25th floor was really a nice touch as they offer you a glass of Cava upon arrival. The area is also a lounge that is open for free refreshments and snacks from late morning until late. Really great if you just want somewhere to sit and watch TV or chat to your friends with a few nuts and a coke or something. 

The room itself was the usual Melia high standard and had wonderful views of the city since we were on the 18th floor. The buffet breakfast was also very nice on the 24th floor (again just for ""The Level"" customers). Really enjoyed the quality of food and wide selection to suit most people. The hotel tower is also in a more modern part of the city and around 10 minutes walk to the Glories shopping centre or 15 minutes walk to the beach. We loved Barcelona and the Melia was definitely the icing on the cake. Would absolutely stay here again!",5,2018,09,20
28,Lovely late summer break,"We stayed at the Level for 3 nights before taking a Mediterranean cruise from Barcelona. We loved the extra level of service and the lounge facilities....great views across the city, and nice to be able to drop in for drinks and snacks any time during the day. The breakfast in the main restaurant downstairs was also very good....we didn’t try breakfast on level 24. 

The room we had was modern and well equipped, we had a city view which meant you could see across the city  to the Sagrada Familia.

There was also a lovely rooftop pool and bar

Staff were all very friendly and helpful.

In terms of location, although it’s not in the traditional city centre, it is 5 minutes walk from a metro station, 10 minutes walk from the seafront, and we took a leasurely stroll of about 30 minutes to visit the Sagrada Familia. There is also a taxi rank right outside which seemed to always have several cabs waiting. At the end of our stay, a taxi to the cruise port was Euro16, for two people and luggage, and took 15-20 minutes.",5,2018,09,19
28,Loved every minute..,"Fantastic stay. From the moment we arrived we realised the level was somewhere that paid attention to the small details, the private check in on floor 25 and the level lounge is something that completely transformed our stay. The dos cielos lounge on floor 24 has self-serve snacks and alcohol; there is a happy hour exclusively for level guests from 6pm until 7.30pm each evening with some fantastic views over the coast of Barcelona. We spent most evenings in there before heading out. There is a restaurant called merkado adjacent to the reception area on the ground floor, which serves drinks and there is a menu for food although we never chose to eat there. 
There is free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel which makes it easier to catch up on emails etc. 
The hotel is simply stunning, from textured walls to smooth and sleek steel doors, something truly beautiful. We had a grand premium sea view room, the room had ample space and the bathroom was modern. The room was exceptionally clean, housekeeping came each day and changed the bedding and towels. The tv in the room has chromecast so you can stream videos from your device, e.g. netflix when in bed at night or getting ready to go out. Minibar in room filled with waters, juices, champagne and snacks that are chargeable to your room. Bathroom came complete with soft towels and bathrobes, there is no need to bring towels as they provide new ones each day. 
The rain effect shower was amazing and it was hard to tear ourselves away and often we were late going out for dinner as we had spent so long in the showers!
The bed was really comfy, the pillows are the best pillows i have ever slept on, we found out that you can buy these directly from melia for around 75€, i will be purchasing some for home!
The spa was beautiful, although nothing was signposted, we had to walk in and have a look around, we are glad we did. After a day shopping on passeig de gracia, we needed to relax, lovely steam room and turkish bath, it seemed really quiet too, not overcrowded which was lovely. 
Food and drinks were fantastic, our only issue is that there was sometimes a low availability of glasses and plates in the lounges, in the grand scheme of things it isn't really a problem.. we were also a little disappointed that there was no bacom on 2 of the 3 nights we stayed, and they are the only slightly negative issues we had during our stay. 
The breakfast that was included was simply... amazing! From a range of cereals, fresh fruits, cooked breakfast, pastries, dim sum, cooked meats and cheeses. There was a huge range of fresh fruit and yoghurt pots, oats, a honeycomb with fresh honey, the list is endless. There is also a grill where you can ask for something to be prepared, we recommend the eggs Benedict. It was lovely!
We are already looking to book for next year- i can't explain how much we loved our trip. It was an amazing weekend.

28,Lovely hotel but not perfect!,"I booked this hotel as we had stayed some years ago in The Melia Level in Alicante and had remembered it with fond memories. This was a very special occasion as we were celebrating our Silver Wedding Anniversary whilst we were there, and I had hoped the hotel would live up to expectations.
However, The Level at Barcelona Sky was not quite as memorable, for a few reasons.
Firstly, the room was nice and clean but we did not like the modern bathroom set up which could be seen and heard from the bedroom as it was not separate. It is probably ‘an age thing’ but a sliding glass door on the toilet is not for us!!
Secondly, it was slightly misleading if you go into the bar on 24th floor between 18:00-19:30pm and you go to the bar, you pay for drinks but if you go to the right you don’t!!!
We were given an info letter on arrival and it said we had late check out until 14:00pm but we had a knock on the door at 12:40pm from a guy who said we had to check out as we were late!!!!

On a positive note, Hannah on reception in The Level was excellent👍 Also, a young lady who was on duty at breakfast, very friendly and professional and she made the start to our ‘special day’  with a glass of bubbles🥂🥂
The location is a bit out of town but is right next to Avenue Diagonal which is lovely to walk down and it will bring you to various shopping areas and the train stations.
All in all, it was a great break, with a hotel that didn’t quite live up to expectations in a city which always does !!!!!",4,2018,09,16
28,Excellent!,"Excellent hotel! Check in is on the 25th floor where you are greeted by friendly helpful staff and a glass of cava.
We stayed on the 29th floor (top) with a city view, which was amazing. The room was beautiful, elegant, stylish, comfortable and equipped with everything!
We simply loved the lay out and it was super cool brushing your teeth whilst gazing out at the city.
Excellent views of the Sagrada Familia! It was amazing watching all the lights coming on over the city.
Every day between 18:00-19:30, on the 24th floor you can enjoy complimentary drinks and snacks, which was excellent. Drinks included cava, spirits, beer ( self service) and tasty snacks. Staff were lovely!
Views from the bar were of the sea, just so nice to sit, relax and enjoy a drink after a long day out!
Breakfast was excellent! A large selection of hot and cold choices, lots of fresh fruit, pastries, it was an excellent start to the day. Staff again were attentive and very nice. You could choose to eat in the restaurant with city views or the bar with sea views.
We didn’t use the spa or swimming pool, so can’t comment, but it always looked busy 
(you can see the pool area from the bar).
The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro - Poblenou L4
It’s very easy to get around, we travelled the entire city, even going to the Olympic Stadium and Camp Neu.
It’s well worth getting a multi day travel ticket, it’s €10.30 for a T10 ( 10 journeys) or it was €28.30 for a 96 hour unlimited trips on metro, bus, tram - excellent value for money.
We got the 96 hour and definitely got our moneys worth!
Get a taxi from the airport, it cost us €34 each way and took about 30 minutes. Make sure you ask the taxi driver to go round the city not through it! Public transport from the airport to the hotel involves buses and Metro and about a 90 minute journey.
The area around the hotel is a mix of lovely little restaurants and bars and run down buildings, which was a shame to see. Be prepared to wait for drinks, menu etc.. Locals appeared to get served much quicker than tourists. A 10 minute walk takes you to Poblenou Ramblas and lots of restaurants and bars. We ate here on our first night as we were too tired to venture out further. However, I would defintelty recommend eating in the city for the rest of your trip, as there is more atmosphere and choice.
Poblenou Ramblas leads directly to the beach ( 20 minutes).
Eating in the city, I would definitely recommend going to Placa Reial ( off Ramblas, before the Liceu Metro- walking from the beach). It’s a bustling square, with beautiful restaurants and a great atmosphere. I would highly recommend eating in My Way and Rossini. We could not get booked and decided to take a chance, we had a wait but it was well worth waiting for at both these restaurants.
We ate on Ramblas one lunch time and our drinks ( one each) cost more than our food!! So be aware that on average a beer/ sangria will cost you at least €10 each!
We were told to watch out for pick pockets, as Barcelona is rife, but to be honest we didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, originally from London, I actually felt safer and more comfortable than in London. 
Barcelona is a full on trip ( if you want to see as much as possible) so wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to cover some miles.
It’s definately worth visiting Camp Neu and the Olympic Staduim. At the stadium it’s free to get in and you can pay €2 each to go down on the track and take pictures, well worth it!
Enjoy Barcelona!",5,2018,09,12
28,"Friendly, Professional & Extremely Helpful","Friendly professional and extremely helpful service - none less so than from Beatriz Galiza who took excellent care of us each morning at breakfast (delicious selection of food). The vast sea sky and wonderful panoramas of Barcelona spread out below us were both relaxing and tranquil, and really added to the enjoyment of our holiday. All the big attractions easily reachable by the excellent public transport system (metro bus and tram nearby).",5,2018,09,04
28,Absolutely amazing,"This is to thank all the team at The Level Sky Barcelona.
We had a great stay and we will come back for sure.
Fernando, the breakfast manager, is absolutely attentive and professional. He made us feel welcome and like home every single day.
Room on 19’ floor was amazing. You can t stop staring at the landscape from the bed.Clean, comfy, sexy with a king size bed where sweet dreams are granted.
Walking distance to the sea and nice beaches though the pool is cool and relaxing.
We did not have the time to enjoy the spa but we will try it next time.
Free drinks and snacks on the 24 cielos are a cosy treat after a long day around beautiful Barcelona.
Breakfast is amazing, suitable for veg as well.
Fernando, Ines, Catherine, Javier, Diogo: muchas gracias. You did a great job!",5,2018,09,03
28,High class hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights with family and honestly could not fault our stay.Check in at the level very relaxed, seated with a glass of cava. Room had great views of sea and city and was very comfortable.All staff that we encounted were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was superb with plenty of choice for all tastes,and the free snacks and drinks available throughout the day was a real treat.Honestly cannot understand some negative comments on this site I would recommend this hotel and stay here again.",5,2018,08,26
28,Terrible terrible terrible ,"On arrival I waited to check in only 2 staff  at Reception so it took around 20 mins not so bad I guess
Reception then tell me the room I booked is no longer available so they moved me I then went to my room that was the wrong bed size I requested 
I book here lots due to the very good pool services but here is why I won’t stay here every again
The pool that looks so good on the pics is in use fri/sat for a pool party 200 people all drinking and being sick around the pool it’s terrible the place has turned from 5 star to 1 star I will not be returning ",1,2018,08,25
28,Not as impressive as it should be!,"This hotel had the potential to be very good and the hard product - ie the furnishing and the lounge concept is very good.  The staff let it down somewhat!

I had booked a room for 1 night.  Although check in was advertised as 3pm, I had to wait until nearly 4 to get a room.  I stayed in the lounge which does cava, red and white wine and beer plus nibbles all day.  

The hotel itself is a little out of the way - not a great deal to do around it without a walk or a taxi.  The lounge itself is nice - and always being restocked.  The evening canapés is in a different place - they were a bit disappointing to be honest - olives, nuts and some sandwiches -nothing in hot.  The wine and cava were in free flow though.

I also ate lunch at the pool bar - the food was good, as were the cocktail although they were a little pricey.  Be warned - this is a pool for the beautiful - folks strutting about with their Hermes scarves - I felt quite self-conscious as a ‘normal’ bodies person - not the hotels fault but just a warning - I was going to bring my mother here but decided not to based on this - she would have felt very uncomfortable.

The room was the biggest disappointment - it really was not luxurious.  It was quite minimal - the bed was hard, the bathroom was OK but looked right over the bedroom - no privacy.  The amenities were not great and the towels were very thin.

At breakfast the next morning the amount of tables there were left with dirty plates on it - no one to show you to your table and a bunch of staff that looked like they would rather be anywhere but here - not what you would wish for in a high end hotel.

Overall I just think I am not the right person for this hotel - the crowd were young - and maybe expected less but having stayed in quite a few top class hotels - this one fell way short despite all the promises.

I wont be staying in a Melia again.",3,2018,08,22
28,Very good but improvable,"Stayed there for 6 nights and it was all ok but unfortunatelly the room cleaning service is not a 5 star service. The housekeepers do the basics and don't clean accuratelly the bathroom. For 3 times I must call the reception to ask for something that was missing or not cleaned. 

The room and the bathroom are really good (vista mare room). There are all facilities and a modern furniture.
The swimming pool area is shared with 4 stars clients but it is a good place to relax. If you arrive early in the morning you can find place to stay and take the sun ;)

I recommend the hotel for sure but please ask your staff to be more accurate when cleaning rooms.

Emanuela",4,2018,08,13
28,"Great hotel, but","Great hotel.  Room are very nice, staff is fantastic. Great experance but

Only two of four elevators worked 
The level is nice however limited controls in place meaning anyone can take advantage of the services .. I don't think the level is as isolated from the remainder of the hotel.

My suggestion like other hotels
Card access to services 
Private elevator for level folks 

",3,2018,08,09
28,Fabulous family break,"We had an amazing week staying at The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky. We were warmly greeted by Jose at check in on the 25th floor and offered drinks and refreshments. We were an hour early and our family room was not yet ready so after giving us a few suggestions of things to do during our time in the city, Jose invited us to relax in the lounge where complimentary soft drinks, beers, wine, cava and snacks were available every day. 
Our family room was lovely with plenty of space for 2 adults and a 10 and 14 year old with spectacular views over the city. I could clearly see Sagrada Família from our window - Room 2606.
The pool area was small but very well maintained. It’s a real sun trap in the morning but not so good by late afternoon. Sun beds cannot be reserved so getting there early is the best way to get a space.
However the beach is only a 15 minute walk away.
The hotel gym is very small and not very well equipped but there is a good gym about 100 yards from the hotel called When U Want Fitness that only charged €20 for a week pass.
The breakfast buffet on the 24th floor is fantastic with so much choice of pastries, cereals, fruit, meats, cheeses and juice.
Hot bacon and sausages too with eggs being cooked to order.
We ate at various restaurants on Rambla Poblenou in the evenings, our favourite was El 9 Porro for amazing tapas.
I would highly recommend The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky.. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",4,2018,08,07
28,"Decent Hotel, Decent Experience ","Stayed 2 nights and really enjoyed the experience. Room was very comfortable and had the 5* trappings. Used the lounge on 25th quite a bit, nice. The bar on the 24th was really good! Breakfast was a good mixture of different tastes and all was cooked well

A couple of moans...

Lifts are terribly slow and made worse when one is not working

Finding a place at the pool to sunbathe is very hit and miss, it needs a system or the system should be followed",4,2018,08,03
28,Enjoyable stay,"Pleasant stay, but not a five-star hotel or experience.  Well-appointed, but small, room with bathroom behind the bed.  Unfortunately poor sound-proofing resulted in having to call reception at 4am after the neighbouring room decided to rock out!  Breakfast was good, although service was slightly hit-or-miss and cleaning of tables was slow.  Levels lounge and evening drinks were a nice addition.  Gym and pool were pleasant, but both very small.  A pleasant experience overall.",4,2018,07,28
28,A spacious luxury room in a quiet residential area,"Barcelona’s Poblenou is not a tourist hotspot. It’s a quiet (albeit densely populated) residential area with a fair number of bars and restaurants, but it’s not home to any of Barcelona’s best known sights. 

The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky is the high-rise portion of the rest of the hotel, with its own lobby and check-in desk. Unfortunately, check-in was a little more complicated than it needed to be (a bad sign when the front desk has guest chairs to sit at).

But the rest of the stay was magnificent. The room was probably bigger than our apartment, with a full bedroom, living room suite, full bathroom with tub and shower. It was clean, well-decorated and comfortably air conditioned. 

The hotel is a very short walk away from a metro station, about a 20 minute subway ride from Passeig de Gracia, 15 minutes to the Olympic Park and waterfront, and about 40 minutes total to Park Guell. Parking is in a secure garage beneath the building (30 EUR/day).",5,2018,07,28
28,Mixed Feelings,"Visited for a 3 night break with my partner, I choose the level over other 5 star hotels in the area in the belief it would be the preferable option.  The positives... Check in was quick and easy and the staff here were fabulous, helpful and friendly.  The views were just amazing from all areas of the Level.  Our bedroom was lovely with fantastic sea views, a great bed, lovely shower and very roomy.  We were on the 22nd floor and lifts were frequent and fast.  Breakfast was a delicious array of food with enough to satisfy.  The Level lounge we made great use of during our stay the soft and alcoholic drinks were plentiful and the snacks were tasty and refilled frequently.  The not so great..... we stayed for 3 nights and after the first morning of using the coffee pods, milk, sugar, cups, toiletries not one day after were these replenished without a call to reception.  Working in the service industry myself this is just a basic amenity which should be provided correctly daily and checked by superior staff.  Getting back in from a long day sight seeing to have to call down for these supplies became tiresome, we even spoke to the Level reception one morning to ask that our cups and coffees & toiletries were replenished correctly by the housekeeping team and still we arrived back to find this not done - 1 cup instead of 2, no milk or sugar, this is not 5 star.  Breakfast area felt a little cramped with tables too close together for comfort.  The Sunday afternoon we arrived to a private party at the pool area we were given a token for a free soft drink so popped in but as a previous reviewer said this was a party for youngsters, loud & busy.  Not a relaxing scene at all and it left us no where to relax by the pool.  On our last day we were sat in the Level lounge with a final glass of Carva prior to checking out which was at 12, at 1 minute to 12 one of the Level reception staff came over and asked  if we were going to check out now.  It felt a little rude and unnecessary, we were in full view of them and had our packed cases with us and half a drink in our glasses.  Prior to my visit I read a lot about the area the hotel was in and actually really appreciated the walk to the beach and the lovely local Ramblas, it was filled with Spanish people, great restaurants and provided a scenic walk to the beautiful beach which had a gorgeous beach bar.  We also caught the tram from the front of the hotel too into the city.  I actually preferred staying in this area to the centre of city where I had stayed previously which was teeming with tourists, this area is far more relaxing and you do feel you are in authentic Spain.  We used the hotel bar on the ground floor and the bar manager was a gem taking great care with the making of our cocktails, this bar was lovely for a late evening drink.  Would I stay again...… no, I would choose another hotel in this area and double check the pool area was for guests only and hope they managed the task of replenishing supplies in the room correctly.  Sorry The Level at Melia Sky I had high hopes for a great stay with you I paid a 5 star price but in truth I felt it was not a 5 star experience.",3,2018,07,26
28,"Not 5 star , would not stay here again","20 minutes wait to be checked in followed by 30 minutes for room to be ready when they should have been ready (did get a bottle of champagne delivered to room as an apology)

On a Friday from 3pm the pool area is outsourced to an events company who bring in 20 something’s for a pool party.  Guests are allowed to stay but not allowed next to the pool as this is now a vip section.  Bottles of beer went from being 5 euro to 8 euro.  Similar on a Saturday afternoon but not as busy.

Check in staff clueless, and not helpful.

Pool service very poor with attitude certainly not 5 star service.

Management trying to make extra money at the pool at the expense of paying guests.

If you are out all day and do not want to chill poolside you probably will have a different experience.

Sea view room was nice.  Staff on 24th floor were excellent and professional.

We normally stay at the grand hotel central and will be going back to staying there.",2,2018,07,25
28,Don’t stay if you want to relax a weekend by the pool,"Just got back from a weekend of relaxation and what I wanted to be by the pool which they advertise so nice. However.. this is NOT the hotel to stay at if you want to relax by the pool over a summer weekend. What they fail to let you know until you actually get these is that during the summer weekends the pool area turns in to an Ibiza club night for 18-25year olds who are not even staying in the hotel , and although as a hotel guest you get access to it, should you want a bed to lay on its €400!!! Or €800 for the larger double bed!! This is INSANE!!!!  Luckily the beach (although very crowded) is only 15min walk away otherwise there is not much in the area unless u get a 15min cab ride away. 
Staying at The Level which is suppose to be the higher end section of the hotel the service from 50% of the staff wasn’t very good at all. You would think after getting some award in 2012 and being 5 star, they would have managed to get it all on point with service and treating their guests the right away. 
THe Levels breakfast area.. if it’s sunny outside and start getting busy it’s like a sauna.. and the buffet is all laid out in the actual kitchen which is cramped for guests to walk around and the cheese melts and yogurts on display gets warm.. not that nice.. especially not in the “vip” section of the hotel.  Even when complaining nobody really seamed to care apart from when we checked out and someone took off the minibar bill and a bottle of wine we had ordered the night before. Otherwise we were recommended to write posts on trip advisor and they would learn from their mistakes.... hmm.. they admitted that lots of guest are unhappy.. but guess nothing really being done to change things. The hotel looks great but the surrounding area is has no character and it’s only residential . I have stayed in many Melia hotels.. would I stay in this one again when in Barcelona? that would be For sure a big fat NO!",1,2018,07,23
28,Disastrous stay,"Just spent 5 nights here with my daughter, as a girls trip away. From beginning to end we encountered issues and problems and staff with poor attitude, that really couldn't care less. There seems to be some deep seated discontent  amongst a lot of the staff. The simplest of requests would often turn into an ordeal. We had broken AC that had to be fixed twice, blocked sink and the block of slimy hair etc of previous guests was left in the room. Daughters dietary requirements (she has coeliacs) were not met and were told, at The Level Lounge, to order room service for her if she wanted something gluten free. Chocolates were eaten by housekeeper in our room. Room not cleaned properly with dirty dishes sitting for two days and no turn down service. Tea bags and shower gel etc were never topped up in the room. Room service wanted to charge 4.50euros to have some milk for the tea in the room, delivered. This is an example of only some of the problems we encountered. We tried to speak to management and were repeatedly fobbed off. Eventually  got to speak to the new Guest Experience manager, near the end of our stay. She was lovely, receptive and totally shocked by our experience. She did sort something out for us, but it cannot change the stress and upset that marred our stay in Barcelona. 
Rooms are modern, but there is nowhere to hang dresses as only low level open wardrobe in bathroom! 
Will never return.",1,2018,07,19
28,Visiting Friends @ Barcelona,"Very nice experience visiting Barcelona, Hotel very modern and very personable service we enjoyed visit very much!

Breakfast can be a bit crowded at peak hours and staff could be overwhelmed.

Rooms very modern and comfortable, nice gesture at floor 24 and 25 drinks and snacks to chat and relax.

Overall great experience!",4,2018,07,14
28,Lovely hotel,"Arrived at the Level some 11 hours after leaving home in London thanks to the incompetence of easy jet, on the plus side the hotel is amazing we had a lovely view across the city of Barcelona made all the better by the floor to ceiling windows ( not good if your afraid of heights ) the room was spacious and very clean, the shower is large with ample hot water and shower gels etc topped up daily,  beware both the shower and toilet have glass doors which leaves nothing to the imagination to other people in the room, bed was large and very comfortable, there are several bars in the hotel all very nice but quite expensive, the pool area is quite small with a nice bar and very friendly staff be warned they have pool parties at the weekends and you are asked to move off the sun beds which are reserved for the pool party guests at 2:30PM, as hotel guests you are permitted to stay in the pool area although you are only allowed on the sun beds/ sofas away from the pool edge. All the staff in the hotel are extremely helpful and welcoming. We booked on a B&B basis and enjoyed the breakfast which was varied enough for us with enough fresh foods do choice to satisfy even fussy eaters, it seems the hotel is split in two parts one 4 star and one 5 star we stayed in the 5 star and feel it deserves to be a 5 star you have access to all the hotel including the level lounge on floor 25 where you can enjoy a pre dinner drink or two for no charge including alcohol, we loved the location being in a residential area it was a bit quite in the evening but just a five minute stroll takes you to a street with loads of bars and restaurants at a fraction of the price you pay in the Ramblas area. Overall we enjoyed our 4 night stay and would definitely return to this hotel if we visit Barcelona again, just don’t book with easy jet.",5,2018,07,12
28,STAY AWAY,"This hotel is incredibly misleading. It tells you that The Level is a five star hotel but this hotel is NO WHERE NEAR a five star hotel. All the ""extras"" that The Level provided were barely anything to get excited about. We were told we had to pick up our own pillow from downstairs. OUR OWN PILLOW. At a so called ""five star"" hotel. You dont even have to get your own pillow at a motel. The restaurant was always out of dishes and items. The cleaning staff didnt seem to do anything. The location was poor. You could not pay me to stay at this hotel.",1,2018,07,09
28,"Amazing hotel, but not-so-good location","The hotel’s building is spectacular. Our room was in the top floors and the city view is amazing.
The rooms have a really nice and modern design.
The hotel is divided into two sections, being “The Level” the 5 star section (upper floors).
Even though we stayed at The Level, the front desk girl, Hanna, was far from helpful. It took us +10 minutes to check in and over 30 minutes to check out.
The snacks and drinks offered at The Level’s lounge are not that good.
Nevertheless, for breakfast you can have access to an amazing buffet.
Please note that this hotel is pretty far (walking distance) from the major tourist spots in Barcelona (+30 minute walk to La Sagrada Familia)

",4,2018,07,03
28,Ok  not more,"A nice hotel no more than that, certainly not a five star hotel far from all places, a relatively good room and a good and rich breakfast , expansive for whet you get 
Maybe if it’s chipper is was good hotel",3,2018,06,22
28,“Missed” shopping bag,"The hotel location is not the best one, specially because the streets are very different from any gps device I used. The staff is super friendly. The hotel have almost all day free snacks and beverages which is awesome. The breakfast is very good. The views from the hotel are superb. The restaurant is highly recommended, with a good value for money and a beautiful decoration. The room also have a nice and comfy decor and the bathroom amenities are really good. The noise from room to room not so good. The car parking is quite expensive due to the fact it’s not exactly city center. I forgot a shopping bag with its goods inside in my room when I did the checkout. I called several times and emailed to hotel but the stuff just vanished. It’s ridiculous as a big hotel chain like this one you don’t have the access to the people who cleaned the room!!! Kind disappointed.",3,2018,06,19
28,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFULl!!!!!,"What can I say... Myself and my partner arrived on the 9th June till the 11th June and stayed in room no: 2307 to celebrate my birthday. I have stayed in many fine hotels but the service and professionalism of the staff at the Level Melia is (A Star!!!!!) in fact everyone we encountered staff wise was polite and friendly. From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs and offered a glass of Cava then taken to our room which was amazing!!! The level area was FABULOUS for drinks and snacks, we both enjoyed the chocolate cake immensely.. YUMMY!!! Breakfast was fantastic so much choice. I want to say a big thank you especially to Hannah, Xavier, Yolanda and Maria for all their help ie. making reservations for restaurants in the city, sorting out our transfer pick up etc.. nothing was too much for them. A big thank you Melia Barcelona for making my birthday an absolute dream!!!!!!",5,2018,06,13
28,Level at Melia Sky - even better than last time ,"My husband surprised me for my birthday with a return trip here as we enjoyed it so much last time. Love the room with the amazing views across the city to the sea , and the open plan style of the room. The level had changed a little since we had last been there, we felt for the better and I loved that it was now spread across 2 floors . The staff were incredibly attentive and we loved the gorgeous spread for breakfast with those amazing views. There was a private party on the first evening and a music sessions the second evening so we didn’t manage to use the pool but to be honest we weren’t much bothered ! If we come back to this great city we will stay with you again for sure :) ",5,2018,06,10
28,"Omg, what a hotel","Large room which divides so that you can close off the bedroom area.  My only complaint is that the aircon is very lack lustre and doesn’t work well in the bedroom so a bit hot to sleep in.  We did raise it with them but not convinced anything was done.

Wide choice at breakfast which was included in our rate along with the snack hour (tapas) and open bar (limited choice but includes rum, beer, wine, cava) which in fact lasts for 2 hours.",5,2018,06,05
28,Fantastic stay,"We stayed in the LEVEL section great views and service. Staff always at your call  friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the hot breakfast cooked in front of you and served with a smile. Views are terrific, level service the best.Floor 25 staff always there to help with tour tickets and sites. The metro was just a block or so away making it easy to take it to the center in a short time. We can not say anything bad about the hotel or service quite the contrary  it was a pleasure staying there and will be our "" go to hotel"" in the future.We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Miss Hannah at the floor 25 reception she truly made our stay pleasant.
Roland and Alicia Robinson",5,2018,06,03
28,Beautiful Hotel for Exploring Barcelona,"It was our first stay at Melia's The Level and it was a very pleasant surprise for us. The hotel is not very central but quite close to one of the Hop In Hop Off sightseeing bus stops, so ideal for a city break. The Level offered awesome service, great staff, comfortable lounge and spacey family room. So the only downside was an unheated outdoor pool which for early May was too cold. Still highly recommended.",5,2018,05,28
28,I would recommend!,"I know it’s a little to be reviewing but I’ve been busy, but I wanted to take some time out to write about this hotel.

I stayed here with my friends July 2017.
And I had a great experience from start to Finnish, the lounge where you check in is very modern and clean. We was welcomed with a glass of champagne; just what you need after a flight. 
There is drinks, pastries and nibbles through the day that are complementary. 

The hotel itself was lovely, the rooms where spacious and had all the facilities needed. 

The location of the hotel isn’t in the Busiest of areas or where it is all happening but the hotel can arrange taxis and the main strip isn’t too far at all maybe about 10-15 minutes. 

The pool area isn’t huge but it is very nice and great service with very nice food.

Overall - Such a nice hotel. I would recommend and I would also re visit! ",5,2018,05,17
28,"Perfect holiday, perfect stay","when we arrived here they was waiting us with a glass of cava witch made us to feel appreciated and to change our mood on ""holiday time""
all staff is amazing and very proffesional but Yolanda made our stay more than perfect (when we arrived she showed us around what we have included and where we can find everything, and after all of this when we came back in room after one day spent out was waiting us a bottle of cava with chocolate and strawberry)
the room is very clean, big and with modern style and the housekeepers are doing our room 2 times per day.
we had everything in room and very good quality at toiletries.
the breakfast is various and we had from where to choose.
the level is waiting you during the day with snack and soft drinks/wine/cava.
we didn't try the spa or pool but this is a good reason to come back.
i would really recommend to stay on LEVEL, you will not be disappointed. to be honest i don't understand why people witch are complaining about price or services because everything is more than perfect.
For us like a couple was the perfect holiday and we have 4 years together and a lots of places visited.
 Thank you THE LEVEL for everything.",5,2018,05,09
28,Overrated and overpriced,"General impression is good.
However it is clearly not the 5 stars level expected and promised.

The Level service is not worth it.
The choice of food at The level is anecdotal; a few basic pastries, chips, immature fruits and 3 quinoa seeds.
At some points of the day, the buffet is incomplete and you have to request for lemon, sweetener or sodas..... and the answer you can get is..... there is no more....
The same thing applies to the tapas time; the choice is very restricted. It opens late but closes on time. Moreover, being asked for our room number 3 times in 5 minutes did not make us feel very welcome. 

Tea is not refurnished in the room despite our 3 night stay.
One of the sink in the bathroom was clogged during the 3 days.

Breakfast is good but quality of fruit could be improved.

Spa is nice except the fitness area which is tiny.

As a frequent traveller used to other hotel chains within the same price range, Melia, even with The level services, will not be considered as an option for my future stays.

28,'The Level' Junior Executive Suite (top floor) room 2407,"Already done a review, but adding my photos to help show the room. Great size suite with incredible views of the Sagrada Familia. 

You get access to The Level lounge staying on the high floors with complimentary snacks and drinks from 7am-10pm. You get a private check-in at this floor too with a welcome glass of bubbly on arrival.

The bathroom has a big glass window over the bath looking in to bedroom area, but there is a roller blind for privacy and a door. The separate toilet had a frosted glass panel so not very private unless you shut the bathroom, bedroom and lounge doors. Double sinks and rain showers were fabulous and spacious. 

Complimentary water in room. Free safe and Wifi.

Great room for couples.",5,2018,04,16
28,Birthday 3 day Stay ,"We stayed at the level for my husbands 50th birthday and had an amazing stay , we were on the 29th floor and our room had amazing views of the city , the room had a very modern feel to it and we loved the layout and the fact you could see through to the bathroom by way of a huge window , the shower was fab and we had his and hers basins , bathrobes , slippers , the toiletries provided smelled lovely , the level team left balloons in the room and cava and a lovely welcome note as my husband was celebrating his 50th birthday during our stay , room service also delivered another bottle of cava and cake on his actual birthday which was a lovely surprise we checked in with ease at the 25th floor reception area and were welcomed with a chilled glass of cava, the level lounge on the 25th floor had drinks and nibbles between 12pm-10pm with everything from tea/ coffee to soft drinks , beer, wine and of course cava along with fruit, crisps, snacks , sweets ,cakes and amazing views of the city , we loved the terrace bar on the 24th floor where breakfast was served and it was one of the most impressive breakfasts we have had , every kind of food from hot to cold and an open cooking station where you can order omelettes , poached eggs etc , we loved the variety of food to choose from even fresh honey - we had breakfast for 3 mornings and loved everything, the views, the service , the food .

28,Birthday trip,"We were staying at the Level, Melia Barcelona for my daughters 18th birthday treat. The 25th floor reception with complimentary drinks and snacks was excellent and the staff very attentive.   On our first night the pre dinner reception (free alcohol  and tapas) that was held on the 24th floor with views overlooking the city was great. 

Unfortunately, this is where the five star service pretty much finished. Our breakfast on our first morning was not on the 24th floor with panoramic views, it was in the ground floor restaurant ( where the food was ok and totally self service - including teas and coffees). We were also advised that breakfast would be served down here on our second day because the bar on the 24th floor was being refurbished, so access was no longer permitted. In addition, the pre dinner reception was to be held on the 25th floor ( in the lounge/reception where you check in). Breakfast on the second day was even worse - the restaurant was very busy and because we were in the five star area we weren’t supposed to get our own drinks ( however it took ages to be served) and when they finally realised we were there, and had helped ourselves to food, we were offered a selection of eggs cooked to order ( which would have been great if we hadn’t already helped ourselves to the buffet - including inedible cold scrambled eggs. 

Sounds like we hated it. We didn’t.  I don’t think it was a five star experience but a really competent four star hotel. Breakfast was disappointing and I wish they had let us know before hand that there would be renovation work taking place, so we could have made a decision as to whether to change venue or not. However, The room was very pleasant, the staff was very helpful and their English impeccable.",4,2018,04,06
28,Fantastic Hotel ,"We have just returned from our stay at this hotel. From the moment we arrived we enjoyed every minute of our stay.The check in service on 25th floor with welcome glass if Cava is a great introduction. 
We sampled the spa for massages and loved it. With it being my wife's birthday the hotel sent a complimentary  cake and bottle of chilled bubbly upto our room.My wife was delighted with this personal touch. 
The private lounge and bar areas are great for relaxing and enjoying the panoramic views of the wonderful city.
Breakfast offer was very varied and set us up for our days of visiting the numerous attractions.
This is a genuine  5 star hotel in a good location for both beach and city centre.We will definitely be returning. ",5,2018,04,05
28,Stunning hospitality and facilities,"From the offer of a welcome drink at the 25th floor reception, the atmosphere was immediately cordial after travelling. After taking some snacks at the lounge with a view over Gaudi's Cathedral Sagrada Familia, my bags were taken to the room. 

Rooms have lovely views over the city of Barcelona; inside the modern slick room with wall to wall curtain there is a soft and welcoming bed, funky chaise longue sofa, ambient red corner light, a good desk and chair to work at, power sockets in the right places. Slightly odd metal freestanding post for your room card made me think 'slightly spaceship'. The bathroom is separated by a glass panel, there is a walk in shower, and a couple of robes & slippers in the red shelved open wardrobe.

Heading down to the small gym, the facilities are enough to get the blood pumping. After that you can relax in their steam room, sauna and jacuzzi pool. There are three chill out couches for relaxing after. 

Unfortunately I didn't get to check out the bar or restaurant, but enjoyed a couple of 2 hour sleeps here and there amongst a busy schedule.",5,2018,04,02
28,Great Hotel for a City Trip,"Our stay at the hotel was really a memorable and pleasant one: with its great connection to public transport (roughly a 5-10 min walk to the Poblenou Metro station, and 3-4 mins to the next Tram station) this hotel is the ideal base for a city trip. Also the beach is located in walking-distance, which gives you the best of both sides - sightseeing and relaxing. Yet, despite its great location it is still far enough removed from the overcrowded tourist hotspots in town, so that you can return to a quiet haven in the evening after a day out in the city. 

The interior is kept very modern, and has a luxurious feel to it. From the moment you enter the ground floor hallway, you feel welcome and pampered, and can relax in the beautiful, quiet and sensuous atmosphere (soft music, dimmed lights, and soothing fragrances in the air). This becomes even more evident as soon as you leave the elevator on the 25th floor to check in at the closed-off 'The Level'-lounge, where you're welcomed with a glass of chilled champagne (or softdrink) by one of the friendly members of staff. 

The rooms of 'The Level' are located on the top floors of the hotel, and are furnished in a modern and sophisticated way, without seeming spartan. They come with walk-in showers, high-end quality beds/ mattresses/ pillows, and floor-level windows which offer amazing vistas either over the city (also the Sagrada Familia) or the ocean. Also, they're equipped with a Nespresso-machine and free coffee capsules, which are re-stocked daily.

Among the amenities of 'The Level' is also a closed-off snack-bar, which offers complementary cold and hot drinks as well as snacks throughout the day, a complimentary tapas-hours from 7 pm in the 'Dos Cielos'-restaurant on the 24th floor, which provides an assortment of hot & cold tapas and drinks (champagne, gin, vodka, beer, soft-drinks, and many more) with lovely views of the sea, free access to the superb spa area with jacuzzi, as well as breakfast in the 'Dos Cielos'-restaurant (for this, the restaurants is closed off to the other guests, so that you can enjoy breakfast in front of the sunrise over the ocean in an intimate atmosphere). 

Also the staff of the hotel (particularly reception & concierge) go out of their way to fulfil whatever wish you may have, and are always ready to assist you in any way possible, and are friendly above and beyond what can be expected!

The only negative thing which we noticed during the whole of our stay was the staff in the 'Dos Cielos'-bar during the afternoons/evenings: much in contrast to the other members of staff, who are the personification of kindness and professionalism, the general attitude here was much more reserved (not to say condescending and arrogant), and also the service was in no way comparable to the rest of the hotel. Just to give one example: on our last evening at the hotel we went to have cocktails, and after being ignored for 45 minutes, we left without having even ordered. Also, during the time we waited to be served, one waiter dropped a tray of wine glasses right next to us; now, while that isn't a problem at all - accidents do happen - his reaction was: instead of apologising for the mishap and for getting splashes of wine on us (and other guests), he cursed, turned around, and went back to the bar, so that we were left with broken glasses and puddles of wine on the floor. This was really a shame, as this experience fell so far behind the standards which the rest of the hotel set. I can only imagine that this is not the usual treatment guests receive there, and that they were either tight on staff or that the waiter was new to the job, as this in no way matched the (excellent!!!) impressions we got in other areas of the hotel, or even in 'Dos Cielos' during other times of the day. But as this was literally the only setback during the whole of our stay, I would still highly recommend staying at this hotel. I would also like to extend a hearty ""Thank you!"" to the hotel for making us feel so welcome and pampered!",5,2018,03,31
28,"Nearly everything was excellent, however the staff at breakfast were poor","When you arrive at the hotel, you go up to the 25th floor for the reception. At reception you are offered a seat and drink. The room was on the 23rd floor and had a good view of the city (you can pay an extra 30 euros for a sea view). The room was modern with a king sized bed and plenty of electric sockets. There was no USB connections next to the bed. The bathroom was a little small and didn't have a suitably placed mirror. However the shower was very good and there were bathrobes and slippers. The wifi was easy to connect to and reliable. The room was dark and quiet enabling a good nights sleep.
As a guest of the hotel you have access to the lounge, where you get free drinks and food. The food is basic food for most of the day, but a lot more is put out for 7pm. The lounge has comfy chairs and a nice ambience with nice views over the city. The breakfast rooms are on the 24th floor, there is a sea view or city view. There is a wide choice of foods including fresh fruits, yoghurts pastries, cakes and hot foods. However the staff were slow and not very responsive. We asked twice for hot tea and eventually gave up waiting. We had very good service from Diogo and want to specifically name him for doing a fantastic job (all the staff on reception and in the lounge were good).
It is about a 25 minute walk to the Sagrada, 50 minutes to Las Ramblas and 5-10 minutes to the metro.",4,2018,03,23
28,"Amazing hotel & service, you won't regret booking this hotel","Just got back two days ago ( March 18-20th ), travelled as a couple for a mini break.

We arrived outside the hotel via taxi which took 20-25 minutes ( oh that cost us 41 euros from airport to hotel , there was extra charge as we arrived on a Sunday, return on a weekday was £35 euros) and was welcomed outside the hotel and our luggage taken from us, inside we were then taken to the lifts to go upstairs to level 25 to be checked in, as the reception on ground floor is for the 4 star hotel. We walked out of the lift and turn the corner in to a lovely calming are with two reception desks, to the left a reading /lounge area and to the right an area for refreshments such as tea, coffee, soft drinks and wine ( red, white, rose) and a selection of food to nibble away on whilst taking in the amazing views of Barcelona and the hill tops. We were given a warm welcome and invited to sit when checking in and offered a glass of wine or water. We had arrived early and our room wasn't ready, not really a big problem we got a ticket  for our luggage and off went went not to waste any time as we were only there for 3 days/2 nights. We found our way to the beach area. Took us longer than normally now to my mobility as it slows me down, but I reckon normal speed walking probably 10 minutes away.  The beach is lovely and the sun was out and so the beach had a busy but calming atmosphere with volleyball, ball games, people sitting on the beach, people sitting along the many benches just watching others and the sea, with the odd plane out at sea coming into land. Lots of people walking dogs, on  roller skates and cycles it really seems an active place along the sea front. There was a few restaurants along the beach front but we walked to the little harbour and sat in the sun and had a drink and bite to eat as here there was plenty of food outlets.  We strolled back to hotel and sampled some of the nibbles and enjoyed a few glasses of wine taking in the view at a window seat as our room was ready our luggage was taken to our room for us.
 
Our room: Room 2305, floor 23. This room is an interconnecting room.  Card entry and on entering we were wow'd. To the left was Nespresso coffee machine, capsules, kettle, cups, mini bar -- the mini bar is chargeable --  there was a clothes hanging area and automatic rail light when you walked passed, draws and shelving. A free safe to use. Shoe buffer/cleaner accessories. Next was a huge walk in shower with over head shower head or choice of a normal spray , though no hook on the wall for this to sit in so you had to hold it to use. Personally as I have longish hair I didn't want wet hair by using the over head head and there was no shower caps to use. The toilet area had a sliding glass door that didn't quite reach across , the glass had blocked out area in the middle for privacy. Heated towel rail, more shelving and bin. Then there is a huge window looking into the room and you can see the amazing view outside from here, there were two basins and swing out mirror ( behind the mirror were electric sockets, tissue box, hotel toiletries and a moveable little mirror. Two dressing gowns and two pairs of slippers in a little bag, oh and for a nice change there is a proper hair dryer. that was lovely and powerful. Towels were white and very soft. Fixed mirror behind the main door into the room. Walking into the main bedroom there is a huge tv on the wall, a wow of a view over Barcelona and hill tops --sun sets this side and let me tell you it was beautiful and late at night with all the lights of the city was stunning. ---  The bed was huge with plenty of sockets for charging, light switches and reading light. Telephone for reception. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and I slept so well. They have a turn down service in the evening.

Breakfast is on floor 24. Again as you'd expect for being up high , stunning views this time looking over Barcelona and the sea. Choose of sitting to enjoy in here of sofas and tables, chairs and tables, this is also the evening bar area. But back to breakfast : The choice of food is vast in the separate area as they show cook in here too. You have your meats, cheeses, hone from a honeycomb, cereals, boiled eggs, range of different breads to toast, fruit, huge range of pastries, then in hot servers : bacon, potatoes,scrambled egg, beans, chicken sausages and more. There is something for everyone. Your are served fresh orange juice and coffee/tea and on each table is a selection of the famous Tiptree jams to enjoy ( lovely to see as we live about 10 miles away from Tiptree jam so we know the quality) . Staff were friendly and we were often asked if we wanted more orange/coffee/tea, So relaxing to sit here. The first morning the sun was beaming through and really warmed up the area, as they have covered over the ceiling area that most come off during the summer months. The second morning they had the heaters on and it was lovely warm and gave a nice atmosphere too. This area has a bar for the evening to use and they had the heaters on then too. 

Floor 6, has the decking area and sitting area and an outside pool. The hotel also has a spa area too and treatments - payable.

We loved the area of the hotel, not right in the heart of the city, but in a quieter area. The hotel is immaculately clean, very comfortable and has staff make this place. We must say a very big thank you to Yolanda Beitane- this young lady is the best! So friendly and extremely helpful. She booked our hop -on-off-bus passes, tickets to Sagrada Familia and recommended us a restaurant to eat in the evening, which was so good she booked us in again for our second night , this restaurant was called Raco De La Villa. You can't beat the staff here,  so friendly and their English was very good.

To help enjoy your Barcelona trip :  The hop on hop off buses run near by , about a 10 minute walk and this is one the Green route, You can swap routes and get on the Orange route too. So you can really get around and see the city in your own time this way.

Taxis are plenty full and can seen seen easily as they are black a yellow.   There's a tram line not far from the hotel and there's also the metro trains - can't comment on tram or metro as we never used them. 

Our time in Barcelona was short and flew by. We had a lovely time and I truly enjoyed my birthday treat from my hubby. I didn't want to leave. I can't recommend this hotel high enough. Though if I could make two changes it'd be  free bottle of water for the room, so I could of made a cup of tea, as water was in the coffee machine already for us, ( yes, I know there's water in the selection in the mini bar be expensive) and a shower cap .

Thanks The Level at Sky Barcelona for a fabulous stay and a massive thank you to Yolanda, you're a little star and help us with our bookings for trips and restaurant in the evenings , Raco de la villa is a hidden gem we'd not of found without you. Thank you also for my little Melia biscuit, it was yummy :)  If we visit Barcelona again, I will not hesitate to book to stay here again.",5,2018,03,23
28,Superb experience,"The Level at Melia Sky offers an elegant, affordable experience in a great location. Rooms are well-designed and modern, although small. Bed and bedding were great. The sea views are terrific and it's only a 15 minute walk from the hotel to the beach.

The best part about the stay is The Level. The morning breakfast is top notch, truly amazing. It features great variety with top quality, fresh fruits, breads, pastries, cereal, meats, cheeses, and made-to-order waffles and omelets. In the afternoons the Level is a perfect spot for quiet working or relaxing with snacks and drinks. The service is great, top-notch overall. 

I certainly recommend this hotel for business travel or vacation stay in the beautiful city of Barcelona.",5,2018,03,21
28,Great Hotel and Service,"The hotel is located in Poblenou a nice Area with walking distance Mall. The Level is an upper category from Melia and they treat you very well during the entire stay. The staff is always smiling and a great attitude, The rooms are very comfortable and wit a beautiful view to the city and the ocean. Overall is a Hotel that I recommend and expect to stay there again. Thank you very much to Antonio at the 24th floor (The restaurant) who was always very nice to us and everyone. Excellent Hotel.",5,2018,03,19
28,Very enjoyable stay at Melia,"Stayed here for 3 nights last July with my friend. 

We had been Barcelona last year and had wanted to go a bit more luxury this time around so picked the The Level at Melia. 

Really enjoyed staying here from the lovely champagne welcome at check in to the friendly good bye on check out.

As I had visited quite a while ago I cant remember every detail of my stay, however what stood out to me was the following:

Room- view from the top floors are absolutely amazing overlooking the city. Room was really clean and tidy. The bathroom has a glass window which I didn't mind but I guess it depends how comfortable you are with who you are sharing the room with. 

Pool/spa- Pool spa area was lovely the large sheltered beds by the pool are so comfy that I had fallen asleep on it whilst it was raining! Theres also sauna/steam room and thermal pool (which was the perfect temperature). Cocktails served by the pool bar staff were great.

Food- We had breakfast buffet at the level restaurant for the first two days which served nice hot food including omelettes with ingredients of your choice. On the last day I had asked to use the main restaurant for breakfast and to be honest the variety was much better here than breakfast served at The Level. We were out all day so didn't manage to eat any lunch or dinner so cant comment on this. 

Staff- I have stayed at a number of hotels and I must say the staff at Melia really stood out to me. From checkin in to when we left all the staff we interacted with including the check-in staff at the Level, those at reception, the pool bar staff, chefs at breakfast and the cleaners were all so friendly and were happy to help us with any issue that we had. 

All in all this was a wonderful stay at a hotel with its lovely amenities, hospitable staff and general good vibe. I am planning to visit Barcelona again this year and I will defiantly be booking a room at Melia.",4,2018,03,15
28,Very enjoyable break,Was in Barcelona on business but have this hotel to return to meant the stay was very enjoyable. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Would love to return when it's a little warmer to make use of the pool and the sky bar.,5,2018,03,05
28,Everything I expected from Melia!,"Staying in such a beautiful hotel is the cherry on top whilst visiting Barcelona. The Level really does have an exclusive feel as soon as you are welcomed. 

The first element of this hotel that stuns you is the architecture - it is a contemporary beauty! 

Treating yourself to The Level is exactly that (a treat!) and in turn you are really given the VIP experience. Cava on arrival? Another glass... yes please! 

Service was impeccable (which is standard for Melia) no request was too much to ask. 

The room was beautifully styled and immaculate with a great view of the city. As well as usual included in a turn down service, staff go the extra mile and even fold untidy clothes. Perfect for those of us who throw everything down in excitement when we finally arrive!

The all inclusive breakfast is a feast offering every option from Spanish to English to Chinese ...and of course cava.

Complimentary cava, spirits and tasty nibbles throughout the day,just for those staying in The Level, adds to the VIP feel of this hotel.
",5,2018,02,15
28,Remarkable place to stay!,"The view is amazing and the service by the staff at the Level reception desk is remarkable!  We truly enjoy our stay at the Level since the location is pretty quiet (Poblenou area) but it has easy access to downtown Barcelona. We also enjoyed the breakfast at the coffee shop at ground floor with so many good selection, especially churros dipped in thick hot cocoa! Simply divine!",5,2018,02,13
28,Super service!!,"My wife and I are so satisfied with the excellent service by The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky staffs at their 25th Floor Reception Lounge! They are incredibly helpful and attentive to us. They even surprised my wife with a flower arrangement and chocolates for our loving vacation. We stayed at one of their Junior Suites the 21st floor, and the room is very clean and comfortable. The view towards the beach is simply breathtaking! In short, we will come back again for sure!  Next year we will bring our children along. Thank you so much The Level Melia Barcelona Sky!!!",5,2018,02,13
28,Anniversary ,"Currently  staying in the Level for a long weekend. We visited last year and loved it but this time we wanted to experience the Level as it’s our 25th anniversary and so opted to book here and one word WOW.
I visit many hotels due to work and can honestly say this is definitely the best one we have stayed at in Barcelona and I include the W in that. The staff are all very professional but friendly and the rooms  extremely clean with fantastic views over either the city or towards the sea. We visited Dos Celios their Michelin starred restaurant last time which is also worth a visit. Sadly couldn’t get a table this time as I left it too late to book.
Thank you for making our anniversary trip so special.",5,2018,02,02
28,Excellent ,"My wife and I went to have a couple of nights of relaxation and tranquillity. The crew of the hotel has been extraordinary both days. Cleaned room, comfortable bed, nice views and with all the amenities replaced twice a day. They just forgotten some nespresso capsules that were sent straight away, and the guest manager did a follow up on the matter (just for few capsules, which was nice at them!)
The breakfast buffet is quite complete with different type of foods: local, oriental and fruits, it may sound silly but the scrambled eggs were delicious, which is not common on such buffets.
The service, the crew, the Level lounge and the snacks from 7 to 9pm were also very nice. We enjoyed our stay
The hotel is located 15-20’ walking to the see, I recommend to walk down Rambla Poblenou, with bars and small shops, it’s a beautiful area of the city, not too crowded.
Fully recommended

28,"Peaceful, Lovely and Friendly Retreat","We, were vacationing in Catalonia during the seasonal holiday of the new year. The Level at Melia sky has been improved considerably compared to what has been in 2015. Rooms are refurbished and the level lounge on the 25th floor reflects the art and science of understanding people's needs to create functional space that provide relaxing environment overlooking Barcelona city. On the 24th floor there is another retreat, a wonderful glass house bar overlooking the city, and sometimes breakfast was served there under the beautiful winter warm sunshine, we were amazed.  With regard to the happy hours, drinks and snacks were served evening between 7 to 9 pm on the ground floor and not on the 25th floor. 

The hotel is located away from the Plaça de Catalunya and it is about €10 euros by taxi. However, there are many restaurants with reasonable prices located on Rambla del Poblenou nearby the hotel serving wonderful Catalonian dishes, tapas, Mediterranean, Italian dishes you name it.

We stayed in a junior suite that has a separated bedroom with all the amenities that made our stay an enjoyable one. The maids ensured that our room was immaculate on daily basis many thanks to all of them.

Recipients and other personnel in the lobby were extremely friendly with smiling face that all were responsive to our questions and helpful. Also, the people at the breakfast and evening snacks are all very friendly kind and attentative, big thanks to all of them.

With regard to the breakfast and the evening snacks, it is more delightful to serve it on the 25th floor rather than on the ground floor. We hope the management would consider this suggestion.

Barcelona is a peaceful city wonderful with its friendly people, amazing food, lovely sunny warm beach even in winter. In future, yes, we will definitely come back to Barcelona city and will stay at the Level at Melia Sky.",4,2018,01,05
28,The devil is in the details,"Let's be clear, this is a 5 star hotel that charge 200 euros per night. That means that the expectations are higher. In a hotel that makes less promises, I wouldn't have noticed these details.
The special reception was extremely slow. They only have one person in charge, so it would be faster to check in downstairs in the ""normal"" reception that has more staff. Some people mentioned that they offer a drink while you wait...well, drinks are on a table, but nobody offers them, so useless. 
We were assigned a room in the 14th floor (I thought The Level was only the higher floors, well no). On the hotel website they announce the rooms have a Nespresso machine. Well, no nespresso machine in the room (I actually doubted if they really gave us a The Level room. I still have the question). We only founded a water boiler...that was useless because there was no tea in the room. We opened the minibar...to find some left overs from the previous guest! 
Then we looked for the mini bar price list, that according to the book in the room should be available. Well, no, missing in action.
We decided to forget about that and take a shower. The design of the shower cabin is terrible and after some minutes the toilet area was flooded. We needed to dry the floor with towels to be able to walk around. The kind of activity that you enjoy to do in a 5 star hotel.
The carpet outside the room wasn't vacuumed.
When we decided to check out, we went all the way up to the 25th just to find out the famous special reception only opens at 12. Good thing after all, because the ""normal"" reception was very efficient and nice.
Location wise is not great, it is necessary to take a taxi to go to the city center (around 10 euros), and it takes around 20 minutes walking to reach the beach.
The room is nice, with big windows, good breakfast.
They have a lot to improve!",3,2018,01,02
28,Great location and great views..,"This hotel is in a great location. Not to far from the centre or the beach... both destinations can  be walked to in about 15 mins... also new developments nearby is making the area quite trendy...   it takes around an  hour to get to the hotel from the airport on public transport and requires a few changes..

The hotel is great..  Having breakfast on the top floor with views over the city is a must.. but you will only be able to have it there, if you play extra for the level...

28,Excellent location and hotel will go back for sure,"Booked a 3 night couples break for our Anniversary. We booked a room in The Level which are their 5* rooms on the top floors with their own private check-in area. Fabulous welcome on our arrival which was a Sunday early evening and presented with a glass of bubbly and some sweets which was very nice after the journey.

We took a taxi from airport as much faster and simpler than trying to work out trains and buses when you don't know the area. €25 booked in advance and taxi driver waiting for us in arrivals area.

Our Suite (Room 2407) Junior Executive Suite (50m2) on the top floor had views over the city and a view of the Sagrada Familia which was a lovely surprise. We could not fault the room with a separate lounge area and 'his and hers' sinks and rain showers!! Even separate wardrobes with a light and just enough space. The bedroom had a window in to the bathroom so when sat in the bath you could either watch TV or see the sky line. There was a roller blind for privacy!

The breakfast room had incredible views of the sea and nice and quiet as only for The Level guests. Great choice at breakfast and they can make you fresh omelette or poached eggs. Sets you up nicely for a long day sightseeing.

'The Level' guests have exclusive access to 'Executive Lounge' where you can get  Complimentary drinks/snacks throughout the day until 10pm. They had Prosecco and wines available aswell as soft drinks and snacks. Views of the Barcelona skyline.

Hairdryers, slippers, robes and lovely toiletries and a safe, surround sound and flat-screen TVs in the lounge and bedroom. Nespresso coffee maker and fridge.

There was a restaurant on the upper floor but was £105 per person we didn't use this as we much preferred to go out and find a nice tapas bar to chill and half the price as just as good. There was a cocktail bar in this floor too and we did have a lovely drink in there before going out. £15€ a cocktail but was very nice. 

The hop on hop off bus is well worth purchasing as you can get about so easily with this and you just put your ticket in the machine when you get on. 

Well worth booking a tour of the Sagrada Familia as you beat the queues. You are given ear phones to wear as your guide tells you about the place as you are shown about. Lots of security about which was to be expected but it felt safe and they did take a little longer to get is as there were bags checks. 

The Las Ramblas shopping was great and plenty of places to enjoy a drink and tapas.

The Gotic quarter had a lovely opening with bars and music and felt like we were in the heart of the city with the atmosphere. Great G&T served! 

Would highly recommend a visit to Barcelona and especially this hotel.

",5,2017,11,16
28,Great Experience.,"You have to consider a little extra to be a the Level, bus the experience is fantastic. Probably the best breakfast ever and the best view from Barcelona. Service is magnificent, you can experience a mix of cultures and a great coffee at the same time. The Hotel is really well located, staff really cares about you to have a Great Experience there.",5,2017,11,07
28,Excellent hotel experience,"Really enjoyed my recent visit to this hotel to celebrate my friend’s birthday. Excellent room on the 27th floor with view of Sagrada Família which was unexpected. 

Had mentioned it was a special occasion and a cake and cava sent to our room which was a nice touch. 

The Level staff were excellent and helpful. The level room itself could have benefited from a wider variety of (hot) snacks but overall a pleasant experience. 

The hotel is a little way out from the centre but tram, tube and taxis available at reasonable cost. 

I’d recommend this for a luxury experience in a great city. ",5,2017,11,04
28,The level,"When we arrived in sky level melia Barcelona, we told our surname in the reception in the ground then told us we have to go to the 25th floor level lounge  for a private checking we are worried, but the level lounge  are beautiful in the highest floor with a glass of cava during check in overlooking the views of the city , breakfast fantastic and amazing .the room was huge with rain showers . I only mention this when I book the hotel I left a message that we are celebrating our anniversary but no mention or any words anyway it is a amazing experience we stay, we love so much Barcelona and we would like to go back again the sky level hotel just take me a long time to give feedback but as they say never too late . Thanks Angie",5,2017,10,29
28,Thought it was wonderful and worth 5 *BUT......,"We have just had 3 days at this wonderful hotel. We arrived at 11am and went to our exclusive check in level where we had Cava whilst we waited to check in. We upgraded to a sea view plus bath which was wonderful. There was a strange smell in the room but sometimes Spain can be a little wiffy but usually in the height of summer not October.
After walking and eating we went back to hotel in time for snacks and free open bar. (7-9 pm) went to bed around 10 and still a big of a pong in the room. Unfortunately we kept waking up because of the smell.
We reported it the following day and also that the sink was extremely slow to drain. We thought this may be the problem. When we got back that evening the smell was there faintly. Today we have boarded cruise line and all our clothes smell must and yummy. This hotel is first class, a little far out but I will not stay here again because of the Smell.....",1,2017,10,16
28,Night spent in suite on the level,"We decided to treat ourselves to a night in the suite on the level.

Mixed feelings on the value for money but the room was large and spacious. You get exclusive check in on the 25th floor, the staff whilst professional wasn't overly friendly.

The room was clean and had the usual amenities. Odd design with the toilet feeling like it was in the hallway.

Got access to the lounge which provides soft drinks, wine and food throughout the day and spirits from 7-9pm in the bar downstairs.

The breakfast on the 24th floor boasted amazing views over Barcelona which was a nice way to wake up. The breakfast buffet was on the smaller size but did have a chef making eggs to your liking. 

Location, it's not in the middle of the tourist area which is the way we liked it. We walked to the Picasso Museum and it took just over 30 minutes.

We have stayed in nicer hotels for the same price which is why I say I'm in two minds about value for money. With the lounge it is an added bonus but I think the website shows a most more luxurious view of the room to actual.",4,2017,10,15
28,"Nice hotel, but over-priced","Stayed with my boyfriend for 5 nights in September 2017. We paid more than budgeted after seeing The Level online and thought it looked great.

The biggest issue with the hotel is the reception. Upon arrival, we were directed to the 25th floor for a more 'exclusive' check in. There are only 2 desks on the 25th floor and a lot of the time only one of these is staffed. Whilst we were the only ones to arrive at that time (around 9pm on a Friday) and were seen immediately, the family who arrived just after us had to wait for the length of our check-in (around 5 minutes) to be seen. Whilst this was made slightly better by the offer of a glass of cava on arrival, it was quite a wait. Also, this meant that throughout our stay, whenever we wanted to speak to someone, there was often a queue to wait to see someone. We were informed that we could also use the main reception on the ground floor; however, this somewhat takes away from the 'exclusive' experience. 

The Level lounge is good- wine, cava, hot drinks, soft drinks and snacks available all day; however no beer or spirits are available- which I have seen in other executive lounges. You can only get these between 7-9 on the ground floor.

The staff- once you were able to talk to them- were great. Very approachable and knowledgeable. The cleaning staff were very friendly too, and a housekeeping service is done twice per day, which is great.

The pool is great and so are the bar areas. The pool is on the small side, but this wasn't an issue during our stay and we were able to get sun loungers whenever we wished. 

The rooms are comfortable and clean- the bed is particularly comfy and you get a great choice of pillows. Huge TV too. Not as luxurious as they look online

However, overall, I have to say it wasn't worth the very expensive price we paid (mainly due to reception experience not being 5* and room not particularly luxurious for 5*) and unfortunately I would pick elsewhere if we were to return to Barcelona.",3,2017,10,09
28,Great weekend with friends,"Great location. Second stay at The Level Melia Sky Hotel. The hotel didn't disappoint - only that the room was on the small side and bathroom not very private - would be ok if you were sharing with your partner but the lack of privacy made it 'awkward' at times... just as well we were 'good' friends! If I were to stay here again with a 'friend' I shall request a bigger room with a bathroom that has more privacy.
The hotel is clean and staff are polite and accommodating.",4,2017,10,04
28,Just so so,We went for a birthday trip and were very pleased the first day. After that it’s all been down hill. We are still here ....waiting on house keeping for towels and toilet paper since they never replaced. For a 5 star the small things have been over looked. No WiFi one night and nothing was done about it. We asked about hiking at the concierge desk and were given basically no information. We found it on our own. Very disappointing especially for the price and previous reviews. Hesitant to come back. ,2,2017,09,29
28,A nice modern hotel that isn't too fancy.,"Although not bang in centre, this is a really nice hotel in Barcelona. The hotel was comfortable, the staff looked after us well and it wasn't a big problem to get to the centre - but it is a long walk.",5,2017,09,29
28,Great experience,"Here on a short trip to barcelona, the level is essentially similar to executive rooms at major hilton hotels. The rooms are excellent, breakfast fantastic and staff superb. It is a bit of a distance to the main sites, but if you don't mind a longish 1 hour walk, it can be very illuminating",5,2017,09,19
28,Wonderful experience with fantastic staff,"I had a fantastic stay at The Level at this hotel for a week. The views of the city and of the ocean are amazing, and the rooms were comfortable and very modern in color and decor. Everyone on staff from the concierge, check-in, chefs, servers, room service and maintenance were wonderful.

I had an issue in my room with the air conditioner not working and within about five minutes a maintenance man had come to fix the problem resulting in cool air once again.

The concierge staff helped me immensely with planning some excursions, getting directions, and navigating my way around the city by metro. Believe me, it was a huge help! They also printed out a lot of information for me to review and were available whenever I had additional questions. 

The breakfasts', as has been mentioned in other reviews, was fabulous; I looked forward to it every day and still dream about it.  But for me my favorite thing was the housemade pumpkin and ginger marmalade on artisan bread. I loved it so much I was allowed to take home the recipe and a nice sample.  I hope I'll be able to reproduce it faithfully and make the chef proud. Thank you Bruno and chef! The hostesses and servers who always warmly greeted every morning me we're also wonderful and pleasant to chat with as was the service I experienced.

I was also fortunate to experience a 10 course meal in Its Michelin star restaurant.  It was beautifully decorated and lit for the evening meal which was also fabulous.  Each course was different and yet very tasty. The flavors and textures were all so different yet cohesive. It was very much ""food as art."" and I would say that the dessert was probably the most complex of the combination of tastes and textures.",5,2017,09,18
28,The Level at melia Barcelona Sky but no level at all!,"When I choose the level at Melia Sky I was hoping to feel like VIP gust, but there is no level at all! On my check-out I was disappointed and frustrated since this was the worst stay at any Melia hotel.
Negative side: all the furniture in the room look old and ""tired"". Dust is everywhere from the telephone till the table and TV. Never cleaned during my stay!!! If you put a card on the bed in the morning asking for change the bed sheets, only pillow sheets were changed but not the rest bed sheets.?'!! I asked for new towels and replacement of the coffee cartridge for Nessperso cafe maker since I drank all coffee the day before....three ours later still no towels...you need to go to front office desk to asks at least twice...and after 10 hours you get only towels and NEVER coffee. I got coffee the next day!!??? What a level at the Level in Melia!!!! And shower cabin is unbelievable small if you manage to enter since the door is closed to toilet id you can not open it as much as you need.
Positive side:Breakfast is great! Excellent choice of many food station such raw salmon, Spanish classic crude ham and sausages ( fried chorizo), Chinese dumplings and if you want you can have a glass of Cava ( Champagne). Breakfast venue is on 24th floor just for the level guest, so view is amazing- you can see Barcelona beneath you. WiFi is free! Nice and cosy swimming pool.",3,2017,09,17
28,A great mini break,"The service at the Level is brilliant, nothing is too much trouble, the Level team go out of their way to make sure your stay is the best!
The beds are comfy and clean, housekeeping were on the ball.
Breakfast in the sky lounge was amazing,so much choice and beautiful views.
The complementary drinks and snacks in the level lounge and downstairs between 7-9 pm were lovely.
Anna downstairs in the Merkado restaurant is so helpful, and Gabriella in the Sky Lounge at breakfast is so cheerful and welcoming.
Would stay here again definitely 👍🏻😊",5,2017,09,07
28,Excellent Hotel,"This is an excellent Hotel on the top of the tower of Melia Hotel. Very modern and stylish rooms. A great view to the sea or to the city. We appreciat the high quality of the service, very professional, everything was excellent. The breakfast on the terrace was fabulous with a great sea view. Excellent quality of food.",5,2017,08,30
28,Average,"It was a nice hotel.. unfortunately for us they had maintanance work going on... so hotel didn't look it's best. Plus there was a weird smell in the corridors with wires dangling (not 100% safe).

But overall the hotel was pleasant.. clean room. 
We was lucky to have a fabulous view outside our window.. Beautiful scenery whilst the night lights are lit. 
The hotel is a short distance from the metro, it's located near the local residential area so the convenience stores are easily accessible.

Overall a good hotel with lovely welcoming staff 😊",4,2017,08,29
28,"Amazing, lush and luxury hotel - in love!","Don't stay at this hotel if you don't want to sit at breakfast crying at the fact you have to leave and return back home. One of the most amazing hotel's i've ever stayed in and gutted to be back home because it made my experience in Barcelona an amazing 11/10. 
Went to Barcelona for the first time over the BH weekend for three nights, four days (Friday - Monday) and got asked if we wanted to be upgraded to The Level for €180 - so basically €90 each (went as a couple) and was so worth it! Breakfast on the 25th floor, champagne, wine, beer and appetisers available in their different lounges all throughout the day which is great and the room was stunning. Large Bedroom with a huge bed and an amazing bathroom with a ""His and Hers"" sink and a walk in shower as well as a bath tub. The pool is lovely too, with amazing food to eat poolside, beautiful cocktails and a lovely pool with music playing (but not too loud) and there are sun loungers available which makes a change as theyre usually always taken up.
The decor, the service, the hotel is amazing. Location - I was worried about it being a bit further out from the main strips, Las Ramblas, The W Hotel but its around a 10-15 minute taxi journey and in all honestly i preferred it because you drive past some beautiful views in Barca so for me personally the taxi rides and sites we saw just added to my experience. Its also nice to be in an area thats peaceful, adds to the luxury of it. Theres a petrol station next door too which is very handy if you need to get anything from the shop. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone but especially couples because I had the best time here and I've stayed at a fair share of luxury hotels in London, Dubai and Miami but this was genuinely the best experience I've ever had and the hotel played a huge part of that. 
I love Barcelona, and The Level at Melia Sky. Will I be returning again? Already planning my next trip for next month!",5,2017,08,29
28,Not up to the normal Melia standard,"I dont usually leave a review whilst still staying at a hotel, but after being told that I couldnt take my 20 euro cocktail to my 350 euro a night executive suite room tonight I feel that it is fair to give some immediate feed back!

As other reviewers have said, this is a hotel of 2 parts. The upper floors are designated the level - a concierge experience that some describe inaccurately as 5 star the lower floors are 3 to 4 star - my comments relate to the level

Ive stayed at a number of Melia properties - they are my first choice whilst staying in Spain. This hotel has been the most disappointing of them all. Firstly the positives - stunning views, an interesting location - great for local Barcelona feel, but just a short cab journey from the tourist sites. Some staff members, particularly the level concierge excellent. A cool urban feel particularly around the pool.

Now for the negatives - started from the moment we walked in. At 350 euros a night I expect a doorman.... No - walked into the hotel lobby, carrying our own luggage - had to ask where the level check in was - called our own lift - eventually found the check in area. Given the keys to our executive suite and found our own way there carrying our luggage. Stank of cigarette smoke, went back and complained - staff seemed to expect the complaint, then got moved.

The room is spacious but ultimately plainly furnished, not what I would consider five star standard. The bed is not attached to the headboard, and dosnt have locks on the casters, so if you sit up in bed it rolls away from the wall. 2 tvs without instructions, that if you try hard enough you can get an english news channel but thats about it.

One of the 2 sinks in the bathroom didnt drain - raised the issue with housekeeping staff member - was told I should ring reception. Room hadnt been serviced at 2pm, spoke to housekeeping manager on our floor. By 4.30pm still hadnt been serviced. Eventually when it had been, toilet rolls hadnt been refreshed, bins were un emptied, the only thing that appeared to have changed was that the bed had been poorly made.

1111111Service at the pool was patchy - appeared to be too few staff which appears to be fundamental problem with the hotel - in general poorly motivated staff - (with a few notable exceptions) and therefore presumably poor management and leadership - sadly I wouldnt recommend this hotel as an example of the Melia standard that ive come to expect.",3,2017,08,11
28,Beautiful ,"I must say Melia hotels just make me smile, the customer service, decor and even down to the smell of beautiful fragrances they have across the corridors. You just know when you're at a Melia hotel, their hotels are built with love. Once again, really happy with my stay beautiful views I stayed at The level, just perfection. I was really impressed with the restaurant they had as well me and my partner enjoyed a beautiful  5 course meal (basically). Half of which we did not order they were just giving out tastings and so on through the night, which for me being a foodie I loved it! The staff were amazing ah just perfect. I can't wait for the next Melia hotel I go to, I'm in faith you guys will never fail me for my future travels! 
Thankyou again! ",5,2017,08,08
28,"Lots of positives, but a few negatives...","A last minute three-night booking and a flight delay saw us arrive at stylish and contemporary 'The Level Melia Sky' at about 1.30am on a Wednesday morning, so unfortunately missed the opportunity of checking in at the bespoke 'The Level' reception desk, albeit the standard  Melia Sky reception on the ground floor was perfectly agreeable and the reception team wide-awake!

We were allocated a sea-view room on the lowest of 'The Level' floors (20th) with a bed comfortable enough to accommodate a great night's sleep. Beyond the black-out curtains was a lovely morning view with a distant sea outlook and an urban landscape below. The room was of average floor space with a rarely used bed-end sofa and occasional table taking up useful space but looking good on the room spec'. 

Room cleanliness was good, but on two of the three full days housekeeping omitted to clear used coffee cups, milk cartons and all-importantly to me replenish the Nespresso coffee capsules which was disappointing. Calling to ask for some in my boxers wasn't on the agenda. 

The location of the Melia Sky was debatable having previously stayed in the heart of Les Ramblas (Hotel Bagues), it is in a far more remote residential location meaning if you're looking for sightseeing this isn't a good bet, but for a great selection of local bars and restaurants and a non-tourist adventure it fits the bill nicely. 

A taxi rank is outside the door and 12Euros gets you to Les Ramblas in 20 minutes, a taxi from the airport at 1am to Melia Sky - 46Euros and a midday return to the airport 29Euros, with the journey taking around 30-40 minutes.

Albeit a lovely hotel with great staff the location would mean a return visit to a more centrally located hotel would be preferable.",4,2017,08,05
28,Long weekend girls trip,"Perfect 4 night weekend in Barcelona. Stayed at The Level 26th Floor with a city view which was absolutely stunning. It overlooked most of Barcelona, and you could see Montjuic castle, which lit up at night, as well as a beautiful sunset every day. Amazing service from the moment we arrived, from all the hotel staff as well as The Level staff. A special shoutout to Paramjot from The Level for his outstanding and efficient service, a very warm, friendly and helpful person. If you are stuck on where to go for the day or night, he has excellent recommendations and advice. 

The hotel is in a perfect location if you are pro-active and want to make the most of your time in Barcelona. Closest metro station is Poblenou which is a 5/10 minute walk away, and tram line is right outside, which takes you straight to cuitadella park behind the main beach area. The metro station takes you straight into the main areas of Barcelona too, very easy to navigate, similar to TfL. Lots of small bars and good tapas restaurants around the hotel, a short 15 minute walk to one of Barcelonas nicer beaches, gives you a chance to look at local shops on the way, less touristy. 

The hotel facilities are high standard, spa is quiet and peaceful, perfect after a long day of exploring. Pool is a beautiful, relaxing area, always plenty of loungers and helpful staff around, and good back ground music. The Level has free snacks and drinks (alcohol/non alcohol) throughout the day until 10pm, which was a nice touch. Breakfast was fabulous, lots of choice and stunning sea views with the sun rise. 

Overall, excellent hotel, I would not stay anywhere else if I was to visit Barcelona again.

Many thanks to all the staff.",5,2017,08,02
28,What a great time,"I travel for a living and I promise you a great time too. hotel is not in the middle of the city but close by metro service and staff awesome, Cristina is the best (by far) she goes above and beyond to help you with everything. Many thanks Cristina.  ",5,2017,08,02
28,wonderful experience !!,"Cannot fault this hotel in anyway, my wife is very particular and she loves this hotel she wont hear of going to any other and we have been to a few, but this one stands out I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience from check in to check out. The customer service and the staff the facilities the room, breakfast the Merkado the views from the level overlooking the city and sea were all well worth it. Definetly looking forward to our next visit. Keep up the good work !!",5,2017,07,25
28,Touch of luxury-with high standard breakfast!,"Absolutely loved every minute we spent at this resort. The location is perfect. Close to the beach and also to the city. The hotel is separated into two sections. They have the Melia which is downstairs lounge and the lower levels. The Level is the 5 stars hotel with an amazing 25th floor view and a fine dining restaurant!
Do not miss the breakfast! I wish I could have that breakfast forever. The breathtaking taking view, the personal chef, and the huge selection of drinks/foods are amazing.
They also have a swimming pool located on the rooftop. It is not heated. They also have a really modern gym and spa. If you book this hotel, you will never want to leave !!",5,2017,07,19
28,Outstanding customer service and perfect for family or business,"I remember when I was booking this hotel I found it quite expensive comparing to other options, but I did it anyway as it was the only one with a swimming pool and an acceptable fitness room. After my stay at The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky, my opinion is that it was a worthwhile use of my money. 

The room was amazing (Jr. Suite), the lounge service with food and drinks was very handy and the customer service was way above average. Excellent breakfast as well (we preferred the one served on the ground floor better than the one served on 24th floor). I recommend this hotel and I certainly will be there again when returning to Barcelona.

Only to mention one disadvantage, the fitness room officially closes at 21:00 (but it is possible to use later if needed), however the air conditioner was turned off about 19:30, making the room unacceptably warm.",5,2017,07,10
28,Amazing hotel with fantastic customer service,"Cannot fault this fabulous hotel, with it's great facilities and wonderful staff. So polite, friendly and attentive. We didn't want for anything. Food was lovely. Bar/Pool area stylish and relaxing. Good location - not far from the centre so quiet and relaxing -  easy to get out and about.",5,2017,06,30
28,Loved everything about this resort,The Level at Melia Barcelona was gorgeous! Service was phenomenal. Loved going to the lounge for free drinks and apps. The pool area was very relaxing. Good walk to the beach and surrounding areas. Would stay here again if I couldn't get anything closer to the beach!,5,2017,06,26
28,Excellent 🏩 ,"This was our third visit to this property and was the best.
First time level lounge was good but rooms were very dated.
Second time room was all refurbished but level lounge under construction. This time everything was all done and brand new.
We would recommend to any of our friends.
Highly recommended.

28,Wonderful stay; great hotel,"We've just returned from 5 nights at  the Level while we attended Primavera Sound. We've stayed at the Melos Sky before and decided this time to try The Level; an excellent decision. This is a lovely hotel and the added extras you get as a Level guest are well worth it. We arrived and were directed straight to The Level check in on the 25th floor and given a glass of Cava as we checked in; a very promising start. Our room was on 28th floor with a great view of the city. Other reviewers have commented on the design  of the rooms; it is relatively hard to have privacy in the bathroom area but we coped. The pool area of the hotel is lovely and the spa- free to Level guests- is also nice. Breakfast served on floor 24 with amazing views over the sea from the terrace is wonderful- great food, choice and service. The Level lounge has drinks and snacks available all day and the main restaurant has an area reserved for Level guests in the evening which was also lovely. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,06,04
28,"Started off great, but ended up disappointed!!.","Our room and view were nice, A good size for  all our belongings.THE PLUS:  Staff was excellent and very friendly, personal and helpful for bookings, recommendations.  The upstairs and downstairs ""happy hours"" were a very nice plus.  The PROBLEM was with housekeeping Only the lst 1-2 days were adequate.  After that  ...for days 3-7 Poor ..even with intervention  Dirty items left in room , even a soiled pillowcase left on the floor. Mirrors and sink area unattended. There was a lot of noise early in morning in hallways that was loud from staff/housekeeping ? Complaints were made twice..to no avail. Extremely dissapointed.  When on last day discussed with ""manager "" on Floor 25. We were offered a ""drink"" and an apology ...totally unacceptable from  5-Star Service.  Nothing else was offered or even check upon for our satisfaction.  VERY DISSAPOINTED",3,2017,05,23
28,Superb ,We stayed here as a family. Being in The Level you have a dedicated 5 star check in on 25th floor.  Champagne is served while you check in and the staff are wonderful. We had a junior suite on the 23rd floor which was amazing. Views over Barcelona are stunning. Breakfast is served on 24th floor whilst looking out to sea and the uninterrupted views of the city. Would book again. ,5,2017,05,17
28,"I thought it was going to be great, but no.","Rooms are pretty and fully automated. Housekeeping was much better some days than others (one day, they did not even remove used glasses from the night before). The bathroom has poor lighting, specially if you want to do make up. The breakfast is absolutely amazing and the dining room has a great view.

However, the service from The Level and the Guest Services team was awful. We had an issue with the room temperature (unbearably high), we called The Level, they said they were sending someone, but nobody came, we called again an hour later, they sent someone who did not fix the problem. We called again, they said it could not be fixed and it was our problem if we could not sleep. We called again, pretty angry, then someone came from the downstairs reception with a technician and they were able to find a solution that was acceptable for us.

On our last day, we tried to have a drink in the lounge, but there was no ice, we were told to wait, and after waiting for 20 minutes we just left and had a drink elsewhere. No apology was even offered.

We got an email from Guest Services apologizing after we had left (honestly, not much help for us at that point and no compensation was offered at all, so it felt pointless). I answered the email explaining in further detail what had happened and my comments were ignored.",2,2017,05,15
28,Amazing experience ,"Everything was great about this hotel from friendly staff to spacious modern rooms( we had a family suite)to free snacks for the level members to delicious scrumptious breakfast with views of the city .I would definitely reccommend this place .
Breakfast was amazing and we could order omelettes of our choice .staff was very friendly and helpful too .
The only negative thing if I have to pin point is it is a little far from downtown but because cabs are readily available so that wasn't a big deal for us ...it is close to the beach though",5,2017,05,12
28,sky melia,"We stayed here for 3 nights beginning of May it's a fantastic hotel the best one we have stayed in in Barcelona  absolutely cannot fault it , close to metro and tram stop and a short walk to the sea front ,we will defiantly stay here again .",5,2017,05,07
28,Amazing experience,"Very comfortable hotel, friendly and helpful staff.
Don't miss the spa services and all facilities of The Level (delicious exclusive breakfast, Lowe amenities, etc)
Try to book a sea view room! It's really nice! ",5,2017,05,06
28,Outstanding two night stay,"This hotel is lovely, but it's the staff that really made our stay outstanding - they were all helpful, efficient, friendly and professional.  We arrived at the hotel quite early after leaving a cruise, the reception and housekeeping staff went the extra mile to get a room ready for us in less than hour.  We upgraded to an executive suite and it was fabulous (luxury after spending the previous week in ships cabin). 
The breakfast room on the 24th floor has beautiful views and is a great way to start the day.",5,2017,05,03
28,Excellent service,"We enjoyed the excellent and very friendly service, the wonderful view from our room. Ideal location for a family trip to Barcelona as it is close to sea side and easily accessible by public transportation.",5,2017,05,01
28,1st trip to Barca,"I visited here as a last minute getaway with my cousin. Lovely hotel, lovely room, lovely staff all round wonderful hotel. Was able to travel around the city fairly easily and was able to get to beach on foot. Was a little walk away but it was great taking in the sites. ",4,2017,04,30
28,An upgrade to die for,i'm a frequent visitor of the great city Barcelona.. i tried a few hotels.. but Melia sky is really the best.. great value for money.. It was allready my 8th stay in this great hotel.; and now its renovated.. i like it even more. This time i got an upgrade to a room on the 27th floor.. sorry.. it was not a room.. it was a suite!!!   with a great view over barcelona.. looking at the la sagrada familia.  The hotel is kinda close to everything.. if U do not mind walking.. U can do it all on foot.. or a taxi costs around 10 € to every must see location in Barcelona.  The checkin is friendly fast.; and helpfull.;  and there are always taxi's waiting at the hotel.. (very important if u want to go to the game for example).  anyway.. the suite.. it was big.; with a small living room two showers.. a bath.. 2 big screen tv's.. if u like luxury and a great view.. this is the room u need to take.. only small remark is t he 20 € U get as a meliamember... its ver confusing.. sometimes it s for the minibar;.sometimes for the bar.. etc..i did not read the small conditions;. and so needed to pay my minibar .. instead of the 20 € for free.. anyway .. im principal guy.. dont like this techniques.. i wil  use the hotel again.. because its really the best value  U can get in Barcelona,5,2017,04,30
28,Time to relax,"We had an excellent weekend. I only had to complain once because ""our neighbours"" arrived late in the evening and completely drunk, shouting and laughging. Of course the hotel was not responsible for this creepy behaviour and we were offered another room the morning after. Was not required because these people left. Thanks God! The rest. "" Dos cielos"" excellent. We did not like to have to wait for our table around 45 minutes since we had reserved dinner time three weeks in advance. That was the slight black spot we had to put up with.",5,2017,04,30
28,Loved every second,"Can't rave enough about our experience at the Level in the Melia Barcelona. Starting with the staff who were impeccable in every way, so lovely and so helpful, couldn't do enough for us. The reception staff were so great and made us feel incredibly welcome. The rooms were incredibly comfortable and the views were incredible everywhere you went. The drinks bar and the breakfast and the tapas bits down stair were such lovely touches to a the stay and the hotel was lovely. Shame the pool wasn't opened but just gives us an excuse to return!
Thank you for our stay!!
Ps. Don't be afraid of the metro! It's so easy and a nice walk away from the hotel and you walk past a little shopping centre and lots of shops etc that we popped into before you even get to Barcelona!",5,2017,04,26
28,Best Experience Ever,"Staying at The Level at Melia Sky Barcelona was incredible. All the atention from The Level crew were awsome, they made our stay perfect. The breakfast view,   The level bar, the room were out of this world. I would recomend The Level experience 100%.",5,2017,04,22
28,Amazing treatment,"We are in room 2104 at the moment and we must say that this hotel rates as the best that we have ever visited.
The room is spacious, comfortable and the views great.
The real bonus is the quality of the staff, my wife and I are here on a city break to celebrate our 45th anniversary and have been treated like celebrities from the first moment. However, the staff do not know about our special visit so it is clear that everyone receives this treatment.
One downside is that the pool is out of action for improvements and we do fancy a swim. Never mind, just move on and enjoy the endless drinks and great treatment.
We do hope that we are able to persuade other friends to visit and that we can return in the future.",5,2017,04,18
28,Good stay with room for improvement ,"I travelled to Barcelona in March for my stag do, a group of 10 of us stayed at The Level. The hotel was great - modern, big rooms, nice decor etc. As others have said, the location isn't slap bang in the middle of the tourist areas. This for me was a good thing, for others it could be perceived as an inconvenience but personally I liked the location as it felt a bit away from it all which made it more relaxing. Taxis were easy to come by, and for those who don't mind a walk we took a taxi to sagrada familia, walked down through the park, across to port Olympic and then back to the hotel along the beach front. So despite not being 2 minutes walk from everywhere, it was within comfortable walking distance for those who are a little more active. The steam room, sauna and Jacuzzi were great areas to relax and recharge in, whilst it was easy to feel comfortable in the rooms which were a good size, with nice bathrooms. There were also some nice touches such as being able to stream music via Bluetooth from your phone to the tv to utilise the speakers, and a Nespresso machine. The complimentary drinks and snacks added to the spa access and above touches definitely made the level feel good value for money. The only negative was the service was average at best when it came to breakfast on the 24th floor and lunch on the ground floor. In fact average is too high praise for what at times resembled something from fawlty towers. Coffee had to be ordered 3-4 times at breakfast, wrong starters were bought out at lunch. The clearing of plates is something that has to be requested rather than something that simply gets done. And there were a couple of instances of a la carte items ordered at breakfast simply not arriving at all. The above is highly surprising for a 5* property in truth. Despite this, the value for money means I'd be likely to stay here again when next in Barcelona, however I'd be hoping for some improvement from some of the restaurant staff. ",4,2017,04,14
28,Always my place to be in Barcelona,"This is Always my place to be in Barcelona.
Despide the renovated the rooms, this is not the same atmosphere, but still very good ""LEVEL"".
The lounge is not as nice as before.
I love it and it will continue to by my place in Barcelona.",4,2017,04,13
28,Splendid stay!,"Room we stayed in, at 23rd floor, was great, spacious, modern suit with big bathroom & shower area, quality amenities, and spectacular view! Beds are very comfortable and there´s a pillow menu available. 

The Level breakfast is served at 24th floor, in the Michelin star restaurant “Dos cielos” where the actual kitchen is set as a buffet. Very nice. You can have your breakfast at the terrace as well so you can start your day watching the Sun rising over Barcelona enjoying variety of quality food offered. Very good food is served in ¨Mercado¨ restaurant at the ground floor too.

Spa and gym are good. As The Level client you have an access to the spa included. 

One of the best places to spend some time within the hotel (apart of pool, which was closed as we stayed in January) is The Level lounge at 25th floor. It’s cozy, stylish, relaxing and beautifully decorated space. Some snacks, drinks and beverages are offered throughout the day, same as concierge services. The staff is very helpful, friendly and professional. 

All together, we had wonderful stay. We enjoyed the hotel’s facilities and staff’s attention, especially one received from Mr. Jaumot, reception assistant manager, and Mr. Robles, guest experience manager.",5,2017,04,12
28,"Mixed feelings - nice hotel, variable service, not for families","Stayed for 3 nights. Some things were amazing, some were disappointing - and I will never forgive the fact that a member of staff really upset my 11 year old son, ruining what would have otherwise a very special day in Barcelona.

Have had some time to reflect and want to make sure I write a balanced review though, so:

- Good things

1) We booked a family room and it was spectacular.  On the 20th floor with an amazing city view, 2 huge wall mounted TVs, super comfortable beds (enormous king + big, comfortable sofa bed) and a clean, modern and spacious bathroom (with impressive double shower and great toiletries) 
2) Breakfast view - on the 24th terrace, looking out to the sea as the sun rose - again spectacular
3) Some of the service - when we checked in there was a special welcome message and a welcome surprise waiting for us in the room - really nice touch and really appreciated.  Ground floor lobby desk was super friendly and super efficient + Jolanta on the desk on the 25th floor was always super helpful with tips and helped us print out tickets etc

- Bad things

1) Location is great for business / conferences etc, but if you want to do sightseeing it's invariably a cab ride / Metro ride to the sights and city centre (though taxis are cheap and were always available on the taxi rank outside)
2) Breakfast service on 24th floor was a bit chaotic (having to repeatedly ask for coffee / plates to be cleared etc)
3) Service in the Level on 25th floor - I don't know if it was because we were a family but we weren't made to feel particularly welcome, even though the children were quiet and well behaved.  The 25th floor should be a premium service vs the downstairs lobby, but at times it felt like the poor relation (limited selections of drinks, running out of ice etc.) The worst time though was when one of the staff (Mark) literally ordered us to leave.  My children were tired, hungry and were having a quick snack, when at one minute to 11 he marched over to us.  We were just finishing, but he told my children to stop eating / drinking ""right now"" and ordered us out as it was closing time.  He was so aggressive and rude that he succeeded in making my son extremely distressed - a nasty end to an otherwise amazing day.

So overall, the hotel is clearly aimed at a business audience rather than families, however the rooms, the facilities, the decor and the food are really really good.  Some of the staff are exceptional too, but unfortunately for us some of the staff were not.  With a little bit more attention to the service this hotel could be truly outstanding.",3,2017,04,07
28,Spring vacation ,"I opted for the ""level guest"" experience aka upgrade.  It was well worth it.  Greeted by Yolanda who provided the hotel layout, made reservations for tours, spa etc.  The breakfast included offered variety from fresh fruit, made to order omelettes, juice, Cava etc.  I took Yolanda's suggestion and get up in time to have breakfast at sunrise which produced an amazing red sky. Great experience!  ",5,2017,03,30
28,No Faults Here. Gluten and Lactose free,"A very comfortable and enjoyable stay. The rooms are clean and airy. (Air con didn't go cold enough for my liking but then I live in Wales and am used to freezing).
The staff are extremely polite and helpful. Breakfast was a pleasure and they catered for my Gluten and Lactose Intolerance with no problems.
Wishing the pool had been heated. Would definitely stay here again.The hotel is a little out of the main town, but only a hop away on the metro. We preferred not to be in the center of the night life.",5,2017,03,24
28,WOW,"OK, we did a big splurge and upgrade to a suite. Big comfy bed, big bathroom with double shower heads. Lots of space for clothes, very modern lighting and a view of  Sagrada Familia. The living room could be updated with better furniture, however we rarely used it. The breakfast area for the Level is ""Outstanding"" views of the Mediterranean from the 24th floor. Breakfast is very good, try the eggs benedict with or without the hollandaise sauce. We got up early to watch to sunrise 9spectacular). The lounge snacks are not the best I have experience, but the Cava never stops flowing. This hotel is not near the tourist areas, however it is a 10 minute walk to the hop on hop off bus stop, street car stop in front of hotel and the taxis are reasonable. 
We got special treatment from the staff at the level lounge and felt spoiled during our 6 day stay. Big thank you to Yolanda
Turn left out of hotel and walk 5 minutes to Carrer de Balbio, a pedestrian walk way with restaurants and bars that the locals frequent",5,2017,03,14
28,Did not live up to me high expectations but free cava is nice !,"I perhaps had too high an expectation of this hotel within a hotel but there were a few things that just did not make me give this hotel a higher rating. If there was a 3.5 score I would have awarded that. The free nibbles and drinks are nice touch but as you have to go down to the restaurant and sit in a rather soulless cordoned off part of the large downstairs restaurant instead of the lounge on the 25th floor to eat and drink it did not feel special. Room was ok, but could do with an upgrade as I had to report a few issues ( curtains did not open for instance as the pulling mechanism was broken so you could not see view) . Corridors lol you are in a prison, but the breakfast room on 24th floor is very nice ..eggs Benedict were sloppy and undercooked and came with purple and red crisp covered in hollandaise sauce..very odd.. This hotel was walking distance from the offices I had to visit for work so very handy in that regard but taxi to and from city centre will cost you 12 euro each way. The Loewe toiletries are lovely and made up for some of the other disappointments.",3,2017,03,13
28,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, lovely views, totally 5 star!","We travelled during the first weekend in March, a little chilly but we love Barcelona whatever the weather. 
Upon arrival at the hotel, our bags were taken and we were taken to the 25th floor, whereby we were greeted with a firm handshake and a glass off cava. We were checked in and upgraded to a lovely sea view room. The room was modern, with a mini-bar and a beautiful bathroom (one sink each!). 
We had access to the Level Lounge (25th Floor) with snacks, wine, soft drinks and cava included. We also had a free drinks selection, light bights and a personalised service on the ground floor from 7-10 each evening. 
The breakfast was also delightful. Eveline was an excellent host, and got us fresh smoothies, coffee and orange juice each morning, as we watched Barcelona go by from the 24th Floor. 
We loved the whole trip, and there is so much more I could mention.. JUST VISIT!",5,2017,03,10
28,"Most amazing hotel I have ever visited. Food is unreal, the staff are amazing, the decor is beautiful the level is 5*!","The Level at the Melia is absolutely amazing. I had been recommended to stay here when visiting Barcelona, and had been told how beautiful it was and they was not wrong. The décor as soon as you walk through the doors was beautiful and all the staff at the hotel could not have done anything more for us. 
Anything and everything we needed, we would call down to reception and they would deliver it to our door within moments. My boyfriend has an obsession with his clothing being ironed, and the hotel offered an amazing express ironing service which he was very pleased with. 
As we was staying in the level part of the hotel our stay included an open bar, free snacks, including sweets, cake, biscuits, nuts and olives. We had access to complimentary prosecco and wine 11-7 and access to the spa where the Jacuzzi and sauna were to die for. There was also a terrace with loungers and a pool which were also beautiful and perfect for when the weather heats up in Barcelona. 
Our room was homely and spacious, with a beautiful view and a huge shower. 
The hotel is a little bit out from the main part for example the Ramblas, but this did not matter to us at all and I am glad to have stayed a little bit further from the crowded areas in the Ramblas, there was also a taxi rank right outside of our hotel which came in very handy.
Breakfast has got to be the most amazing breakfast I have ever see. Everything from chocolate croissants, to cheesecake, to bacon and fresh fruit, you could also order fresh omelettes and smoothies prepared there and then for you. you could not have asked for more. The lady at the front of breakfast (unfortunatley I didn't catch her name) who would show us to our table was the loveliest and sweetest lady and offered us everything.
Whilst enjoying your breakfast on the 24th floor, you had the most perfect view of Barcelona with the sea in the background the most perfect way to wake up. In the evening this was also the bar area to enjoy drinks, the barman was so smiley and accommodating and I have never tasted such a tasty pornstar martini ever!
This hotel offers you everything and anything you need for a holiday too Barcelona and I would stay here over and over again. I cannot fault it one small bit.",5,2017,03,09
28,WOW! perfect city break!!,"This was the first time i was visiting barcelona, my partner had been before off a cruise but never spent a weekend in the city. We travelled 27th dec 16 -  30th dec 16. I was a little worried the hotel was out of the way but honestly the taxis are so so cheap whenever we wanted to venture into the city it was like 7-8 euros in a cab! From the moment we arrived we felt like royalty!! We booked the level as we got a great deal and we couldn't believe all the extras we got during our stay - personal check in with free cava and snacks ( all of which you could have in this area from morning until evening!! including juice, cola, beer, sweets etc) we went to the room and the room was really spacious  and fantastic views of the city!!! Also from 7pm - 10pm in the evening we had use of an exclusive area in the main lobby where we could help ourselves to snack, canapes and drinks including cava, beer, gin, vodka and a much more all included in our hotel stay!! The staff were so friendly and happy to help at any given point. Breakfast was so nice lots of options on the buffet and also an extra menu to order smoothies from and eggs benedict etc all included too. As we went in the winter the rooftop bars werent open but one evening when we came back we both enjoyed a gin in the higher level bar with fantastic views of the city and complimentary olives with our drinks which were hands down the best olives we have had in our lives haha On our first evening the lady who checked us in recommended a lovely local restaurant serving authentic spanish/catalan food which we went to and it was delicious!!! We are in our mid twenties and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and would 100% go back in a heart beat!! Also barcelona at this time of year was amazing, really sunny days and probably a little quieter than the summer months.",5,2017,03,09
28,Outstanding hotel,"Location is ideal for visiting all attractions, yet not in the hustle and bustle areas. The Level is excellent value and the staff are outstanding. Yolanda was exceptionally helpful, providing inside tips for places to visit and booking tickets for us. Room is spacious with an awesome view over the city. The breakfast on the 24th floor with a view towards the sea, with the sun rising, certainly gets you ready for the day. We will be returning in the near future. ",5,2017,02,21
28,"Great service and food, strange bathroom layout","We visited The Level for a half term break - my teenage son and me. We chose the Level for the design features, the rooms and the complimentary snacks and drinks. 

The breakfast, free tapas and lounge offering were tremendous as was the service from every single member of staff. It is a business hotel primarily but we still experienced helpful and charming service from all levels of staff.

The hotel is a fair way out of town but it is only 4 metro stops into the centre and the metro is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

Our main bugbear with the hotel was the room. Not only did it not have a door to the bathroom area and a window between the bedroom and bathroom without a blind, the sliding toilet door didnt shut properly. This was a very awkward arrangement for a mum and teenage boy travelling together and I didnt want to pay 30euros a night to upgrade to a room that might offer more privacy.

So overall a good hotel with lovely food and service but with some odd room layouts.",4,2017,02,17
28,"Nice hotel, but away from sights","We have chosen the hotel particularly for the reason that its away from the crowded touristy areas. We have been to BCN before and didn't need to stay in the center this time. However, it really takes up your getting to the hotel. You can get to the hotel by metro from the airport, but will have to make few metro line changes, will take you up to an hour. If the location is not your top priority, then the hotel is lovely and the area surrounding the hotel too. We took bus nr 7 to the center. Wonderful breakfast and views form the breakfast terrace. The room was spacious and clean, but the see-through window between the bedroom and the bathroom is tricky, even if you are staying with your husband. Staff at the hotel was mostly lovely and very helpful, both in the level and outside the level area.",4,2017,01,18
28,Great hospitality,"Definitely go back, courteous staff and amazing rooms. Location not too bad but taxis readily available. Service with a smile always. Very relaxing environment, peaceful lounge and a beautiful terrace for breakfast. Staff accommodating and requests promptly actioned.",4,2017,01,12
28,Review of Melia sky,"This hotel is perfect! I stayed here over new year with my partner and we couldn't be happier with our stay. The hotel has extremely high standards and the decor is modern and chic. The staff are friendly and happy to help and the cleaners always keep the room looking gorgeous. When checking in we were formally greeted with a drink and were presented a map of which we were told where the ""go to"" places were in Barcelona. The room had an amazing view of the city and the room was finished to perfection, with a mini fridge, hairdryer, large tv and bed. Breakfast was included in our stay which is on the 25th floor, the breakfast area is amazing and you can see across the whole of the city. Taxis are always available where Las Ramblas and our favourite, the Gothic Quarter, are only a 10/15 min drive away. We ate downstairs for our tea one night which was absolutely gorgeous, my partner had the steak which was perfect! Would recommend this hotel to anyone, guaranteed you won't be disappointed! We will be back again to visit in the summer time. ",5,2017,01,02
28,Worst customer service I've ever experienced,"I can not stress enough how HORRIBLE my experience has been at this hotel. Of note: I paid for the five star the level experience. First we arrived at the hotel and were directed to check in at a seperate area. We were told to sit down and wait as there was a few people ahead of us. Understandable my boyfriend and I sat down without a problem. But slowly time went on (probably about 40 minutes) and I noticed we still weren't being helped. They completely forgot about us... even though the staff seated us and we were in plain sight of the staff the entire time. Next, we had overslept for our breakfast we had paid for due to illness. I understand it was our fault but they did not try to make it right. They would not accommodate us in any way for this missed meal. Finally, we came back to the hotel exhausted today. We decided to just eat dinner and have the complimentary reception that is offered to us nightly. Well, the reception is not going on due to a party and we were not informed. This also means the lobby restaraunt and bar is closed. So we went up to the restaraunt on the 24th floor. This restaraunt is booked solid. We explained our situation to the staff and concierge and no one assisted us or made recommendations. The hotel is newly renovated but as you can see the staff are not up to par. I will not be back nor will I be recommending this hotel to anyone.",1,2016,12,31
28,weekend trip,hotel rooms looking very tired the reception areas and bar was very nice but not impressed with room at all unless this hotel give the rooms a face lift i don't think i'd return and after staying at other melia hotel around the globe i found this very disapointing for a major city of the world,3,2016,12,28
28,Trip to Barcelona,"Having stayed close to the beach on a previous occasion we decided to return to the area but try a different hotel - a great idea!
The hotel, was a great choice. Ten minutes walk from the sea front and 10 minutes by metro to the city centre - best of both worlds!
The hotel was excellent. The room, breakfast and service first class.The 'level' experience was well worth the additional cost. However, what really makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the staff - they are courteous, extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble. You are really made to feel very special.
We will definitely return.

",5,2016,12,27
28,"Good hotel, service did not meet expectations. ","This is our second visit to Barcelona as a family. We chose the hotel for its location, decor and comfort of the room (The Level - Junior Suite). On arrival, we received a cordial welcome at the reception on the 25th floor. The newly renovated suite was tidy and spacious with a city view which captured the Sagrada Familia. We were disappointed to find that the air conditioning did not work. Instead of blowing a warm 26 degree current it was instead blowing cold air that had chilled the room. As we did not realise this until later in the evening when it was bedtime for the little one, we opted to switch off the air conditioning rather than report the issue and entertain a long wait for it to be resolved. Result was a bit if a cold and uncomfortable night's sleep. What further disappointed us was the lack of regret we received from the hotel staff. You would expect a better response with a little more substance than just a simple sorry from a 5-star hotel. Clearly the staff including the management lack training on how to manage customer grievances. The air conditioning was fixed in the morning but the removal of the plasterboard ceiling panel by the technician to gain access to the air con unit left the floor littered with dust and pieces of white plasterboard. Housekeeping were kind enough to overlook the mess which remained on the floor until we returned later in the evening. Needless to say we had to complain to reception on the 25th floor and housekeeping were sent to vacuum the room but very little by way of an apology for the inconvenience other than a simple sorry. This now suggests to me another meaning when I was told upon arrival that I should feel at home - maybe they meant I should have brought with me my own Dyson to clean the room. Final gripe was use of the jacuzzi (hot-tub). Prior to booking, I called the Melia Sky and spoke with reservations to ask specifically whether my 5 year old daughter would be allowed to use the jacuzzi in the absence of a warm swimming pool. As a parent, you know that the way to have a relaxing stress-free vacation is to also ensure the little one feels included. Not fair if mum and dad are separately running off to enjoy the hotel facilities whilst the little one is confined to the room. The hotel representative confirmed there would be no issue so we booked. One week before travelling, I felt the urge to call again and confirm once more. Same response. However, once we arrived, we were informed by the receptionist at the Spa that only children 16 years and over could use the jacuzzi. We explained that we had twice received contradictory information and that had we known we would likely have chosen another hotel. Only when we escalated to the management were we told our daughter could use the jacuzzi only when the spa is quiet with no customers (i.e. 11AM). Very disappointing. ",3,2016,12,22
28,"Modern Hotel with nice views over Barcelona, with good connection to the center","I spent 4 nights, checked in on line, after the arrival completed the process quickly. My room was on the 22nd floor with stunning view over Barcelona and further to the sea. The hotel is located in nice and modern area, with shops, trams, and buses. The room was comfortable, though lacked cosy ambience  due to dull colours and plastic floor. The bathroom is very well equipped with a bathtub, walk-in shower, 2 washing basins, with view to the sea throught the glass wall.usses nearby. The furnishing of the room is rather modest and simple for a 5 * hotel.  There was a coffee machine and an electric kettle, with daily supply of tea and coffee. The breakfast was on the 24th floor, with panoramic views, especially for the guests of 5 star section of the hotel.  From 19.00 free snacks and drinks downstairs.  To get to the city center you can use either a tram, and then change to the metro, or go to the metro yellow line.  To get to the hotel from the airport I used the public transport; L9 metro line, then changed to the red metro line at Torrasa, and then to the tram at Marina stop. I took about 1 hour, I had much time and found this trip very interesting - the fare was included in my 5 day ticket for €30 which I bought at the airport. On the way back I used a taxi, which costs €40, the taxi stand is in front of the hotel, it takes half an hour to get to the airport. To sum up I enjoyed my stay, the hotel was modern with amazing views from top floors, exactly what I wanted.",5,2016,12,18
28,Excellent,"Stayed for three nights at The Level, all round just excellent!

Staff were helpful and friendly.  Room was well appointed, very comfortable.  

Breakfast was of good quality.  Refreshments in the lounge and downstairs as part of The Level lounge access were warmly welcomed.

All in all an excellent hotel.

28,Our first visit to Barcelona a memorable one,"We are just back from a brilliant 4 day trip to Barcelona and we are so very happy we picked this hotel, the service was great very friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us to ensure our stay was perfect. We enjoyed it so much we booked to go back at Christmas as soon as we were home and we can't wait.
The rooms had everything you need, I especially liked the brand of toiletries they have. The breakfast selection was perfect, varied and everything fresh with the choice of seating areas and the tables are nicely spaced. 
It is in a nice area near to the beach with plenty bars and restaurants should you not want to head into the city centre. Getting around is easy.",5,2016,11,23
28,City short break,"The Melia is an impressive hotel in Barcelona. Stayed for 3 nights with my partner in the 'level' hotel and weren't disappointed. The rooms are extremely modern, clean and comfortable with great bathrooms. The pool area was comfortable if not a little small.
It's worth upgrading to the 'level' as this gives higher rooms, access to an exclusive (and very special) breakfast on the top floor and convenient access to complimentary drinks and snacks.
The location is not ideal if sightseeing is high on the agenda as it's an (expensive) pain going to the centre, but as we wanted a relaxing get a way and to see Barcelona in the evenings, it was perfect.",5,2016,11,23
28,Melia Barcelona Sky is an amazing Hotel,"My wife and I completed a stay at t Melia Barcelona Sky for her birthday. I upgraded to Level and was not disappointed. Our room had a view of the ocean, was very clean and modern. Breakfast was included in our package. We also received free drinks and snacks at 12 and Tapas and drinks from 7 - 10 pm, both are perks of upgrading to Levels. The staff is very friendly and helpful no matter the request they were there to meet our needs. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona and looking for a modern hotel with great customer service. Definitely deserving of the 5 star rating.",5,2016,11,20
28,The Level offers guests a great experience,"We booked two rooms for two nights, on a family visit to Barcelona.
As guests staying at The Level, our luggage was taken directly to the separate check-in for Level guests on the 25th floor. We were offered Cava and canapes during the check-in. The guest lounge has a great view across Barcelona and is a comfortable and welcoming space, with refreshments always available. The staff service was warm, friendly and sincere.
We were allocated connecting rooms. The décor was modern and minimalist, and the rooms had big windows to admire the view down to the Mediterranean. The bed was comfortable and we had a separate lounger by the window. We received a welcome message and fruit in the room.
Breakfast was included for guests at The Level and we used the separate space at the back of the restaurant. There is a buffet of delicious food displayed and we could order additional dishes. Staff service was superb. We also enjoyed the food and drinks available to The Level guests in the evenings in this space (wonderful cakes).
The only downsides were that the hotel has too few lifts and these are too small, so there were long waits for a lift. The main check-in area for guests is small, so it becomes crowded in this small space.",5,2016,11,09
28,Amazing break!,"
This was our first visit to Barcelona and we were not disappointed. We found the hotel easily, getting the renfe train and then a metro to the nearby pouble nou. On arrival we were taken straight to the 25th floor to check in with a glass of cava. The staff were so helpful and happy to give recommendations, make bookings etc. 
Our room was a junior suite and was exceptional. The views across the city were breathtaking and having 2 showers was a first. We often enjoyed the complementary drinks and snacks on the level lounge before heading out for a meal.
Breakfast was delicious, level guests have a separate area where you receive great service and a menu with some items you can order such as eggs benedict and smoothies. The choice at breakfast was exceptional, even some Chinese food!!
We stayed for 4 nights and I only wish it could have been longer. The location tho not central is good, only 5 min walk from the metro or a street bustling with restaurants and bars. Beach was about a 15 min walk. We hired bikes one of the days which I would recommend for exploring the area. If you fancy a luxury break in Barcelona I would highly recommend the level at the sky melia! ",5,2016,11,07
28,Magical Melia ,"My husband and I stayed here on the start of our Europe trip and what an amazing start. From the welcome upon arrival at the door to the farewell upon leaving I couldn't fault this place, we chose the Level, as we wanted the opportunity to sample the new lounge and rooms, they did not disappoint they are spacious and with super views of city or sea. The colleagues in the level specifically felt like old friends with educated recommendations and advice on what to do. The Level itself was well managed and was a very nice concept, they even have a separate area in the restaurant where you can enjoy breakfast and evening canapés and cocktails if you would rather use this than the lounge on the 25th floor. Overall worth the little extra for this facility. Well done to the team, an amazing hotel with a great spa. ",5,2016,11,05
28,Utterly amazing!,"What a fabulous experience.  Well worth the extra cost.  The Level is amazing, the hotel is amazing and the staff are amazing.  Wonderful welcome in The Level, facilities are excellent.  Complimentary bar and inviting array of snacks.  Fantastic views. Enjoyed Jacuzzi, bit chilly for the pool but it looks beautiful. The lift is fast!  Breakfast in The Level is relaxed and informal and we also loved the main breakfast dining room downstairs with vast array of food to choose from.  Bedrooms are designed with a contemporary style, very smart.  Huge comfortable bed, fabulous shower and TV fills the wall.  Staff are friendly and helpful, plenty of information about their beautiful city.  Good location, 20 minute walk to the beach or less than 10 Euro in taxi to Port Olympic.  What a brilliant experience from The Level, made my party feel very special.  Cannot recommend it enough.",5,2016,10,31
28,Great location ,We stopped at the hotel but never upgraded to the level experience and it was fine. The bar area was good but just another bar to have a drink before going out and the upgrade for free drinks and snacks would have been wasted. The staff were excellent and helpful and the breakfast top quality. The hotel location was perfect being a short walk to the main street of bars and excellent restaurants. If you wanted to visit the sites of Barcelona the underground station was a short 5 minute walk and for just over 10€ you got a ticket for 10 trips. You did not need a ticket each and it was very easy to use to explore the city. Overall the hotel was perfect.,4,2016,10,18
28,The look of hotel was amasing,"was on the 28 floor.  Are room was so good we had few over the city and to the basilica familia. the basilica was nice to see but the area around it was not pretty to look at and that was what we were looking at.  the level was good if you wanted to get free drink and snacks.  you need to be on high floors to get the level and breakfast on 24th floor witch was good.  the level is 5 star, lower floors are 4 star.  Room had bathroom open as you could see in only glass border between bed and it.  if you do not like highs the windows are from floor to ceiling.  no window to open at all only airconditioning witch I found gave us a cooled.  the hotel was nice over all.",4,2016,10,11
28,"Pay the extra, it's well worth it","Stayed for a weekend and loved it.
Hotel is clean and comfortable, the Level takes it to another Level (pardon the pun).
Service was very good, free food/drink in the dedicated reception is a nice touch.  Breakfast was excellent",5,2016,10,10
28,Anniversary Break,"We booked The Level at Sky Barcelona for our 41st wedding anniversary as a special treat. We have stayed at many of The Level Melia Hotels, last one in Madrid and always have had positive things to say about each one. This one however just did not come up to the same standard as the others.
Positive's
Very clean rooms.
Great beds.
Great breakfast.
Extremely helpful staff. 
Nice area.
Good view out of The Level windows.

Negatives.
Floor covering more like a Travel Lodge.
Ask about the Bathroom before you book. Not very private.
Only had room service on one day and had to ask for milk, tea etc.

 The biggest complaint I have though is this. We paid quiet a bit extra for The Level service but to be honest it just wasnt worth it. The snacks were all the same for the 4 days we were there. Dried up ham/cheese spread sandwiches, tuna fish, bits of lettuce, nuts and sweets.There wasn't any 'hot' snacks as stated and no variety at all. Although there was plenty to drink both soft and alcoholic and plenty of variety there, not every one sits drinking all day. Come on Sky Barcelona take a look at how your other hotels operate on The Level. The Level manager could be a bit more pleasant as well, he wasnt very welcoming.
When the renovations have been completed and The Level returned to the top floor it will probably be fantastic, but through no fault of our own we didnt get what we had paid for.",4,2016,10,07
28,Wow!,"What an amazing hotel.  

From the moment we entered the hotel all staff were friendly and helpful.  Our room, 27th floor of 29 was very impressive.  Especially as the rooms have floor to ceiling windows!

Everything is clean and attention to detail is everywhere.

Nearest Metro station is Poble Nou and is about 10 minutes' walk away.  Airport bus is the best travel from the airport and terminates in the city square, which in turn has a Metro station.

We were reluctant to leave.",5,2016,10,05
28,A Great Stay in Barcelona,"We loved our stay at the Melia.  From the moment we entered  the building, we were treated wonderfully.  While one of our party was checking us in, the rest of us were invited to have a glass of Cava - after a long overnight flight from New York, nothing sounded sweeter to us.  The staff in both the lobby and the rooftop lounges were particularly friendly and helpful.  A delicious breakfast on the rooftop, with a spectacular view of the city on a beautiful morning, will be hard to beat at any other hotel.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  We were sorry to have to check out at the end of our stay and cannot wait to return someday soon.",5,2016,10,04
28,Lovely relaxing couple of days spent at this hotel,"I was finishing off a holiday in Spain and wanted to stay at the W. The W rates started at £650 per night for a basic room with nothing else. I am so glad we found the Level @ Melia and stayed there. It was well worth the money (which was much cheaper than the W). Great service, wonderful breakfast and and lovey staff. I would highly recommend it and will be staying there again!",5,2016,09,30
28,Enjoyable but not quite what,"Booked the level for 2 nights following a cruise from Athens and I am a fan of melia hotels generally on this occasion my expectations did fall short.

We arrived very early and the hotel did its best to accomadate us immediately which was nice , if anything check in was too long perhaps our fault because we arrived very early and was tired from an early start disembarking from the cruise ship. I had booked a suite in the level which was on the 22 nd floor with great views. The room was a great size with separate sitting area settee I should have been wowed regretfully this was not the case:
The room had been recently renovated so should have great the flooring was grey hard floor tiles more in keeping with a budget hotel rather than a 5* ,2 fantastic 50 inch TV in each room not that we wanted to watch much tv but with no English channels a small let down. Room was eqquipped with well stocked mini bar and kettle unfortunately for us no milk sachets. The bathroom whilst very nice has a huge window ,whilst no concern for us did feel a bit odd.  A shower room with 2 showers was unusual and very nice. Loads of toleteries slipper and robes so really good in this regard.

The pool area is on floor 6 and really nice unfortunately for me I was woken up on the Friday afternoon as a wedding was taking place. I was woken up on 3 occasions once round the pool, once to drilling which I think was the renovations to the top floor level lounge, and once when a member of staff entered the room there is no do not disturb sign to hang outside.back to the pool which we were able to use the following day without interruption and brilliant after a day's sightseeing .there is also a spa on the 5th floor which is available complementary for level guests with a whirlpool and sauna steam room which is really nice, we went after the pool was closed the whirlpool was chilly which did surprise as would have expected to be hot.

The level is been renovated so the hotel has sections off part of the main dinning room and bar which was an ok area but not what we were expecting, great for nibbles and a drink but nothing special. We had stayed at the intercontinental Athens at the start of our trip and the lounge area and offerings were much superior.

Staff were excellent really friendly and are an asset to the melia ,the service in the level breakfast was fantastic even dimmed the lights at sunrise to get the best view,we had brilliant help from guest relations who booked tickets to park guell for us , recommended a fantastic tapa restraunt for us and on the Friday night when the heavens opened a member of concierge stood in the middle of the pouring rain to hail a taxi then provided us with umbrellers so we didn't get wet.

The hotel is a little out of the way so a good 15 minute walk to the front not an issue for us but some may want to be more central or nearer the beach. Not the hotels fault in any way but we had some lets say interesting taxi routes which did get a bit tiresome.

This is a nice hotel which could be so much better I was asked at checkout if I had slept well which I didn't not because of the comfort but due to interruptions as detailed above.

In summary nice staff ,excellent pool area, room was not as plush as expected .would we go back yes but don't think I would pay extra for the level",4,2016,09,29
28,Very nice smart Hotel,We had a very nice stay at the hotel. The staff were very friendly and rooms we clean and very nicely decorated. The bed was really comfortable. The breakfast on the 24th Floor was the highlight in the morning and the view seeing the sunrise and sunset was spectacular. We will be coming back to Barcelona and to here again.,4,2016,09,29
28,long weekend in Barcelona,"just had a long weekend at the Melia Level sky in Barcelona. The staff were fantastic, the room excellent and the breakfasts were as good if not better than any hotel we`ve stayed in. We also liked the idea of the free gratis tapas.",5,2016,09,27
28,Tries hard but falls well short,"I really wanted to buy into this five star hotel's message of exceptional personalised service and a unique client experience. However while it does well in some respects it fails miserably in others. The hotel consists of the upper floors of The Sky Barcelona four star hotel but has its own highly appointed check in area on the ground floor. A near 15 minute wait to be seen while the one receptionist checked in another guest gave us plenty of unwanted time to study the surroundings. Not a good start. Worse was to follow when we experienced the ""exclusive"" executive/club lounge. It's actually situated on the ground floor of the four star hotel and fully opens out onto that hotel's bar/restaurant area. Although a sign at the foot of the three steps that separates it from the bar states it is for use by The Level guests only, everyone uses it. No checks are made as to which hotel you are staying in (or even if you are staying at any of the hotels). A group of ""guests"" even took in their own carry out food and ate it in full view of hotel staff while taking advantage of the free drink and snacks. It's nothing better than a public bar and is reminiscent of an airport departure lounge with cheap furnishings. When paying for a five star hotel I expect to relax within the five star hotel and not in a lounge in a four star hotel which is open to everyone. It should be sited on the high levels which has a bar with fantastic views. The great breakfast served on the high level terrace and attractive Level Grand Premium Sea View room can't save this hotel from being an overhyped failure.",2,2016,09,25
28,The Level is not 5* hotel just 5* price,"Was in Barcelona for a friends wedding. after paying 254€ per night I was given a room with sticky lino tiled floor, wonky toilet seat and not enough space for a desk. This reminded me of a cheap hotel. The Level is meant to be the 5* part of the Mela Sky hotel. The only 5* part was the view from the 24th floor for breakfast, even then the staff were friendly but flaky with the service",2,2016,09,24
28,"Pleasant stay overall, location not ideal","Stayed for a week on holiday, when checking in was offered an upgrade to a larger room for 190 euros per night, whilst a larger room would have been nice we were not prepared to pay that extra. Our room was small although it had everything we needed. Maid service was generally good but products used in bathroom did not get replaced during the week and we had to request additional coffee pods each day. After 2-3 days we came across the bar for Level guests which included complimentary drinks. It would have been nice to have been advised of this at check in. On the Sunday we decided to have a relaxing day at the pool, spoilt by a group of very loud young men an girls who appeared to have been staying just for the weekend. No one objects to people having fun but the noise and behaviour was not what you expect at that type of hotel. Surprisingly no one all day asked them to quieten down. Food and service at breakfast was good and all staff friendly. Concierge service was friendly but in the end we found our own way round the sights, information on pre booking some tours would have been useful, eg Park Guell. Location of hotel such that we nearly always took the metro to places when going out, 5-10 min walk to nearest metro station. Would consider staying again if in Barcelona as provided everything we needed overall but location not ideal for getting around all the sights, nothing within 15 mins walk.",4,2016,09,24
28,Fabulous stay - we will be back! ,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Melia Sky, we were on the 19th floor so had access to the level. This included breakfast, canapés and unlimited cava, beers and soft drinks.
Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly lady called Oksana, she took us to a separate check in desk (for level guests only) which made us feel quite special and then we were given a nice cold glass of cava - much needed after our travels! After checking us in Oksana went through the map of all the sights to see. She was really informative and this really helped us to pick what/where we would go each day.

We checked into our room which was really clean, stylish and the air con was lovely and cold. The only thing that was quite strange was the lay out of the room, the bathroom area has a glass window into the bedroom - not very private! 

The facilities in the hotel were excellent, the pool area is beautiful and we were allowed access to the cabana beds which were so comfy and relaxing.

All in all we've had a lovely stay and hope to return next year.

 ",5,2016,09,15
28,Excellent choice of hotel!,"Having spent a recent weekend in Barcelona with a friend, we opted for The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky because a) we wanted a modern hotel with a pool and b) we were looking for something conveniently located. Upon checking in, we quickly realised that we had made the best decision and the hotel could not be more perfect!

When booking, we paid the slight premium for 'The Level' access and it was well worth it. We enjoyed the daily selection of snacks and cava / wine / beer offering and breakfast (served in the newly the refurbished dining room) gave 'Level' guests access to a sunny terrace with sea views. The pool and spa area were a welcoming retreat after a day out sightseeing or spent on the beach. Rooms are spacious and clean and although we never used the mini-bar, it offered a great selection.

The highlight for me staying here though, was the staff. Every staff member was pleasant and polite and could not be more helpful (in a non-pushy way). For a hotel this size, they definitely go the extra mile to personalise their service.

Thank you Melia for a wonderful experience, we will certainly visit again.",5,2016,09,12
28,Perfect Stay,"We stayed for a long weekend and had the most wonderful stay. We were made to feel welcome from the start and everyone went out of their way to make our weekend perfect. 

Check in was really quick and the staff where super friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and the view to die for. 

The staff at 24th floor was excepcional. Specially our waitress Gissela, she waited for us every day with all of our whims, and the lovely Louisa gave us a great restaurant recommendation for a romantic evening.

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, especially for a romantic weekend.",4,2016,09,12
28,Great Hotel!,"I travel a lot for business and holidays, and I'm very fussy about hotels! The Level at Melia Sky definitely met my expectations.  I had moved to this hotel after a business trip - I tagged an extra few days on and had a long weekend in Barcelona.  I really enjoyed my stay here, and I would go back to this hotel.

Good Points
Newly refurbished rooms, very comfortable bed, everything was clean and well maintained. Robes & Slippers, lots of storage (although an 'open plan' wardrobe!)
Great staff - all very polite and helpful - I felt well looked after
Breakfast on 24th Floor is lovely - great choice of food, egg chef etc - everything you'd expect.
A really nice relaxed and relaxing atmosphere in this hotel.  Nice without being at all pretentious. 
Good location.  About 3-4 mins walk from the metro station - metro takes you straight into the centre of Barcelona, very easy.  Beach is advertised as a 10 minute walk away. It's more like 20 minutes to get onto the beach, It's a flat walk, but those who are less able should take a cab.  
Note - the closest beach is a gay nudist beach! It's just a small section of the beach, so if this is not your thing, then just walk a little to the left or to the right along the promenade for family beaches.

Negatives
Not many!
Executive lounge on the ground floor with drinks/canapes - think this is a temporary situation during refurbishment.  It was ok, but not special, felt a bit like an airline business lounge!
Bathroom is quite 'open plan' - this includes the toilet! I was on my own, but if you're sharing a room with a friend or someone you don't know very well - think twice!!",5,2016,09,10
28,The level at melia Sky,"Overall great place rooms well kept pool area and pool were great friendly staff but a few niggles, went to check bus times back to girona airport and staff tried to help but gave the wrong information so was nearly back at the airport 4 hours before needed to be luckily I rechecked myself and easily found the correct timetable this must be a basic request and  surely they should know about the Barcelona bus to airport!! Didn't really get the level experience requested hard pillows as per pillow menu never got them requested poached egg at breakfast first day never got that and second day we were put in a corner and forgot about had to ask for drinks so felt let down by the extra special service not received requested twin beds in both rooms only received one room that had twin beds",4,2016,09,06
28,"Melia Sky Hotel ""The level"" a good choice for your stay in Barcelona","As a big FCBARCELONA  fan, i try to catch at least a few championsleague games a year. Luckely for me they play in one of my favorite cities in Europe.

As a frequent traveler to Barcelona i tried a lot of different hotels. But i must say.. Melia sky is my favorite.

The hotel is located just a 15 minut walk from the beach. All the hotspots are just a 10 € taxi ride away.

This time i went with a special lady so i wanted to make an extra effort and decided to upgrade to ""the level"".

These 5 star rooms or located on the top floors of the hotel and it gives u some advantages. Seperate personal check-in and check-out, a lounge area especially for the level guests where u can have some tapas, cava or other drinks for free, access to the gym and spa and also some extra's in the room.

At my last stay i saw the loungebar was gone (during renovation). I was very happy to see there was again a bar in the lobby... The lobby is very impressive... And as a level guest u can drink or eat some snacks for free in a private area of the lounge.

So about our stay
We had a nice completely renovated room on the 20th floor. The bed is really awesome as usual .. Definitely the best bed from all the hotels we have stayed.. The room is clean.. The airco works very good ... And the rainshower is perfect..

Only small comment i can think of,  was missing a chair in the room (handy to put clothed on that u shortly worn). Also the toilet door did not close completely... I really like my privacy on the toilet so that can improve..

The pool area is a plus ... The pool is not to big .. but still better then in most hotels of the same pricerange. Nice bar with very friendly staff. Small comment on the occupation of the beds around the pool, be on time if U want a nice place.. it can be crowded :)

The breakfast was very good... To much to choose from... Only cleaning the tables and appointing them to new guests could go faster in my opinion.. But i must say the friendly hostess made it acceptable.. One thing that should improve too .. is the fact that the some of the staff in the breakfast room did not understand and/or spoke any English..(my mother language is dutch, so my English is not perfect.. but understandable) A standard knowledge of spoken English should be obligated in a hotel... But that is a typical Spanish problem..A last critical note as mentioned before we upgraded to a ""level"" room breakfast included, and 5 days on a row it was not clear at breakfast. And it should not be an issue .. because its included  and we were on the level, so just the room number should be enough proof.

Customer experience desk

The hotel has a customer experience desk, as a guest U can ask for information , restaurant reservation, things  to see etc.. In my opinion some one who works on that desk should know Barcelona very good. This was not the case.  I would suggest that the people of the customer experience desk get a budget to try all ""the places to be"" in Barcelona.. From a commercial point of view they should know what they are talking about, f u ask for a certain restaurant or activity.

Some last suggestions
When we checked out we needed to ask about the 20 eur free bar spend.. In my opinion They should know it..

Give level guests a different colour of doorkeys.. No more list nescessary for breakfast and also handy to check for the level area..

Now they did not ask us once if we were the level guests or not.",4,2016,09,01
28,Great city hotel,Fabulous rooms in this hotel. The new suites are luxurious and spacious with floor to ceiling views of Barcelona. The Level lounge facilities (in an area of the ground floor bar) were great with lots of snacks and drinks. Breakfast was served on Level 24 in Dos Cielos and the food and service were both excellent. Thank you for a lovely stay,5,2016,08,31
28,Not worthy of a 5* title!,"Hotel is really well situated, not far from the beach and close to Poblenou metro station.

Negatives include:
- Small flies cover the food at breakfast, lunch and dinner (lounge area). All over the fruit, meat and pastries which only got worse throughout the week - very off-putting.
- Hidden charges (mini bar) €5 for gum or a mini pack of Pringles, we ended up replacing them ourselves to avoid charges!
- Concierges try to help with bookings of tickets, but it seems they don't know much of the area. Essentially they help you to Google what you're looking for - just DIY!
- We asked for a iron 3 times but never received it...not a biggie really.
- One incredibly moody lady who asks for your room no. at breakfast - she ushered me out of the dining area thinking I was 'trespassing'. She was condescending and rude, thankfully wasn't to be seen for the last 2 days.

Positives:
- Breakfast reserved for Level guests on the 24th floor was amazing, huge choice and incredible views.
- Room: huge bed and incredible pillows. Large shower and nice touches like chocolates left on bed every evening.
- Comfy robes and complimentary slippers.
- Pool area was beautiful and relaxing, just like the photos.
- Very kind staff, always smiling and helpful. They will go above and beyond for you!
- Wifi.
- One item of clothing is ironed free of charge.
- iPod/iPhone dock available on request.
- Extremely clean and modern.

We wanted to treat ourselves to 5* luxury for the first time before going back to work...we had a great week but wasn't entirely satisfied.

On the surface, the hotel has a great appearance, but it seems as though everyone's winging it underneath. Still finding their feet perhaps?

I would say this is perfect for a business trip.",3,2016,08,27
28,Best experience in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Melia Barcelona for a few nights, and must say, that we are impressed over the great service from all the employees at the hotel. Smile and always ready to help. The breakfast are in top, the room are well equipped, and the pool area are great .And there is only 1K to the Beach. Will we come back somme otter time..?? Absolutely.
Erik Brinks",5,2016,08,25
28,Perfect weekend away,"We booked this hotel as a last minute weekend get away and loved every minute. The room was amazing as was the breakfast. The staff were all so helpful especially the lady who checked us in and out (can't remember her name but she said she was from the Ukraine if that helps) she was so helpful and pleasant with everything we asked, defiantly deserves some recognition. 

Would defiantly recommend and will hopefully return, couldn't fault it. ",5,2016,08,09
28,"Room Service ""Delivery Charge"" ","As a whole...we are having a good experience with this hotel (so far), BUT...

From the tens and tens of hotels I have visited in my life, having a Room Service ""delivery charge"" is a new one! 

We pay for the water we order, PLUS a delivery charge, its Managment Policy they say!

Found out about this when we ordered 1 bottles of water, then I wanted to order a bucket of ice, they said they will charge me an extra 4 Euros to deliver the ice.

Wanting water, and planning ahead to avoid the delivery charge, I then ordered 6 bottles, some salt, and an ice bucket all at once.

Extremely strange policy in a 5 star hotel.

Shame!",3,2016,08,08
28,Nice room but The Level Lounge is closed!,"When we arrived we noticed that the reception was located on the ground floor, not at the 25th floor. They also informed that we had access to the lounge, also at the ground floor, they didn't even mention that the lounge on the 25th floor was closed, I had to ask.

I think its really poor that they don't inform you regarding this, I also assume that this renovation must have been planned for quite some time! We booked this hotel 5 weeks before arriving - no info on the refurbishment anywhere.

So the premium package we were expecting was nothing like what we were given. 

However, the room that we stayed in was great.  Family room with city view (the Sofa bed was the best we've ever seen according to my kids).

The breakfast on the 24th flor was really great.

The pool area is nice as well.

We like to spend time on the beach and you can walk to the beach in 10-20 minutes.

We will definately come back to Barcelona but we will choose another hotel.",3,2016,08,04
28,Nice but nothing special,"I booked this hotel for 4 nights to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. i paid extra to stay in the 'level' part of the hotel. in my opinion im not sure i could tell the difference between the level and regular part of the hotel. on the website it says 'VIP Check in' this is simply a different area in the lobby and we were asked on 3 occasions, one of those being when we checked out to go to the regular check in desk. our room was nice i cant fault too much about the room other than the fact it could've been a bit bigger.

The lounge which is currently a separate area in the Lobby Restaurant is poor to say the least! a couple of nuts, cold and hot drinks and that was it really! there was no sense of 'VIP' in the stay at all!

We ran out of toilet paper and soap which was never replaced and when we phoned down to reception or housekeeping - our phone didn't work.
 
On top of all this i emailed the hotel a week before toe ensure they could decorate the room on my girlfriends birthday. this was confirmed by the Level Reception and never done so really disappointing. 

I don't think i would go back and i am unsure i would recommend this hotel.",3,2016,08,04
28,"Great hotel, lovely suite and customer service and staff top notch!","We stayed at the The level For a long weekend July 8th. We were three ladies for a girls relaxing weekend in Barcelona and the hotel was ideal. The junior suite was gorgeous with the perfect amount of space for 3 people. You have to be quite ""familiar"" due to the bathroom layout and window through from the bath to the main bedroom. We were on the 27th floor and the view was fabulous! The room had every amenities! The check in was great and the doorman, staff were superb and very friendly. The room was spotless. The breakfast was excellent and again this was down to the superb friendly staff. We also enjoyed drinks and nibbles in the bar. We were however really disappointed not to be able to enjoy the outside bar/breakfast area  that is advertised for the level guests with views as this was part of the reason for choosing this hotel.(it was closed for a refurb and we had not been informed on booking) The pool was busy but to be expected in peak season so it was hard to get sun loungers in the afternoon but we enjoyed soaking up some rays! we also enjoyed the spa facilities. The hotel is about a 15/20 minute stomp to the beach then a further 15 minute walk along the beachfront to the nightclubs at night. Taxis were about €9/10 euros to the centre/this area or beach. I would stay again if I return to Barcelona. I would highly recommend for the staff and room and facilities.",4,2016,08,03
28,Mis-sold & disappointed,"Still displaying now on the app & website: Awe-inspiring 360º views from our Dos Cielos restaurant & terrace, which boasts a Michelin star and is managed by the renowned Torres brothers

The Level: Exclusive benefits and access to the private “The Level Lounge” on the 25th floor with unparalleled views of the city of Barcelona that makes your stay at the Meliá Barcelona Sky truly unique and unforgettable

Based on this information I upgraded for £50/night extra only to find out both are closed for renovation.

The level lounge is currently a separate area of the restaurant in reception where there are drinks and a few crisps, olives & nuts available - sometimes sweets - we asked twice if there was going to be any tapas but were told after 7pm - we never saw more than a limp sandwich the whole time we were there - you are not allowed to take drinks outside if you are a 'level' guest

Before arrival I booked a premium sea view, then upgraded to The Level when I read about the benefits, the room we were allocated was overlooking the building site next door - we complained & were reallocated a sea view room which we couldn't fault & the next day we were shown to a reserved sunbed & offered complimentary Pimms which was a nice touch, breakfast was very good & all staff friendly & helpful

It's such a shame as I wouldn't have booked this hotel if I'd known about the renovations - which should be made clear on the website, Meliá app & other booking agents websites - our agent had not been informed. The level upgrade is currently not worth the money - staff told us we can always return in October when the renovations will be completed.

28,Closed and not told about it beforehand!,"On arrival we found out that The Level, the premium part of melia Sky Barcelona was in fact closed for refurbishment.

Not told beforehand, not informed via email, nothing on the website!! 

So the premium package we were expecting was nothing like what we were given.

The 25th floor lounge with views of the city were replaced with a lobby bar!

A list of other issues and breached these with the staff on three separate occasions before we had any type of response and that was our last day.

Building works going on outside our room from 730am on day of check out.  

Massively over charged for a substandard and unadvertised product.  Will not be returning if this is how customers are treated. ",1,2016,07,31
28,We love this hotel,"This was our second visit to this hotel.  We stayed here in July 2015 for the first time and then went back this July to celebrate our Silver Wedding.  We were not disappointed.  The hotel gave us a free upgrade to a suite.  We had a bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries in our room on arrival, plus a personal note from the hotel welcoming us back.  We then had the same thing on the day of our Silver Wedding as well.  

Booking The Level experience is a must.  You have your own check in desk, where the staff are so helpful.  anything you need help or advice with they will help you with.  We had booked a table in the michelin star restaurant for our anniversary, but the restaurant was being refurbished so we they had to cancel our booking.  Rather than just leave it like that, they went a head and made us bookings at four other restaurants.  We then got to choose the reservation we wanted and the staff sorted it all out for us.

There is a private lounge area just for guests who have booked into The Level experience.  Here you have fantastic views of the city, free drinks and a free self service finger buffet and snacks for most of the day.

We love this hotel and will definitely be returning",5,2016,07,30
28,Great view from the 24th floor,We stayed 3 nights in the suite at the 24th floor. Around 55square meter. 2 huge tvs. Big bed. Big bathroom. Spectacular view of the city but not the ocean. Very friendly staff. We traveld with our 10 month old baby and staff was very attentive.  Only complain: no cereal at brekfast buffet.,4,2016,07,27
28,Luxury and excellent staff,"Had a great experience at this hotel. From our welcome early in the morning, to helping with where to go and how to get there, the staff were excellent. Our room was ready for us early, and although there's not lots of storage the beds are comfortable and the shower good. Bit weird with glass everywhere but we soon got used to it! Breakfast on the 24th floor was fab, nice wine and cava and good snacks. I agree with other comments about the flies, but most stuff was covered while we were there. The pool was lovely, we always got a sun bed and overall just enjoyed a bit of luxury and a break away from work! Easy to get everywhere, either on foot or by metro and having the Rambla Poblenou near by gives lots of good options for tapas and sangria. Recommended, would go again.",5,2016,07,25
28,Disappointing ,"This hotel sells itself as something truly special and one of the best in Barcelona. 

I was disappointed to understand that The Level is closed and will be closed. The hotel paints itself as truly personalised it's a very standard service that is the same from everyone. 

Rooms are good. Housekeeping have Issues. The attention to detail is lacking. Beds are comfortable. 

The rooms have no opening windows and have air conditioning.  This isn't the best and doesn't cool quickly. It seems to work at times but not always. 

The Level experience is poor food hygiene is lacking and the food is left out. So a lot of flies are attracted. 

We did speak to the management team when we had been in the hotel and we are going to return when the building works have been completed. I understand this is in 3 months. 

Until then I would either avoid this hotel or I would accept that it's just not going to be great. ",2,2016,07,23
28,not a 5 star..........,"very disappointed in this hotel which is supposed to be a five star.not up to standard of a 5 stars for me.first of all we had to go 20mins around barcelona to access the car park as there is roadwork on the street where it is.would have been good to be informed by email prior to our arrival instead of having to turn round to finally found the access.wlecomed nicely at the level reception and we were taken on the 25th floor to be checked in.I was on mly own with two children, even though the staff was lovely for the check in i had to carry by bags to my room on my own....then we had a room service for lunch apart form the pastas and the mozarella and tomatoes the rest was not nice.club sandwich soggy and roasted chicken so dry we couldn't eat it.never mind i had to call the reception for them to prepare the sofa bed as i announced we were three the day before but the bed was not made.we went out then come back at 6,30 for a swim, we were told bar was closed as there was a party that night and the staff wasn't very nice there.breakfast in the room were very good.but the maids who came did not change our glasses or put new ones . only three capsules of coffee although we have a machine in our room.i find this very cheap.the room service that night was good and the staff also, but as there was a mistake in my order i call the reception who said well if you want to change ill have to charge you again 4,50 euros...unacceptable and i was not happy.on the check out the day after i was charged for more than i had and it took them 1 hour to chack me out.absolutly horendous.i will never go back or recommend",3,2016,07,18
28,Still at the rigth Level !,"I have spend, again,  nights & days there.
I come there couple of times a year.

Always a very good service and equipements.

This time I had the new renovated Executive Suite, with new decoration.
The new room are very very confortable and cosy.
Even I was definitely prefering the previous style more brigth, modern with color touch, and and was better with the bed faced to the sea....

Also, it was not good that the Level Liunge was closed for renovation, so it was a disappointment, where I expect to be positively surprised when the new lounge with terrasse will be opened soon.

The service is always very good, but maybe too much turn-over too much student, who do not know/reconize usual and regular customers.

I will be back !!",4,2016,07,15
28,Lovely hotel in the suburbs but in easy reach of metro,"We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Level - floor 27! We were a party of 5 including 2 children. 
Right from the entry, we were taken to an exclusive check in area and offered drinks and snacks. We were there by 1pm and our rooms were ready for us, luggage delivered and all was great.
We had suite rooms, so we had a living area, bathroom with separate toilet area, bath, double sink and double shower, then there was a bedroom area, huge windows overlooking the city view which was stunning at night and during the day.
We had access all day to the complimentary lounge which included all drinks, including wine, beer and Cava, soft drinks and hot drinks too. They changed the snacks through the day, including, nuts, crisps, sweets, olives, sandwiches, fruit etc.....more than enough to keep you going.
Breakfast was in an exclusive restaurant for the Level guests on the 24th floor, it wasn't a massive selection but we were more than happy with 2 children and a vegetarian in our party.
We used the pool area, although the pool isn't that big, there are plenty of loungers, a bar area and pool beds around. Our children used the pool a few times and they were comfortable doing so, it didn't feel too quiet and adult focused to us.
It took us a day or 2 to get our bearings with riding our way around from here, about 5 minute walk to nearest metro station which got us to La Rambla in about 10 mins, with a further 5-10 min walk from there. We walked to the bus stop for the tourist bus which took about 15 mins, about 15 mins to the beach and we also walked to Sarada familia which took about 35 mins at a slow pace.
All in all the hotel was great, the staff were excellent and welcoming and we would stay here again if were to visit Barcelona.",5,2016,07,14
28,Amazing,"Wow!! Had an amazing weekend at this hotel. Went for my partners birthday, and it exceeded all expectations. Room with a fabulous view and drinks in a bar on the 25th floor. Staff were so polite and friendly, we will be back this year and hopefully a few more years to come.",5,2016,07,13
28,"Solid accommodations, but not sure they were to ""the level"" of the The Level","Overall, we were satisfied with our stay on The Level, but it was not entirely seamless.  Let's go through the pros and cons:

PROS:
* Modern decor
* Nice pool area w/ friendly staff
* When we booked, they were running some special where you get 20Euros a day of free minibar or room service (but see below for con).
* We got a welcome bottle of champagne upon arrival.
* The Level lounge was great and a good place to meet up with the group with which we were traveling.  There was always cold cava and beers available (which are included in the room price).  Snacks were available too, but the offerings sometimes seemed a little thin.
* The hotel staff made it a point to treat those on The Level with an increased/better level of customer service.
* Breakfast was served in a separate space from the rest of the hotel.  It was much nicer than the main restaurant.
* 24 hour room service 

CONS:
* The rooms were fairly small. For instance, the only way the table/coffee table would fit was pushed up against the bench at the end of the bed.  There was no closet and very few drawers, so most of our stuff had to sit in our luggage.  No unpacking.  
* Even though we had the promotion that gave 20Euros free of minibar everyday, we were not really able to use it because the hotel never refilled our minibar.  This occurred despite the fact that I called reception on two separate occasions on two different days to request that it be refilled.  What's the point of the promotion if you can't actually use it?!
* We were late heading out to the airport on the day of departure (long story, but our flight was delayed only to have the flight time pushed back up).  We called down to reception, explained the urgency, and asked that they call a taxi for us.  We were told this would happen. When we got downstairs, there was no cab to be found and no one had called.
* The spa is small, but aesthetically nice. The services were somewhat lacking, however.  We asked the concierge to make a reservation for us and stressed that we wanted firm massages.  We reiterated this to our therapists (in Spanish, so there could not have been any confusion) as we were started the treatments.  My massage literally felt like someone just stroking me lightly for an hour.  On scale of 1-10, the level of pressure was about a 3.  Such a waste of time and money.  Would not recommend the spa as a result.
* Room service was not able to accommodate something as simple as ""no mayonnaise"" on a sandwich.  They literally said they were unable to do that, even though it was the only modification requested to the dish.  Strange.",4,2016,07,10
28,"Love, love, love this place!","My husband and I visited Barcelona for a couple of days before a cruise, and wanted to stay somewhere relaxing, and yet close enough to major sites. We found the perfect place in the Melia! 

We stayed on The Level and think it is 100%  worth the cost. The service is amazing! The 25th floor lounge offer nice treats and drinks day and night! 

Our room was very comfortable and modern. It is kind of an open concept though, so the bathroom is open to the room, which can be a little awkward.

The location is great. Quiet, but not far from the action. We used the metro to get around, just a few blocks away, but taxis are another option. 

You should give it a try, you won't regret it!!!",5,2016,07,09
28,Love this hotel,"We have stayed here twice now. Just love this hotel. Rooms are spacious and decorated in great modern style with all mod cons and luxury toiletries. Views are phenomenal from the higher floors and Level lounge. We prefer the city view to sea view rooms as you can see more, particularly at night when the city is lit up. Only negative is the slightly open bathroom with glass window into the room - might be a little uncomfortable if you are not very familiar with your room mate! We love the location which is in more of a residential area so less touristy and good restaurant selection within 5 mins walk. Easy taxi or metro ride to all the sights. Pool area is lovely with plenty of loungers. Pool small but never many swimmers perhaps because water quite cold but it was perfect for us on hot days. Level lounge is well stocked with drinks and snacks you can help yourself to all day - a great extra. Service friendly and staff went the extra mile - for example spending ages trying to hail a cab for us on a night when there was a strike so few available. Only criticism was housekeeping which did little more than make the bed and dirty glasses and towels not removed. However we raised this with the hotel management and they explained was being reviewed and dealt with. ",5,2016,06,29
28,Beautiful hotel ,"Amazing customer service. Would definitely visit again. Also offer great breakfast and appetizer all day. 

 The hotel offer a spa available all day. One of my favorite hotels while visiting Europe.  Pool, jacuzzi and great massages. 

The room are extremely nice and clean, very modern. 

 ",5,2016,06,27
28,Second time in 6 months ,So good I returned within 6 months! Rooms  are a little small but facilities good. We chose a sea view room and in the days that the sky was clear the views were amazing. Swimming pool beds were comfortable and  hotel is in a good position not too far from the centre and about 5 mins to the beach. Barcelona itself is an amazing city and I am liking to return again this year. ,4,2016,06,27
28,Beautiful Hotel,"Located just off the Diagonal, the hotel is close to the tram station. Hotel staff were all very friendly and versed in several languages. The rooms were spacious clean and modern. The club level was open 7 am to 11 pm. There were two club venues to chose from. One was quick and light, the other was full service. Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,06,22
28,Amazing Trip,"This hotel is an amazing place to stay and if you have the luxury to stay here I would choose this one. I already know I want to come back and would recommend to anyone staying in Barcelona. It's not local to the airport but is close by to a metro station which can take you to the train station where you can get a train to the airport from. into town, again get the metro as its a max 10 minute walk to the metro station. 

The staff at this hotel were very helpful and always very attentive to their guests. My boyfriend and i arrived to then be taken to the 25th floor, where we were offered complimentary drinks and snacks for our whole stay. the staff were excellent at informing us about the details of the hotel, informing us also that we could use the terrace on the 24th floor for a buffet breakfast which offered all sorts from cake to dim sum to Spanish foods. 

The lounge area was beuatfil and over looked barcelona city, this is wherte were allowed to enjoy drinks and snacks all day. there was a pool on the 6th floor which is decored very nicely. 

overall, the staff were great, the room service was excellent and the overall stay was amazing. for me it was a luxury which I would spend money on again. ",5,2016,06,21
28,Luxurious!,"Apart from the distance from where everything goes on essentially, the hotel itself is beautiful! We had a room on the 19th floor and stayed 4 nights. The room was very clean and sea views immaculate. I think that the breakfast has room for improvement as one day there were baked beans and the next day there was not for example. Also I felt as if the air con was not working as our room on the last two nights and morning was ever so hot we had to keep the curtains closed which meant we couldn't experience the view.

We had access to 'the level lounge' where staff were inviting and friendly. The lounge is beautiful and large and never felt over crowded during my stay. The minibar has so many choices your bound to use it during your stay! The spa area is lovely! With a small gym area I preferred being in the jacuzzi than the swimming pool as the pool was cold. the pool area was lovely and chilled.

Me and my partner found ourselves walking down to the beach and then along the beach towards the city centre. It is around 15mins walk to the beach and then another 20 mins walk along the beach to get to port olimpic. We would do this daily and then rent scooters for a few hours (WHICH WAS AMAZING- i was scared at first) where we could ride to la rambla within 5-7 minutes. It was a really enjoyable and efficient way to get around the city and is totally safe! as long as you ride safe.

There is a metro station literally 4 minutes away from the hotel which takes you to all the main stops you would need for your stay in barcelona as a tourist.",4,2016,06,19
28,"Great Staff, Comfortable and Modern","We recently traveled to Barcelona for our vacation and stayed at the Level at Melia Barcelona Sky. We had lovely accommodations and the staff was very attentive. When first checking in, you are ushered into a private check in area, complete with water, coffee and munchies if you are so inclined. The staff helped direct us to various locations in the city, providing us with specific directions and suggestions. The hotel even has a card at your bed where you can order your specific pillow requirements. The spa appeared lovely, though we didn't go. The pool area is beautiful. The morning breakfast buffet is wonderful and offers something for everybody.  The view from our room afforded views of the city and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The only small drawback was the actual location of the hotel. It's way off the beaten path. If you are wanting to stay in the hub of town, this is quite far away. We enjoyed the old town portion of Barcelona and our hotel was easily 5 miles away. We are walkers so we enjoyed walking through the neighborhoods to see the real Barcelona. But if you are at all walking impaired you might want to reconsider due to the distance to monuments, old town, etc. Otherwise, we highly recommend this hotel for its service. The hotel is approximately 4 - 6 blocks from the beach.",4,2016,06,15
28,Modern and plush,"Stayed four nights @the level melia sky for my partners 30th birthday.
I really loved this hotel staying at the level gave it that extra special touch and we felt spoilt. 
We had our own concierge reception all the staff were really welcoming and helpful. Rooms were lovely great view and everything u could need. Beds were really comfy and we loved all the technology in the room. 
The pool area was nice and the rooftop bar. 
Would definatly come back again, only to stay at the level tho of course.",5,2016,06,14
28,Great staff and service on The Level,"My husband and I recently stayed here during Primavera Sound festival with 2 other couples. We chose the hotel mainly because it was within walking distance of the festival location - which is on the outskirts of the city- and we were worried it would be impossible to get cabs back when we left the festival in the wee hours of the night (which turned out the case).  For that reason alone, this hotel was a perfect choice. In addition, though, the staff, service and amenities were all excellent.  If you opt to be on ""The Level"", you get more personalized service, access to a separate restaurant and cool outdoor lounge which are exclusively for The Level guests, free breakfast, snacks and beverages throughout the day and evening, and you can use the spa facilities for free.  During our stay, the staff frequently checked in to make sure that we had everything we needed and that we were satisfied with everything.  We ended up leaving some things in our room when we left and Miguel went out of his way to figure out the best and most economical means of shipping them back to us.  Would definitely recommend this hotel- and that you pay up to stay on The Level- and we will stay here again for sure if we return for Primavera Sound in 2017.",5,2016,06,13
28,Modern hotel w/great amenities & service!,"I stayed at The Level for four nights and we really enjoyed our stay. The Level is on the 25th floor of the building, and from the moment we checked in the service was wonderful. The Level includes a room with complimentary food and drinks, and we spent quite a bit of time there admiring the views of Barcelona with several glasses of Cava and some tapas. The room itself was a bit small but very modern - we loved the shower and the bed was quite comfortable with a pillow menu as well. I would warn people considering this hotel that the bathroom door is see-through glass and doesn't close all the way - which could prove a bit awkward for new couples/friends traveling together. The pool was beautiful as well, and we had a great couples massage at the Spa. It was about a 10 euro cab ride to the city center, and a 20-minute walk to the beach. We really enjoyed spending time on the Rambla del Poblenou, a cute street about a 5-minute walk from the hotel with some great restaurants, bars, and shops.",4,2016,06,05
28,Where Do I Start!!,"This hotel lived up to none of our expectations.
When we checked in and shown to our room it was boiling hot.  The room was ok but when you are melting it doesn't make you happy.  We asked the concierge on The Level to book a restaurant for us he was short and not friendly.  We couldn'tget in, he then told us to go to a certain area to eat which was terrible and not at all like the place I asked him to book.  The next morning at 8.10 there was extremely load drilling! Banging! and Hammering!! It felt like it was in the room next door.  I called The Level but they didn't seem too concerned, I then complained to the guest experience desk, they just said sorry and that they are renovating... After the 2nd morning of the same ridiculous noise and more complaining, I had to call  Mr and Mrs Smith to advise of this as the noise kept going all day.  Only then did the hotel move us to another room which was smaller, on a lower level we could still hear the noise but wasn't as loud.

They advise on flyers scattered around the hotel the sky bar is open until midnight on the first night we went up after dinner to have a drink at 10 is was shut....We then went at 7.30 before our dinner reservation the next night and were told by the barman he could serve us a beer or wine only as he was shutting at 8!!! and had no time to make any cocktails ...I said what type of wine he said they only had Chardonnay ... He was rude so we left...

At breakfast they constantly ran out of glasses...I asked for a coffee and was told twice there was a machine in the corner despite other tables getting coffee delivered to their table.

The bathrooms near the breakfast bar were really disgusting, they were like a public toilet on the street.

On another night we went to buy a bottle of wine to drink in our room at the bar and were advised they had only 1 type of wine!!!!

Needless to say we would NEVER stay here again or any other Melia hotel due to the blatant disregard for their guests happiness and needs.",1,2016,06,04
28,Level at Melia Sky a good stay,"Spent one night after a cruise. 

All in all a good hotel and value. The Level had a value if you have time to enjoy the amenities. We enjoyed it 

A modern hotel with a roof top pool, restaurant and a high level dining and drink area on the 24th floor",4,2016,06,01
28,Great place to stay,"We stayed at The Level for 5 days in July/August 2015. We had a sea view room which gave us a stunning vista of the Barcelona sea front. The room was of a good quality and we couldn't fault it. The bar area The Level inhabited had wonderful views of the city, and the food and drink there was regularly topped up - although the guests were like locusts as soon as more sandwiches arrived! We ate breakfast on the ground floor rather than at the The Level area as the choice was better. All in all, a great venue.",5,2016,05,29
28,Food,"We waited an hour for tapas, they brought one dish out which was mussells in a tin that smelt like cat food then brought the rest half an hour later... The potato's were hard and the bread was stale. Then charged us €40! Tried to refuse to pay  it they took the money off our hotel tab! Not happy",1,2016,05,25
28,"So-so hotel, too many rules and issues","We are currently staying in the Level Sky Melia. (Jump to the end for the bottom line) 

We are Canadians in our 30's who travel a lot. We prefer Mostly 4/5 star places but not extreme luxury. 

Our very 1st impression was one of an extremely moldy smell. Not just musty - mildew and lots of it. You can smell it throughout the hotel.

Rooms: we upgraded upon arrival (€50/night) to a suite and it is very nice.the air conditioning is not cold enough and it is set to not go below 16 degrees. (It was VERY hot at night and it was only May and about 18 outside)

Maid service: after 3 nights we still haven't had our room cleaned to our liking and have asked every day for them to remove our glasses from the night before. Also soaps and shower gels were not replenished either. 

Breakfast buffet: very nice spread, but by Wednesday it did seem like there wasn't enough food (or at least as much as Monday) the orange juice I had was off (soured) but everything else was good. 

Staff: overall it seems as if the hotel is operating on a skeleton crew. They are friendly but not very knowledgeable. The concierge recommended a tapas bar for us and when I asked if it would be open on a Sunday he said yes. We walked all the way there and it was closed. When I mentioned it to him the next day he was rude and defensive.

There was also an incident where my husband and I were in the spa and emergency personnel came running into the steam room thinking someone had pressed the emergency button. 
They then accused us of leaving the steam room door open and it was our fault!! We hadn't been in there at all. 

The Level: open until 11pm they have free drinks (wine, beer and spirits) and some very light snacks. Food and drink must be consumed in the level (floor 25) which is a bit inconvenient if you just wanted to finish a glass of wine or whatnot. It does have nice views of the city.
Along with level club includes free entry to the steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and gym. 

Spa: great sauna, eucalyptus steam room. The jacuzzi was not hot enough but large.

Pool: the pool is not heated and was freezing. It does get sun until around 5:30 (late may) but the bar was closed. Absolutely no staff in sight and the lights were even out in the lobby.

Terrace bar: also running with only 1 staff member. Zero ambiance except for the nice view. Closed early at 8:00 instead of 12:00 as listed 

Neighbourhood: lovely Poblenou area away from the action. Take the tram in either direction straight down Diagonal av. 15 mins. 
5 min walk away is los ramblas de Poblenou - great pedestrian avenue with restaurants, not as touristy as the larger La ramblas near the centre. 

Les Glories shopping centre is across the street on av diagonal about 5 mins away. Very nice. 

Bottom line: 

We enjoyed being away from the centre and the crazy crowds, but I wouldn't bother coming to this hotel again. There's a Sheraton next door. Would try that instead.",3,2016,05,24
28,Perfect birthday weekend!,"In celebration of a milestone birthday, was treated by my husband to a weekend at the Level at Melia Barcelona Sky.  From beginning to end, we were treated like VIPs by the team, receiving impeccable customer service from all members, but one in particular, Yolanda, stood out. A huge thank you to the team for the surprise chocolate cake for my birthday!

Check in was held in the Level Lounge on the 25th floor, where we were warmly greeted and offered complimentary cava and tapas while waiting and enjoying panoramic views of the city.  The lounge is exclusively for the use of those staying at the Level and offers complimentary continental breakfast. For a full breakfast, the hotel restaurant on the ground floor offers a buffet with a good variety of the usual hot and cold breakfast foods. 

If like us, you opt for a room with a city view, views of the seaside can be found on the terrace of the restaurant on the 24th floor. Back in the room, the plush slippers and robe & beautifully scented toiletries give it a spa-like feel. 

The hotel is located in a less touristy neighborhood, El Poblenou. A stroll down Rambla de Poblenou will take you to cafes frequented by locals, and at the end, you'll arrive at the beach. A short cab ride will take you to La Sagrada Familia and other interesting sites.

Highly recommend this hotel for a weekend break.

28,The Level ,"Great concept of providing a concierge level service . Loved the drinks and snacks available all day ,and the late checkout available on request is very helpful .
The service the team provides at the level  is of a high standard ,they are so helpful with any enquiry .
The free access to pool and spa is also a great touch .
 ",4,2016,05,13
28,Another excellent stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights in April, arriving on my husband's birthday. He was delighted to find a nice chocolate cake and bottle of Freixenet in an ice bucket in the room on our arrival so thank you! Check in on The Level was smooth and quick, with a nice glass of chilled cava brought to us. This is our second stay and we knew what to expect and we really love this hotel. The staff on The Level are lovely: professional, well-groomed and helpful in every way. Again, all of the facilities were tip top: lovely pool area and cushioned beds, breakfast (which we took in the downstairs restaurant all 3 mornings because of the wider choice) absolutely lovely with fresh pastries, fruit, cooked items, serrano ham, cheese, juices, various coffees, the room was very clean and spacious with fab views (16th floor), and spa/treatment rooms/gym. The Level would get really busy in the evenings but there was always plenty to eat in the way of tapas and cake, and good quality cava and beers available till 11pm. This hotel is near the train station and has a lot of bars nearby and from it you can walk to Port Olympic. We will certainly be back and thank you to Yolande, what a lovely lady.",5,2016,05,08
28,Modern comfortable hotel ,"Stayed here between Christmas and New Year. I would describe this as an affordable Plush modern hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the room was compact but lovely. Big spacious powerful shower. Automatic black out curtains and great views over the city. 

The reception and hotel staff were really accommodating and helped us to find our way around the local area and how to get into the city. It's located just a few blocks from the metro and then only a 10 minute journey into the centre. It was a great location for us and I imagine in the summer months even better as its close to the beach as well. 
",4,2016,05,01
28,The Level At Melia Barcelona,"Just returned from a 4 night stay and would recommend this hotel. 

Just a short walk to the metro with easy links on the metro from many of the sites across the city. 32 euros for 5 days unlimited travel across all the transport links including the train from the airport which takes around 20/25 minutes is a great way to see the sights. 

Stayed in a city view room on the 16th floor which had great views and from the right room (including the level lounge) you can see the Sagrada Familia which is a must on any trip to Barcelona

The level lounge is great for a drink and something to nibble at any time of the day especially the cava when you first arrive! The spirits even come out later on in the night!
The staff in the level are always available to assist and re-printed our boarding passes without hesitation. 

Eat breakfast down stairs as the lounge had less chose and could get busy and was it more than pleasant with a good selection of hot and cold food and drinks. 

Also visited the local Poblenou Ramblas which had many nice places to eat for Spanish food including Passeig Nine for tapas and El Capritx for Paella 

Plus for a change the huge pizza at Il Grillo was fantastic

Overall would recommend this hotel and a lot of work is being done to update the area of Poblenou including the park across from the hotel.

28,Excellent! Probably best hotel I've ever stayed at,"Loved this hotel!! Everything is in there. We stayed in the nice room with an amazing city view (big windows) on the top floor. Room interior is very unusual and lovely. Tea/coffee machine is available, shower amenities are from the fancy brand Loewe. Drinks/snacks for free in the evening on the top floor! Although it was autumn when we were there, we enjoyed our stay! Will definitely come back to try the swimming pool! ",5,2016,04,25
28,Fantastic hotel,"On a girly weekend break and had THE most amazing time here. From the cocktail bar mixed by Alvaro (my life the best cocktails I've ever tasted!) to the amazing team at the level, especially Yolanda who chose and arranged the best restaurants to eat at. Basically we've had  the most amazing weekend and would do it all exactly the same in a heartbeat! An atmosphere of sophistication & exclusivity without any stuffiness. The perfect equilibrium!",5,2016,04,24
28,"Great weekend, sun and sangria ","Stayed here with a friend for a long weekend. On arrival we had some confusion over our booking but was sorted quickly. Hotel was very clean, staff were very friendly. We had a sea view on the 16th amazing view. The breakfast was included and there was a great variety... You must going up to the 25th floor (if you like heights). Would certainly come back to this hotel again. ",4,2016,04,23
28,Best hotel ever <3,"We already stayed 2 times in this hotel.  First time 2 years ago, last time in november and are planning to come again really soon.  If you know we usually never stay in the same hotel again, I guess you can say we really love this place... First time we visited we booked a room on the level floors but got an upgrade to a suite.  We didn't know that and only noticed this last november when we booked a room and this was smaller than on our first visit.  However, although it was smaller views are still breathtaking. And service is the same. We stayed in a room with city view first time and last time got the sea view. Both are stunning, but we prefer the city view. Breakfast downstairs is very busy, but very complete. At the lounge there's less choice, but very relaxed. The staff is very friendly and helps with everything you need to know, how to get around Barcelona, looking for a nice restaurant etc... Drinks and snacks in the lounge are very good, with always an open bottle of cava, wine, gin tonic, tortilla, macarons, cake,  coffee...
I really recommend this hotel and hope to be there again soon :)",5,2016,04,22
28,Really excellent service. and non-stop smiles,"We went this  past weekend with my wife for our anniversary getaway, the room was on the 20th floor.The view was breathtaking and so was the facilities of our room.

The best of everything was the staff, as they all tried to make you welcome at every turn.
From Ferran at reception that handled every query or complaint with the utmost professionalism, Milos our waiter that catered for our every need, and finally Renatta who welcomed us with the best coffee and smile we could ever ask for early in the morning ..

Thank you all, you made our stay absolutely unforgettable, we will definitely see you again soon......

The only part which we didn't like too much was the spa facilities, as one of the massage showers didn't work and we tried to tell the lady at the spa reception, but she didn't seem to bothered, I would recommend a little maintenance in that area,,,Otherwise it would have been 5 stars all round",4,2016,04,14
28,Amazing Service and Everything you could want!,"We booked this Hotel to stay at the beginning of our trip to celebrate my 30th Birthday.  Before flying out to Barcelona, the Melia Sky had emailed me requesting if there was anything that I needed upon my arrival, that would make my stay and travel easier. 

From the point of arriving to the point of leaving the service received was top quality and I only wish all hotels went to the lengths they did to provide the top quality service.

Mistakingly we did decided to break the trip up and stay at a hotel near the beach W Barcelona, this was a HUGE mistake.  I only regret was not staying at the Melia sky for the whole 4 nights we had booked away. 

On the last day we didn't want to come home so we changed our flights and re-booked with the Melia Sky to stay for one more night again. 

The 25th floor with its own lounge and free drinks (nice ones, not the nasty cheap type!), is a brilliant touch and enjoyed thoroughly with great views over the city.

We look forward to visiting again soon and will 100% be staying for the whole trip at Melia Sky.

Thanks Melia sky and its team for making it a wonderful experience.",5,2016,04,14
28,Excellent Service,"Melia has great staff, especially the guys that man the level on the 25th floor and the Customer Experience desk. 

We were there for a celebratory weekend and the level of care, attention to detail exceeded our expectations. E.g I asked them to try to source a red-velvet cake, and the staff arranged for it to be baked for us ready for the big day! When we asked to change our room, they put us up in a sea-view suite so lovely we didn't want to leave :) :) It's little things like that that made our stay so wonderful. 

I highly recommend it. They're making some renovations to the hotel, which is good as it does have some signs of wear but none the less, it is a great hotel and the staff are the real stars of this impressive place. 

Definitely going back soon

28,Minimoon in Barcelona,"We had our minimoon in Barcelona at the start of April, and chose The Level at Melia Sky as we had an amazing holiday at Red Level at the Melia Hotel in Tenerife the year before.  
The Level (and Red Level) are far better experiences than your normal hotel, the lounge is excellent for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing, whether that's having a drink or reading a book.  There is free drinks from 7am-11pm, and food is regularly refreshed throughout this time, in fact we didn't go out for dinner on one of the nights as we chose to just stay in the lounge!  
As it was our minimoon, the hotel left a massive slab of cake in our room which was a nice touch, and there was also free access in the spa for all Level guests.  The spa has a sauna, steam room and jacuzzi and also treatments on offer (which you need to pay for).  It was fine, not the best spa I have ever been to but still fine for a freebie!
The differences between Barcelona The Level and Tenerife's Red Level was that kids were allowed in The Level, whereas Red Level was adults only.  The staff at Melia Sky did their best to quieten down but some were still quite noisy - not the hotels fault though so I can't mark them down for that!
Dos Cielos is one of the restaurants within the hotel and is Michelin Starred, so we went there for one of the evenings, I can recommend this highly, the food and service was incredible and compared to UK Michelin Star restaurants, very reasonable
As the weather was fairly bad, we didn't use the pool, we went outside to have a look at it, and i imagine in warmer weather this would be a nice place to lie out in the sun.
The area where the hotel is situated is 5 or 6 stops on the Metro from the main area of the city, and so you will need a travel card to get around.  The surrounding area is a little run down and you would be hard pressed to find a really nice bar or restaurant to spend an evening - but then you can do this in the hotel anyway.
All in all, I would recommend The Level @ Melia Sky",4,2016,04,12
28,Very memorable break,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. It was our first visit to Barcelona. We were given a very warm welcome at the main reception but were surprised to find we had to go to the 25th floor to check in. We soon realised that this was a very special place as we were warmly welcomed with a chilled Cava and light refreshments. Our room on the 27th floor was excellent with amazing views from the floor to ceiling windows over the city and foothills of the Pyrenees. Probably not a good place to stay if you suffer from vertigo! The room was very comfortable - excellent sized bed, great shower and very comfortable surroundings. Also Espresso machine for coffee. Excellent service if you ran out of coffee or milk ( a phone call to reception brought what you needed to the room. One of the high points of the hotel were the freely available hot and cold drinks ( eg red and white wine, cava, beers etc) and delicious snacks available from 7 am to 11 pm on the 25th floor. All the staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful but a particular mention goes to Yolande who booked tickets for us for some of the sites and also arranged - cava on ice and strawberries dipped in chocolate to be put in our room to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  We did investigate the restaurant (Michelin star) on the 24th floor but it was very booked up - mind you the fixed menu at 110 euros was rather outside our budget but the food looked very good. Breakfast was available on the 25th floor (Continental breakfast) or on the ground floor (Full, cooked breakfast). We tried the ground floor and there was a very good selection of food but found it very busy and service variable.  We had all our dishes cleared away mid-breakfast, while we were searching our next course. We used the 25th floor for future breakfasts and that was great - although less choice but food still excellent - it was very un-rushed and tranquil with personal service from Yolande included.The hotel is on the east side of the city so a little way from some of the main sites - however a nearby metro Poublenou soon got you to the centre and there were local buses and a tram - so not a problem. There were lots of taxis outside the hotel if you needed them.  We found a lot of reasonably priced restaurants in Las Ramblas de Poublenou about ten minutes walk away and enjoyed several good meals there. The beach is also reasonably close about 15 -20 minutes walk but well worth the walk. In conclusion, our stay at The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky was a fantastic experience. A very big thank you to all the staff who made our stay so memorable.",5,2016,04,11
28,Ideal,"I recommend this hotel highly but a couple of pointers for anyone thinking of visiting is probably worth noting. So the level is so worth the stay just for the views alone, the weather was beautiful, we had a sea view room & waking up in the morning on the 17th floor to floor to ceiling windows onto the city was absolutely unreal. 

The staff were friendly and they have a great concierge service that even press elevator buttons for you!! It's helpful that you can just press 0 from your phone in your room and speak to reception with any queries and they send someone up to save the trip down! The room we had was ideal, the lighting is really cool all round with dimmers and mood lighting, the bathroom is clean with a really large mirror and lots of space! 

Our room was cleaned twice a day pristinely, they check the mini bar each time to work out what you've taken. The mini bar is not as expensive as we thought as we rinsed it on the first night!! However be careful as the previous guests drank the wine and refilled the bottles with water! But again, the staff were great and did not charge us. 

Las ramblas & port vell with the beach are 15 euros away with a taxi rank literally as you step out the door. Otherwise the hotel area is pretty quiet. 

If you are staying at the level with access to the lounge please be aware you have free drinks & breakfast in the lounge on floor 25!! We were not told this so spent €40 on our first night on 4 drinks as the hotel is expensive!!! We only realised on our 2nd night, so take advantage! 

Only really bad part of our trip was the hotel restaurant on the ground floor 'the place' - absolutely diabolical food, we had our meals bought out twice as the burgers were cold in the middle, literally cold when you put your hand on it & it didn't improve the second time around so we paid for neither and ordered room service instead. For the price it is crazy. However there is a second restaurant on the 24th floor that was booked every night and we ordered room service from, so we assume is much much better!! 

All in all I think the hotel is beautiful and lived up to my expectations, easy to get around with really modern, tech rooms, for two 21 year olds on a weekend break it was ideal, with a gym and wellness centre and everything so close by we couldn't have asked for much better! (And also the robes and slippers you get are probably the best thing ever!!)

28,Modern Hotel and Great Staff,We stayed at this hotel for two nights. We were greeted in the reception area on the 25rd floor with a glass of cava and by Manuel.  He was the first of many excellent members of staff we dealt with.  All staff members were very knowledgeable and very welcoming and speak English.The accommodation was clean and modern.  Toiletries were very nice.  Beds and pillows were very comfortable and were supplied with cashmere blankets and scatter cushions!!  Lots of nice touches; not least the complimentary snacks and drinks in the reception area on the 25th floor.  Hotel is sited a bit out of the way of the main sights in Barcelona but taxis are in plentiful supply (taxi rank is immediately outside the hotel lobby) and there is always the metro/bus/tram for economic travel and sightseeing.  Would go back again.,5,2016,04,06
28,Loved this place,"We stayed here for my birthday first week of April, as soon as we arrived we were asked to go to a separate check in upstairs and both given a glass of cava, and shown to our room on the 23rd floor. We had a lovely room can't fault it was very clean, comfy bed and a beautiful view.
The staff are all fantastic always a friendly hola or hello from them all.
Special mention to Jeorge and Yousel who both went above and beyond to make sure my birthday was a special one and it was thanks guys will see you soon.",5,2016,04,05
28,Great get away,"We had a fantastic 4 nights stay at the Level. I booked for the grand premium with the sea view to celebrate my husband’s birthday. The room located on 23th floor and the view was much better than I was expected. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, loved the day-bed by the window.  Nice touch on the iPhone docking station. The room required a bit of updating. The floor has seen better days, noisy air-condition which completely broke down on our last day. There aren’t a lot of hot food selections for the breakfast but it was plentiful to choose from breads, pastries, cheeses, cured meats, fruits and cakes. The level lounge has fantastic view especially at night when the city lit up. We can see the Sagrada Familia from there. 
The location wise, I felt let down when we arrived at the hotel initially. However once we get to know the neighbourhood, we fall in love. The hotel is closed to the underground station and buses and trams are just around the corner. It is very quiet area around the hotel but after a few minutes’ walk to the Poblenou’s Ramblas, the area become lively. There are many shops, café and restaurants. We always use the Ramblas to walk down to the beach.
The only disappointment was that on our last day, the air-condition was broken down. We were planning to stay in the room on that day. It was the warmest day since we arrived in Barcelona and the room was so warm we couldn’t stay in the room. We had notified the level reception the night before but no one came to check in the morning. After fourth attempts, the serviceman came to check and told us that we will need to change the room. By the time Yolanda kindly moved us to the Excutive room, it was already 3pm and my husband wasn’t happy bunny to move the room. 
All in all, I would say the hotel is four stars rather five stars and we will be staying there again and recommend to our friends.",4,2016,04,03
28,Excellent service so we spent every evening at The Level,"The Level is a lounge that has a reception desk and complimentary drinks and snacks.
All the staff are exceptionally polite, helpful and friendly and we were made to feel very welcome on arrival and for the duration of our stay.
The snacks available are sandwiches, canapés, nuts, olives, cakes and sweets. Both the red and white wine are very tasty, we didn't try the Prosecco. The beer is Campocruz and spirits are put out in the evening.
The lounge is intimate and sitting there enjoying the view from the 25th floor is a total contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city. We enjoyed it there so much that we ended up staying in The Level every evening!",5,2016,03,28
28,Perfect,"Arrived for a surprise 40th for my wife. At downstairs reception was told that ""we have a separate reception for our 5 star guests"" Boom...My husband stock went up 3000%! 
Once in seperate reception offered a glass of cava, which was a nice touch. 
On arriving at the room we were greeted with a bottle of chilled cava and a chocolate birthday cake and a hand written note wishing my wife a happy birthday. 
Absolutely top class. Thank you.",5,2016,03,25
28,Love the view and lounge bar,The view and the food at the lounge bar were fabulous! The room design was chic and the bed was very comfy. I left cash and credit cards in the safe after I checked out but the staffs were kind enough to destroy my credit cards and wire my money back to my home account internationally. Would love to stay there if I go to Barcelona again! It's worth every penny.,5,2016,03,19
28,"Great views, great staff","A very enjoyable stay.  The hotel is designed for views and these are good.  The room was well equipped, beds very comfortable and all the facilities.  Just a little worn at the edges.  The Lounge on level 25 is a superb facility, with very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff.  The spa looked amazing, though we didn't use it - we missed out there.  Five minutes from a Metro station and a minute from buses on a major artery it is a decent base for Barcelona.  Plus - Staff; minus - room needing update/refresh.",4,2016,03,15
28,Intoxicatingly seductive,"From the moment you walk in to the minute you leave. The Melia Sky is excellent. The service, the attention to detail and the way in which the whole team treat you are second to none. Almost wanting to be better constantly. It's literally a definition of superiority that engages every sinus of their being. 

It's my second stay here and the experience had improved immeasurably both times which I thought would be impossible. 

From the General Manager Marc to Yolanda in the level to the ladies and gents who are continually ready to support and assist to your every whim, the experience was and is nailed to perfection. 

I experienced every facet of the hotel and was impressed with them all. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Melia Sky and particularly the level experience. I felt like I could stay here forever, continual being treated like a king.

A special mention for Catalina who on my previous visit was unbelievably supportive, sympathetic and crucially empathetic. 

My two stays are 8 months apart in total. Shockingly all key members of the Melia team I encountered on my first stay remembered me too. It's genuinely impressive when you consider the sheer volume of people who stay in this hotel week in week out.

Stay here. It will not be a regret. As for me, a hotel isn't necessarily about whether the sink had a chip in it or not but how you're treated, how you're left feeling and crucially how you're made to feel.

The Melia Sky. Take a bow. Thank you. ",5,2016,02,20
28,Great people great hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights and it was the best one on our Euro trip. The staff were fantastic and couldn't help us enough. We stayed on the 28 floor, the room was huge and very tidy. This hotel has the most amazing views of the city. It is a wee way from the main tourist center but it's costs about 8 euro to get right in the center of it all. In saying that there is plenty of restaurants and shops in short walking distance around the area.",5,2016,02,17
28,A good hotel with fabulous staff,"We stayed for a weekend in a Junior suite on 27th floor, to celebrate my husband's birthday.

Positives: Great views, great size room, great location.

The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the nearest metro (10 minutes you'll be in the centre). A 5 minute walk from the local Rambla del Poblenou, a pedestrianised street down to the beach filled with bars, restaurants, shops etc. We spent our first evening wandering down the Rambla to the beach (15 minute walk) and stumbled across a fantastic tapas bar (el 58). All in all a great neighbourhood, and not touristy. An excellent start!

Negatives: Badly chipped sink in bathroom, badly marked floor in living room (I relocated the rug to cover them up!!), the window into the bathroom to watch your partner use the toilet!!! (we averted eyes!!) 

We had a room with a city view, which meant we were looking onto the block of apartments being built, complete with crane. My advice would be to request a sea view !! There was also some construction noise (drills, hammers) from 9am Saturday morning. We phoned the Level reception and it was stopped. 

(I got the impression that generally there was work going on to update the hotel, as from the Sunday, the interior walls were being painted and flooring was being worked on)

All in all, nothing which significantly spoiled our stay.

The Level : Fantastic service!! Open 7am til 11pm. The choice of continental breakfast, followed by various snacks, tapas, cheeses etc. during the day. The option of wines, cava, gin etc. The staff were incredibly helpful and polite. Nothing was too much trouble. They booked us flamenco reservations and advised us on visiting Gaudi houses. The staff are definitely the hotel's best asset. Same with the staff at reception on the 4th floor and at breakfast. Wonderful.

The private lounge was superb. Check-in and check out was smooth. 

Additionally, it was my husband's birthday and the staff (after a gentle reminder) placed a gift of birthday cake and cava in our room. 

Overall, a good hotel with fabulous staff. I would recommend it.",4,2016,02,15
28,Nice hotel,"The hotel located a bit farther than the tourist area 
The hotel is well designed and cleaned 
At the time of my stay they had some construction going on and no one had told us about it until we had to change elevator at 4th floor every time we want to go out when I complained about it at my checkout they made a discount of my final bill which is nice of them. 
They wanted to charge me 4 Euros for bucket of ice ( they have free ice on reception) 
The host at Breakfest ( Nadia) was very nice she was asking my pregnant wife what she want the next day for Breakfest and provided her with her choices. 

Nadia we thank you so much 
Level hotel thank you ",4,2016,02,11
28,My worst experience of a Melia hotel as a Melia Rewards member,"We stayed at Melia Sarria in Barcelona last January and it was a very nice experience. We decided to stay in this hotel this year as it looked nice on the web site despite some poor comments on Tripadvisor. I wished I have taken notice of these comments. This is not a 5 stars hotel by some distance. We arrived yesterday and the experience so far is underwhelming. Our bedroom is not in a good condition. The bedroom floor and the bathroom sink surround badly marked. The fine dinning restaurant is closed for refurbishment but was not mentioned on the website. When I mentioned this to the Level manager today she just shrugged her shoulders.

My advice is choose Melia Sarria if you want to stay in another Melia hotel. It will cost more but is worth it.",2,2016,01,23
28,"Although a little frayed at the edges, still a great hotel","Stayed here for a long weekend (Wedding Anniversary) and loved the place.
The staff are consummate professionals with a never ending smile and abundant hospitality.
The hotel is modern and contemporary and although just 8 years old is in need of some TLC. The rooms are large and very well appointed with great views out of the floor to ceiling windows. Be warned if you are claustrophobic though, as there are no stairs just banks of lifts.
The Executive Junior suites have a great sea view.
We only ate breakfast at The Levels buffet restaurant and found it delicious.
You are 5 minutes walk away from the main street in Poblenou which offers plenty of eating/drinking establishments.
We intend to go back bak again soon",5,2016,01,12
28,Very Good  service It  is very nice 4**** Superior  but  not a 5*****.,"The  level floor  is certainly great  experience, I booked The level grand premium sea view and  the  view  was  fantastic. The VIP Lounge  has a great  selection of  snacks pity  that is closing  so early and  is not converted into a night bar for VIP clients  that  could have been  a  source  of income  for the Hotel.
The rooms on the Level  floor are  good  but  not 5***** the  flooring and  rooms  need  some renovation ,and my believe is  that Melia  will initiate renovation very soon.
The  SPA very nice touch  but is closing very early at 21:00pm
The  staff  at the Level  floor  was very  helpful and sweet, I will  certainly  return Melia Level Barcelona.",4,2016,01,11
28,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff but something lacking","I stayed here over NYE (in Dec 2015) with 4 of my friends. We had spacious rooms with a seperate living and dressing area. The standard of the rooms were good, but the finishing wasn't to a 5* standard. The sink and shower in our bathroom was very worn out and there were chips in the tiles. The shower door didnt fully close but it wasn't a bid deal. 
The breakfast was very disappointing with a limited range of food. However, if you stay The Level  you have access to the reception on the 25th floor which served complimentary food and drink (soft and alcoholic) all day, which was great! 
Overall, the saff were very friendly and helpful, especially Gonzales!
The spa was facilities weren't as good as expected. There is a steam room, sauna and small jacuzzi. 
The hotel is about a 6 min walk away from Poble Nou Metro station which was well connected to the rest of the city. 
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to those who don't want to stay too close to La Ramblas.",4,2016,01,06
28,Superb ,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for two nights over NY and had a fantastic time. The Level itself is a great wee space to grab a snack or a beer and the room was absolutely superb. Could not find a fault. They pride themselves on offering a bespoke and customer based experience and they certainly surpassed my expectations. The receptionist recommended a phenomenal local restaurant and all the other tourist info we were given was dead handy.

If visiting Barcelona, and want to stay in a nice hotel, I think you'd be hard pushed to beat the Melia. We shall hopefully be returning someday!

",5,2016,01,03
28,WOW amazing views and friendly helpful staff,"We arrived at the hotel and was greater by a friendly staff team. When we got there we presumed we would just have to wait for our room as our flight was earlier and check in wasn't till 3pm but the receptionist told us we was in a different section of the hotel and proceeded to take our bags of us and in to the lift up to the 24th floor. We was then greeted by another friendly member of the team who invited us in to the luxury lounge area to get us all checked in. Me and my partner were amazed thinking we had got the wrong hotel as next we was offered cava or any other drink we would like whilst she organised our room and gave us information about Barcelona.the receptionist was always happy to help with anything especially sight seeing and finding your way around. We was told the Lounge was all inclusive for our stay drinks and snacks! And the views from it was spectacular. We had a short 15 minuet wait and our room was ready. Our room was on the 28th floor with a city view. We walked in and it was amazing you could see  tibidabo mountain and for miles, luxury king size bed mini bar walk in shower and more. It was clean and we couldn't have Been happier. We only had breakfast once in the hotel due to our travel times but it was lovely with a wide range of options. Easy access to the underground which was just around the corner and within walking distance to jump on the city tour bus,Taxi rank right out side the hotel so was able to explore the delights of Barcelona easily. Would definitely  stay here again and would recommend it to any one wanting a trip to Barcelona!",5,2015,12,18
28,Very nice but not quite 5*,"Stayed here for 3 nights in December 15 in a junior suite, and it's hard to fault the place. 

The staff were always helpful and polite (even too an American couple we overheard complaining the room didn't have enough air in), and the free bar on the 25th floor allows you free alcohol and food whenever you want which is always a nice luxury! 

It's located outside the centre, but you can easily walk to the main attractions, took us about 30 minutes to get the sagrada familia where we then walked from to the main old town and port and finally back to the hotel. In fact we didn't need to get public transport or a taxi once! 

There is a road a minutes walk away which has tons of incredible restaurants on at very reasonable prices compared to the touristy places and we had all our meals here (see other reviews).

Room was very nice, but, the reason this isn't getting five stars is the fact despite the great view, the rooms seemed a bit dated. The sink was all chipped, there was no bath curtain which meant you could see straight through from the main room to whoever was on the toilet. The speakers also only worked iPhone 4 and old phones/iPods. 

Would recommend though and would definitely stay again ",4,2015,12,16
28,Lovely hotel and great service.,"I work for a travel agency in London where I frequently visit different hotels across Barcelona and I have to say The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky is the best I have visited to date. From the moment I arrived, the staff were so friendly and helped with anything I needed. From recommendations of places to helping us get from place to place, they were fantastic. The hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and is a 2 minute walk from the metro system.

It was a fantastic weekend and I will definitely be visiting back there in the future.

28,Excellent Weekend away,"We (my mother and I ) arrived and were escorted upstairs to The Level concierge desk and enjoyed a leisurely check-in process with a glass of prosecco.  We were then shown to our room (on 20th floor) which had a lovely city view of the Sagrada Familia and Park Guell.  The room was well appointed - Nespresso coffee machine, mini-bar, floor to ceiling windows with electric opening curtains/blackout blinds, in fact everything seemed to have a button to control it somewhere!  A huge rainshower, big comfortable beds, lovely decor throughout.  The spa was lovely too, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna etc.  The Level lounge was available throughout the day with light bites & drinks which were complimentary, made even better by the beautiful city view.  We ate in the hotel's downstairs restaurant one night, food was lovely.  Extensive range of gins behind the bar so we enjoyed working through the cocktail list!  All the staff were polite and very helpful.  Thank you Melia!",5,2015,12,15
28,Great views and service,"We booked a level room at the Melia hotel for a weekend getaway. The staff was fantastic and their service exceeded expectations. The level lounge (food and drinks all day)  was better than we thought it would be. Our room needed some upgrading, but the view was fantastic. We will book this hotel again. The indoor pool was nice, but not very warm.",5,2015,12,08
28,Barcelona's best place to stay !,"From the moment we arrived we knew this was going to be a very good hotel. 

We booked on line direct with The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky. We selected a room at the Level for the additional privileges. And these started check in. You check in at their private lounge on the 25th floor. We were welcomed  by Miguel García-Romanillos, the Level Manager, with glasses of wine and spectacular views of the city.
Miguel provided amazing service and is a great member of the team. Full of local knowledge and recommendations to help us during our stay

Our room was Junior suite. Big open plan room. Great views of the city. Bed and pillows extremely comfy – just what you need after a full day sightseeing ! A nice touch was the nespresso machine in the room to have the use of. 2 TV’s to choose from (his & hers!) and a speaker system to connect your IPhone  up to.

We had the opportunity to use the Spa in the hotel. Hot tub, steam and sauna. All part of the benefits with a Level room. This was very good, stylish, clean and not too big to make it over crowded. A welcome relief on sore legs after a day of walking the city !

We used the Level lounge a number of times. Mid morning, mid afternoon recovery, pre dinner drinks. Whenever we went, it was always full with drinks and snacks. All of high quality. Mid afternoon cakes and Cava a real popular choice ! Again the service by the team here was excellent. Always very polite, friendly and happy to help.
You can have breakfast at the Level, but we decided to eat in downstairs. The choice was buffet, from hot and cold food, to cereals and cakes. A vast choice and really set us up for a full day sightseeing !

Location – It’s not in the busy city centre, so you have to tube or taxi. But who wants to stay in a busy, noisy, overpriced city hotel when you can stay the Melia Sky instead. You are only a 5 min walk to the nearest tube – Poble Nou. From here it’s a direct line to the main stations. We found it the best option. Easy to get around, but the welcome sanctuary of a nice hotel in a quiet part of town. We took a short 10 min walk up Av. Diagonal, along the pedestrian boulevard to Glories shopping centre.

I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a luxury stay in Barcelona. The service from the staff and the facilities absolutely make this hotel.",5,2015,12,07
28,Very balanced hotel with great service and tasy food!,"Positive
Gym is available 24/7, typical light hotel gym.. don’t expect any heavy weights etc…
Internet very good for a hotel!
Food is quite good, although pricey for Barcelona!
The level includes an all-day open bar&food! Basic snacks and drinks but will patch you if you are in a hurry! It’s on the 25th floor and the view is quite impressive!
And the best part is the SERVICE! The staff there was really helpful and understanding

Negative points:
Windows do not open, no fresh air, your only option is the aircon
If you tend to work on the provided desk the light is very weak, not sufficient for reading paper!
The rooms with city view have NO bathrooms! For a 4-5* hotel it’s a bit odd!
SPA only opens at 11AM too late if you are a morning person!",5,2015,12,04
28,Attended a conference hope to return as a tourist.,"Great hotel, breakfast, and restaurants.  Here is an important tip.  Upgrade yourself to a Jr. Suite or a suite.  Ask about access to the Level Lounge.  It includes a day long munchie buffet with wine and champagne.  I did breakfast there because it was quick and easy and great selections.  And in the evening it was quiet, faster than the restaurants and the perfect spot to get through the evening munchies.",4,2015,11,29
28,Short break to Barcelona,"Stayed at the the level 6th November for three nights . The staff were attentive and helpful . We had a couple of problems with the room on arrival which were promptly sorted . Good range of snacks and drinks in lounge , small black flys hovering around pastries though ! Probably better covered . Restaurant food excellent . Coffee at breakfast not to my taste , lovely Scottish lass working at breakfast . Would stay again but found Red Level experience in Madrid better . ",4,2015,11,18
28,Sky is the limit,"That's right, as said in other review, in the room, xou will find scratches, little stains and little things that doesn't help to make a sense of pure 5 stars luxury....
But...
I my opinion, this is the best ratio price vs quality that you can get in Barcelona.
The lounge is always refilled with drinks and finger food. Alcool is also available all day long, not only in a couple of hours, let it be in Hilton for example.
I have really enjoyed the personalized service and the friendliness of the staff.
I had an incredible rate of 106euros for a city view room on the 27th floor, breakfast and lounge access included. I was able to check-in at 13h00 without any surcharge.

I really liked the nice slippers and the Loewe bath products in the bathroom.
The view from the bed over the city was really beautiful, I could see the Agbar tower, the Sagrada Familia, Tibidao Castle... In my opinion, city view is better than sea view...
The room was really huge. I have read in other review that the room was small... We were not in the same hotel I guess. Also had espresso machine in the room.

The staff at the lounge couldn't have been more helpful for reserving a restaurant (7 Portes, which I highly recommend too), handing out a map and explaining me what to see over a short week-end.
Also good recommendation for public tranport.
Metro is a 4-minutes-walk away and there's Gracies comercial center 10 minutes away.

I also stayed at the Hilton Barcelona on Diagonal, which has poorer service, less personalized, restricted service in the lounge and smaller rooms and no swimming pool...

Let's go again to the Level @ Melia Barcelona Sky, where it seems, that the limit for the service is... the sky!",5,2015,11,16
28,"Great value for money, fantastic service.","The hotel is slightly outside of the gothic neighburhoods (where most of the tourists stay), however is only a five minute walk from Poble nou underground station and the area itself is full of lovely cafes and restaurants and about 10 minutes from the beach. 
I traveled with my girlfriend and we were very impressed with the service and the attention to detail. For somebody that does not frequently pay for 5 star hotels, for the money paid, this hotel is well worth it. However, i can imagine if you are accustomed to such hotels, there is some room for improvement e.g. scuffs on the floor, erratic shower temperatures, etc, however with such an amazing city to explore, these annoyances fade into irrelevance. Complementary snacks and soft/alcoholic drinks (branded stuff too!) along with the incredibly helpful reception staff made our stay a fantastic experience.",5,2015,11,15
28,3 Night Stay,"We stayed for 3 nights on the Level floor, it was exceptional, the service was wonderful all the extras they give is well worth the price. Would Stay again, highly recommend. There is a park across the street but there are not many restaurants close by, the restaurant at the hotel was closed on Sundays and Mondays. A fifteen minute walk to the beach. Pat",5,2015,11,10
28,4 nights here with the best views of Barcelona,"We stayed here for 4 nights with the best views of Barcelona.

The 'Level' part of the hotel is great. Full views of the city whilst helping yourself to little nibbles and coffee / wine / cava for free :)

Rooms are of a high enough quality, and were cleaned every day, extremely well. We even got a chocolate to come back to each night on the bed :)

Cannot complaint for the price paid, the location and the staff and food - We have to give it a solid 5 stars. Will return here next time we come to Barcelona for sure.
Even looking into their other 'The Level' hotels around the world now ....",5,2015,11,10
28,Amazing 60th break away,"Loved this hotel, great value, great location, great experience,,, the staff were friendly and helpful, the views from every window were spectacular and the complimentary cava and canapés were second to none, would love to visit again",5,2015,11,07
28,"Two nights stay, Astonishing view from this Hotel",This Hotel is a very modern one apart from the city center. Surroundings were peaceable by night. Service was brilliant and very professional. The best thing there was the astonishing view from this Hotel.,4,2015,11,04
28,"One night stay, Amazing value for Luxury hotel","The level is great value for money! Lovely rooms, big comfy King beds, amazing views from the room and best of all from 7am-11pm there is a lounge with access to Coffee, wines, beers, soft drinks and food. They serve breakfast, snacks, lunch items and nice desserts around dinner time. All included in the price.

The personal reception is a great touch and the team there are happy to help you with anything you request. They made a reservation at a restaurant for me before I arrived and even made not of my room requests, such as a late check out.

The spa is lovely and clean and a great place to refresh after a days walking around Barcelona. Located 15 minutes from the beach, and 5 minutes form a metro station and tram links. 

We had a room on the 28th Floor and could see all the way across the Barcelona Sky line, just Fantastic!",5,2015,10,26
28,Brilliant hotel ! Beautiful City,"We stayed on tThe Level part of the hotel that offers complimentary tapas ,wine and soft drinks throughout the day and also free access to the spa is included. We ne'er used the spa but the level facilities are most welcome after a long day out and about enjoying the city . 

We were welcomed my Miguel at the level reception who gave us a warm welcome and explained sell we needed to know to enjoy the city to the full .
Every evening we were so lucky for the whole of our stay to be welcomed by Katalina who was always interested to find out about the adventures af the day and I have make a very special mention to Sacha our waitress who was absolutely fabulous nothing to much trouble and very very friendly and always interested on how you were enjoying your holiday . I was there with my sister for her birthday and Sacha made our stay .
On check in Miguel noticed from my sisters passport is was here birthday the next day and when we returned on the evening a birthday cake had been delivered to our room which was very thoughtful and a nice touch.

The hotel itself is lovely but in need of a little attention it looks a little tired in places we had a sea view that was fabulous . Lots of people watching from the floor to ceiling window. The hotel is not in the heart of the tourist area approx €10 taxi to la ramblas but also it is 10 min walk to the beach from the hotel and you can them walk all the way to the heart of the hustle and bustle well worth it with plenty of beach bars to have a drink in on the way!!

I would recommend the hop on hop off  tour bus it's shows you the whole of the city and very informative.. We preferred  the plaza Catalonia for shopping . 
The food was lovely in all of the places we ate Tapas galore . 

All in all the whole holiday was fantastic and didn't want to leave . Barcelona has everything for a very very special holiday .

Once again thank you Katalina and Sacha from Hotel Barcelona Sky for making our holiday and stay at the hotel very special xxxx
",5,2015,10,25
28,Wonderful service and location!,"My daughter and I just returned from a 3 night stay at The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky. We were checked in by Yosel who was very helpful in telling us how to get around the city and offered to help us book any tours we may be interested in taking. We arrived early and were able to leave our bags while we explored the city. The other lounge attendants were all very helpful throughout our stay.

     Our sea view room was larger than most European hotels, with a very modern style. The room was very clean and comfortable. We had a Nespresso machine on the desk which we enjoyed, nice bath amenities and an in room safe. The Level Lounge was nicely stocked and we enjoyed stopping in at different times for breakfast, snacks and beverages. 
     There were a few areas we felt could be improved. We had difficulty using the light system and curtains in our room and we felt that more instruction could have been provided. Even with all the lights on, the room was very dark in some areas and I had to use my iPhone flashlight to see well enough to get items out of my bag in the evening. In addition, the reading lamp on my side was dangling from the wires on the wall and could not be used correctly. The bathroom was in need of new grout work and possibly a new shower base. There were beverages in the mini fridge and snacks in the room that were very expensive. Since some of the same items were free in the lounge, it seemed strange that we would have to pay such a premium for them in the room. We also wish that bottled water was provided, either in the room or in individual bottles in the lounge that we could take to our room. 
    These were all minor issues and we would not hesitate to stay here again on a return to Barcelona!",4,2015,10,22
28,Wow!,"Myself and daughter visited to celebrate our birthdays this year (50&16) we were not disappointed 
The Level lounge was fantastic, admittedly posh and quiet at some points, but the help yourself Cava, wine and soft drinks helped! Great city views, good snacks, helpful staff. Our Bedroom was great, sea view which could be revealed with the electric curtains... From the bed...very impressive, lovely toiletries, wi fi, lovely pool with Sunbeds and Cabanas..the downstairs breakfast had a good choice, we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2015,10,15
28,"Gorgeous hotel with wonderful, attentive staff.","The Level at Melia is a wonderful hotel. It is very central, easy to find and a wonderful base from which to explore Barcelona. The beach (though not sure it's a bustling part of it) is a 10/15 minute walk away as is a stop where you can pick up the city touring bus. The bus is great value for money and reliable - highly recommended. 
The rooms in the hotel are lovely, spacious, clean and many have lovely views. The staff are incredibly helpful. The lounge part of the hotel is lush, always stocked with drinks and nibbles and has lovely views of the city.
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,10,13
28,Good service,"We had a great service from Level reception especially Miguel very kind and helpful
and willing to satisfy guests.
The Level lounge is comfortable with plenty of drinks & food all the time.
Our room was not huge but spacious enough for two with great view with lovely Loewe amenity and very calm.
Spa area was pretty small but very relaxing after walking around Barcelona all day long and bakck to hotel tired.
We had a buffet breakfast on ground floor restaurant instead of level continental breakfast.
There are plenty of choice of food. I loved especially donut and cheescake!!
( one of my best breakfast ever )
Hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Poblenou metro station.
We enjoyed the situation short ride by metro to touristic area.
We also enjoyed the beach 15 minutes walk from hotel due to great sunny weather in October 30 degrees.

We will come back to  this hotel again for sure for our next trip to Barcelona.",4,2015,10,07
28,A curate's egg - good in parts,"We opted for The Levels instead of the Melia Sky as the extras looked worth the extra cost, and they were - especially if you book ahead and get a good price.  The room was well appointed with a fantastic view, as you might expect on the 21st floor.  The breakfast was good with lots of quality buffet choices.  Being able to sit on the 25th floor and relax was pleasant, as was sunbathing on the 5th floor by the pool.  The only negative points were:  it was difficult to use the 20 euro booking allowance for the mini bar as staff needed to be reminded to top it up; the electrics in the room were a bit temperamental (flickering lights on the wardrobe rail for example); questionable piped music by the pool. I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to be in the Poblenou area, or even looking for a reasonably priced option away form the centre (but handy for the centre) and for the beach.   We found travel easy into the centre via the metro/tram/buses. Someone arriving had their bags stolen whilst they paid the taxi driver - so vigilance is required as ever with Barcelona. We will return.",4,2015,10,05
28,Great hotel and wonderful staff!,"Great hotel!The staff is very friendly and helpful.I highly recommend this place.The rooms are big and the hotel is situated in a nice,quiet and safe area and it is very close to taxi,metro and city tour bus station.The breakfast was good.The lounge is also very nice.",5,2015,10,03
28,Wonderful break in Barcelona,"My friend and I had a lovely stay at this hotel, although a very large hotel it had a very nice and intimate feel to it.

The staff were super friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The young lady at the concierge desk was fabulous, very helpful as where her colleagues.

Level 25.... what can I say, the icing on the cake

The Pool and surrounding area is very small, very relaxing and comfortable at the same time.

Personally I wouldn't take children to this hotel... business/couples/friend definitely the place to stay.

The only bad comments I have is our room over looked a building site and the corridors/lift smelt of damp?

The location is great, just out of town but very close to the Metro and Taxi rank outside.",4,2015,09,30
28,"Great stay, love the Levels lounge experience - very attentive staff  5* service","Stayed 3 nights, impressive  modern hotel, closet metro and access to all major sites.
Had some technical issues with room lighting, housekeeping and TV. However, once the problems were identified, Pau provided exemplary service.  The staff could not do enough for us and it made our weekend away special. 
We would have no hesitation in returning to the hotel - The Levels rooms  are well appointed, very modern, and comfortable.  
Also, a big thank you to Caterina in the Levels lounge, and indeed all the staff, for not only being very attentive, but providing real hospitality, always with a smile and always giving a warm, well meant welcome and genuine interest in the guests to ensure they got the most from the hotel and their stay.

 Our thanks again to all the Melia Levels and Sky staff for making Barcelona a 'special memorable weekend'.
Graham Bright (room 2110)",5,2015,09,29
28,Loved this hotel,Had the Level experience which includes a lounge with complimentary nibbles and drinks all day. Comfy seats and sofas too. We had lunch there a few times. Little sandwiches and cakes etc. great coffee and unlimited wine and some spirits too. A great idea. Hotel also has lovely pool area with lots of loungers. Great bonus in a city. It's a little out of the town but the Metro is close by. Staff couldn't have been nicer. Good breakfast too with small area to eat outside. Rooms spacious with floor to ceiling windows and great views. Bed was amazing. Huge and so comfy. There is a pillow menu also. Has a Michelin star in the hotel but it was fully booked when we arrived so make sure you book in advance. Would def recommend this place esp if you want to catch some sun.,5,2015,09,26
28,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed here for a family birthday for a nice weekend for 6 of us. Yusel form The Level sent us an email in advance welcoming us and to request advance details to save time at check in ( which we al know can be time consuming when you just want to get to your room ). He also offered to help with restaurants, excursions, transfers etc. in advance which is a nice touch. The Level has it's own separate check in on the 25th floor and when we got there check in was the quickest we've ever had, thanks to the advance email. Staff throughout are very friendly and helpful in every area. The Level lounge is great. Wide variety of drinks and lovely fresh bite size food and sweets that are constantly refreshed. It's a great place to go before you head out for the evenng with great views of Barcelona. The Level staff arranged taxis on both nights for us which they let you know at the lounge when they arrive so no waiting around downstairs. Rooms are modern, spacious and clean. They could do with a refresh of paint etc. but this didn't spoil our stay. The pool area is very nice, comfortable and relaxed. Food and drinks served at the bar are very good and service again is excellent. Overall would recommend the Level to anyone for a great weekend.",5,2015,09,26
28,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel, perfect location. 
The level lounge was great, drinks and snacks available for the majority of the day, staff were very knowledgable about the area and extremely helpful, in particular a lovely lady called Catalina, nothing was too much trouble.
Breakfast in the Place was lovely, very fresh and huge amount of choice.
Rooms are modern and views are phenomenal, beds are very comfortable. Yes, they are a little worn in places but I wouldn't have mentioned it if others hadn't because they are immaculately clean and have a contemporary feel.
Drinks in the bar are quite expensive but we didn't buy many because we used the lounge.
Will definitely be back next year, loved it. ",5,2015,09,22
28,Great views but not really 5 star,"Having stayed at a variety of 5star hotels over the years , the Level whist great in several aspects is lacking in others. The lounge is fantastic, the food and drinks are replenished and changed frequently and it was great to come in and have a drink whilst planning what to do next, food was beautifully presented. 
Breakfast was plentiful if you ate downstairs but would not recommend eating outside. 
The room had a sea view - as its in the distance I probably won't bother for the extra money however I would go high. Beds were comfortable and the room clean, however we had to ask for the coffee machine, they didn't replenish the capsules and there were no robes or slippers. 
Shower was tiny and shampoos etc not replaced after first day. 
Staff were very friendly however I would not rate this as a 5star hotel. ",3,2015,09,11
28,Good but not 5 star,"On arrival room wasnt ready which was fine as we were earlier than  the 3pm  book in so made use of the level buffet and drinks which are included during the day which is included in the room rate at the level, it is good and frequently replenished.
We didn't get a coffee machine or robes or pillow choice which is meant to be part of the 5 star service.  Not a big thing but if they say they provide it then they should.  
We eventually hot the coffee machine and robes however we got 2 capsules of coffee over the 7 days we were there. We didn't ask for more as we were testing whether they would provide more and they didn't,  we shouldn't have had to ask. Parts of the room were dirty or grubby, again not what you would expect.
The staff are helpful but not 5 star. We asked for hotel to arrange tickets for familiar segrada not realising until trying to get in there that they booked them for the wrong day. We asked for recommendation for bike hire but they couldn't help there either.  We eventually found green bike hire on carrier ample which was good value and a good way to get around, 10€ for a day, 45€ the week. Metro also good value 10€ for 10 trips, so you can make transfers across lines at no additional cost if you don't go out of the metro. 
The breakfast service downstairs outside especially was pretty poor, most days we struggled to get a cup of coffee.
Drinks at the pool bar were very expensive, bar area Is ok large bean bags are pretty comfy. I will be getting some of these when I get home.
Location is ok cos metro is close and there are some good restaurants  and bars on the less touristy ramblas area.
Beach not far but beds and umbrella hire is expensive at 8€ per bed or umbrella. Overall good but wouldn't go back. ",4,2015,09,07
28,Fantastic hotel,A great hotel with excellent service. We enjoyed the food which was available in the Level. We found we could come back during the heat of the day and grab a light lunch and something cool to drink. We had a city view which we thought was lovely. It is ashore Metro ride into the city's only a ten minute walk to the beach. Pool area is nice with a small refreshing pool ,5,2015,09,07
28,Service & luxury,"From our previous arrival email requesting our pillow preference,  to a simple welcome smile from every member of staff , our experience at 'the level ' was superb. We arrived early @ 10am and received a warm welcome , the lovely staff sat us down with refreshments  (Cava /wine / beer or any soft drinks) and ran us through the hotel ,and facilities also tips on barcelona and a helpful map. We had requested a high level room and we we in the sky on the 27th floor!!! Amazing views . The room has a New York feel and the bed was so comfy ! Breakfast was lovely in the place & we were so well looked after at the level lounge the staff are constantly buzzing around topping up drinks supply & bringing out food selections. 
The location for us was lovely 10 minutes stroll to the beach that I think is the nicest part of barcelona beach with a cool beach bar. The metro around the corner lands you bang in the center even tho we walked into town and tan along the beach to the W and back that was lovely. I 100% recommended you visit the food market on the Ramblas  such a cool experience. 
The hotel delivered a beautiful gift of a bottle of Cava & chocolate  strawberries to our room so special!! ",5,2015,09,05
28,Brilliant - Wouldn't stay anywhere else!,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a few days! We paid for the level and the service was amazing. We were really looked after and you get free drinks and snacks all day on the level reception floor. Room was lovely with great views. The staff recommended some things to do and nice restaurants to go to which was very useful. The breakfast was also good with a great range of food to choose from. Facilities were great including a pool and spa as well as the location which was near Barcelona tour bus stop, a few minutes walk from the hotel. Also close to the beach which made it easy for nice long walks. We are already looking to come back next year! Very pleased with the hotel.",5,2015,08,24
28,Very enjoyable stay,"Hotel is in the Poblenou district, 5 mins from the metro, 3 mins from a local pedestrianised ramblas with lots of food options, close to a mini market if you need supplies and just over 10 minutes stroll to Bogatell beach, which I considered to be the nicest of the Barca beaches. 

We found the staff on level 25 to be exceptionally personable, helpful and efficient, the pool area was a massive plus with a nice bar, the room more than comfortable with great views and fabulous black out blinds, the ability to pop up to level 25 for refreshments was great and the buffet breakfast downstairs in the morning was excellent with Ana always exceptionally cheerful in many languages. 

",5,2015,08,14
28,Fantastic hotel,"We went to Barcelona for 5 nights to celebrate a 40th birthday with another couple. The Level is a boutique hotel within the Melia Sky hotel & reception is on level 25 with amazing views of Barcelona. Reception offers nibbles & drinks all day - yes free Cava on tap- from 7am until 11pm each day. A nice little extra to the holiday! We had room 2702, this had great views. Our friends were in room 1713 - they were on the other side of the hotel so had amazing views of the beach. Both rooms were very similar in decor & size, they had a window in the bathroom/bedroom so you could see right through which I liked.   The bed was very comfortable & the black out blinds meant we had a good night's sleep too. Breakfast is a buffet but with a really good selection & you could order anything cooked if you wanted. We ate in the The Place, the hotel's restaurant. We had tapas for starters which was lovely & fish & lamb for mains which were small but delicious. Cocktails are really good & reasonably priced. Le Pool was perfect for chilling out - cool music, refreshing cocktails, nice food & comfortable loungers & cabanas (95 euros with a bottle of Moet or 75 euros with cava) 
Would stay again!",5,2015,08,10
28,Great Hotel,"We stayed with friends for 5 days and had a great time. 
Check in was on level 25, and was a good experience as we were served a glass of Cava while relaxing on sofas while the paperwork was taken care off. We were later told that this lounge area was open 7am-11pm and you can relax here and help yourself to Cava, soft drinks, wine, coffee and snacks free of charge!!
The rooms were lovely with excellent views of Barcelona. One slight negative was our room was beginning to look a little tired around edges and could do with a refresh. 
The hotel bar and restaurant was good but expect to pay hotel prices. 
The pool was small but great atmosphere, and you can have lunch and drinks served to you most of the day. 
The hotel is a little far to walk to the main areas of Barcelona. However the metro is only 5 mins walk, or a taxi to town or port was around 10 euros. 
Special mention to Patrick at pool. Very efficient and great customer service, an asset to your hotel. ",5,2015,08,10
28,Greatly Disappointed ,"Was very excited to visit this hotel with the Trip Advisors recommendations and Amex as well. Though we were told The Level was a 5 star experience, and that is not the case. Upon arrival we felt very special and taken care of. Though after check-in things changed drastically. 

I gave one star just for two reasons, and that is being generous : 1. The view from the top floors is phenomenal  2. The housekeeping is very attentive and respectful of your things. 

Here are the reasons why they didn't earn the other 4 stars:

We tried to book a car with the ""exclusive concierge"" The Level was supposed to provide 3 separate times and they all failed and never followed up until we did ourselves. The service was very unprofessional. Also we had booked a massage which wasn't terrible, the masseuse was pretty good though we had to wait approximately 20 min for the actual service to start, delaying our lunch plans. 

Also do not plan on eating at their Michelin star restaurant because its only open Tuesday-Saturdays. 

Overall, the staff are not well trained, the service was not on par with other properties with similar amenities and the concierge service was unprofessional and completely ineffective. I could say more, but I'll stop here.

So If you are looking for to relax and not be frustrated by disappointments, don not stay here.",1,2015,08,05
28,Another level!,"We have never stayed in a 5 star hotel before, usually holidaying on a tight budget and staying in hostels. Maybe this made us biased and a little easily pleased as there are mixed reviews below, but we really had a lovely stay for my birthday. Check in was a little long as there are lots of trainee staff but they are friendly and do their best to help. The pool is small with a lovely atmosphere. Similarly our room was small (standard double, city view) but very nice - even a view of sagrada familiar from the floor to ceiling window! The nicest touch was the lounge, reserved for The Level customers on the 25th floor where we could unwind and rest our feet with a glass of cava and snacks (self serve) over a game of chess. A wonderful trip! Just make sure you get the metro into town instead of walking if you want to avoid blisters!!!",5,2015,08,02
28,Great stay would def recommend,"Very good stay- people moaning below are just being dramatic. Such a nice hotel. Yes there were scratches in the sink but how is that going to change the holiday?! Also yes there was so privacy in the 'getting read section' of the bathroom but there was a door for the bathroom and shower. What are you planning to do in the mirror? :-). Overall very good stay- pool was nice, lovely atmosphere. The only thing i would say is we waited a very long time for our sangria drinks whoch we complained about. But in the grand scheme of things it didnt really matter. Rooms were amazing. Spectacular views. Service good. So clean. And also the chicken stir fry from the hotel restaurant was absolutely beautiful. The hotel is near a tube but it is quite out of the city. It is worth travelling for though. They did ask for the deposit 50 euro a night but it gets refunded. If you stay in the top part of hotel which we did u get the complimentry food and drink whic was a nice suprise for us and a very relaxing time for us.",5,2015,08,02
28,Not a bad hotel but I've seen much better,"It's a nice looking hotel, and you feel special on arrival being summoned to the exclusive 25th floor. The room was really spacious and clean, though the upkeep is not perfect. The staff and service is hit and miss, some really friendly others not so much. Don't believe the late checkout hype. Food is just ok, though I would have liked to try the Michelin restaurant, it was fully booked. Spa was amazing though, so all in all a mixed bag...might try to find another hotel next time",3,2015,08,02
28,Not worthy of 5 stars,"Stayed here for a week with my girlfriend. The service and staff were great. However, at check-in be prepared to lay down another 50 euro PER NIGHT as a ""deposit"" (money will be returned) when you check out, but this will take several days. I was never told of this beforehand, so that's something to be prepared for if your bank account is on a budget. 

The city view from our room was great. The view from bathroom to ""bedroom"" was not. There's a glass wall between bathroom and bed, so no privacy here. Bathroom was very worn, with marks/scratches everywhere. Grime, mold and brown spots in the shower and corners of floor, and other places. In general the whole room seemed tired. Furniture was very cheap. TV was a small 32"" with only three-four English-language channels, none of those movie channels. It was National Geographic and Discovery Max, and something called FOX, which showed just the subtitles half of the time.

The bed was too hard, and not really comfortable. We both have back pains now.

The room was not properly soundproofed, we could hear everything going on in the hallway, and next-door room.

Fire alarm went off one time. I'm always concerned with safety - staying anywhere - so I checked the stairs, which, good thing, there are two of, one in each end (of hallway), but on several of the floors the doors were propped open, and some were blocked with trash bags...

The Level Lounge... Good thing, it was open from 7 to 23, free drinks and snacks all the time. But all the soda was warm. Only thing cold was beer and white wine. Nice view from here as well, but we didn't spend too much time here as we preferred the atmosphere in the hotel lobby bar. But where are all the people? It was very dead most of the time, even when there was a DJ playing.

What I have to commend is the staff/service, as that was as expected, and we felt well-treated. They were helpful in every way we needed service, and pleasant to talk to.

The gym was very small, not properly equipped for real strength training/bodybuilding.

The spa was again, very small, and just a big letdown.

There's a pool area, but yet again, this is also very small.

The restaurant, ""The Place"", at ground floor, did only have OK food, and a bit too expensive for what you got, it did also not have proper main courses, in my opinion. If you ordered a steak you got a steak, but that was also just about it. Where's the vegetables? Fries? Potatoes? For main courses, the meals were... minimalistic. As a consequence we did most of our eating elsewhere.

At the end of the day, I wouldn't stay here again, as I expect more from a 5-star hotel, the room would have to be in better shape, not worned down, not grimy/moldy bathroom and shower floor with brown spots, I was actually disgusted taking a shower. The shower did not have proper pressure, more of a trickle, and the water that did come out of the shower, did not want to go down the drain, it was so slow that the water would run over and onto the bathroom floor. Apparently housekeeping was aware of this as they always put a folded towel on the shower floor...",3,2015,08,01
28,"Excellent Service, good concept, tired in places","Stayed in the Level at the Melia Sky in a Junior Suite which are city facing, the sea view on the other side of the building is distant (about 800m), and I suspect in high summer (ok we were there in July but had 3 days of cloud :-( ), the air con will cope better not being in full sun all day.

Staff in the Level Lounge are very attentive and helpful and a credit to the hotel. You are given a lot of information about Barcelona by the reception staff, honestly too much to digest on checking in. And this is not about selling, there were a number of helpful tips about getting around cheaply (metro and tram service is very good if not always signposted), warning about tourist trap restaurants, etc. The staff are happy to book you tickets to the local attractions, we did not but we are not sightseers, however we did pass some of the attractions and can attest to the queues or even sold out days. Advise to have a pen and paper at the ready to note down recommendations (especially restaurants) as staff will vary and they give their own views.

The room was very spacious, noting the glass wall into the bathroom (WC in full view ;-) ). The lighting system takes some getting used too, each pad on the wall seems to operate a different set of lights. Usual facilities, everything you would expect in the hotel of this standard. Minor gripe, preventing 5 stars is that some of the decor was a bit tired, especially the enormous double sink area, cracked and split and disappointingly there was some noise from the floor above especially when their shower ran, it drained over your head when in bed (not literally!!). The service lift outside the door was noisy and could be heard even when the inner door (yes the room had its own ""lobby""). Both of these are minor except if they wake you up.

The Level Lounge has an included self service bar, small but adequate selection of drinks with spirits from 7pm, additionally there is a constantly changing nibbles selection appropriate to the time of day. Think small tapas style treats, on a couple of days when we had eaten a substantial lunch, it was sufficient for our relatively small appetites. Food was all of good quality but it is limited it's not supposed to replace a meal.

Breakfast is one for personal choice, you can take this either in the Level Lounge or in the main restaurant. We did 2 days of each and our personal preference was in fact the Level Lounge, there is a LOT less choice and NO hot food, but there was adequate cereal, fruit, juice, cold cuts, cheese and bread for our appetite. And more importantly tea pots which made all the difference to the morning brew. In the main restaurant there is more choice and a hot buffet, not an ""English Breakfast"", but more choice of everything, so it really is down to personal preference to which you prefer. 

The 2 nights we ate out, we do so locally and there are a number of restaurants in the local area, we choose 2 by no particular method in Rambla Poblenou and were happy both times. It's a short journey into Barcellonetta to the city centre if you want something more lively.

Getting to the hotel, we chose public transport,cheaper than a cab but took us 2 hours by the time we transferred from T1 to T2, waited for a train, caught 2 Metros and a Tram, about €6 each. O the return we took a taxi from outside the hotel 25 minutes if that and €36 later take your pick. If you are  going to do the public transport route, suggest a train to Passeig De Graig and then a Metro to Poblenou and then about a 400m walk - would be quicker.

One last point, you will get a welcome email asking about your preferences and stay e.g. pillows (asked for 5 got 5 !!). I also idly mentioned that we were coming to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we received compliments of the hotel an iced bottle of Cava in our room with chocolate coated strawberries on our first day. A very nice touch.

Summary:
The Level is an excellent concept that we enjoyed 
The staff in the Level were very attentive and a credit to the hotel (any minor issue was immediately sorted out) - noting the main hotel reception staff were no less helpful on the odd occasion we stopped there.
The most disappointing thing about our trip was the weather only one day of sun in late July !!! 

Would we stay again - yes I think we would.",4,2015,07,28
28,Few days in Barcelona,Spent few days in Barcelona. Changed hotel to try something outside of the city centre. Nice hotel located two blocks from the metro and just walking distance from the tram; very convenient. Room was nice with great view (23rd floor); an effort could be done on the smell like perfume/ambient candles or else. The Level lounge very well managed. Breakfast really good. Swimming pool terrace and sauna was very enjoyable. Fitness: the machines could do with some maintenance.,4,2015,07,26
28,Excellent service quality.,"I travel to Barcelona everyweek and I usually stay at The Level at Melia, main reason being service quality of the team.
Rooms need a refurbishent (which I think is planned), but service compensates this temporal situation.",5,2015,07,17
28,Not 5 Stars at all!,"This new giant building should be a 4 and 5 stars hotel, but there are many detail let away and nobody care about them. Experience at The Level is not worthy, being served for trainee people let alone during a whole shift is not my vision of  5 stars service. They are trainee!!! Rooms are quite nice, small, minimal decorated but not enough clean, check above the doors, behind the bed, etc etc. the worst is the unprofessionally GM, because we ask to talk with him but he was always in a meeting, supposedly. A thanks to all the staff to be friendly and professional, who tried to do his best in a difficult working environment.",1,2015,07,15
28,Long Live the Level,"Just returned from a 3day trip with friends and we are all missing the Level! 
Totally impressed with every element of our stay,  from the swift check in,  early access to the room,  the amenities  our room,  staff.. Everything! 
We booked a junior suite which was just divine with breathtaking city views from the 27th floor. 
The Level lounge made our stay.. The array of aperitifs and drinks available at all hours of day and night was a fabulous added touch.  We loved nipping in for a quick snack and chilled drink.  The staff in the Melia and The Level just couldn't do enough and we're so welcoming,  friendly and daily recommended places to go and eat. 
The pool area was lovely and had a short visit to the spa which although very small had the most amazing and hit steam room and comfiest beds to lay on. 
I cannot fault our stay or the hotel in any way. 
We didn't eat breakfast in the Level as we'd heard the choice was greater on ground floor restaurant. 
Loved it and already looking to have an annual girly trip starting with two of our 40th's next year! ",5,2015,07,14
28,Another lovely stay,"Have stayed a few times at this hotel now... Always stay in the Level... Well worth it.... Love the fact it has a rooftop pool to chill & relax in.
Staff in the level lounge always very polite and helpful, gave us good recommendations for local restaurants. Prefer to have breakfast downstairs at The Place. But all day snacks,nibbles wine, beer soft drinks available in the lounge with spirits being served from 7.30pm to help yourself from. It is away from the centre but can always jump in a cab.",5,2015,07,12
28,Fantastic Hotel and Great Service,"I visited the hotel for a romantic weekend to celebrate my 5th wedding anniversary. I was not disappointed and my wife felt that I had made an excellent choice. She said that she felt very special and a large part of that is the detail and the service offered to guests at the Level at Melia Sky. We stayed in a Junior suite on the 26th floor.
Shuttle bus from airport is 5.50 Euros each and then the hotel is a 15 Euro taxi ride from Plaza Catelonia. To get back to the city centre from the hotel you are a few metro stations and one line changeover away from Las Ramblas (15 mins max). We never waited more than 3 minutes for a metro train.
On arrival the hotel we presented ourselves to the reception at the ground floor. We were quickly whisked up to the Level Reception which is within the Level executive lounge. We were sat in front of two very polite reception staff and offered a drink. I chose beer and my wife a glass of cava. The staff spent 10 mins checking our details and giving us local information and maps. We were given the feeling of a very good quality hotel. The grin on my wives face said it all.
The level lounge is open from 7am to 11pm and offers snacks and drinks. You can also eat your breakfast in there but it admittedly has a little less of a selection that the main restaurant, the place, on the ground floor. The lounge consists of several very comfortable seating areas with sofas and chairs and a TV with BBC news on subtitles. Self service access to a nice ice bucket containing Heineken, Amstel and alcohol free beer, cava, wine etc. Food wise, lots on offer which looks to be prepared in the restaurant. Cakes, cookies, muffins, tapas, all that sort of thing. I liked the fact that they had the wee glass bottles of coke/coke zero/coke light/Schweppes lemon or orange with a bucket of ice and lots of nice glasses. These soft drinks alone are priced around 4 euros in the main bar and between these and the beer alone I definitely got my money’s worth. 
I loved the roof top pool (lots of beds/cushions available early July).
The room was brilliant. Yes, some of the furniture (the TV stand and sink in particular) have seen better days. The mini bar required certain technique to open as it was missing a handle. None of this really affected the feel of the room, it was otherwise extremely luxurious. My wife was very impressed. We spend 10 mins just taking photos of the room before settling. The junior suite was extremely spacious. Coffee machine, button pad with lighting options, electric curtains, two large flat screen TVs. Very nice. We also had a fantastic view of Barcelona with the famous Segrada Familia in clear view from our window.
Breakfast was eaten both days in the Place restaurant. Usual stuff, great quality ad excellent selection on both mornings with slight variation (sausages on Sat morning and bacon on Sunday). I had emailed the hotel ahead to advise that it was our anniversary. The hotel emailed back to let me know that guest relations would take care of that. On our return from sightseeing on Saturday we were welcomed in our room by a bottle of Cava in an ice bucket with a slate plate of dipped strawberries in chocolate with white chocolate buttons. Well done Melia Barcelona Sky, brownie points earned for me, very nice touch indeed. I didn’t think you were going to do anything but you chose to have this ready for our return on the actual day of our anniversary after a long day of sightseeing. 
On the final day we approached checkout at 11.30am to request late checkout. This was granted for free until 2pm (10 Euros per hour thereafter) but then we were told the best bit. We were free to use the facilities including the pool and spa (with shower and changing rooms) and the level lounge until we left for our flight. Our flight was at 9.45 PM so this was a massive plus. So many times we have checked out of hotels and felt like we were no longer guests. We were welcome to eat and drink for free until we were ready to leave. We went out for a late lunch after checking out at 2pm and the were able to sit in the lovely relaxing lounge until 7pm helping ourselves tio free food and drink as we pleased.
Overall this was an excellent experience and we were made to feel very special. Never before in a hotel have we experienced such excellent customer service. If we ever return to Barcelona we will return to this hotel.
“you did good” the wife said. Job Done ",5,2015,07,11
28,Excellent hotel,We have just returned from here after staying for three nights from 4/7/15 to 7/7/15.  We had an amazing time.  The hotel was great.  The private lounge/bar was brilliant.the service from the staff too was amazing.  We had our own reception desk and the staff there were so helpful.  We will definitely be back,5,2015,07,11
28,Fantastic service and facilities,"Chose The Level over the standard Melia for access to the lounge and added facilities.

Within the lounge drinks and nibbles are served as well as a daily continental breakfast.  There is always soft drinks, wine and a bottle of fizz on the go and in the evenings spirits are provided for you to make your own drinks.

The service is impeccable.  Without fail tables are cleared the staff all greet you and there is not a hair out of place.  The type of service you'd find in a much more expensive hotel!

We took advantage of the late checkout (extended at no cost to 2pm if availability) 

Only down side, if I'm being picky,  is location for the city centre.  The tube is close by but it never cost us more than 10 euros in a cab to town.

Highly recommended!!!!!",5,2015,07,08
28,Better than W by far,"Sitting here in the lounge ready to leave having a lovely snack and wine
Perfect position for metro to see everywhere
Best staff u will meet
The area has some fab restaurants and tapas bars
Lovely to have a cava in the lounge befor an evening out
Will be back soon",5,2015,07,07
28,Excellent hotel - well worth every penny,"Stayed here for two nights in June. Firstly, other reviews have suggested it is a long way from the main City Centre - it isn't that far. There is a metro station about 2 mins walk away, and it takes about 5-10 mins on the metro to get to the main centre. We also walked from the hotel to the Sagrada Familia in about 30 mins.
As for the hotel - couldn't fault it. The service was excellent, the room was very modern, the bed was so comfortable and the view was amazing. We paid a bit extra when we booked to stay at The Level and so glad we did - we got private check in at The Level Lounge, with Cava and snacks on arrival. The Lounge was constantly re-stocked with cold drinks, beers, wine, juice, fresh fruit as well as chicken wraps, salmon sandwiches, nuts and crisps, and so much more - and all of this is included in the price, no extra costs, to enjoy all day every day.
The hotel is also a 15 min walk from a beautiful beach, a lot more quiet than the main tourist part which is a bit further up, which made it so much easier to relax. 
We were given late check out at 1400 which was appreciated as we had a late flight home, but even after being out all day the hotel let us use the shower facilities at the Spa and still allowed us access to the lounge and its food and drink, even though we had checked out. 
Would definitely stay again, cannot fault it at all.",5,2015,06,28
28,weekend Away,"This hotel is on elf the best I have ever stayed in- Im not easily impressed 

Excellant service throughout our stay- friendly, professional staff .

if location is your priority - then perhaps this is not the best choice  - but for us the compromise was well worth  it...Takes about 10 mins to walk to beach from hotel     -   taxi ride to  marina and   centre - we did walk it   but  with a few  refreshment breaks along the route!

The Level lounge is a welcome relief after a tough day sightseeing 

Highly recommend",5,2015,06,23
28,WOW!!,This is the 2nd visit to this hotel and we cannot praise it enough. The difference from our last visit (September 2014) was noticeable although some of the same staff are still there. The Level is fabulous - and the Level Lounge an added bonus. Our room on 23rd floor was beautiful with views to the ocean (last time we had city views which are equally as good). The cleanliness and general order of the rooms is amazing - not sure how they keep up this standard. Many thanks to Yolanda for arranging our stay - her input was exceptional - and to all the staff at the Level lounge who were always pleasant and  ready to offer advise or to just have a quick chat. The young man in the lounge (not sure of his name) on work experience from Madeira was very nice and a true asset to this hotel - although all employees are polite and 'nice'!  The location is just right in Barcelona - 5 minutes walk to Poblenou underground station - tram stop outside hotel to go to the Olympic Village - 10 minutes walk to the beach. We walked to Barceloneta one day and it was an easy and enjoyable walk - with a few refreshment stops on the way! A big thank you to all at the Melia - and especially Yolanda - see you again soon!,5,2015,06,19
28,A fantastic hotel very friendly staff - Loved it!,"Just returned from a weekend break with 3 girlfriends which was booked through Expedia. 
We could not of gone to a better hotel... Unknowingly we had booked the upgrade to The Level (25th floor) which was the icing on the cake with drinks and snacks served from 10 am to 11pm included in the package. All the staff on the level and the Pool bar we execrably helpful in every way and nothing was too much trouble. The pool area was perfect for chilling and getting some rays with a inviting pool and bar serving food and drinks until 6pm. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be returning with my husband.",5,2015,06,15
28,"Nice stay, nice hotel, quiet place in Barcelona","If you want to avoid the too crowded by tourists in Barcelona, you can try this hotel located in the north and close to vivid and simpatico barrio del poble on where you can find nice and delicious restaurants.

The hotel is modern style, the rooms are spacious but could take advantage of refreshment. The pool is nice. If you're willing to speak native spanish with the crew, yo might be disapointed, the crew is international but their spanish in close to perfect.

Breakfast is ok but without any outsantding feature.",4,2015,06,07
28,A wonderful experience,"Would normally book an apartment in Barca but chose this hotel from a deal on last minute.com and it was an excellent decision. What a great hotel! Looks beautiful, most comfortable bed I've ever slept in and the service in The Level was exceptional. I will book again!!",5,2015,06,01
28,cincuenta cumpleanos,"midweek 2 night break to celebrate my 5oth... picked the hotel at random, and was not disappointed, a very chic hotel with great facilities and service.  worth staying at 'the level' , as you get access to the 'level lounge',  stunning views, and a nice supply of  drinks, and snacks...soft drinks, coffee, beer and wines, and after 9pm, spirits ...all complimentary. very nice staff, very helpful, and  all seem to genuinely want you to have a great time. I think the vibe of the hotel is more suited to adults, and it's a shame the pool area is not adults only, as it's a really cool chill out area, small splash pool, bar, bean bags to lie on or sunbeds, we enjoyed an hour of peace before some obnoxious kids arrived, screaming and splashing and  generally being a pain. rooms are nice, clean and  modern, techies will enjoy the remote control lighting and curtain opening , from a touch pad...there is also an ipod dock... good toiletries, including razor, toothpaste..toothbrush... if you like your room cool,  remember to leave a card in the electric slot, otherwise the AC doesn't work, and you will come back to a sauna. you cannot open the windows, so bear this in mind. ... the hotel is not central, but it is near the poblenou metro station.... you jump on the yellow l L4 line, and it is just 6 stops to Urquinona station, which is near the top of the ramblas... another good tip is to buy  a T-D10..ticket just 9.95 euro for 10  separate journeys, and it can be used by more than one person at a time.  self service machines are located in the metro entrance. definitely would recommend this hotel, it is very nice... good buffet breakfast as well, with plenty of choice, and more great staff",5,2015,05,29
28,never ending buffet/honeymoon,"we arrived in barcelona and forgot to see all the wonderful sights it has to offer as we were busy munching on the never ending buffet.
first off breakfast of ham, cheese and spritzers followed by nuts crisps and spritzers.lunch of crustless sarnies and spritzers was followed by top shelf spirits and spritzers.
the suite was exceptional especially having a bubble bath whilst looking down on barcelonian builders.
the staff were fannytastic especially a young ronaldo lookalikey and the lift was so quick your breakfast was left in the level lounge whilst you were already in the lobby.
the omelettes for room service were amazing and only five euros, our only regret was that we did not sample the twenty eight bux toastie.and also that we saw none of the city :)
we were gifted a bottle of bubbly on check in and this ensured our co operation in not stealing the robes(also we only had carry on luggage and couldn't spare the weight)
would definitely come back for another honeymoon, although not together",5,2015,05,29
28,Wonderful Experience at The Level!,"For most of our trip to Barcelona we stayed in hostels but on our last night decided to treat ourselves and stay in a hotel. We were blown away by the service and comfort of The Level at Melia. We felt very spoiled by the dedicated check-in desk and lounge offering free snacks and alcohol. If we didn't want to finish up exploring Barcelona our last night we would have never left the lounge! Our room was very nice as well, very spacious and with a great view. We also loved the pool and wish we could have spent more time there. Overall the price we paid would have gotten us a basic room in any other upscale hotel but at Melia it afforded us the absolute best and we felt spoiled. We will definitely return and hopefully for more than one night!",4,2015,05,29
28,We will come again,"The rooms were fantastic and the level lounge vas fine and very usefull during the day and before dining in the evning. We were 3 couples together.
It was fine that we could check inn before we arrived where a helpfull person give us all information off the level og the hotel and others questions.
      ",5,2015,05,28
28,Weekend in Barcelona,"We stayed 4 nights and in that time ample evidence to judge this hotel.The Level service is very good and the staff very obliging. The choice and range of food in The Place restaurant is limited foeven for a 4 night stay. The breakfast buffet choice after one night ""excluded"" bacon and mushrooms"" if required one could request them. Not good for an International hotel.Room cleanliness standard was not up to Melia standards,( we are gold card members)I found a peanut under the bed and cushions on the sttee were not ""fluffed up"" on all 3 occasions.Hotel situated in quiet area of Barcelona very accessible to city centre.",4,2015,05,27
28,"Amazing service, great hotel. The Level was extra special","Stayed at this beautiful hotel, the service and everything included at The Level is just amazing. Great views, nice spa. The perfect place to spend the weekend. Perhaps not the most convenient if you want to be right in the centre of Barcelona. but its really not far at all. Would absolutely stay here again, gorgeous room. Oh and the breakfast was incredible, so much choice and all delicious.",4,2015,05,26
28,"5* City hotel, Highly recommend!","From the moment I made my reservation at the Level at Melia Sky the hotels fantastic customer service became apparent and they couldn't have done more for us prior to our visit.  Before arriving we even received an email with a pillow menu and asking a few questions which would help make our stay more comfortable.

On arrival we were directed to the 25th floor where we were welcomed for check in and offered a drink.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful offering maps as well as help arranging any reservations and offering recommendations.

Our room on the 23rd floor was just fantastic, we actually couldn't fault a thing.  I had advised the hotel at time of booking that our stay was to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday and we were delighted to see they had prepared a bottle of iced bubbly, chocolate covered strawberries and a nice birthday message for him.  Such a lovely touch!

We used the pool area on a couple of the mornings during our stay and although there was ongoing maintenance it did not spoil it at all.  We appreciate that to keep the hotel at such a high standard there has to be work from time to time.  More of a small plunge pool really but a nice area to catch some sun and have a dip to cool down.

The use of the Level Lounge on the 25th floor was superb.  With complimentary drinks and snacks served all day until 10.30pm it was a nice place to go and relax with a drink.  Even upon check out (which was extended to 2pm) we were allowed to use the facilities and the lounge until it was time for us to leave for our flight at 7pm.  Even though we were too busy exploring the city it was nice to be offered as many hotels would not do this.

Location wise it was perfect.  With a metro stop just 5 minutes walk from the hotel we could get around the city very easily and very cheaply.  There is also a fantastic street with restaurants and bars just 10 minutes walk from the hotel for nights you don't want to venture too far.  Our taxi fare to/from the airport was $30 which we thought was reasonable.

I would like to thank all the staff at the Level who made our stay so memorable and we would definitely return on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,26
28,Nice Hotel,"Not in the city center but is a good location. The level Lounge (at 25 floor) is wonderful, all day long you will find there different amenities. The room is modern, in a different stile but need some maintenance. We had a 28th floor room city view. The white floor had scratches. Over all a nice hotel.",4,2015,05,25
28,First timer. Definitely coming back.,"Took my two daughters on a week-long trip this Easter hol. to Barcelona for the first time. The Level at Sky Melia was a very good base. It is away from the busy tourist track, but not too far to make it difficult to walk around. There is a tram line right in front of the hotel that takes you to metro stations, as well as a stop for the double decker tourist bus. Cocktail finger food is provided at noon, afternoon and early evening, with anon stop flow of Cava. Room wise, comfortable yet a lot of redundant space (such as a private lobby the same size as the bathroom, why?) and there were parts that needed to be spruced up. Bottom line is, when the hotel was built, materials used (especially the fixers) were not the best quality hence they could not stand the test of time. Didn't have much trouble with the automated curtain control as fortunately, I had my IT-savvy daughters sushi get it out. Didn't try out the pool, spa or the restaurant, so could not comment there. All things considered, I'd be happy to return when I bring the kids again.",4,2015,05,23
28,Another great stay at The Level,"Having stayed here 4 years ago for my wife's 40th we returned for our visit to Barcelona this year and were not disappointed. Excellent service, great rooms on ""The Level"" with the bonus of access to the Level lounge on the 26th floor with free drinks and snacks and amazing views across the city.
I highly recommend paying the minimal amount extra to stay on the Level as the money you save on drinks and food more than makes it worth it.",5,2015,05,21
28,"Est, est, est!!!","I would like to thank the  whole Melia Staff  for a unforgettable stay at this 5* hotel. The level rules! We just loved every minute of our stay. Nice rooms, comfortable beds, fantastic views over the city and really helpful staff. The location is great, just stroll down the Rambla de Poblenou to the beach. We will most deffenetly stay at this hotel again next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2015,05,19
28,two hotels in one,"Excellent hotel combining a 4 star and 5 star facility but unsure as to whether it works. book rooms at the level to receive 5 star treatment and superb views over the sea and or the city. food is only average unless you splash out for the restaurant dos cielos with its michelin star located on floor 24.
staff in the level are first class - nothing is too much trouble for them - enjoy the level lounge amenities and the personal attention to the guests travel and sightseeing adventures in barcelona.
hotel caters for business conferences and is located just outside the city centre but with easy access to the metro about 10 mins walk away.
melis sky is a modern hotel over 26 floors and as such the rooms do not have a balcony. a fault if you enjoy opening your bedroom patio to enjoy fresh air as oppose to being stuck permanently in an air conditioned environment.
hotel has a small pool area which i suspect would get fairly crowded in season as it is for all the hotel guests. not much in the way of outside space. there is a small outside terrace to enjoy drinks but again would be fairly crowded in season.

all in all a very good city centre hotel but needs some improvement which i understand is being looked at.

there are several good restaurants all within a 15 minute walk away.",4,2015,05,18
28,Best Hotel experience in Barcelona!,"The melia Sky is a beautiful hotel, the staff cannot do enough for you to make sure you're experience is top quality. We visited for the Grand Prix weekend and couldn't have enjoyed our stay anymore than we did. The rooms, food, cocktails and spa treatments we're some of our highlights. Will definitely be back!",5,2015,05,12
28,Great Experience,"We stayed at the Level for 4 nights recently and enjoyed our time here very much. I thought that the room was a little small, considering they are trying to sell and upgraded experience but the views out across Barcelona were wonderful.
It was my birthday while we stayed here and the hotel provided a bottle of cava and some fresh fruit to chocolate dip. Yum!
The Executive Lounge was very comfortable and a good selection of wine and food available through out the day. We did eat down the restaurant one night and I have to say that I found the selection of food, as well as what we ate very disappointing.",5,2015,05,10
28,Great hotel for a weekend break,"My sister and I booked he Melia Sky for a long weekend break away. We upgraded to The Level to take advantage of the better room, open bar, all day free snacks and upper lounge area. We had a warm welcome when we arrived, receiving a map and good directions and suggestions as to where to go in the city. 
We got up to the room which we were a little disappointed with. Although it had an amazing panoramic view of the city, it was a little smaller than we were expecting considering we upgraded. It was nice but didn't deserve the 5 star rating, it felt a little unfinished and lacked a little of the luxury we expected. We had to request an extra robe even though we'd booked a double room, the telephone was broken and the iPod speakers didn't work. But it was good enough for the weekend.
The pool area was lovely, although not heated, it was so hot on that floor it was nice to get in. It's cleverly designed so the sun reflects off the hotel windows to make it extra warm! However, the pool bar wasn't open the whole time we were there which was annoying!
The food was great, breakfast had so much to offer. We ate twice in the main restaurant which had more selection and once in the upper lounge which was a bit more exclusive. 
The location was good, we took taxis most places which always cost no more than 10 euro, but once we took a walk into town via the Sagrada Familia and it was lovely to see the culture.
We booked a massage each as well which was lovely and well worth the money. 
I signed up for Melia rewards which gave us some extra perks.
Overall a lovely stay, good value for money but has room for improvement.",4,2015,05,04
28,Fantastic Views,"From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and clearly very well trained. Our room was on the 23rd floor overlooking the city and had an incredible view of La Sagrada Familia. In the Level Lounge on the 25th floor you can enjoy tapas, snacks and an open bar all day. On the day of my wife's 50th birthday Miguel, the manager sent a bottle of Cava to our room, which was a very nice touch. The hotel may be a little out of the city centre but is easily got to on the Metro. We used the Poblenou station which is very close to the hotel. There is also a tram stop close to the front of the hotel.
We were very impressed with this hotel and the lovely staff and will definitely stay in it again.",5,2015,05,04
28,Hotel with Stunning Views,The staff at The Level Lounge couldn't do enough for you.  Even a few days before the trip we received an email asking if we needed any assistance with travel to the hotel or trips booked and asking how many and what kind of pillows we wanted!  The room had an amazing sea view.  Breakfast in the main hotel was a bit chaotic on the first day so we chose to eat later the following day which was much easier. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of Barca but not far from the beach.  Bathroom could do with an upgrade but would definitely stay again.  Instructions for the Nespresso machine would have been good!,4,2015,04,29
28,An eventful trip,"We had a wonderful time here. It is exactly what you would expect from a chic City hotel. 

The room had a stunning view over the bay and was well equipped with all the gadgets you'd need. 

The Level was great and a welcome place to chill out at the end of the day. 

It's a little way out of the centre but was all the better for that. 

A good place to relax.",5,2015,04,17
28,"The good, the bad, and the mediocre","We stayed in a THE LEVEL GRAND PREMIUM CITY VIEW room:
+ views
+ pillows from pillow menu
+ housekeeping are doing a reasonably good job - considering the interior design, scratched surfaces etc.
- rather bad interior design and maintenance (built-in ""wardrobes"", sliding door to shower stall would hardly slide and obstructed access to wardrobe, cheap-looking furniture, slight general shabbiness, etc.)
- very small, given the category
- poorly lit bathroom area - despite window to sleeping area
- light switches hard to operate
- no toilet brush
- room door always a crack open, even when properly closed (almost all of them on our floor, as we could see from the hallway), all noise from hallway audible in room
- worn-out (previously) white lino floor with black streaks all over it
- etc. etc.
= a far cry from a room one would expect at a 5* hotel

Level lounge and service were what made our stay acceptable and enjoyable in the end:
+ waitresses there were - by far - the politest and hospitable members of staff in the entire hotel (apart from one receptionist trainee)
+ food and drinks of very good quality and fairly good selection
+ nice views
- stag parties welcome?",3,2015,04,14
28,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at the Level for 3 nights two weeks ago.  This place is the perfect stay if you want quiet, relaxing, and reasonable.  The view was spectacular! Either side of the hotel is fine.  As others have stated, the higher up the better.  We were on the 29th floor and we loved it.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only thing that I could say they need to improve is more mirrors & lighting in the bathroom. However, I made it work. It was a very delightful stay and would definitely return. Thank you Melia for making our stay wonderful.",5,2015,04,10
28,Amazing time at the Melia Barcelona Sky,"We just returned from an amazing time in Barcelona mainly due to our concierge, Ilyan. He helped us book tours, make dinner reservations and helped with directions. He helped us get where we needed to go. For a first time visit we were able to do so much and enjoy many  fantastic restaurants due to the recommendations of Ilyan.  I would recommend the Melia Barcelona Sky to anyone. The rooms were perfect.  Service amazing.  Food wonderful (we ate breakfast at The Place every morning).  The staff at The Place were so friendly.  I would especially like to thank the staff walking around refiling your coffee.  They helped me start the day.  I would stay here again.  Thanks to all.",5,2015,04,10
28,Time to relax,"Great hotel with very polite service and personal.
The staff were attentive but not importunate.
The lounge ""The Level"" provide a fantastic overview over Barcelona.
We stayed in a big Familyroom for 4 people.
The Kingsize bed and the couch were suitable.
My family an me enjoy and relax the 2 nights in the Melia Sky Hotel.",4,2015,04,08
28,A great place to stay,"We stayed at The Level for 5 nights and it was a truly relaxing experience.  The facilities, service, food, room, staff were excellent.  There was a huge variety of food for breakfast.  The Level was open all day where you could help yourselves to drinks and snacks all day.  The snacks were varied, ranging from savory food, snacks to chocolates.  There was both alcoholic and non-alcoholic refreshments also available.    The spa and gym were relaxing and quiet.  Overall a quiet, comfortable hotel with excellent service.",5,2015,04,05
28,Very good value for money,"We stayed at 'The Level' for a 4 night break.

The lounge was excellent value for money. Very polite, welcoming staff. We decided to have our breakfast in the lounge, as there tended to be a queue for the downstairs breakfast area and the offerings were pretty much the same.  Also meant we had Buck's Fizz with breakfast!

Food throughout the day is constantly replenished so always fresh. Wine, beer and cava available through the whole day, spirits in the evening.

Our room (2704) has a great view, but as other reviews have mentioned, is slightly scuffed in certain areas (think this is mainly due to the style of decor chosen).  Only problem with the room is that the water temperature is VERY variable. Shower tends to change from ice cold to very hot by itself.

Overall, cannot fault the lounge offerings and attentive staff. It is what makes the hotel.",4,2015,04,03
28,Great hotel with personal attention,"I stayed at  this hotel 3 times now.. 
I agree some of the rooms need some renovation..
But the staff.. the kitchen.. the lounge are superb.
Great service..very friendly.. location of the hotel is very good, not to far from the harbor, casino, shopping..",5,2015,04,02
28,Very good on the whole,"Our bathroom was slightly tired (room 2007) the bathroom basin and shower tray having some minor chips.
However the stay was excellent; including breakfast; real fresh orange juice and also the facilities at the lounge; staff very helpful with some excellent recommendation's for local restaurants
I very minor point; our daughter was staying on the 20th floor and had a turn down service each night which didn't happen on our floor, stayed for three nights would return again",4,2015,04,01
28,Excellent customer services - nothing is too much trouble,The rooms - very comfortable. The lounge on 25th floor was fantastic with drinks & snacks available all day & free of any additional charge!! The spa area also included was open all day & evening - great for soothing aching bones after walking around the city. The hotel is very accessible to the city & the beaches. On the Av Diagonal  which has all public transport available if you don't want to walk. A definite place for a return trip.,5,2015,03,31
28,Great stay all around,"Nice hotel located (almost) on Av. Diagonal - good location, not so far from the city centre. Decent lounge available at the Level floor where you can enjoy beverages and snacks throughout the day and some evening drinks and food at the end of the day, so it's definitely worth paying extra for the Level room.",5,2015,03,30
28,The joys of the 25th floor,"The rooms are not that impressive for a 5* hotel, however the 25th floor 5* lounge more than makes up for it. Free everything, great views and excellently attentive staff. Cannot be faulted. We also relaxed in the jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Short stroll to the beach.",4,2015,03,26
28,Excellent value and exceptional staff,"Don't be put off because this hotel is not the nearest to the top tourist spots.  You will find yourself only 10 minutes walk from the sea front where you get the holiday beach vibe and can enjoy the bars, restaurants and random entertainment.  Melia Sky is also only 10 minutes walk from the metro and 20 minutes from the cathedral.  However if your not up for walking taxis are reasonable 10 euros to Ramblers, Gothic quarter and main shopping area.  If you book The Level enjoy a relaxed separate check in and great Level service from all the staff.  Definitely would recommend breakfast here as opposed the main restaurant , it's continental but perfectly civilised with views over the city from 25th floor.  The level also offers a full drinks and snack service until 11pm, perfect for a pre dinner drink or three and a nightcap.  We had a executive junior suite with sea view, you wake up to beautiful sunrises, weather permitting.  These rooms are quite large with seating area bath tub and separate shower, very contemporary in style, fantastic room service especially on 14th February when we enjoyed some very special touches, thank you for the rose petals, cava, chocolates etc, very much appreciated.",4,2015,03,17
28,Excellent Service at The Level,My family and I were at The Level for 6 nights and enjoyed an exceedingly high level of service from Telmo and Hugo. Great guys who were knowledgeable on the places of interests and made very good recommendations for us. The food and drinks in The Level were very good throughout the day - it's always nice to be able to pop by for a ice cold beer at any time of the day. Love the breakfast at the restaurant too. Overall great experience and will certainly recommend it for families.,5,2015,03,17
28,Very good choice of hotel,"We arrived at the hotel and as we had booked  a Level room we were taken up to the 25th floor reception to book in. We were met by Ilyan who was most welcoming and offered us a drink. After check in he asked if we would like to pay to upgrade our room to a Junior Suite. Wow what fantastic views of the city.  The hotel is a bit of a walk from the tourist areas, but it was an easy walk to the beach, local bars and restaurants and the Metro. We preferred staying here to the bustle of the city centre. Everyone is polite and helpful. I did complain that the sink in the bathroom could be better cleaned and this was attended to immediately. We used the private lounge on a couple of occasions for a free drink, but ate our breakfast in the main restaurant where there is a good choice of food. On Sunday we enjoyed seeing the runners going by from the Barcelona Marathon. Would I return? Most definitely. Comfy beds too. A great break.  Also, if you can, book Dos Cielos, the Michelin Star restaurant to eat in. A lovely experience.",4,2015,03,17
28,Melia Level visit,"We booked this hotel for one night as we were travelling from Lanzarote via Barcelona. We stayed at the level as we were part of the Melia rewards scheme and  got a good price.
Superb place. The service was excellent and the views awesome.",5,2015,03,16
28,lovely hotel,"the staff at this hotel are exceptional , they are helpful and always cheery . the hotel is very clean , the only downside i found was that they didn't serve a full English breakfast , only fried eggs, scrambled eggs and bacon , i would have give it 5 stars if we had a choice of full English.",4,2015,03,14
28,Nothing special,"When it was new, it could be a great place, but now everything is worn, outdated... However the breakfast is very good and as the Level guest you have special lounge with free drinks and snacks. Far from the city center - It's better to use taxi, metro station is quite far away. I won't stay here again.",3,2015,03,03
28,"Stylish, but looking a little dated at the same time","This is a good hotel.  Location is far enough away from 'touristy' areas, but accessible enough if your into that sort of thing.

I used the Melia rewards app to check in, but was required to check in again on arrival.  As with other reviewers I was offered a drink whilst checking in, I declined as I had been 'on the road' for quite some time and simply wanted to check in.

The room was clean had some modern features, auto curtains, Nespresso, and the strangest lighting system i've ever come across in an hotel.

But the room looked a little tired.  The view though was excellent.

The lounge was excellent.

I would stay again, on put it on a par with the Eurostars Grand Marina, at the port.",4,2015,02,21
28,Excellence which exceeded our expectations!!,"This was a family holiday trip - we occupied the Level family room at 23rd floor.

I have stayed at numerous hotels around the world over the past years but Melia clearly hit my top 5 list what comes to total experience at the hotel.

Firstly, views from the room and Level lounge were just spectacular. Usually when you compare hotel management taken pictures with the reality you do face some level of disappointment. At Melia this was completely another way around - simply stunning views of city on one side and sea on the other side.

Secondly, hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. They took our kids with kind consideration.

Family room was spacious enough for four (sofa converted to second bed). It was kept tidy throughout our stay.

Level lounge is nice with small tapas and drinks available thoughout the day although I would suggest to have your breakfast at the main restaurant as it offers more variety.

Hotel location is convenient - walking distance to Diagonal Mar shopping center, metro station and the beach.

I would strongly suggest this hotel should you want to pamper your family while you stay in Barcelona. Well done Melia!",5,2015,02,21
28,AMAZİNG !!!,"this was my 3 time stay in this hotel. everything is amazing. food , staf . specially Level . Virginia, Soraya , Adham and Ilyan . thank you all !!! my family also was very happy all moments we spent at Level.",5,2015,02,13
28,What more could you want ?,"Went here for a short break, meeting my partner from the UK. Ignore the folks who say it's out of the way. €6 for the Aerobis to Placa de Catalunya, walk 5 mins to the Metro stop behind El Cortes Ingelas  then 5 stops on L1 (towards La Pau) then 5 minutes walk and you are there.  15 minute walk to the coast, great tapas bars, smashing views etc. 

So what about The Level? Great service. Had an email before I arrived, asking if I needed a car from the airport, how many pillows did I want and what type  was there any restaurants or museum bookings I wanted made in advance. 
As good a service when you arrive. Gem, is a star on Reception, check-in was smooth and room was made available early. Niggle. Room 301 is a disabled room, great that they have the facilities, but didn't need or request them and the bathroom was like you see in an NHS hospital in layout. Don't get me wrong very clean, well laid out, but cold and functional and no ""proper"" shower fitting. No good if your partner has got long hair ! Requested a swap, no similar room available, but an upgrade was. Can heartily recommend Room 306. Great facilities, smashing view.

Lounge area at The Level was excellent. stunning views, breakfast and then Tapas and Wine present from 1000 to 2300 was superb. Staff extremely friendly, knowledgable and nothing was too much trouble. Having a glass of white wine, whilst overlooking La Sagrada Famila is a memory that will stay in the mind for some time to come. 

Was our first trip to Barcelona and guess where we will be stopping again the next time we go? You got in one, The Level at Sky Barcelona.",5,2015,02,12
28,"Beautiful hotel, excellent staff!","My partner and I stayed here for two nights to celebrate our 10 year anniversary together. We wanted to stay somewhere special to mark the occasion and I must say this hotel met my expectations.  The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. I loved the lounge bar on the 25th floor as you could see the views of Barcelona and help your self to snacks and drinks which were delicious.  The only downside was the bedroom as it could do with little revamping. Overall, beautiful hotel and I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,02,09
28,Did not want to leave! :(,"We stayed here for 4 nights in room 2104 and WOW as soon as we turned up we was greeted with big smiles and hellos the level is a must u will not regret it we were sent up to our private lounge area and check in where we was greeted by friendly staff who told us to take a seat and help urself to drinks and snacks. I could not belive how much was  complimentry and all day till 11pm!!!!!!! Food/snacks white/red wine, cava soft drinks we really did feel like VIPs staying in the upper levels! Well was that nice we didn't even make it to our room..till late Was so relaxed in there perfect after flying to relax and have a drink. When we did make it to our room it was amazing!!!!! Big bright, clean breath taking views! Everything about our stay was perfect!!! The staff cannot do enough for you GREAT service with a smile :)) location is also good away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to public transport and taxis to attractions are resonable to some of them it's even walking distance of your in no rush. Really recommend you will not be dissapointed only when it's time to go home!!! Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2015,02,03
28,Excellent.,"Everything has been as expected from this type of Hotel. I'm Melia Rewards Platinum and The Level it has less options compared to others, but still good. We were upgraded to the 2801 room that is a suite in the almost latest floor of the building.",5,2015,02,03
28,Outstanding service with a smile!,"We stayed at the Level for a couple of nights with our two year old.  The service was outstanding - from the moment we were picked up at the airport by a hotel arranged limo.  The executive room was delightful and full of very nice touches - especially for our two year old who had his own little set of bath amenities and his bed made up with his favorite cuddly toy waiting for him every night.
The view from the Level lounge is amazing, but even more so is the genuine warmth with which the staff catered to our every whim. 
This was the perfect way for a relaxing in-transit stop for a couple of enjoyable days in Barcelona between a long trip from the US to Asia.
Looking forward to our next visit...",5,2015,02,02
28,City break,"wonderful hotel, wonderful staff, excellent food

The hotel is not a ten minute walk from rambles, there is also a lovely Italian on the corner of the street.

Staff are so helpful and the facilities were excellent",5,2015,01,30
28,Everything I had hoped for and more!,"I want to start off by saying that my stay at The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky was absolutely wonderful, even prior to our arrival.

My friend and I stayed at this hotel from the end of December through New Year's and it was our first time in Barcelona.  I did extensive research on hotels as I wanted a hotel that was stylish/classy, had a good gym facility with great hours, and impeccable service.  I was immediately sold by the ""look"" of the hotel based on the photos I saw along with reading a good mix of reviews.  I also liked that they provided complimentary buffet breakfast everyday as I like to start my day with a good meal.

Prior to our arrival, I had a few e-mail exchanges with the hotel directly explaining that it was our first time in Barcelona and that I was coming in celebration of my birthday along with New Year's.  I also put in a request to be placed on a higher level floor for a nice city view (as the reviews I read said the upper floors were best).  I always received a warm response that addressed all my needs in a timely manner.  This in itself left me a strong first impression and I knew I had made the right choice.

We were placed in a nice room (compact but just enough space) on the 28th floor which provided a beautiful city view.  We were advised like all guests to check out the 25th floor which is their Level Lounge.  We had arrived Monday morning, so the Level Lounge was a perfect place to get situated and enjoy snacks/tea while also getting information.  There's also a front desk there with hotel staff there pretty much at all times of the day which I found to be very beneficial.

My friend and I really enjoyed the lounge as they change up the snacks all day (lunch and dinner more tappa style selections) and from 7-10pm, they put out wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages everyday.  I had no idea prior to booking the hotel that they provided so much complimentary.  It was an added surprise to say the least.

On top of that, the first night we arrived, we got a knock on the door later that evening.  It turned out to be a delivery of champagne and petite desserts with a note acknowledging the celebration of my birthday.  Again, just another notable surprise that shows true hospitality and thoughtfulness towards their guests.

In terms of the buffet breakfast, it is served every morning from 7-11am on both the first floor and the level lounge on the 25th floor.  It was nice they provided two locations because if the main one was packed (on certain occasions during more primetime hours, there would sometimes be a wait for a table), you could go upstairs to grab a bite to eat.  The first floor had a more extensive selection than the lounge did but both locations really did satisfy my needs.  Anything you could want for breakfast, they provided from eggs to quiches to fresh fruit to desserts, they really cover it all!  

In terms of the location, it's about 10 minutes by cab to most of the attractions and although not in the middle of all the action (such as Las Ramblas or Exiample), I actually preferred it this way.  There is a subway within walking distance (about 5 minutes) but we ended up using a cab the entire trip for the local stuff because everything was so close by cab to begin with.  By foot, I actually ventured outside the hotel area by foot and I enjoyed experiencing Barcelona also from the perspective of a local instead of being surrounded by strictly tourists all the time.  

The only downside worth noting (although by no means a dealbreaker as the hotel had a solution) was that their gym and spa facility were being renovated during our stay.  I actually didn't realize this upon booking the hotel back in September (to be honest, if I had known, I might have booked a different Melia or maybe expanded my hotel research to other places as having a gym is a priority for me).  I had only discovered this on my own from reading a few reviews a just weeks before our departure noting the renovation which lead me to e-mail the hotel in advance if it was finished or not.  

They explained due to the renovation, they had a gym within walking distance with free admission along with a hotel recommendation close-by for spa services (the hotel will even compensate the travel for you if you ask the front desk if you do choose to go to the hotel spa they recommended).  The gym really was close thankfully, maybe 3-5 minute walk and it fulfilled all my fitness needs so I was happy the hotel had an alternative within walking distance.  We also did try out the spa they recommended for a facial which was a relaxing experience.

The hotel staff was very helpful in terms of recommendations and also taking the time to order tickets in advance for any attractions (highly recommended to save time from waiting in lines, especially for the Sagrada Familia, a must-see and yes, get your tickets in advance--I was advised this before my trip and I am glad I took their advice).  

I had a general idea of things I wanted to see during my stay in Barcelona but didn't take the time prior to coming to really map out a plan with all the logistics.  This turned out to work out well because the hotel answered all my questions and helped it all fall into place.  I felt the customer service truly was above-and-beyond in every way possible way and I couldn't be more thankful for all their help!  [Special shout-outs to:  Letizia, Cristina, Tony, along with anyone I didn't catch a name.  All of you really made our stay so welcoming!]

I loved The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky and would recommend this hotel to family, friends, and anyone taking the time to read my review! :)",5,2015,01,22
28,5*****,"We stayed at The Level for a few days. When we arrive they send us to the 25th floor without saying why,, so our first thought was negative. When the doors of the elevator opened, they were waiting for us :). The welcome was very warm.

The room condition was really bad.. we ask reception to help us and they send someone to fix our problems. But the room was still dirty and with lot of damage. In the afternoon while we were having a glass of wine with the stunning views to the city, the level manager came to us, Gema. She start talking with us and give us amazing recommendations!! She also booked everything for us and prepare a touristic plan for our stay.  Moreover, the places that she send us were amazing! We loved the details of this girl and their time that they were all day on top of us just to make sure we were more thank satisfy.

I will recommend The Level to every single guest. The price is really reasonable and the service is more than amazing. Thanks to all the Team!! We will come back very soon (although rooms are damage.)",5,2015,01,21
28,Fantastic Christmas,"We stayed at this hotel over Christmas and had a fabulous time. We had a few problems when we stayed in October which we were assured would be sorted by the time we went and as an apology we had an upgrade to a junior suite which was fantastic. The room had a wonderful view over the city and was very clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and attentive as usual especially Letizia in the Level lounge and Alex in the restaurant. The hotel was quiet and relaxing and we really enjoyed our stay, with the metro around the corner we were able to get out and about and we are already considering when to go again.",5,2015,01,13
28,Could easily be amazing,"If I had to rate this hotel based on the staff and hospitality, it would definitely be a 5 star rating. Special thanks to Letitia, Ilyas, Marco and Carlos, to name just a few of the lovely staff we encountered and who took the time out to talk to us daily and advise us on local attractions and other personal touches; you made our holiday.

The Level really does provide an amazing complimentary array of high end snacks ( tapas, fresh fruit, sandwiches, pastries, olives, crisps and nuts etc) and a wide variety of alcoholic/soft drinks from 11am - 11pm - earlier if you include the lovely breakfast buffet available each morning from 7 am , which always included among other luxuries, champagne and smoked salmon (much better than the hot buffet available in on the PB floor).  We were happy to unwind with a drink and/snack each day, whilst enjoying the amazing views across Barcelona, with tasteful music playing in the background. The lounge caters for families well, with a comfy chill out area and television as well as books, puzzles and games. The staff in this part of the hotel are constantly on the go, topping up refreshments whilst taking time out to talk to you.

So where you may ask, does the hotel fall short?  The rooms and standard services you would expect from a 4 star let alone 5 star hotel. The rooms were as stunning as they look on the website with modern effects and technical equipment such as iPod docks and electronic controls for curtains and the wide range of lighting options available in the room. After being initially wowed - we then began to notice imperfections such as: chipped paintwork in the bathroom, dirty mirrors ( the shower door is also the door for the wardrobe and this had visible finger marks on it as well as a film of dust) the outer window was filthy - and whilst I appreciate  that we were on the 17th floor of the hotel, the maintenance should have been considered along with the design, in my humble opinion.

The room remained dusty for a few days into our stay. We were convinced that the maid came in, changed the towels, made the bed and quickly placed two complimentary chocolates on the bed before moving onto the next room. Frankly, we would have preferred a clean, dust-free room to chocolate. We also mentioned to the lovely Level Lounge staff about the fact that we had no hand soap; our 'heated' towel rail was not infact heated at all and that the bathroom bin didn't work. Everything except the towel rail was rectified by the penultimate day. We were told by the reception staff that the heated towel rails in the entire hotel were 'not working', which we thought was wholly unacceptable during what the locals considered to be an unusually cold winter. This also meant that we encountered a chilly bathroom  and toilet after a shower and that towels remained damp the next day. On the last night we also noticed that the shower was leaking, which considering its position - right next to the wardrobe, was quite a big deal for us. Luckily, we were getting ready to pack as this was our last night.

During our stay, we spoke to a few couples who reported the same problems as us and also had no joy in getting them fixed on time.

This said, I can see that the staff work extremely hard to be hospitable and in my opinion could not work any harder. The fault lies in the poor design of the rooms and in the below average level of cleanliness and maintenance in the guestrooms - all public areas are well-maintained.  

It will be interesting to see what is in store for this hotel in terms of overall maintenance, as they are currently refurbishing what used to be the healthsuite -  recently fire damaged. 

Overall, an average hotel stay that could easily have been amazing.",3,2015,01,03
28,Superb hotel with great seaside views,"We stayed a night at the Level (top floor section) in a beautiful suite which was modern, nicely furnished and with stunning seaview and large floor-to-ceiling windows. Friendly and professional staff. Bubbles and canapes at check-in. Delicious breakfast. The hotel entrance is a bit odd as you cannot really stop your vehicle anywhere. They should consider to establish a short term parking bay. Otherwise absolute great value for money hotel. We will be back.",5,2015,01,02
28,A Stand Out Barcelona Hotel,"Just returned today from a 3 night stay at this very stylish hotel for New Years. The Level Lounge was a very welcoming check in, with glass of something cold offered before we has even checked in. Staff very good and welcoming, and fantastic views from the Level Lounge which is gratis all day to Level guests with a good range of drinks and snacks. We booked a Grand Premium Sea View, which was a little on the small side for two adults and a teenage daughter, but stylish, comfortable and with great sea views. Bed was exceptionally lovely, and very welcome after a Barcelona trek all day. Only a couple of small things that let our room down... the bath had no plug, which I find very hard to understand how this had been missed by housekeeping and room managers (I would expect a plug, and the the chance to sink into a hot bath in a 5 star hotel), (the plug appeared only after the 2nd time of telling the level staff)The shower had a mind of it's own and not very powerful on the hot setting. We ate breakfast down in the main restaurant, which was hot and plenty of choice. We also treated ourselves to the hotel's NYE celebration Dinner... which was FANTASTIC, from the cocktail reception with very lovely appetizers to the out of this world five course dinner with wine, drinks and the the all important 12 grapes at midnight... very, very well done and a beautiful evening. 
All in all a lovely hotel, great staff and although not in the centre if Barcelona with a good pair of sensible shoes everywhere is within an hours stroll (even if your teenager complains!)",5,2015,01,01
28,A perfect hotel in Barcelona,"The exclusive 25th floor as a reception and breakfast area for the Level is a great idea, very convenient, the staff was very helpful in planing and booking all our activities, the suit was very big and nice, the view to the sea and watching the sun rise every morning is unforgettable. ",5,2014,12,30
28,Wonderful Staff,"This is a cross between a boutique hotel and something else. The only problem being that I can't identify what the ""something else is"". Whoever designed the lighting certainly had a sense of humour. We were there for 5 nights and we still weren't sure which switch did what. However, the bed was extremely comfortable and the staff were charming and attentive. We would stay there again.",4,2014,12,19
28,Good In Parts,"We stayed at The Level for 5 nights and had booked a Premium City View room. On arrival at the hotel we were offered an upgrade to a Junior Suite and after seeing our allocated room which we thought rather small and cramped we decided to take the upgrade. The Junior Suite was a good size and was quite comfortable. However, when we moved into it it was not as clean as I would have wished - particularly the bathroom!! Room cleaning in general I thought was a bit of a let down. The hotel advertised that The Level rooms would be serviced twice a day - this certainly did not happen every day we were there. The Level Lounge was an excellent facility with snacks and drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) available from 7am until 11pm. The staff in the hotel were generally very good, although there did seem to be quite a few trainees who needed quite a bit more training. A couple of the staff in the Level Lounge we were very impressed with, one for his excellent restaurant suggestions and one for the assistance given to my wife after her purse was stolen in the city. Overall I got the feeling that the hotel was a little tired, and to my mind was certainly not 5*.",3,2014,12,17
28,"Excellent hotel,excellent staff and excellent service","Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip. The views from my room, 23rd floor, were stunning with a vista across the city and the best distance view I had of the Sagrada Famillia. The hospitality we received on the 25th floor lounge, was second to none and a great way to relax after a long day at work. Room was really comfortable, bed huge, shower great. Breakfast was available downstairs or in The 25th floor Level Lounge. I tried both and the food was of a very high standard and variety. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,23
28,Not 5*,"Although not the worst hotel, definately not 5*.  There was a lack of detail throughout; I asked for tea facilities to be put in the room but this was not actioned.  There was only 1 bathrobe and slipper despite 2 guests being present.  Minibar was stocked incorrectly which led to me being late charged, however upon informing them this was refunded.  The most annoying this was not being told in advance that the spa and gym were closed for refurbishment despite this being the reason I had booked the hotel.  Room in need of refurb, bathroom door would not close properly.  I had informed reception but nothing was done about it so we let it be.  On the plus side, breakfast was great, large selection and good quality.  The level lounge was also excellent and proved great value for money.",3,2014,11,20
28,Great conference stay ...,"... Even to extend for the weekend afterwards.
The rooms- especially those in the upper levels- are cosy and clean.
The breakfast Menu and bar/ snacks at the Levels bar are great, too.
Metro station ""poblenou"" is only a couple of minutes away. Unfortunately the gym wasn't ready build yet but we got guest passes for the public fitness center near by which was good as well.
",5,2014,11,17
28,Sassy W style in need of makeover ,"I traveled to Barcelona for a conference at the Forum and chose to stay a little farther away from the classic convention hotels. I had the junior suite which was lovely- as many travelers already noted, it needs some refreshment- but the views, the service and the comfort more than compensated. I would not choose if i were a first time visitor to the city, but if you are looking for quiet, value and excellent service close enough to business and all the main attractions- this is a great option. ",4,2014,11,12
28,Never a 5 star hotel,"I booked the level at Melia thinking it was true a 5 star hotel.  When we arrive the staff was very friendly.  Our room was not a 5 star room.  The floors were with lot of scratches, the electric curtains didn't work, the door of the bathroom was broken and they put a tape.  There was no complete mirror in the room.  Told the staff about the door and that there was mold in the shower they said they were going to fixed and when I came at night it was the same.  We order a burger and french fries to room service and they told us they didn't have more.  How can a 5 star hotel run to of potatoes and saying they had room service 24 hours.  I definitely would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for a 5 star service. For me it was like a 3.5",3,2014,11,09
28,Fantastic Hotel,"This is a hotel worth looking at! We were advised to check it out and although we booked a little late I have to say the quality of service, food and beverages were second to none. This is a hotel that prides itself on service, ensuring nothing is too much trouble for the staff who were brilliant. This hotel would have had a 5 star rating but for a couple of issues: The rooms although spec'd out well were just a touch tired, but certainly nothing to complain about. Loved the automatic button to open the curtain so that we could watch sunrise over the sea from bed on my birthday - wonderful! The second was that when we stayed the spa was out of action but we didn't have time so this was not a worry anyway. 
If you are looking for somewhere to stay you could not go wrong with this place, really was very good including the service on the 25th Floor. If you don't know what i mean then let this be a little pleasant surprise for you, i am sure you will like it!!",4,2014,11,06
28,Stay at the Level,"This hotel is very close to the Poblenou station.  This would be a good place to stay if you are already familiar with Barcelona or do not need/wish to stay immediately adjacent to the downtown tourist spots.  This was our 3rd trip to Barcelona but the first visit to this hotel.

We arrived mid-afternoon and went straight up to the level lounge to check in.  Xavier and Esmee greeted us and offered us cool drinks right away.

The room was clean and modern.  There was a little bit of wear-and-tear (some scuffs on the floor, etc) but overall no major complaints.  The room had large windows facing the ocean - a really breathtaking view.

The lounge has an open bar, snacks throughout the day.  There is an excellent view of the Torre Agbar and La Sagrada Familia from the lounge.

Breakfast was included.  We were advised to have breakfast on the first floor rather than the lounge, as the breakfast on the first floor was more expansive.  It was delicious.

Service was friendly and efficient.  I would definitely return.",5,2014,10,30
28,Great stay and great value!,"We stayed here for my husband's 50th..the staff were just lovely, special mention to Leticia and also Gema.  The hotel was very accommodating and even put a bottle of Cava and fruit into the room while we were out.  Yes the rooms are a little tired but for what we paid I don't think you can moan, other 5 star places would charge 2 or 3 times more.  The reception is a really cool space and we had some lovely cocktails there.  The Level lounge was a nice touch and a great place for a pre dinner drink. Re location yes it's a little way out but I have been a few times to Barcelona and didn't want the full on pace of the Ramblas, here I felt a lot safer and you are a 5 minute walk to The Ramblas of Poble Nou, much quieter with some lovely restaurants and then another 10 minute walk to the lovely beach. Would definitely recommend!!",5,2014,10,29
28,Excellent stay,"The melia Barcelona Sky is well  situated. Its walking distance from  2 shopping centre,  Glories and Diagonal Mar. The train station Poblenou is a 7-8 minute walk and there is a tram station a few minutes from the Hotel. 
If you choose this Hotel, choose to stay at the Level, the rooms were fairly spacious, you have access to the lounge, which has drinks and snacks 7am to 11pm. Though this is deemed as 5 star, you need to remember that this is 5 star Europe, which is never really 5 star as such. The rooms were good, but they could do with a little bit of TLC, ie removing nails from the floor, working doors, tidying up chipped bathrooms, but don't let these things put you off. 

The staff at the Hotel were fantastic, a special Thanks to Ainoha, who arranged for my husband and I to renew our wedding vows at the Hotel ( A surprise I didn't know about). Ainoha was simply amazing!. Si que si did the ceremony, so a special thanks to Gemma and Victor who again were amazing. 

The restaurants were good. The Michelin star restaurant was great, the food was never ending!. 

1 small complaint would be of the lounge. Though  there were snacks, we were a little taken aback that these were not covered. Its was hot and there were flies flying all over the cakes!. Someone does need to take note  of that. 

If you book the Hotel, book directly with melia,, as they do have offers and we had an offer  where they were giving u 20 euros a day to spend in the Hotel on drinks etc and you can also become a rewards member. 

Overall I really enjoyed the stay, and the staff were helpful. I would come back to the Hotel again. Yes there were some imperfections, but nothing that can't be fixed and most Hotels have small imperfections.",4,2014,10,28
28,Perfect Stay,"Just got home from a 3 night stay on the 23rd floor. Modern room, fantastic elevated view of the City and surrounding hills, massive shower area and nice collection of toiletries provided.
Best bit is on the 25th floor where a great range of complimentary drinks and food are provided pretty much all day long into the evening, it's actually hard to shift yourself when youre sat looking at the view with a cold beer, perfect after a long day in the City or just before going out for the evening.
Breakfast on the ground floor was great with everything you could want. Tube is a 5 minute walk away and reasonably priced taxis always sat just outside reception. Lovely stretch of Beach 15-20 minute walk away.  For the price I cannot imagine staying anywhere better, fantastic value. Will definitely stay here again when we next visit.",5,2014,10,27
28,fantastic stay!,"Stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. Stayed on the 28th floor. Great views of city, lovely room (yes there were some minor imperfections but didn't take away from the feel of the room). We had breakfast in the level lounge everyday, good choice and tasty. Snacks and drinks were great and very much appreciated on the hot days! Staff were very helpful (one girl was quite miserable on our first day but didn't see her again after that). Location was quite a way out but Poblenou tube was a 10 minute walk and glories was about 20 mins. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, definitely stay again. Shame the spa facility wasn't available to us as there was a fire a few weeks back which incidentally the hotel never told us about, lastminute.com did and the hotel never mentioned the fact we couldn't use the spa facilities the whole time we were there. ",5,2014,10,22
28,Lovely hotel!,Stayed at the hotel at the beginning of September and had a lovely stay! The rooftop pool is lovely. Unfortunately there was a disruptive guest by the pool but staff dealt with this extremely well without causing a scene. Our bathroom was quite small but not uncomfortable so and the hotel is only a short stroll away from the beach. Checking in did seem to take a while but caused no inconvenience. Would most definitely stay here again!,4,2014,10,20
28,Nice stay at The Melia,"We stayed at The Melia last weekend for my birthday. We had a nice room on 21st floor overlooking the sea. Lovely view although the sea was quite a distance. The room was very modern so would not be to everyone's taste. A large window separates the bedroom from the bathroom so you can see straight in. It does however have a blind that can be closed. The lights and blackout curtains are operated by buttons next to the bed and as other reviewers have said working the buttons can be a bit of a pain although there are instructions. The room had both a bath and a shower but I would not say it is 5 star as there were lots of stains on the sink and attention to detail was not 5 star. The room however was very clean and everything was in working order.The reception area and cocktail bar looks fab. We ate in Dos Cielos which was excellent, and the hotel restaurant The Place which was also good but we thought had a bit of a limited menu. Breakfast was good, plenty of choice. The hotel is about 7-10 minutes from the yellow line Poble Nou station. A little far out of town but busses stop close and there are also taxis immediately outside. The staff were all very polite and helpful. We stayed in The Level which we found to be excellent. Plenty of snacks throughout the day and wine, cava, spirits,beer or soft drinks, as much as you wanted until 11pm. The view from The Level lounge was amazing and the staff were all great.We would pay the extra and have The Level experience again. We had a lovely stay, with a bottle of Cava and chocolate strawberries left in our room for my birthday courtesy of the hotel.",4,2014,10,17
28,It os complicated to rank it...,"I've been to a several 5 stars hotels, so in my opinion the ranking of this hotel needs to be divided into 3 categories:
1. The staff - Is 5 stars. They are very nice and polite and very very kind.
2. The room - Is 4 stars, it is mice but it is not 5 stars. The TV is only in Spanish, so we couldn't really watch anything on it...
3. The food - Is 3 stars maybe. The breakfast is cold. Cold eggs and cold everything and it is not taste.

At the level they offer free snacks all day long from 07:00 till 23:00 and it is very nice and refreshing. ",4,2014,10,14
28,Excellent service and stay!,"We stayed here for 4 nights and had an amazing 5 star time. The staff were so polite and helpful and the level lounge and hotel were so chic and beautifully designed it was a pleasure to spend time there. They level lounge was worth the price with complimentary beers, sodas and kava and wine and delicious snacks throughout the day overlooking the whole city including the saggrada familia.  A few small notes that because the hotel is such a high tower there are no windows that open. And there was a strange signature smell to the hotel.  Other than that it was a fantastic stay!",5,2014,10,14
28,Not a 5 stars...,"Ok, the views are great. The pictures of the room you find on-line are an example of good marketing: they do not lie, but they exaggerate reality. After the first good impression, the lights in the room are more annoying than cool: very difficult to shave or put on make-up. Many accessories are worned out, and there is a general lack of attention to detail that does not make this a 5 star hotel. I would prefer a more central 4 stars for the same price next time. ",3,2014,10,09
28,Friendly staff,"Room wasn't ready at check in (but we were early) so sat and enjoyed the views (and free drinks & snacks) in the lounge until it was ready. stayed in a junior Suite.  Nice big room, but as others have said, in need of some TLC and updating.  Had breakfast in the lounge daily - nice (continental) choice.  Staff very friendly and helpful, I would echo others views that the tables could be cleared a lot quicker.   Towels by the pool.  Hotel is some distance from the main action of Barcelona - but it is walk-able. 10 mins to beachfront. Taxi's available from directly outside hotel.",4,2014,10,08
28,Unsafe,"This would have been a very different review if it hadn't been for a fire in the hotel.  We arrived to a warm greeting by the level staff, room as expected, clean with a great view over the city.  Hotel close to the beach and a jewel of a street filled with various eating places.  
It all went wrong when a fire started on the fifth floor.  We were only alerted that there was a fire by the smell of smoke in our room.  No fire alarm had gone off, corridor outside our room full of smoke.  On our way down the fire escape which was over twenty floors we found cleaning signs propping open fire doors, stacked chairs and cleaning equipment blocking the stairwell.   
After the fire the place seemed to be in chaos.  It was gone 02.30 before we were moved to a new hotel.  No plan in place in the morning with no information from the hotel despite repeatedly ringing.  Gone midday after seeing other guests returning to the hotel with there belongings we decided to go back and collect our things.  Reception staff unhelpful, stressed and borderline rude.
I would never return to this hotel, clearly guest safety is not there first priority.  I would have given this hotel a good review if it hadn't been for the fire.  I felt unsafe, at times that my life was in danger and that the hotel had failed dismally to handle a dangerous situation.",1,2014,10,05
28,Very pleasant  stay,"I stayed there with my whole family. The personell were very pleasant and wellcoming and we were treated very well, unfortunately there was a fire one evening when we were there but we were transferred to the Hilton hotel for one night and the next day we got to move back to our room. I warmly recommend this hotell.",5,2014,10,02
28,Very Diappointed,"Do not believe all the good reviews. Currently staying here and very disappointed. We booked The Level for our honeymoon. We arrived before check-i, however we were well greeted and found a room ready for us.  Unfortunately, we get to the room and find it a handicap room with no shower.  I went back to Reception and was told there were no other rooms ready.  I asked to upgrade and was told they had a suite available for an extra fee which I agreed to. Arrived in the new room to find it adequate, though in desperate need of a refresh. The bathroom countertops were chipped, the floors dirty and scuffed, etc.  2 days later, after a day of rain, our windows began to leak requiring them to move our room yet again!  Thus time the room was a bit better, but still needed to be renovated.  The last straw was when we had to wait at the reception desk last night for 15-20 minutes just to get change.  At one point I asked the Concierge, who was doing nothing he entire time, if he had change.  He replied he didn't and that we would have to wait for Reception. We finally were waited on and received our change.  When I asked for an umbrella, the Desk Clerk said he didn't have any even though I just saw the Concierge retrieve umbrellas for 2 different guests. I then went to the Concierge and asked for one and he brought one out.  One final note, his hotel is not very close to the center of town. Recommendation: Do your homework. There are plenty of better hotels closer to all the attractions""",2,2014,09,29
28,Comfortable,"Read some of the negative reviews prior to going and as per usual if your going to walk round a hotel with a magnifying glass you will find faults anywhere.  I really enjoyed staying here we went for my wife's birthday and found the room comfortable which had great views, the level lounge at the 25th floor was nice and also found the staff pleasant. 

The pool area is soo nice and relaxing in fact it stopped us visiting the places we wanted to !! I would definitely go back and though I am not a regular 5 star hotel booker I found the price reasonable and didn't feel out of place as I guess. You would in other 5 star places. 

Location is a bit out of barcelona but anything is reachable by the metro, there are some lovely restaurants near by and a short ish walk to the beach. All in all recommended !! ",5,2014,09,24
28,5 star - we don' think so !,"On the plus side :- great city views, modern lobby and nice cocktail bar, helpful reception staff.
On the minus side :- definitely in need of a facelift, room somewhat cramped and several areas needing addressing eg chipped table, duck (or is it duct?) tape on shower and toilet doors and non-functioning electric curtain, level lounge understaffed leading to uncleared tables and messy floor - nespresso machine nearly useless !
Disappointing on several levels !",3,2014,09,23
28,Very enjoyable stay,We stayed at the Level. The Room was very nice - Beautiful view over the city. Staff were very helpful. I would highly recommend. We were fortunate enough to have access to the Level lounge - Which provided us with some lovely snacks and a nice glass of champagne.,5,2014,09,10
28,Excellent stay at the Level,"We stayed for 4 nights celebrating our anniversary and we really had a good time. Rooms are nice, modern and staying at the Level gives you a fantastic view of the City / Sea. Beds are comfty and the ""pillow service"" is very nice.

We had 1 rainy day in Barcelona, which gave us a good opportunity to try the Spa section. Consisting of 2 showers (hot/cold), 2 saunas and a Jacuzzi there is not too much to choose from, and if there are more than 6 persons at the same time it feels very crowdy. We didn´t try any treatment though, nevertheless the overall environment gets you in a relaxing mode.

The Pool area is fantastic, very relaxing and comfortable. A perfect place in sunny days. There is live music, and a nice range of drinks & snacks at the bar. Service is 99% good, however one of the waitors was more eager to take selfies with the girls in the area than to serve, so he missed my order of 2 mojitos, which we never got. He didn´t speak spanish so maybe he misunderstood me (I ordered in spanish)...",4,2014,08,28
28,Great service and fabulous red level hospitality at the Level in Barcelona,"My husband and I had a fabulous time touring the city from this slightly out of the centre destination, however the metro is easy and great value. The hospitality in the hotel especially red level is amazing, great people , great food and lots of fabulous drinks and cava ! The pool bar is trendy and busy, the best part is the Dos Celios Michelin restaurant , worth every penny , culinary masterpieces ! ",4,2014,08,26
28,Very nice - not exceptional,"In the middle of a four night stay in a junior suite.  We have stayed in a variety of hotels from no to 5 star and this hotel is trying hard to be great but isn't quite.  The suite is nice but attention to detail is lacking.  Wonky doors, loose bathroom fittings, non-functional light controls, thin towels, etc.  However, the suite is okay albeit as others have said the room felt a bit tired even though the hotel only opened in 2008, signs of slightly shoddy workmanship on construction I think.  On the positive side, the pool deck is nice but crowded during the day, the breakfast buffet is very good and 'the Level' lounge on the 25th floor is great.  Lovely view and free beer, fizzy wine, soft drinks and snacks throughout the day combined with wifi meant that it was tempting to just sit and slob in the comfy chairs  ...",4,2014,08,25
28,Modern hotel in a fab city,"We booked a level room for 5 days in July. 
When we checked into our room we noticed that it wasn't a 'level room' (missing certain perks such as Nespresso machine and was on the 16th floor) when we raised this with reception we were immediately upgraded to the 26th floor. We felt slightly annoyed that the hotel tried to short change us. 
Despite this gripe, we enjoyed our stay and would return in the future.
I would recommend upgrading the the level, the lounge is opened from 7am to 11pm, has a well stocked bar and the food was lovely. Hotel is close to beach and short cab ride away from the centre. ",4,2014,08,24
28,close to beach and city centre,well appointed bedroom but stupid shower tap......the 'exec' lounge was excellent giving you reasonably good food plenty to drink and open till 11pm and inclusive with your room....although they ran out of marmalade and seemed it difficult to find a banana but worth a stay! nice area and only 20 minutes walk from the beach.,4,2014,08,22
28,Trendy chic for a few days,"Just got back fro a 4 day last minute break at this hotel for my girlfriends birthday.  The hotel has a cool modern vibe.  The rooms are nice and quite chic.  Our room was a little bit tired. Chips to the laminate sink, cracked glass door to the shower.  But all in all it was comfortable and modern.  The views were nice.  We found all the staff to be nice and helpful.  Breakfasts on the ground floor were nice and the cocktails and lunch bar were good. Food menu at the pool was a little limited. The Level lounge upstairs was nice as well for coffee and drinks, light snacks.  Great view from there. We didn't try the main dinner restaurant but it had a great bar. You can walk to the beach in 10 minutes but the relaxed bar area and cool bean bag sun beds by the pool were really comfortable.  There were a few kids which seemed strange as its not a hotel for kids. It should really be adults only like like fabulous Melia in Illetas, Mallorca. All in all great for a short stay.",4,2014,08,22
28,"Nice,  but mixed experience","I'm writing this review from my hotelroom as I'm staying the hotel at this moment. 

We booked 2 The Level ""Grand Premium"" rooms which supposed to be on "" the higher levels""  of the hotel,  offering the best views.  Also,  they supposed to have Nespresso, bathrobes and slippers,  nice toiletries,..  None of these things are actually present in our room on the 16th floor.  Also,  in a building consisting of 28 floors,  I do not consider 16 a higher floor.  Nor does our view of a construction represent the best view I think.  

When I asked the nice man at the Level Reception Desk if we maybe mistakenly been given a standard room he responded we got a Level room as booked. The fact that all the other guests on our floor just booked normal rooms begs to question this a bit..  Eventually he did get us a Nespresso,  which is nice,  but nothing of the other Level room extras.. 

So,  while the Level Lounge on the 25th is a nice touch,  don't expect to get a better room for your extra money. ",4,2014,08,20
28,Best 3 nights ever,"Booked on last minute.com....
Wasn't to sure what the hotel would be like, but no complaints.
Checking in time was a bit delayed but both my wife and I were made to feel so welcome and treated amazing, that we couldn't grumble.....
Staff were helpful especially a lovely woman named Esmee. This place is a great getaway from the norm and you will feel like royalty in the sky bar. 
Mr & Mrs Solanki.",5,2014,08,18
28,Fantastic view,"We are a family of 4 who had 3 days awailable in Barcelona prior to a Mediterranean cruise in July. We waited very long with this hotel booking, but just 3 days prior to arrival, we were lucky and managed to book 2 rooms at The Level Melia Sky. Arriving at the hotel we took the lift up to level 25 and waited a few minutes in the beautiful lounge, when the friendly staff checked us in to our rooms at level 23 and 26. You can see that the rooms have been used for a while, but we had absolutely nothing to complain about. The fantastic view from the rooms, the superb breakfast and the friendly staff made this stay memorable. Sitting in the lounge at level 26, enjoy complimentary drinks and some light food when you look at the stunning views of Barcelona was great. The only thing we found a bit strange about the hotel was that you had to pay EUR 75 in order to hire a special area close to the pool. We didn't find any good reason to do this, as you could use the pool anyway. The hotel is located in a very nice area and its just a 10 minutes walk to the beach. You reach the center of Barcelona easy by Metro or taxi. Overall we had a great experience at this hotel. I would also like to say a special thank you to Eric for exellent restaurant recommendations and to Marta for great service.",5,2014,08,04
28,Mixed experience definitely for couples than for mixed groups,"The Level at Melia was part of a last minute package booking for my 17 year old daughter and myself for 4 nights.  I requested a twin as opposed to double room as I was travelling with my daughter.  Knowing I had booked ""The Level"" as opposed to the main hotel with it's own separate entrance and apparently separate address, the very knowledgeable taxi driver was very confused where he was going.  Eventually we found the hotel simply by looking for the tower rather than by the address.  The separate entrance related to a separate reception, we were politely taken up to the correct floor by a member of staff and checked in.  We had arrived early and were offered courtesy - it was made VERY clear that check in was at 3pm and the room would not be available before then so we made plans for things to do for 2.5 hours.  The manager on the floor was then very put out when we made our way to leave as ""our room was nearly ready"".  I could see on his screen the request for a twin bedded room and asked whether this was what we would be getting.  No - the twin bedded room was not booked - we had a king size bed.  I asked whether it would be possible to change to a twin bedded room.  The answer was a very abrupt no.  OK - no big deal - I have shared a bed with my daughter before.  The room itself was small but quite nice - on 17th floor with a great city view.  No sign of the bathrobes which were supposed to be supplied or the Nespresso coffee machine.  Later it became clear that this had to be booked and paid for so not as advertised by the hotel.  It was clear over the next few hours lots of things didn't work - light on desk was not working - a good job I was here for leisure and not work.  Once again no big deal.  However, as stay progressed, more and more annoying things became apparent.  The lighting was terrible.  There is a light linked to the clothes rail in the closet which goes off after 30 seconds plunging you into darkness.  The bathroom lighting is inadequate for applying make up or shaving.  There is not enough lighting in the bedroom.   The rainfall shower, big enough for 4 people, was useless and generated a trickle of lukewarm water.  There was no bath.  The little shower that you're supposed to use to wash your bottom half didn't work at all.  However, the ultimate killer was that the wall between the bathroom and bedroom is entirely made of glass and you are fully exposed as you enter and exit the shower.  That's great if your on your own or on a romantic break and want to look out onto Barcelona while brushing your teeth, not so great if you want to conserve some modesty and not scare the living daylights out of your 17 year old daughter.  There is no dressing area if you exclude the toilet that is so narrow that your arms touch the walls on either side.  So we spent 4 days shouting ""going in"" and ""coming out"" to spare modesty.  We raised the issue of the shower after the first night thinking we had done something wrong to be told that ""there was no water because the pipes had burst"".  Once again lots of apologies for the burst pipes but in fact the problem with the shower  was maintained for the whole of our stay.  Breakfast on The Level was included - we were never told we could eat in the main restaurant.  This was OK - a bit of a frustrating experience as you serve yourself on a 5 inch cake plate.  The selection became a bit boring after 4 days.  If anything it was great for my diet.   The pool is tiny and people come in from outside to use it - there were screened off canopied benches (the ones you see in the hotel photos) which you had to pay €75 to use.  These were almost always empty even though the rest of the pool area was heaving.  The complimentary food and drinks on the Level were a nice touch - however there is insufficient seating and when it rained, people camped out on The Level so not a chance of getting a seat.  We were told off for trying to take a drink - water - to our room after someone assumed we had left and taken our seats and there was nowhere else to sit.  Probably the real downer was being eyed with suspicion when we asked to dine in the very empty restaurant and having somebody else's mini bar bill charged to our room.  This was resolved on checkout with apologies but once again no attempt was made to draw our attention to the mini bar charge - it was just assumed we would pay whatever the hotel charged us.  Aside of the missing and broken items, service was very  mixed.  The staff on reception were very helpful when asked questions.  However, the advertised turn down service was only done on 1 out of our 4 nights - perhaps coincidentally the night of the burst pipes with chocolates left on our pillows.  Likewise one morning we were hassled several times by chambermaids wanting to make up our room at 8.30 am and couldn't understand we were not ready to leave for the day yet.  On the plus side, stay was reasonably good value for the 4 nights we stayed.  While the hotel may be an architectural icon with some interesting features, it is not practical for a mother - daughter visit and service is far short of 5*",3,2014,08,04
28,Not like the other Melia hotels we know,"We arrived late at the hotel to find out that the rooms we booked were not available, they oversold the hotel, they said the room we had was the same as we had booked but on a lower floor, upon checking in we found our selves on a small room with no view, again we complained and the next day they moved us to the rooms we were supposed to get on the 26th floor, nice view of the city.

The restaurants are ok, the Cielo Restaurant is very small and requires reservation a couple of days prior to dinning.

The lounge was nice with some appetizers and drinks up to 11pm.

The pool was small but nice to hang out for a day, the pool water is freezing!!!!

As for service this hotel can be a hit or miss, we encounter many helpful people and not so helpful ones.

For our next stay at Barcelona we would not stay at this hotel.",3,2014,08,03
28,The Level is The Level,"My friend & I decided that a weekend trip was in need, especially as her birthday was coming up. So after browsing Lastminute, I found a great deal for The Level & booked it straight away, & that was the best choice I made!

After delays with our flight, we arrived at the hotel tired & just wanting to sleep. Check in was smooth & we had a nice surprise, with a free upgrade to a Jounior Suite which was great! Got to our room, which was on the 20th floor, people beware the lift doors are quite dangerous, as they close very quickly. We learnt that the hard way buy shutting the door, on other guests & each other! 

Our suite was amazing, with a small reception area as you walk in with a mirror. Small living area which included a sofa bed, desk area & iPod speaker. Through to the sleeping area which also came with a lounger. It's been a while since I have slept on a single bed, but I just say the beds are very comfortable. The bathroom was lovely, with a double sink, bath & shower which was accessible with blue back painted glass sliding door. My friend & I got a little shock, when we noticed you could see straight into the bedroom through the bathroom, but then realised that there was a blind we could use for privacy. With all of that the best part of the room, was the view it was amazing especially at night looking out at Barcelona & all it's lights was breathtaking. 

With booking The Level, we had access to the lounge were we had breakfast. Have to be honest nothing great, just basic continental. We also had breakfast in the main restaurant, which was a lot better. A huge selection of everything. Hot & cold foods, pastries & fruit. Other than breakfast we spent a bit of time in the lounge & why wouldn't you when it comes with a Open Bar, with a great selection of drinks! The drinks & food, are looked after by a lovely set of staff who are very friendly & helpful.

The pool area was also great. Atmosphere was fresh & friendly, staff on call to provide you with a cold cocktail as you lay in the sun tanning. The pool area was filled with a selection is seats, whether it's loungers by the pool or a seating area on the outside, there was always a spot to get your tan on. Area was well maintained, staff are very vigilant with cleaning up & making sure guests are not hogging the loungers by leaving their towels & going off. 

Unfortunately we didn't manage to try the restaurant, as we spent most out time at the pool side eating & drinking, or in The Level lounge eating or drinking, but next time we will! Yes there will be another trip to this hotel. With there amazingly friendly staff, from the lounge, pool, main restaurant & check in. To the clean & well maintained rooms & common areas why wouldn't we. It was just a shame we had to leave in the first place.",5,2014,08,03
28,Don't expect 5* you will be disappointed,"We arrived at the melia around 10.30 and checked in downstairs (were not told to go upstairs to the level and relax basically told to go and do our own thing but we went up anyway!) 
We had lovely relax in the lounge and told to help ourselves to food and drink (however this was not clearly complimentary to us the rest of the time - we just assumed as nobody told us) 

Rooms lovely amazing views on floor 28 but little things are a bit annoying, old sink which looks dirty but are just old, one dressing gown, shower shelf broken, phone didn't work all things we noticed throughout the stay (we were there to have a good time, not moan!) next day there was no water this was fixed by the evening and we were given complimentary bottles of water to apologise (ironic?!) this happened again a few days later. 

Breakfast was lovely on the ground floor (although level staff told us this always ran Til 11- it didn't- it was 10.30 mon-fri) lots of choice- you will have to queue a few minutes and watch some stressy managers directing the table staff who flutter around more when managers are there! 
Pool area is lovely and clean - staff attentive and friendly. Bit put out by having to pay €75 to hire some areas that sit free a lot of the time - just seems like this could be available to level hotel guests.  
Spa area - wouldn't bother it's nothing special - gym looked good enough modern equipment - we had a week off though and didn't use it. 
Location is good, metro is good and taxis always available. Overall this hotel is great but little things make it less than a 5* the only difference between melia and level is the lounge and the views you get and to be honest they don't monitor the guests who come and use it and pretty sure we had 'non-level' guests using these facilities as they came up from the lower floors!",4,2014,07,29
28,Amazing views! Good service!,"Amazing hotel with stunning views!

We arrived at Melia after reading the reviews and went straight up to the Level. We were greeted by two receptionists who offered us drinks and checked us in. We were very impressed by the drinks and nibbles available in the level lounge - a very nice touch and was nice to have a few drinks before going out for dinner in the evening. Would be nice if there was an outdoor terrace up there aswell so that we could enjoy the nice weather.

We went to the pool and spa once and we were not overly impressed - The pool was smaller than expected and cold.

The room was lovely - The view was perfect and the small touches such as the electric curtains always help. We ate breakfast in the main restaurant everyday, there was plenty of choice and staff were very friendly with good English. 

We were extremely impressed with the reception staff, it rained on out second day and when I asked where the nearest shop was to buy and Umbrella I was told that I could borrow one. I also asked where the nearest post box was and was told they would post it for me. 

Our only complaint would be the room service - as far as we were aware room service was in the morning. We came back from dinner one night and the room had been cleaned again during the evening. As we were not aware this was going to happen, we had left personal items on the side.

Overall - a lovely hotel with amazing views and great location for the beach and centre.",5,2014,07,28
28,"Was great 5 years ago, but lost some luxury now.","This was my families third visit in 5 years to this hotel. The hotel is fairly priced and we got a great executive suite on The Level.  To the hotel management I will recommend to improve the poolarea and the breakfast! And please do something about the menu by the pool. I bruke my tooth on the pizza, but I am thankfull that the management ordered a dentist and took the bill. The team was very service minded. 
Hotel is perfectly located with just 15 minutes walkover to the beach and 5 minutes by taxi to the gothic quarter and La Sagrada Familia. Also closely located to a shoppingmall just 5 minutes walkover away. You will have a good stay here!",4,2014,07,20
28,Great Melia hotel in Barcelona,"Staying at the level we were offered a sea view upon arrival and to help ourselves to drinks, etc while the room was being allocated. The fact that the lounge was open to us and all of the drinks and snacks were free was amazing, really make a huge difference to the stay, the rooms were beautiful and clean and had everything we needed. The bar staff were fun and friendly and cocktails we ordered were perfect! All staff were helpful and did anything to make our stay the best it possibly could be, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you very much melia sky we will be back.",5,2014,07,19
28,If you like to avoid the tourists this is the place,"After checking many hotels and had a few reservations in maybe better hotels in Barcelona, I finally choose The Levet at Melia Barcelona Sky. It is located in pobleneu, a charming neighborhood, 10 minutes walk from the beach. The building is amazing  and the views of Barcelona are outstanding. Choose a sea view, is priceless when you open an eye and push a button the curtains open and the Mediterranean Sea is the first thing you see from the bed. Room is cozy, a bit small but very comfortable. Very high tech and everything works properly. Bed is very comfortable and invites you to stay there after a long summer day walking in this amazing city. Bathroom was comfortable, with separate tub and shower on my room, 2012 but if you want soap bar you have to ask it constantly. My request of extra towels never was done and have to ask for them every day. The first four days the mad the turndown but the last three no. Minor issues that they have to work. Staff at the level is very friendly very nice people. The breakfast was continental, never had it there, I took it downstairs everyday and was great selection. Hours d'ouvre nothing spectacular, they have to improve them and the selection of spirits, cava and sodas was great. The level is open until 11:00 PM so you have a place to relax the whole day. I had dinner at the hotel three times downstairs and the food was awesome too. In spite of being a bit retired, the hotel is three blocks for pobleneu metro station and you will be in plaza Catalunya in 10 minutes. Great hotel, great location, not a 5 stars as they say but I will definitely will be back.",5,2014,07,16
28,A Good Stay in Barcelona,"Stayed at Level @ Melia Sky Barcelona for 4 nights recently. It is about a 30 minute dive by cab from the airport. Cab fare about 30 Euro. Location slightly away from city centre but have a taxi stand just outside the hotel which is very convenient. The metro station is just about three blocks away and it is about a less than 10 minute walk which easily takes you into the city centre.
The hotel itself is clean, neat, compact and modern. The rooms are small and quite well laid out. The breakfast is good. They have a dedicated Customer Experience staff who will look into your needs during the stay. The Level is a 25th floor executive service with food and drinks for customers staying at the Level, open till late. 
I have no complaints about my stay. I would have preferred a hotel nearer to the city centre where I would not need any transport into the city",4,2014,07,16
28,Good choice,"We had a comfortable and relaxing stay at the Melia sky - the level. The hotel is divided into different parts and the Level is the five star top part of the hotel. We enjoyed the free drinks with the cool cityview in the lounge and the charming neighbourhood offered a nice feel of mingeling with the locals in the evening. Short walk to the metro (opera). We did not use the poolarea alot, but it looked nice and the hotel is located a short walk from the beach (15 min). 

We noticed some guests complaining about minor stuff and sure there may be some shortage in some areas (like the room only had one bathrobe, the shower kept running after you turn it of, the floores and bathroom are a bit scratched up) but hey - if you are not too picky it will be fine.. Also the free drinks in the lounge help settle the mood. 

We stayed at floor 28 with cityview, I really recommend the cityview!! You can lay in bed and watch Sagrada familia - awesome! :)",4,2014,07,15
28,a stunning hotel,"I have spent my recent holiday in Barcelona in this hotel for 9 days and besides few things that I haven't liked about this hotel,I can honestly say this is the kind of hotel where you can relax and it is very worth for the money you pay.It is not located in the heart of Barcelona but the metro is few minutes away and in few stops you can reach the centre or the beaches.We chose the level because we have a silver memebership with melia hotels so the price was good and there were more benefits like the fact that you have a lounge area where you can drink and eat whatever you like and any time of the day and evening since it is open till 11 pm.I especially loved the fact that each day they had new things on the buffer, like salmon, cous cous, chips, peanuts, ham and cold meats, fresh bread and all different kinds of sweets, from pastries to cakes and muffins.All this food tasted delicious.The only negative thing I can say about this area is that it would have been much nicer if it had had an open space like a patio or balcony since we are in a place where the weather is so nice and warm.We asked if we could go to the terrace with the drinks, and it was told  us that we were not really allowed but they could do an exception.This to me is unfair because when I went to the pool I could only buy drinks from there, instead since I had to pay for this special The level treatment I wanted to enjoy the pool with the drinks from the lounge area and not have to pay because I wasn't allowed to bring these drinks out of that area.
The breakfast is really wonderful in this hotel they have so much choice of food and drinks , the only negative thing I noticed is that the staff didn't look as they were very professional or happy to do their job.In fact couple of times I experienced examples of very bad service:one time I had a glass of sparkling water almost full and despite I was still eating the waiter came and cleared the glass and he didn't even hear me when I tried to tell him I was going to drink that water.Also another waiter was carrying several dirty plates on his hands and to clear mine he put the dirty plates from another table on my table so he could stack on them my dirty plate.
We also had several drinks at the bar downstairs and we were very impressed with the bartender, I believe his name was jose and he was from south America, this guy made great drinks and was always smiling and professional with us and with other customer.
The last thing I would like to say about this hotel is that even though it was a great place to stay they should improve the way they welcome customers at The level reception.In fact on our arrival we were very tired and stressed because since there was a taxi driver strike we had to walk and use the metro with our suitcases.The guy at the reception asked straight away for a credit card and me and my partner we only carry debit cards so he told us that in that case we had to pay in advance for the whole price.And also they wanted to take a deposit of something like 250 euros which we preferred not to pay as we were going to pay cash for any purchase inside the hotel.Honestly this attitude like ""You just arrived, you have to pay now for everything"" ddnt make me feel like a valued customer or like a person that has a membership with this hotel",4,2014,07,13
28,Nice hotel but not up to 5* standards!,"I chose the level for my boyfriends 30th birthday as I wanted a 5* hotel with views of the sea. When we arrived the hotel was very modern and generally the interior was quiet dark but very nice. Our room was on the 23rd floor and we had fantastic sea views. After reading reviews on trip advisor we new to go up to the 25th floor to check in and the lounge here did not disappoint. From the lounge we had lovely views over the city and it was a nice quiet area we could relax in after a long day, there was always plenty of snacks and drinks which are all complimentary and the staff were very friendly. 
However by the end of the week we were very disappointed with our stay and do not feel it was up to a 5* standard. The room was nice but the small things let it down like the grouting in the bathroom was either mouldy or missing, the towel rail did not work, and the floor just looked dirty. The house keeping was our biggest issue during our stay, there were no robes or towels as advertised, the coffee was never replenished and the cups and glasses never washed. I would expect in any level of hotel never mind a 5* to be able to come back after a busy day sight seeing to be able to have a drink in a clean cup! Despite mentioning to staff every day the situation never improved. I shouldn't have to be constantly complaining whilst on holiday, I am wrong to expect the hotel to have mastered these basics! We left our room no later than 10 everyday and did not return until 10-11 at night so they had plenty of time to get it right!
We also found there was a lack of information about the hotels facility's and what there was was conflicting. One of the attractions of the hotel was its gym, we had planned to get up early have a work out then go sight seeing for the day, the first time we went to the gym was about 8am the air conditioning was not on and it was to hot, to top it off the water bottle was empty and was there were no staff on hand to get assistance. In the end we gave up and headed for the pool. When we got to the Poole everything was shut up and there were no towels out. We asked later where all the staff were and were told the facility's don't open until 10am this was a bit disappointing as we were hoping to make the most of our days. On our chill out day we went down to the spa at 10.00 only to be met by an aggressive cleaning lady screaming at us in Spanish that the spa did not open until 11! When we eventually did get in we wished we had not bothered, only the sauna and one shower was working and once again no water! When it came to check out we were charged for items in the mini bar we had not touched and oddly we were asked to leave feed back on the hotels website like the people checking out before us! 
We were disappointed but I will say that the staff in the level lounge were very friendly and helpful.",3,2014,07,10
28,"Dear God, give these people guidance!","With such an amazing location, located for the 27th floor I was ready for 3 days at 
The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky. 

Smiling while I enter the door, there is absolutley no line in check in! Perfect! 
Passport, card, and the usual ""please wait 2 minutes sir and you get your card""

Thirsty as hell after a long Barcelona day, 2 minyutes becomes 5.
Im standing there with so much heavy luggage, and ask if they need more time so I can sit down.
""No sir, says another person, just 1 more minute.

15 minute later, sitting myself at the restaurant area I get my card. ""sorry, new people here today"" Well, could they not tell me this so I could have sit down when I asked? I ask if I can get soem water, where ""Ainhoa"" responds: ""You have JUST waited 15 minutes""

Well, actually closer to 20 minutes where they told me 2 minutes.. So thank you for really bad customer service! 
Tired I ordered food, and on top of everything I get a dinner with a black (Im light brown) hair in my food. So disgusted I rolled the trolley (with the hair) back outside the door.

If any of the hotel people see this,  be may guest and enjoy my dinner - it`s still warm.",1,2014,07,04

Not be disappointed with choice of hotel and room at hotel ! Corner suites are bigger and sunny.
Can any one advise room numbers that were good choice",5,2014,07,03

Spectacular views, professional and very friendly staff, fantastic breakfast.The pool was not very big but quiet and modern for a city hotel.The hotel is not right in the city center but we liked very much to know the daily life offered by this district, just 5 minutes away you can found a street with a lot of charm where there is plenty of restaurants!! good choice, we will come back for sure!",5,2014,06,29
28,WONDERFUL CITY BUT AVERAGE HOTEL,"We were 2 couples staying at The Level, so we were taken at The Level reception to check in which was really slow. We were given a smelly room, dissabled room and not sea view either, for which we had booked and paid in advance. In the end we did get the room which we had booked but I was not impressed with the smell. The room and the bathroom was adequate size but the shower room was tiny. The bath products were very good quality and fragrance. Our TV was not working and they had to fix 3 times over 5 nights. There was not adequate variety at breakfast and sometimes it was cold. At The Level lounge, there was never enough quantity nor any selection of food for lunch or evening and there was hardly any choise for vegeterians. There was ample variety of drinks but not good quality. 
The view from The Level lounge was fabulous as you can see SAGRADA FAMILIA and AGBAR TOWER in a delightful ambience.",4,2014,06,20
28,Brilliant stay,"We stayed at the level with our son during half term. It's a brilliant hotel, and very accommodating of children. The room we were given was a suite overlooking the city and mountains. The breakfast was very good and we ate tapas at the restaurant too which were delicious. The pool are is lovely but the pool was a little fresh for my liking but our 7 year old did not care. The level lounge was always fully stocked and nothing was too much trouble. 
The hotel is a little way out but near a great beach and you can  walk in along the seafront which is a great trip",5,2014,06,16
28,As wonderful as the city,"We were two couple that visited Barcelona for the first time. My friend and his girlfriend used to stay at Melia in Bulgaria so he made all the arrangements – he is a big fan of Melia hotels. For me it was the first contact with Melia but I can say I was very impressed, starting with the lobby which is big and modern and more than that there 4 or 5 elevators. The hotel is not in the city center but is not far from it either – it took us about 30 min. of walking to reach La Sagrada Familia. We had the rooms at 28th floor – an absolutely unbelievable view on the city both by day and by night. Room was very clean with modern furniture and very comfortable king size bed. Since we were at The Level we had also access to The Level Lounge and Spa facilities all very nice and modern. The breakfast was very good with plenty of varieties and the one thing that I really enjoyed was freshly squeezed orange juice – you could really taste the orange in it. The staff was very helpful and always smiling helping us with directions or taxis whenever needed. I would like to send special thanks to Yolanda Grases that took care in setting us up in some very nice rooms.",5,2014,06,08
28,Fantastic stay in a great hotel!,"We were looked after from the moment we entered the hotel - level of service was excellent. We loved the 25th floor for socialising and the views. The facilities were great and the rooms were modern. We had a sea view, which was lovely. The food at the hotel was great.

One small critisism - our room reaked of cigars all of the time we were there.",5,2014,06,05
28,Great Hotel!,"This is a very modern and funky property. 
The room was large. The view are stunning from the tower. 
My room was a premium with free wifi (shakey at best), a large comfortable bed and a Nespresso maker. I only drew the net curtains and left the blinds open as I was on the 26th floor and there was no one in eye range. The view in the morning was fabulous to wake up to.
The bathroom was large and the shower was excellent - strong pressure and lots of hot water. The toiletries were lovely from TOUS Brand. My only complaint about the room was that I found the bathroom a bit on the dark side which made me shave on a touch complex. 
Breakfast was excellent - a huge spread of anything thing you could want with decent coffee to wash it down. 
We had a chance to see the restaurant on the 24th floor - WOW!!! The view is incredible.. However, as it was a Monday it was shut so we had dinner near the bar and where breakfast room was. The food was well prepared and very tasty.",5,2014,05,31
28,Great hotel!,"My husband and I are just back from an amazing break in Barcelona.

Since we entered the reception on the 25th floor at The Level at melia sky, we were welcomed by an amazing wood essence, everything about this hotel is beautiful and its staff can't do enough for you, you truly feel like royalty!, thanks to Yolanda who was our fantastic host during our stay.

Excellent breakfast, rooms and grounds, whether you're a childless couple, or a family it has something for everyone, couples, family and business.

It's worth every penny to have a 'Bali bed' experience with nice snacks and good cava, and you can't miss the great afternoon tapas at the level lounge.

We're very much looking forward to come back again next year!",5,2014,05,14
28,Beautiful Hotel and Room,"My friends and I booked 2 junior suite and a level sea view room at the level at melia barcelona sky for 2 nights and I have to say it was money well spent. Unfortuanitly I could not give this hotel a 5 out of 5 rating for just a few things that as a hotel manager myself would effect the service excellence of the hotel. The hotel is 2 hotels in 1. Confusing.....well just a little. We tried to check in on the ground floor were you would expect to but were told by receptionist that was not possible because we were staying at the level part of hotel and had to checkin on the 25th floor were the executive lounge is. This was fine and when we got there we were very impressed with the views and the lounge itself but I would recommend that they re-think doing this. To have 1 checkin desk were people are obviously relaxing with the complimentary drinks and food can destroy the atmosphere a little. Especially people with luggage and I can only imagine what it would e like on a busy day were you had a lot of people checking in at once with 1 desk. There was 3 of us checking in and took nearly an hour before we all got our keys for the rooms. But saying that once we got to the rooms I was very impressed with the quality of the Junior suite and the amenities available in the room. I could have spent the whole vacation in my room it was that nice. Even though we had booked the junior suite in advance I would reccommend everyone upgrade as the view alone of the ocean and the city combined was perfect. The only other negative feedback I would give this hotel is the interpersonal service from staff to guest. I requested an adapter that didnt arrive for until I called reception again 45 later and it didnt seem to bother them that I had waited that longer period or that they obviously forgot about it. 

So I would say if they twicked a few things like the checkin procedures and a more sense of urgency by the staff this hotel would be a gem of a hotel to stay in Barcelona. I will definatly revisit this hotel.",4,2014,05,13
28,Spectacular Views and Excellent Level Lounge,"We stayed at a Premium Double room with Sea View, which is more spacious that the City View rooms. Our room was on the 23rd floor with spectacular view. Check-in was in the Level Lounge on the 25th floor. Simone at the Level concierge desk was very helpful. The Level Lounge is open from 7 am to 11 pm. You can eat breakfast there, although we preferred the breakfast on the ground floor, because of extra choices. The Level Lounge provides tapas/appetizers from 1 pm to 3 pm and from 7 pm to 10 pm and drinks, little cakes/snacks throughout the day. The drinks included Wine, Beer, Scotch, Vodka, Gin, Campari, Peach Liquor and various soft drinks. The tapas/appetizers/dessert quality was better on some days than others, but overall was better than other hotel executive lounges on our trip. You have a spectacular view of the city and Sagrada Família from the lounge.  I rate the hotel 4.0 rather than 5.0, because the shower was too small for a 5 star hotel, the floors in the room looked dated showing stains, and the grout in the bathroom was cracked in some spots. However, overall the room was nice, the bed comfortable, functional work area, Wifi worked smoothly and the cleaning staff did a good job. The hotel is located in a business & residential area, however the L4 metro is 5 minutes away and it takes only a short metro ride of 4 stops to be at the heart of the Gothic Quarter. The metro is clean and gets you to all tourist attractions. I recommend buying the 10 Tickets card for 10 Euro that covers the metro, bus and train to the airport. The beautiful Mar Bella beach is an easy 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The excellent La Forquilla restaurant is 5 minutes away from the hotel.",4,2014,05,10
28,I'll come back!,"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel with friends to celebrate my birthday. The service is exceptional and extremely attentive. I was given a grand premium room in a high floor (26th) and it had an amazing view to the Sagrada Familia. The room was really comfortable and tastefully designed with space enough for 2 people. Housekeeping came by twice daily to clean the room and leave some chocolates which was a nice touch. Wifi was included in the price as I booked the room in the hotel's website. There is a swimming pool on the 6th flor and downstairs at the lobby there is a very cool and hip restaurant, on some days they do a showcooking, on the night that we went there it was sushi but I've read that they do ceviche as well. The location is a bit far from the city centre but you have a subway stop 5 minutes away which takes you directly in to downtown. I love staying at this hotel and I am looking forward to staying there again soon.",5,2014,05,07
28,A bit disappointing,"Home today after 3 nights at the Level.  When we arrived on Friday afternoon, check-in on the 25th floor was busy.  We were told to sit in the lounge until check-in was free.  We were a bit confused whether that meant we could go ahead and help ourselves to the complimentary drinks, we were just told to sit down.  There were a few staff walking around and they totally ignored us.  However, the views from the lounge were incredible.

Our room was on the 19th floor.  At first we were really impressed with the room but soon noticed that it was not up to the 5 star rating.  There was also a very powerful damp smell, which was also in the corridors outside the room.  The buttons for controlling the lights were a bit confusing as they didn't control what they said they controlled.  It was a bit rough around the edges and there were stains in the sink and shower.  The rain shower was ok and the hand held shower head did not work.  We were impressed with the view we had of the city though.  The bed was comfortable with feather pillows.  The room was quiet with no noise from either outside or other rooms.

We didn't really feel like going back up to The Level lounge again after being completely ignored on our first visit.  We had our breakfasts downstairs but trying to get tea from the waiters and waitresses was very difficult.  Jugs of coffee were brought round and there was a self service coffee machine.  There was a good selection of continental breakfast, pastries, bread, fruits and cereals.

We booked this stay directly on the Melia website in January and had been looking forward to it.  All in all, it was just a bit disappointing and not up to the 5 star rating.",3,2014,04,29
28,First Class Service,"Great service, great service, great service, is my mantra for 'The Level' - it was a lovely experience across the board, including an upgrade, the complimentary guest lounge, and the character and kindness of the staff at 'The Level'.

We stayed at the Barcelona Princess as well, which was really great, but we definitely stepped up in coming to the Melia.

The rooms were very good, but maybe not quite five star, but the service and the experience really made it a memorable stay :)

28,Excellent value for money,I booked through last minute and got a package for a premium room.  Although only £30 more for a 4 night stay you have free access to the Level 25 bar.  You can have free drinks (premium brands) and tapas like snacks all day.  The cakes in the late afternoon are divine-little macarons etc. My advice is to have breakfast in the ground floor dining room-there is much more choice. The rooms are not the most spacious but are perfectly formed and comfortable.  I have stayed at the W hotel and much preferred it here-felt you had the substance even if the style wasn't quite as wow! The area is out if town but is only about 10 mins walk from the metro. At the W we had to rely on taxis but that wasn't the case here.  Also the local area is up and coming and you feel as though you are at the heart if Barcelona-not just where the tourists go.  There are some excellent bars and shops springing up in the area.  Yes the check in isn't the fastest and the air conditioning took us 24 hours to work out but for value for money and service I couldn't fault it.  There is an amazing Michelin restaurant at the hotel-expensive but well worth it.  Try the testing menu-sublime!,5,2014,04,27
28,Needs a fresh up!,"We've been in this hotel a few years ago and liked it pretty much. As the offer was pretty good we decided to stay in a executive Junior Suite again. Unfortunately the time didn't pass without taking ist toll... Stains, stripes in the bathroom and not enough pressure for the rainshower to deserve the name were disappointing. Cold water (which means no shower at all for 12 hrs!) was down too and the snacks in the Lounge late, nice but not enough for all the guests.",3,2014,04,27
28,Incredible views and super friendly staff,"I couldn't fault this hotel (which is rare, I am fussy) and really enjoyed my stay. Room was modern, clean and comfortable and had views across the city. The loo seat was broken and there were no robes in the rooms, but neither was a problem. During our stay the staff informed us that the water was going to be turned off for a night, but they gave us plenty of water and were really apologetic.
    Food was beautiful and there was lots of drinks on offer on floor 25. Had a brilliant stay and staff couldn't be more helpful ",5,2014,04,26
28,"Lovely views, fantastic breakfasts.","A hotspot hotel in Barcelona that is only five minutes from the Metro and ten minutes from the beach. With stunning views and a lavish buffet breakfast this place is one to remember. A stylish, modern and relaxing setting for a short city break. ",4,2014,04,26
28,Not a five star experience.,"The rooms on the Level have amazing views across the city. The rooms are sealed and so you are reliant on good air conditioning which which was sadly lacking in one of our rooms (despite our elderly father and son being given another room in the hope of it being better.) We had to resort to asking for fans which took at least a day of our 4 night stay to arrive and the first was broken. Both rooms we booked were for 2 people but there was only one dressing gown in one room and none in the other. We had a coffee machine in one room but none in the other. The curtains which were supposed to open and shut automatically didn't anymore. We could have lived with or without these things and would probably not have made a complaint but for the awful SMELL of damp or drainage which wafts around the corridors of the hotel. When you can't open windows this is a real problem.
Most issues were eventually resolved and Yolande from guest services did provide us with complimentary champagne and strawberries. Would we stay here again?? - Probably not.",3,2014,04,19
28,Gem in Barcelona,"Spent the weekend at The Level with another couple.  Had booked 2 junior suites (nice amount of space to not feel cramped).  Loved the hotel!!!  Staff super friendly, location excellent for tram, bus or metro.  Staying at the level is the best value for money, as you have snacks and open bar all day (absolutely insane).  Hotel is in a very nice, chilled part of town away from the crowds.  Will definately return.",5,2014,04,15
28,5 star service but 4 star accomodation,"We have just returned from a 5 day stay at the Level (Melia Barcelona Sky). Overall this is an excellent hotel based just outside of the main city tourist area. There are adequate Trams and Metro services within easy walking distance of the hotel that allow you to get to central Barcelona within approximately 20 minutes.

The Level has a private lounge on the 25th floor that offers a good selection of complementary  drinks throughout the day as well as a quieter area to enjoy breakfast (although the downstairs restuarant offers a larger selection). The best feature of the Lounge are the very helpful staff that are 5 star in every aspect of their service and attention to detail.

The only part of the Level that lets the hotel down are the rooms. We stayed in 1913 (a premium sea view room). The bath had burn marks in it, the Ipod dock did not recognise my ipod, the shower and tiles within the bathroom area are in need of a good steam clean as they have orange residue and stains between most of the lower tiles (nothing a good clean or re-grouting wouldn't cure). The shower was also difficult to get to a usable temperature that remained anything near constant and the secondary hand shower did not work. The bed linen on our arrival had blood stains on it (these had obviously been washed but no one wants to find someone elses blood on white bed linen). We had previously stayed on the 13th floor (August 2013) and to be honest that room was of a better standard than the 19th floor one. Do not let the rooms put you off of the other great benefits that this hotel offers but given the chance insure you upgrade to one of the Grand Premium rooms.

Overall this is a great hotel that could be even better with a little love and attention paid to it's rooms.",4,2014,04,14
28,"Fantastic Little Break, could not fault the hotel in any way","Stayed here on the 27th floor, in a Level room which in lauded breakfast and access to the 25th floor lounge and all drinks and tapas through the day. Our room was fab, with iPod docking station, electric curtains, mini bar, flat screen TV, rain shower and modern bathroom. The bed was so comfy and the sheets so soft! We checked in at its' own unique check in desk after arriving early in the day, and our room was ready so we were all checked in by 11! And invited to use the lounge and pool. The swimming pool was lovely, with cabanas and sofas, plus us beds near the pool and towels provided, it was a real sun trap and got the sun all day. We had breakfast in the main restaurant on our first morning and the fresh orange juice was quality, and the servers keep you topped up with coffee : the fruit is fresh and there's a good selection of hot and cold foods, pastries, breads, meats, cheese, fish, yoghurts, you name it and you can sit indoors or outside on the patio area. We took breakfast the second morning up,on The Level and that too was very nice, with just the cold selections which suited us and we liked it better here due to the stunning views and tranquility. Credit to the servers and manager on The Level, nothing was too much trouble and they helped us with directions and a restaurant booking. If in Barcelona, stay here on The Level, you won't be disappointed. We got the bus over the road to the Nou Camp to watch the match and it's possible to walk to the Segrada Familia from the hotel.",5,2014,04,13
28,level up - chic 5 star,"The Melia Sky is a class act, Barcelona chic and style at a very affordable place. By signing up to Sky Level - from the 25 floor you get that bit more, your own check and free lounge with excellent food and drink - although take breakfast down stairs if like choice. The rooms are not large - but beautifully appointed and the views across the city are stunning. We tried the Michelin  started Dossenas restaurant and it was a michelin experience, the 100 euro tasting menu is outstanding and the service first class. The hotel is the Pobleneu district- a kind of aspiring Muswell Hill - good choice of eateries and bars and well serviced by the tube all together a great package. 0- one down point - check in can be slow - but the lounge is free so enjoy.",5,2014,04,01
28,Fabulous hotel,"We only stayed here one night, as we were in Barcelona for just the one night.  The hotel is a little distance from the city centre, but in our opinion, it is certainly worth the extra distance from the city centre.  It is only a short distance from the metro, and taxis were plentiful when we were there.
if you can, upgrade to the level.  It will allow you to access the executive lounge, which has fabulous views across the city.  Whilst you enjoy the views, you can help yourself to the tapas and drinks to your hearts content.
The only thing that disappointed us, was when we got back to the hotel Saturday night, we were looking forward to having a quiet drink in the downstairs bar, but the music was too loud for us (and we're not that old!)
the rooms were very clean, and the bed was very comfortable.
The service was excellent, and we would like to express our gratitude to Simone, who really went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our visit to Barcelona.",5,2014,03,19
28,Gorgeous Hotel... Stunning Views,"I have just come back form surprise 3 night stay in this hotel for my boyfriends 25th.. and what a surprise. Little reviews and pictures on this hotel so really relied on the professional photos and a bit of hope it would turn out to be as nice i wanted it to be! Stunning hotel, service is OK although we didn't really need much. Upon arrival we were sent up the 25th floor for check in, offered food and drinks and our first look at the specatular views! WOW! We stayed in room 2305 .. decent sized rooms bigger than i had thought. Lovely hidden shower .. good sized wardrobe.. toilet it a little small! The buttons at the side of the bed are a wicked touch being able to open and close the big revolving curtains from bed and adjust the lighting!

Beds and pillows are what ithink to be memory foam and SO comfortable!!! we had a greta nights sleep on our first night after a very early flight!

1 tip - DO NOT exchange money in the hotel.. a rip off is beyond words i've never known a hotel to have such extortionate exchange rates!

Great location although we rented out a scooter so we were off here, there and everywhere - if you are able to do with this with the correct license and aren;t scared of the lack of road laws that operate in Barcelona i would recommend this 100%  for 5 euros we had a full tank of petrol that lasted us the 4 days we were there for 50 euros to rent and we saw everyhting and everywhere it was a great expereince!!

We didn;t eat in the hotel other than in the mornings when we might go up to the 25th floor for a quick croissant and some cereal!

Can;t fault much at all about this hotel! The minibar is very expensive i wouldn't even bother! If so nothing more than a bottle of water. There is a massive shopping city to the right on the main road that has Zara, Primark, H&M, Bershka and many other great shops so we enjoyed some great discounts at the cheaper Euro prices!

As we were on the level we had free access to the pool (was too cold) Steam room, sauna and Jacuzzi... the Jacuzzi is lovely and at night is quite empty so we had it to ourselves every night which was lovely, your provided with flip flops and towles and a robe... they also have swimswear (Fresh) if you have come without.

Overall a great trip and a great hotel... If i do return to Barcelona i would most definitely stay here again",5,2014,03,18
28,Thank you!!,"Have just returned from a 4 day visit for my daughters 18th. Wow the staff were lovely and bent over backwards to help us. Nothing was too much trouble. We felt relaxed from the moment we arrived and were whisked up to level 25. What a haven. A big thank you to all the staff. Alexandra helped me take some amazing photos from secret areas and also helped me plan trips around Barcelona. The evening chocolate was a nice touch. Our only concern was the restaurant downstairs on the ground floor which we visited one evening. The menu was very limited and did not really live up the  quality provided by the rest of the hotel.
I will be returning very soon.",5,2014,02,15
28,I'll come back for sure!,"I still don't know how I have never check this hotel before as I am a frequent traveller to Barcelona. As soon as I Camerún up to the 25th floor and the elevator doors oponed I was like WOOOOOOW... The views are breathless... but one of the best things here is the fantastic team they have, Alejandra, Yolanda & Sergio are always willing to help you on everything, they got me tickets to a Barcelona football match and gave directions of the neighborhood because it was my first time in this area... One of them (Yolanda), took care of finding for me a beatiful bag that my wife asked me to bring back to Norway from an spanish designer and they found it for me and send someone to collect it from his boutique to the hotel... For me it was impressive because I was sure that I would yo back without it...
There is a pedestrian street full of nice restaurants in just a 5 minutes walk...
A little bit far from Barcelona's downtown but I didn't care because the subway station is also a 5 minutes walk and it takes 10 minutes to arrive, they also have taxis available 24hs outside hotel...
I will definitely come back again with my wife and would recommend to all my friends.",5,2014,01,19
28,A great short break in Barcelona!,"This is a lovely hotel.  It is out of the city centre, but it takes about 20 minutes into the Gothic area or to Sagrada Familia by public transport.  It takes even less time to get to Barceloneta.

The upgrade to Level is well worth it.  The staff in the lounge are very good - attentive but not over-attentive, the catering is very good and the lounge has fabulous views over to Sagrada Familia (as indeed my room did) In my view, that';s another advantage to being away from the centre of the city - you get to see it at sunrise and sunset!

The lounge also has good facilities - it's comfortable, has wifi access (as do the Level rooms) and is a good comfortable place to relax and to plan your trips around the city!

The room was very good - extremely comfortable bed, good coffee machine and housekeeping was excellent.

The spa is also excellent and well worth a visit, especially when you've just arrived and need to ""chill out""

The only slight downside was the meal I had in the hotel restaurant on the ground floor.  The food was OK but the service pretty perfunctory.  I was sat in front of the revolving door, so in a chilly position.  No-one checked to see if anything was OK with the meal.  This was a shame, as the restaurant was by no means busy, since it was out of season.

That said, I had a great trip away and would recommend this hotel to anyone going to explore Barcelona, whether for leisure or business.  As I said, the staff in the Level lounge were fantastic.",5,2014,01,15
28,Makes you feel special,"Great hotel! We were in the Level deal and were duly well impressed by guest assistance ... Lift from car park straight up to 25th floor to be greeted by champagne and a comfy sofa while all necessary paperwork for checking in was done for us..
Only 2 things in contra.. No wifi in our room on 18th floor even after assurance it would be dealt with on reporting and not possible to order a Sunday paper! ",4,2014,01,12
28,"""Well Done""","Just returned home from an excellent last minute Christmas break. We booked 15 hours before 
departure. 
I had a few worries regarding this property, due to the flight inclusive price, but my worries were to no avail....
We arrived and elevated ourselves to the ""Level"" on the 25th floor. Only to be greeted by Yolanda.
After 30 years in the London Casino business and 20 years as senior management, lucky enough to travel and stay in the worlds best hotels, I understand the importance and ethics of ""customer service""
Well she was the consummate professional, she made the ""Hotel within hotel"" concept believable. It was like being at home....on visits to the all inclusive lounge, I have a nasty habit of analyzing (sorry) even under the pressure of business and dealing with vile people, who are rude and demanding, she nailed it. I would most definitely employ her on my team.
Alexandra was great, unflappable and added that effervescence you need in a VIP lounge.
Sergio, I think he was the manager, was very kind and accommodating. Offering us late check-out and accommodating and helpful, even 3 hours after. Nice touch Sergio.

We only dined at breakfast, service and food quality of 5 star standard, perhaps cooked offerings could have been hotter.

We took an executive suite, which was trendy and ""Hi Tech"", It had a few issues, but nothing we couldn't live with...

We did not meet the General Manager, but had we have done, I would have said ""Well Done"" and your staff are a credit to your business.",5,2013,12,30
28,Great experience...,"Although away from action areas, thats helpful for tourists... the metro poblenou is 5 minutes walk.

Great viewa from room, helpful staff and great to have 18 hours of drinks, food and special lounge area complimentary.

We were vegies and the staff even got us a plate full of grilled vegetables everyday for breakfast.",4,2013,12,28
28,Experience is the name of the game,"I read tons & tons of hotel reviews on TA before booking my Barcelona hotel online. After finding a level city view room for a total of 180GBP (3 nights) I decided to take my chances with the hotel's location which seemed completely off and booked the room (lastminute.com).
After an early flight we arrived to the hotel at about noon, Lovely & gracious Yolanda welcomed us on the level (25th) floor, and to my surprise our room was ready and the keys handed to us! We got a room on the 19th floor with views to the north-west including La sagrada familia and many more. The room was the most modern I've stayed in including a set of buttons by our bed that controlled the lights and even the curtains. Very sleek & sophisticated (maybe even a bit too much…). There were 2 free bottles of water and a Nespresso coffee machine with 3 capsules which was a nice touch, also an iPod dock which did not seem to recognize my iPhone hence was not very useful to us. Later on (still on the day of our arrival) a housekeeper knocked on the door asking if we needed anything and brought some chocolate. 
I recommend eating breakfast at the dining room downstairs with one of the best selections of food  I saw in European hotels (very good cakes!). As for the level lounge, it is open 18 hours a day and serves all kinds of refreshments i.e. small sandwiches, cookies/ cakes, variety of fruit and on occasions even sushi. Also soft & alcoholic drinks including gin, vodka, scotch and rum. The lounge really comes in handy when you come from a long days' walk through the city streets and you want to relax & drink something before hitting the clubs…
As for location that was the thing that scared me the most before booking this hotel as it is situated in a business & residential area with no tourist attractions and decent restaurants.  Having said that, transportation to all parts of the city is very easy and handy including the metro yellow line (poblenou station is 5min. walk) & red line from glories station which is  12min. walk or 3min. by the T4 tram line which stops almost in front of the hotel on Av. Diagonal & Pere iv St. also if you are an enthusiastic shopper the hotel is situated exactly in the middle (10 min. walk from each) between Glories shopping center & Diagonal Mar mall, both offering a wide selection of shops & brands.  
To conclude, all in all the level offers a unique and extraordinary experience with great service and luxurious amenities. Highly recommended. Thanks again to Yolanda & the rest of the staff who made our stay unforgettable.",5,2013,12,24
28,"Sleek, Modern, & Exceeding Expectations","I've visited nearly 30 different countries now and, honestly, this is among the finest luxury hotels I've ever stayed in; it's sleek, modern design was perfectly to my taste, the staff were attentive and extremely helpful, the food was excellent, the hotel's facilities were all that I'd hoped for and more, and the view from my 26th floor room was breathtaking.

While the hotel is not the most centrally located, the city centre remains easily accessible by metro. As a base for a long weekend in Barcelona, however, it was ideal for me and my girlfriend. The Level staff were extremely generous with their time answering my emails before arriving in order to ensure the booking was to my specifications and also to plan a romantic surprise for my girlfriend in our room. The room itself, a grand premium city view room on the 26th room, offered an outstanding view of central Barcelona, an extremely comfortable bed, a dreamy rain shower, and very sexy interior design. 

Unfortunately we did not have a chance to sample Melia Sky's Michelin Star restaurant (Dos Cielos) during our stay, but the breakfast offering and dinner in the hotel's other restaurant (D02) were both very tasty. We did not have a chance to make use of the gym or the pool (though both facilities looked lovely) but we did enjoy a very relaxing experience in the hotel's YHI Wellness Spa. 

The only real faults I could find with the hotel were a spelling mistake on one of the signs in the spa and a disappointing instant hot chocolate one evening. These very minor criticisms are testament to the excellence of our experience. I would highly recommend this hotel for a romantic break such as ours or indeed for business or other purposes. 

Very special thanks to Guest Experience Coordinator Simone and to the beautiful Alejandra in the Level Lounge for helping to make our experience so special.

We will be back!

28,Only if the price is right (and don't give them your credit card at check-in),"Booked this as a lastminute.com top secret hotel and paid just £65 per night including breakfast in a level room. At this price, I can't complain too much, but if I had paid rack rate I would not be very impressed.

The hotel is out of the centre, but it's easy enough to get to by metro (a 5 minute walk away) or by taxi for around 10 EUR each way and there is a rank outside.

Emailed hotel before arrival advising it was my partner's birthday and requesting an early check-in. Also queried the amount they would put on hold on my credit card and I was advised that it would be 50 euros. 

Check-in was in the level lounge and pretty slow. Unlike other reviewers no complimentary drinks were offered, the room was not ready at 12:30 and no mention of my partners birthday. However, the receptionist was pleasant, helped to locate a shop we wanted to visit, charged our phone whilst we went out and took care of our luggage. 

Upon our return to the hotel our bags were already in our room which was a nice touch. Our room (2010) was next to a service elevator at the end of the corridor. The bathroom was not overly clean, with the previous occupants hairs around the sink. The bathroom was completely open to the bedroom, no blind or curtain for a little privacy. The toilet was the smallest ever. The shower did not maintain a constant temperature and ran for several minutes after being turned off.

The room (premium city view) was compact, but bright and modern in design. As others have said, the furnishings are showing their age and lots of scuffs, marks, chips etc. We could see the Sagrada Familia and Tibidabo from the bed and the tip of the Agbar tower (rest of which was blocked by a building site). The bed was very comfortable. The air conditioning was very noisy and had to be turned off at night in order to sleep. The remote control for the ipod speakers didn't work. There were only a handful of English channels and movies were 25 EUR. Free wifi was intermittent and rather slow. 

On the website it states that all level rooms come with a special welcome gift - we got one apple and half a strawberry. It also says they have Nespresso machines, pillow menu, bathrobe and slippers and aromatherapy kits - we didn't have any of this. 

The minibar was extortionately priced. 5EUR for a coke and 38.50EUR for a small bottle of Moet champagne. The room service was also very expensive- 18 EUR for a tiny club sandwich, but at least it was edible, unlike my partners barbecue beef pizza, which should be avoided at all costs. The breakfast was great, with a varied and plentiful selection (including doughnuts, cheesecake and chocolate cake!)

I borrowed an iron and an ironing board. The iron would not have passed an inspection, very dodgy cable with frayed wires.  

Our room included access to the lounge where drinks and snacks are provided free of charge, with wonderful city views. 

I handed over my credit card at check in believing that I would be paying a 50EUR deposit - they took £290 (the room was fully prepaid!) and it is now 5 days on and they have not given it back or responded to my emails marked urgent, the first of which was sent 32 hours ago. In addition to this, they have taken the 88EUR we spent on room service/ minibar.",1,2013,12,11
28,Do not recommend,"I spent the last week end in this hotel in Barcelona. We choose it based on the trip advisor reviews, which gave us the impression that the hotel and the service would be perfect.

Unfortunately, the service as not as expected. I made a sea view reservation, and I get a smoking room. They explained to me that I should have wrote to them during the reservation to ask for a non smoking room! They propose to change me from my room to a suite. The suite is very cold. When I turn the heat on, I get the smell of smoke from the smoking floor below. They change me again, and this is worse, the next room's heat does not work, and some of the room accessories are missing and it is not very clean. Many things in the room are not working (the coffee machine, the bath etc) and the finition is very bad. 

The second day, we take a breakfast in the room (which is charged on top of the already paid breakfast!). And when we come back in the evening the breakfast table is still in front of our door and the room as not clean (the floor has not been cleaned, despite the ""dirt"" from the breakfast.

By the way, the Hotel is everywhere cold! (Lobby, restaurant, etc). The only positive thing is the view from the room and the diner at the restaurant was very good.

I also felt the Hotel team did not care much about our dissatisfaction. I would not recommend this hotel! And I will inform my company to remove it from its hotel list.",2,2013,12,10
28,2 nights in Barcelona,We stayed here for 2 nights in late October 2013 before joining a cruise. It proved to be a great choice. Arrival was not 5 star  as there was nobody around to help us with our heavy bags. Location might not be the best for everybody but it suited us. Room was fine with a good view. Executive lounge was great with drinks all day and the range of food meant that you could if you wanted to manage quite happily without eating anywhere else. Good breakfast downstairs with particularly good fruit. There is a ( not surprisingly expensive ) Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel. Pool area was still open which we took advantage of as the weather was so nice. Our first stay at a Melia - we got a bit of a deal and paid just over £100 per night - we thought it was marvellous value as it included the lounge access.,5,2013,12,09
28,Disappointing,"I've been using Tripadvisor reviews to guide my choice of hotels for several years. Generally speaking I've found my experiences have been consistent with overall reviews. So I guess I've been lazy and have never posted a review previously, but this hotel made me change my mind and post a review, as my experience was so very different from others on this site.
The Level check-in is on the 25th floor. The staff are very polite and charming and they brought me a drink, but it was the slowest check-in I've ever experienced. I didn't have to wait because there wasn't anyone else being checked-in at the same  time, but it certainly took over 10 minutes. 
The room (level 19): a good size with spectacular city views. However it wasn't very clean - the entrance was very grubby; there was dried toothpaste around the sink; and I found a pair of socks on the floor next to the bed (presumably from the prevous inhabitant!).
There's a choice of breakfast venues: the main breakfast rrom on the ground floor, or up to the 25th floor for The Level lounge. The choice on L25 is pretty limited and doesn't get replenished. So the ground floor is a better option, but it's a very bland selection.
Soon after checking-in I received a welcome e-mail from the manager. I responded pointing out the problems with the slow check-n and the dirty room. A week later and I still haven't heard back from him. I know he received the e-mail as one of teh staff mentioned in when I checked-out.
A few other minor issues: the concierge service isn't very efficient; if you use their parking facility you can't get your parking ticket validated at the L25 lounge check-in: you have to go down to the main hotel reception on the ground floor. Hence I'm not sure the L25 check-in/out service adds any value.
On the positive side; the staff were all delightful and spoke very good English.
This isn't close to being the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, but in terms of the gap between expectations and reality, it's probably the worst hotel experience I've ever had.",2,2013,11,30
28,"A great vibe, great view and relaxing too.","A great place as a base for exploring the city. A decent walk (30 mins) from the centre, yet only 5 mins from places to eat too.
A contemporary, bold haven with great rooms and facilities. The pool is small but still a relaxing place to be, in the bustling city.",5,2013,11,27
28,fantastic,"The level experience was fantastic nothing was too much trouble.
The view from our rooms on floor 21 was amazing.
our beds were so comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud the bathroom was beautiful and after a good nights sleep we enjoyed a most enjoyable breakfast.
On our last day we thoroughly enjoyed the spa ending with a wonderful body massarge.
our wonderful time ended far too quickly.We plan to return next year.",5,2013,11,09
28,Fantastic,"I have attended to a meeting of my company and I've been upgraded to the level for free... It is fantastic, the lounge on the 25th floor with amazing views to the city is amazing, they have complimentary drinks and tapas so for me it was perfect to come up after our long meetings and have a glass of wine while I enjoyed the views to la Sagrada familia. The room had sea views so I could enjoy both views and have bathtub and shower, they are very modern and high-tech. If you go to melia sky ask for the supplement for a level room... it is worth it!!!",5,2013,11,09
28,Wonderful Stay!,"My sister and I were sailing on Holland America departing Spain in June 2013. Our travel agent recommended the Melia. Reservations were made and I contacted the hotel to request an upgrade to the Level. The hotel responded in a timely manner and provided information regarding the Level rates and amenities. It cost 49 Euros per night and included a free breakfast buffet which normally cost 24 Euros each and early check in/out which usually cost 39 Euros each. Since we were scheduled on an overnight transatlantic flight with arrival scheduled for 8:30 a.m., the early check in sounded inviting. We opted for the Level upgrade and have no regrets. We stayed in a wonderful room, had a tapas bar available each evening - also included in the upgrade. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated with a spa-like bathroom. Initially, I was disappointed to learn that the Melia was located in the financial district and not in the center of the city, but I later learned it is located near a high-end residential area. We took a short taxi ride to the center of the city, The Ramblas, and the Barcelon pier. We have no regrets about our hotel selection and found the staff to be courteous and helpful. (WARNING: My credit card number was stolen on this trip and luckily I had someone staying at my residence to get everything taken care of with my credit card company. I had been onboard the ship for 2 nights when I received this info. The only place my card was used was at the Melia and a shop in Provence. I find it hard to believe that the hotel staff or the kind shopkeeper would take the number and use it in a fraudulent manner - but who knows?!  So glad I took a second credit card!)",5,2013,09,17
28,Fantastic service!,"The level experience at Melia Sky is exelent.
Our familie of 4 stayed for 10 days and had a really relaxing and fun time.
I have several allergies and IBS. The level lounge provided gluten/lactose free food for me, and made me feel like a princess. I am often afraid to travel because of the food limitation but my stomach had a great holiday :)
I want spesially to thank Diego at the Level Lounge, he is very professional and friendly, he made sure that my spesial food was preparaded everyday. We stayed at the hotel last year but this year was better. The service and friendlines has emproved.
Thanks to Yolanda as well, she is great!",5,2013,08,21
28,Fantastic hotel in a busy city!,"Booked into the Melia Barcelona for two days after a cruise.
Its an oasis in the middle of a busy city.
We booked a junior suite which gets you access to 'The Level' VIP area and also free access to the spa.

The suite itself was lovely, It had a lounge, bedroom and beautiful bathroom.  The decor was contemporary and comfortable.

'The Level' was a really great experience, you can go in there anytime during the day and get different snacks/drinks associated with either breakfast/lunch/dinner.  Its very comfortable and the staff are so nice and helpful.  They could not do enough for you and were happy to chat about your day-all in all for the two days we were there it was like a home from home.

Breakfast in the hotel was nice also.  Its self service with a good variety of choice.  Again the staff are lovely and very willing to help if needed.

We ate in the restaurant for the two nights we were there as we were tired after walking around Barcelona all day, I would say it lacks a bit of atmosphere in the evening as for some reason it is not busy at night.  However the food was excellent on both evenings.

Location wise the hotel is not close to the central tourist areas of Barcelona, however reception staff advised us to leave the hotel, go two blocks and a 59 bus takes you straight to 'The Ramblas', it was very straightforward and we were there in around 10 minutes so no big deal.

All in all had a great trip and would recommend this hotel with no problems.",5,2013,08,16
28,Too bad the hotel can be safely ignored.,"Unfortunately, staying at Melia Level Sky in Barcelona leaves us a bit perplexed, because unlike other level stays in Frankfurt or Düsseldorf, our stay in Barcelona was a complete disappointment.

At check-in in the level area we accepted the offer to move into a junior suite for a small additional fee of 90.-. The room itself was spacious and quite tastefully decorated, but the cleanliness left a lot to be desired. A subtle layer of dust was noticeable in many places in the room - a pity.

After consultation from the reception team we had booked our included spa experience, but this was cancelled a few minutes due to technical difficulties..... something like this should not happen.

The level lounge is quite appealing, but the service is not available, dirty tables are not cleared or mopped, this should also not happen. 

The absolute low point, however, was breakfast, because it served platters of smoked salmon, which obviously had its best days behind it. Both the salmon itself and the prepared salmon sandwiches had probably not been cooled correctly, because the smell immediately showed that the salmon spoiled
war.
After being advised by several guests, the records were cleared immediately, there was no apology from the hotel, even the conversation during the checkout, during which I raised this issue clearly showed that obviously nobody feels responsible here and Customer Service is just a phrase. When asked ""Were they satisfied"" I honestly answered ""no"", but this did not entail any inquiries from the staff as to what problems there had been.

True to the motto: this does not happen in the standard template book, so I better ignore it.

I first had to proactively search for a responsible person here.

Too bad, as a rule we are always very satisfied at Melia Hotels, knowing that they are solid 4 star houses, where a certain level of standing can be expected.

The mail communication afterwards also clearly shows that only standard templates are used here, but the actual problem is not addressed in a customer-oriented manner at any point.",1,2024,08,30

28,"Unsafe hotel, tea is stolen from inside the hotel and they don't bat an eye.","Unsafe hotel. Impunity for robberies. A suitcase was stolen from us inside the hotel and we felt helpless. The hotel has done nothing to investigate it or compensate us. Total indifference.
First I want to acknowledge the positive. The rooms were very good. The restaurant and hotel services are excellent. The impeccable facilities. But we have lived an unusual and disappointing experience. ""Unsafety"". A suitcase was stolen from us in the lobby inside the hotel and the hotel has never given us an answer or cared about us.
Hotels (and even more so when they go above 3 stars) are “safe” places where we go to relax. Whether for work or leisure, when we walk through the doors of a Hotel, we feel security, hospitality, rest and pleasure.
Last May 26 (2023) we stayed at this hotel for the weekend.
It was my wife, two teenage children and me.
We arrived from the Canary Islands ready to spend some unforgettable days…
And so it was, but in the darkest and most negative of senses.
As you walk through the lobby doors. A doorman greeted us kindly.
We left our 15 and 14 year old children sitting in two of the seats in the lobby and the 4 suitcases right next to them while we headed to the separate reception desk just 5 meters away. Our stay at the counter was prolonged thanks to the fact that the person who greeted us in a friendly manner was ready to sell us several reservations to visit places of interest in Barcelona.
When we turned around to pick up our 4 suitcases… Surprise! one was missing. It had been stolen from us in the hotel lobby. But the most serious thing is that the other 3 were not where we had left them. The “doorman” admitted to having moved them from where we had left them in the protection of our children, to an area where they would be more “safe”… and from that area a suitcase was stolen from us (the most valuable of the 3 at first glance).
In the midst of our desperation, we recommended watching the cameras because it was clear that the robbery would be recorded on the security cameras. But they could not be seen if the complaint was not made.
At that time of night (8:00pm) look for the nearest police station.
More than 4 hours to file a complaint that has been of no use to us.
After 6 months neither the police squad nor the hotel has contacted us to give us an explanation, not even an apology from the hotel. It will be because according to a receptionist, the reception inside the hotel is a public place and they have no responsibility… we were left cold!
In short, we have lived the most negative experience of our lives in a hotel (and we know hundreds of cities and dozens of countries!!
Recommendations: even if you are inside this hotel, do not leave your luggage behind. And don't trust the doorman or the staff who are either very clueless, or are in cahoots with the thieves who stalk the hotel every day.
Thank you and I hope no one else suffers such an experience.

28,good option in Barcelona,"We have had a very good experience in this hotel. Although the location is not entirely central, it is compensated by the good rates they offer. The only recommendation would be to improve the cleaning of the rooms.

The most notable thing is the attention, we especially want to thank Lucia from the Level reception who has been super friendly.",4,2023,11,14
28,A lot of luxury but it lacks enough for my taste,"The hotel has everything to be TOP, but is the floor, for example in the rooms, uncomfortable for walking barefoot, closet without doors? horrible, worthy of a student hostel. I HATE liquid soaps. They left the cleaning supplies outside my room as if it were a deposit. And that I was in the 5 stars. IM not coming back anymore. I go to other MELIAs, yes.

28,Un equipo exquisito que hacen de esta experiencia un plus,"Nos alojamos por una noche en una junior suite en el Meliá Sky del 9 al 10 de enero.
La experiencia fue bastante exquisita, tanto por la ubicación del rascacielos como por el equipo humano que trabaja en este hotel. 
En la recepción nos atendieron Sara y Antonino, con su amabilidad y simpatía hicieron del proceso de check-in una experiencia rápida y útil donde nos explicaron todas las facilidades del mismo.
Nuestra suite estaba ubicada en la planta 21, con vistas a la ciudad de Barcelona y al monumento de Sagrada Familia. ¡Ver el atardecer desde allí fue hermoso!
Disfrutamos de los 30 minutos gratuitos por Level del circuito de aguas, ¡se nos pasaron enseguida!
Para cenar fuimos a Merkado, en la planta principal del hotel. La cena muy rica y el lugar acogedor. Destacar a Mariela que con su calidez y cercanía hiceron de la cena un 10.
A la mañana siguiente disfrutamos del buffet donde Evelina nos recibió con una sonrisa de oreja a oreja y nos sentó en una ubicación donde pudimos disfrutar de Poblenou y la hermosa costa de Barcelona. ¡El sol brillaba en lo alto del cielo!
Ha sido un acierto celebrar nuestro aniversario allí. Sin duda, repetiremos.",5,2023,01,11

28,Menuda decepción,"Esta era la 4a vez que nos alojábamos en este hotel y ha sido una auténtica decepción. Cogimos una habitación familiar y faltó mucho de lo que anunciaban en la web y que otras veces sí recibimos. No hubo copa de bienvenida ni agua de cortesía ni amenities en la habitación que, por cierto,  estaba precintada porque estaba ""higienizada"". Si la razón para suprimir todo eso era el Covid, podían haberlo avisado en el momento de reservar (antes de reservar por la web, llamé al hotel para preguntar los cambios por la pandemia). Además,  si había vasos sin envoltorio en la habitación, bien podían estar las amenities que vienen empaquetadas.
Cierto que pedí en recepción lo que necesitaba y me lo proporcionaron en seguida. Al poner la tele vimos que solo funcionaban los canales de la tdt así que llamamos a recepción donde dijeron que mandarían al técnico. Una hora después, bajó mi marido a recepción pues no había venido nadie. Y nos dijeron que no se veían porque no habían renovado la suscripción ¿?. La puerta del baño estaba sucia, como si se hubiera tirado café encima. Lo dije en recepción y me dejaron bombones y una disculpa pero la puerta seguía sucia. Por la mañana, para olvidar el mal rato pedí el desayuno en la habitación: bollería y tostadas. Como se ve en las fotos, el pan ni siquiera se acercó a la tostadora.
Me sabe mal porque ese hotel nos encantaba pero no creo que volvamos.  Aunque tengo que decir que todo el hotel es muy tranquilo y cómodo.
Por cierto, no dije nada del desayuno y de que la puerta estaba aún sucia porque al pagar nadie me preguntó cómo nos había ido.",2,2021,07,27
28,Barcelo del 9 al 15 de Julio del 2021,"Lo primero, somos clientes de la cadena MELIÁ desde hace bastantes años. Conocí el MELIÁ SKY en sus inicios cuando era Me. Lo que realmente valoro con un 5 ya que no puedo valorar con más estrellas, es el valor humano, la profesionalidad, y la respuesta.

La cadena Melia tras este tiempo duro, que ha pasado y pasa, mantiene a gran parte de su plantilla, excelentes profesionales en todos sus departamentos.

Nuestra experiencia en el The Level Sky Barcelona, fue creciendo día a día, la respuesta de los profesionales que allí trabajan, a la altura. Trabajadores incansables, y sin duda con ganas de trabajar y seguir dando el mejor servicio posible, pese a todos los inconvenientes de esta dura pandemia.

Tras un inicio, con pequeño traspiés, las soluciones llegaron inmediatamente. Todo, el personal excelente, the guest manager Alba, enseguida se preocupo por darnos una solución, contactactando con sus superiores, y sin duda supieron estar a la altura.

Habitación impecable, buena limpieza diaria. Desayuno fantástico, piscina maravillosa para relajarte despues del día en la ciudad. Gimnasio a la altura. El servicio THE LEVEL, fantástico, sigue estando a la altura.

Pero sobre todo, debo recalcar, la profesiónalidad de todos los trabajadores de este hotel, limpieza, camareros, recepcionistas, the guest manager, tanto Alba como Giacomo(disculpa si me equivoco con el nombre), recepciónistas(Hugo, un conocido del Melia Sarria), veo sobre todo muchas ganas de trabajar, y agradar a los clientes.

Señores de Melia, siguen manteniendo un equipo fantástico en sus hoteles, no los pierdan, es un valor para la empresa.

Volveremos. ",5,2021,07,14
28,NO ESTA A LA ALTURA DE UN 5*,"Un poco decepción. 
Check in perfecto, incluso nos dejaron entrar antes de la hora. Recepcionista muy amable y atenta.
Habitación amplia, limpia, y bonitas vistas. 
Escogimos servicio Level y MP el cual no nos sorprendió mucho. Se puede entender la situación actual por las restricciones COVID, pero esperaba más de este privilegio. El servicio de la planta 25 Level Lounge fue un poco decepción ya que no había apenas nada de snacks ( como publicitan), si que decir que habían bebidas y en el Tapas Times habian bebidas Premium.
En el Tapas Time ( 18-19:30) también un poco decepción. Pedimos repetir tapas pero tuvimos que esperar 15 minutos.
Spa pequeño pero correcto y limpio. 
La gran decepción fue en la cena. En absoluto la cena corresponde a un hotel de 5*. De menú nos ofrecieron 3 primeros a escoger( ensalada, croquetas de pollo y arroz a la cubana), de 2 plato ( salmón o pechuga de pollo) y de  postre ( pastel queso o ensalada de fruta).  Nos pareció vergonzoso en un hotel de esa categoría. En la cena nos incluía el vino, y la sorpresa es cuando el camarero nos trae las copas ya llenas. Por muy sencillo que fuera el vino, creo que se debería servir en mesa, delante del cliente.
A positivo decir que el desayuno en el Skykine 24, es variado, bonitas vistas a la ciudad.
Debo decir que para ser un hotel de esa categoría y optar por los servicios Level esperaba más detalles y mejor servicio.",3,2021,06,22
28,Mala experiencia.,"Realicé mi reserva en el hotel en el mes de Febrero, quería realizarle un regalo a mi pareja y que disfrutara de una estancia agradable y diferente, por tratarse de un hotel 5 estrellas con muy buenas opiniones.
En cuanto a la atención del personal, siempre estuvieron muy atentos, son personas agradables y cualquier cosa que necesitas te atienden a la brevedad.
En cuanto a las cosas negativas, en primera el mando de la tv no funcionaba, la nevera con que cuenta la habitación no enfríaba nada de nada, no pude beber ni tan siquiera una cerveza fría de las que ponen.
Ya a la noche, con mucha ilusión con la cena (sobre todo mi pareja) y para nuestra sorpresa, la calidad fue pésima. Mi pareja pidió ensalada cesar de primero, la lechuga parecía de varios días en una nevera, nada de lechuga fresca. Además, la ensalada no tenía pollo (según conozco todas las ensaladas césar llevan pollo). De segundo pidió una pasta que ni sabor tenía, en fin, la pobre no ceno nada.
En mi caso pedí un carpaccio de primero y venia sin sabor alguno, con unas hojas por encima. De segundo una carne que se dejaba pasar, resumen, cena pésima. Encima te dicen que la carta para la media pensión es diferente a la carta normal, y claro yo les dije, cuando realicé la reserva esto no se mencionaba en ningún sitio.
En fin, solicité hoja de reclamación para dejar todo por escrito y me dijeron que en ese momento no tenían, que tenia que ser al siguiente día. Al siguiente día cuando solicito la hoja me informan que me atenderá el Manager de Eventos, la persona muy amable y me comentó que sienten mucho lo que ha pasado, que tratarán de compensarme el mal rato invitándome a una cena o quizás dejarnos disfrutar de las instalaciones por un día. Para mi sorpresa después de una semana de espera lo único que recibo es un correo indicando que “sienten mucho el mal rato que pasamos, nada más”. Que en futuras reservas intentarán atenderme mejor.
En mi opinión, es mejor cenar o comer en un bar de polígono que no en el restaurante de este hotel. Si realizan una reserva, no paguen la media pensión, solamente el desayuno, que estaba bien.",1,2020,03,03
28,Un aniversario en pareja,"Estuvimos en julio para celebrar nuestro primer aniversario.

Mi pareja me regaló un ramo de flores que la chica de Guest Service había gestionado. Nos ofrecieron una botella de cava y unas fresas con chocolate, acompañados de una cartita. Nos gusto mucho el detalle y la atención.

El desayuno muy bueno, se nota que la clientela es de fuera de Europa ya que hay mucha selección de comida, asiática/oriental. 

El hotel dispone de terraza con piscina con barra. El mojito que me sirvieron sabía fatal (hay que formar al personal). El room service, muy lento. Pedí unas copas, nunca subió nadie.

La experiencia fue muy buena. El hotel es un poco caro pero merece la pena. Repetiremos sin duda!!",5,2020,03,02

28,Accidentada estancia,"Llegamos al hotel y por un error de comunicación, no estaban ejecutadas las peticiones que habíamos solicitado.

A pesar de todo, Sofía se encargó de todo para poder disponer de una habitación con bañera y poder cenar en la habitación cómodamente. Era un día especial y gracias ella todo se arregló. Gracias por ser cómplice de esta sorpresa.
En cuanto al buffet hay que decir que el espacio de la planta 24 es fantástico pero la disposición del buffet horrible. Al haber aprovechado la antigua cocina del restaurante 2 cielos se nota un problema de accesibilidad grave, falta de espacio, y de reposición de comida.

El servicio The Level sorprendió gratamente, acceso a bebidas y comida (desayuno, tapas y pica a pica) durante la mayoría de horas del día.

El SPA algo pequeño pero todo bastante nuevo y suficiente para relajarse unos minutos.

28,decepcionante y falsa descripción en la pagina oficial,"Realmente estoy muy decepcionado de haberme quedado en este hotel (siendo mi primera noche y no pudiendo irme porque he prepagado la habitación, si no, lo dejaría mañana mismo). Entiendo porque hay varios comentarios negativos que me hicieron dudar en contratarlo y hoy me doy cuenta que me equivoque

Detallo mi experiencia de atención en el hotel  en las pocas horas que he estado. 
1) Es la primera vez en mi vida que llego a un hotel de 5 estrellas y no tiene servicio de botones para recibir el equipaje  por lo cual subí a la recepción con mis valijas y luego las traje a la habitación. 
2) al hacer el check in, me ofrecen si deseo agregar el servicio de desayuno, le indico que no porque estaba incluido en mi habitación según describe en la pagina de melia del establecimiento y esta dentro de los beneficios de la habitación contratada. La  respuesta  del empleado era q es un servicio básico y que el desayuno completo se sirve en otro lugar. reitero, en la pagina describe en ""POR QUE ELEGIR THE LEVEL?"",dentro  del listado aparece ""Desayuno gratuito en zona privada"" y ""Acceso exclusivo a The Level Lounge"" como 2 items distintos. Parece casi una estafa que lo primero q ofrecen al llegar es contratar el desayuno. 
En el mismo listado entre varios de los servicios no brindados, se destacan,  ""Detalle de bienvenida en la habitación"", ""Servicio exclusivo de concierge"", etc. 
Quiero aclarar que al ingresar y luego hice el reclamo en la recepción y no tuve ninguna respuesta. Creo que el comportamiento del hotel es de mala fe y no se puede indicar que snack es un desayuno. Mas aun cuando se ofrece como un beneficio por contratar las habitaciones mas costosas. 
3) El aire acondicionado de la habitación hace mucho ruido al prender
4) el bano es realmente minúsculo, el habitáculo del inodoro aun menor. 
5) Las habitaciones solo se caracterizan por tener un buen diseño pero son  realmente muy básicas en calidad.

En fin, la piscina hacen eventos los fines de semana asi que es imposible acceder de la gente que hay.

Dann ging es gleich zur Tapas Time - hier hat man 1,5 Stunden Zeit sich durch die vielen spanischen Leckereien zu probieren und gratis oben drauf, gab es einen traumhaften Ausblick auf Barcelona und das Meer. Diesen Ausblick konnte man auch zum Frühstück genießen, denn das gab es auch in der SkyLounge 24. In der 25. Etage konnte man den ganzen Tag Getränke und Snacks genießen. Der Pool ist etwas klein, aber überhaupt kein Problem, man findet immer ein Plätzchen. Der Weg zum Strand ist mit 10 Minuten auch recht kurz. Die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel liegen auch gleich vor der Tür, somit kann man alle Sehenswürdigkeiten gut erreichen. Wir kommen auf alle Fälle wieder - super Hotel!",5,2019,07,27

Das Frühstück im Levelbereich war dagegen unzureichend, etwa gab es kein Ei. Für den höheren Preis hätte ich da mehr erwartet. Da ist das Melia in Berlin im Bereich Level um Längen besser. 
Die Lage des Hotels ist super. Zu Fuß zum Strand dauert es nicht mal 10 Minuten.
Fazit: Es lohnt sich also das Hotel zu buchen. Level kann man sich aber hingegen sparen. Geht von dem Geld lieber lecker Tapas essen.",4,2019,06,05
28,Gutes Hotel mit schöner Aussicht,"Das Hotel wurde meiner Meinung nach für Männer gemacht. Der Spiegel fehlt, im Bad ist ein winziger Spiegel, der für die Rasur reicht. Putzfrauen grüßen nicht. Und der Cappuccino wird lieber aus der Küche geholt (schmeckt nicht) obwohl Espressomaschine und Aufschäumer bereit stehen.Das Frühstück ist gut da viel Auswahl. Der Ausblick ist sehr schön und die zwei Damen an der Rezeption im 24. und 25. Stockwerk waren sehr freundlich. Dafür die drei Sterne.",3,2019,06,05
28,Relax,"Muy recomendable, bonito, luminoso, en zona bien comunicada, vistas muy especiales de Barcelona.
Estupenda Marina Prior del Spa.
Servicio amable, atento y rápido.
Para quedarte y no salir del Hotel.
Desayuno y coctel de la tarde muy correctos.
Un buen lugar para pernoctar en Bcn.",5,2019,04,27

Recomiendo!!!",5,2019,03,18
28,Muy bien...,"De pasada por Barcelona he llega este Hotel, moderno en Pueblo Nuevo. Fuimos recibidos en el piso 25 por dos atentas chicas y ricos refrigerios, infusiones y otras bebidas.
Nos habilitaron la habitación en muy poco tiempo habiendo llegado muy temprano y un masaje en el Spa matizó la entrada, después del largo vuelo, a la habitación.
Una carta redactada por una de las chicas: Carolina García, quien me acompañó hasta el Spa; me sorprendió agradablemente: en ella me indicaba la habitación que ocuparía, me informaba que mi esposa se había retirado a descansar y me deseaba un buen masaje. Qué detalle!
La habitación si bien un poco angosta, muy limpia y el baño amplio.",5,2019,02,27
28,Escapada desconectada !!,Me encanto el hotel unas vistas a toda la ciudad espectacular !! El servicio muy bueno Jordy y Carolina García encantadores nos ha guiado y sugerido Buenos sitios donde comer y disfrutar  el gimnasio bastante completo para quemar las calorías de los manjares !! Jajaja 😂,5,2019,01,27
28,Excelente hotel,"Simplemente magnífico!! Las vistas son espectaculares  , el desayuno de muy buena calidad!! La habitación es amplia, limpia con una cama muy comoda! Lo único negativo es que en la.descripción de la habitación pone que hay productos para el baño de loewe, pero no es verdad ( no es que me importara mucho, pero no creo que os favorecen ésa clase de cosas) !! GRACIAS por una estancia super agradable!!",5,2019,01,07
28,"Tolles Hotel, netter Service , gute Extras","Wir haben unseren Barcelona Städtetrip mit einer Woche in diesem Hotel verbracht. Die Extra Leistungen für den Sky Level haben den Aufenthalt zu einem echten Erlebnis gemacht. Natürlich sind die Zimmer im Vergleich teurer, aber der Ausblick, die freien Getränke und Tapas im Level, als auch der Zugang zum Spa, haben sich gelohnt.",5,2018,10,26
28,excelente estadia¡¡¡¡,"el hotel es hermoso , se accede al piso 25 donde se hace el check in directamente desde el parking,las vistas ,tamaño de la habitacion increibles,viajamos con mi hija de 5 años y tenia un lugar independiente para dormir sillon cama en el comedor .baño con doble ducha, bañera amenoties de calidad.estuvimos alojados en una junior suite ,impecable.desayuno digno de un 5 estrellas .de 17 a 1930 bebidas y tapas sin cargo en el piso 24 , de nuevo las vistas increibles ,techo corredizo .espectacular¡¡¡¡¡",5,2018,09,17
28,Tolles Hotel mit super Service,"Wir hatten insgesamt 3 Zimmer auf den Etagen 28, 23 und 24. Alle drei hatten einen wunderschönen Ausblick auf die Stadt und waren bereits vor der offiziellen Check-In Zeit fertig. Auch die jeweils im voraus gewählte Bettenkonfiguration (ein Kingsize und zwei getrennte Betten) hat gepasst.  Besonders beeindruckend war der Ausblick, das Angebot und der Service in der Level Lounge und in der 24 Cielos Panoramaterrasse, wo auch das Frühstück eingenommen werden kann. Alles in allem tolles Hotel in schönem Design mit außergewöhnlich freundlichem Personal.",4,2018,09,16
28,Pesimo. Ni un hostal,"Decepción absoluta en este hotel de Melia. Soy Melia Platinum y es el peor hotel de la cadena. Empecemos. Servicio. Todos chavales de entrenamiento que no saben ni español, ni saben expresarse y están nerviosos. The level: cualquier hotel/hostal tiene mas detalles en el lobby que este The Level (bebidas calientes y almendras). Piscina. Ocupada por un evento un martes por la tarde y literalmente me prohibieron la entrada....
Y para rematar... una cucaracha en la habitación. Ciertamente para no volver jamás. Una pena que Melia permita esto. ",1,2018,09,16
28,Me ha encantado,"Excelente todo el hotel. The LEVEL espectacular. Desayuno fantástico y por supuesto me quedo sobre todo con el personal es MARAVILLOSO

28,Ottimo soggiorno,"Hotel della catena Melia Hotel sicuramente di livello superiore.
Hall importante anche se  il chek in delle camere ""Level""  viene effettuato al 25° piano dove ubicata la lounge .
Camere ampie,pulite con bagno ampio e ottimamente accessoriato.Letto comodissimo,come da tradizione Melia e vista spettacolare dal 20° piano .
Fantastico l'happy hour organizzato tutte le sere sulla terrazza del 24° piano dalle 18 alle 19,30 .
Fantastica anche la colazione con piatti dolci e salati ,preparati anche al momento e buon assortimento di frutta.
Nel complesso ottimo soggiorno",5,2018,09,13
28,SKY,"tra i milgiori hotel di barcellona dove ho soggiornato. non tanto per la posizione,nel poble nou, ma pe ril servizio,l'architettura design moderna dell'hotel,le viste dai piani alti e la piscina lounge. camere non molto grandi ma disegnate bene,arredate e moderne. servizio di cortesia e business quasi 24 su 24.ottima e curata  la prima colazione in attico con tanta scelta,servizio e vista sul mare e barcellona. ci tornerei",5,2018,08,12
28,Beindruckend schlecht.,"Ich Reise Beruflich viel und wollte meiner Familie Barcelona zeigen. Die Auswahl viel auf das ""The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky"" und ich kann meine Enttäuschung kaum in Worte fassen. Das Top-Angebot, die Executive Suite im 22 Stock, besteht aus einen Elternbett sowie einem Schlafsofa aus Schaumstoff welche nur für den älteren Sohn (18/192cm) reichte was bedeutet, der kleine (10/150cm) muss ins Elternbett. Innerhalb von 10 min Zimmer reklamiert (extremer Rauchgeruch und extrem schlechte Luft) Nachdem kein anderes Zimmer, mehr Platz bieten konnte, mussten wir das Zimmer nutzen, obwohl die Klimaanlage defekt war. Nach 4(!) Tagen wurde die Klima Anlage repariert, mit dem  Erfolg das die schlechte Luft jetzt wenigstens Kühl war. der Pool, welcher gerne noch für externe Partys vermietet wird, ist eine einzige Partyzone wo normale Familien nicht hinpassen (nur Paarungswillige, betrunkene Engländer und spanische Bodybuilder) die Ihre gebrauchten Kondome gerne mal in der Ecke liegen lassen. (mein älterer Sohn frage, ""Drehen die hier Pornos?). Unsere Suite hat die besten Tage hinter sich, vor dem einzigen Bad für vier Personen lösen sich die Bodenfliesen ab, und das Rollo vom Badezimmerfenster (Fenster zwischen Bad und Schlafzimmer) ist defekt. Das Highlight sind aber die 4 Aufzüge von denen zwei in Reparatur sind und auf die man gerne mal 8min (wir haben gestoppt) warten muss, um anschliessend, in gefühlten 42 grad ohne Lüftung und auf jeder Etage haltend seine Zeit verbringt oder über den betrunken Engländer, welcher auf dem Fahrstuhlboden liegt, lacht und den Kindern erklärt das Alkohol so etwas anrichten kann, schön ist anders. Dieses Hotel wird nicht geführt, jeder ist wichtig, keiner hat etwas zu sagen, keiner ist verantwortlich, ich habe mich, für die Wahl dieses Hotels, vor meiner Familie geschämt. Dieses Hotel würde nicht mal einem 3Sterne Hotel gerecht. Ich kann diese Hotel nicht empfehlen, muss eigentlich vor diesem Hotel warnen.",1,2018,08,08
28,Muy Mal Aire Acondicionado,"Es un buen hotel, con amplia vista a la ciudad.
Su diseño moderno puede ser un poco incómodo si vas en familia, pues el baño está integrado a la habitación.
El Desayuno es lejos lo más destacado junto a un sistema de snack permanente y acceso al bar en determinado horario, lo que se incluye en el precio.
El personal no destaca por su amabilidad y detalles para un 5 estrellas. Cuando hice el check out ni siquiera me ofrecieron apoyarme en la salida con las maletas, lo que me pareció curioso.
Lo que deben mejorar de todas maneras es el aire acondicionado que no tiene la capacidad para  enfriar habitaciones y pasillos, lo que en verano es definitivamente un problema!

Esta ubicado en un sector residencial a unas cuadras del metro, lo que es una gran ayuda en conexión.

",4,2018,08,03
28,Buena ubicación!,"Nos hospedamos varias veces en el Hotel. El desayuno es buenísimo, la atención en los bares y restaurante es excelente! La piscina y el bar están muy bien aunque un poco saturados de gente. La limpieza de habitaciones y el servicio de house keeping es bastante regular, hay que insistir en detalles o que te repongan el agua del minibar, los horarios para que las habitaciones esten hechas, etc. Fuera de eso el Hotel es muy bueno y lo recomiendo!",4,2018,08,02
28,Piscina ocupada,Decepción. Hotel repleto de turistas. No pudimos utilizar la piscina exterior que forma parte de las instalaciones del hotel porque hacian una fiesta privada con dj y estaba totalmente ocupada. Lo único favorable es la atención del personal que es muy amable pero la política del hotel tendria que mejorar mucho para merecer las 5 estrellas.,1,2018,07,26
28,The Level no vale la pena.,"Soy cliente platinum de Melia y decidimos alojarmos en el Barcelona Sky puesto que no lo conociamos y parecía un hotel interesante. A decir verdad, que tuviera piscina fue determinante pues vamos con un niño y es lo que mas le gusta.
Reservé habitación level porque conozco el sistema y está bastante bien, planta 23 nos dieron.

Llegamos y en la piscina hay una fiesta privada llena de niñatos. Nos comentan empleados que es algo habitual, nada puntual que hubiera sido mala suerte, es que la piscina del hotel practicamente la revenden a gente de fuera. Ni sentarte en una hamaca podías. Gente fumando dentro de la piscina. Obviamente nos fuimos de allí. Increible es poco.

Fuimos luego a The Level y para el que conozca el sistema, magnífico en otros hoteles de la cadena, se llevará la decepción de su vida. Nos acercamos a las 21,00 y no te puedes ni tomar una cerveza fresca. Resulta que abren en un horario limitadísimo, no se si nos dijeron de  5 a 7 o algo así, y si no estás en ese momento ya te lo has perdido. Creo que había un tarro de frutos secos y un par de refrescos. ¿Cómo puede haber tantísima diferencia de un hotel a otro? Veniamos del The Level del Melia Madrid Serrano y es como pasar del día a la noche. 

En lo referente a la habitación np tengo ninguna queja, justo lo esperado en The Level como en otros hoteles Melia.",1,2018,07,08
28,Lujo de alturas,"Y vistas sobre la ciudad y el mar en la cálida habitación de la planta 19. Buen servicio, comodidad y confort remarcables en este hotel, el Level, situado a partir de la planta 25 con acceso al lunch de la misma planta y durante hora media por la tarde, con snacks y bebidas,  en la planta 24 con grandes ventanales y vistas de ensueño a toda la ciudad. Un rascacielos de formas atrevidas, unos 12 metros de ancho por una importante altura y una experiencia muy agradable, placentera. Acceso al spa muy bien dispuesto , una pequeña pero suficiente piscina de 1,20 m de profundidad, hamacas resguardadas y buen ambiente. A recomendar para una salida romántica en la propia ciudad. El desayuno, en la p.24, muy buenos embutidos ibéricos , pastas, huevos, lo que no el zumo de naranja, prescindible, pero sí un riquísimo zumo natural de sandía o melón. En cuanto a los snacks, muy simples y poco variados, nada del otro mundo. El sueño en la cama fue magnífico, el aire acondicionado en su justo punto y la habitación, de carácter minimalista, con una gran pantalla de TV y un ventanal abierto al baño muy completo, quizás un pelín estrecha de medidas.  En definitiva, buena elección. En frente pueden pasear por el bonito parque, creación de Jean Nouvel!!!",4,2018,07,03
28,Discriminación,Resulta que pagas una habitación en el level y luego nos echan de las hamacas de la piscina porque va a empezar una fiesta el domingo a las 15h de la tarde y tienen preferencia los niños que vienen a la fiesta y a los clientes nos arrinconan al final de la piscina justo al lado de la puerta de salida. Soy de barcelona busco calidad y tranquilidad con mi pareja y me encuentro con esto!!! No lo vale ,1,2018,07,03
28,Una verdadera decepción,"Como cliente platinum de Melia que soy me cuesta escribir esta opinión, pero la decepción llegó a tal nivel.
Nunca había viajado a Barcelona hasta la fecha pero siempre he tenido claro que ""el día que tenga que ir a Barcelona, me hospedaré en el Sky""... y así lo hice. Subí por trabajo en Martorell y aún teniendo el hotel pagado por mi empresa en Martorell, lo rechacé por probar este. Y a que mala hora.
Llegamos sobre las 22hrs y nos atendió el equipo de The Level, realizamos el checkin y nos tomamos un refresco en el lounge the level. Primera impresión: se nota que estamos en Catalunya: escaso en todo excepto en vasos vacíos llenos de polvo. 4 aceitunas contadas junto con una selección de refrescos calientes.
Como aún no habíamos cenado, bajamos a cenar y nos encontramos con que no había menú de alérgenos (mi padre tiene alergia a la lactosa) y con el comentario de la camarera de: ""aquí todo se cocina con mantequilla"". Después de pedir un poco de pan con tomate y unas patatas con huevos rotos, nos dirigimos a la habitación.
Sorpresa: los huéspedes anteriores habían fumado en la habitación y además el servicio de habitaciones se había dejado un botellín de fanta en el lavabo. Bajamos a recepción y nos cambiaron a otra habitación... y como no, sorpresa: puerta del armario rota y mango de la ducha roto...
Desayuno: el único punto positivo y que realmente cabe destacar de mi estancia en el hotel. Personal atento, show cooking para tortillas y amplia variedad.
The Level Lounge: Se podría llegar a definir como inexistente. Tanto a los lectores de esta opinión como a los directores del hotel, os recomiendo encarecidamente visitar el Melia Madrid Serrano. Supongo que como empleados de Melia tendréis descuento y de esta forma poder experimentar una verdadera experiencia Level.
En resumidas cuantas, la dirección del hotel deberá plantearse seriamente en qué rumbo desea llevar su hotel, porque, en este momento, no representa a Melia Hotels International.
Desearía agradecer a Alba (Guest Experience) su dedicación y humildad a la hora de tratar nuestro caso. Si vuelvo al hotel será por ella y por su compromiso de que las cosas van a cambiar. Espero que sea así y le deseo todo lo mejor.",1,2018,07,02
28,"Hotel muy bien ubicado, buen servicio de habitaciones. El servicio del piso 25 level",Destacable el excelente trato recibido en el desayuno. Sobretodo por una camarera llamada Beatriz. Recordaba los nombres y las preferencias y hasta me preparo un minifestejo de cumpleaños con torta y champaña. En general todo el personal muy atento,4,2018,06,07
28,Todo sigue igual de bien...O mejor...,"Suelo ir al hotel frecuentemente y sigo sin tener queja alguna. Magníficas instalaciones y un personal de diez, lo  mejor del hotel y lo que, sin lugar a dudas, marca las diferencias con el resto de hoteles en los que he tenido la oportunidad de alojarme. Agradecimientos especiales a Yolanda, de recepción, que siempre que voy esta pendiente de todos los detalles para hacer mi estancia lo mas agradable posible.",5,2018,05,10
28,Espectacular,"He estado varias veces el el hotel, es genial,la verdad es como estar en tu casa, el hotel y las instalaciones son espectaculares, el trato es fantástico,además siempre que voy me ha atendido en la recepción Yolanda, y es muy simpática, muy agradable y muy amable, te ayuda siempre en todo. Todo lo demas super bien, el spa y todas las instalaciones están muy bien.",5,2018,05,05
28,Excelente alternativa Meliá en el Sky-line de BCN.,"Excelente estancia a líneas generales en la ciudad de Barcelona.

- Check-in/Check-out: Recepción ubicada en planta 25 servicio The Level. Atentos, muy educados y en el que el trato personalizado hace que tu estancia sea como si estuvieras en casa. 
- Habitación: Hospedado en una Junior Suite, destacar la amplitud de la misma, la limpieza y la comodidad de todos los rincones de la habitación que van desde la cama hasta el amplio baño y salón. 
- Instalaciones: Imponentes, modernas y vanguardistas. El edificio en sí es un símbolo que gana altura en la ciudad de Barcelona tanto por su diseño exterior como interior. 
- Restauración: Muy buen servicio desde la planta dónde se ubica 24 cielos. En primer lugar, por el servicio The Level con aperitivos y consumiciones que se ofrecen desde las 19h a las 21h. Y en segundo lugar por el desayuno-buffet con gran variedad de fríos, calientes, bollería/pastas y show cooking. La verdad es que desayunar teniendo Barcelona a tus pies es un regalo para los sentidos.

A continuación destaco detalles o puntos de mejora:

- Párquing: Aunque es un párquing amplio en el que accedes directamente al hotel con el ascensor, me parece excesivo que por cada noche se cobren 27 euros. Y mucho menos siendo socio identificado de Meliá Hoteles. La tarifa diaria debería ser mucho más ajustada a la realidad. Diferenciemos clientes externos no alojados de clientes alojados y siendo además como decía socio de Meliá Rewards. Una tarifa plana o cerrada a noche de alojamiento es más que evidente que se debería concretar sabiendo que en la misma ciudad y en otras ubicaciones se ofrecen tarifas que van desde los 10 a los 15 euros como mucho.

- Habitación: Es una lástima que habitaciones de categoría superior contratadas como la que escogí yo, no dispongan de bañera de hidromasaje con el precio que  estás pagando. Si bien es cierto, los detalles y categoría de baño junto a los amenities es reseñable, aunque una Junior Suite debería venir de serie más allá de una bañera clásica. 

Sin lugar a dudas, recomiendo la experiencia de Meliá Barcelona Sky que con el plus The Level lo hace más singular aumentando la satisfacción notablemente.",5,2018,05,02
28,Increíble!,"Mi pareja y yo buscabamos una noche para alejarnos del estrés de la rutina y no pudimos acertar de mejor manera.

El servicio ofrecido por Anna Muñoz y Javier Morón fue excelente, haciéndonos más comoda nuestra estancia.
El general, personal ha sido encantador, siempre atento a las necesidades. 

Mi parte favorita ha sido la habitación, con vistas a toda la ciudad. Aunque sin desprestigiar al servicio Level, ni el desayuno con espectáculo. 
Por suerte escogimos buen tiempo, lo que nos permitió disfrutar de una maravillosa piscina con chill out. 
Sin duda repetiremos, ya que se localiza en una zona muy centrica y accesible con transporte público.",5,2018,04,29
28,"Es otro ""nivel""","Su nombre le va bien. Cuando entras en The Level, todo está a otro nivel. El tamaño de las habitaciones, las amenities, los jabones y geles de Loewe, la amplitud de las duchas (hay dos), el espacio,... en definitiva otro concepto. Me tocó un upgrade de una noche del hotel Meliá Sky al The Level y ha sido toda una experiencia. Cuidan mucho los detalles. Excelente. ",5,2018,04,16
28,Falsche Versprechungen wurden gemacht. Kein Mitgefühl.,Wir haben falsche Versprechungen vom Hotel erhalten. Das Management hat kein Mitgefühl für Menschen mit kleinen Kindern. Ich würde mich an eurer Stelle schämen. Deshalb boykottiere ich dieses Hotel und empfehle Abstand davon zu halten.,1,2018,04,13
28,Estancia Increíble en el cielo de Barcelona,"Hace unos días estuve alojado en el Barcelona Sky durante dos noches con mi pareja. Realizamos una reserva en las habitaciones The Level y se nos asignó una habitación en la planta más alta, la 29. Las vistas son increíbles! y la habitación muy bien decorada y equipada. El desayuno en la planta 24 fue magnífico y los aperitivos servidos de las 19h a las 21h también fueron excelentes. Sin duda, destacar la asistencia de nuestro Guest Experience Llorenç, quién nos cuidó y nos hizo sentir como en casa! Sin duda volveremos.",5,2018,04,03
28,Excelente,"La recepción está en la planta 25 junto con un espacio para tomar algo de forma gratuita que no llegamos a pisar.
Nuestra habitación en la planta 28 con unas vistas de escándalo de Barcelona.
Desayuno Buffet en la terraza de la planta 24. El zumo y el café te lo traen a la mesa y en la cocina ponen el Buffet muy bien surtido y de calidad. Realizan al momento una serie de platos siguiendo tus indicaciones.
En esa misma terraza de 19 a 21h hay un servicio gratuito de aperitivos y bebidas. Son unos pinchos de gran calidad que reponen constantemente.",5,2018,03,18
28,Calidad-precio excelente(con matices),"Si contemplas desde tu cama en el piso 20 el mediterráneo uno se siente un poco dios,es lo mejor de este hotel,las vistas.El level de melia siempre se agradece,desde el check-in,el lounge con bebidas y snacks casi todo el día,y unas habitaciones remodeladas y puestas al día.Hay que destacar también la amabilidad de todo el personal,ejemplar.Por este precio es una ganga todo lo que ofrecen,y por esto no esta todo como tendría que ser,el buffet desayuno esta presentado en un espacio demasiado reducido,atendido por personal de trabajo temporal que no sabían muy bien como atender todo el comedor(bastante caos,sin cubiertos,una lleva una cosa,preguntan,no saben(esto si,com una sonrisa y amabilidad)daba pena ver este comedor tan espectacular tan mal organizado.En la web de melia salen fotos del cuarto de baño con amenities de Loéwe,en realidad son de la marca del hotel,en la web tambien ofrecen 20 euros(si reservas a través de su web) para gastar en el hotel,que después en el check-in no mencionan.Pero en general el hotel realmente vale la pena,por este precio es difícil dormir mejor y sentirse en el cielo en barcelona.Un saludo.",5,2018,03,12
28,VISTAS INCREIBLES Y CUIDADO POR LOS DETALLES,"Las vistas desde la recepción del Level Lounge son increibles, la atención del personal y su educación y profesionalidad son inmejorables. Las habitaciones The Level tienen una ubicación y vistas magnificas, estan perfectamente dotadas y las atenciones son muy buenas. El desayuno, desde la planta 24, muy variado y con productos de alta calidad.
El unico pero es que esta un poco alejado del centro de Barcelona, pero no faltan taxis a la puerta y hay varias lineas de atunuses y tranvia a la puerte
Hotel para repetir con buen tiempo y aprovechar la piscina.",5,2018,03,04
28,INCREÍBLE,"El hotel es increíble, la zonas level impresionantes.
La comida muy rica y variado , el personal muy amable y atentos.
Recomiendo level 100%
Un hotel perfecto para un fin de semana romántico en pareja.",5,2018,02,27
28,Estadia en Hotel,Excelente bajo todo punto de vista....comedor...habitacion....personal...amabilidad.....comunicacion...servicio...recomendable 100%. Chek in y out muy bien todo. Queda todo cerca de la ubicacion cerca todo para ir caminando y conociendo,5,2018,02,24
28,"Mal, mal, mal","Viajamos mucho con mi marido y como siempre escogemos un Hotel Meliá. Bueno...una pesadilla! Unos amigos vinieron aquí el año pasado y nos recomendaron este hotel....Bueno, una pesadilla. Lo que es la restauración es un caos! Poca organización, malos modales, confusión y excusas. Ojo, el personal de servicio hace lo posible, pero se nota la falta de organización. Las habitaciones correctas y check in/out normales.
No lo recomiendo.",1,2018,02,12
28,Una estancia estupenda,"Me alojé 2 días en una The Level Junior Suite la primera semana de febrero para celebrar mi cumpleaños con mi pareja y ha sido una experiencia muy positiva, muy contento con la habitación y el hotel en general, sin olvidarme  de la atención del personal, todos muy amables y atentos, dar las gracias en especial a Yolanda y Abdelhak, personal de The Level por su trato inmejorable.

A mí estancia le pondría dos peros. El primero fue el desayuno, que nos lo dieron en la planta baja en vez de en la terraza de la planta 24, nos comentaron que esta temporada lo habían cambiado y hasta dentro de unas semanas no volverían a dar el desayuno en la planta 24, una pena porque nos quedamos con las ganas de desayunar con esas maravillosas vistas. Y el segundo pero es para la zona The Level Lounge, me esperaba algo más de variedad de picoteo,  no solo unos snacks y frutos secos.

Salvo esas dos cosas puntuales en terminos generales muy contento con mi estancia, sin duda volvería a repetir.

Gracias Meliá Barcelona Sky por hacer de mi estancia una experiencia inolvidable.",5,2018,02,12
28,Siempre perfecto,"Es el hotel donde me alojo siempre que puedo y nunca he tenido la mas mínima queja en ningún sentido. Y cuando ha sucedido algún contratiempo siempre han actuado muy profesionalmente y con celeridad. El personal es una maravilla, sin excepción y siempre me han hecho sentir como en casa. Mencionar especialmente a Yolanda, de recepción y a todo el departamento de Guest Experience, que siempre me han tratado genial y a los cuales me alegro de ver cada vez que voy al hotel.",5,2018,02,09
28,Un paraíso,"Estuvimos un fin de semana en Barcelona y elegimos este hotel y nos encantó! Fué una maravilla, sobretodo el personal. La exclusividad de The Level es para vivirla y disfrutarla, su recepcionista yolanda y el departamento de guest experience, con Llorenç al frente, lo más destacable. 
Muy buenas instalaciones y situación en la ciudad es recomendable 100%.",5,2018,02,08
28,Meraviglioso hotel,"Ho soggiornato in una junior suite al 26° piano: ho ricevuto l'upgrade gratuito visto che l'hotel era al completo per degli eventi aziendali. Camera incredibilmente confortevole con una qualità del sonno eccezionale, silenziosa e accogliente. bagno ampio con doppia doccia, vasca e courtesy item.

Doppio schermo sia nella giorno giorno che fronte letto.

Happy hour compreso nel prezzo della camera con buon buffet.

Colazione da migliorare soprattutto nella qualità delle bevande: un 5 stelle non può servire bevande dal distributore automatico.",5,2018,02,04
28,Le sobra el adjetivo The Level,"Claro y conciso:

- Servicio inexistente: más de 3 horas esperando para el check in siendo cliente Melia Rewards Platinum.
- Personal cero proactivo y desinformado: Me iban a asignar una habitación inferior a mi categoría. Me cobraron excesos en facturas que los reclamé y me ponen excusas de unos bonos de 20€ que tenia por noche que no aplican. El recepcionista Bruno fue cero profesional.
- Mala ubicación: Poblenou aun no está bien comunicado con el centro.
- Restaurantes vende humos: mucho renombre pero poca calidad y variedad en la carta
- Malos modales: el día del check out llegan a mi habitación dando porrazos en la puerta porque tenía que irme. (Eran las 11:00 de la mañana, cuando tenía check out a las 16:00 por mi categoría de cliente)

Todo esto fue transmitido a la dirección, y tras días esperando una respuesta, me contestan y me siguen vendiendo humo.

Mi recomendación: No se dejen engañar por su altura y por ser un Meliá, les aseguro que no cumplen la filosofía ni los estándares de la cadena hotelera. Busquen otras opciones, como por ejemplo el Meliá Sarria, mucho más céntrico y con una reputación mejor.",1,2017,12,22
28,DECEPCIONANTE,"Estuve en un Meliá de Sevilla y fue una maravilla así q cogimos éste Meliá de Barcelona pensando q serían iguales por pertenecer a la misma cadena y vaya decepción. 
Llegamos el viernes a las 20 horas y ya no estaban los de chek quin del leve, nos dieron la habitación en la planta 23, cuando entramos la habitación no estaba mal pero no para ser una habitación level como esperábamos. La zona level de picoteo era de risa algunos vinos y cavas, salchichón, queso, nachos de bolsa y alguna tontería más pero vamos era de risa y encima cierran esa zona a las 19 horas de la tarde, un poco pronto para mi gusto y el de otros.  La ducha del baño no tenía presión para salir el agua, salia por el micrófono de la  ducha de mano, cuando intenté q saliera por la q debería se me rompió una uña q me arrancó parte de la carne del dedo,sangre un montón. No había papelera en la habitación sólo un cesto en el baño y pequeñito,lo q quisieras botar iba al piso directamente. Once de la noche un ruido q no se podía dormir q venia de la habitación de arriba,no supimos si eran obras o clientes del hotel. 
Para terminar los taxis son un imposible de coger en esa zona porq está muy apartada del centro y eso q hay una parada de taxis casi enfrente del hotel pero no hay ninguno cuando sales a buscarlos Y mi chico se quiso tomar un gin tonic y la camarera no sabía lo q eran bayas de enebro,  que cosa, y encima le ponen la bebida que pidió con un trocito de peladura de limón y le cobraron 16 pavos 😲😲😲 ya fue la gota q colmó el vaso. El hotel no debería de ser 5 estrellas y prestar ese tipo de servicios tan malos. Para destacar sólo el desayuno está muy bien. Espero q quien dirije este hotel se de cuenta de lo q cobra por un pésimo servicio. ",3,2017,12,16
28,Genial,"estuvimos un fin de semana, y nos encanto el hotel, la recepcion, la habitacion muy bonita  y las vistas espectaculares, por la noche impresionantes la verdad, pero lo mejor fue el personal,elsa se ocupo de todo y nos hizo sentir en casa.volveremos",5,2017,12,14
28,ESPECTACULAR!!!!!!!,"Estuvimos alojados a mediados de este mes en este espectacular hotel. No es la primera vez que nos alojamos en el  (tampoco será la última), pero en cada nueva ocasión que podemos disfrutar de este espectacular hotel y de su inmejorable personal, quedamos sorprendidos por el detalle, la simpatía, la educación..., me faltan adjetivos positivos para calificar la profesionalidad de todo el personal del servicio the level (Evelina, Angélica, José...). Pero quiero agradecer pública y especialmente, ya que no pude hacerlo en persona, a Elsa del servicio Guest experience el trato personal y profesional recibido, fue simplemente espectacular.
 Si quieren sentirse como en casa en Barcelona, sin duda este es vuestro hotel.",5,2017,12,11
28,Muy bien,"Un hotel bastante cómodo! Muy limpio y organizado! El personal súper amable, la cama perfecta! El desayuno muy completo en un restaurante con unas vistas de la ciudad impresionante! Sin dudas vale la pena",5,2017,10,30
28,Excellente,"Volví a hacer noche en The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky después de 2 años para descansar durante mi viaje. Si ya tenía una muy buena impresión del hotel, ahora es espectacular con la reforma.
Conociendo el hotel, al llegar, fui directamente desde el parking a la planta 25 The Level, para hacer el check in de mi Junior Suite Executive.
Me encontré con el salón reformado y ha quedado precioso. Como siempre, reciben a los clientes con copa de cava mientras realizan el check in y dándote todas las informaciones del hotel.
Al llegar a la habitación me quede con la boca abierta. Si antes era amplia y bonita, con la reforma parece más amplia aun. Una decoración que desprende paz y descanso.
El baño dispone de bañera así como ducha doble.
Para tomar aperitivos tenemos a disposición el lounge de la planta 25 y un espacio reservado en la planta baja.
Pero lo mejor fui a la mañana siguiente. El desayuno lo sirven en la terraza de la planta 24 con vistas al mar. El buffet está montado en la cocina del restaurante y es muy original. Productos de calidad.
No hay que olvidar el buen trabajo de las chicas de limpieza ya que estaba todo impoluto en la habitación.
Gracias a todo el personal del hotel por su amabilidad, por mimarte y hacerte sentir como en casa, además de ser grandes profesionales.",5,2017,10,26
28,Lujo y calidad en Barcelona!,"Sin duda, una de las mejores opciones en Barcelona! Las instalaciones del hotel son impresionantes, las habitaciones muy modernas y el personal muy atento y amable! Las vistas desde todas las instalaciones del hotel son impresionantes, puedes ver todos los rincones de Barcelona desde varios puntos del hotel. El The Level Lounge, situado en la planta 25, te invita a relajarte mientras tomas un aperitivo y disfrutas de las vistas. Siendo cliente The Level, te permite acceder a un open bar que se celebra en el restaurante Merkado por la tarde, la calidad es buenísima! La habitación era super bonita y muy moderna, no faltaba ni un solo detalle!",5,2017,09,26
28,experiencia de lujo,"El hotel se encuentra en una zona alejada del centro pero bien comunicada y es fácil aparcar si vas en coche.
Las instalaciones son modernas, las habitaciones del level no son muy grandes pero modernas, la cama muy cómoda , las amenities del baño, toallas, zapatillas, todo perfecto.
Las vistas son espectaculares y lo mejor es el desayuno , completísimo, de calidad y con vistas al mar .
La piscina está en una terraza agradable con hamacas .
El gimnasio y el spa los encontré muy pequeños, aunque estando alojados en el level, la entrada es gratuita.
La única pega es que las dos veces que nos hemos alojado , los tramites de check-in en la planta level han sido excesivamente lentos.
Por lo demás, todo estupendo, para repetir.",5,2017,09,13
28,Vista stupenda di Barcellona,"Siamo stati veramente coccolati in questo albergo. Ci hanno trattato benissimo in tutte le nostre richieste, la camera e le altre strutture sono veramente bellissime e nuove. Nota particolare per la colazione a buffet con qualsiasi leccornia. Molto consigliato!!",5,2017,09,12
28,Meine Erwartungen an ein Hotel dieser Kategorie wurden enttäuscht,"Enttäuschung in Barcelona und noch nie zuvor erlebt. Noch dazu hatte ich sogar The Level Zimmer gebucht. Das Hotel war einfach zu finden aber als ich abends ankam und wie immer vor dem Öffnen meines Koffers das Zimmer ansehe und Fotos mache, bin ich erschrocken wie nie zuvor (nicht mals in 3 oder  4* Hotels. Auf dem frisch bezogenen Bett befand sich ein grosser unübersehbare gelbbrauner Flecke auf einen der Kopfkissen, als ich die Tür zur Dusche öffnete war die Ablage voller leerer, halbleeren und ungeöffneter Shampoo Flaschen des Hotels. In einer der obersten Schrankablageflächen noch eine schwarze Kappe und unter dem Doppelwaschbeckentisch am Boden ein Perlenohrring  (dieser lag sogar nach dem Frühstück am nächsten Tag, nachdem die Putzfrau schon dort war noch immer an derselben Stelle)! Ich hatte ihn nur zufällig entdeckt, da ich mein langes Haar immer kopfüber  über der Badewanne bürste und dabei den Ohrring sah. Ich habe natürlich nach dem Frühstück reklamiert und auch Fotos gezeigt. Das Personal war ebenso schockiert und gab mir ein anderes viel grösseres Zimmer und lies diverse Kleinigkeiten vom Roomservice bringen um sich nochmals zu entschuldigen. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption  und die Guest Experience Managerin Frau Elsa Escrig Pérez sich mehrmals für den Vorfall entschuldigten und mir 25 % des Zimmergrundpreises zurückerstattet. Schade, denn die Angestellten waren alle sehr zuvorkommend und nett. Auch in der Level Lounge(habe leider keinen Namen ausser vom Roomservice), in der Bar im Erdgeschoss und die Zimmerdame, die abends das Bett aufschlug.  Ein Name der mir in besonders positiver Erinnerung blieb, Ivan Calideron aus Lateinamerika, der mehrmals die „Wiedergutmachungen“ ins  Zimmer brachte. Bei ihm hatte man sogar noch das Gefühl, d.  er seinen Job gerne macht und die Freundlichkeit von innen kam. Das Frühstücksbuffet war gut und meinem Wunsch auf starken Kaffee wurde nachgegangen. Ich war schon oft und in vielen Hotels der Melia-Hotelkette aber dieser Aufenthalt vor dem nahenden Platiniumstatus-Ende trübte meine „Meliatreue“ ziemlich.",3,2017,09,12
28,Non soddisfatto ,"Ho alloggiato con la mia famiglia per due notti, la mia camera si trovava al 23 piano sopra di noi al 24 c'è il ristorante quindi rumore fino a tarda notte sia per il ristorante e sia per gli ascensori, stanza poco insonorizzata, tenda oscurante dentro la stanza di pessima esecuzione, quindi ho dormito malissimo. Colazione buona per il resto non è da 5 stelle.",3,2017,08,27
28,Recomendado!!!!,"Es una gran elección si estás de visita por la ciudad de Barcelona. 
Las habitaciones no son muy grandes pero lo suficiente. Moderno, muy bien decorado y limpio. Teníamos habitación con vistas al mar y es precioso. 
El spa no es muy grande pero tiene lo necesario y para pasar un rato está muy bien. En la terraza de la piscina ponen música, hay un restaurante donde puedes comer (y esta buenísimo) y es está muy chulo!!
En general el hotel me encantó, los restaurantes y el desayuno son muy buenos y el trato del personal es maravilloso. Si vuelvo a Barcelona escogeré el mismo, Melia nunca defrauda.",5,2017,08,22
28,"Un hotel genial, moderno y con vistas",Nos alojamos con mi novio dos veces aqui y nos encanta. El hotel y sus serivicos lo mejor. Las habitaciones hermosas y con vistas divinas al mar. El desayuno es variado y con vistas de casi toda la costa de barcelona. Volveremos seguro,5,2017,07,18
28,LEVEL 100%,"Desde la entrada al hotel todo es servicio y calidad. Reservamos una junior suite, para lo cual el check in se encuentra en la planta 25, donde Paramjot nos atendió con absoluta amabilidad y educación, atendiendo todas nuestras preguntas.
Nos realizaron un upgrade a Executive Suite, con la cual quedamos más que encantados: diseño, comodidad, amenities, etc. La piscina de la sexta planta resultó de lo más relajante.
El desayuno excelente, con cocina en vivo incluida.
En definitiva, es una estancia de coste elevado, pero merece la pena",5,2017,06,14
28,Ocio,"Mi estancia este fin de semana en el hotel the level At Meliá Barcelona soy hay sido muy buena. 
Ubicación. Un poco alejada del centro de Barcelona pero maravillosa si quiere descansar 
Habitación. Me alojé en una habitación premiun de la planta 20 muy espaciosa con cuarto de baño grande y algo de agradecer para personas que como yo tienen problemas de sueño, las cortinas cerraban del todo sin dejar traspasar luz. Como pega diré que le faltaba sitio donde secar el bikini cuando vuelves.
Piscina. Pequeña pero muy confortable aunque yo pondría más sombrillas porque las camas balinesas siempre se llenan.
Spa. Muy pequeño pero los tratamientos muy completos.
Restauración. Desayuno incluido muy satisfactorio en la planta 24 única pega no poder reservar en el restaurante dos cielos deberían dejar mesas para los clientes del hotel.
En general la experiencia agradable y lo que esperaba en la cadena Meliá
Personal excelente desde el primero hasta el último ",4,2017,06,11
28,Hotel inmejorable,"Hotel excelente como todas mis experiencias Melia. Me alojé en una habitación The Level planta 20, vista al mar, impresionante (dimensiones, cama, almohadas, baño con ducha y bañera, amenitis, cafetera, etc) sin olvidar la limpieza y hacían al menos la habitación dos veces al día. ( un aplauso a las camareras de habitación)
Los desayunos en la planta 24 en la terraza inmejorables, AMABILIDAD, TRATO Y SERVICIO de todo el personal, quiero hacer una mención especial a la cocinera (tortillas, huevos fritos y en especial los huevos Benedictine (sin palabras).
No me quiero olvidar de el empleado que me atendió al llegar al hotel, (no me quedé con su nombre(sólo se que es del Español) su atención al acompañarme en mí coche hasta llegar al hotel, no tengo palabras.
Y como colofón la cena en en el Restaurante Dos Cielos en la planta 24 de los Hermanos Torres (No estaban, parece ser que muelen estar), pero el menú degustación impresionante.
En general una experiencia inolvidable.
Algo que objetar ( el spa y la variedad en el The Level planta 25)",5,2017,06,07
28,Leider eine große Enttäuschung,"Wir hatten eine Juniorsuite im Level gebucht, die 426.-€ / Nacht berechnet wird. Als Goldcardinhaber der Meliagruppe, also Kunden, die sehr oft kommen, hatten wir schon etwas erwartet. Die erste Enttäuschung war schon beim Check- in, als man uns sofort eine bessere Suite für 100.-€ mehr anbot. Wir waren erstmal sprachlos, denn wir dachten mehr als 400.-€ müßte schon was sein.Also lehneten wir ab und bekamen unsere bestellte Suite, gelinde gesagt eine Rumpelkammer ohne Aussicht, kleines Badezimmer.Ein Desaster!! Wir wieder zurück zur Rezeption und wollten eine andere Suite,wie geagt nur die mit Aufpreis wäre frei. Erst ein Gespräch mit dem Manager ermöglichte eine vernünftige Lösung.Wir bekamen eine ordentliche Suite ohne Aufpreis. Der Service im Hotel ist hervorragend.Leider ist das Angebot im Level mehr als enttäuschend: Wir haben 7 Tage gebucht und seit dieser Zeit gibt es als Tapas die selben Teigrollen mit Tomatenmarkt gefüllt.Das wars!!!Das Angebot an Spirituosen ist mehr als basic,es gibt einfache, unbekannte Mixgetränke, keine namhaften Spirituosen und reichlich Chips und Erdnüsse.Von all den Level Melias, die wir kennen, ist dies hier der wirklich ""low cost spezial"".Schön hervorzuheben ist der Frühstücksraum, der ist gepflegt, das Frühstück bietet alles, was man möchte und der Service ist einfach Spitze.Das Restaurant, das abends auch für die Levelgäste geöffnet ist, hat Kantinenstyle und bietet für Levelgäste geschmierte Brote und ähnliches an, also zum vergessen.Fazit ein an sich tolles, engagiertes Personal, aber ein Managemant, das mit dem Rotstift die Gäste verkrault.",2,2017,05,28
28,100 de 100,"Excelente vacaciones, fue mi primera visita al hotel y la he pasado muy bien, la fiesta del club vacacional circle fue muy buena, el personal, la comida, la gente , las instalaciones todo es super otro nivel ",5,2017,05,11
28,Ein schöner Aufenthalt,"Wir sind letztendlich mit unserem Aufenthalt im Melia Sky The Level zufrieden, auch wenn wir vom Zimmer bei der Anzahl an Sternen mehr erwartet hätten. Es war recht eng, es gab keinen Stauraum für Kleidung, es fehlte der Flaschenöffner u.ä. Dafür würden wir definitiv keine 4-5 Sterne vergeben. Das Frühstück bot für Gäste mit spezifischen Ernährungsbedürfnissen (z.B. laktosefrei) nur eine extrem eingeschränkte Auswahl (obwohl vorher von Seiten des Hotels eine ""große Auswahl"" versprochen wurde). 
Das im Erdgeschoss von 19 bis 22 Uhr für Level-Gäste angebotene kostenfreie Snacks und Drinks Buffet wurde von uns gerne angenommen. Und hier können wir auch von ganzem Herzen 5 Sterne vergeben. Das Personal in diesem Bereich war überdurchschnittlich freundlich und zuvorkommend. Besonders möchten wir uns bei Gador, Ana und David bedanken.
Also alles in allem, wir würden trotz der Beanstandungen bzgl. Zimmer und Frühstück jederzeit wieder in diesem Hotel übernachten.",4,2017,05,11
28,Ausgezeichnet,"Wir waren Ende März für ein verlängertes Wochenende in Barcelona und haben unseren Aufenthalt im The Level at Melia sehr genossen.
Am Eingang des Hotels hatte man uns nach unserem Namen gefragt und wir wruden darauf hingewiesen, dass wir in einer der oberen Etagen einen privaten Check In hätten. Dies haben wir natürlich sehr gerne genutzt. Der Empfang war freundlich und wir bekamen alle Infos die wir zu Barcelona wissen mussten. Nicht zu viel, aber ausreichend. Ebenso gab es beim Check in ein kostenfreies Glässchen Champagner oder andere Getränke zur Auswahl. 
Wir hatten auch Zugang zur Lounge, direkt neben der Rezeption mit traumhaften Ausblick über die Stadt. Hier gab es nachmittags Kaffee & Kuchen umsonst (wenn dies in der Zimmerrate inkludiert ist) und abends kleine Snacks sowie Wein und Bier etc. umsonst. Auf der untersten Etage des Hotels konnte man an der bar ebenso kostenfrei (wenn in der Rate inklusive) Snacks zu sich nehmen und die Seele baumeln lassen. 
Das Zimmer (Junior Suite) war 1A!!! Der Ausblick war der Hammer (Blick über die Stadt) mit bodenlangen Fenstern. Für 2 Personen riesig!!! Selbst die Dusche war für 2 Personen ausgestattet, es gab 2 Regenduschen in einer :) Ein Traum.
Sollten wir wiedermal in Barcelona sein wird dieses hotel auf jeden Fall wieder gebucht!",5,2017,05,10
28,Espectacular el hotel y el personal,"Estuvimos un grupo de amigos durante una noche. La ubicación tranquila y no lejos de los puntos de interés.
El personal 10/10, de verdad que espectacular.
Instalaciones: Sobrados para un 4*
La piscina es pequeña pero suficiente para darte un chapuzón y el servicio tb ahí buenísimo.
En la zona Level el servicio, ammenities, comida y bebida súper bien.",5,2017,05,08
28,Genial ,"Trato muy amable, incluso me pusieron en una suite. Las vistas increíbles. Muy agradable todo. El hotel está ubicado en buen lugar, también guardan las maletas por si quieres aprovechar el dia que te toque abandonar la habitación.",5,2017,05,06
28,UNA EXPERIENCIA SEIS ESTRELLAS,"Me he alojado tres noches. A destacar la calidad y atención del servicio que, sin ser invasor, están pendientes de todos los detalles. Muy bien el check-in en la planta 25. Especialmente agradable los desayunos con vistas al mar en la planta 24. Ha sido fantástico. En diversos momentos el equipo de LEVEL se ha puesto en contacto con nosotros para recibirnos y ofrecerse, dejando también algunos detalles y sorpresas que han hecho la estancia muy especial. MUCHAS GRACIAS!",5,2017,05,04
28,"Bien, pero....","Nos hemos alojado en The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky, es muy cómoda la recepción preferente en la planta 25. Están muy bien los servicios extra que te ofrece the level. Yolanda, la recepcionista, es francamente operativa. La habitación 2102 tiene un buen tamaño, camas cómodas, el baño perfecto, solo tiene un pero, la mampara pierde agua. El desayuno, de la planta 24, es estupendo, falta un poco de variedad y un poco más de rapidez en el servicio. Son un poco lentos y personalmente eso no me gusta. La última noche no pasaron a realizar la habitación por la tarde.(esto no se puede tolerar en un servicio 5*). El hotel en general está bien, pero le falta un pelín para las 5*. Otra cosa negativa que tiene el hotel es que está ligeramente alejado. Con lo que se pierde algo de tiempo en la visita de la ciudad.

Estancia del 28/04/17-01/05/17

",4,2017,05,01
28,Una gran experiencia!,"Un hotel muy bonito y confortable con unas muy buenas vistas de toda la ciudad, la habitación está equipada con todo, con un gran televisor y una cama en la que cabríanuna familia entera (enorme), el SPA genial también y por parte de los trabajadores y personal del hotel un 10 en amabilidad y atención.

Volvería repetir sin duda alguna.",5,2017,04,29
28,SENCILLAMENTE MARAVILLOSO ,El haber encontrado este hotel ha sido una de las mejores cosas que me ha pasado a nivel de viajes. Cómodo como el que más. Una profesionalidad y una calidad excelentes. El personal de GUEST EXPERIENCE sencillamente maravilloso. Están pendientes del cliente en todo momento. El desayuno digno de reyes. Ha sido muy agradable el trato con los empleados. Si vuelvo a BARCELONA sin ninguna duda volveré a este hotel. Un 10 !!!,5,2017,04,26
28,Livello superiore,"Albergo di livello eccelso.
Accoglienza al 25° piano e vista dalla camera veramente superba.
Camere spaziose e bel bagno.
La colazione al piano 24 è veramente superba.
Palestra un pò piccolina per quanto è grande l'albergo.
Super Top nella nuova Barcellona lungo la Diagonal.
Vicinissimo alla metropolitana di Poble Nou.",5,2017,04,22
28,EXCELENTE!!!!!,"Hotel muy bien ubicado, personal muy atento y servicial, excelente en diseño e instalaciones. Totalmente recomendable, especialmente el servicio Level.
Bar-terraza en planta 24 con vistas mar muy agradable. Estupendo desayuno, muy completo.",5,2017,04,05
28,Espectacular de principio a fin,"Una experiencia dificil de olvidar. En la recepción de la planta 25 ya te sientes como un VIP cuando te ofrecen una copa de cava mientras haces el checkin.

En el bar de la planta 24 los detalles se cuidan a máximo. El trato de todo el personal es exquisito, amable y atentos en todo momento.

Las habitaciones perfectas, con todas las comodidades, limpias, silenciosas y siempre con vistas espectaculares a toda la ciudad, ya sea hacia la montaña del Tibidavo o hacia la costa.

Y qué decir del desayuno? un buffet más que completo, con todo tipo de opciones frias y calientes, platos elaborados en showcooking en directo y frutas de todo tipo.

En definitiva, un auténtico lujo para los sentidos ;-)",5,2017,04,03
28,Sehr schön mit kleinen Mängeln,"Sehr Schönes Hotel , Frühstück sehr lecker !
Leider Schimmel im Zimmer aber konnten schnell ein anderes bekommen . Service nett und zuvorkommend . Strand in ca 200m weg und direkte Anbindung zur Straßenbahn ",4,2017,03,31
28,Ein Traum über den Dächern der Stadt...,"Wir wurden am Anreisetag sehr freundlich an der Rezeption empfangen.
Frau Mireia Alegre empfing uns sogar auf Deutsch. Sie zeigte uns unser gebuchtes Zimmer und als Upgradevorschlag eines im 20. Stock.
Es war sehr schön, dass sich jemand die Zeit nahm, uns alles zu zeigen!
Bei dem atemberaubenden Ausblick vom Zimmer im 20. Stock konnten wir nicht nein sagen und buchten ein Upgrade.
Hinzu kamen die Vorteile des Upgrades ( Vom ""normalen Melia zum ""The Level"" ): Frühstück im 24. Stock ( mit Meerblick ), freier Zugang zum Spa und das Nutzen der Lounge im 25. Stock.
Dort konnte man den Tag über, aber insbesonde den Abend bei einem Glas Wein oder Cava ausklingen lassen, natürlich mit Blick über die Stadt.

Wir haben uns absolut top betreut gefühlt.
Auch unsere Sonderwünsche wurden perfekt bearbeitet & erfüllt.

Wobei sich Frau Alegre sogar in ihrer Freizeit ( freie Tage ) um alles gekümmert hatte... So klappte es auch mit dem Heiratsantrag :)

Was auch zu erwähnen bleibt:
Der Service und die Qualität vom Frühstück waren sehr gut.
Die Sauberkeit der Zimmer und des Hotels fanden wir tadellos.
Auch mangelte es nicht an kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten. So wurde uns am einzigen Regentag unseres Aufenthaltes ein Regenschirm an der Rezeption gereicht.
Der technische Standart der Zimmer ist absolut zeitgemäß.
Dazu kamen noch tolle Insidertips von Frau Alegre...

Alles in allem ein unvergesslicher Urlaub.",5,2017,03,31
28,¡Inmejorable!,"Perfecta atención, servicio siempre atento a tus necesidades y mucha profesionalidad. La comida es excelente y la habitación también. Desde dentro de la habitación no se oye nada, por lo que la tranquilidad es absoluta.",5,2017,03,24
28,Falla la situación,"Lo único negativo que puedo decir de este hotel es su situación !!!
Lo cierto es que el hotel está muy bien. La recepción en The Level es de la manera habitual y como se espera de un cinco estrellas. Me llama la atención que no tenga servicio de maleteros, tratándose de un hotel de esta categoría.
La,habitación está realmente bien, gran tamaño, amenities de Loewe, televisión gigante. A esto se le añade las vistas al mar desde una planta alta, una pasada.
Me ha sorprendido y muy gratamente el desayuno, por la variedad y las vistas. 
El trato por parte de todos los empleados es excelente.
La pena, en mi opinión, es que lo único criticable no tiene solución, su situación (nunca había cogido tantos taxis).
Si las distancias no son un problema en la visita a la ciudad, el,hotel es muy recomendable.",4,2017,03,23
28,Wirklich empfehlenswert ,"Tolles Haus mit tollen Zimmern, tollem Blick und tollem Personal. Den The Level Gästen steht die Longe im 25 Stock von 7-23h zur Verfügung (Snacks, Getränke, Buchung von Ausflügen,...). Gefrühstückt wird auf der Terrasse im 24 Stock. Sehr nette Restaurantleiterin, sehr aufmerksam, toller Blick und bis 11h tolles Frühstück. Von 19-22h gibts Snacks um Freigetränke im Restaurant. Das Hotel liegt verkehrsgünstig. Ich würde wieder machen.",4,2017,03,21
28,Muy recomendable,"Nuestra experiencia de fin de semana el el Barcelona Sky ha sido excelente.
Si bien no está céntrico, el hotel es ideal y está situado en una zona muy tranquila,  aunque con todos los servicios y además está muy bien comunicado. 
Desde el momento en que entramos al hotel estuvimos muy bien atendidos. 
El trato recibido por el personal de The Level fue muy profesional y siempre con una sonrisa. Destacar especialmente la atención dispensada por Marc en el momento del check-in y la del Sr. Cloquell del departamento de Guest Experience que se preocupó en todo momento de que nuestra estancia fuera lo más agradable posible.
Da gusto coincidir con personal tan diligente!
Todo muy recomendable.",5,2017,03,21
28,Muy buen hotel algo apartado,"Es la segunda vez que nos hospedamos en este hotel y es tal y como lo recordábamos, moderno, alto, repleto de servicios y atenciones, con buenas vistas y buena comida. La recepción The Level está en la planta 25, las habitaciones con ese servicio están próximas a esa planta, y hasta la 28. Te reciben, como en todos los Meliá The Level con champán y canapés, que se agradece nada más llegar del aeropuerto con maletas.

Han mejorado el desayuno, pues han habilitado en el servicio The Level el restaurante 2 Cielos y el bufet es de primerísima calidad, todo muy cuidado, tanto de sabor como estético. La única pega es que se echan de menos unas patatas panaderas con cebolla, ajo y pimiento asadas al horno, aunque puede ser que lo añadan próximamente.

Han añadido, además, una segunda zona The Level en la planta baja, con canapés (poco variados y escasos, eso sí), bebidas alcohólicas (con marcas del montón, aquí deberían mejorar muchísimo para alcanzar el nivel de otros 5 estrellas The Level) y refrescos (sin ninguna pega).

Dispone de un SPA pequeño pero muy acogedor y moderno, el jacuzzi es muy funcional y cómodo. Una sauna, un baño turco y varias duchas efecto lluvia completan la zona de aguas. Un relax obligado si dedicas el día a pasear por toda Barcelona.

Dispone de parking, aunque no es del hotel, en esta ocasión no lo utilizamos, en la anterior sí y recuerdo que nos hicieron 2 euros de descuento diarios por estar alojados en el hotel.

Sólo tiene la línea amarilla cerca, la parada de Poblenou está a menos de 5 minutos caminando. Sin embargo, pese a que esta línea nos lleva directamente a la parada de Paseo de Gracia, muy cerca de Plaza Cataluña, es muy incómoda para ir en metro a ningún sitio, es necesario hacer hasta tres transbordos.

Una pega sería, además de la ausencia de variedad (que no calidad) de los canapés, y de las pobres marcas de bebidas alochólicas, la ausencia de canales en español, pues apenas teníamos disponibles 8 canales, cuando, como mínimo, deberían tener la parrilla de la TDT y varios canales de Canal+.

Sin embargo, En generalel hotel,es de primera categoría, los empleados, de distintas nacionalidades, nos atendieron fenomenal, todos muy amables y encantadores. Tuvimos un pequeño inconveniente en el check-out que resolvieron rápido y muy satisfactoriamente. Muy recomendable.",4,2017,03,13
28,Gran experiencia,"Este fin de semana estuvimos con mi pareja alojados en este hotel. Desde el primer momento hasta el ultimo nos atendieron estupendamente, especialmente miguel de recepcion.el desayuno completisimo y un buen spa para relajarse despues de un dia de visitas.la proxima visita sin duda nos alojaremos en este hotel.",5,2017,03,05
28,Muy buena Opcion!,"Hotel muy agradable, con muy buen ambiente, no es céntrico, pero tiene una situación muy buena.
Las habitaciones de las últimas plantas son espectaculares, nos hicieron upgrade a una suite, sin comentarios....
Gimnasio bien y spa mas que aceptable.
El servicio The Level, muy bueno.",5,2017,02,25
28,Personal poco amable,"El pasado mes de enero solicité cotización para realizar un evento con reserva de 30 habitaciones, salón de actos, etc. 

Tras muchas llamadas y después de dos semanas sin recibir noticias, me llegó un e-mail de la Srta. Herrero (Mice Sales Executive)  diciéndome que no me habían contestado porque no tenían disponibilidad para esas fechas que solicité. 

Como no me lo creí, volví a llamar haciéndome pasar por otro cliente interesado en mismos días de evento y sí había disponibilidad. 

En fin, con esta actitud la Srta. Herrero en lugar de pedir disculpas por no haber contestado los 4 correos que se le enviaron en tiempo y forma decidió INVENTARSE la falta de disponibilidad. 

El año pasado ya había estado y me pareció un hotel bastante bueno pero con todo lo ocurrido este año NO VOLVERÉ A PISAR DICHO HOTEL. (A pesar de que soy cliente Platinum de la cadena Meliá)",1,2017,02,20
28,Cinquantesimo di compleanno ,"Tutto molto bello, letto comodo, stanza spaziosa, doccia spaziosa, pulito, personale gentile e carina la SPA, ma..... un odore costante, poco piacevole..... il termoarredo che nonostante il richiamo nn ha mai funzionato. ",1,2017,02,19
28,Un hotel increíble.,"En este hotel de Melià uno se siente como en casa. Te reciben con una sonrisa y con una elegancia en el servicio que se ve en pocos lugares. Saben ser cercanos y profesionales al mismo tiempo y se avanzan a tus caprichos. Como detalle pedí miel en el desayuno y después me la tenían preparada cada día. Mi pareja me hizo ver lo bien colocado que está todo en la habitación y efectivamente esta todo milimétricamente dispuesto, ordenado y limpio. A la llegada nos esperaba unos bombones de chocolate y agua, algo muy de agradecer. Disfrutamos de unas vistas que quitan el hipo, en un edificio de diseño muy bonito. Dar las gracias a Llorenç por sus recomendaciones sobre que visitar en Barcelona, sus sugerencias fueron muy acertadas.",5,2017,02,06
28,Sin palabras,"Fuimos de fin de semana romántica con mi pareja y nunca olvidaremos lo bien que nos trataron. Me puse en contacto por email con Jorge de Guest Experience para que nos prepararan algo especial y nos regalaron una botella de cava y pétalos por toda la habitación, además nos trajeron fresas!. no me extraña que Melià sea una buena cadena porque te hacen sentir muy bien. Mi pareja y yo estuvimos encantados. Ya pensamos en volver porque no hacía muy buen tiempo, pero sí que disfrutamos más del hotel, acabado de reformar y está todo nuevo. El desayuno en la planta 24 es algo que nadie debe perderse. Es como estar en una película de lujo. La atención al cliente es exquisita como en la mayoría de hoteles de la cadena que he visitado.
Gracias a todo el equipo.",5,2017,02,06
28,Trato chulesco,"Hola, después de llevar desde las 7 de la tarde en el aeropuerto de Barcelona, con continuos cambios de puerta, 1 hora y media métidos en el avión, por fin despegamos rumbo a La Coruña, 1 hora después el comandante dice que hay que volver a Barcelona por las malas condiciones metereologicas, en fin, después de muchas colas para que te den otro vuelo, hotel, cena etc... llegamos al Melia Sky, unas 100 personas a las 4 de la madrugada esperando coger una habitación y 2 recepcionistas cumpliendo impecablemente su trabajo, DNI, tarjeta de crédito, a no que había un tercer recepcionista llamado Jorge creo o Jordi bueno no se la verdad, este no asignaba nada solo miraba el ordenador eso sí después de decirme que teníamos suerte que eran 3, señores del Melia, no será más fácil coger los DNI, hacer la ficha mientras el huésped descansa ?, el siguiente vuelo es a las 8:20 eso quiere decir que a las 6:45 hay que salir para el aeropuerto !
Señor director del Melia, hay veces que el protocolo está para saltárselo y dar más importancia al descanso aunque solo sea de un par de horas, aaa y gracias por la suerte que hemos tenido de tener 3 recepcionistas, bueno 2 por qué el Sr que la verdad no sé si era jorge o Jordi, da lo mismo para el caso, pues sólo veía el ordenador. Recuerden 100 personas por lo menos que creo que se merecían un pequeño descanso !!!",1,2017,02,03
28,Experiencia inolvidable,"La cálida acogida y  la exquisita atención que hemos recibido por parte de todos han convertido nuestra estancia en el hotel en una experiencia inolvidable. Gracias, Jorge, Thomas, Miquel, haced extensivo nuestro agradecimiento a todos vuestros compañeros",5,2017,01,30
28,Super Aufenthalt,Sehr tolles und modernes Hotel. Guter Service mit einer sehr tollen Einrichtung. Einzig de Lage könnte man als negativ betrachten wenn man eher zentral sein möchte. Das Hotel ist etwas außerhalb und nicht direkt im Zentrum.,4,2017,01,20
28,The Level reformado aún mejor,"Escondido en las últimas plantas del Sky Melià encontramos The Level, un 5 estrellas que ha mejorado sus instalaciones fruto de una reforma impecable. Recepción privada en un lobby donde tomar algo, descansar o trabajar; habitaciones sensacionales (mejor con vistas al mar que a la ciudad) y un trato excepcional de TODAS y TODOS los trabajadores del hotel, hacen que tu estancia sea especial. Vale la pena visitar el spa (incluido con la habitación), aunque hay que decir que le falta un poco de mantenimiento por fallar alguna parte de él y si se opta por un masaje, será una buena opción. Muy buen wifi en todo el hotel, indispensable para el trabajo u ocio. También hay que destacar el reservado en la planta baja, donde se puede picar de 19 a 22 h. algún aperitivo dulce y salado, también incluido con la habitación. Y la gran novedad (felicidades a quien pensó en cómo utilizar este espacio por las mañanas) es el desayuno en la terraza del restaurante Dos Torres en la planta 24. Una vez más excelente servicio, comida de gran calidad y una vistas impresionantes. En definitiva, una vez más, GRACIAS por hacer de nuestra estancia algo inolvidable.",5,2016,12,25
28,"Buen hotel, sin mucho más.","El hotel está bien, como se espera de un Melia, pero para haber sido un ME y estar alojado como LEVEL, me esperaba algo más. Me aloje en la ultima planta, vistas espectaculares a la ciudad, planta 29, pero la habitación algo pequeña sin mesa de despacho, sin bañera. Con cafetera de cápsulas gratuito pero el minibar intocable, una botella de agua seis euros.
Existe una zona de desayuno en la planta 24 para los de LEVEL, para mi, calidad buena pero justito de variedad y también un poco agobiante, esta justo en la cocina del restaurante de los hermanos chefs que salen en la tele.
El personal en general bastante amable y pendiente. La limpieza en general muy bien. Cene un día en el restaurante de la primera planta, calidad buena, precio algo alto, servicio muy lento pero personal atento y amable.
Por ultimo decir el robo del parking, 30€ por noche.
La situación del hotel es buena, cerca de la playa y algo lejos del centro, pero hay mucho transporte para poder llegar sin problemas.",3,2016,12,22
28,Genial,"Nos hemos alojado en una habitación The Level con vistas ciudad. 
Habitación espaciosa, funcional, cómoda; baño también. Todo impecable y limpieza más que perfecta. 
Atención del personal de The Level más que exquisita y desde aquí quiero darles las gracias por todas las atenciones que tuvieron con nosotros.
Desayuno genial y ""entre fogones"", me gustó!
El único ""pero"" es que fuimos al Spa y sólo funcionaba el jacuzzi, el resto no.
Repetiria sin lugar a dudas.",5,2016,12,20
28,Semplicemente magnifico,"Abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti in questo hotel, camere al 22°piano, con upgrade gratuito e vista spettacolare. =) 
Servizio impeccabile, mangiare molto buono (colazione con una vista magnifica), lo staff era veramente molto gentile, sempre sorridente e molto premuroso. 
Sicuramente torneremmo d'estate per usufruire della piscina esterna. 
Ci siamo trovate veramente benissimo.
Ottima esperienza. Complimenti allo Staff.",5,2016,12,15
28,Naja Service... Zimmer Top,"Alles in allem war es gut jedoch mit kleinen Makel zum Beispiel ein Feueralarm ohne Grund ohne zu informieren danah was los war, geschlossene Ausgangstüren, Notausgang jedoch immer offen... 
putzfrauen immer ins Zimmer gekommen TROTZ please do not disturb schild...
Ansonsten Aussicht Top
Frühstück okey
Leider etwas weit weg von innenstadt 
Haben wenigstens noch einen Deutschen Rapper getroffen.
Pool und Poolbar war guut!!

28,Increíble estancia,"Ha sido una estancia perfecta. El trato de todo sus trabajadores ha sido magnífico. Para darles la enhorabuena por su atención y amabilidad. La habitación es excelente, amplia con una gran calidad y detalles. Ya estoy deseando volver a disfrutar de la experiencia The Level.",5,2016,12,04
28,SPETTACOLARE ,"Ottimo hotel. Servizio attento. Personale sempre disponibile, sorridente e gentile. Ottima colazione, molto ricca in tutto. Camera grande, molto confortevole e con vista spettacolare. Il ""the level"" ovviamente ha costo sopra la media ma per chi vuole certi servizi e attenzioni non rimarrà deluso. ",5,2016,12,01
28,Aniversario inolvidable ❤️️,"Han sido dos días inmejorables... la habitación suite Junior de ensueño... el desayuno de película, como si estuvieras en el cielo, el level genial y el trato de todo el personal de 12!! 
Recomendable 200% , no os perdáis la experiencia level !",5,2016,11,27
28,Increíble aniversario...,"Bonito,tranquilo,un servicio inmejorable con unas vistas espectaculares muy recomendable...bien situado, con un servicio de level impresionante,todas las habitaciones son muy bonitas y la suite Junior que es la que reserve algo de ensueño",5,2016,11,27
28,"Exclusivo, buen trato y el precio razonable","En The Level intentan darte un trato exclusivo nada más pasas por la puerta tanto con la atención del personal como con los servicios que ofrecen y la verdad es que lo cosiguen. Además de las múltiples opciones que tienes: acceso al SPA, zona reservada en la cafeteria con snacks, zona de descanso donde te puedes hacer té o café con snacks, etc., la habitación y todas las opciones están muy bien cuidadas para que sean cómodas y de calidad. También probé la comida del bar Merkado y estaba bastante bien y el precio era razonable en relación calidad/precio. Las habitaciones muy limpias, tranquilas para poder dormir y la cáma muy cómoda. Sin duda es una buena opción para viajar a Barcelona si no te importa que esté un poco lejos de todo ya que no está en el centro ni tiene metro al lado, tiene el tranvía que te conecta con la ciudad, en mi caso como me desplazo en taxi o coche no es problema.",5,2016,11,18
28,Decepcionante,"Un autentico desatre. El servicio en el desayuno y en la Cafeteria en general sería impresentable si estuvieramos hablando de un chiringuito de playa, como es un Hotel de 5 estrellas no encuentro el calificativo adecuado. Cualquier consumición en el Hotel se convierte en una perdida de tiempo y en una espera interminable para que te atiendan. No es un problema de falta de personal, ni de voluntad de los empleados. Es claramente un problema de formación y organización de los recursos existentes. Incluso algunos de los camareros tiene dificultades para entnder el castellano, en cambio parece que hablan muy bien ingles.
El Servicio de Habitaciones tampoco funciona, tardaron 2 dias en recoger las tazas sucias a pesar de haberlo pedido en Recepción.
En determinadas zonas del Hotel, entre ellas su Terraza VIP, el olor a  alcantarilla es insoportable...
Si a esto le sumamos que esta bastante alejado del Centro, aunque bien comunicado, el estilo arquitectonico, tipo futurista, está demodé y es dificil de limpiar y que no consiguen realmente diferenciar la parte de 4 estrellas de la de 5, salvo en el precio,  hace que no pueda recomendarlo.
No conozco todos los Hoteles de la Cadena Melia, de la que soy y seguiré siendo asiduo, pero es imposible que tengan otro con peor relación calidad/precio.",2,2016,11,02
28,excelente!!!,"Estuvimos alojados en este maravilloso hotel una noche, desde el primer momento te hacen sentir muy bien, como un amigo que te abre las puertas de su casa, decir que la habitacion es nueva donde destaca su diseño y su tv de 55"" y el desayuno de buffet a la carta muy bueno y el personal de todas las areas muy atentos y amables, estamos acostumbrados a viajar y debemos decir que nos sorprendio gratamente.",5,2016,11,02
28,Gran hotel,"Muy bonito, moderno y con un personal que da un servicio exquisito. De los pocos en los q puedes pedir unos benedictine hechos en el momento.
Habitaciones muy bien decoradas y con todo lo que se puede esperar en un hotel de categoría, incluida Nespresso en la habitación.
Grandes vistas a barna/mar",5,2016,10,20
28,Aspettative rispettate,"Ci siamo stati per tre notti. Stanza al 18 piano con vista città. Sinceramente reputo la stanza un po' piccola in dimensione per un 5*. Bellissima vista se non fosse stato per il degrado visibile proprio sulla strada sotto l'hotel. Il personale come anche il servizio molto attutivo cortese e veloce. Reception ottima con l'offerta di Bicchieri di Cava. Colazione e veranda
lounge al 24 piano con panorama eccezionale. Ottimo buffet con molte varianti. Servizio un po' confuso forse per i troppi clienti presenti. Per il bar ottimo bar tender. Un ottima esperienza.",4,2016,09,30
28,Vivir  y sentir una experiencia con los cinco sentidos a través de las personas.,"Por motivos profesionales viajamos a Barcelona y desde hace cuatr años nos hospedamos en este Hotel. La Atención al cliente, sus servicios, las habitaciones, las instalaciones del hotel y las personas que allí trabajan en cada departamento cumplen nuestras expectativas al 100%. Buscan la excelencia como un hábito y lo consiguen ya que te hacen sentir como en tu casa y sobre todo destacaría la calidad de servicio y el trato personalizado que te ofrecen a diario para cubrir y satisfacer tus necesidades. ""Todos olvidamos lo que nos han dicho, lo que nos han hecho pero jamás olvidamos lo que nos han hecho sentir"". Así es nuestra experiencia en The Level at Meliá Barcelona Sky.",5,2016,09,10
28,"Struttura e servizio ""The level"" all'altezza delle aspettative","Hotel non centrale, ma scelto per altre qualità (mezzi e metropolitana a pochi passi ed efficienti). Tre notti passate in room al 26° piano (vista città) emozionante (unico appunto il nuovo grattacielo limitrofo in fase di ultimazione che impedisce la vista della Sagrada Familia, ma non è di fondamentale importanza, anzi ...). Servizio snack/drink ""The level"" unico e utilissimo (diversificato a seconda dell'orario). Personale, cordialità/disponibilità, servizio e pulizia camera (due volte al giorno) all'altezza delle aspettative. Colazione e servizio bar al 24° piano (vista mare o città) particolare. Piscina di piccole dimensioni con molte e comode sdraio con servizio bar. Spiaggia vicina (10 min. a piedi). Consigliato",5,2016,09,07
28,Validissimo,"Ottimo hotel in una zona nuova di Barca. Do 4 e non 5 a questa struttura solo per la distanza dal centro, la metro e' a 5' a piedi quindi ben collegato, ma forse io sono troppo abituata alle comodità. L albergo e' veramente molto valido, la parte the level    Direi eccellente. Camere pulitissime con tutti gli amenitis possibili, TV a parete, connessione free ovunque. Bagno molto scenografico. Piscina gratuita compresa al 6 piano e colazione mozzafiato al 24 piano, palestra piccolina è compresa. Personale disponibile e dedicatissimo per ogni piccola esigenza. Piccola segnalazione, mi sarebbe piaciuto trovare il mueslie, in una colazione spettacolare, mancava solo quello. Perfetto

",4,2016,09,06
28,Barcellona dal 18° piano,"Splendido Hotel, un grattacielo dalla forma architettonica veramente bello. Avevamo la stanza al 18° piano dalla quale si ammirava un panorama mozzafiato.La colazione veniva servita al 24° piano con una vista ancora più incredibile, ottima la qualità, la quantità e la varietà dei prodotti offerti,  ed il personale veramente cortese e disponibile. La stanza era molto pulita e confortevole con frigo e macchina per il caffè a disposizione. L'unico piccolo neo, a mio parere, era la conformazione del bagno che aveva una grande vetrata che dava sulla camera, sicuramente molto scenografica ed elegantissima, ma dava l'impressione di godere di scarsa ""privacy"" in momenti ""particolari"".
Una chicca dell'accoglienza era invece la possibilità di usufruire di un buffet, disponibile e completamente gratuito, in qualsiasi momento della giornata, senza alcun limite alle consumazioni.
Veramente splendido ci tornerei sicuramente.",5,2016,08,23
28,Sempre meglio....,"Uh esperienza fantastica iniziata con ( ahimè ) un check in non perfetto a causa di una incomprensione per la quale ci siamo trovati in una camera con un po' di problemi al piano 17 ....
Chiarito il disguido dalla mattina seguente è stato un costante andare a rasentare la perfezione su tutto ,a partire dalla disponibilità e dalla presenza costante del personale ,fino ad arrivare alla qualità del cibo proposto ...
Hotel che porto nel cuore .
A prestissimo!!!",5,2016,08,16
28,Un remanso de paz ,"Un rincón muy agradable. La piscina, con un estilo muy moderno, de estructura metálica. El ambiente con música chill out, cómodos pufs y hamacas.
El lugar ideal para pasar un día de calor tanto en pareja como con amigos.
Lo único a mejorar: los baños ",4,2016,08,06
28,Lejos de lo esperado,"No solo está lejos de todos los lugares de interés de cualquier turista, sino que tampoco tiene el nivel de un cinco estrellas. Esta a 45 minutos a pie de plaza Catalunya y en la zona en la que está emplazado no hay nada (por ahora) que valga la pena ver. Es un barrio nuevo que se está desarrollando y puede ser cómodo paralos que viajen por negocios y tengan su oficinas cerca, pero no es para recomendar al turista medio. Más allá de la buena voluntad del staff el hotel y de la habitación que era cómoda y bien puesta, los servicios generales no son ni por asomo de un cinco estrellas Son muchos pisos y muchas habitaciones por piso, por ende mucha gente, demoras en los ascensores para el desayuno. gente de limpieza desde temprano tocando puertas y limpiando, sector de la pileta totalmente ocupado... Para mi fue debut y despedida La calificación no fue mas baja porque la gente que allí trabaja no lo merece, pero el concepto del hotel si.",3,2016,07,26
28,A día de hoy no es un 5 estrellas. Demasiados errores.,"¿Porqué un Hotel ubicado en un edificio e instalaciones admirables con un equipo humano competente y encantador comete errores de bulto como tener en obras zonas claves del hotel en plena temporada alta, con averías inadmisibles y falta de muchos productos incluidos en las cartas?
Ante estas situaciones la responsabilidad obviamente se atribuye a la Dirección.",3,2016,07,12
28,Execelente,"De los mejores hoteles en Barcelona! Las habitaciones estan renovadas y modernas. Muy completo para las horas de relax, poder ir a la piscina y spa! Las vistas son espectaculares y el desayuno en la planta 24 increíble! Siempre que voy a Barcelona, me vale la pena dormir en este hotel! ",5,2016,07,10
28,COMO EN CASA,"Tras reformar las habitaciones, continúa siendo un hotel de Lujo y con un elevado nivel, tanto en lo personal como en el servicio. Esta vez sí pudimos disfrutar de la piscina y de sus inmejorables vistas. Como siempre gracias por vuestra esmerada atención.",5,2016,07,05
28,Buena elección en Barcelona,"Hace unas tres semanas pasamos una noche en el hotel. La experiencia como cabía esperar de un Meliá fue muy buena. 
La atención de los empleados del hotel fué excelente.

Check in exclusivo para los clientes de las habitaciones The level al lado del lounge, rápido y eficaz. El lounge genial, mantienen un buen surtido de snacks y bebidas, tanto alcoholicas como refrescos, además de que las vistas desde el mismo son muy buenas, tal vez el lounge en si es algo pequeño, pero me imagino que tiene que ver con la propia distribución interior del hotel, pero lo recomiendo al 100% después de un dia de turismo por la ciudad.

Las habitaciones están bien, TV de pantalla plana grande, cama de matrimonio y vistas desde la cama espectaculares, nuestra habitación estaba en la planta 19, minibar bien surtido, y tal vez el punto negativo a las habitaciones lo pondría en el baño. Es grande y adaptado a personas con movilidad reducida, pero la separación entre el baño y la habitación es un cristal que, sorpresa!!!, no tiene cortinilla ni nada para preservar una cierta intimidad, lo cual me sorprendió. No hay bañera, únicamente ducha y sin mamparas, supongo que por ser baño adaptado y la taza del lavabo está tan cerca de la ducha que al ducharte si no lo hacías con cuidado se mojaba toda.

Para acabar con algo positivo, el desayuno en la planta baja del hotel es muy bueno, es un espacio muy amplio, con mucha variedad de alimentos y buena calidad, además de una excepcional atención por parte del personal y prensa gratuita.

En definitiva, es un hotel para tener en cuenta en Barcelona, y la opción the level merece la pena.",4,2016,06,06
28,Guapísimo hotel y staff muy profesional,"Estuvimos alojados una noche en el hotel y probamos el level, nos encantó un trato muy personalizado a nuestra llegada , la cortesía de los trabajadores increíble, sobretodo del camarero Patricio que nos atendió muy educadamente y muy profesional, estuvo atento en todo . Pase una estancia muy agradable. Repetiré seguramente e invitó a pasar esta experiencia única gracias",5,2016,06,01
28,"Schönes Hotel, freundliches und professionelles Personal","Schöne Zimmer, gute Lage , die Aussicht zur Stadt ist toll, hier sieht man auf Parc Güell und Sagrada Familia - Taxi vor dem Haus, öffentliche Verkehrsmittel ebenfalls Tram und U Bahn. 
Der Strand ist fussläufig erreichbar da. 10 Minuten, Umgebung ok. 
Frühstücksbüffet qualitativ sehr gut alles frisch und selbstgemacht- i h denke bei der Bioecke ist noch etwas Luft nach oben- ich habe versucht einfaches Müsli ohne Zucker zu bekommen oder einfache Haferflocken- war auch bei 6 Übernachtungen nicht möglich - das finde ich sehr schade die habe ich mir dann selber im Supermarkt gekauft - schade sonst alles prima. 
Snacks im Level wären von sehr guter Qualität- angenehme Atmosphäre. 
Pool sehr  klein wie in allen Stadthotels, reicht aber um ein wenig in der Sonne zu entspannen. Fitnessraum zweckmäßig aber vollkommen ok, Wellnesbereich geht so sehr klein.  Alles in allem ein schönes Hotel.",4,2016,05,17
28,"... nett, aber leider abgerockt! ","Das waren keine 5 Sterne... Die Aussicht aus unserem Zimmer im 29. Stock war zweifelsohne grandios, das Innere dagegen weniger. So fragt man sich, wer warum scheinbar den Schrank um seine Schiebetür erleichtert hat und warum ein Duschvorhang mit undefinierbaren Flecken (Farbe? Bleichmittel?) die Regendusche verunziert... Die Duschwand eher ein schiefes Provisorium mit unverputzten Fugen... Der Badbereich ist vom Schlafbereich durch eine Glasscheibe getrennt, was zwar die Privatsphäre beeinträchtigt, aber zumindest nett aussieht. Leider heißt das, dass man sich zum in-den-Spiegel-schauen um die Ecke biegen muss, und ein Ganzkörperspiegel fehlt völlig. Außerdem war das Zimmer sehr klein!
Das Team der Level-Lounge ist sehr engagiert und freundlich, beim Frühstück im Erdgeschoss war es allerdings nicht so einfach, bedient zu werden. Gut, dass wir nach oben flüchten konnten! 
Zusammenfassend ist das Hotel ok, Service mehrheitlich sehr gut, das Zimmer abgewohnt und keinesfalls 5Sterne-Standard!

28,Ottimo hotel,"Hotel ben curato nel quartiere di Poblenou, a pochi passi dalla metro e dal tram. Si tratta di un grattacielo stretto e alto, le camere hanno tutti i comfort e sono comode. Unico neo che devo sottolineare è il fatto che manca una porta con il bagno. È tutto aperto, si sente e si vede tutto. 
Per il resto personale gentilissimo, tant'è che la sera del mio compleanno mi hanno portato una torta con prosecco!! Un pensiero che proprio fa piacere.",4,2016,04,24

28,Experiencia única,"La mejor elección que hemos hecho en cuestión de hoteles. Hemos pasado 5 noches en un marco muy agradable, rodeados de un personal siempre atentos a nuestro más mínimo deseo, siempre sonrientes, amables, con los que entablar una conversación fue de lo más fácil. Hemos disfrutado mucho del Lounge, sobre todo después de las jornadas de visitas turísticas, en el que hemos tenido un trato 
personalizado en todo momento: ellos se ocuparon de llamar al taxi, de reservar las visitas y de aconsejarnos sobre visitas que sin su consejo no hubiéramos hecho.

La habitación estaba bien pero necesita un refresco más que urgente. 

El servicio de habitaciones es rápido y eficaz, como corresponde a un 5 estrellas.

Del desayuno en la planta baja solo podemos decir: EXCELENTE, no sólo por la calidad sino también por la cantidad. Y el servicio inmejorable, siempre pendientes de que no faltara café en la taza, que no hubiera platos vacíos en la mesa... y todo con una gran sonrisa y muchísima simpatía. 

Ha sido una experiencia única que repetiremos sin duda alguna en este hotel o en otro de la cadena Meliá.",4,2016,04,14
28,Sorpresa di Pasqua,"Veramente sorpresa da questo hotel , situato nel quartiere residenziale di Poblenau a due passi dalla metro. Le camere hanno vista mare o sulla Sagrada Familia, la colazione ricchissima, al 25 piano è possibile gustare ottimi brunch gratuitamente fino al pomeriggio. Cosa migliorare? La debole illuminazione dei bagni e la collocazione degli specchi. Nulla da eccepire per il resto. Un particolare ringraziamento al personale della reception.",4,2016,03,28
28,Experiencia muy buena,"Como habitual de Melia, escogimos este hotel para la Semana Santa, fue un acierto porque The Level se respira en el ambiente; el personal amabilísimo y dispuesto en todo momento con una gran sonrisa.
La habitación muy bien y las vistas también.
La recepción en la 25 con 2 personas y los camareros contamos hasta 3 a la vez muy atentos.
El spa justito pero suficiente. 
La única molestia son los golpes de los obreros a las 8h... Pero creo que hay que ser condescendientes con todos los trabajadores y aguantarlo un poco,puesto que es para beneficio posterior (porque son obras de mejora en el hotel)
Volveremos sin dudarlo.",5,2016,03,26
28,"Sencillamente, exquisito","Nos ofrecieron al Experiencia Level al llegar al Hotel y no dudamos en aceptar. La calidez del recibimiento, la exquisitez del personal y la tranquilidad de las instalaciones hacen que vivas la experiencia VIP de Melia a un precio razonable. 

Totalmente recomendable",5,2016,03,24
28,Extraordinario ,"Hotel moderno ubicado en la parte oeste de Diagonal. Las habitaciones son muy luminosas. El Level dispone en la planta 25 de una gran sala polivalente: recepción, zona de snacks disponible desde las 7 a.m hasta las 11h, desayuno, sala de lectura, etc. La atención es de primera clase. Personas amabilísimas pendientes en todo momento de satisfacer al cliente. Trató absolutamente personal. Es una gran experiencia que merece la pena vivir",5,2016,03,24
28,Fin de semana en las alturas,"Hemos tenido el placer de pasar un maravilloso fin de semana en Barcelona alojados en este espectacular rascacielos.
Las vistas tanto al mar como a toda la ciudad son realmente fantásticas.
El trato del personal, tanto de recepción, como dirección y servicios (sala level, desayuno, etc...) ha sido inmejorable, en todo momento han estado plenamente a nuestra disposición, atendiendo cualquier necesidad que hayamos podido tener.
Nuestra habitación, recién reformada, presenta unas calidades y un diseño exquisito.
Respecto al ""the level"", es un nuevo concepto de hotel, donde hacen sentirte como un huésped muy especial. Una vez probado, seguro que repetimos.
Ya estamos deseando pasar un nuevo fin de semana en la ciudad condal para repetir experiencia en este lujoso hotel.",5,2016,03,21

28,LA no experiencia,"Realmente decepcionante, llegamos y el hotel esta en obras sin que nadie nos los avisara en la reserva, el Level es muy pobre . Nos cambiaron de habitación y el cambio tardo una hora ejecutarse . En el desayuno , a pesar de no ser mas de 10 personas en el comedor y haber 3 camareras  , nadie nos  retiro los platos en 30 minutos ni se puso cafe en nuestra mesa, ademas se dedicaron durante la hora y 30 minutos a estar moviendo mesas en el comedor con la consiguiente molestia a todos los que estabamos alli ( eran las 0930 AM ) con una desidia digna de ver. A la hora del check out tuvimos que subir dos veces a la recepción a solucionar el problema de que el cajero del parking no aplicaba los precios para los huespedes a pesar de haber preguntado hasta 3 veces en Level  y la recepción . Lo unico positivo es que la final Guest Experience Manager en persona nos soluciono el problema. Algo mal funciona en ese hotel...... todo funciona sin ilusión.... en la reforma deberian incluir a la Dirección , no es aceptable que un hotel de esta cadena este gestionado de forma tan pesima .",1,2016,02,01
28,Muy chulo,El hotel en si esta muy bien. Se le ve que han pasado unos años desde que abrio pero esta chulisimo. Nos cambiaron de habitacion porque la que nos toco era lane la esquina y la calefaccion no funcionaba bien. Por todo lo demas la estancia fue fabulosa.,5,2016,01,28

28,Buon 5 stelle con qualche pecca,"Dal 29 dicembre 2015 al 1° gennaio 2016.
Bella camera al 20° piano con una splendida vista sulla città.
Ottima l'accoglienza del preparatissimo personale. Qualche piccola pecca che non mi consente di dare il massimo voto di soddisfazione:
1) La camera accoglientissima ha un grande comodo lettone con diversi cuscini e un bel piumone. Peccato che se decidi di farne a meno non sai proprio dove metterli se non sul divanetto che darà poi l'aspetto di un accampamento.
2) Una mattina si è messo uno dei due asciugamani a terra per il cambio. Il telo è stato portato via ma il ricambio non è stato effettuato perchè, come ci ha detto la cameriera al piano, quando l'hotel è pieno non ci sono sufficienti teli!
3) Il frigo bar - caruccio, ma ci sta - non viene rifornito se non dopo richiesta.
4) Due volte abbiamo fatto la colazione su tavoli e sedie da sostituire perchè danneggiati. Ci è stato detto che sono in corso miglioramenti. Sarà.
Tutto questo non ci ha però impedito di fare un buon soggiorno però da un 5 stelle mi aspettavo un servizio più che perfetto.",4,2016,01,15
28,Mi aspettavo di più,"Abbiamo passato 5 notti in questo hotel. La struttura esternamente è di effetto. Per il resto in alocuni aspetti lascia un po a desiderare. Le camera sembrano costruite con materiali scadenti. Il bagno è piccolissino e la vista tanto decantata, è coperta da un palazzo in costriuzione. Noi eravamo al piano 21 e non si vedeva + la sagrada famiglia e torre  di Agbar. Si comincia a intravedere qualcosa dal piano 25 al piano 29. Consiglio comunque una camera Level, quelle che hanno la reception al 25° Piano. Qui il servizio prestato fa scordare la mediocrità del resto. Il personale è estremamente gentile e disponibile. Poichè a noi la camera non  piaceva, hanno fatto di tutto per cercare di cambiarcela. Sempre al 25° piano è disponoibile il servizio colazione, + limitato come scelta ma con una qualità superior. Inoltre dale 7 alle 23, c'è disponibilta di bevande e stuzzichini. Se dovessi tornare in questo hotel, sceglierei un junior suit al 29° piano. Lì potrei quasi dare  5 pallini.,",3,2016,01,11
28,Scherben bringen Glück?,"Drei Nächte in der Junior-Suite, 1 Erwachsene, 2 Jugendliche. Bis zum Schluss hatte man den Eindruck, dass niemand so recht wusste, wie viele Personen welchen Alters die Suite belegten. Das Extra-Bett, Handtücher etc. mussten  wir selbst organisieren. Am ersten Tag erwartete uns abends ein Gruß des Hauses auf dem Zimmer. Nette Geste - leider befand sich in der Schokolade eine Glasscherbe (???). Als wir das gemeldet hatten, war die Aufregung groß. Man wollte uns jeden Wunsch erfüllen ""the whole team will  remain  at your entre disposal for anything you need"". Uns fiel erst einmal nichts ein. ""Please do not hesitate ""... Dann doch: Vielleicht ein Shuttle zum Flughafen? Hatten sie nicht. (???) Später: Man würde versuchen, evtl. etwas zu arrangieren, vllt ein Taxi (???). Am nächsten Tag: man sei immer noch dabei zu schauen, ob evtl. etwas möglich sei .., (???). Wir sind dann abgereist, ohne herauszufinden, ob es einem 5-Sterne-Hotel innerhalb von 2 Tagen möglich ist, ein Taxi zu bekommen. Während wir im Flugzeug saßen, hat die Rezeption bei uns zu Hause angerufen. Es hatte geklappt! Sonst aber alles gut!",4,2016,01,07
28,Traumhafte Aussicht über Barcelona,"Der Empfang mit einem Frontest befindet sich im 25. Stock. Dort befindet sich auch ein kleines Frühstücksbuffet welches nach elf Uhr morgens mit Nusshäppchen und Getränken 24 h zugänglich ist. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet und sehr sinnvoll mit Schiebetüren ausgestattet. Weshalb es im WC keine Bürste gab, ist mir nicht klar. Dafür wurde das Zimmer zwei Mal am Tag gemacht. Die Angestellten waren sehr zuvorkommend. Im 6. Stock befindet sich eine Liegefläche draussen mit Pool und Lounge. Der SPA-Bereich ist relativ klein und ist gut besucht, jedoch stillvoll eingerichtet.",5,2016,01,04
28,Anche fosse solo X la vista,"Comoda e accogliente la camera.. Dal 26 piano la vista è davvero magnifica.. Elemento che emoziona.. Tutto la esalta! Davvero bello! Buffet con bevande e stuzzichini sempre disponibile X gli ospiti del the level, receptionisti cordiali e efficienti anche in
Un periodo di super affluenza come il capodanno.. Piccola (forse un po troppo la spa).. Se non affollata e' comunque super godibile. Consigliato",5,2016,01,02
28,Exclusividad y buen gusto,"No tengo palabras para describir mi estancia en The Level. El trato de Catalina en la recepción exclusiva es absolutamente fantástica, la atención de todo el personal con el que tuve placer de tratar es excelente.

28,Excelente!!! lo mas alto y top de BARCELONA,"Como toda la cadena Melia en su opcion THE LEVEL, este es un grandioso hotel, con unas instalaciones muy modernas y de primera calidad, la suite de level es de verdad un paraiso con una vista inigualable, desde mi habitacion veia la iglesia de la Sagrada Familia de Goudi asi como tambien la vista parcial de Barcelona con la Torre Agbar al fondo, el salon para los que usan la opcion LEVEL, excelente con bebidas y tapas gratis todo el dia, de verdad lo recomiendo ciegamente, viaje con mi pareja y mi hija de 2 años",5,2015,12,29
28,Excelente servicio ,"Llegamos al Level con tres niños a pasar la noche de Navidad, y todo desde el primer minuto fue fantástico. Comenzando con el magnífico trato a los niños. La cómoda habitación. El Room service fantástico y en general cuidar hasta el mínimo detalle para un servicio excelente",5,2015,12,28
28,bien. seguro que se puede mejorar,"Estuvimos perfectamente. Piso 23. Habitacion muy amplia y con esplendidas vistas a la ciudad.

Pequeño overbooking en The Level lounge. Una lastima que la flexibilidad en el check out solo fuera de 1 hora .

Desayunamos en la planta de desayunos , y el café era infumable, con una sola cafetera para toda la sala y hacia frio. Supongo que esa sala es provisional por las obras del hotel  . spa diminuto .",4,2015,12,28
28,Así se hace Meliá,"He visitado por asuntos de trabajo y de ocio un montón de hoteles de la cadena Meliá y de otras cadenas y debo decir que el trato recibido en The Level ha superado con creces todo lo que he visto. Una recepción personalizada donde los chicos te ayudan en todo lo que necesitas, con ellos puedes conversar de cualquier tema y con mucha profesionalidad te saludan como si fueras un viejo amigo. Bienvenido a Casa me ha dicho Yusel de la recepción y ciertamente como en mi casa me he sentido. El bufé en la planta 25 está muy bien y siempre tienes una excelente selección de bebidas y aperitivos al alcance de tu mano sin coste adicional. El Spa aunque pequeño es muy funcional. la Habitación vista al mar es muy cómoda, espaciosa y moderna y las vistas son las mejores de Barcelona. Un Hotel apartado del centro de la ciudad ideal para relajarse, pero si quieres un poco del bullicio del centro pues a 10 min en metro o tranvía, muy bien comunicado. lo más destacable de mi estancia: el personal. Así se hace chicos. sin dudas regresaré muy pronto.",5,2015,12,22
28,Excellente,"Un hotel fantastico con unas increibles vistas y un personal muy atento.
Recepción privada en la planta 25 con copa de cava.
El Level Lounge para tomar algo durante todo el día con unas vistas increibles de la ciudad.
Habitación Junior Suite Exec. amplia y bien equipada con vistas al mar.
Un personal encantador y siempre preparado para atender cualquier petición.
Un hotel para repetir.",4,2015,12,20
28,Segundas partes si fueron buenas. Hotel excelente.,"Hotel en el que repetimos, por amabilidad, servicio, calidad y modernidad. Nos trataron de manera inmejorable, cuidando hasta el más mínimo detalle. Si buscas algo diferente, con unas vistas increíbles, sentirte cuidado, bien atendido y recibir un trato personal, cercano y profesional, no dudes en visitar este hotel. Recomendable pedir habitación cara al mar para unas vistas poco comunes en Barcelona y poder disfrutar de un amanecer espectacular. Amenities de alta calidad y con posibilidad de pedir más si es necesario. Buena cama para descansar, bañera y ducha insuperables. Destacar que ofrecen una recepción personalizada en el lounge donde puedes descansar, comer y beber sin límite en un ambiente elegante y tranquilo a 25 pisos de altura. WIFI muy bueno.Sin duda un hotel a tener en cuenta. Gracias a todo su personal y en especial a Catalina y Fernando, así como Yusel y la camarera del room service que tan bien preparó la cena. Volveremos seguro.",5,2015,12,17
28,"Buen servicio, necesita renovar o mantener habitaciones","La experiencia buena aun así las habitaciones necesitan renovación ya que tienen algunas partes desgastadas, pero el servicio muy bueno como todos los Level de Melia. La situación no es muy buena pero tienes metro muy cercano. Las vistas son impresionantes.",4,2015,12,14
28,"""Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis!""","Das gesamte Personal ist hoch motiviert, mein Zimmer im Level 27. Etage 
gehört zur absoluten Superklasse. Der Ausblick in Richtung City -Sagrada
ist von der 27.Etage nachts einmalig. Die Ausstattung des Zimmers Nummer
2702, insbesondere der Grundriss ist sehr sehr gut.",4,2015,12,11
28,Excelente,"Estuvimos una noche en este hotel por negocios y nos ha encantado. La habitación vistas al mar es impresionante. La zona de desayuno muy buena sin grandes aglomeraciones, muy exclusivo. El precio fue muy bueno.
Muy buen servicio.",5,2015,12,11
28,Servicio excelente,"Reservé en The Level y la verdad es que valió la pena. Unas vistas fantásticas de la ciudad y bebidas y figer food siempre disponible para picotear entre horas o tomar una copa de cava. Además hay mucha rotación y aunque sean pequeños bocados estaban deliciosos y es suficiente para una merienda o un picoteo a media tarde o al mediodía.

El nivel de servcicio es excelente, a la altura de las expectativas generadas. Todo el personal es amable y atento. Repetiré sin duda en cuanto aterrice de nuevo en Bcn.

El spa, sin ser grande es suficiente. Yo fui en sábado y estuvimos solos.",5,2015,12,10
28,Fantástico hotel ,"Están reformando las habitaciones
Diseño moderno, buen ambiente y un servicio impecable.
Muy recomendable hotel y bien comunicado 
Cuidan hasta el más mínimo detalle
Recomiendo mucho The level con su lounge exclusiva 
Spa muy confortable, aunque algo pequeño, logra cubrir todas las expectativas 
Restaurante dos cielos con una estrella michelin que brinda un plus a la estancia 
Lo que más me impresionó fue el servicio: muy bueno
",5,2015,12,08
28,FANTASTICO HOTEL,"Moderno, amplio, muchos espacios, gran desayuno, personal atento y servicial...por poner una pega que esta un poco apartado del centro.
El servicio The Level como en todos los Melia excepcional y muy atentos.
El Yhi Spa también esta a la altura",5,2015,11,26
28,Confortevole,"Abbiamo soggiornato al Melia in questo fine settimana. La nostra camera pulita comoda e luminosa,  al 20 piano affacciava con una veduta alla sagrada familia. Il personale diponibile e cordiale. La colazione a buffet abbondante (buono il cappuccino). Da apprezzare il buffet messo a disposizione al level del 25 piano dalle 7 alle 23 con diverse bevande ed appetizer. L'albergo è ubicato in una zona tranquilla e moderna. La metropolitana molto vicina. Consigliato.",4,2015,11,15
28,No es un cinco estrellaa,"Bastante mejorable

Si q es cierto q el precio no es excesivo pero no es un cinco estrellas. Deja bastante q desear. Estuve alojada en una Junior suite. Bueno necesitaba una reforma urgente. Cosas descuidadas y rotas como la pantalla de la lampara del saloncito. Toalla viejas, suelos sucios. En fin un montón de cosas q cuando entras a la habitación no te da buena impresión . Las vistas estupendas estuve alojada en la última planta. La atención de recepción muy buena. El spa pequeñito pero agradable. Conclusión bastante mejorable, no volvería a ese hotel
",2,2015,10,18
28,Inolvidable,"Recordando las vacaciones de verano me animo a escribir por fin la opinión. Nos alojamos en el level tres días en agosto. El hotel es precioso y la tranquilidad total, la comida excelente y el servicio muy bueno. Justo lo que buscábamos. Recomendaría reservar la cama balinesa para completar la experiencia. Muy satisfechos con la estancia y deseando volver! ",5,2015,10,14
28,Un lugar donde no existe el no,Estuve alojado en este hotel por una estancia corta por asuntos de trabajo y debo decir que me sentí como en casa primeramente por el personal que es muy servicial y siempre tienen una respuesta eficiente para cualquier petición. A las habitaciones hay que darles un repaso pero la verdad que The Level en el piso 25 y la atencion que brindan compensan cualquier defecto que se pueda señalar Catalina y Yousef siempre tienen una sonrisa y dispuestos a ayudar en lo que necesites. Tambien hay una sala de reuniones en el piso 25 con excelentes vistas que puedes utilizar para una reunion. ,5,2015,10,14
28,Horrible 5 estrellas y MELIA!!,No hay derecho que siga abierta las plantas de LEVEL al precio de un 5 estrellas!! Yo entré en 5 habitaciones y cada cual estaba peor. Suelo y baños rotos literalmente. Al final m ofrecieron una habitación de la planta 16 que es un 4 estrellas que si estaba bien. Me siento estafada porque pague la de 5 y no me ofrecieron nada a cambio por bajarme a la de 4. Lo peor q es q no me esperaba esto de un hotel respaldado por la marca MELIA.,1,2015,10,13
28,Absolut empfehlenswert!,"Wir wurden superfreundlich empfangen, direkt in die ""The Level""-Zone begleitet und dort koknnten wir in Ruhe den Check-in machen. Alle Angestellten sind sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Das Hotel ist schön, Zimmer gut (Seaview) und auch die Lage ist okay. Den ganzen Tag waren Häppchen und kostenlose Getränke (Cola, Limo, Sekt, Rot-/Weisswein) zur Verfügung.",5,2015,09,29
28,Tolles Hotel,"wir hatten ein fantastischen Aussicht über fast ganz Barcelona. Der Strand ist zu Fuß in ca. 15. min bequeme Spaziergang zu erreichen, der nächste Metro-Station in 5 min.
In der 25. Stockwerk ist eine extra Lobby für die Gäste von Level mit ganztägig offene Bar. Wir haben mit  Frühstück gebucht, und hatten die Wahl oben in 25. Stockwerk zu frühstücken mit herrlichen Ausblick ( kleine Buffet aber große Auswahl) oder unten (innen oder Außenterrasse) mit sehr großem Auswahl. Oben hatten wir   von 7:00 bis 22:00 die Getränke (Wein, Softgetränke, Kaffee, Tee) und das Buffet inklusive. Pool und Spa zwar sehr schön, haben wir aber nicht genutzt. Toll eingerichtet, sehr freundliches Personal. Jeder Zeit wieder.",5,2015,09,29
28,""" Wir haben uns wie zu Hause gefühlt""","Nach der Zimmer Renovation wird das Hotel ein 
5* Plus sein

Danke. Danke ",5,2015,09,20
28,Hay que cuidar más los detalles y necesita reformas,"Nos alojamos dos noches, en The Level, La recepción en la planta 25, aunque habíamos hecho el on line check in porque llegábamos tarde, tardó un rato largo en el que nos invitaron a una cerveza, porque había bastantes clientes y una única persona atendiendo. Nos pidieron disculpas y bueno, no le dimos más importancia. 

La ubicación está lejos del centro, pero nos permitió descubrir el barrio del Poblet Nou, que además estaba en fiestas, muy animado y con buena oferta gastronómica. 

Por la noche a eso de las 7:00 de la mañana me despertó un goteo fuerte, resulta que había una gotera en la habitación, en la zona del baño, tuve que poner una toalla para evitar resbalar en el charco del suelo y me traté de volver a dormir, pero era muy molesto. A eso de las 9:00 ya nos levantamos, y cuando fuimos al desayuno avisé del tema, enseguida nos ofrecieron otra habitación, una suite a la que nos cambiamos tras el desayuno. Menos mal que había disponibilidad y además siendo categoría platino en el programa MAS de Meliá deberían haberme ofrecido el upgrade el primer día, pero bueno. La suite era más amplia, pero está con aspecto de viejo, desconchones en la pared donde da el pomo de la puerta de entrada, y el mobiliario del baño desgastado por el uso. 

Esta habitación tenia al lado de la puerta una de servicio donde estuvo tirada en el suelo una colcha (imagino que usada) toda la mañana del domingo, salimos del hotel a las 10 y volvimos a las 13 y seguía allí. Detalles que no creo que se deban permitir en un establecimiento que publicita ""The experience"" la verdad es que esperaba más. 

Es un hotel de categoría media, no de lujo. La piscina está bien, es agradable, pequeña, pero igualmente detalles como toallas usadas encima de tumbonas que se quedan allí horas sin que nadie las recoja... una botella de agua que se voló (vacia) flotando en la piscina, que sacamos del agua porque daba una sensación que no me parece apropiada para este hotel. El trato bien, pero hubiese preferido menos atenciones y que cuidasen los detalles generales (lo de la colcha me impactó). Si vuelvo a Barcelona, no creo que vuelva a este hotel.",3,2015,09,14
28,Estancia fantastica,"Hemos estado mi pareja y yo una semana, ya nos habian recomendado este hotel y sin lugar a dudas ha sido genial, nos hemos sentido muy a gusto, con todo en general, las vistas son impresionantes, y el servicio del piso 25 the level fenomenal, muy atento todo el equipo, sobretodo un chico muy simpatico que nos dio la bienvenida llamado yusel, toda la informacion y orientacion q necesitamos de la ciudad no dudo en ofrecerla, recomendandonos muy buenos restaurantes, muchas gracias a todos por su atencion, repetiremos!",5,2015,08,23
28,Fantastico,"Abbiamo soggiornato per un week end a Dicembre in una Junior Suite al 12* piano. Vista spettacolare sul mare e camera dotata di tutti i confort. Vicinissima alla diagonal con tram e metro e a 10 minuti dal centro. Colazione molto ricca e personale professionale e cortese. 
Esperienza meravigliosa.",5,2015,08,18
28,Excelente atencion..,"Es un hotel moderno, es un edificio con 25 pisos, la pileta es buena , el Spa es muy bueno lo que es sauna, esta incluido en el servicio aprovenchenlo ..su personal es muy atento y profesional... las habitaciones silenciosas y las camas muy buena se puede 
descansar, esta cerca de la playa x lo que se puede ir caminando ..
. al centro un taxi cuesta 8* 9 E..el desayuno muy bueno... (el cafe mas o menos, )pidan el expreso.es mejor.... En general muy bueno... volveria otra vez!!",4,2015,08,12

28,Estancia genial,"El trato recibido desde el primer momento fue muy bueno! La habitación magnifica!! Muy espaciosa y con preciosas vistas! 
La ubicación, para nosotros fue estupenda, no está en el centro pero tiene fácil acceso!!
El buffet del desayuno muy variado y el personal muy amable.
El wifi no termina de ir demasiado bien.",5,2015,07,27
28,Leider eine Enttäuschung,"Warum leider? Weil das The Level at Melia Sky eine wirklich ambitionierte junge Servicemannschaft hat. Leider reicht das nicht für eine positive Bewertung, weil das Hotel und auch das Konzept des ""The Level"" hier an schweren Mängeln krankt. Die Lage wurde hier bereits ausführlich besprochen, nicht zentral und auch nicht direkt am Strand - aber durchaus ok. Nur mit dem Taxi nervt die Straße stadtauswärts zum Hotel (Carrer Pere IV), weil immer absolut jede Ampel auf rot geht. Eigentlich ist die Metro die bessere Wahl, nur mag ich sonst keinen ÖPNV und nachts geht es nunmal nicht anders als mit dem Taxi.

Das 29stöckige Hotel ist noch relativ neu, aber schon erstaunlich abgewohnt. Schon das Designkonzept mit viel Edelstahl innen und außen verlangt einfach ein Maximum an Reinigung und Pflege. Melia spendiert die dann aber nicht. Alles ist schon jetzt vergammelt und abgewohnt, nirgends spiegelt der Edelstahl sauber. Unsere Tür am Zimmer 2903 sah aus wie mit fettigem Butterbrotpapier behandelt. Die Edelstahlblenden vor den Fenstern sind ein Designgimmick, spenden keinen Schatten aber verhindern eine angenehme Aussicht.

Im Zimmer lag permanent ein muffiger Geruch, der uns bis nach Hause begleitete, da dort alle Bekleidungsstücke den üblen Geruch angenommen hatten. Alles ist ein Fall für die Wäsche oder gar Reinigung. Die Fenster können vor allem im 29. Stock natürlich nicht geöffnet werden. Die Bad und WC-Einheit ist offen mit nicht abschließbaren oder auch nur abzudunkelndem Fenster zum Bett hin. Privacy gibt es keine. Waschbecken und Dusche sowie die hellen Estrichböden im Zimmer sehen schlicht abgewohnt aus.

Das The Level-Konzept fusst auf einem separaten Check-in in der The Level Lounge in der 25. Etage. Gut gemeint - schlecht umgesetzt. Die Check-in Unterlagen habe ich bereits am Tag zuvor per E-Mail geschickt, dann wurde nochmal alles wiederholt - wegen eines ""double check"". Ich glaube ich spinne. Das ganze wie gesagt in der The Level Lounge, die eigentlich der besonderen Entspannung der Gäste dienen soll. Statt dessen ist wegen dieser Vorgänge ein ständiges Palaver mit an- oder abreisenden Gästen.

In der 6. Etage befindet sich gemeinsam mit dem sonstigen Hotel Melia Sky der Pool. Klein, fein aber auch schon mitgenommen. Die WCs sollte man hier nicht freiwillig aufsuchen, schon weil man die Tür nicht abschließen kann.

Frühstück kann man im Erdgeschoss mit den Melia Sky Gästen gemeinsam einnehmen oder in reduzierter Größe in der The Level Lounge. Wir kehrten in Windeseile vom Erdgeschoss in die Lounge zurück, da unten ein unsäglicher Trubel herrschte, der an das Lied von Reinhard Mey mit der ""heißen Schlacht am kalten Büffet"" erinnerte.

Nochmal, für die jungen Leute in der The Level Lounge tut es mir Leid. Sie strengen sich wirklich an, das Konzept The Level ist hier aber einfach daneben.",2,2015,07,19
28,"Magnifico, ubicación, trato, vistas, servicios.....un acierto seguro","Si te alojas no te decepcionará nada: 
- la ubicación es muy buena, en plena diagonal y pocos minutos en taxi o metro de la barceloneta, acuarium, zoo, barrio gotico, la sagrada famila etc.
- El servicio exquisito, si te puedes permitir la opción The Level es para no perderselo por las vistas de las habitaciónes un servicio exclusivo de recepción y bufet todo el día para que puedas leer, picar algo charlar, bajar al Spa... tienen una piscina fantastica.
- Si te gusta la alta cocina en la planta 24 puedes disfrutar del restaurante dos cielos 
- A nosotros nos dieron todo tipo de facilidades para quedarnos en el hotel porque nuestro vuelo salia tarde. (nunca he recibido este trato de faciclidad en ningun hotel del mundo y he recorrido mas de un centenar)
- En resumen un acierto seguro.",5,2015,07,14
28,Super Hotel mit toller Aussicht,"Das Hotel bietet seinen The Level Gästen (wir wohnten im 27. Stock) einen grandiosen Ausblick auf Barcelona bis hin zur berühmten Familia Sagrada und dem Montjuic. Unser Zimmer war modern eingerichtet mit offenem Badezimmer, Doppelwaschbecken, begehbarer Dusche und abgetrenntem WC - alles sehr grosszügig und sehr sauber, was natürlich auch täglich frische Handtücher miteinschliesst. Die Rezeption für the Level-Gäste ermöglicht einen schnellen und sehr angenehmen Check-in, denn in der Lounge kann man sich den ganzen Tag bis spät abends an Getränken (abends auch alkoholische), Snacks und Tapas bedienen. Das ist besonders toll, wenn man etwas erschöpft vom vielfältigen Kulturangebot Barcelonas, ins Hotel kommt und sich im 25.Stock erstmal eine kleine Erfrischung gönnt. Das Hotel liegt leider etwas ausserhalb, aber die U-Bahn Haltestelle ist nur 5 Minuten entfernt.
Lobenswert erwähnen möchte ich auch noch die hervorragenden Restaurantempfehlungen von Joep Timmermanns, der sich auch um unsere Tischreservierung kümmerte. Danke nochmal!",5,2015,07,01
28,Fantastica Barcellona,"Ho soggiornato con la mia ragazza in questo hotelper 4 giorni e fin dall'accoglienza è stato tutto perfetto.
tutto lo staff è sempre a tua disposizione per ogni evenienza.
le camere sono pulite, la nostra poi al 20 piano con vista mare era stupenda!!!
E per non farsi mancare nulla,nel giorno del compleanno della mia ragazza al nostro rientro ci troviamo una graditissima sorpresa...prosecco e fragole!!!!nel prossimo viaggio a Barcellona torneremo sicuramente!",5,2015,07,01
28,Fantástico!!!,"Hotel fantástico y bien situado. A 10 minutos de la playa andando y a 15 minutos del centro de Barcelona en transporte público. Las instalaciones modernas y el trato y atenciones muy buenos. Nos alojamos en una Executive Junior Suite impresionante con vistas al mar. Trato preferencial a los clientes Meliá Rewards. La sala The Level de la planta 25 sirve comidas y bebidas todo el día sin coste, y con vistas al skyline de Barcelona. Para repetir!!!",5,2015,06,28
28,"Hotel muy alto, pero es más alta su calidad humana","Verdaderamente, es dificil explicar con palabras la experiencia... Yo lo resumiría con un ""no existe el NO"". Sin duda el trato, el buen hacer, sentirse entre algodones.... Son todo cualidades del personal en el hotel y de la cadena, pero en the level Barcelona está elevado a la enésima potencia... 

Nuestra habitación estaba en la 26, y bueno en fin... No le faltaba de nada, minibar, secador, máquina nespresso... Y si falta algo, basta con llamar que en 5 min está resuelto, doy fe.

La piscina está muy bien, pero a última hora aquello está de pena, con toallas, papeles, vasos, ceniceros... Y ver a 3 personas del hotel (uno de los chicos, con traje y otra chica de recepción) recogiendo las cosas de los demás... Es un poco lamentable.... Deberían poner más papeleras con el fin de evitar el ""efecto ventana rota"" y carteles donde se recuerden comportamientos mínimos de civismo.

El spa aunque es pequeñito, no le falta detalle, todo funciona super bien y es todo muy nuevo. Además, el señor del spa es muy enrollado y te acompañará para explicarte el recorrido, dónde tomar un té, donde están los vestuarios... 

Muchas gracias a todo el personal, especialmente a the level, a Catalina, a Dani.... Desgraciadamente no sé vuestros nombres, pero habéis hecho que desde la llegada al hotel, hasta la despedida, la estancia haya sobrepasado las expectativas .... Siempre, haciendo gala de la amabilidad y con una sonrisa de oreja a oreja... Sin duda, cuando vayamos a Bcn, para nosotros, no habrá otra opción.

Esperamos volver a veros, de todo corazón.",5,2015,06,25
28,Una excelente opción,"Son pisos especiales dentro del Melía Barcelona sky, situados a partir del piso 25. Con una recepción especial, donde atienden a los huéspedes super bien, orientándoles y brindando toda la asistencia necesaria. Las habitaciones son amplias y comfortables, con vista al mar o a la ciudad. La limpieza y atención de las habitaciones muy buena. En el piso 25 hay una cafetería permanente donde tambien se puede desayunar o hacer un brunch a cualquier hora. Está ubicado a 10 cuadras del mar aproximadamente y a 3 cuadras de una estación de metro, muy cerca hay un centro comercial también.  Bares y restós muy lindos a pocas cuadras. Muy recomendable pasar un rato de descanso en la pileta o spa cuando el tiempo lo permite.",5,2015,06,22
28,Para repetir sin dudarlo,"Estuvimos alojados en la The Level Junior Suite en la planta 27. todo perfecto en lo referente a las instalaciones de la habitación, los servicios ofrecidos y la amabilidad de todo el personal, desde que entramos en el hotel, hasta la salida. El servicio The Level...¡fantástico!: la preparación minuciosa de los alimentos, la delicadeza en el trato de quienes nos atendieron... tenía muchas ganas de alojarme en un lugar tan detallista en el sentido de hacerte disfrutar de unos momentos sumamente agradables, tanto para mí como para mi familia",5,2015,06,10
28,Grandioses Hotel,"Dies ist ein wirklich tolles Hotel, welches ich nur empfehlen kann! Vom Anfang bis zum Ende wurden wir verwöhnt und konnten erholt abreisen!

Das Hotel ist mit dem Taxi in ca. 30 Minuten vom Flughafen aus erreichbar. Will man in das Stadtzentrum, nimmt man am besten die Metro, Stationen gibt es überall in der Nähe. Zu Fuß ist es allerdings zu weit zu laufen.

Der Empfang im Hotel war sehr angenehm, das Personal spricht gutes Englisch und der Check-In verlief schnell und unkompliziert. Das Hotel selbst ist topmodern und dementsprechend stylisch eingerichtet, man fühlt sich einfach gut!

Kaum im Zimmer angekommen, kam das nächste Lächeln in meine Gesicht. Der topmoderne und stylische Ersteindruck vom Hotel zog sich hier fort. Toll eingerichtet, groß und mit viel Gadgets ausgestattet, fühlt man sich einfach wohl. Wir waren ziemlich weit oben im Gebäude untergebracht, was uns eine tolle Aussicht auf Barcelona brachte. Geschlafen habe ich wie ein Baby. Es ist ruhig und angenehm im Zimmer. Das Bad ist groß und (wieder einmal) stylisch. Zur Sauberkeit bleibt dementsprechend nicht mehr viel zu sagen! Man hätte vom Boden essen können, so sauber war es.

Der Service im Hotel war durchweg sehr gut, von der Rezeption, über die Sky Bar, bis hin zum Frühstücksbuffet-Personal. Alle waren fleißig und diskret, so wie man es sich wünscht. Das Frühstücksbuffet selbst war grandios. Es gab nichts, was es nicht gab. Für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei, selbst frisch zubereitetet Eier konnte man sich bestellen. Das Frühstück war jedes Mal ein Genuss!

Ich kann dieses Hotel jedem empfehlen! Bin ich das nächste Mal in Barcelona, findet man mich sicher wieder dort, vor allem am Frühstücksbuffet...",5,2015,05,28
28,Muy buen hotel.,"La habitación ""gran premium vista al mar"" era amplia, con una cama muy cómoda y unas vistas increíbles al mar y parte de la ciudad. La conexión a wifi funcionaba bien y había un dock para iPod. El único problema que tuvimos es que al estar un fin de semana se escuchaba mucho ruido, como si hubiera alguna fiesta en otra habitación.

A destacar lo del personal de recepción The Level con el check in personalizado lo que es realmente muy bueno. Nos resolvieron todo de manera muy practica y rápida. Siempre muy atentos y dispuestos a ayudarnos con información turística o para sacar entradas para alguna atracción.

El sistema lounge en la planta 25 es un lugar muy bien preparado pero nos dejo un sinsabor en cuanto a comida. Nos pareció muy limitada la opción de snacks y bocadillos ofrecidos. En cuanto a bebidas nos parecio bueno (gaseosas, whisky, vinos, tequila, champagne y aperitivos).
Este servicio de lounge aunque este abierto hasta las 22, a las 21 o antes ya empiezan a retirar la comida, dejando solo bebidas.

El desayuno nos parecio bueno y con una buena carta de opciones para elegir.
Utilizamos el servicio de habitación y sus platos y postres fueron muy buenos. Este servicio tiene un costo adicional de 5 euros.

Comparar siempre el precio de la habitación contra la pagina de Melia, ya que reservando directamente con ellos se obtiene 20 euros diarios para gastar en minibar o servicio de habitación.",4,2015,05,03
28,Excelente,"Excelente sobre todo muy amables especialmente la persona  Ilyan de recepción , las instalaciones muy buenas y el desayuno grandioso. Las vistas de las habitaciones al mar muy bonitas, Para ir al centro de la ciudad se requiere taxi o una caminata de 25 minutos",5,2015,04,15
28,PERFECTO,"Era mi cumpleaños y decidimos pasar una noche en el The Level Melia Sky Barcelona, en la junior suite.

La llegada a la recepción fue fantástica como ya esperabamos, y el servicio The Level perfecto. 

El inconveniente que tengo es que anteriormente habiamos estado en una habitación premium y teniamos un equipo de música con clavija para el iphone nuevo y ahí a pasear de ser suite era del anterior por lo tanto no entraba.

Sé que es una tonteria pero soy bastante fan de la música y me gusta bastante poner música siempre.

Bajamos a cenar y tomar un coctail al restaurante ""The Place"" y el camarero fue muy atento y la comida estupenda.

No puedo decir lo mismo del desayuno, parecian todos ir a por faena sin tener en cuenta el trato al cliente, retiraban los platos sin mas, sin sonreir ni nada, como si estuvieran tristes o cansados... 

Tengo que decir que la compañia me tiene totalmente atrapado con su sistema de puntos melia rewards, y estaba especialmente emocionado porque con est reserva cambiabamos de silver a gold tras llegar a los 20.000 puntos, cosa que despues de recibir mis puntos no ha ocurrido...

Siempre que voy a cualquier parte miro primero si hay un Melia para reservar ahí, porque sé que voy a estar bien y se me va a tener en cuenta, pero lo de los puntos deberian revisarlo porque quiero seguir 
yendo a sus hoteles.",4,2015,04,12
28,Mejorable,"Es un buen hotel de 4*, para ser de 5* tendría que mejorar un poco en la renovación de las habitaciones, sobre todo el baño. Tampoco no tendrías que esperar más de una hora en darte tu habitación después de haber hecho el check in.

Por el lado positivo tengo que reconocer que las vistas son estupendas, que la cama es muy confortable y que la habitación es bastante moderna, aunque los baños son mejorables bajo mi punto de vista. También revisar el sistema eléctrico para descorrer las cortinas que tampoco funcionaba.

Repetiría? …no. Calidad-precio hay hoteles de 4* mejores en Barcelona.",3,2015,03,23
28,FENOMENAL!!!,"estuvimos durante el fin de semana en un evento, y sin dudas hemos quedado maravillados con el trato y el buen gusto en el Hotel.
busco y busco por donde pillarles y no encuentro, el servicio al cliente fenomenal, las atenciones, de los trabajadores, pareciera como que te leyeran la mente, cuando le ibas a preguntar ahí estaban ellos con la propuesta, la instalación inmejorable, habitaciones espaciosas, cómodas, y con vistas impresionantes de la ciudad. el servicio de limpieza sin una queja y la comida, excelente así que os recomiendo prueben los exquisitos platos de los Hermanos Torres.
Sin dudas Este Hotel es fenomenal!
enhorabuena por los logros y hacernos sentir tan bien durante nuestra estancia en Barcelona.
Mis colegas y yo estamos encantados!",5,2015,03,16
28,Moderno y elegante. Excelente calidad/precio,"Nos alojamos en la junior suite, una habitación hecha con gusto, moderna y amplia con el el baño muy bien integrado que dispone de un cómodo vestidor. 
El lounge donde puedes picar algo y tomar una copa es muy bonito y acogedor. Tanto la comida como la bebida es de calidad y está presentado de forma elegante.
El hotel en general es muy confortable y moderno con una decoración vanguardista. Quedamos muy contentos de nuestra estancia y la relación calidad/precio es muy buena y esperamos que continue así porque es uno de los principales atractivos que no ofrecen la mayoría de hoteles de la ciudad.",4,2015,02,22
28,Melia Barcelona Sky EXCELENTE!,"Solo hay palabras de EXCELENTE a todos los niveles...atención...calidad...profesionalidad.
Llamé por la mañana para saber si nos podían poner bañera y me dijeron que si, pero cuando llegamos no fue así, llamé para consultar y en diez minutos nos dieron un cambio de habitación superior sin ningún cargo adicional.
Agradecer a Joana toda la atención que nos dio a la hora de esperarnos para servirnos una copa después de la cena. Por traernos el bote de chuches tan deliciosas. Una calidad en cada rincón, empezando desde el personal hasta la gastronomía...todo INCREÍBLE!!!
La única pena que el SPA estaba en reformas, aún así nos derivaron a otro sin ningún coste.
Ya estoy mirando para hacer la próxima escapada...somos de viajar mucho y como este hotel NINGUNO!!
Gracias y hasta pronto!",5,2015,02,17
28,Excellente,"Ya lo dice el refrán, Año nuevo vida nueva y así fue lo que ocurrió en mi ultima estancia el pasado Enero, al llegar al Hotel Meliá Sky de Barcelona.
 
Me hospede en el Hotel por primera vez en sus inicios, cuando respondía al nombre de ME, con el tiempo el aroma, las particularidades que lo hacían especial, fueron desapareciendo poco a poco. Pasando a ser un Hotel que mantenía la calidad que identifica a la cadena Meliá, pero sin aquel ""algo especial"" que a todos los ""enamorados de Me"" tanto nos gustaba.
 
En esta ocasión y con gran sorpresa y satisfacción, encontré de nuevo de forma general, pero en concreto al acceder al The level, para el Chek in, todo aquel ""encanto de Me"" y del que tan buenos recuerdos tengo.
 
Yolanda Grases, Guest Experience Manager, teniendo en cuenta la llegada del cliente, con la amabilidad y atenciones ya habituales en ella, supervisando que todo estuviera como corresponde, me acompaño durante todo el Check in, y que en mi caso fue en The Level, por escoger una de las habitaciones que corresponden a The Level at Meliá Barcelona Sky, con página web propia.
 
Una vez en la habitación, encontre y siendo la misma de siempre, un espacio mas amplio debido a unos cambios de distribucion y para mi exclentes, que la hacian mas amplia incluso mas confortable. Todas las estancias muy cuidadas y con mucho orden.
 
De regreso al The level, para disfrutar de las vistas, a tener en cuenta que la plaza de las Glorias y alrededores actualmente ya estan remodelados, lo que permite disfrutarlas de manera excepcional desde la plata 25 del Hotel y a unos 80 metros de altura. Para mi todo un lujo, acompañado de todo el encanto de este espacio tranquilo, donde Gema y su equipo, procurando que todo este muy cuidado, ofrecen un aperitivo de extensa duracion a lo largo del dia, incluso el desayuno, siendo ambos para mi de mucha calidad y sin desmerecer el del comedor.
 
En cuanto al comedor de la planta baja, donde tuve la ocasión de cenar y por cierto con muy buena atencion en todo momento, con una carta de calidad y muy correcta, tambien tiene un cambio muy positivo, que es la extensión del servicio a terraza, con mucha tranquilidad.
 
Aprovechando la ocasión para agradecer a todo el equipo del Hotel la ilusion y el esfuerzo para que este cambio excelente sea posible, no me despido y os digo Hasta pronto!.",5,2015,02,09
28,"The Level, muy recomendable","Hotel nuevo, bien situado, muy buenas vistas. La junior suite, muy acogedora, con un enorme ventanal y buenas vistas de la ciudad.
Atenciones a media tarde (virutas de chocolate, agua, etc), en la línea habitual de la cadena.
El lavabo desmerecía un poco: los materiales de la encimera quizás sean demasiado  delicados, era lacada en blanco y estaba bastante maltrecha. El espejo de aumento, descolgado. ALgun problema para destapar la bañera... Detalles pequeños que destacan dado que el resto esatba perfecto.
El desayuno todo de buena calidad, pero quizás un poco corto, minimalista. Comparado con otros Meliá, me pareció escaso en cuanto a variedad de platos calientes.
Por lo demás, la atención en el lobby de The Level excelente, con pequeños aperitivos y bebidas incluidas.",5,2015,02,03
28,Experiencia Melia a la altura,"Valorando siempre lo más positivo es de agradecer un hotel con un personal tan profesional y atento para con sus huéspedes, te hacen sentir la mar de cómodo incluso si les haces algún requerimiento.
Desde la reserva (recomiendo el programa de fidelidad Melia) están en contacto para prever tus necesidades antes de tu llegada. En fin un trato exquisito por parte de todo el personal.
Especial agradeciemiento al personal recepción The Level y a la recepción nocturna del Hotel que supieron darnos atención impecable por un inconveniente.
Habitaciones amplias y luminosas con maravillosas vistas, tanto vista ciudad como vista mar.
El servicio de snacks de The Level es correcto, quizás se echa a faltar un poco más de variedad. las bebidas alcohólicas quizás podrían también tener más variedad pero en relación calidad precio va bastante equilibrado.
Muy recomendable la experiencia e invito a que no lo duden y la valoren por si mismos.",5,2015,02,03
28,Defraudados,"Sinceramente, estos hoteles que prometen y luego no cumplen no son propios de la cadena Melia, y mucho menos de un 5 estrellas. Menos aún si contratas un servicio superior:
En los días previos a nuestro viaje, nos llegó un email de una empleada de The Level que prometía hacerse cargo de todo. Habíamos contratado habitación familiar en The Level, y al hacer la reserva nos enviaron un bono con 20 euros diarios de consumo en el hotel, upgrade de habitación, late check out... Las características de la habitación (de la web) incluían experiencia de aromaterapia y según un escrito que nos dan al llegar servicio de descubierta, además de un lounge con snacks durante, prácticamente, todo el día. Así visto, merecía la pena pagar la diferencia de una habitación familiar normal a una habitación The Level.
La persona con la que nos comunicábamos por email nos asegura que queda todo anotado y que no habrá ningún problema. Le envío los bonos por email, tal cual ella me los pide, y me dice que quedan anotados.
Cual es nuestra sorpresa cuando llegamos y los bonos de 20 eruos no están anotados, pero promete anotarlos sin falta (estaba en la recepción, nos recibió, en ese momento exactamente la misma persona con la que había hablado por email). La habitación es normal: la familiar sin el prometido detalle de bienvenida para los niños de la habitación familiar (""amenidades para los niños a la llegada"" según se indica en la pag web), sin upgrade ni explicación al respecto, y por cierto, en el piso mas bajo de las habitaciones familiares normales. De la aromaterapia nada, del servicio de descubierta tampoco, del upgrade tampoco, del late check out nos dicen que el día de la salida vayamos a hablarlo a recepción (a pesar de decirle que necesitaríamos saberlo para organizarnos, pues teníamos un concierto por la mañana el día de la salida), todo con prisa, con ganas de echarnos de la recepción, atropelladamente. Muy educadamente, por supesto, pero quitándosenos de encima.
En fin durante nuestra estancia, de lo prometido nada, todas las promesas incumplidas, pero aún hay más sorpresas: una de las televisiones no funcionaba (cierto es que la arreglaron enseguida), la wii ni catarla y un mando que había allí se lo llevó el técnico de la TV diciendo que ""total no te va a funcionar"", y por si todo esto fuera poco, el día de la salida (que aunque digan que no, si hay alguien en la recepción, como en la recepción The Level solo se atiende de uno en uno toca esperar lo que haga falta), a la hora de hacer el check out NO ESTABAN ANOTADOS todavía los bonos de 20 euros para consumo en el hotel, con el consiguiente ""nos debe usted tanto"", sorpresa y pasar la vergüenza de tener que decirle que tenía dos bonos, no me cobre usted lo que no debe... Además, el rececpionista (este sí mucho más amable que la de la llegada y mucho más dispuesto a ayudar y a resolver) me dice QUE LE TENGO QUE ENVIAR LOS BONOS por email (cosa que, como ya he dicho antes, ya había hecho y se encargaba aquella recepcionista de hacer y anotar) Me explica que le parece increible pues tienen una aplicación para comunicarse y comunicar estas cosas entre empleados para que no ocurra nada. Le explico que de todo lo promentido (detalle de bienvenida, aromaterapia, descubierta, upgrade....) nada de nada y se limita a sonreir y decir que lo siente mucho que no debía haber ocurrido (evidentemente ya no podía hacer nada más que sonreir y disculparse)
Por cierto, el desayuno en The Level es excasísimo, y los snack que promenten durante todo el día... sin más. Indudablemente mejor bajar el restaurante general, es decir, no merece la pena contratar el servicio The Level. Por nada.
En resumen, todo eso de la Experience, de que en The Level no debes preocuparte por nada que buscamos que tengas una experiencia superior... Al menos nosotros... no lo hemos visto.
Es de aquellas ocasiones en las que has pagado para tener un servicio exquisito y cuando te has ido te vas con la sensación de que has pagado por nada. Solemos ir a Meliá, por su habitual excelencia, pero esta experiencia nos ha defraudado bastante. Una pena.",3,2015,02,03
28,Sensazioni contrastanti...difficile giudicare l'insieme,"Difficile valutare l'hotel nel suo insieme. La struttura è bella e imponente situata in luogo ben servito . Avevo la stanza al 22 esimo piano e la vista era spettacolare. Il personale era molto gentile e lo staff è composto da giovani. 
La stanza era pulita, con un design moderno. Il problema è che seppur l'hotel è di recente costruzione si vede che sono stati utilizzati materiali scadenti. In effetti la mancanza di manutenzione si nota, e ci sono molti dettagli rovinati o rotti. Questo porta l'hotel ad essere bello ma di certo non vale 5 stelle. Al the level, ho apprezzato molto il fatto che praticamente durante tutto il giorno al 25esimo piano si poteva usufruire di un servizio di rinfresco e snacks gratuitamente. Anche la colazione era ottima e ben rifornita. Punto negativo é l'attesa per trovare un tavolo un quanto il luogo non ha la capacità di accomodare tutti gli ospiti, SPECIALMENTE quando l'hotel é pieno. Comunque le attese non erano lunghissimo, al Max 5-10 minuti.
Purtroppo la zona Spa e la piscina erano chiuse per ristrutturazione e questo ci era stato riferito al momento della prenotazione. L'hotel mette comunque a disposizione dei buoni per usufruire una Spa convenzionata non lontano dalla'hotel, e se si richiede, la reception rimborsa il trasporto da e per la Spa dei costi del taxi.
Per cui direi che bel complesso è bello, si sta bene, ma non è un cinque stelle. Mancano nei dettagli che farebbero la differenza.
Grazie dell' ospitalità.

28,Bene,"Spettacolare
      
      Davvero molto bravi e gentili per ogni richiesta consiglio a tutti dai coppie a viaggi di affari 
      La metropolitana molto vicina e taxi appena fuori la porta eccellente davvero anche il bar

28,Esperando a la proxima visita!!!,"Ya me he alojado varias veces en este hotel y como siempre genial. Esta vez éramos tres adultos compartiendo habitación y estuvimos super cómodas. La habitación muy buena. Amplia, moderna, limpieza exquisita y las vistas espectaculares. Todo el personal super atento, pedimos unas zapatillas y al segundo ya las teníamos en la habitación. Esta vez, decidimos desayunar en el The Level, si que es verdad que no hay tanta cantidad como en el desayuno normal, pero todo era de primerísima calidad y estaba delicioso. Y poder desayunar con Barcelona a los pies y vistas al Tibidabo, no tiene precio!!!!
Espero volver pronto porque es como sentirse en casa!!!",5,2014,11,09
28,Experiencia Perfecta,"Nos hospedamos en el The Level, en una suite ejecutiva.
La recepción en el The Level, esquisita.
La habitación sorprendente en todos los aspectos, vistas, tamaño, detalles, cama muy comfortable,...
Nos aconsejaron tomar el desayuno en el restaurante del hotel, debido a que es mucho nas completo que en el piso del The Level.
Muy buena atención por parte de todo el personal.
La localicación del hotel no es la mejor, pero en coche estás a 10' de qualquier parte de Barcelona
Sólo añadir como punto negativo el alto precio del parking en el mismo edificio del hotel.

En resumen, muy contento de la estancia en este hotel, para recomendar.",5,2014,11,09
28,deludente altro che 5 stelle,"Hotel non all'altezza delle 5 stelle paragonabile ad un 3 stelle.
Problemi con la rete e la copertura telefonica per chiamare da cellulare.
Sporco, poco luminoso e stanze piccole.
Non lo consiglierei , pessima esperienza!!",1,2014,11,07
28,Ambientacion sofisticada,"Estuve hospedado dos noches y tanto la atención como el servicio fueron acordes a la tarifa del hotel. Me gustó mucho la ambientación general del hotel y la habitación, la cual tenía una fabulosa vista nocturna de la ciudad. Uno de los días opté por desayunar en el Level, y aunque el lounge daba tranquilidad y una excelente vista, prefiero el desayuno en la PB porque es más completo y variado. Utilicé el servicio de alquiler de bicicletas del hotel para recorrer la ciudad y a pesar de ser un poco más caro que en los rentals del lugar, se compensa con la comodidad de retirarla en el hotel, ademas de ser de excelente calidad. En todo momento el personal del hotel se mostró predispuesto a atender mis necesidades.",5,2014,10,26
28,No volveré,"Me aloje en agosto en el level, estuvimos 1 hora ( y no exagero) en realizar el check in y no porque tuvieramos que hacer cola, porque nos atendieron enseguida, sino para acceder a la habitacion. El problema es Tuvimos que bajar ( y subir) 3 veces a la habitacion ( con maletas incluidas ya que nadie se molestó en llevarnoslas)  con unas tarjetas que al final resultaron ser de otra..., creo que al ver la primera vez que no se abria la puerta, podrian haber bajado ellos a ver si funcionaba, pero no, ni si quiera se ofrecieron.... todo esto con el consecuente problema del idioma ( todos los recepcionistas de la planta the level eran extranjeros..). Finalmente decidi ir a quejarme a la recepción del hall, y tambien me atendieron extranjeros que no hablaban ni pizca de español...en fin, lamentable. 

Otro problema, ni siquiera nos ofrecieron el up grade, que ,como cliente del Melia Rewards gold ,en todos los demas hoteles melia que hemos estado ( y son muchos, siempre nos alojamos en melia) si que me lo han ofrecido, es mas, después de todo el circo para entrar me dijeron que si queria una habitacion superior tenia que pagar 45€! Por supuesto les dije muy amablemente que se pusieran la habitacion por....eso si, nos pusieron en la habitacion una botellas de cava ( del barato) como compensación, Mi marido y yo no bebemos alcohol...

Seguimos con la planta del level lounge, sobras del desayuno, y poca cosa mas para picar entre horas.....pero bebidas de marca ( eso esta bien) ilimitadas.

Y ya por acabar, la habitacion era moderna y con unas vistas excelentes, aunque pequeña y la ducha tenia cortina. ( es el primer hotel de 5 estrellas que veo cortina de tela en la ducha), muy cutre la verdad.

En definitiva, si quereis sentiros extranjeros en vuestra propia casa, es vuestro sitio, sino mil veces mejor el Melia barcelona sarria de cuatro estrellas, pero digno de 5.

Es la primera vez que doy una opinión mala de un Melia.",2,2014,09,22
28,"Deludente, forse un 3 stelle","Tutti i commenti negativi giá letti corrispondono esattamente a quanto ho vissuto negli ultimi due giorni. Vedo che ogni commento di risposta dall'hotel é firmato dal ""gusto EXPERIENCE team'. Io credo che in questo albergo (pari a un 3 stelle, e non 5) non si conosca il significato del termine esperienza, cura del cliente né ACCOGLIENZA. 
Ho soggiornato al level ( la parte più 'elité'), il personale é cordiale ma non all'altezza di un 5stelle. La 'reception' é una scrivania dove accolgono un cliente alla volta, il ché significa attendere. Per di più abbiamo firmato stando in piedi in mezzo alla stanza (mai successo neanche in ostello) . Per intenderci all'arrivo non ci hanno accolto spiegando l'orario della colazione né come funzionava il lounge. Hanno pensato solo ad avere i dati della carta di credito (già il loro possesso). Personale con forte odore di sudore. In camera l'odore é asfissiante (una nota floreale molto intensa-le finestre non si aprono per arieggiare) in corridoio l'aroma é delle fogne. Assolutamente non degno di un 5 stelle. Spero che quanto riportato venga preso come spunto per iniziare a capire il termine guest experience.",2,2014,09,15
28,De nuevo hotel expléndido,"Nos hemos alojado para celebrar nuestro 17 aniversario el pásado 17 de Agosto. Es la primera vez que repetimos en todos estos años en un hotel y lo hemos hecho por lo bien que nos trataron el año pasado. Una vez más han vuelto a superarse, a pesar de que ahora ya no es ME, nos recibieron en la recepción del Level y nos permitieron guardar las maletas e irnos a la piscina hasta que la habitación estuviera preparada. Todo lo demás estuvo perfecto: el trato de todo el personal ( en especial Angel, el responsable de la piscina ), el lounge variado y de calidad, el spa, el desayuno, etc.
Es un hotel que destaca sobre los demás en el trato que el personal tiene con los clientes, y lo decimos con seguridad, pues hemos estado en los mejores hoteles de Barcelona, Valencia y Benidorm.
Volveremos con toda seguridad, Gracias por una estancia fantástica",5,2014,08,19
28,Satisfacción justa,"El The Level al Melia debería representar una atención y un detalle varios puntos por encima de la media. En cierta medida lo logra, su precio es algo elevado en comparación con otros hoteles, pero las habitaciones y, en especial, sus vistas, hacen justicia a lo que ofrece este hotel.
Trato bastante amigable y dedicado hacia sus huéspedes aún así, la diferenciación respecto a los niveles inferiores del hotel, no es excesivamente elevada, quizá el incremento de precio debería proporcionar algo más al inquilino.
Con todo ello, sigue siendo muy recomendable para disfrutar de tranquilidad y diferenciación, sobretodo por tener habitaciones amplias y con decoraciones muy conseguidas",4,2014,08,12
28,Una vez más... estancia inolvidable!!!,"Estuvimos hospedados en el servicio The Level de 5* a finales de julio. Como era de esperar, el lounge estaba muy bien, incluso encontré mas variedad en cuanto a bebidas y comidas que antes cuando el hotel era ME. Siempre que viajamos a Barcelona ( la mayoría de veces por las fechas del Open Banc Sabadell Trofeo Conde de Godó) nos hospedamos en el Meliá Sarria por la cercanía al club y por ser el hotel oficial, pero no dudaré en volver a este maravilloso hotel las próximas veces que viajemos a Barcelona. Eché de menos la discoteca Angels de la planta 6, el ambiente era increíble, la piscina genial, con un dj amenizando en un ambiente estupendo. Hotel cerca de la playa Fórum, donde se celebro el Barcelona Beach Festival.  En cuanto a la habitación, he de decir que el tamaño no hacia honor a su nombre ""Grand Premium"" pues creo que la habitación es de las más standars del hotel, por lo demás, habitación muy moderna, limpia y con una camada comodísima.  Intenté que nos hicieran upgrade a SJS ya que llevaba los bonos correspondientes y al ser del Club Meliá Platinum normalmente nos lo hacen sin pedirlo, pero al estar al 100% el hotel no pudo hacerlo. DESTACAR la profesionalidad, amabilidad, buen trato de MARTA del Level, mil gracias por tu simpatía, tu sonrisa y por hacernos la estancia tan agradable... creo que gente como ella, hace que merezca la pena volver al hotel pues te hace sentir como en casa,  por supuesto, mencionar y agradecer también a Simeone por su amabilidad y a Litz (Guest Experience) por ofrecernos una gran variedad de clubs y hacernos pasar una noche increíble, mil gracias a todos ellos. Por último darle mi mas sincera enhorabuena al Director Alfredo Aznar por la excelente gestión de estos dos pedazos de hoteles.
Nos vemos muy pronto!! 
Miguel Mompeán.",5,2014,08,12
28,Carino,"Il livello è abbastanza buono. Il check in molto veloce in una saletta dove puoi prendere da bere dalle 6 fino alle 23. La stanza era al 20* piano con grandi vetrate l'unico neo  la mancanza di pulizia tornavo e trovavo polvere ovunque. La colazione era abbondante però sotto nel ristorante principale. Nel complesso il soggiorno è stato discreto.

28,Recomendable. ...PERO.....,"Desde la reserva...... ley de Murphy
Envían factura que no corresponde
La atención del Level.....mejor en planta baja
A la media hora. Nos llaman ya que se les había olvidado solicitarme los datos tarjeta. 
Recibo unos cargos 《bloqueo》que tuve que pedir explicaciones.
Para desyuno hacer cola, no creo que sea el ideal para un hotel de categoría. 
Vaya hoy el spa no está operativo y ayer piscina cerrada por evento.
Solicite posibilidad de cena en dos cielos...aun espero respuesta.

En fin MURPHY sin vacaciones. 

La ubicación tranquila. La habitación correcta y limpia y las vistas son espectaculares. 

Aún con Murphy volveré.  Saludos un pro/melia",3,2014,07,23
28,Muy recomendable,"Conocí el hotel por cuestión de trabajo hace meses y me dije que por capricho volvería un par de días de escapada a Barcelona. Elegí el servicio del 5*, ya que quería conocer lo que había en la 25. Perfecto el lounge, con un aperitivo diferente en función de la hora del día. el hotel es moderno, funcional y las vistas son espectaculares desde aquí. El personal encantador, especialmente Simone, que da gusto encontrar gente tan amable y servicial hoy en día !!! ",5,2014,07,16
28,Relax Total,"Hotel un pelín alejado del centro pero cercano a la playa lo cual era mas importante para mí que la centricidad ya que conozco muy bien Barcelona y el motivo de mi viaje ha sido para desconectar unos dias con amigos.
La atención del personal, en especial Yolanda de ""Experience"" y Verónica del Level ha sido exquisita. El chillout de la piscina maravilloso y preparan muy buenos mojitos, ademas, por las tardes tienen a un DJ que pincha muy buena musica chillout.
El desayuno de la planta baja delicioso y con mucha variedad de alimentos.
Las habitaciones un poco pequeñas pero limpias y muy comodas, la cama te invita a no salir de ella por la mañana.
A 5 minutos a pie esta el metro que te deja en 10 minutos en el centro de la ciudad y a 4 calles del hotel hay una rambla peatonal que no es la famosa rambla del centro pero que tambien tiene mucha vidilla y distintos tipos de comercios y restaurantes.",5,2014,07,12
28,Vacaciones de verano,"Fantastico hotel para pasar las vacaciones de verano... A solo 10 minutos a pie de la playa de Bogatell que es la mas chula de Barcelona y con una piscina exterior muy ""Cool"", con DJ pinchando por la tarde creando un ambiente veraniego estupendo. Tambien he visitado el spa para hacer un circuito de aguas... probadlo... os encantara.. yo al terminar fui a la habitación y ya no quise salir de lo relajado que me quede... Las habitaciones muy modernas y de diseño con vistas inigualables de Barcelona... lo mejor es el lounge de la planta 25 con un servicio muy correcto y con tapas y copas incluidas en la reserva durante todo el día. Yo me he alojado 5 dias aquí y seguro que volvere el proximo año de hecho tengo familiares que visitaran proximamente Barcelona y les he dicho de cambiar su hotel por el The Level que se les gustará mucho mas.",5,2014,07,12
28,"Spektakuläre Aussicht, toller Service und größter Komfort","Da wir das erste Mal als Familie und nicht zu zweit nach Barcelona gereist sind, haben wir uns für das The Level entschieden. Nach Kleinigkeiten die uns nicht gefielen, wurde uns großzügig eine Suite zur Verfügung gestellt. Der Service ist bemerkenswert und die vielen Kleinigkeiten in der oberen Lobby speziell für The Level Gäste ist wirklich gut gemacht. Angefangen vom Frühstück über den Mittag, frühen Nachmittag, Kaffee-Zeit und am Abend, immer ist etwas für die Gäste vorbereitet oder in Arbeit. Es ist alles was man eventuell benötigt im Hotel vorhanden. Der Weg zum Strand mit Kind ist nah und dauert circa 15 Minuten zu Fuß. Aber auch die Pool-Anlage ist sehr schön angelegt. Das hervorragende Restaurant Dos Ciellos ist definitiv einen Besuch wert (auch mit Kind wenn es sich denn benehmen kann). Allein wie mann sich auch hier rücksichtsvoll um uns und unsere Tochter bemüht hat ist klasse. Die Suite war top ausgestattet und lies keine Wünsche offen. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Jederzeit wieder als Melia Rewards Mitglied, auch wenn wir sonst eher zu kleineren Hotels tendieren.",4,2014,07,07
28,Calidad y Servicio Excelente,"Fuimos a celebrar nuestro 5to Aniversario de matrimonio, conocimos el hotel porque les regalamos la noche de boda a unos amigos y les pareció excelente y decidimos celebrar nuestro aniversario aquí.

Nos sorprendió la forma de recibirnos, ya que no sabíamos que haríamos el check in en la planta ""The level"" donde nos atendieron fenomenal, Nos acompañó Yolanda una chica muy simpática que nos comentó todos los servicios del hotel y se puso a nuestra disposición por si necesitábamos algo o si teníamos algún problema.

Las vistas tanto de la planta ""The level"" como de la habitación que estaba en la planta 22 eran espectaculares, tuvimos las dos perspectivas de Barcelona, vistas a la ciudad y vistas al mar, algo distante pero impresionantes igualmente.

La habitación expectacular, moderno, limpio y lo más importante muy cómoda. Genial idea de diseño de que puedes ver las vistas al mar desde el espejo del baño, no te pierdes las vistas en ningun momento. Pude realizar varias fotos de la ciudad sin problemas

La habitación disponia de una barra de sonido con conexion usb y pudimos colocar nuestra música y estar a gusto en la habitación. Mi esposa habia pedido un pack con petalos de rosas y el hotel nos regaló una botella de cava por nuestro aniversario.

El SPA no estaba acorde al resto de servicios del hotel, el Jacuzzi no funcionaba y al consultarlo no tuvimos una solución al momento, las placas del suelo de la ducha vi térmica están poco sujetas y se mueven… pueden ser peligrosas. Creo que podría hacerse mantenimiento y una puesta a punto para que no desencaje con el resto del hotel.
En la noche del sábado había un DJ en la recepción con música Lounge lo cual invitaba a tomar un cocktail y quedarse un rato, música excelente y un DJ muy profesional. La decoración es espectacular.

Los servicios del Lounge del hotel ""The level"" variados, los sillones y sofás cómodos y buena variedad de licores.

La verdad una experiencia diferente, un agradecimiento a todo el equipo del hotel.",5,2014,07,06
28,Mi hogar en barcelona,"Soy una cliente asidua al The Level ya que por negocios viajo constantemente a barcelona y siempre me alojo en este hotel... La elección fue por parte de mi compañía pero han acertado totalemente.

Todos los miembros del equipo siempre estan dispuestos a ayudarte con su mejor sonrisa, a mi me conocen muy bien ya que hace practicamente un año que los visito al menos una vez al mes y siempre me reconocen al llegar y tienen todo listo según mis preferencias.

El lounge de la planta 25 es el mejor lugar para relajarse y disfrutar despues de un largo dis de trabajo.

Las habitaciones son muy modernas y funcionales con fantasticas vistas a la ciudad o al mar, según mi experiencia os recomiendo las vistas mas ya que son mas amplias y tienen bañera pero las mejores vistas son a la ciudad ya que puedes ver a la Torre Agbar, la Sagrada Familia y hasta el Tibidabo.

El desayuno es fantástico con una amplia variedad de alimentos de muy buena calidad.

Tal vez el único pero sería la ubicación aunque a mi me va de maravilla por la cercanía con mi empresa pero talvez si vienes de vacaciones a visitar la ciudad te quede un poco lejos pero esta bien comunicado por metro y en 10 minutos como mucho estas en el centro de la ciudad.

Recomiendo muicho este hotel para todos los viajeros.",5,2014,06,24
28,Decisamente deludente,"Il peggior cinque stelle in cui sono mai stato. Salvo unicamente la bellissima vista dalle stanze, sia quelle lato mare sia quelle lato città. Per il resto da bocciare (rispetto alle mie aspettative per un cinque stelle):
- la doccia non solo senza vetro, ma senza nemmeno una misera tendina di plastica, e senza nemmeno il soffione a parete. In pratica occorreva tenere in mano la doccetta per lavarsi, una vera miseria, basterebbe pochissimo per sistemare,
- aria viziata dalla mancanza di finestre apribili. Nel corridoio l'aria e' davvero insopportabile.
- non mi hanno cambiato gli asciugamani sporchi solo perché li ho lasciati sul lavandino anziché, come ho letto purtroppo solo dopo in un fogliettino volante, averli messi nella vasca da bagno,
- mini bottiglietta d'acqua offerta solo la prima sera,
- mancanza di un poggia valigie
E non ricordo altro, ma questo direi che può bastare.
Dimenticavo, di positivo per gli ospiti del The Level c'è la lounge, con qualche bevanda e spuntini offerti, ma chiude alle 23.00.
Come si è forse capito, un'esperienza che non mi è piaciuta per nulla.
Se però vi interessa solo la vista, e non vi interessano i difetti che ho scritto sopra, andateci pure.",2,2014,06,09
28,Aniversario inolvidable,"Conocimos este hotel regalándole la noche de bodas a unos amigos que lo pasaron increíble y decidimos conocerlo personalmente celebrando nuestro 5to aniversario de matrimonio. Desde el momento que llegamos nos quedamos sorprendidos con el recibimiento, que no sabíamos que íbamos a tener un check in privado en la planta 24 y más aún acompañados por la simpática Yolanda que en todo momento tuvo una atención impecable y nos informó de todos los servicios del hotel y lo que teníamos incluido. Siempre dispuesta a cualquier petición.

La habitación increíble!! Nos dieron upgrade a una Junior Suite en la planta 22. Las vistas espactaculares y además mi esposo es amateur de la fotografía profesional, así que fue mucho más de lo esperado. Una ventana tenía unas manchas en el interior, pero enseguida vinieron a limpiarlas (para las fotos claro). La decoración también excelente ya que solicité pétalos y velas. Por nuestro aniversario nos pusieron cava y fresas que ha hecho de nuestra celebración mucho más especial.

El lounge The Level genial y muy variado, con muy buen ambiente. Tuvimos oportunidad de disfrutar del Bar del Lobby por la noche donde había un DJ con muy buena música y muy profesional. El personal del bar también atento.

El desayuno buffet muy bueno también y la distribución de las mesas está muy bien diseñada y no hay agobio aunque haya mucha gente.

El único detalle a mejorar es el Spa, que en el circuito de aguas no funcionaba el lado del jacuzzi y no nos ofrecieron ninguna solución estando allí. Aparte vi un poco peligroso que las lozas del suelo de la ducha bitérmica están flojas e inestables. En general se ve descuidado, creo que si le hacen mejor mantenimiento, ya estuviera más acorde con el resto de las instalaciones. 

Por último, tuvimos un late check out que hemos valorado muchísimo y hemos dejado la habitación sin prisas, aparte de disfrutarla al máximo.

Agradecemos todo el equipo de Guest Experience por habernos mimado y complacido hasta más de lo esperado. Sin duda volveremos al Meliá Sky.",5,2014,05,29
28,Un detalle definitivo,"Gran decoración. Cómodo, aunque un poco apartado. Formidable desayuno. Muy correcto. Pero el detalle definitivo fue cuando, al ir a recoger la maleta que había dejado, me ofrecieron cambiarme de ropa y ducharme en el gimnasio. Formidable.",4,2014,05,16
28,Maravillosa experiencia,"Mi experiencia en este hotel fué maravillosa, desde el momento que nos recibieron el el Lounge de la planta 25 nuestra estancia se convirtió en un sin fin de detalles que hacen que uno se sienta como si fuera el único cliente del Hotel. Las vistas desde la habitación fantásticas! El diseño del hotel moderno y con mucho gusto decorado. Nos aconsejaron lugares cercanos para salir a cenar muy buenos, uno de ellos donde comimos de maravilla está a 5 minutos del hotel "" La Forquilla"" es verdad que el hotel no se encuentra en pleno centro pero el barrio tiene un encanto especial y además si quieres puedes llegar a la plaza Cataluña en 10 minutos con metro. La verdad es que lo pasamos genial y estamos deseando volver a escaparnos pronto.
Gracias a Alejandra, Simone y los chicos de recepción que no recuerdo sus nombres por una estancia cálida y llena de buenos recuerdos.",5,2014,05,12
28,El mejor servicio de Barcelona,"Viajo constantemente a Barcelona por la familia y amigos y siempre voy visitando distintos hoteles para ir conociendo y aunque no tenía grandes expectativas sobre el The Level esto ha hecho que mi visita haya sido mucho mejor ya que realmente me sorprendió positivamente... el lounge de la planta 25 es espectacular, la variedad de tapas y bebidas que ofrecen son buenísimos... las vistas a Barcelona únicas pero lo mejor el servicio del personal, en especial Simone y Albert quienes han estado al pendiente de mi y de mis amigos en todo momento.
Las habitaciones muy limpias y amplias, de diseño y nuevamente con vistas espectaculares al mar. El desayuno buffet es mejor el de la planta baja que el del lounge pero los dos están incluidos así que pudimos probar los dos... la piscina es fantástica sobretodo cuando hace buen tiempo ya que a nosotros solo nos hizo buen día una mañana pero me hubiera encantado poder aprovecharla mas. Sin duda volveré en mi próxima visita a Barcelona y lo recomiendo a todos los viajeros.",5,2014,05,12
28,Muy recomendable...,"He vuelto de una escapada romántica con mi pareja en Barcelona y he de decir que este hotel ha sido lo mejor de nuestro viaje... el servicio de todo el equipo es muy atento, las habitaciones amplias, limpias, acogedoras y con unas vistas impresionantes. El lounge de la planta 25 que también tiene unas vistas únicas a la ciudad ofrece todo tipo de bebidas y tapas durante todo el día y están incluidas en el precio. Tienen una piscina en la planta 6 en donde puedes tomar el sol y una copa mientras escuchas una selección de música chill out buenísima. Sin duda Barcelona es única pero alojarse en este hotel hace que no te quieras marchar de ella nunca...",5,2014,05,11
28,Perfecto para business travel,"Personalmente quedé muy satisfecho con la reunión de tres jornadas que organicé en The Level at Melia Sky. El de Level Lounge es, en mi opinión, magnífico para entender el concepto ""exclusividad"". Nuestro ""meeting"" tuvo lugar en The Level Meeting Room, una sala con vistas increibles a Barcelona desde la planta 25, perfecta para reuniones pequeñas. Genial trato e implicación de todo el equipo de eventos. 
Os recomiendo las executive junior suite, levantarte con esas vistas al mar ¡no tiene precio! Y qué decir de Dos Cielos...la fama que se han ganado estos chicos (Javier y Sergio Torres) es más que merecida. 
En conclusión, soy de los que pienso que entre hacer las cosas bien y mal, la diferencia es la actitud, y lo que vi, es pasión...",5,2014,05,03
28,Leider nicht so gut wie im Vorjahr!,"Nachdem wir im Vorjahr mit diesem Hotel sehr zufrieden waren
muß ich leider sagen, dass es in diesem Jahr so Einiges zu bemängeln gab.

Beim Bezug des Zimmers waren doch so einige Verschleißerscheinungen zu erkennen. Im Bad ließ sich in der Dusche die Bedinung nicht von Regendusche auf Handdusche umstellen und es
war auch nur mäßig gereinigt.
Im Zimmer selber standen noch benutzte Gläser vom Vorgänger, die selbst nach der 3. Nacht nicht ausgetauscht wurden.
Es war mangelhaft Staubgewischt.

In der Lounge wurde so gut wie nie Snacks angeboten. Wir waren an 4 Tagen zu den unterschiedlichsten Zeiten dort und auch die anderen Gäste waren höchst unzufrieden mit dem angebotenen Service.

Lobend möchte ich jedoch erwähnen, dass das Frühstücksbuffet immer noch sehr umfangreich und qualitativ hochwertig ist.

Wie gesagt im Vorjahr waren diese kritisierten Punkte alle nicht vorhanden und ich hoffe sehr, dass das Hotel wieder den gewohnten Standard herstellen kann.",2,2014,04,26
28,Una pequeña decepción,"Cuando realizas una reserva en servicio superior ""The Level"", lo que deseas es eso, tener unas atenciones especiales y sentirte especial. Para recibir una atención estándar, realizas una reserva normal.

El cheking privado y personalizado se convierte en un trámite largo e interminable, siendo más rápido y eficiente el de la recepción normal.
El set de amenities no es diferente al del resto de habitaciones. 
El SPA necesita una renovación. No es de recibo que esté en mantenimiento durante las fechas de más ocupación del año.

Lo mejor, la atención de todos y cada uno de los empleados. 
El buffet del desayuno sigue estando a la altura de un hotel de 5*, así como el restaurante The Place.

Volveremos, pero no al servicio de The Level. No merece la pena pagar más por él.",3,2014,04,24
28,Gutes Hotel in Barcelona,"Leider ist das ""Level"" im Melia nicht ganz billig. Mit Mitgliedschaft bei Melia Rewards, und entsprechender Online Anmeldung für dieses System kann man aber einiges an Preisreduktion herausholen. Hier lohnt es sich vor der Buchung auch aktiv in Google nach zusätzlichen Rabattcodes zu suchen. 
Die Junior Suite Executive ist sehr gross und verfügt über eine tolle Aussicht zum Mittelmeer hin. Das Zimmer ist auch schön und die Annehmlichkeiten des ""Level"" (wie z.B. den ganzen Aufenthalt über kostenfreie Getränke, alkoholisch und nicht alkoholisch auf der 25. Etage) sind nicht zu unterschätzen. Allerdings wirken die Zimmer bereits etwas ""abgenutzt"" und weitere Mängel sind die TV's (bei denen kein einziger Sender ging...) und die laute Klimaanlage. Das Frühstück im Erdgeschoss ist umfangreich und schmeckt gut. Leider gibt es nur Kaffee oder Tee und leider kein Cappucino. Auch mussten wir jeden Morgen zuerst einige Minuten warten um einen freien Tisch zu bekommen. Check-in konnten wir gleich um ca. 13.00 Uhr machen, obschon eigentlich erst ab 15.00 Uhr vorgesehen. Allerdings fragt sich hier der Sinn des Extra-Desks in der 25. Etage. Da hier jeweils lediglich immer nur ein Mitarbeiter die Reception bedient, sind die Wartezeiten länger als wenn man gleich unten in der regulären Reception einchecken könnte. Auch müssen wir noch anmerken, dass eine vorgängige E-Mail Anfrage von uns über mehrere Tage unbeantwortet blieb.
Alles in allem können wir das Hotel empfehlen, wenn man nicht wirklich allererste 5-Sterne-Qualität erwartet.",4,2014,04,21
28,Mala Experiencia,"Estuve en tres habitaciones distintas en 2 noches, una no tenía WIFI, la otra 2 camas juntas que hacían una doble por lo que no se podía dormir y la tercera el baño estaba en muy malas condiciones.
El hotel además está lejos del centro.",2,2014,03,21
28,Le falta una capa de pintura,"Nosotros fuimos hace unos 2 o 3 años antes de que dividieran el hotel en 4 y la superior en 5 estrellas y la verdad que bien. Está vez fuimos a la zona de 5 estrellas y nos dieron la habitación 2309  y justo da debajo del restaurante 2 cielos y toda la noche fue como si los vecinos de arriba se mudaran.
Las paredes con rascones y marcas de maletas. ya no son blancas, el baño desconchado en algunos sitios y la pintura del techo muy manchada. Por ser un 5 estrellas les falta higiene. La gobernanta un poco dejada. La nevera por dentro jamás la limpiaron. Estaba muy sucia.
La alfombra del salón falto de aspirador.
La acogida en recepción muy buena. E leido por aquí que en la recepción que tiene una barra con comida y bebida es barra libre todo el día si és así no nos dijeron nada.
El desayuno nos recomendaron que bajáramos mejor al restaurante de abajo el Me por estar más surtido. La verdad que está mejor surtido que hace un par de años, per és mejorable. La bollería eran donuts normales y de chocolate, unos crusanes y un par de tartas compradas. Embutidos tipo cabeza de jabalí, mortadela y algo de jamón. En caliente huevos y bacon, algún sanguich, zumos y fruta (solo estaba buena la piña el resto verde) En hoteles de 3 estrellas e visto mejores desayunos.  Para ser un 5 estrellas muy poco cuidado.
La cama nada del otro mundo, los cojines están bien.
El aire acondicionado de la habitación super ruidoso. Yo tengo aire por el techo en casa en las 2 plantas y solo hace ruido la máquina que está en el baño y poco el del hotel ruidoso loapague por la noche.
Lo mejor las 2 televisiones de la suit y su mega mando a distancia.
Os pongo fotos.",3,2014,03,18
28,Digno de recomendar...,"Aunque soy un lector recurrente de trip advisor nunca habia escrito ninguna opinion prpia sobre un hotel hasta que fui al The Level en Barcelona.
Antes estuve leyendo las opiniones de otros viajeros y la verdad es que estoy totalmente de acuerdo con ellos. El hotel es muy bueno y digno de recomendar por su buen servicio, instalaciones limpias, funiconales y comfortables para cualquier viajero aunque el motivo de mi vaije era de neghocios pero vi la piscina que tienen, el spa y sobretodo el lounge de la planta 25 en el cual te sientes muy acogido y bien atendido por los ""level concierges"". Sin duda cuando visiten Barcelona este es un lugar que te hara sentir ""como en casa"" como he leido en otra opinion. Seguro habra mejores hoteles en Barcelona y tambien mucho peores sin duda pero este es un hotel fantastico. Pedir habitaciones en  plantas altas para gozar de las vistas.",5,2014,03,15
28,¡Todo un lujo!,"Recientemente me he alojado en este hotel de Barcelona por un viaje de negocios y aunque no conozco otros, la verdad es que he quedado muy contento con el servicio y la acogida que me han dado, sobretodo en el piso 25 que es la zona VIP del hotel y que goza de un salón privado en el que puedes degustar alimentos y bebidas durante todo el dia gozando de fantásticas vistas, además los conserjes son muy serviciales. Las habitaciones, al menos la mia ha sido muy linda, cómoda y limpia y tienes vistas a la ciudad incluso desde la ducha. 
El hotel s encuentra muy cerca del CCIB que es el centro de congresos de Barcelona y cerca de varias oficinas de empresas a las que tuve que visitar por lo que me resulto muy conveniente y como turista no esta muy céntrico pero esta muy bien conectado por el subterraneo. Seguro que volveré a hospedarme aquí si tengo la oportunidad de volver a Barcelona.
No se si es muy caro ya que todo me lo ha pagado la compañía pero sin duda el servicio es de gran lujo.",5,2014,03,11
28,Buenisimo!!,"Me gustaria recomendar este hotel a todas las personas que visiten Barcelona... el trato al cliente es buenisimo y el hotel es relindo... las habitaciones con vistas impresionantes, muy lipias y comodas y auqnue yo lo he visitado en invierno el hotel esta muy cerca de las playas de Barcelona y ademas tiene una piscina con vistas al mar por lo que en verano debe ser aun mejor. El desayuno es espectacular y riquisimo. Lo recomiendo a todos.",5,2014,03,10
28,Mejor que en casa...,"El mejor hotel en el que me he alojado en Barcelona, sin duda la diferencia es el equipo que tienen aunque las instalaciones son fantasticas tambien... El lounge de la planta 25 es como estar en el salon de casa, tienes comida y bebidas de todo tipo a tu disposicion durante todo el dia y todo esta incluido en la tarifa de la reserva. Los recepcionistas son muy simpaticos y siempre dispuestos a ayudarte en todo lo que necesites. Las habitaciones con unas vistas inmejorables de Barcelona con diseño unico, limpias y comodas. El desayuno con una gran variedad de alimentos y todo delicioso. La ubicacion aunque no es centrica esta muy bien conectada por bus y el subterraneo a todas partes, ademas siempre hay taxis disponibles las 24hs justo en la esquina del hotel. 
No duden en escoger este hotel y pedir por la parte del ""Level"" en su reserva si teneis pensado visitar Barcelona.",5,2014,03,07
28,Recomedable,"Muy buen hotel ubicado en las afueras del centro de Barcelona pero al mismo tiempo en una zona residencial muy bonita y con acceso muy facil al centro... para mi ha sido muy bueno ya que no me gusta hospedarme donde esta todo el tumulto de gente mas que nada por que viajo de negocios... los cuartos son muy bonitos, limpios y con unas vistas impresionantes de barcelona... lo mejorcito es el lounge de la planta 25 en el que tienes comida y bebida durante todo el d{ia, incluyendo bebidas alcoholicas y todo esta incluido en tu reserva. La gente muy amable, no como en el resto de Barcelona en donde desde mi punto de vista la gente esta todo el tiempo de mal humor. Lo recomiendo mucho a todas las personas que por trabajo tienen que visitar Barcelona.",5,2014,03,02
28,Enamorado...,"Solo comentar que he vuelto de mi viaje por España enamorado de este pais pero sin duda lo mejor ha sido Barcelona y el Hotel Melia Sky ha sido en gran parte el causante de este estado... nunca me habia sentido tan apapachado y consentido con tanto detalle y atencion que han puesto en mi hospedaje... Quiero felicitar a Simone y David que me han atendido como nunca... la verdad es que no suelo ir a hoteles de 5 estrellas pero al ser la ultima etapa de mi recorrido decidi consentirme un poco y no me arrepiento... el servicio es inigualable... el lounge The Level es unico, con bebidas y comida incluidas en la tarifa de alojamiento durante el todo el dia y al volver cada dia de hacer turismo por la ciudad siempre me recibian con una sonrisa y una conversacion agradable... las habitaciones son muy bonitas y con unas vistas fabulosas al mar y a la ciudad, todo muy limpio y cuidado... la cama ha sido la mejor en la que he dormido en mi vida... hay un spa en el que por ser cliente level tienes acceso gratis al jacuzzi, y al sauna... que despues de caminar por toda la ciudad siempre te recomforta... el desayuno muy bueno y variado y tuve la oportunidad de cenar un dia en room service y debo decir que tambien me he quedado muy satisfecho ya que normalemnte la comida de room service es horrible pero he pedido una hamburguesa que estuvo mejor que en muchos restaurantes...
Os recomeindo a todos viajar a España y en especial a Barcelona y sin duda el hotel donde hospedarse en esta bella ciudad es el Melia Sky, no se arrepentiran de verdad...",5,2014,03,01
28,Escapada romántica en Barcelona!!,"Acabo de volver de un fin de semana en Barcelona con mi pareja... era una sorpresa para ella y todo ha salido genial!!, desde la llegada al The Level, Yolanda, la recepcionista nos dió una fantastica bienvenida con cava mientras disfrutabamos de las fabulosas vistas a la ciudad desde la planta 25 del hotel. Al subir a la habitación otra sorpresa mas... teniamos toda la habitación decorada con pétalos, mas cava y unas fresas bañadas en chocolate pero lo mas cuco fue un mensajito que pusieron en el espejo deseandonos un feliz aniversario y el cual no nos esperabamos ya que yo si que habia pedido la decoración con petalos pero el mensajito fue un toque especial junto con el cava y las fresas que tampoco había pedido... la habitación es muy amplia y comoda (yo reserve una junior suite), las vistas fabulosas, estabamos en la planta 28... la cama ha sido una de las mejores en las que hemos dormido... el desayuno exquisito y el spa muy relajante... ademas hemos cenado en el restaurante Do2 en la planta baja y la comida y la presentación de los platillos al igual que el servicio por parte de Lorenzo y Alberto ha sido fabuloso pero ya pondré un comentario mas amplio al respecto en su tripadvisor... en fin, resumiendo ha sido una escapada inolvidable y única, sin duda muy recomendable para parejas que buscan salir de la rutina en un día especial... lo recomiendo ampliamente... Enhorabuena a Yolanda y a todo el equipo del level que nos han cuidado muchisimo de principio a fin...",5,2014,02,10
28,"Fin de semana, espectacular !!!!","Nosotros nos alojamos este fin de semana en este hotel, nada mas llegar la recepción de Iolanda fue perfecta, en todo momento estubieron pendientes por si nos faltava alguna cosita.
Al llegar a la habitación que pedimos vista ciudad y nos dierosn vista mar, era espectacular, unas vistas increibles i la habitacion perfecta, con todos los detalles.
Tambien estuvimos a la zona Yhi que tambien era muy acogedor, a parte de esto nos hicieron una massage de 50 minutos a los dos, fantastico, salimos super relajados.
El detalle que mas nos sorprendio, es que por la noche al llegar a la habitación, encontramos fresas con chocolate y cava, fue una sorpresa especial y estamos muy agradecidos por ello.
El desayuno tambien perfecto.
Que decir mas, todo fue perfecto y sin dudarlo puedo confirmar que repetiremos en otra ocasión.
Lo recomendamos cien por cien, no se arepentiran.
Para terminar dar las gracias a todo el personal por como nos trataron y lo bien que nos hicieron sentir.
Saludos,
Esther",5,2014,02,10
28,Como en casa...,"Acabamos de volver de un viaje con amigos por Barcelona y es una ciudad fantastica pero sin duda lo mejor ha sido volver al The Level despues de largos dias de paseo por la ciudad... pero para empezar debo decir que tan solo llegar al hotel, te acompanan a la planta 25 en donde haces el check in en privado, en cuantos e abren las puertas del ascensor ya te quedas sin aliento con las fabulosas vistas, mientras te registras te ofrecen cava y tapas las cuales estan incluidas en el precio de la reserva al igual que el buffet que tienen a lo largo del dia en donde puedes disfrutar de diferentes tapas duarnte el dia, y todas las bebidas que puedas imaginar, desde cafe y te hasta cava, vinos, y cocteles... tambien tienes incluido el acceso al spa, al gym y el planchado de una prenda diaria... definitivamente vale la pena pagar un poco mas para tener todos estos beneficios... la habitaci'on es chulisima y tambien con vistas alucinantes a la ciudad, veiamos la sagrada familia sin salir de la cama y mientras te duchas tambien ya que en vez de tener una pared dividiendo el lavabo de la habitaci'on tienen un cristal que te permite ver las vistas desde donde estes...
Volviendo al principio, lo mejor sin duda es el servicio, cada dia Yolanda, Alejandra y Sergio nos mimaban con sus atenciones personalizadas, sabian que era el cumplea;os de uno de nuestros amigos y le han enviado a la habitaci'on una botella de cava con fresas y chocolates... detallazo!!!
La ubicacion del hotel esta apartado del centro lo cual para mi ha sido mucho mejor que estar donde esta todo el alboroto y esta muy bien comunicado, el metro esta a 5 min. caminando y en 10 minutos estas en Plaza catalunya.
Quiero agradecere a los chicos del level por sus atenciones y deciros que sin duda pronto volveremos... lo recomiendo a todos los que esten planeando un viaje a Barcelona.",5,2014,02,09
28,experiencia inolvidable,"La primera vez que me alojo en este hotel de una ubicación excelente cerca del centro comercial Glorias y con parada de taxi en frente del hotel y estaciones de metro cerca. El personal del hotel un 10 para el trato que te dan, un hotel con buen estilo, buena comida donde repetiría sin duda. Mi estancia fue en The Level donde he recibido un trato personalizado, excelente trato, un ambiente agradable. En la habitación he podido disfrutar de unas vistas de la ciudad Barcelona impresionantes y estilo esquicito dentro de la habitación.
Volvería por supuesto.AndreeaR",5,2014,02,08
28,"Una vez mas, sin palabras!","Es la segunda vez que me alojo en el The Level en el Melia Barcelona Sky, y como ya es de costumbre consiguieron dejarnos sin palabras. El personal excelente y la habitación espectacular!!! Una junior suite con unas vistas fabulosas al mar!! El desayuno de gran calidad y esperamos poder disfrutar del spa la próxima vez que vayamos. Gracias por hacer de esta estancia una estancia espectacular!! Sin duda repetiremos!",5,2014,02,04
28,Bello ma scarso nella gestione complessiva ,"Stanza con vista sul mare (potenzialmente splendida se i vetri della stanza fossero stati puliti da riuscire a vedere fuori).
Stanza pulita, ben arredata e gestita con comandi domotici per accensione/spegnimento luci e apertura/chiusura tende. 
Note negative: la doccia si chiudeva con una semplice tendina di plastica ( evidente mal riuscita soluzione tampone per rimpiazzare una porta in vetro la cui esistenza si denotava da guide a pavimento). Inoltre la stanza, non avendo finestre apribili per questioni di architettura simil grattacielo, non era ben climatizzata e manteneva una temperatura di 27 grandi in pieno inverno. Abbiamo provato a spiegare la problematica in reception segnalando la mancanza d'aria e l'elevata temperatura ma il problema non è stato risolto, infatti tenendo accesa l'aria condizionata a 18 gradi, la stanza non andava mai sotto i 27, rendendo l'ambiente asfissiante.
SPA piccola e mal funzionante (le docce per accedere a bagno turco e sauna erano guaste).
Tasto dolente: per fare colazione bisognava mettersi in lista d'attesa per circa 15 minuti ed una mattina ci hanno detto che non era più possibile sedersi perché avevano tutti i tavoli pieni e smaltendo la lista d'attesa sarebbero andati oltre l'orario previsto. Quindi ci hanno mandato via.
Il personale è molto gentile e disponibile e il cibo è di buona qualità.
A nostro avviso l'hotel non è all'altezza di un 5 stelle.

",3,2014,01,18
28,excelente estancia,"Mi hija nos regaló a mi marido a mi una noche en el The Level del Melià Barcelona Sky. Desde el primer momento que llegamos, nos sentimos como en casa. El check in lo hicimos en la planta 25, donde el personal nos atendió de una forma exquisita, igual que en el check out. Cuando entramos en la habitación nos quedamos sin palabras, era espectacular!!La Junior Suite era enorme, muy cuidada, tanto de limpieza como de mantenimiento, y la cama comodísima. Los amenities de la Tous, un gran acierto. 
No hay duda que en cuanto podamos volveremos.",5,2014,01,15
28,Excelente Fiesta de Fin de Año 2013,"En una excelente ambientación de la Sala de la 4a Planta del Melia Sky, celebramos una fiesta de fin de año, que tardaremos en olvidar por lo bien que desarrollo toda la cena.
Hubo gran motivación de hacer pasar una velada divertida, animada, elegante y predispuesta para el baile, por parte de todo el equipo del hotel.

Las mesas estuvieron perfectamente decoradas, la cena servida al ritmo adecuado, todos los platos magníficamente cocinados, y para después de las uvas, hubo la actuación de 
un excelente grupo musical  que amenizó la fiesta, con dos o tres bises a petición de los comensales, por la gran actuación de su cantante.

Finalmente, debo recomendarles este hotel, para celebraciones familiares o actos sociales, ya que podrán contar con un ambiente, entorno e instalaciones muy adecuadas, para no salir en absoluto defraudado de su inversión.",4,2014,01,02
28,Sobrevalorado,"Esperaba mucho más de este hotel.Pero no todo es negativo.
Recepción privada en planta 25. Mientras se espera para realizar el check in se nos ofrece una bebida de bienvenida.
Habitación Junior Suite Executive amplia pero con falta de mantenimiento y limpieza. Aquí empezamos lo que no tendría que suceder es un establecimiento de esta categoría. El aire acondicionado no funcionaba y la temperatura no bajaba de 24 grados. Después de hablar varias veces con la recepción de The Level me aseguran que el chico de mantenimiento reinicio todo y que ya funciona. A la mañana siguiente, todavía hacia 24º con lo cual no he podido descansar con tanto calor. Pero, como te dicen que esta todo arreglado......
También avise para arreglar un enchufe cerca de la mesa de trabajo. Para poder conectar el ordenador tenia que desenchufar la lampara o la Nespresso. Sigo esperando el técnico.
La tasa del water de plástico barato y mal colocada. Las cortinas con manchas enormes. Pero lo mejor, y no entiendo que la gobernanta dé el visto bueno ( le tendría que dar vergüenza) para dar la habitación como limpia, cuando encima del mueble bar hay una capa de polvo ( y no es un olvido de 1 día o 2).
La cena en el restaurante DO2 (menú degustación) muy buena (punto negativo al cava que no estaba frio).
Nueva sorpresa en el desayuno. Sala muy pequeña para todos los clientes. Al final acabo desayunando encima de un taburete compartiendo una barra con mas personas. Y para colmo, volver del buffet con un plato y ver que los camareros ya te quitaron tus cubiertos y taza para preparar el sitio para otro cliente,
En la planta 25 ademas de la recepción privada también esta el salón The Level. Pude comprobar que la gente no estaba muy contenta con el hotel.
También quiero comentar que, aunque la habitación tenga un vestíbulo con puerta, la insonorización es malisima, Se oyen todos los ruidos del pasillo,
Eso si, el personal, muy amable, pero no te solucionan nada,

En fin, este hotel esta mas que sobre valorado y con unos precios muy altos para lo que ofrece.

Muy decepcionado conociendo otros hoteles de la cadena Melia.",3,2013,12,30
28,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt nicht im Stadtzentrum was ich als sehr angenehm empfinde. Hier findet das ""echte"" Leben gleich um die Ecke statt. Der Strand ist nicht weit, die U-Bahn auch nicht.
Wir haben den super Service im The Level sehr genossen. Wir wurden sehr nett und aufmerksam betreut, das Essen dort war sehr lecker und die Getränke auch inklusive.
Alles in allem kann ich das Hotel sehr empfehlen, sowohl für private Aufenthalte als auch für geschäftliche Zwecke. Die Meetingsräume sind zahlreich und sehr verschieden. Für jeden Fall was dabei. 
Unser Zimmer im 27 Stock hatte einen grandiosen Blick auf die Stadt und das Konzept des eigenen Enpfangs für The Level Gäste finde ich großartig. Wo sonst bekommt man bei Ankunft gleich einen Chanmpagner in die Hand gedrückt? :-)
Alles in Allem kann und werde ich das Hotel jederzeit mit sehr guten Gewissen weiterempfehlen.",5,2013,12,30
28,The Level,"Sono stata a metà Novembre in questo hotel e sono stata benissimo!!! Mi hanno dato una camera nel piano 28 con viste stupende, il servizio non poteva essere più cortese, attenti ai dettagli in tutti i momenti. Il giorno del mio compleanno mi hanno portato una piccola torta mentre facevo colazione nel piano 25...una piacevolissima sorpresa!
Vado spesso a Barcellona e sicuramente tornerò al The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky",5,2013,12,25
28,Inmejorable e excepcional,"Estube alojada a finales de noviembre y la experiencia fue increible. Desde el momento que haces el check in, el personal te hace sentir especial. La habitación, una junior suite, era increible!! Las vistas al mar eran espectaculares.
La verdad es que vale la pena hacer una reserva con el The Level. Sin duda lo voy a recomendar a todas mis amistades y familiares, y como, repetiré. 
Gracias a todo el personal por hacer de esa noche una experiencia increible y especial.
Sin duda, el Melia Bacelona Sky es uno de los hoteles que refleja la gran calidad de la cadena Melià.",5,2013,12,17
28,Fantástico,"Estuvimos alojados el pasado fin de semana en el Hotel, el hotel nos encantó, las vistas de barcelona extraordinarias . Nosotros teniamos la habitación en el piso 22 y la verdad que vale la pena, además con esta reserva nos entraba la opción the level que nos pareció increible! Era fantástico poder volver de visitar la ciudad y relajarse en el salón del piso 25 donde tenias todas las bebidas incluidas y todo tipo de aperitivos, además el personal era fantástico, atento en todo momento a cualquier cosa que necesitáramos, nuestro agradecimiento a Yolanda que nos dió un trato exquisito durante toda nuestra estáncia. Volveremos seguro!",5,2013,12,09
28,Hotel increible - Servicio inmejorable - comida excelente. Experiencia inolvidable!,"Tener la oportunidad de alojarme en el hotel ha sido una experiencia inolvidable. Recomendado por un gran amigo (las recomendaciones son muy subjetivas) es un hecho real que el hotel expresa todo el potencial que uno imagina tras un edificio tan espectacular: Check in preciso, elegante y efectivo realizado por David (superando mis expectativas tras una calida sonrisa y gran conocimiento) y con la oportunidad de obtener un upgrade a The Level. La habitacion en la planta 21 supero todo lo que imaginaba: funcional, amplia, con una combinacion de vistas sobre la ciudad que dan personalidad al hotel. La sorpresa y un momento inesperado para mi pareja (es lo que alimenta esta experiencia WOW) es haber coordinado un regalo con un gran y profesional Alfredo, que gracias a su conocimiento y recomendacion consegui sorprenderla (cumplia 39) con una botella de cava y unas fresas con chocolate. En ese momento tuve la sensacion de ser el unico cliente en el hotel otra vez. Por trabajo me he alojado en muchos hoteles en Barcelona, Europa y por placer en practicamente todo el mundo, desde 4 a 5 estrellas, y uno siente la necesided de compartir una noche inolvidable cuando se siente que hay un trabajo y organizacion tan bien engrasada. Tras cenar en un restaurante de la ciudad nos tomamos un gin&tonic en el bar  que el cocktelero patricio? nos dejo un buen sabor de boca!!! Finalmente tuve la oporunidad de desayunar en el restaurante un fresco buffet para comenzar bien el dia con mi sorprendida pareja. Es un hotel para alojarser cada vez que uno vaya a Barcelona para poder disfrutarlo.GRACIAS!",5,2013,11,29
28,Una noche inolvidable,"Estuve el pasado día 10 en el The Level para regalarle una noche diferente a mi pareja.
Desde el momento en el que llegamos nos sentimos muy mimados. En la recepción nos informaron que con nuestra tarifa nos daba acceso a la planta 25. Una pasada!! Ya que dispones de unas vistas de la ciudad espectaculares desde la habitación.
Felicitar al personal que son todos de 10, en especial a Alejandra por el trato personalizado que nos dio y su calidad humana, pues nos hizo la estancia muy agradable y nos resolvió algún que otro problemilla.
Queríamos que fuera una noche diferente y lo fue!
Estoy seguro de que volveré pronto!",5,2013,11,27
28,Para aprovecharlo.....,"Este hotel es excelente. Mi calificación global no es esa solo por un motivo: la zona donde se encuentra.
Las instalaciones son modernas y de diseño, acordes al desarrollo que quieren dar al barrio. El personal amable y dispuesto a ayudarte. Las habitaciones amplias y cuidadas, aunque hay que hacer un máster para controlar las luces. Y, sobre todo, EXCELENTE el restaurante... del que opinare aparte.

Para volver, aunque los precios han subido mucho en un mes. Cuando he querido repetir, casi se habían duplicado. Claro que no sé si son cosas de la agencia de mi empresa ( American Expresa Barcelo) que tiene sus intereses particulares....",4,2013,11,16
28,Super Hotel,"Einfach genial der Service und die Dienstleistung.
Zimmer (Junior Suite) mit grandiosem Ausblick über die Stadt.

Ich werde sicher das Hotel weiter Empfehlen und nochmals besuchen.",5,2013,11,15
28,"HOTEL ESPECTACULAR, TRATO IMPRESIONANTE.","No me he equivocado al poner mi opinion sobre este hotel en MAYUSCULAS, este hotel no deja de sorprenderte desde que haces el check in, hasta que llega el momento del check out, las vistas de las habitaciones son impresionantes y el hotel en general espectacular.

Mediante la presente, me gustaria dar las gracias a todo el personal del Hotel Melia Barcelona Sky por el buen trato recibido en mi estancia y en especial a Yolanda del departamento de recepcion The Level, no tengo palabras para describir la profesionalidad, dedicacion y amabilidad con la que fuimos obsequiados en la ultima estancia en este hotel. 

Acabamos de irnos y ya estamos deseando volver.",5,2013,11,13
28,SORPRENDENTE,"Sin duda una buena elección. Tenía entendido que los Meliá eran un estilo más ""rococo"" pero la realidad es que te encuentras con un hotel moderno y vanguardista. Lo que más me gusto fueron las vistas hacia la ciudad, impresionantes, y el trato de los recepcionistas a la llegada!! En la planta baja un restaurante que tuvimos la ocasión de probar y que no nos defraudo. Y en una de las plantas altas un restaurante de estrella Michelin que no tuvimos tiempo de probar. El único contra que le encuentro a este (y otros hoteles) es que no haya ningún tipo de descuento en los servicios del hotel para los clientes alojados. Lo demás un 10!",5,2013,11,12
28,Maravilloso!!!!,"Nos alojamos en The Level @ Meliá Barcelona Sky a principios de Noviembre y definitivamente puedo decir que la experiencia superó nuestras expectativas desde el primer momento y que cuando vuelva a Barcelona repetiré sin duda!!!. 

Las habitaciones modernas, super espaciosas y funcionales, derrochan estilo y la nuestra, en una de las últimas plantas, ofrecía unas vistas espectaculares de la ciudad y el mar Mediterráneo. La cama sin duda de las más cómodas que he probado en un hotel!!!. Realmente no se puede pedir más!!!.

La noche que llegamos pedimos room service y antes de que nos diésemos cuenta la cena estaba ya en la habitación, una delicia!. El desayuno super variado y todo estaba buenisimo!.

En resumen, todo fue perfecto... El hotel es maravilloso y desde luego cabe destacar sobre todo que el personal es de 10, siempre están dispuestos a ayudar con una sonrisa, adelantándose a tus necedidades y son los que hacen posible que alojarse en el hotel sea toda una experiencia inolvidable que querrás repetir!",5,2013,11,06
28,Minimalista,Bien ubicado y con acceso rápido al trasporte público. Muy cerca de la Torre Abgar que se ilumina de noche adornando el paseo. Habitaciones cómodas con 3/4 partes de sus paredes de vidrio desde donde se puede observar el Templo de la Sagrada Familia y hasta el mar. Buen desayuno y personal muy diligente. Wi Fi incluída en el precio de la habitación. No es un hotel económico pero vale la pena. Los amantes de los hoteles clásicos abstenerse,4,2013,11,02
28,"Diseño, vanguardismo y un sinfín de detalles...","Decidimos pasar un fin de semana especial entre amigos y nos inclinamos por Sky Barcelona.
Nada más llegar al The Level Lounge todo el equipo de Sky Barcelona se desvive para que te sientas como un cliente especial.
Atención personalizada, trato muy profesional y correcto que transmite calidez y logran que te sientas como en casa.
Nos proporcionaron una preciosa suite en la planta 21, especialmente preparada por Paula y Alfredo, a quien agradecemos todos los detalles en nuestra estancia.
Lo recomendamos a todas las personas que quieran disfrutar de unas excelentes vistas, de uno de los mejores restaurantes de Barcelona y estar en un hotel de moda.
Felicidades a todo el equipo!",5,2013,10,30
28,Estancia Inolvidable,"Reserve el The Level para celebrar mi aniversario con mi pareja y debo decir que ha sido una estancia inolvidable. Desde el momento de llamar para hacer la reserva, Iván, me atendió dandome detalle de cada habitación y ofreciendo los diferentes tipos de paquetes y sorpresas que podían preparar para sorprender a mi novia. Al final reserve una junior suite con vistas a la ciudad y pedi que nos decorarán la habitación con velas, incienso y pétalos de rosa... el resultado fue fantástico, al entrar en la habitación teniamos un camino de petalos de rosa que llegaba hasta la cama, todo estaba iluminado con una lámpara roja que tienen en la habitación y que creaba una atmósfera romántica junto con las velas encendidas y con el aroma a incienso, teniamos una botella de cava y fresas con chocolate esperandonos en la mesita de noche y al entrar al lavabo nos encontramos la bañera preparada con pétalos de rosas tambien... la habitación era enorme y con un diseño único, al abrir las cortinas otra sorpresa... unas vistas espectaculares a la Sagrada Familia y al Tibidabo... el cuadro perfecto para una noche romántica en Barcelona... la sorpresa era para mi novia que salió encantada pero debo confesar que yo también me llevé la sorpresa con cada detalle que ibamos descubriendo. Me gustaría felicitar y agradecer a Ivan por haberlo organizado todo, estoy seguro que para nuestra proxima celebración volveremos y lo recomendaré a todos para una celebración romántica.",5,2013,10,30
28,Volveré...,"Solo quería agradecer la fantastica atención que he recibido por parte del personal del Level y recomendar a todo el mundo este hotel, viajo durante todo el año alrededor del mundo y debo decir que el trato y la atención con la que me atendieron han sido únicos y excepcionales, sobre todo por parte de Yolanda, Diego y Simone... 
Por supuesto el resto del hotel tambien es fantástico, muy moderno y de diseño, las habitaciones son muy acogedoras, limpias y con fantásticas vistas a la Sagrada Familia. Sin duda volveré a este hotel cuando tenga que regresar a Barcelona.",5,2013,10,26
28,Fantástico!,"Me he alojado en septiermbre durante un fin de semana en The Level y debo decir que me ha vuelto a sorprender, ya había estado anteriormente cuando todavía era el ME Barcelona y ya me había encantado pero con los cambios que han hecho ahora me gusta más... El lounge es mucho mas acogedor, no te dan ganas de irte con esas vistas a Barcelona, el buffet de comida ha mejorado mucho pero sobretodo el personal, son fantásticos y siempre dispuestos a ayudarte en todo y muy amables. Las habitaciones son chulísimas, yo he reservado una vista mar y anteriormente habia reservado una vista ciudad, prefiero las vistas a la ciudad pero las habitaciones vista mar son mas grandes y con bañera... en fin es mi tercera vez y no será la última",5,2013,10,23
28,Mi nuevo hogar en Barcelona,"Acabo de volver de un fin de semana en este hotel en el que ya me había alojado anteriormente pero aunque siempre me ha gustado mi compañia me enviaba a su hotel hermano el Melia Sarria el cual me gusta tambien y siempre me he sentido bien acogido pero esta vez no tenian disponibilidad por lo que he vuelto al Melia Sky (Antes ME Barcelona). Debo decir que con las nuevas reformas que han hecho en The Level y otras instalaciones pedire a mi compañía me vuelvan a enviar siempre a este hotel, el trato del personal es impecable, siempre sonrientes y encantados de ayudarte en todo lo que necesites, las vistas siguen siendo fabulosas, no recordaba que en verdad te quitan el aliento cuando te acercas a la ventana y observas... las habitaciones limpias y comodas aunque el mobiliario necesita un poco de renovación tambien pero muy de diseño y chulas. La piscina tambien ha sido reformada y aunque durante mi visita estaba lloviendo y no pude disfrurla mucho imagino que con sol no querras salir de ahi... en fin que pienso volver siempre que visite Barcelona y lo recomiendo a todo mundo!!",5,2013,10,19
28,Personal muy atento,"Pasé un fin de semana con mi pareja en Barcelona y nos alojamos aquí. Las vistas fueron estupendas y el personal muy atento.

28,Un espacio de lujo!,"La estancia ha sido estupenda y el trato del personal de todo el hotel inmejorable!
