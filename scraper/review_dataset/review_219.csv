219,"Chirag n Shriya were very humble , guiding and  helpful through your our stay in Dublin","We liked the location was very easy to go through the city , staff was very friendly. We first met Chirag in the counter who did our check in , from then till we left the hotel he was very cooperative. They even packed our breakfast s when we had early trips to do Thank you",5,2024,10,18
219,Just part of Suzanne's group.,"Fantastic rooms both times we stayed! Very clean rooms! Great hospitable staff! Isabel was very helpful. She gave me an extra elevator key when I had left ours with my wife in the breakfast area. Then she guided me to the elevator but I thanked her and did the stairs. Great exercise!
I look forward to coming again someday, maybe bringing more than just one daughter..
Dios Te Bendiga!",5,2024,10,17
219,No Complaints !,"Stayed in The Address Connolly for one night in September. We had a very comfortable stay. We arrived a bit early but the Receptionist very kindly arranged access to our room. The room was clean with a very  comfortable bed. All staff we came across were friendly and helpful
Special mention for Emma who efficiently  arranged for some items we left behind to be posted on to us. Hotel is in a great central location close to transport hubs .
Not cheap but then again this is central Dublin!",5,2024,10,14
219,Just OK,"The hotel was ok. When we arrived the bedroom was like a furnace. We put the air conditioning on and it was so noisy we had to turn it off. The room itself was adequate. The mini bar was empty so I‚Äôm thinking that this is on the same level as Premier Inns. 
We put the make the room sign on the door when we left the hotel at 11am. When we returned at 4.30 it was still not done. I spoke to the housekeeping guy outside and he said he would do it now but we said it‚Äôs too late we need to get changed. The bar area is great and the staff were lovely. The breakfast was very good, lots of choice. 
Sadly the location of the hotel is not good, it‚Äôs by the station so you get a lot of litter outside the hotel and also a lot of people who are homeless sleeping nearby . My husband got offered drugs on 2 occasions. I know they can‚Äôt help it but it doesn‚Äôt help you want to come back.",3,2024,10,14
219,Visit for Wolfe Tones Concert.,"On arrival Isobel greeted us at reception.  She was very helpful as we had stayed there before.  They stored our luggage at reception as room was not ready when we arrived.  This is a handy option.  
We were then checked into a twin room on the 4th floor.  It was very comfortable and also came with a walk in shower which was handy.  Breakfast was buffet and was nice enough.   Well done to everyone there for a lovely stay.",5,2024,10,13
219,Don't care about customer satisfaction,"So booked a club room at this hotel, arrived to the room around 9pm and created by the most horrendous smell of mould. Flagged it at reception and after waiting half an hour the manager cam to the room. Agreed it smelt but advised there were no other rooms free. After another half an hour he turned up with an air freshener and expected us to put up with it or his words leave and find another hotel. They would not refund us though as it's in there policies no refunds. 

After a bit of back and forth they loved us to another room which also smelt but not as bad. 

The air con is stupidly loud and you cannot sleep if it's on. 

No kettle just a coffee machine 
No bath
No robes 

We were moved to a basic room not a club what we paid for 

On checkout I airer concerns again and asked for a refund which they point blank refused. 

They are trying hard to be quirky and forgetting all the basics of comfort and customer services 

I would never stay here again and would not recommend",1,2024,10,02
219,Warning,"Stayed for 3 nights for our first trip to Dublin, firstly the main reason we booked this hotel was for the spa and pool when we tried all three days to use it we were told it wasn‚Äôt working and will be working the following day but didn‚Äôt our whole stay :( secondly for our second day we got up to start our day as we had bookings for things to do and the water wasn‚Äôt working at all and was told it would work in the next thirty minutes but when I called again they then said another up to two hours so we had to buy water bottles to wash ourselves. Like other reviews we‚Äôve seen the aircon barely works and our room was boiling hot. Staff were nice though and helpful with bags and also has a lovely restaurant attached too x just a shame with not living up to our expectations and what we paid for x",2,2024,09,19
219,Utterly appalling,"On checking in at 10,45pm I found my room was 30degrees + and the aircon deafening but ineffectual.  I had to find an alternative hotel as, despite seeing someone else check in as I left,  they said they had no more rooms.
So a ‚Ç¨12 taxi ride and an additional ‚Ç¨100 later I finally got to bed at gone midnight.
This hotel offered zero assistance or contribution to my extra costs, never mind any form of compensation.
50% off a future stay when I have no plans to return to Dublin was frankly an insult.
They should be ashamed to say they are part of the hospitality industry",1,2024,09,19
219,Good hotel and very friendly,"This hotel is lovely and the staff go out of their way to be very helpful and friendly. 
The smell of the hotel and its toiletries is fabulous and I‚Äôd love to know what it is?
We were part of the club lounge that although lovely with a roof terrace, didn‚Äôt have much in the way of breakfast stock when required. The North restaurant at the hotel was ok food-wise, but not wowzer. The hotel is approx 20 mins walk to the centre of the city and also opposite the train station and taxi rank. The trains were not very loud, so all good there. 
I would definitely visit the is hotel again.",4,2024,09,16
219,Overviewing Dublin,"We had a very comfortable stay in our room on the 9th floor, with an amazing view over Dublin.
Needed help with the air condition late at night and a very nice guy called Ahmet helped us.
Thanks Ahmet for your patience and time. After that we had a very good sleep, 
We had to start to the airport early in the morning, the Dublin airport express stops nearby.
We come back next time",5,2024,09,12
219,"Trying too hard to be cool, while ignoring the basics","Like many of the other reviews I would highlight the potential for this hotel to improve by focusing on the basics rather than attempting to be cool.
The staff do appear to be doing their best.
Room: 
No kettle was supplied so I was reduced to using the coffee machine for hot water. The resulting tea tasted strange. In contrast the coffee pods were very flavourful and there was a good selection.
The hot and cold taps were reversed, showing poor attention to detail.
The door lock didn't work, the member of staff who dealt with this issue was helpful but was not able to resolve it during our stay.
The beds were very comfortable with a good amount of pillows.
Food:
The evening meal was mediocre at best, not adequately seasoned, fish wasn't the best quality tasted like it had been cooked from frozen.
Full Irish breakfast was tasty but only lukewarm.
The Cellar space was funky art deco, staff were helpful and made us a pot of tea on request.",3,2024,09,12
219,Excellent location for walking around Dublin,"Room a good size, very comfortable bed. No view only apartments next door. Staff pleasant and helpful. Only downside water pressure in shower. But had a bath. Location excellent can walk anywhere from the hotel. Numerous movie channels on TV.",4,2024,09,06
219,Ideal for a quick one night stay for concert at Croke,"Stayed here as it was really handy for Coldplay concert, but probably wouldn't stay again.  The area around the hotel is very grubby and it didn't feel very safe.  The decor of this hotel is beautiful in the lobby and bar area.  However, the room didn't look like the pictures at all.

Some of the furniture seemed very tired for a new hotel and the bathroom was extremely dark.  No light at the shower side of the room, maybe to hide the dirty grout work.

The main bar/restaurant was like a sauna, not a comfortable heat at all and the bar staff could do with some retraining in manners and customer service.  

The nicest members of staff were the porters and cleaning staff.  The beds were very comfy, great pillows and great towels.",3,2024,09,03
219,ROBBERY,"ROBBERY!!!!

Stay away from this ‚Äúpremium‚Äù hotel.

Upgraded to their most exclusive room to the tune of ¬£900 for the weekend, to gain access to their exclusive roof top lounge with breakfast.

This included cold coffee, some apples and a piece of cake. üò≤

Went to get actual breakfast and they wanted another ¬£100 for the pleasure.

Went to eat in their ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù North restaurant and was asked to take a seat and have a drink whilst they sorted the table, we then watched 3 walk in parties be seated whilst we waited because they‚Äôd forgotten about us. 

Absolutely nothing premium about this hotel, apart from what they charge for not even average facilities. 

4th time staying in Dublin and this is hands down the WORST hotel to date.

STAY AWAY!!!!",1,2024,08,31
219,Safety concerns and too much exclusivity,"Visited for one night. This hotel is very nice aesthetically, but there were a few things that really rubbed me the wrong way. Got up to my fourth floor room and had trouble with the touch control in the room. It would have been nice for them to explain at check in how to use the panel but instead I had to flag down a maid to help me. 

Later I was relaxing on the bed watching TV and was thinking about hopping in the shower and a man (another guest) keyed into my room. I said ‚ÄúExcuse me!?‚Äù And he profusely apologized and left. I could have easily been in a state of undress and as a solo female traveler, I was understandably a little spooked by it! Clearly the hotel either double booked or gave out duplicate keys to my room. 

Later on, my key to my room just stopped working and I had to go back downstairs to get new keys. 

The hallway of my room was very loud with people going in and out and letting the door to the hallway slam (including cleaning staff) so I was awoken pretty early by noise. 

In the morning I got a coffee after flagging down someone to help me in the cafe and took my breakfast croissant to ‚ÄúThe Place‚Äù to eat. I was promptly told I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be there because it was exclusive to certain guests. I wasn‚Äôt bothering anyone and it wasn‚Äôt crowded at the time. 

Come to find out there‚Äôs a lot of exclusivity that isn‚Äôt properly explained when you book because I was not allowed up to the lounge or spa either. All of that awkwardness could‚Äôve been avoided if they just had a handout at check in about what your booking includes and doesn‚Äôt include.",2,2024,08,30
219,Top class,"Stayed here last night. This hotel is very central and has alot to offer. Rooms very comfortable and  up to date.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  All staff  especially  isabel was very welcoming at reception desk. 
Breakfast was amazing and well presented",5,2024,08,26
219,Clean and modern room,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel our first night in Dublin on our first trip to Ireland.  The hotel has a unique feel and is very comfortable. The staff were all great and friendly. As our plane landed at 06:00 AM, they gladly held our bags for the day until check in. They were correctly and quickly retrieved upon return and we were advised that we‚Äôd received a complimentary upgrade to a ‚Äúclub room‚Äù which was very modern and allowed access to the 7th floor club. We‚Äôre not sure why we got the upgrade but we were happy to have gotten it. The room was clean, large and modern. The bed was comfortable as were the plentiful pillows. The bathroom was spacious and easy to use. We also dined at one the several restaurants and had a good experience there as well. We would definitely stay again",5,2024,08,21
219,Isabel,"Stayed in The Address a number of times fantastic Hotel and Fantastic service staff are very nice a lady on reception named Isabel who I have dealt with each time is a major asset to the hotel always very helpful with everything if I could give it 10 starts I would I stay here because the service is so good thanks to Isabel  and it's so central food is great very clean and as always I will be back.

Gracias Isabel.",5,2024,08,19
219,Beautiful hotel,"Fabulous hotel, cannot recommend enough this is our 4th stay at the address on Connolly, isabel at checkout is a huge asset to the hotel on our second stay she recognised us immediately we are always greeted with a smile wonderful lady one of the main reasons we return to the  Address on connolly, food is fantastic the rooms are beautiful central location 10/10 üëå",5,2024,08,19
219,Nice enough but sketchy location,"I stayed in the club room and the bed was very comfy and was a good size but the views are not exactly picturesque. It is in a pretty dodgy area with quite a few homeless people in the area and the drug use is rife. I know the hotel has no control over this but it is something to bare in mind. The additional ‚Ç¨25 for using the pool though is scandalous. Nice enough hotel, nice decor, handy to most places but not amazing ",3,2024,08,17
219,Came for our Anniversary- Wouldn‚Äôt come again,"Came here for two nights. Club room right next to the train tracks?! Why, when someone is staying for two nights would you put them in that room, sounded like a train was coming through your room. Also because of how close to the track you are you can‚Äôt have your curtains open. Rooms nice enough, has a smart system where lights and curtains can be controlled from your bed. Guest areas are clean, nice decor but have lots of men and woman sat around with flip flops  and lots of bags for life around them? Locations- as in distances from the bars and restaurants was ok l. It was around a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar. The area is dirty, and full of some scruffy looking people. On our way back one night a man ran past us as a guy chased him on a bike, running man claimed he was trying to mug him. We were on a room only rate due to the high prices these places like to charge but would recommend eating at the stage door cafe and Sophie‚Äôs roof top bar. We did eat in the restaurant one evening-didn‚Äôt have a booking but they fitted us in. Nice meal and cocktails. House keeping didn‚Äôt make an appearance. We had the pool and Spa facilities with our booking but didn‚Äôt have a chance to use these so can‚Äôt comment not that we were told about these at check in which I feel should have been.",3,2024,08,16
219,Would not return,"Service is a hit & miss - Isabella was lovely but Daniel was rude and very unpleasant! I had a few interactions with both and they remained consistent.
I stayed in 3 rooms whilst I was here and they were all Club Rooms which had a fancy operating system. Though, some of the lamps did not work and more importantly, the bathrooms were not the cleanest with hair all over the walls and in the corners.
Bath panel also popped off in the middle of the night which we had to fix.
There was dirty next to the toilet too.
The sink tap was consistently falling off despite them fixing it. We had to fix it or it meant the tap was left running!
I supported all of this with pictures and an email. They did not reply to me.
You also had to pay extra to use the spa which was not great.
Breakfast was ok but not worth the money.
And the rooftop lounge looks better in pictures.. very anti-climatic.
Overall, not good value for money.
For club rooms, there are lifts specifically for access to these rooms only. In our last 2 days, that lift was not working. The lady at reception was not keen to help and just brushed me away without explaining anything. A kind person was then able to help me with the card usage to access to other lift.
Also, you are only able to use the WiFi in the lobby and rooms. not around the hotel.
The restaurant at the front had great service and great food but again, quite overpriced for what it was.
Location was amazing!
I unfortunately had an incident at my time at this hotel which lead to me having to make alternative arrangements to find a new room. I upsettingly asked for help at reception at 9pm that night. They quoted me 200 euros for another room. I felt that this quite was ridiculous and also felt that they were taking advantage of my situation. I then ended up connecting to WiFi and booking for half the price via Booking.com.
Overall, I would not return unfortunately but like everywhere, some staff members are nicer than others. I felt that the women were particularly lovely to us but the men were very unpleasent.",2,2024,08,15
219,Great stay!,"A beautiful hotel, close to everything!  Check in was a breeze and they kept our large luggage for us for a week until we could return from Wales.  People are super helpful and the restaurant / bar was exceptional.  The porters were very helpful with our luggage and getting around.  We would  definitely stay here again.",5,2024,08,13
219,"The AC leaked massively - they moved us in 2 nights, to 3 rooms, and every room had massive AC leaks/water damage.","DO NOT STAY HERE. EMAIL I SENT AFTER OUR STAY, AND I'VE HEARD NOTHING BACK FROM THEM - MAJOR WATER LEAKING/AC ISSUES, AND BLOOD ON OUR SHEETS.
Good afternoon,
I'm giving you a chance to reply before sharing publicly on social media platforms, but so far, I have emailed 4 people within the management about these issues, and have not gotten any reply.
To Whom It May Concern,
We recently stayed at The Address Connolly in Dublin, Ireland, and could not be more disappointed and appalled by the conditions in which we stayed, that were addressed in a less than satisfactory manner.
We checked in on July 22, and we stayed for 2 nights, checking out on July 24, 2024. We booked a family room/suite, as our travel party was myself and my husband, and our two children, ages 12 and 14. We were given 2 rooms that adjoined, which was fine with us as we had them close and we were all together.
On the morning of July 23, I woke up to get ready for the day and went towards the bathroom to get in the shower. I slipped completely, on what, to my surprise and shock, was water all over our floor. The air conditioner had apparently been dripping significantly throughout the night, and the floor was flooded with water. Had I not quickly grabbed onto the small stand with the coffee maker on it, I would have completely fallen and possibly truly have hurt myself.
We had a train booked to Howth that day, so we had plans to be gone for most of the day. I used the shower in the adjoining room, and we went and discussed this situation with the front desk. They assured us they would look into it and make sure it was fixed or we would be moved to another room, and they would help move our stuff in our absence. I asked for the manager and asked if we were to be reimbursed for this room for the night, as this was not even remotely acceptable. He looked directly at me and said it was most unlikely that anything would be done in terms of any compensation at all.
When we returned from a full day trip to Howth, around 7:30pm, all we wanted to do was go to our rooms, shower, relax, and go to bed. We checked at the front desk, and they assured us that our room was repaired and all would be fine for the night - that we did not need to change rooms. While skeptical, we went to our rooms, to find that it was all dried and set back to right a bit.
So, we turned on the AC, and set about getting ready to get into bed. Within 30 minutes, our AC/ceiling was leaking significantly - AGAIN. So, nothing was actually repaired - they simply dried up the leak, and kept us in a room that had a major leaking issue.
We went to the front desk again - even though we were beat, and had already been told this issue was resolved - and again asked for the manager. It was a different one this time. He apologized, and offered us free breakfast the next morning, and a new room. So, now we had dealt with this issue in the morning, which was a hassle, in hopes we would NOT have to deal with is anymore. Instead, we were dealing with it again because a band aid was applied instead of a fix. However, with the new room, they told us we would NOT have a family suite. So - we would be in totally different rooms from our children, though we had booked and paid for the adjoining family rooms. We were very unhappy about this, and asked that he call his general manager, who was off for the evening. The GM basically told us we could take this free breakfast and a new, completely separate room, or stay in the room that had water dripping all over the floor, coffee stand, and ceiling. With no recourse, we took the new room, which at the very least was on the same floor as our children, so we were just down the hall on Floor 8.
As soon as we walked into the new room, we were absolutely appalled. This room apparently had an even worse issue with the air conditioner, and there were water marks all around the ceiling unit AND the paint was peeling all around it as well. We turned on the AC, just in case it was old damage and the unit had been repaired, and in less than 10 minutes, water was dripping from the ceiling all around the AC unit.
At this point, we had:
1. Addressed it first thing in the morning - told it would be resolved by time we got back from our day trip
2. Were given the SAME room when we returned from a full and tiring day's travel - and experienced the exact same issue
3. Gotten a new - and separate - room from our children - and walked into this room only to experience and even worse, but exact, same issue with water.
By this time, we were both extremely frustrated as well as exhausted. Keith, my husband, went back yet again to the front desk and we went though it all again. Again, the GM was called - and again, they said the exact same thing - go to either our original (and damaged) room, take the new room, with an even bigger issue, OR - they could give us yet ANOTHER room, but this one would be even further from our children, on floor 9.
We took that room with no other choice. We also decided, since we were now so far from our children, and one would sleep with each of us, so we would be with our kids at the very least. I walked into the new room on floor 9 - turned on the AC - and within about 30 minutes, there was leaking water on the floor. At this point, it was about 10pm. We had been moved 3 times, and every single room had a leaking AC issue. We were given beyond poor and rude customer service by the General Manager from a phone call from the working manager on the floor in the evening, and rude customer service from the morning working manager. We had been gone an entire day on a day trip, were exhausted, and for all of us, were given simply - sorry, here's a free breakfast voucher for a day.
This is beyond unacceptable in every way from the room, to maintenance of your hotel, and to your management staff and customer service.
As a travel agent, I am very well versed in travel, and the things that sometimes just go with travel, various differences in countries in terms of room sizes, amenities, etc. However, this is simply unacceptable in ANY country, for ANY hotel, for customers - let alone one that claims to be 4 star hotel that, according to your own website, claims ""The Address Connolly promises the ultimate 4 star hotel experience full of special touches that surprise and delight.""
I can attest to the ""surprises"" - but they were far from special or delightful, indeed. - To top this all off, as if all of this wasn't bad enough, we also pulled down our comforter to get into bed, only to see a blood stain on the sheets that we had to ask to have changed. Another surprise, that again, was well less than delightful.
I look forward to hearing back from the appropriate personnel so we can settle this issue with the appropriate recompense for our stay.",1,2024,08,12
219,Terrible experience,"Upon arrival there was no hairdryer as stated on the website. Also no bath even though we were led to belive there would be one, this must be requested. After a day of sightseeing we returned back to relax and watch something on the tv. There is an option for prime netflix etc, however when we were unable to connect to this we called reception. Sorin on the desk informs me repeatably there is nothing that can be done and after a long conversation that lasted about 20 min. I asked about maybe a another room. His colleague tells us none of tvs can in fact connect to Internet. Even though there is the option for this. We have paid an awful lot of money to be here to be severely let down amd disappointed. The note was printed on reception and will led you he offered a second room. It was me that suggested it. This place seems great. But is just an overpriced  bed and breakfast. I give this place 0 stars for amenities. 0 for night manager",1,2024,08,10
219,Good hotel poor situation.,"This is a really good hotel, friendly helpful staff, bedroom comfortable and shower clean. The meals in the restaurant were good but a very limited choice for vegetarians.
However, the area where the hotel is situated is a real letdown. There are no local restaurants and shops and the area is very scruffy. It is more than 10 minutes walk to the river and Epic museum and about 20 minutes plus walk to the Spire and the Hop On Hop Off bus stop. It is a real shame as the hotel deserves to be in a more pleasant  area. 
We are elderly and not fit and we would not have stayed so far from central Dublin but this was Railbookers choice.",4,2024,08,10
219,Bad Service And Lack Of Communication Between Employees,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here and I must say this has to be one of the worst hotels in Dublin for service, As we first checked in the man in reception didn‚Äôt really explain anything at all which left us stranded searching for our room. The room was superb and nothing was out of place and was really clean, We bought late checkout through Booking.com but yet they still knocked on our door at 12:22pm and rang us stating we have to check out about an hour later, keeping in mind late checkout is at two o‚Äôclock. The lifts in the building were on and off for example one hour the keycard would work and the next you would be left stuck, So I would not recommend to bring anyone with a disability who would rely on such. Room service is virtually non-existent. As we had a club room they advertised 24 hour service which was not the case, As soon as the clock hit 9pm you couldn‚Äôt get an answer. The next day we were rudely awoken by maintenance at 09.30 AM, He did not knock and the door was on Do Not Disturb but he still entered the room and startled us of course.",3,2024,08,08
219,Would stay here again,"This hotel is perfect for a short stay. It is a short walk away from the town centre, and 29 minutes away from each major tourist attraction. The decor and aesthetic is tasteful and warm. 
My only criticism would be that the spa is slightly over priced. The hydro pool, a steam room and a sauna - which are all on timers, cost ‚Ç¨25 per person per day on top of your booking. It seems a little steep for what you actually get there. It‚Äôs open access but I personally think you‚Äôre pushing it if there‚Äôs more than 6 people in the spa at once. 
The breakfast buffet options were nice, although it‚Äôs a little steep in price too. They had something for everyone. They have some cool gadgets which help with self service, like the pancake maker. 
I would definitely stay here again but probably wouldn‚Äôt pay the extra for the spa. 
I can‚Äôt fault the staff at all. They were all helpful and kind consistently. The hotel has a good attention to detail, from what the staff wear, to cutlery, to wall art. It was a beautiful stay.",5,2024,08,06
219,Wonderful,"The address hotel is very automotive, and what I really love is their customer service, the reception always active 24/7, and complaint dealt with swiftly. They have a great spa, and a great mini gym, and good food for guest. They rooms are also very clean, and attractive.",5,2024,08,05
219,‚ÄúSpa‚Äù,"I would like to start off by saying that the hotel itself was absolutely perfect. So big and spacious. The decor was absolutely perfect would 100% go back for that!!

On the other hand paying ‚Ç¨25 to go to the ‚Äúspa‚Äù is ridiculous. For the size of the hotel it looked like that they had a spare empty box room and decided to put a ‚Äúspa‚Äù in it. It was small and the changing rooms were unisex. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable being in the same room as men while I‚Äôm changing.  They don‚Äôt offer any ‚Äúspa‚Äù treatments only a pool two sun beds, a steam room that didn‚Äôt feel like a steam room and a sauna. Would definitely not be booking the spa again as I think it‚Äôs not worth ‚Ç¨25",3,2024,08,05
219,Lovely hotel in Dublin,"The hotel is lovely, the rooms are beautiful and love the old brick in the reception. Staff were all so helpful, Isabel and Victoria on reception were amazing and so friendly. Octavio and Rodrigo were also silver helpful helping me with my bags. Will definitely be back to stay here again.",5,2024,08,05
219,"Great for wheelchair users, friendly and helpful for everyone","As a wheelchair user, I was a little nervous booking accessible accommodation as the standards can vary wildly depending on where you go. However I couldn't be more delighted with my stay at the Address Connolly. Not only was the room/bathroom easily accessible, the staff couldn't do enough to help us. I am blown away by the service we were given, and I hope to see you again soon on my next visit!",5,2024,08,02
219,Room 231,"We arrived really early and expected our room not to be ready. Easy to chat to the lady at reception, she told us where to get a good breakfast and some well needed coffee. Check in came and it was smooth sailing, room was beautiful and had everything we needed to be comfortable. 
The only thing that bothered me was that we asked to use the spa for 1 hour on our last night and were expected to pay the full 25 euros per person. Surely there can be some sort of allowance for people that just want an hour?

Other than that I‚Äôm happy that we got to spend my partners birthday at The Address. They left him a note and brownies, which was really special.

Lastly I  would like to mention Anne, she made our breakfast experience perfect. She always had a smile on her face and was an absolute pleasure to chat to. She goes above and beyond meeting the needs of breakfast patrons. Breakfast is worth the 15 euros per person.

Bronwen and Daniel Room 231",5,2024,08,02
219,Luxury Stay,"Fab room on ninth floor, panoramic view of City, lovely bathroom well equipped with gorgeous toiletries. We rated Isobel on Reception. Only snag was noise from generator, so take earplugs. We loved the amazing art and pictures on the walls. Bar was buzzy and the restaurant was cave like so very cosy.",4,2024,08,01
219,"Not great, pretty disappointing","We checked in on the 24th of July early morning. Booking name Emilee A

I‚Äôm going to start this review saying that the hotel itself is very nice, the building and decor is amazing. Where the experience falls short is some of the staff. We flew from the UK for the weekend, entered the hotel and were greeted by a miserable receptionist, I‚Äôm not sure if the staff read these reviews but the receptionist with red hair had no customer experiences abilities and needs retraining. We were standing at the reception desk to be greeted by the staff to help and the guy stared blank face at us without offering any assistance, we asked if the couple beside us were being served and again no response from the receptionist. We stepped forward to say we were her to check in and the guy flatly said ‚Äòyour rooms not ready yet‚Äô, no greeting or anything. Again, needs some sort of customer service training, this is our first weeekend away together, this was not the greeting we were expecting.

Later in the day on the 25th we had booked in for afternoon tea as per advertised on their website, when going to let them know we were here for our booking the staff had no idea that they offered afternoon tea. We were sent to the wrong section of the hotel and after asking three members of staff who were bewildered by the idea that they offered afternoon tea we found the cafe ourselves, only to be greeted by no staff, even though we were within the open hours. 

This is all I have to say about my experience, there are positives to the hotel such as location, however the negatives far outweigh the positives, if we were to go back to Dublin we would not be staying here again.",2,2024,07,28
219,10/10!!!!,"I recently stayed in the Clayton hotel and I could not recommend this place more!! It was clean, the service was attentive, and its location was wonderful! We especially loved the Lockside bar downstairs and enjoyed the company and quality service provided to us by Cian and Petru. I will rave about this Dublin hotel to everyone that I know going forward :) Cannot wait for our next visit!!!!!!",5,2024,07,27
219,Vacuum Cleaner,"Brilliant hotel, so clean and reasonably priced only thing I don't understand is sitting in the bar at 10:30pm  tonight and hearing a vacuum cleaner not a vibe to be honest. By no means am  saying it was the girls fault most likely just doing as instructed by management!",4,2024,07,27
219,Complaint submitted to Irish Tourist Board,"Myself and 3 friends booked this hotel for 1 night in Dublin to attend Taylor Swift concert, we booked directly on the hotels website 2 x King club rooms and requested 2 twin beds in each room, costing ‚Ç¨200 each

When we arrived at the hotel only 1 room was ready 762, when we entered the room we were greeted with the most foul smell, stale smoke, really overpowering spicy food smell and the room needed aired.  The room also had a largae number of flies.  The room had a balcony so we opened the door to let some air in, the smell in the bathroom was if possible worse.  The balcony was filled with ciggeratte butts.  The cushions & throws also had questionable stains - these were quickly moved to the wardrobe

We then went down to the hotel bar for lunch and spoke to reception on the way past - who advised the hotel was fully booked but they would send someone up to the room. 

 Lunch in the bar was ok, I wouldnt recommend it nor would I visit again, after lunch when we arrived back to the room even with the balcony door open for a few hours the smell was still extremely unpleasant, we spoke to reception again who said again they would send someone up.  By this stage the other room was ready which happened to be directly across the corridor and that room had the exact same foul small, the cushions and throws were also filthy, but the amount of flies in this room was extremely worrying.  Again no staff member had come up so yet another visit to reception, this time they did send someone up and his inital reaction when the door was opened - he coughed at the smell, he went and got sir freshner which masked the small briefly and then we came back with fly spray

When we arrived back from the concert after being out of the rooms all evening when we arrived back, the smell had build up in both rooms again and was worse than we had remembered, we asked for the night porter to come up and he also confirmed the smell.  The smell was unbearable when the bathroom door was closed, showering was impossible as the hot steam seemed to activate the smell and also the towels smelt of the foul smell.  It was a cold, wet night in dublin and we had to sleep with balcony doors open, one of the girls actually slept on the chair beside the balcony door as she couldnt bear the smell.  the beds in both rooms were all of a poor quality, very noisy, broken springs and not comfortable

Breakfast the next morning ‚Ç¨16 per person - dont waste your time or money

On check out we asked reception again to speak to a manager - no one was available we were told the general manager would contact us, only we had paid in full on check in we wouldnt have been paying the full amount.

A few days after check out, I still had no contact from the manager, so I called the hotel and left a message asking for my call to be returned, again no reply, I sent an email, again no reply, followed up with another phone call and another email....no reply

Nearly 2 weeks after I receievd an email from the front office manager to say the general manager was off on leave and my complaint would be fully investigated and in regards to my comments on the soft furnishings and the condition of the furniture and the beds, not being of the expectation of the King room - we werent actaully assigned king rooms, we were assigned twin rooms as we had requested twin beds

Now I have travelled enough to know that in every hotel room every bed can convert to 2 twin beds and the hooks were on the bottom of the beds in both rooms - so not only was the condition of the rooms below standard we were assigned rooms which were below the standard of room we had paid for

I sent a reply to the email from the front office manager again no reply, I called and left a message and no call back was made to me,  I have today submitted a formal complaint to Failte Ireland the Irish tourist board

I would not recommend this hotel",1,2024,07,23
219,Looking forward to my next visit.,"I have stayed in this hotel a few different times for work. Every time I have been here I have found the place to be spotlessly clean. All the staff I have met during my visits are great, very helpful and friendly and can't do enough to help. I was given a lovely room on the 9th floor with views of the Dublin skyline. Keep up the good work.
I look forward to my next visit",5,2024,07,18
219,The Address Hotel Dublin,"Great rooms with excellent coffee machine for a cup of expresso first thing in the morning
Very comfy linen in bed which was extra huge!!!
Extremely clean with very good bathroom facilities 
Conveniently positioned next to Connolly station so you can catch the tram around the city.
We stayed here twice within a week because we were touring Ireland. The only thing perhaps to improve was the room on our second visit was on floor seven and the bathroom smelled bad in the evening of all the kitchen smells coming through the bathroom fan which was quite unpleasant 
However the smell had gone in the moor gin and didn‚Äôt creep into the room itself
All in all a convenience t and friendly place to stay 
Attentive staff always helpful",5,2024,07,18
219,The Address Connolly Dublin,This hotel was very nice to stay in after coming in from a long overnight flight. When we arrived the check in staff were friendly and gave us easy to follow instructions. This hotel also served a very good breakfast. The only thing I would say is that it is not very close to the center of the city. It is a little bit but not terribly. Still a good hotel!!,4,2024,07,16
219,Night in Dublin,"We booked a last minute overnight to Dublin & chose this hotel. We parked in Connolly station car park for ‚Ç¨9.50 for 1 day, 4 minute walk to the hotel. The hotel itself is really nice, warm, nice decor, helpful staff (except the manager on reception). We thought it was a great deal only to learn upon checking in the spa was not included in our stay, that this would be an additional ‚Ç¨25 per person. I went onto the website and it states if you book the spa online it is ‚Ç¨20 pp so we tried to do that however couldn‚Äôt find an option to. We called reception and the lady we spoke to asked us to come to reception and she would honour this ‚Ç¨20pp however when my partner arrived at reception the lady apologised as the manager was there and would not give us the rate or advise how we could book online. So please be clear the website is wrong, you need to add the spa at the time of booking to get the ‚Ç¨20 per person offer. The spa looked nice, nothing special, it was empty probably because people do not want to pay this additional charge as any other hotel includes this in the overall booking fee. I am put off returning to this hotel given the attitude of the manager. I have read other reviews on here with regards to his attitude!",3,2024,07,13
219,Helpful Staff,"Enjoyed the atmosphere of the The Address Connolly, tucked away literally under a bridge! The staff were nice and accommodating. Really enjoyed meeting Kirstie at breakfast. She was charming and welcoming. She provided us with several great suggestions of places to visit while in Dublin. We looked forward to chatting with her each morning at breakfast!",5,2024,07,08
219,Guest service,We stayed at the Address and the hotel was beautiful. He rooms were beautiful and the food was excellent. Ahmed helped us out so much. His attention to detail was superb and his friendliness really added to our stay. We will most definitely be back very soon.,5,2024,07,06
219,Lovely Experience,"I would highly recommend The Address Hotel, I can‚Äôt say enough about my experience. The hotel is beautiful, with comfortable rooms and fantastic amenities. The staff were very helpful especially Ahmet who went above and beyond to ensure my stay was perfect. I will recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5,2024,07,05
219,Shocking !,"The following description is what we found right and wrong at your hotel. The receptionist was pleasant on arrival. But found there was a lack of information. We were in the club lounge room and the roof top area wasn't mentioned or the option of the spa etc. We had to ask about the safe in the room and WiFi code. When we arrived we was disappointed with the view and the noise of the frequent trains passing by. We decided not to complain as the room itself was clean,  the bed was massive and very comfy. Good TV and chocolate and fresh water on arrival. The chairs in the room where torn or broken.  But the bathroom was our main concern. The shower dail was missing the top and the panel creaked when in the shower and was glued with yellow silicone and the enamel of the bath was chipped and sharp so had to mind you didn't catch your feet on it.  The bath fan squeals when the light is switched on.
The service we received was fantastic from some and atroshious from others. The house keeping missed us on 2 days we had to ask for extra tea and milk and toilet rolls and two occasions. We was informed breakfast was too 11am but on Monday breakfast finished at 10am so was rushed to finish. But what was most shocking was what we witnessed while waiting for the lift from the breakfast room! 4 members of staff 2 maintenance staff and 2 spa staff where retching at the state of the blocked toilet and shower units and swearing say that f##king disgusting. It didn't even deter them when I coughed and saw us standing there ! They just carried on. This is suppose to be a 4 star hotel and I believe that the room and the service we received was far from 4 star. 
After talking to the manager and showed photos of the room to him and him just saying that it is 4 stars but apologies for the service, I was advised to email you to express how very unsatisfied I am.",2,2024,07,01
219,Will definitely stay here again and again,"Amazing hotel in a great location.
We upgraded to have access to the rooftop lounge (was perfect being able to grab a tea or coffee to take with us when going out) and spa access and that was definitely worth it. Gym and spa were great, had a really nice relaxing few mornings there, and that was perfectly topped off with a great breakfast (those sausages are worth staying here alone!).
Really friendly staff.
We will always choose to stay here when visiting Dublin.",5,2024,07,01
219,Chivalry is alive and kickin at The Address :),"Fantastic hotel!  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  Brilliant service from start to finish!  The room was lovely with a comfy bed and fantastic shower.  Iron facilities are also available too which was great.  I have to say a special thank you to the barman who looked after me after I had a bit of a tumble ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ  He was so lovely and attentive and even walked myself and my friend back to the room to make sure we got in safe and sound. He was an absolute gentleman. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt catch his name due to my drunken stupor lol but I really hope my thank you gets back to him.  I will most definitely book again, hopefully I‚Äôll be a little bit better behaved next time haha!  Thank you all so very much ü•∞ x",5,2024,06,30
219,Amazing,"The room was clean and cosy, the location was perfect as it was close to the centre. The room service was great. The staff were all nice, kind and very helpful, especially Rub√©n. The gym and spa were very clean and nice. I would definitely stay there next time.",5,2024,06,30
219,Great experience,"Stayed here with a friend for a Taylor Swift concert and loved it. The room was gorgeous, spa was so amazing and relaxing, and staff, especially Isabel at reception, were so friendly and helpful. Would absolutely stay here again and recommend to a friend.",5,2024,06,29
219,SO happy with our stay.,"We had a lovely experience without complaints. Our room was truly comfortable. Isabel at the front desk was EXCEPTIONAL! She made us feel so welcome, and went out of her way to assist us. We would gladly stay here again on a future visit to Dublin.",5,2024,06,28
219,Rubbish hotel,"Will never stay there again,  stayed in room 343 for 3 nights, it was 10 feet away from the train tracks, trains going past every 5 minutes,  tv was useless, about 30 channels and 15 of them were news channels, mini fridge was also usless as it wasn't even cold,  at ‚Ç¨200 a night I would really have expected more,  also the tv has audio description on it that can't be turned off,  the porter said the tv comes like that, rubbish, crap hotel.",1,2024,06,27
219,**LATE REVIEW** Feeling at home at The Address! A home away from home... but better!,"**PLEASE NOTE: This is a retrospective review about my stay at The Address Connolly. Late upload due to unexpected loss of device and losing access to previous account. Sadly I no longer have the photos taken of my last stay at The Address** 

Without doubt, the staff at The Address Connolly went out of their way to make me feel welcome and at home during my last stay.

When I first arrived at The Address, I was running earlier than usual and was - in fact - roo early to check in. This was entirely my fault as I failed to notify the staff of my early arrival but the team made this feel like no issue whatsoever. The Reception team offered to take my luggage and to keep it secure for me until I could check in whilst simultaneously escorting me through to the beautiful bar area and seating me. The staff were wonderfully empathetic, showing fantastic emotional intelligence, by asking me how my journey went, and reassuring me that there was no need to apologise for my early arrival, sensing that my long journey (2 flights and a long layover) may have been exhausting.

No sooner had I ordered my second drink in the atmospheric and serene 'The Place' bar, than a member of the hotel team came over to my table to advise that my room had been prepared early for me to head up and deposit my bags, enjoy a relaxing shower, and to begin exploring Dublin City. Given that I was still a couple of hours too early to check in, I ask the team member if they had made a special effort for me even though it was my error in showing up early. They advised me that it was no problem for them at all, even though I learned that the housekeeping team  had specifically attended my room upon learning that I had arrived early. I had no expectation that this would happen on my account but I was blown away by this effort and gesture.

Honestly, I can only compare the welcome I received at The Address Connolly to the feeling of heading home to visit family at Christmas... I was almost asking ""whose address is this anyway?!"" Even the way that the team members interacted with each other gave the feeling of such a strong and cohesive bond of care and respect for each other on the team AS WELL AS the guests! Though The Address is a fantastically modern and stylish hotel, the welcoming atmosphere is nothing short of warm and homely.

At this stage, I had only been at the hotel for a couple of hours and I already knew that The Address was an establishment of the highest standards with a genuine love and care for customer service.

I was shown to my room by a young man who I  believe was new to the team. As we headed up in the lift, he was keen to ask me how well I knew Dublin, and gave me the ""insider/local secrets"" of the best places to experience Dublin's nightlife and even told me some of the 'big name' places which I want to avoid due to them being too touristy. I massively appreciated this as I have visited Dublin several times over the years but I always love to check out new places, so it was great to hear about bars with the best live music etc (in the opinion of a Dublin native!).

An unexpected surprise during my stay at The Address was being granted access to the exclusive rooftop bar with fantastic views across Dublin. If you've never visited Dublin before, the great thing about terraces in Dublin is that you'll usually have a brilliant view of the city due to the absence of skyscrapers.

Throughout the duration of my five-night stay at The Address Connolly, every single member of the team who I had the pleasure of interacting with were the utmost professionals and took great pride and happiness in their work. It just goes to show that choosing the RIGHT PEOPLE for a job is the best way to ensure that your business's values will reach the clientele... The Address have clearly employed a team of individuals who genuinely care about their role(s) in the hospitality sector and providing an unforgettable experience for their guests.

Whether it was the reception team, the night porters, the housekeeping team, or the bar and restaurant staff, it seemed that absolutely nothing was too much of a request or an inconvenience for The Address team. A wonderful team who seem like a family and who treat their guests like family too.

The room itself which I was allocated was gorgeous, far exceeding my expectations. The floor-to-ceiling windows, combined with a luxurious and comfortable king size bed, and the wall-mounted fixtures, gave the bedroom a sleek, modern, and bright character. I drifted off to sleep in absolute comfort each night and cannot fault the room in any way. Of course, every day, the housekeeping team did a fantastic job of making the bed and left the room in an immaculate condition for me, without fail. I appreciate this so much.

Recently, I called The Address to enquire about another stay. I spoke with Daniel on the Reception team who was fantastically helpful and talked me through the packages on offer for the dates I requested.

Final word: If you want to be treated well by a team of wonderful professionals and to be accommodated in a beautiful, bright, airy room, YOU MUST STAY AT THE ADDRESS CONNOLLY!",5,2024,06,26
219,Highly recommend a stay here,"Had a great time here with my young family recently- the staff were amazing- especially Ruben who went above and beyond when we had a bit of a problem with flights/ taxis etc. Great location, right in the middle of the city. Couldn't recommend enough!",5,2024,06,26
219,Concierge man needs to sort his attitude out !!!,"Lovely room we stayed in on the 9th floor , lovely building , One thing that got us really mad was the attitude of the concierge man upon arriving back to the hotel to be greeted with ROOM KEY ROOM KEY ROOM KEY and been made to feel like we wasn‚Äôt welcome back or belong there , no manners whatsoever and a real bad attitude, he definitely needs to work on his front of house skills !!! We won‚Äôt be back in a hurry !",3,2024,06,25
219,Group stay,"We stayed here for one night, the staff here were super friendly, the room was perfect and had air conditioning which was needed as it warm, the breakfast buffet was very nice and had the usual breakfast items for a fry up and cereals and pastries and a variety of juices.",5,2024,06,24
219,June 2024,"Recently returned from this amazing hotel, very well located from tourist places, and the staff was very frindly, a big thank you to Ruben who ensured a perfect stay!

He recommend me places to visit and where you can eat or drink something. He helped me at all times making me feel at home.

I will comeback and recommend this hotel for the best customer service.",5,2024,06,24
219,Poor food,"Had the misfortune of ordering fish and chips for lunch on Monday 17th June.  Both the Fish and chips were seriously hard, dry and over cooked.  Very poor.

Service was good. I have tried communicating with the and get intercepted by the AI bot.  Please refund or voucher  obyrnejc@gmail.com",1,2024,06,20
219,DO  NOT STAY HERE WITH IMMIGRANTS,"DO NOT STAY HERE!

The neighbourhood is sketchy with roadworks outside the hotel. There are immigrants staying the hotel with children running around, it doesn‚Äôt feel safe and we were not warned about this. I was shocked to learn this from a 4* Star ‚Äòluxury‚Äô hotel. Our twin room was alright however the window did not open, which is lucky as the tram stopped right outside! The noise of the trains & trams was very loud at night. The staff seemed pleasant, the lifts rarely worked and the corridors smelt of sewage. The Food in the restaurant 'the only way is North' was lovely and the staff did seem polite and friendly. We booked 3 rooms for 2 nights and if I had known about the above situation I would have stayed elsewhere, where we felt safe and clean. I feel I have been tricked into sharing a hotel with immigrants! I am shocked and stunned and will not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!",1,2024,06,18
219,Customer Service Isabel in Reception,"Me n my friend were traveling around Ireland for 10 days  first we arrived at Dublin airport very very early  and we stayed At The Address .I really need to highlight the warm welcome received by a Spanish lady her name Isabel , she kindly stored our bags and we went for breakfast at the hotel ,
Then we decided to explore the city center ,  when we got back just before 3 pm we went to the rooms we were upgraded to club rooms on the 8 th floor with panoramic views , beds super comfy the only down thing was room extractor a bit noisy at night. On check out she booked us a taxi and we went to pick up our rental car to continue our trip . Definitely recommend it.",5,2024,06,17
219,Best experience in the The Address Conolly,"I went to this amazing hotel, with my friend, s√∫per close to the touristic places, the staff in the hotel very friendly, Isabel in  the recepci√≥n she was s√∫per friendly, she help us with the check in and she recommend us places to eat and places to visit, the room we stayed on was clean and the beds s√∫per comfortables, the restaurant was very tasty and with a good variation of food!,i really recommend this Hotel and i Will surely comback.",5,2024,06,17
219,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I came with a group of 7 People to visit Ireland,  the Hotel is peculiar it have a train passing from reception, in one of the room we stayed in the floor 7, we have a balcony so we couldn't hear the train,I have to stand out Isabel from Navarra the recepcionist she was s√∫per kind and helpful, we feeled like we staying home.
I really recommend this hotel, Best costumer service ever.",5,2024,06,17
219,Amazing stay!!,Amazing stay!!! Our room was amazing with the softest pillows I've ever used!! The hotel was very clean and smelled amazing!! ALL of the workers were wonderful and so kind! Huge shout out to Isabel who went above and beyond to make our stay amazing! Ebrahim was helpful and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed! I can not say enough great things about this hotel!! We will definitely be back! Thank you so much for everything!!‚ù§Ô∏è,5,2024,06,14
219,Once in a lifetime trip,Isabel was such a warm and friendly welcome. We loved our conversations with her. We truly loved our stay and would come back any time. Azura from the restaurant staff was amazing. Everyone is so kind and helpful. The food is delicious and the whole experience was unforgettable.,5,2024,06,14
219,Good and bad,The location is suspect esp at night. Good room but the a/c fixed too warm esp when you consider the top sheet is part of a doomer. It seems almost all UK hotels in the 3/4 star range are afflicted this way. Dinner here is great with daily specials. Serving staff in this part of the hotel are professional. Didn‚Äôt have any exposure to checkin staff. Biggest problem we had was breakfast. It‚Äôs in the dark and dingy basement and will not open before 7 am. Doors lock you out just so you don‚Äôt get a head start.,4,2024,06,12
219,Incredible help in medical distress,"My travel nebulizer broke the day before I arrived.  Eoin and Shreya found a replacement, picked it up, and arranged for my payment‚Ä¶while I was touring Dublin. 
Sincere thanks to the best customer service and empathy I have ever encountered!",5,2024,06,12
219,Great experience!,I stayed at the hotel and my experience was perfect. The hotel is very well located and the rooms are very comfortable. I would like to thank Ruben who was very attentive to me and helped me as much as he could. If I come back to Dublin I will stay here again for sure.,5,2024,06,11
219,Best and Worst of Address Hotel Connolly,"The staff at the Address Hotel Connolly were exceptional; kind, welcoming, and accommodating.  The food at the restaurant North was absolutely fantastic, as well as the restaurant staff.  

The rooms were undesirable.  Our room smelled terribly of cigarette smoke, as if it was coming out of the air conditioning vents.  The bed I slept in was miserably uncomfortable, sagging in the middle as if it were many years old.  

The hotel is conveniently located near the train station, and right in the heart of Dublin.  ",3,2024,06,11
219,Service needs improvement,"Just came back from holidays in Europe and this was probably the least I've enjoyed an experience in a hotel. The facilities are quite modern for its price point, but on the other hand the neighborhood doesn't feel like the safest. On the positive side I would highlight that my wife and I were attended by a Brazilian woman in the front desk (that I can't recall the name) that was really lovely and helpful, supporting us arranging tours, giving really valuable tips, scheduling taxi rides, etc. But the main reason for my overall bad experience is the staff, mainly the ones in charge of breakfast. The food was good, but people there really lack the hospitality basic skills to deal with customers. Just to give you one example, the utensils are placed in tables individually, and are not available in a box or somewhere else if you need them. Well, the table that was assigned to us was missing fork for my wife's seat, in that clearly one of the other guests simply took it. That type of thing happens and should be easy to fix in any restaurant/hotel in the world. But she approached one of the staff members, who was really defensive and quite sarcastic towards her, and my wife had to insist to have a simple fork to eat her breakfast. That is not a good start of the day for a person that really anticipates the holidays and just want to relax. Like I said, this is just one example of the environment there to illustrate how people clearly lack training to deal with customers.",3,2024,06,10
219,Welcoming and Helpful Staff,We arrived from Melbourne on the 6th of may and we got to the hotel where Isabel checked us in. She was extremely nice and helpful with everything. We were checked into room 9 with amazing panoramic views. We decided to pay for access to the spa and was worth every penny. The hydro pool and sauna were brilliant. The whole trip was made even better thanks to Isabel‚Äôs restaurants/ bar recommendations.,5,2024,06,09
219,Amazing,Amazing place!! The rooms are very nice and the service is excellent! Chirag from the staff and Tais from the North restaurant were so kind and helpfull to me and my family through our stay! Looking foward to comming back again in the future!!,5,2024,06,09
219,Amazing front of house staff,"Isabel (front  of house staff ) goes way beyond for all guests.  Kind,  efficient, nothing was too much trouble.  Her local knowledge , ability to source medical assistance for guests whom were unwell.  No matter what challenges were presented to her she dealt with them with an incredible positive attitude making our stay a happy memorable one",4,2024,06,09
219,Just brilliant!,I have stayed here 4 times and I highly recommend The Address. The staff are wonderful- especially Isabella at the front desk who always remembers me and always has a lovely smile on her face! The business rooms are fantastic as is the restaurant which had a brilliant menu! I‚Äôll be back next week - can‚Äôt wait!,5,2024,06,08
219,Great place with amazing staff,"Great place to stay and the staff is amazing. Ahmet who works there as a butler is amazing. He was very friendly, kind, and helpful. He made my stay much better as he was able to suggest some fun activities in the city. I will definitely be returning soon and I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,06,07
219,Greate experience,"Literally in the center of Dublin, you can walk everywhere from there. Absolutely crazy location and then you walk into the building and it's so peaceful. The Address Club Lounge is absolutely lovely with a spectacular view of Connolly Railway Station. A very special thank you to Isabel for being so wonderful and offering us early access to our room plus a free room upgrade. After a busy day visiting tourist places, we spent a few moments in the sauna and pool. Overall, excellent experience. Highly recommended.",5,2024,06,07
219,Remarkable Staff and Great Location,We stayed for 4 nights and was really impressed with all of the staff but in particular Isabel. She checked us into our room and was amazing with us. She recommended places to visit and restaurants/pubs to go to. The experience visiting Dublin was incredible.,5,2024,06,05
219,Wonderful experience in the Address Hotel,"I had a wonderful experience in The Address Hotel, staff super friendly. One lady Isabel was super helpful, she checked in my family and I and explained to us with the map how to go to the city centre and gave us information about the the best tourist spots in Dublin. The restaurant and the breakfast buffet was amazing, very tasty. The room we stayed in no. 8 was very clean, the beds are super comfy and the view was amazing.",5,2024,06,04
219,Great Experience!,"Our experience at the hotel has been wonderful. It is very well located, with large and comfortable rooms, and the staff is extremely friendly. Special mention goes to Ruben for his kindness and friendliness. He was attentive to us at all times, recommending places we should visit, places to eat, and pubs to go to. All of his recommendations were spot on. It‚Äôs a pleasure to have employees like him. We will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,06,04
219,Amazing experience,"Loved my stay in here! From the moment I arrived till my departure, I was very well taken care of with lovely energy from the staff, special shoutout to Ruben! I have already recommended this place to my friends and will definitely come back!!",5,2024,05,30
219,Above & Beyond!,"We chose The Address Connolly in Dublin for its central location and easy access to everything, but it was a member of the Front Desk staff that truly made our stay memorable! Shreya went above and beyond to recommend  and book some of the best Indian and Thai restaurants in Dublin. Be sure to ask for her if you every stay at The Addresss Connolly!",4,2024,05,30
219,Stay at address Connely,"Room and staff were clean and friendly.  Rodrigo went above and beyond. I am not a coffee drinker, but I had 3 cups. He was very attentive and made sure all our needs were met. The hotel was very centrally located. The restaurant within the hotel was convenient and the food was delicious.",5,2024,05,29
219,Mid level hotel that tries to play above that and doesnt succeed,"The room was too hot and it was only 62 degrees outside. We were told ""It's Ireland, we dont have good air conditioning"" by the front desk. I cant imagine it in the summer! The place is somewhat run down. Breakfast gets crowded and service is limited. Gym is decent. Other permanent residents are also present at the hotel.",3,2024,05,28
219,Loved my first visit at The Address Connolly ,"I have to start with the staff. Each member we interacted with, they were all fantastic. A special thank you to Isabel from Reception, she welcomed us with an amazing energy and for going beyond to accommodate our request for a room change as the first room we were assigned was facing the train tracks, the new room on the 8th floor had an amaizing viewü•∞.
The rooms are equipped with good up to date technology, air con and room service.
We stayed at the Address Connolly Hotel for the Bruce Springsteen concert and the experience was fantastic. Definitely will be back in our next trip to Ireland.üáÆüá™ ",5,2024,05,27
219,Great service & comfortable stay.,"The hotel is modern, well appointed & is centrally located. Great breakfasts and I enjoyed a lovely dinner (roast of the day) one evening in the restaurant. Shout out to Ahmet who was particularly helpful - great customer service! 
Very comfortable stay thanks.",4,2024,05,26
219,Horrible stay. Stay away!!!!,"This was so upsetting. This hotel should focus on satisfying their guests rather than trying to be cutting edge and carbon efficient. . I like a cold room. And when it‚Äôs 20c outside I expect the room to be cooler.  The air conditioning randomly stopped during our stay. We called the front desk and they didn‚Äôt answer the phone. I went down to the front desk to discuss the room temp. The night manager brought a cooler but it didn‚Äôt help. My wife and I got no sleep because the room was 26c. When I went down the next morning to discuss compensation for the horrible room and lack of sleep from the uncomfortable temperatures the day manager caught an attitude and told me that there was nothing wrong and that hes not going to do anything about it. The elevator areas have a bad stench. The staff is rude. The rooms are way, way over priced for not being anywhere near temple bar, the restaurant is price gouging, the rooms are hot and the showers have a halfwall that doesn‚Äôt block the water from getting on the floor. This was horrible and I will never stay at this hotel again.  I wouldn‚Äôt stay here if I were you.",1,2024,05,23
219,Fantastic Hotel,"Excellently appointed hotel.
Exceptional front of house staff. A special mention to Isabel who couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. She was a total joy..
Well located - with taxi & tram services directly opposite the hotel.
About a 20 minute walk into the main city centre - this is easily achievable.
The restaurant has a wide range of food options. Great ambiance for a late night drink as well.",4,2024,05,22
219,Great staff=great experience!,"We feel at home. The rooms are cozy and very comfortable.
But I would like to highlight the treatment of the staff, especially Rub√©n, who was very attentive to us and helped us with everything we needed. A 10 out of 10. If we return to Dublin, we will definitely repeat!",5,2024,05,21
219,"Bed, Isabel and tech .. a great choice","The hotel is all very high tech, which is very funny for adults to feel like child‚Äôs again. The best of all the experience was the kindness and availability of the staff - Isabel is the best really ! She is the receptionist who will guarantee you have the best time. 
The hotel has also a good Irish breakfast, and really the best bed of all times. Can I bring the bed home ? 
Nice choice !",5,2024,05,19
219,Excellent stay,"Wonderful stay with great staff, specifically Tiaris at the front desk. The club on the 7th floor was perfect for coffee in the morning or a reading spot to watch the sunset in the afternoon. This is the perfect place to stay when visiting Dublin.",5,2024,05,17
219,Great travel experience,"Wonderful and Convenient location.  Next to the Luas and Connolly Station.  A short walk to Connolly Street. Would stay again while in Dublin. 

The staff, including g Daniel Slireyc was very attentive to our needs. The restaurant was convenient for dinner and drinks.",5,2024,05,17
219,Poor Service and Unpleasant Experience - The worst hotel experience I have ever had,"My recent stay at the Address Connolly was a complete letdown, primarily due to the abysmal customer service, notably from front of house manager Feargal. From the moment we walked in, the welcome was anything but warm; it felt cold and transactional.  There were no pleasantries, not even a smile.
 
Upon requesting an ice bucket and glasses for the room, the response was lackluster at best. Without even bothering to look up, his response was ""the bar"" with no further guidance.  I probed for direction on how to get there and went to fetch it myself.  Furthermore, there was no information was provided about our stay amenities like room details, WiFi, or breakfast, Feargal seemed indifferent and uninformative.  
 
I had contacted the hotel both via email and phone prior to our visit and purchased a cheeseboard and chocolate covered strawberries.  I spoke to a lovely lady on the phone explaining our exact time of arrival and requested that the gifts be in the room for our arrival, she assured me a note would be added about this.  My reason for this was we would only have a 90 minutes before leaving to attend a concert.

We arrived in the room to find these absent.  I called down to reception and had yet another disheartening conversation with Feargal.  I explained my disappointment and that we would not be staying in the hotel for long before heading to a concert, therefore could not wait long on it arriving.  I asked if I could have a refund or have the money I spent transferred to cover breakfast.   His demeanor was unapologetic and cold and he refused to refund or transfer the money.  He assured me the food would be up in 5 minutes and said that the reason this was not done was because they would never leave fresh food in a room with no guests.  I understand this reasoning however I tried to explain that I had been assured this would be there by a member of staff for my husbands arrival when I called beforehand.  

When the waiter arrived, he dropped some of the crackers and cheese on the floor in front of us, he then proceeded to pick them up and set them on the board without acknowledgment or apology and left the room. We were quite frankly shocked.
 
I had to call the waiter back from the hall and I explained very clearly that we would not like to eat food that has been on the floor.  Even when we pointed out the dropped food to the waiter, their response was dismissive and he just pointed to the food that had not been dropped and said ""but this is clean"". He eventually took the dirty food in his hand away from the room.

My husband then went to the front desk to raise this issue and yet again was met by none other than helpful Feargal. This interaction was yet again unapologetic and there was a severe lack of understanding as to why this service was disappointing.  Feargal said he would speak to the waiter and said there was probably a language barrier, he also said a replacement would be sent up.  By this stage we had an hour left before we had to leave.
 
We waited the hour, no replacement arrived so we then left our hotel room to attend the concert we had tickets for. We walked past the front desk and Feargal was no longer there.  When we returned around 11, we were greeted with the stench of blue cheese as the replacement cheeseboard had arrived that had been left sitting in our room for what was clearly hours.  Despite Feargal previously explaining to us that fresh food would not be put in a room with no guests. I cannot confirm if this one had been dropped on the floor and then put back for us to eat. Needless to say we did not eat the soft crackers and hardened cheese. 
 
Upon check out, I was met by Eoin and I requested to speak to someone to make a complaint.  He said he would get Feargal, I requested to speak to someone else as it was pointless making a complaint to Feargal about himself.  I was told, there was no one else.  When Feargal approached I also asked him who I could speak to, he explained that there was no-one above him, not anyone that would have any affect on his front desk anyway. He came across as entitled and as though he thought he was untouchable.  As you can imagine, this interaction was completely frustrating and so disheartening as an end to our overnight stay that was supposed to be special.  

When I raised the point of his customer service and how we were not made to feel welcome, he comment was ""I just check you in, if you are expecting me to move heaven and earth to welcome you then you are mistaken"".

When going over yet again the issue of the purchased gifts we were unable to eat, he argued with me that I was lying when I explained we waited an hour for the replacement.  This was completely disrespectful and unprofessional.  I requested a refund as we were not able to eat what I had purchased, he said there would categorically be no refund.  I purchased a service and was not provided with it when in the room as previously agreed and explained multiple times.  This is against basic consumer regulations.
 
In summary, my experience at The Address Connolly was marred by poor customer service, unwelcoming demeanor, and a lack of accountability. It's clear that hospitality and guest satisfaction are not priorities here, leaving much to be desired for future patrons.  I honestly have never experienced ""customer service"" like it.  It tainted our entire stay, something that was supposed to be a celebration.  Despite expressing our willingness to give the hotel an opportunity to rectify the situation on multiple occasions, there was no genuine effort to make amends or even offer a basic apology.",1,2024,05,08
219,"Nice staff, TERRIBLE location! Book somewhere else.","I would have given the rating of one star except the front desk staff were very nice and helpful, as was the doorman and bartender in the pub. And that is where the positives for this hotel end. 
-This hotel is located in the ""Northside"" which apparently is the less desirable part of Dublin. It is in a VERY BAD and dangerous location, across from the Connolly Train station (which should have been the first red flag). Junkies, druggies, homeless people are steps away from the entrance to this hotel. The front desk recommended a local pub ""just a short walk away"",and it was a downright scary one. Our Aer Lingus travel agent booked us here and I am not sure the reason as they knew we arrived by car. The car park is located blocks away of which you must walk under the train overpass, where the homeless encampment is, smelling of urine. The hotel does not offer any kind of assistance with parking. You must then download the parking app or visit the website. I was unable to do either from my phone, but the front desk was wonderful in helping us. One evening, a young woman collapsed in front of the hotel. The emergency personnell arrived on scene and it appeared she was dead. Not sure, but didnt stay around enough to find out. It was very upsetting. 

-Although the lobby looks recently renovated with an urban vibe, the rooms are very small, and bathroom tiny.  But the worst part was the odor, and the noise from the overhead train. The room smelled of stale cigarette smoke, and one evening the smoke was pouring in from the vent in the soffitt.  There were so many loud pigeons on the balcony they could be heard through the closed window, not to mention the train. 
-There is also a  population of refugees that live in this hotel. Two young boys proudly announced they had lived there for 2 years. 

All in all, I am positive that you can find a much better option in Dublin.",2,2024,05,07
219,Great staff,"Great location, the club rooms are worth it, huge and great to have access to the business lounge with views. Isabel was great on the front desk, so welcoming, full of knowledge and a little ray of light. Breakfast was okay, the ingredients were lower quality than I would have liked, e.g. the juices. The temperatures of the sauna and spa were also a little cool.",4,2024,04,28
219,Isabel was a tourist's angel!,"We got in from an overnight flight around 5am and were exhausted. Isabel took us under her wing and helped us get oriented. She arranged for a room to be ready for us by 11am, directed us to breakfast and a place to buy a couple of electrical adapters - we brought the wrong ones. She even charged my phone while we waited for Dublin to wake up.
Our room - two twin beds - was comfortable,, roomy, with 2 comfortable beds. The sheets were shorted, but we pulled the bedding apart for our comfort. Housecleaning staff were delightful - as were all the people we met in Dublin.
Hotel location was on the fringe of the busy part of town, but as 2 female senior citizens, we had no trouble walking or taking public transportation.
Overall- Isabel set the bar for our Dublin experience and we cannot thank her enough!",5,2024,04,26
219,Boys trip away,"Great stay at the hotel. Staff were friendly, breakfast was very good. Used the gym facilities which were decent. Only issue was when we moved the beds and found rubbish underneath so no sure how clean some places were. However didn‚Äôt after a good stay",4,2024,04,25
219,Bad for Business,"The hotel itself is quite new with and the club room was a good size.
The staff at reception especially Fearghal look as though they don't want to be there. 
Swarms of people at check in with plastic bags of laundry at reception, not sure these were guests either it seemed strange.

I asked could they print a document for me and sent to the email given. I sat there for 25 minutes at 7.30 am while reception was quiet. Staff chatted among themselves while I waited and in the end I just left and found an internet cafe.
At check in I asked could I have a business invoice and gave the company details, no problem I will update the system was the reply.
Checked out this morning and wasn't surprised to see they hadn't bothered.",1,2024,04,25
219,Don't stay here,I had high hopes for this hotel but sad to say that it did not even come close to meeting expectations. First off let me say that it's in a really rough neighborhood. During the day it was not too bad but at night it's a whole different story. The hotel itself looked as though it's been recently remodeled for the most part. It has a boutique vibe but that's about where the good vibe ends. Our room was so small that we could barely walk around the bed. We travel extensively and I have to say that it's easily the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed. When we entered the room it was boiling hot inside and the SMELL! It seriously smelt like a someone had died in there. The HVAC system didn't work and we had to call several time to try and get it fixed. Very frustrating. There was a huge dark red stain on the floor with red spatter on the drapes that made me very nervous as well. When I return to Ireland I would definitely find another place to stay.,1,2024,04,23
219,Special service from Shreya and Daniel!,"This is my third visit to Dublin.  The city has many unique characteristics, is rich in history and most importantly is fun.  

Special thanks to Shreya and Daniel at the front desk!  Both provided friendly and efficient service during our stay.  They exceeded our expectations in every way!   Thank you both",5,2024,04,05
219,Lacking atmosphere & poor customer care,"Spent 3 night in Dublin with friends. Changes made to the number of rooms booked by the group with first notification being on arrival!
Manager unhelpful. 
Room clean with comfortable bed. Would be helpful to supply bottles of water in the rooms to avoid trekking downstairs. 
Hotel lacked atmosphere and no visible signs to promote you were in Dublin in the heart of Ireland.
The thing that would put me off revisiting again was that one of the party had an unauthorised credit card transaction made 3 hours after leaving hotel, with no prior notice that a charge was due.
Going by the welcome in other shops, tourist attractions, bars and restaurants I'm sure there will be far better places to stay in Dublin than this hotel.",2,2024,04,04
219,Wouldn‚Äôt Return,"A nice hotel with shocking customer service. As a large group we encountered a problem with a double booking at check in.  Whilst I appreciate these things happen the manner in which this complaint was dealt with was unacceptable.  As a result we chose not eat or drink in the hotel, this would be to our benefit as we found amazing pubs and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel itself. 

We stayed three nights at the hotel and on arrival paid for our rooms. During this time I was not made aware of any problem, on check out when I personally handed in our room keys I was still not made aware of any problem. However some three hours after checking out, whilst at the airport, my card provider messaged to say The Address Connolly had taken a payment from my debit card of ‚Ç¨100. After several calls to the hotel I was able to establish that there had been a shortage in payment for our room, a mistake made again by the hotel. Whilst I am happy to pay the room difference I was furious that this card payment was taken without my prior knowledge or authorisation, this should have been dealt with during the time we stayed at the hotel or at time of check out. There was and has not been any communication from the hotel either to myself or the person with whom the booking had been made. Bearing in mind the original double booking wasn‚Äôt notified either to us prior to our arrival at the hotel. If your staying or going to stay at the Address Connolly enjoy your stay but please be aware that the manager of this hotel has zero customer service skills.",2,2024,04,03
219,First time in Ireland,Very friendly staff and quick to accommodate special requests. We did not choose this hotel but it was assigned by the tour company that arranged our travel to Ireland. But we would certainly go back. Special thanks to Isabel for the warm and welcoming help at checkin and during our stay.,4,2024,03,30
219,Lovely Stay!!,Everything was perfect! Isabel in reception was very friendly and helpful! Definitely we're coming back!! Lovely lovely lovely!!! The Room was perfectly tied and the breakfast had loads of options and the staff were very helpful as well!,5,2024,03,30
219,Don't miss the spa!,"Loved the spa, I was not expecting such a high quality experience but it was just what I needed. Reception service was great as well, Daniel specifically was very helpful and got me sorted out in no time. I'll definitely consider going back when I get a chance.",5,2024,03,27
219,Go for the Club Room!,My daughter and I stayed 2 nights (a few days apart) at the Address Connolly and really enjoyed the hotel.  We upgraded to the club room and found it worth it.  The room was much nicer and the beds super comfortable.  We enjoyed the spa.  Breakfast was very nice.  We had a problem with our room on the second night.  (Strong cigarette smell) but the front desk was very accommodating and gave us a. new and better room.  We found the location to be convenient too.,5,2024,03,16
219,"Poor Customer Attitude, Disappointing Experience","Very disappointing experience with Front Office service. 

There was a problem with a vent in the ceiling of my premier king room that made a large constant noise throughout the night, I noticed this on arrival back to the hotel around 12:30 and raised it with reception who sent a a gentleman up to inspect it, after inspecting and recording the noise for 5 minutes, he said the only option was to move me rooms, at this point I had fully unpacked, and was a solo female already undressed, I decided I did not feel comfortable trying to organise this at 1am, and that I would try and make do, as there was no other option to fix the noise this was the only other solution. I had a very disturbed sleep and eventually just got up really early as it was too loud to get a deep sleep. 

I was in Dublin for an event so focused on getting ready and to check out, at reception the Front Office Manager took my key card and said ‚Äòthat‚Äôs it, all done‚Äô he did not ask how my stay was or any other familiarities. I was surprised he did not ask me any questions on my stay, or my trip. 

On raising my discomfort over the night, he immediately said, yes we have noted the maintenance request (so clearly was aware of the issue on checking me out and decided not to ask if it had been ok or resolved), the manager was abrupt, non apologetic, and stated as I had not wanted to repack all my bags and get dressed and move to another room at 1am in the morning, that there was nothing else they would offer. As a solo female traveler, I explained I would not have felt comfortable to do that, he said ‚Äòif it really was bad enough, you would have moved‚Äô or called again an hour later. Suggesting I would have instead been comfortable moving rooms at 2am? 

He offered no apology in any way for my impaired experience, and no offer of any kind of good will gesture. Very blunt and quite frankly a very poor attitude towards guest experience. 

I paid over ¬£200 for a big bed I couldn‚Äôt get a decent sleep in.

Very disappointed with the experience at The Address, as a luxury brand, it did not meet my expectations even of a standard chain. I have had better service at Premier Inn‚Äôs, I would not return based on this.",1,2024,03,16
219,An Address to the Address,"Choosing a star level for this hotel was difficult.  We stayed for three nights.  When we first arrived, I had to wait about 20mins for concierge service; there was no one in front of me. The waitress next door was more concerned about my length of waiting than the hotel itself.

Then, the hotel stated there was free parking at the train station, which we learned the hard way was not true when we found a clamp on our tire the next morning, resulting in a ‚Ç¨125 ticket.

Our room was nice at first glance, but upon unpacking and being in the room longer, it was quite dirty (see photos). 

We had requested a general room cleaning, twice, and not once did anyone show up. My husband actually stopped a cleaner in the hallway and asked for clean towels, a tea/coffee replenishment, and for the rubbish to be taken out. They took the rubbish, but then handed me the new trash bags, the new towels, and the tea/coffee. Like literally, just piled them in my hands. 

For a 4-Star hotel, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to change my own rubbish liners ‚Ä¶ 

Breakfast for us was complimentary and nice. The staff was kind and helpful regardless of how busy they were, which was much appreciated.

Overall, it was an okay experience.",3,2024,03,11
219,"Gorgeous hotel, friendly staff and brilliant location","This hotel is stylish and interesting. We also found out it features in James Joyce‚Äôs novel Ulysses which is pretty cool. 
Rooms were very spacious and stylish. 
My one thing is I would have liked a bit more light, but we were hardly in the room. 
We used the gym and spa area, and went up to the rooftop area for the views. 

Staff were friendly and even held our baggage prior to check in whilst we explored. 

Great location, tram stops right outside and walking distance to the city. 

Breakfast was a particular highlight. Hot buffet very fresh and well cooked. Could tell it hadn‚Äôt sat under the lights for hours. 
We‚Äôd love to return!",5,2024,03,11
219,Best hotel to go !,"The hotel was absolutely perfect. The staff is very kind and helpful. The room was marvellous and very comfortable. The breakfast was quite good ans the spa was just perfect. We had a very nice moment there.
We had a nice room with state of art technology for the lights and curtains, and it felt futuristic and great to experience it.",5,2024,03,08
219,Great location with a welcoming staff!,Great location and wonderful staff! The hotel is centrally located with east access to Connelly Station. Our visit was especially pleasant thanks to Kirstie who warmly greeted us at breakfast every morning with a fresh pot of coffee and a smile. Highly recommend!,5,2024,02,29
219,Huge Prices for Not Great Food,"I've had lunch here many times in the past but it's been a while.  Very disappointing menu with no Vegetarian sandwich option just 2 meat options.  There are other vegetarian options on the menu but should be a sandwich for vegetarians/vegans.
Two of us had the potato and leek soup, and both agreed it tasted like water, no flavour whatsoever with an ‚Ç¨8.50 price tag.  Wedges were ok, garlic mayo ok but very expensive lunch for what we got - wouldn't go again tbh.",3,2024,02,28
219,Disastrous Hotel Experience,"The experience at the IB Global Conference in Dublin was meant to be a highlight of my career as a teacher, but it turned into a nightmare due to the incompetence of the hotel where I stayed. Despite preparing meticulously for my presentation, including having my clothes washed and ironed at the hotel, things went awry. Despite assurances, my clothes went missing, along with some of my baby's belongings, totaling ¬£350 in value. The hotel's promises of resolution fell flat as they failed to refund the full amount, with communication lapses lasting over 4 months. Emails were ignored, and promises of payment were not delivered. The disorganization extended beyond lost items; basic requests, like water for my baby, were neglected, leaving me to solve the issue myself late at night. The hotel's mismanagement was evident, with recurring problems like guests complaining at reception about uncleaned laundry. Despite my patience and understanding, the experience highlighted severe flaws in the hotel's operations, tarnishing what should have been a memorable professional opportunity.",1,2024,02,28
219,Lovely Visit and very central location.,It was a central location to Croke Park for the Dublin v Kerry game. Rooms were very comfortable as well.  The lunch was also very nice the bar the next day.   The staff were also very friendly from reception staff to housekeeping staff. Just a very well run place and well done to everyone.,5,2024,02,26
219,Great Dublin Hotel,"Very central location easy to get to. The staff were so friendly on arrival. Our room was beautiful plenty of space and so clean. The beds were so comfortable. We had remote control curtains, lights  very cool. The shower was lovely felt really refreshed. Great location if you are shopping or attending nearby locations for concerts etc. Food was a also lovely would definitely stay there again",5,2024,02,24

219,Lovely hotel with the most friendly staff,Stayed at the address for the first time with my partner in feb 2024 and it was lovely! Very modern affordable hotel right beside the train station and walking distance to O‚ÄôConnell street. The staff were so welcoming and went beyond to make our stay a pleasant one especially Isabel who worked on reception who was so friendly we will deffo be returning!,5,2024,02,18
219,Manager a complete idiot.,Went on a business trip for 2 nights on the second morning I was refused a cooked breakfast even though my company always pay B and B and Sebastian the manager flatly refused to budge really incredibly bad management skills. Won't be going back there ever again. AC in the room probably louder than Concord taking off didn't help either.,1,2024,02,18
219,Lovely Stay,"Stunning room, amazing and helpful staff. Spa was small but really good amenities. Tasty breakfast. Before we even arrived the staff were very helpful, helping us to arrange birthday and valentines treats to be waiting in the room. Flowers were top class.",5,2024,02,17
219,Fist time in Dublin. Lovely people and the highlight for me was the tour of the distilleries. Would love to go back in s,Good hotel excellent staff polite and helpful. Location okayish though it is opposite rail station but within walking distance to the main town area. The food in the bar could‚Äôve been of better choice. Overall good place to stay if you‚Äôre on short vacation. It is clean and the room was lovely.,4,2024,01,30
219,Great experience in Dublin,"Excellent treatment by the staff, especially the attentive and friendly Isabel, who helped us at all times and made our stay in Dublin even more excellent, if possible.
The rooms were very comfortable and clean. Highly recommended if you want to spend a few days in Dublin with a good base of operations, well connected, and a short walk from the city center.",5,2024,01,29
219,Not a good experience,"Not a good  experience. We arrived at the reception and we were welcome by a lovely spanish  lady. The hotel is basically attached to the train station in an  area which wasn't were safe. We were given two rooms in the old part of the hotel. We were very disappointed because the rooms looked really dirty. The  carpet was old, with few stains on it, especially in one corner of the room where, I suppose,  there had been a leak before,  leaving the wall quite mouldy with black marks. The bathroom was very small, no shower but a bath with a shower. Very old doors too. The tap and the sink weren't working properly. On the wall near the fridge there were stains of old coffe which hadn't been cleaned. Furthermore in my friend's room the plug to charge the phone wasn't working.  Luckly the beds were comfortable.  We referred it  to the same spanish lady who politely apologized and told us that she would have tried to sort out the problems. We were also given free drinks but the point was we weren't expecting the rooms to be so old and dirty in a 4 stars hotel.  Breakfast was  good but the coffe machine and the toster  weren't working properly. We would not go back.",2,2024,01,28
219,Absolutely amazing service,"Me and my friends went for what was meant to be one night out in Dublin. Unfortunately due to storm isha our flight was cancelled and we had to stay another night . Earlier that day as we were waiting for our flight we witnessed what seemed like atleast 100+ people seeking shelter in our hotel for the night due to their flight being cancelled before ours . Me and my mates sat there in the reception as we couldn‚Äôt go out due to the weather for a good few hours and  A young gentleman behind the reception blew us away with his amazing customer service. Must of been there for atleast 3+ hours and didn‚Äôt stop to have a drink, toilet break or nothing . Made sure every customer was allocated a room to all their  needs and had the best mannerisms to calm people‚Äôs nerves. Soon we then realised we needed a room back ourselves and he sorted us out straight away . Nothing was too big of a problem and he was more than happy to help .the next day when we were checking out he was there yet again with a big smile happy to help us after such a busy day the day before.  All staff were super friendly and helpful but this one in particular was a star . Definitely a credit to the company .",5,2024,01,24
219,Disappointing,"Could have been a nice trip, however the ‚ÄòSpa‚Äô as advertised wasn‚Äôt open for the most part all weekend. The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night without any kind of explanation given. Some other minor issues, sent in an email to complain about these issues which was acknowledged but never replied to. A shame, as it could have received a good score with some basic customer service & ensuring the facilities advertised are working.",2,2024,01,20
219,Probably wouldn't be back,"Although the hotel is nice enough, I probably wouldn't stay here again. The ""parlor"" etc. that is promised is never open although promoted on the website. Most of the staff are nice but upon getting ready to leave the hotel, we were relaxing in the reception area while waiting to go to the airport and we were asked by a male member of staff to move into the area next door, despite there being no one else in reception, and despite seeing others resting there days prior. This interaction was just completely confusing tbh. After paying for a 4 night stay, I honestly think you should be entitled to sit in the reception area  and relax at your leisure, this is what the chairs/couches are there for. You should really sort out your attitude towards paying guests!",2,2024,01,02
219,"Nice staff, poor cleaning standards.","We stayed here for one night for my birthday and we were pretty disappointed. Upon arrival, works was been under taken outside of the hotel which you could hear, the reception and bar area is very nice, reception staff and bar staff very friendly, unfortunately cleaners don‚Äôt understand much English. We firstly entered the lift and it smelt really bad, we went to our room and the room was the same, very smelly and dirty. We went to reception and was moved to the address club. The lift was smelly again and the room was still dirty. Standard of cleaning is very poor and rooms need a deep clean. Mould in baths, hairs on bedding along with stains. Dirty windows and rubbish on ledges. A nice hotel ruined by cleanliness. In some rooms you can hear the noise of the trams which is annoying on a morning and night, during the day not so bad as you are out. You can hear the people next door and in corridors. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt be back and I think for the price we paid you can get better hotels - in this case I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.",3,2023,12,27
219,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!,"There are so many things that I could say about our experience here, and I will‚Ä¶ 

To start, we enjoyed the location of the property the most. The hotel is located RIGHT by the train station and bus routes, you can get anywhere you need/want to go.

Bonus, the hotel restaurant stays open until 11, serving food until about 950. This was great because everywhere else in the area stopped serving food between 6-7 o‚Äôclock. More on this later‚Ä¶ 

Use of the spa was definitely worth the upgrade to the CLUB room, it was clean and tidy every morning we went‚Ä¶ best to go in the morning because no one is there and it‚Äôs an incredible start to the day. 

The breakfast ahhh, the breakfast‚Ä¶ just do it. Trust us. It was SO worth it. There were so many options and it was DELICIOUS. 

And let‚Äôs talk about the staff‚Ä¶ wonderful. Actually correction certain staff were great, others we weren‚Äôt super fond of (if you stay in the club rooms get ready for slamming doors starting at 7 AM; to be fair that‚Äôs a mix of cleaning crew and guests). 

That being said, Thierno and Sean in the restaurant, Isabell from the front desk, and all of the breakfast staff every morning (we couldn‚Äôt remember the name tags or we would‚Äôve named them all)‚Ä¶ we cannot thank you enough for the amazing service we were provided during our stay. Thierno and Sean were extremely attentive to our needs, serving us the best drinks and food. They were super personable and they engaged us in conversation. And Isabell upon check in, even when she was busy, was extremely attentive and got us checked in in a very timely manor (she also said hi to us every morning when we were off for the day).

Honestly, if I could give it more than 5 stars I would. I would recommend this stay to anyone who plans to visit Dublin.",5,2023,12,23
219,Highly recommend ,"We stayed at the hotel for the Sale Sharks rugby game. There were 26 in our party, 4 family rooms. 
The hotel is well located, within walking distance of the centre, outside the tram stop and 20mins taxi from the airport. 
The rooms were very nice and clean, with 3 of the families being upgraded.
We opted to purchase the breakfast at ‚Ç¨15pp, definitely worth it as there's plenty of choice.
Thank you to Isabel for finding my sons cap he'd just purchased, your saw the smile as you gave it him! 
We would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again when visiting Dublin.",4,2023,12,18
219,Comfortable friendly hotel in Dublin. Thank you Isabel for the saving our holiday,"Great modern rooms, very friendly and helpful staff. Newly refurbished high-tech rooms with great beds and comfortable clean rooms. Friendly and comfortable atmosphere, breakfast was good, although it can get a bit crowded during the morning rush. The hotel is well located. Only negative thing to say is the proximity to the tram rail line that can be heard into the hotel rooms, but that is a minor inconvenience as it is not loud, and perhaps not a problem for people used to the hustle and bustle of a modern city. ",5,2023,12,11
219,"Great location , great staff","Great location, great staff. Stayed recently for 2 midweek nights. Very close to both north and south of the city. Walked down to meetings in IFSC.  Would stay again no bother. 

Stayed in one night and enjoyed the food. 

Dublin main train station across the road. I had a meeting in Belfast so got train up and down in day.",5,2023,12,08
219,3 night break in Dublin City,"1st time in Dublin, stayed at The Address for 3 nights.  The reception area and restaurant were impressive on arrival.  Checked in without problem.  We were allocated room 667 on the 6th floor.  Lovely spacious room - big bed, nice bathroom.  Downside was the noise from the adjacent Connolly Station.  Trains start leaving the station at 5:30am and are quite frequent.  This led to disturbed sleep.  Pointed out to reception on departure, and the receptionist was flabbergasted that we could hear the trains from our room - hear them, we could see them!!
We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night - the food was uninspiring.
We had breakfast on the first morning - good quality breakfast, you can return to the self service as many times as you need to.   Very pleasant staff in the breakfast room.
Overall, clean and comfortable, although not in the centre of Dublin and it's quite a walk to Temple Bar etc.
30 euro in a taxi from the airport.",4,2023,12,06
219,The best service with great staff Isabel,"Amazing stay at The address connolly hotel.we went for an event for 5 days Herbalife .

219,Excellent,Stayed here with tour group.  Breakfast was wonderful with great coffee.  Room was very nice with a comfortable bed.  Would stay here again.  Beautiful hotel.  Great staff.  Weather was pleasant with just a touch of rain.,5,2023,11,20
219,Great Stay,A stylish hotel to stay in Dublin. A fine breakfast to start the day followed by drinks and local advice by the knowledgeable bar manager of many years set us up well for a fine day around Dublin. All staff were really helpful which created a good atmosphere within the hotel.,5,2023,11,20
219,All about the customer service.,"Hotel is in a great location on the edge of town. Very clean and sparkling. Lots of character in the communal areas.

Rooms are being modernised currently but the maintenance team joins in with the guests when you pass them. This is because the team are brilliant. Great customer service by everyone with Isabel leading the way and she greets every person as they pass the desk.

The bar and restaurant managers were visible and chatty to all guests and very welcoming. ",4,2023,11,17
219,"Great stay, lovely hotel with fabulous customer service. ","I visit Dublin on business regularly and tried the Address Connolly due to its proximity to local transport hubs and the Quay. A very warm welcome from staff, with a relaxed atmosphere on entering. 
Rooms are very comfortable, love the availability of bathrobe and the little chocolates were a nice added extra.
Extremely comfortable beds, great quality pillows. All in all I had a very comfortable stay after a long day of meetings.
When checking out, reception asked if I wanted to leave my case while I went to work, this wasn‚Äôt something I even thought about, it was so helpful! ",5,2023,11,14
219,Modern hotel with great staff!,"Love their room tech! Gorgeous modern hotel with a perfectly sumptuous bed to land on after a long day of touring around Dublin. Excellent closet space, had great in room amenities and accommodating, helpful front desk staff.
The only downfall, hotel is located in a slightly sketchy part of Dublin after dark.  Would not recommend a solo female traveler stay here and walk back under the train line after dark, daytime hours I felt perfectly fine. Would definitely stay here again next time in Dublin.",5,2023,11,10
219,Absolute Gem,"Just stayed for one night with a friend. We were in Dublin for a concert. We had the best stay, everything at this hotel is top class. The staff are attentive, friendly and genuinely want you to have a good stay. 

Our club room had everything we needed. The bed, especially the cushions, were super comfy! 

The hotel has been recently refurbished and has a luxurious feel to it with all the mod cons. 

Breakfast was lovely, served in their cellar dinning room. Had the usual Irish breakfast options plus continental items. 

Unfortunately the Spa area was occupied with maintenance guys so we couldn't use it but it looked very nice. 

Overall, we had a great stay, we will return & recommend it to all of our family & friends.",5,2023,11,09
219,Thank you Isabel for making our trip so memorable,"This hotel is really nice and the staff and very helpful. I want to say a big thank you to Isabel for making our stay so memorable and the feeling of being valued. Thank you again Isabel. 

The hotel is clean and fresh, the beds are comfy and we slept really well. The AC works great too. 

When we are back in Dublin, we‚Äôll definitely be back here!",5,2023,11,06
219,Nightmare from check in to check out and beyond,"Upon arrival at the address, connoly there was a bit of a queue for the check in desk, we waited in line patiently (about 10minutes or so) and quickly got a room on the 9th floor. We were told we had been upgraded to a 'club' room, however the room was definitely not a club room from appearance. The button to open/close the curtains was broken and we manually opened/closed them. The room was freezing and the heater wasn't working so we addressed this at the reception on our way to dinner at the on site restaurant, to which the response was it won't be able to be fixed but they were able to put a portable heater in our room which did the job. At the steakhouse in the hotel we ordered drinks first which arrived around 50 minutes later as we were just finishing up our main course ( we had asked once for them during the starter and twice during the main meal before they were bought out). The breakfast service was good and we enjoyed the spa with no issues. We had a late check out of 1pm as part of our 'taste' package and check out was swift with no issues.... that is until around 4pm when I got an extremely rude phonecall from a man working the reception of the hotel who accused us of breaking a desk in the room despite calling me shelly ( not my name) and having the wrong room number, after a brief argument from myself that he had the wrong person, and saying he would go to check he called me back to accuse me of being friends with the person in the other room since we were both from belfast (apparently) and since my number was somehow linked to her room and I was therefore responsible. Absolute nightmare from start to finish! Would avoid wasting any money on this hotel as staff clearly don't know what they're doing, and can't even make a simple apology upon finding they're wrong.",1,2023,11,05
219,Highly recommend ,"Hotel is beautifully decorated,  high standard of cleanliness throughout.  The staff where amazing so kind and helpful. The breakfast was delicious.  We had a great stay and look forward to a return visit again sometime.  ",5,2023,11,03
219,Great place to stay,"This was a nice hotel in a good location. It was very clean although one of the plug sockets didn‚Äôt work but we survived. It was really clean and the staff were lovely and really helpful. Breakfast is brilliant and you can really fill up each morning. The tour buses and shopping are close by and the train station is opposite. We ate in the restaurant downstairs a couple of times as the food is,reasonable priced and the staff were great. If we ever go to Dublin again we would stay here again. However, Dublin is very expensive all round so we will probably go abroad instead as it‚Äôs cheaper‚Ä¶sorry Dublin",4,2023,10,31
219,Solid enough city centre option.,"Pros
Good food
Friendly staff 
Location beside train station 
Chocolates in room nice touch

Cons
Talbot street is rough at night at dark
Walls are paper thin
Pillows ridiculously soft
Room advertised a bath tub and no bath
Air con noisey( although most are)

219,Fab breakfast,"I had an amazing visit to ""The Address"" hotel! The staff were incredibly welcoming and made me feel right at home. Kirstie's service during breakfast was an absolute delight. The breakfast itself was brilliant, with high-quality sausages and delightful Danish pastries. The evening meal was also very tasty, making my stay even more enjoyable. I highly recommend this fabulous hotel for a fantastic experience!",5,2023,10,27
219,"Unhelpful Staff, Dirty and Unkept Rooms","This hotel was booked as part of a travel package I purchased. We had 2 rooms for 4 travelers in our party. We were booked on separate ends of the hotel separated by 4 floors. When we requested to be moved closer we were told, ""not possible."" When we pressed that we were all traveling together, we were told again it was not possible. My 83 year old mother and I were put in a room on the first floor that had no elevator access. 

In looking at the restaurant, bar, lobby, or at breakfast it didn't seem that the hotel was completely full.

Staff was rude and unapologetic. I had been given 2 keys to my room which after I walked there neither worked. There was no apology and I was treated as though I had done something wrong.

One room was 85 degrees. When we complained we were told there is no air and to just turn the unit off. Even turning the unit off only ""cooled"" the room to 80. The other room had no heat. At the time Dublin weather was in the low 40s in the evening so our room was very cold. We were told there was nothing they could do but they could offer a space heater. We declined that, in such a small area it didn't seem very safe.

Bothrooms were dirty and unkept. The shower handle fell off, the bathtub drain didn't work, there was mold, it just looked and felt like things were not cleaned well.

There is no on-site parking so you have to park in an unsecure lot (for 10 euros) about a quarter of a mile away and lug your luggage over cobblestone ways. There was scaffolding and fencing all around the property which made it very difficult to locate.

All-in-all, I would avoid this location regardless of cost.",1,2023,10,25
219,Top hotel in dublin,"Warm welcome from Isabel the most kind hostess we ever met!
with 4 guys we get an upgrade to the oscar wilde suit! 

Very nice room with enough space and a balcony, only the bathroom was a little bit old.
Our special requist for cold champagne when we arrive‚úÖ

We didnt prebooked breakfast and this was no problem to fix when we arrived

 Amazing friendly staff who made our stay really enjoyable! From reception to barstaff all well done!

Small but nice spa! Sauna infrared and big bubblebath included",5,2023,10,24

219,Nice hotel with very friendly staff. ,"Nice hotel with very friendly staff. Especially Kirstie who works at breakfast. Tice hotel with very friendly staff.he food is fine and the bar cosy.

219,"Great hotel, friendly staff, good food.","Stayed overnight after missing our connections and had a lovely room, excellent dinner and a few drinks in the bar.   Breakfast was great with lots of choice and numerous selections.  Whatever you enjoy is there.   Only had the one night but will certainly come again for a long weekend in the Spring and stay here.   Great value for money  too and warm and friendly staff.  Very welcoming.  Recommended.",5,2023,10,17
219,"Hotel is close to Train station, buses, and taxis. The Hotel itself is the place to stay!",We were very satisfied with our stay  at this hotel. It was our first time visiting Dublin. The staff was wonderful especially Kirstie who worked in the cafe and the Dining room for breakfast. Always cheerful and willing to answer all our questions and gave us info about our excursions. The rooms are very well kept and clean. The beds are very comfortable although they don't have a top sheet on the beds. Just the comforter that has a removable cover.  With that said we would go back if ever in Dublin.,5,2023,10,11
219,Avoid this hotel,"I would highly recommend to avoid this hotel. First of all, the location is not great, the night I arrived there was an assault next to the hotel so that was not a great start. The only benefit of location is that it is near the city but there are better places in the city.  Second, the room had a broken floor for which I forgot to make a video. The tiles in the bathroom were either broken or were wobbly. Third, I was not able to sleep the first night. In the morning when I checked my pillow was full of fungus. I took a picture of it as attached. Fourth, while I was in the room resting, the room service came in after knocking at the door when I didn't reply and did not want anyone in. Fifth, the room was prepaid by my company as this was a business trip. However, when I arrived they told me that it was not paid. As this was a weekend, I had no choice but to pay. After the weekend, their finance team finally confirmed that it was prepaid and I will receive a refund. But now they paid me in Euros instead of Pounds as that was the currency I chose to pay. Due to conversion rates now I lost ¬£31 because of their incompetency. They promised that they will pay me the difference however, I am still waiting for these after over a month. I would recommend to avoid them.",1,2023,10,10
219,Poor rooms ,My room was a walk up only and right below where they were doing renovation also all I heard and felt were the trains going by I feel I was given this room right above the restaurant as I was by myself ,2,2023,10,07
219,One night visit in Dublin in a beautiful hotel,"Me and my boyfriend chose this hotel for the great location to the 3 arena and the price. We were celebrating our anniversary so I had mentioned that when booking and not only were we upgraded to a beautiful room but we also got a nice view and a lovely dessert plate. The beds were so comfortable and the view from the club lounge was nice. We also used the pool the day after and it was heated and very relaxed atmosphere.
Being a hotelier myself, I appreciate and thank every staff member that assisted us. Would definitely visit again.",5,2023,10,04
219,Good hotel for a short break,"A good four star hotel which is slightly off the beaten track, about 15-20 minutes walk to Grafton Street/Temple Bar.

The food was good but there wasn't a separate bar, just a bar/restaurant which was a bit disappointing.

Overall a good hotel for a short break in Dublin. ",4,2023,10,02
219,Good Location,"Modern Hotel, very close to city Centre, but far away that it is quiet. rooms are very modern, spacious and comfortable, good value for money. very close to the business district and with a train station across the way a plentyfull supply of taxis, buses and rail/light rail.",5,2023,09,29
219,Best hotel ever! ,"We stayed at the Address Connolly 2 weeks ago to celebrate a friends birthday. It was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in!

219,Nice hotel in a good location,"Really enjoyed our stay here for a recent concert. The hotel is nicely decorated and the room itself was very nice. There's a few small points that let it down, for example there was a socket in the room that was loose from the wall. We ate in McGettigan's and the food was just ok, even with a full hotel for a concert it wasn't too busy but the service was very slow. The staff were friendly and nice so it's not that the service was bad, just slow. Prices were ok for the menu on offer but if we stay here again we would probably head somewhere else to eat as there is a lot of nice places in walking distance.",4,2023,09,25
219,Great location and pleasant lodging.,"Recently renovated, across the street from train station.  We paid to include breakfast in our reservation ‚Äî well worth it.  Great staff all around.
Our room & bed we‚Äôre comfortable & sparkling clean.  The staff were helpful with questions we had about the area.",5,2023,09,24
219,Mixed Fortunes,"Booked in and assigned room number 110. Three single beds, crammed into which, was obviously a room only suitable for a double. 
The shower was dangerous as the water temperature couldn't be controlled and was scalding hot.  
Water was running down one of the inside walls - it had been raining but it was obvious that this had been happening for some time as the water ingress had marked the ceiling. 
These issues were so obvious that 110 should have been withdrawn from use until made safe and repaired. 
We requested another room after staying in 110 for one night. 
We were assigned room 456 - definitely up to standard but the key card we were given didn't allow the lighting to work properly. We were plunged into darkness several times, no lights at all in the bathroom. We phoned reception and they supplied us with a new key card. 
Now all was well, as it should have been from when we checked in. 
Room 456 was a nice room and we were happy there for our second and last night. 
On the plus side we did enjoy our stay and would stay there again when in Dublin. 
The breakfast was really good, the reception staff were polite and helpful but are obviously being let down badly by the higher management.
We have since laughed about our experience. If you're offered 110 avoid it at all costs - should be a lol there.     ",4,2023,09,17

219,Nice find in Dublin.,"Location was great - close to Connolly station. Nicely renovated recently. Great service and nice room and amenities.

Cool art on the walls as well.",5,2023,09,04
219,Fantastic stay in a stylish hotel close to the city centre,"We loved our long weekend in The Address Connolly. The food was fantastic (we ate 'Dublin smokies' and other fabulous seafood in McGettigan's Cookhouse), the room was comfortable and staff were friendly and very helpful.",5,2023,09,04
219,Quality but too many let downs,"Overall quality of finish is good but let down by a few simple things. We booked twin rooms for our business group and we‚Äôre given doubles. 

The mattress was awful and dipped at the edges causing you to roll off. No food or drinks in the mini bar. 

TV content was poor with most channels being unavailable. ",3,2023,08,31
219,Excellent,"Such a lovely place to stay, and we felt most welcomed, in particular by Joao and Jamile on reception. The room was quiet and of a very high clean standard, gorgeous bathroom, king size bed, comfy pillows and mattress. The breakfast was excellent, with a wide variety of options to suit everyone's tastes. A taxi was arranged for our depature the next day, by the reception team, 
which was very efficient.  I would highly recommend staying at The Address Connolly, because it has a very welcoming and friendly approach to their guests, and the staff are 5 star.  Thank you for making our stay very pleasurable.",5,2023,08,31
219,Big ups to Sebastian!,"I went with my teenager for a 2 night break in Dublin in the middle of August.
The room was impeccable, the air conditioning thing was a bit loud but we got to grips with it quite easily.  All the staff were friendly but some could have been a bit friendlier I would say.  Sebastian however was a major star, we had a couple of minor issues that he totally took over and sorted in no time, efficiently and with a smile.

I may never come back as I tend to stay somewhere different every time I visit a city but I may well come back here as the sauna and little pool were lovely.  Regardless, I would have no hesitation in recommending it.",4,2023,08,29
219,Great hotel in convenient location,"Great accommodations in a convenient location - easy to get around Dublin. Train and LUAS steps away.

219,Great customer service,"The hotel is very nice, our room was quite fancy compared to where we normally stay. Staff at the front desk were very helpful.

219,"Nice hotel, surrounding area felt a little unsafe for female solo traveler","Very nice hotel right across the road from Connolly station and The Luas just around the corner. 
Not a great area at night time. The hotel has a very cosy bar area, the reception staff were lovely but the little gem was the Security man on the door. Lovely Dublin gentleman, an asset to your establishment.
I had a trim room as a solo traveler, would have loved a double bed but that wasn't available as I had booked single occupancy!!
Breakfast was wonderful.",4,2023,08,23

The decor, the rooms and ALL the staff made my stay so enjoyable.  Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get the receptionists name, she was so lovely and give us 2 beautiful rooms.  I stayed in room 440 and it was beautifully decorated, and spotless.  The bed and pillows was so comfortable I didn‚Äôt want to get up.  Breakfast the next morning had everything and more that you could ever want.  So impressed with the selection, the taste and the flavour.  A special mention for Felipe who was so pleasant, friendly and helpful.  I lost my phone and he did everything he could and found it.  If in Dublin book here you won‚Äôt regret it.  I want to go back to room 440 ",5,2023,08,22
219,Outstanding customer service ,"We had an unexpected stay at The Address Connolly due to a flight cancellation. I cannot praise the welcome we got from the staff at the hotel highly enough. It is no easy task welcoming a whole flight load of customers at short notice. We arrived exhausted and stressed after our 2nd flight cancellation in 48 hours. The staff welcomed us with smiles and sat us straight down for a hot meal as soon as we arrived. We then checked in to our room which was modern and immaculately clean. The beds were very comfortable which was much needed. We literally ate, slept and left for our rescheduled flight early the next morning but couldn't have asked for more in our hour of need. We will definitely consider staying here if we return to Dublin some day. Thank you for looking after us so well in such stressful circumstances. ",5,2023,08,20

219,All Good!! ,"Our visit included two separate stays with a trip to Galway in between.  Location was especially convenient to the train and the tram.  Rooms were clean, neat and very comfortable.   McGettigan‚Äôs Cookhouse was fabulous! Front desk staff were wonderful. Porters stored our bags while we waited to check in. We especially want to note Isabel at the front desk. She took such good care of us and made sure we had everything we needed. She made sure to welcome us back when we returned for our second stay. ",5,2023,08,13
219,Scarce quality,"old fashioned room with dirty forniture.  No hair dryer, old phone not working, elecric system not working properly.  Annoying check in policy: 2 days beforearrival we received an mail apparently asking for our arrival time  and , after our reply (1pm) they sent a message proposing an early check in at 46 euro, room availablr at 3pm. We arrived at 1.30pm and we were told to wait.  At 2.45pm the room was ready (presumably) and we received the keys. Surprise! in our room the ceiling was leaking water and a tecnician was working inside! What did we wait for? 
A suggestion: you can charge a little more on the room and avoid this annoying try to sell a useless and irritating early check in",2,2023,08,12
219,Worst customer service experience,"While the hotel is beautifully decorated the service was the worst I have ever encountered in a hotel. Checked in and had booked a pre-theatre, dinner, bed and breakfast deal but the receptionist thought it was room only, thought that was it sorted but continued to cause problems when we went to eat with me having to prove ball showing my booking confirmation before we were admitted to breakfast. The room wasn't ready when we arrived for check in and were kept waiting for half an hour (after 3pm). The ""exclusive"" lounge, while beautifully decorated was let down by tables covered in cigarette butt's on the terrace. Bad signage around the hotel made it difficult to find our room (no butler as promised in the earlier email. One of MANY!) Lots of emails and high tech equipment in the room but lacking in customer service.

219,"Welcoming, super comfortable & friendly place to stay. Classy,  chic & close to the city perks.","Welcoming & I liked the ambience of the lighting of reception. 

The staff & room instantly meeted my expectations . I was given a king size bed which was the comfiest bed and pillows you could ever ask for. 

I was staying for one night for relaxation & a city break",5,2023,08,08
219,A comfortable home away from home,"We stayed here 5 nights for the Soroptimist International Convention.  Our room was very comfortable with everything we needed.  Quiet at night so no disturbance of sleep. The included breakfast buffet was excellent. All of the staff, from the front desk, concierge, breakfast room and housekeeping, were so friendly and helpful it truly was our home away from home.  The attached restaurant, McGettigans Cookhouse, had excellent food at a decent price and all the staff there went above and beyond to make you feel welcome. The location was about a 7 minute walk to the EPIC Irish Emigration Museum and then another 7 minutes along the river to the convention center. It's across the street from Connolly train station. There is a taxi stand and the bus and trolley on the same street. We would absolutely stay here again when visiting Dublin and would try another Address hotel if staying in one of the cities where they have hotels. ",5,2023,08,07
219,Awesome place!,"Isabel at the front desk was very knowledgeable. She was amazing and helped us navigate the city with providing us information for the local team system they use. 
Kirstie in the ‚ÄúCellar‚Äù where they served breakfast everyday was extremely helpful and attentive. She helped us with our seats, got us juice, tea and coffee.  She also gave us some good information on some
Local spots to go and listen to the Irish music. Overall our stay was amazing!",5,2023,08,05
219,Great stay,"We were travelling as a family of 4, arrived early at the hotel and were amazed to find the rooms ready.
Super clean and bright- amazing bath and bed linens.
The bar was gorgeous, busy with a nice vibe and quick service.
Breakfast excellent. Also staff well groomed and very friendly.",5,2023,08,04
219,Brilliant hotel,"Staff was super friendly, they upgraded us because we were 3 adults in one room. everything was clean, breakfast was superb, lots of choice all fresh. Our son loved the pancakes. the spa was very enjoyable. Perfekt stay! ",5,2023,08,04
219,Very nice and kind staff experience,"During our visit to Dublin, Ireland, me and my husband chose to be accomodated at The Address Connoly hotel.

This hotel has all the necessary amenities and services for a good and confortable stay. 

But we want this review to be more about the hotel‚Äôs people and less about the rest, as people are the ones that make any business work and be successful.

The hotel staff is generally nice and willing to help.

From this staff one person got remarked by us in particular: Felipe, who can be found in the club lounge area and also at the reception desk. 

The way he treated us made us feel very special. 

He is very professional, has a very elegant behaviour and is very nice, kind and warm as a person too.  

He is always trying to help and satisfy you and he makes you feel very well, as he always has a smile and a good word to offer.

Also, the communication with him was very easy and pleasant, as he is a very good English speaker (even if English is not his native language) and, besides that, he also speaks fluently Portuguese and Spanish.

Besides, he also offered us valuable advice about what we can visit and do in Dublin.

So, it is good to notice that this hotel is careful in chosing its people and values its human resources.",5,2023,08,03
219,Disappointing Stay in Dublin,"We booked a one-night stay at the Address Connolly based on a recommendation in the Rick Steves Ireland guidebook and the hotel's website. Overall, we were a bit disappointed with our stay, and the hotel's management reached out to us after we let the front desk staff know about our disappointments. Ultimately, they refunded 40 EUR of our 262 EUR room rate.
We checked in with ease at the front desk and were told that we'd been upgraded to a Club Room. We were told that the room was larger than the one we'd booked, and that it had some great in-room features. We weren't told about the Club Lounge, though, so we didn't get to take advantage of that amenity.
Based on the photos on the website, we were expecting a room with views of the city and the River Liffey. Room 343 looked out on to the railway tracks and a graffitied wall. As we were only staying one night, we unpacked a bit reluctantly, figuring that trying to get a different room would take too much time and that we'd miss our tour booking at the Guinness Storehouse.
The room itself was spacious and had some cool gadgetry--the lights and curtains are controlled by touch screens in different locations throughout the room. The bed was comfortable, and the air conditioning worked well. There seemed to be some pet hair on the throw at the foot of the bed, and the tea caddy was rather dusty. The bath had lovely plush towels, but the soap dispenser at the sink was broken. There was no WiFi during our stay, and there was a different customer's name on the welcome page of the TV. 
We were also surprised that the room did not have an interior security chain. We were on a club floor that could only be accessed with a key card, but not having a security chain seemed rather odd.
Because we had to leave before breakfast was served, we were given a takeaway bag with a sandwich, an orange, and a bottle of water. The sandwich was pretty bad--dried out ham and cheese on white bread.
There were some nice elements to our stay, to be sure, but overall we did not feel that our stay at the Address Connolly was great value for the money.",3,2023,08,02
219,Amazing Experience,"I've been travelling around Ireland, I have to stay that this property is a state of art. When coming in, reception is such a lovely environment. Restaurant is great, I also had the opportunity of talking to one of he managers, he was actually the one insisting I would leave a review and I would like to praise him for his services. Not sure what was his name but he was working this morning. ",5,2023,08,01
219,Don't.let the bad reviews put you off.,"After reading some reviews we nearly cancelled. I'm so glad we didn't everything was brilliant from start to finish, room, bar area, reception staff and breakfast.
One of our party has already rebooked.",5,2023,07,26
219,Excellent customer service,"My husband and I stayed at the Address Connolly several times during our trip to Ireland in May 2023, as we used Dublin as our hub. We had very nice rooms each time, and we enjoyed the rooftop breakfasts in the club area.
We would particularly like to commend Isabelle at reception who looked after us so well and welcomed us so warmly on our return visits.",4,2023,07,25
219,A pleasant surprise!,"Needed to stay somewhere close to the Connelly Train station for a trip to Belfast. Was recommended The Address and glad we stayed there for the night. Train station was across the road! Staff were helpful, room was spotless and close to restaurants and supermarkets! Ideal for what we needed!",5,2023,07,20
219,Great experience in a fun and comfortable hotel!,"My group of 11 ranging in ages from 6 to 76 stayed for two nights at The Address Connolly this month. We all very much enjoyed our stay. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. They provided us with rooms all on the same floor to make it easier for us and we hadn't even asked for that. 
Isabel was particularly attentive and was so sweet to my young son. The rooms were clean and comfortable and I wasn't expecting extras like robes and keurig type coffee makers for the price. 
We also enjoyed having amenities like the restaurant and beer garden on site.
We felt like we got a great deal and we would definitely return.",5,2023,07,17
219,Avoid - Worst Experience and aftercare. AVOID AVOID AVOID,"I stayed at this hotel for work for 2 days, initial check in experience was great, the guy behind the desk was accommodating and helpful. Not having water in a club room is not a great as you would expect it, but he did send some up for me.This is where the good service and experience ended. 

I returned from work on day 2 and the air con in my room was making a horrendous noise, rattling and banging. When I was due to go out I spoke to reception and told them (at 5.30pm) that the aircon was making an awful noise and I wanted someone to go and look at it. I gave the receptionist , who had very little interest in this conversation the room number 3 times, she kept writing it down wrong as she was more concerned with listening to others conversations than dealing with the conversation in hand. Eventually she  got the number right and wrote this down (or so I thought....) . I was going out for dinner so asked for someone to go and look at this so that when I returned it would be resolved. 

When I returned at 10-10.30 pm I walked into the room and slipped on the floor, landing on my back and knocking my elbow. The aircon had leaked (A LOT) all over the floor, and as the floor directly inside the door is marble it was like an ice rink. Water was still leaking from the ceiling at this time too. 

I immediately went downstair and spoke to the Duty Manager (again very disinterested) and told him that I had water leaking from the ceiling and it needed to be looked at. I also made him aware that I had made a complaint 5 hours previously and had subsequently slipped on the floor. 

The DM came up to the room and saw the issue and started using the towels from the bathroom to mop up the floor. He then said he needed to go and look and see what could be done and he would be 'back in 5 minutes' . 20 minutes goes by and after another call to reception (at this time it was 11.15pm) he returned and said I could not stay in the room, and he had to move me. I had to re pack the bag and then move 8 floor down, across the lobby and then up 3 flights of stairs to a dingy room, which smelt of smoke and had rubbish on the floor, it was not the room grade I booked either. I appreciate the hotel is busy but the room was DISGUSTING.

 I immediately walked out and asked them to book me a cab and stated I would go and check in at the Conrad. Out of no where he found another room, one floor down from my original room , with the same grade. I moved into this room. By now it is nearly midnight and I have been walking round the hotel with a lot of bags and a sore back and elbow. He was rude on a number of occasions and really not. helpful. he did offer me an ambulance, however this is not something I wanted to do as I was not in need or A+E and did not want to waste the time of the overstretched health services. 

I asked for the incident report to be logged, he said he would do this but I was not allowed a copy of this. I corrected him and said the incident report is about me and I am entitled by law to receive a copy. We went back and fourth about 3/4 time on this. Eventually he assured me he would send me an email be fore he left and took my email address. Safe to say, this email did not come, nor was a hand over given to the new DM on shift the following morning. 

I went down the following day to make another complaint and retrieve the incident report. Apparently this was locked in the HR office and could not be reviewed until the hotel manager , Michael Lynch arrived at 12pm. Again I reiterated the complaint I had made the day before, the fact that no one went to look at the aircon (apparently they took the room number down wrong and went to the wrong room) and then I had an accident. Their lack of care and attention has led to this nothing else. If the original receptionist had actioned what I asked, this would have been avoided. 

As Michael was not due to 12 I asked for the email to be sent a call from Michael before my flight at 3pm, guess what ... it did not happen. I landed and got home and made 3 phone calls to speak to Michael and got the following - 

1. Michael was not in 
2. Michael was in a meeting 
3. Michael was not in (and had not been in)

The issue with this is , that the receptionist slipped up as she said I will just speak to him , and then went off to have the conversation. Eventually after phone call 4 and a number of interactions with staff who clearly did not want to discuss the matter with me , he rang me back. At this stage the incident report was still not with me. I was told numerous times I had been sent an email and based on the fact I gave my email address (which I wrote down) to 4 different people - surely they could not get this wrong.... they did... 

I went back through everything that happened , he did apologise, but did not a lot else and then sent me a word doc of an incident report with a) the wrong name on b) missing information . We then had to go back and fourth over 7 days to get this updated. He did check in and ask how my elbow is , but only after I chase for data or emails, there is nothing proactive around his approach. 

He has offered me a free night in a club suite with dinner and lunch for 2, but frankly I do not want to step foot in this hotel ever again , I have told him this three times now, yet he keeps offering this as 'compensation' of my issues. This has been the worst experience I have had at a hotel in years 

In summary , avoid this hotel , they have no customer care and their negligence has led to me hurting myself which could have been avoided. Also if you do stay , avoid the breakfast, I asked for porridge as everything else looked AWFUL and I waited 20 minutes and it still did not come out. So I left .",1,2023,07,12
219,Family in Dublin,"We had wonderful service and clean rooms.
The hotel was close to everything.  Our last night we had a large family gathering and staff was absolutely wonderful and put us in our own large room. I definitely would recommend this hotel!",5,2023,07,11
219,Ruined 50th birthday trip,"The Address Connolly ruined my 50th birthday. A club suite was booked in March 23 direct with the hotel. We arrived on my birthday. Tired after a flight and bus ride we checked in, paid in full and set off for our suite to find there was no suite. The receptionist (one of several who constantly never smiled) happily took full payment and knew she was sending us to a room not a suite but seemingly that is ok with her. Perhaps she thought we wouldn‚Äôt notice? The manager blamed a booking engine. There was no booking engine. I think it is common practice to upgrade guests (at their expense or not) at this hotel and our suite had been merrily given to someone else. We were moved to the suite the next day. The day after my birthday. Yes we did accept a free dinner, what else were we supposed to do? No I did not happily accept this. Tried to end our evening with a coffee in the club lounge upon which the coffee machine practically exploded all over me. Had an instant coffee instead. Went to the spa at the end of our stay, the sauna and the steam room were not functioning and the spa pool was colder than I would have a bath. Rang reception and was promised someone would come to action, no one came, sat there uncomfortably with several male guests in the cold then gave up. Overall I think this has potential to be a great hotel as the decor is fantastic but the staff let it down so much I would never recommend it - 100% style over substance.",2,2023,07,11
219,You have been warned,"Shame I could not give this place zero stars. Truly the worst experience at a hotel ever. Catalogue of errors and poor service.

After check in they also checked someone else into the same room as me. These people took their luggage up to the room and left it there despite seeing my clothes and shoes and laptop on the bed. Only up side was they said they like my clothes and shoes! 

There was also a nasty pair of dirty socks left in the room from, I presume, the previous occupants. How did they get missed? No apologies about anything from the staff.

The reception said the manager would come and talk to me about the problems I had there that very same day. . . . . . Dear reader, sadly I am still waiting.

When I checked out they said the manager would email me instead. They took my email address twice just to ensure there would be no further issues. Guess what? Still waiting.

I decided to go onto their website and let them know about a couple of the issues (there were more) and a manager was going to get back in touch with me. . . . . No prizes for guessing what happened next . . . . . Yep still waiting.

I would go on but it is pointless, no action taken, no customer service and most importantly of all there will be no me going there again. I suggest you do the same unless of course you don‚Äôt mind sharing your room with other guests and having dirty, flea bitten, smelly items of clothing in your room to keep you company. Steer clear of this place for your own sanity. Next time it might be someone‚Äôs dirty underpants. You have been warned. . . . ",1,2023,07,07
219,Excellent 2-night Stay,"My family of 4 spent the last 2 nights of our 2 week trip to Ireland here. We were a little concerned after reading some of the recent reviews, but we had a wonderful stay. We had booked a family room (2 double beds), and were pleasantly surprised to find we had been put in a suite with a king bed and 2 twin beds, which was much more comfortable for us. The room was very clean, and the beds were comfortable. The air conditioning and wifi worked great. We couldn‚Äôt hear the trains at all from our room, despite the hotel‚Äôs proximity to Connolly Station. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly. We would definitely stay here again if/when we return to Dublin.",5,2023,07,07
219,Disappointed  trip,"The staff not  friendly  or welcoming  it all seems  to be a money grabbing game.
Toilet not flushing ..WiFi  not working. 
Sink not cleaned..and bits chocolate  on the chairs..wouldn't  recommend the hotel to anyone..",2,2023,07,03
219,Uncomfortable experience ,"Disappointed with my one night stay.
Got into our Premier King Room at 9pm.
Very strong smell of cigarette smoke.
Two single beds pushed together, but mattresses were comfortable.
Even thou the outside temperature was around 15c our temperature gauge never dropped below 27c. The food in the bar was beautiful & staff were friendly, couldn‚Äôt be faulted.Very little sleep got because of the heat in the room all night. In the morning we found ourselves with no water in our bathroom, no shower, no flush.Rang reception a couple of times no answer, eventually when they did answer they apologised saying they had a leak during the night.
Breakfast was ok, even though we were below ground brighter lighting  would help. 
Not a great experience.",2,2023,07,02
219,Bad customer service and management of booking,"Booked three nights for me and the wife for her 50th. Booked a club suite months in advance. On arrival went to room and it was not what we booked, it was a downgrade cheaper room. They didn‚Äôt bother to tell us and just sent us up. When we complained they just said they were overbooked! How could that happen? Offered a free meal! Erm we paid 300 euros a night and you offer a dinner. Spoke to manager who offered 50 euro back and dinner but the trip had turned sour by then. As part of the club room you have access to club lounge and spa, coffee machine didn‚Äôt work and when we went for a spa, sauna steam etc nothing was working, rams through to reception and they said they would send someone, 20 minutes later still no one and there was 6 people just sitting there waiting so we gave up. On the emails sent it said a butler would take us to our room and show us how everything worked, nope didn‚Äôt happen. Reception didn‚Äôt really seemed to interested. For the price we paid would expect better service, just didn‚Äôt happen, wouldn‚Äôt recommend.",2,2023,07,02
219,The Address Connolly review June 23,"Super location right in the hearth of the city center, we were going to a concert so we literally walked across the street to Connolly train station. 
 We got an excellent room and importantly it is very quite as you are not surrounded by traffic. It is also evident that the staff have been well trained as the service was excellent.",5,2023,06,30
219,Poor customer service!,"Worst customer service in the only hotel I've been to in dublin! Not a good impression.
The front office staff seems inexperienced in terms of communication skills.
The hotel seems esthetically pleasing but lacks quality and service.",1,2023,06,30
219,Simply Dreadful.....,"I never write bad reviews but I honestly feel you are worth one, just a pretty dreadful experience all round!  The only welcoming member of staff at this hotel are the housekeeping staff, others especially the manager on duty just grunt at you if you raise any issue and there were plenty!  Rooms smelt of cigarettes, air con not working so heat was unbearable, train noise ridiculous, dinner was awful, breakfast was awful..have stayed in so many hotels in Dublin and this was genuinely the worst at 300 euro a night!  As someone else said below, just do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else, felt sorry for those checking in as I was leaving",1,2023,06,29
219,WORST 4 star hotel I have ever been in,"1. The room had nothing to do with the photos presented. We went to the reception to show the photos and they told us carpet was removed because the room is renovated, but nevertheless we did get the room we booked. We said this was an important aspect for us, as we relied on those photos. We also got a glimpse of the room across while someone was cleaning it and it looked much better and it had a carpet. Staff was clearly not willing to help, their attitude is not client-oriented, they just told us they have no rooms available and they can't do anything about it. No solution provided at all, not even an apology. Another lady was there at the same moment complaining it's the 3rd time she comes to say the AC is not working. The receptionist told us he will talk to his manager and let us know, but the next time he saw us, he just pretended he has something to do to avoid us. We realized we don't have any chance of solving this, so we didn't bother to approach again. So no, we were never contacted by any manager and got no follow-up from reception. And needless to say the bathtub had the encasing broken, the floor tiles were cracked, furniture was old and ragged, we had no water bottles in the room, which is a first for me. The bed is on wheels and if you move, it will move with you. Also, in the morning the rooms fills up with food smell, probably from the kitchen.
2. Breakfast was mediocre at best. Not too many choices and their pancake machine was not working. I found someone and told her, she said she will ask the chef to come see what's wrong. Of course no one came and we spent another 20mins there finishing up our plates. 
So, I don't know how in the world this is a 4 star hotel, I would definitely rate it a 3. Please start taking attitude towards them, as it is clear they do not have any respect for paying customers and they rely on old reputation and do not consider improvements are highly necessary. I also will make a complaint to Failte Ireland, as their ""the ultimate 4 star hotel experience"" is a HUGE overstatement.",2,2023,06,25
219,Address Connelly-aesthetically pleasing but not good function,"Hotel is beautiful and the employees are very attentive however, at peak summer season the rooms do not cool off and it‚Äôs terrible. I believe the four-star rating is exaggerated as they‚Äôre only a few rooms that fit on the club level that seem to fit a four-star rating. But, you still don‚Äôt have a truly functional air conditioning and it‚Äôs HOT",2,2023,06,22
219,"No service, no knowledge of their rooms","We had a very frustrating experience there. First, the room had noise from the trains even though we were on the 8th floor. Our phone line was dead. We had no Wi-Fi access in our room. There was a bad smell in the bathroom. The air-conditioning worked only on high or higher with no temperature control. There was a stain on the carpet. We asked to change rooms but could not until the next day. That morning I asked to speak to the Assistant Manager and I asked him to ensure that our next room would not have the same problems. But the new room we were assigned was just next to the previous one and also had a dead telephone line and no Wi-Fi. I tried to phone the front desk from my mobile but the hotel operator never answered. I returned to the front desk and was told that the Assistant Manager would come up to check. But he never showed up. Laundry and garbage bags were stored all day in the fairly narrow hallways. The hotel breakfast was OK but crowded. We had booked a Club room ‚Äì the Club lounge provides cold breakfast in the morning but the rest of the day only coffee and tea, and old oranges and apples with brown stains. It is a shame that this hotel has gone downhill ‚Äì they apparently survive based on their previous reputation and the tour groups. ",1,2023,06,19
219,Short break,"This hotel is well situated in the city , it has good links to the train & tram networks.
Check-in can be busy so may take longer than you would expect.
The rooms are of a very good quality , with all the things you would want , inc an Iron , a bath, tea/coffee facilities.
The king size bed was very comfy , the room has modern lighting with touch buttons , also a motion sensor under bedsides should you require the bathroom at night.
Breakfast is well stocked across both hot & cold options , the room it‚Äôs in however is ‚Äúcosy‚Äù so if it‚Äôs busy will feel cramped.",4,2023,06,18

AirCon never worked although advertised and was a core reason we booked. Didn't sleep at all due to sweating in a tiny box at 31 degrees with a window which opened just a smidge. TV was broke, Wi-Fi was broke, room was dirty, never got cleaned by the maids during our stay, bathroom floods due to show fittings and the staff are so unhelpful it was actually astonishing. Complained and was promised a 25% refund, never got it and have given up chasing.",1,2023,06,15
219,"5 star price, 2 star stay.","
The bad:
- Air conditioning fan couldn't be regulated, cyclone strength was the only setting and noisy! 
- They supply tea bags but not a kettle.
- No bottled water.
- Bathroom fan had no off switch and noisy all day and night. 
- Fridge could not be turned down to a cold enough temperature to chill drinks. 
- wifi didn't work in the room or on the TV so couldn't watch streaming services.
- reported all issues to staff either nothing was done or couldn't be fixed.
- The ""address lounge"" was a boiling hot (40 deg C) pointless room; the coffee machine was out of service, no service person up there, no refreshments, nothing to eat, it was basically just a balcony with a horrendous view. 

The good:
- comfy beds and bedding
- modern bathrooms
- clean room
- electric curtains
- breakfast was ok - 3 out of 5

I would look for somewhere else, not worth it for the price they charge. ",1,2023,06,14
219,Amazing 1st Anniversary Surprise,"Was brought to the address by my husband on our 1st year anniversary.

On arrival we where greeted and smiles and congratulations on our anniversary ‚ù§Ô∏è.

We then went up to our room and where overwhelmed with it all. Flowers, Chocolates, persecco all layed out, thanks Trisha and the wonderful team for setting it up with so much attention to detail.

Later that day we went down for our meal and it was delightful, from the moment of arriving  we where sat and looked after. From the manager on the floor to Tais the lovely waitress which helped with recommendations of what to have. 

We could not of asked for a better get away thank you all so much and can't wait to see you all very soon.",5,2023,06,05

219,So much potential not yet relaised,"We arrived to check in at agreed time and had to wait 2.5 hours for our room. We weren't the only ones. The day after our arrival the same thing happened, a lobby full of disgruntled guests waiting for their rooms. As a consequence we missed the first thing we had planned for our stay in Dublin because we couldn't get in to our room to get showered and changed. The room was very clean and comfortable but unfortunately one of the double mattresses had a dip in it and was uncomfortable unless we used pillows to make it level. We were in Dublin to celebrate my 50th birthday and my ftiend had arranged for a bottle of fizz to be on the room on arrival. This had been forgotten in the rush of getting rooms ready and my friend had to remond them. She had paid for this online but the hotel tried to charge her for this again on departure. The hotel brasserie was bright and attractive and the Irish liqueur coffees were wonderful. The hotel is fabulously located and has so much potential. It just isn't OK at the moment. Hopefully this will improve. Having said all of this - I would give the hotel another chance if I returned to Dublin. We all have our off days. ",3,2023,06,03
219,Never again ! Look at photos.,"I hate writing poor reviews , but given that I have emailed the General Manager of this hotel and not been given the courtesy of a reply, then I shall now publicise my complaint.
For context we are having a holiday driving around Ireland and have stayed in 5 hotels - all superb , I‚Äôve reviewed them all. But this one is not !
Once a hotel advertises itself as 4* Luxury Hotel in the Heart of Dublin, then you expect them to live up to that !
Sorry , not what myself and my husband found at all.
1.First of all it is NOT in the heart of Dublin, it is in a very dirty run down outskirts of the city.There are people sleeping rough directly directly opposite under the bridge, which is unnerving as you have to walk this way to the Public car park.
2. Check in was a nightmare. Slow, Our room wasn‚Äôt ready ( 4 pm ) so she found us another one Room 339, said it was exactly the same , just one floor difference.
The view from the window was a graffiti wall and 20+ (yes 20 ) trains an hour pass within 5 metres of the window ( see my photos )
The lampshade was filthy and water stained.
The whole room ( lights , TV, curtains etc )can only be operated by Wifi . These work ok ( apart from the darn low lights that keep coming on at night if as much as the edge of your quilt breaks the beam ). HOWEVER. THE Wifi is very poor for personal usage on tablets, phone etc. I tried logging out etc as the manager told me to, but no difference whatsoever.
We came back one day late afternoon , the room hadn‚Äôt been serviced. I rang reception , no one EVER answers.on my way down to reception I saw the housekeeping manager and she said she‚Äôd sort it ( she did ). So I went and sat in reception while it was cleaned. When I mentioned it to reception , she said they are only serviced every other day !
Back at the room the housekeeper said this is not true 
So - who is telling the truth ?
Mind you this same receptionist said she make us a booking in the restaurant - and she didn‚Äôt , so ‚Ä¶..
The breakfasts are ok, not as good as all the other hotels. The breakfast  was like a Sauna, no air con on.
My husband used one of the Public toilets around 7:45 pm, It had already been signed as inspected for 8 pm - however no loo rolls in any of the 2 cubicles.
I did comment about some of these points to the duty manager, and he gave us 2 complimentary drinks with diner. A nice gesture, however I would never ever stay here again.
They seem to cater for huge Coach loads of tour companies ( their bread and butter bookings naturally )
 So- there you are. How happy we were to leave that hotel.

219,"Clean, safe, friendly, quiet, staff were lovely and respectful","Clean, safe, quiet, friendly staff. Very well organised and efficient. Helped with any questions I had and were able to answer. Breakfast was beautiful and plenty. Felt very safe and modern accomodation. Facilities were all great and I would highly recommend.",5,2023,05,31
219,Nope not again,"Definitely would not stay here again.  Upon check-in which my travel documents showed as 2pm checkin they would not let me check in until 3.  They did store my luggage while we toured Dublin.  When we returned about 9pm, the room they provided us was occupied although our key worked.  I returned to inform the staff and they made me feel as though I was wrong and I had to repeat myself twice.  I received another room and that suite did not have working ac and the sliding glass door would not open to let in air.  They would not change my room, brought a non working fan but eventually a mobile ac unit around midnight.  The night staff was kind enough but befuddled.  The day staff I‚Äôd prefer not to interact and lack customer skills.  The hotel can‚Äôt do anything about their location but you need to know you‚Äôll have to park near the harbor and carry your luggage about 15 min and some under a bridge with a lot of pigeons and bird poop.   Just know that it‚Äôs a pain!",1,2023,05,26
219,A Hotel Worth The Stay,The address is an excellent hotel.  Beautifully decorated and with every conceivable option laid on for a sumptuous stay.  I had a room on the 9th and the view across Dublin is worth it.  Breakfast was well cooked with top notch ingredients.  I would highly recommend this hotel it is in the centre of Dublin so expect hordes of people around the streets but there are numerous shops to attract.,5,2023,05,25
219,Expensive for a badly looked after hotel in a rough area,"In summary, the place is badly maintained and in a dingy area
At check in (90mins after check in is available) we were told our room may not be ready yet.  They did manage to find an alternative after a while, which lost us the chance to refresh before our tour in Dublin but never mind.
The room was stifling so we put the aircon on.  When we came back at the end of the evening the room was nice and cool, but there was now a small lake in the middle of the floor, under the aircon grill.  If you are in 762 best keep that area clear of any of your possessions.  I did report this at check out but your guess is as good as mine.
The decor was generally good but maintenance is clearly an issue.  The bath panel had once been sealed by someone with no concept of how to do so - gooey lumps of sealant all down the wall.  Someone else appeared to have had a go at the bath (perhaps to mend the plug, which still didn't work).  They had succeeded in leaving great gaps and exposing their colleague's artwork with the sealant.  I also guess the screw on the floor was part of the fixings which they'd not managed to fathom out.
The area is grim - we are two adult males, one grew up in Birmingham, one in Leeds.  We were really uneasy walking between the hotel and the city centre, and I would definitely not recommend if you are alone or not prepared to hold your own.  We detoured past the Garda station on the way back, which felt a little better.
Redeeming feature is breakfast.  It's a large hotel but breakfast was varied, plentiful and fresh.  The staff at breakfast were also cheerful and helpful.
Travelled as father and adult son",2,2023,05,23
219,"Excellent experience, highly recommended!","The staff was super friendly. The hotel is very stylish, with warm lights and tastefully decorated. Its spotless and modern, yet also with charme. 
The hotel has a club lounge on the 7th  floor which we could use (complimentary upgrade). The hotel bar and adjusting restaurant also looked inviting. 
Its across from the train station, but the building and windows are so well isolated, you hardly notice the passing trains, making it a very convenient location for further travels.
We wished we could have stayed longer. It felt like a real little holiday.",5,2023,05,20
219,Bruce Springstein Concert,"Fabulous Hotel just reopened an refurbed just few teething problems to be expected but for a location it's got everything on doorstep, Taxi, Bus, luas, Train and lovely Hotel and staff are great especially in the breakfast lounge they are 5* really looked after us well and lovely staff to I totally recommend this 4* Hotel whicj is quit busy so plan early
",5,2023,05,11
219,"Central Location, Great Staff, Very Comfy, Highly Recommend","The Address Connolly is a lovely hotel very well located in Dublin with super helpful staff and very comfy, spacious rooms.  
Our visit was to see Bruce Springsteen on his final tour date in Ireland and just as we were headed off to the Dart to get the train the heavens opened.  I cannot fault the staff, one gentleman in particular who worked in the reception area (I wish I had got his name) who went out and got us a cab in the utterly driving rain so we could head  over to the concert dry and quickly.  Nothing was too much trouble.

Breakfast was plentiful and there were lots of options.  Very impressed with the various milks and the area where you could add nuts/seeds etc to your breakfast.  Fruit a plenty and lots of options for anyone who likes a hot option.  

Highly recommend the hotel.

",5,2023,05,11
219,Anywhere but here. ,"Hotel has a major major problem with AC - doesn‚Äôt work and unbelievably loud.  Showers water is scalding hot and you cannot adjust.  Reception pretends the issue is going to be resolved. They do nothing.  Room was unbearably hot and all our friends (4 rooms total) said the same. Two moved to another hotel. Eventually I got another room with AC.  

Do not stay here.  ",1,2023,05,07
219,PROCEED with CAUTION ‚ö†Ô∏è,"CAUTION, We reserved a room for 6 days. We lasted 2. Room # 864. The air conditioner was so loud, I was unable to sleep, shutting it off made the room unbearably stuffy and hot.
The shower water was so hot and unadjustable, I love a hot shower but this was dangerous. We had two lights in our room that has some type of short so they flickered when the room lights were on. I complained to the front desk on the first day and they said they would send someone to take care of the air and lights. The young man they sent up was not able to take care of it. They stated they would send up a portable air conditioner that day. Never arrived! I asked to speak with a manager and waited all day nothing. The next day, I spoke with the manager Borislav, he told me he would come up to look into the room issues and would try and find us a different room that evening or the next day. Again, we waited and he never showed or called. 
Got up the next morning and found a new hotel. Really a grand disappointment and I feel bad for the staff, they need trying and leadership. I have contacted my credit card company to file a dispute for the charges.",1,2023,05,07
219,Very nice hotel in Dublin,Great location in front of train station and close to bus terminal. We can enjoy warm and tasteful breakfast. One problem is a few rooms are in front of train tracks therefore we may hear trains running very very frequently. It‚Äôs better to put pre-request to avoid such room in reservation.,5,2023,05,05
219,Very negative experience,"I ws there at the end of April 2023 for professional reasons. Terrible experience. Breakfast in windowless area (-1), unsufficient cleaning service in the room and wrong charge on my credit card without any refund (after 3 weeks) and communication/clarification.",1,2023,05,04
219,Overcharged,"Lovely hotel, great location and had a superb meal in the restaurant. Sadly the few days away were ruined when I was charged ¬£190 for the room on departure having pre-paid for the booking in Feb. The accounts dept admitted their error and a few days later rather than refunding me I was charged for a 3rd time. Eventually got my ¬£380 refund back but good few pounds out of pocket due to exchange rates and bank charges. Sent an email to claim back these costs and got no response so I won‚Äôt be back. ",2,2023,05,04
219,Perfect experience.,We were attended by Isabel very well. She was an excelent profesional and person. The Hotel was very good. Well located in the city. Very good transport conections. Kindly people at reception. We slept very confortable. ,5,2023,05,01
219,Deceiving !!,Want to use the gym ? Pay 20 euros. Elevators are separated by class. You need to have a more expensive room to get one that actually works. Want air conditioning or heat but your wall unit won‚Äôt turn on ? Sure they say they will send someone up to fix it and then totally ignore your request. Breakfast is not included. Noisy area. Good luck figuring out how to turn on the shower. Horrible experience.,2,2023,05,01
219,If you think you‚Äôre getting a deal - you‚Äôre not!!,Not a good experience for our first time in Dublin. Upon arrival our room was not ready at the 3pm check in. And looking around the lobby we were not the only ones with this issue. They gave us an upgraded room but I‚Äôm not sure it was an upgrade as the temperature in the room was extremely warm and no one came to check on it as promised. We had to sleep with balcony door open while listening to the noise of Dublin. felt our concerns were ignored. The elevator broke during our stay and we could only use the exclusive ‚ÄúClub Elevator ‚Äú when we were able to find someone to help. Speaking of club‚Ä¶the hotel advertises a fitness center but that too is only for ‚ÄúClub Members‚Äù. In all my years of travel this is the first I‚Äôve seen where I‚Äôve had to pay extra to use an average fitness center. Not sure why this place is 4 stars.,2,2023,04,30
219,STAY WELL CLEAR!!!,"STAY CLEAR!!! Absolute dump of a hotel small dingy rooms disgusting food in the hotel got a rump steak medium rare came rare, pepper sauce just tasted of burnt, chips were covered in salt thought I was going to have a stroke eating them desert and starters were also disgusting more sauce than chicken with the bbq chicken wings, just caught smoke coming through my air vents and it smells of cheap forgien fags now.",1,2023,04,29
219,Noisy and smelly,"Certainly not a 4 star hotel in my book! Room window about 6 foot away from a busy train line with poor soundproofing. Musty smell coming from the ventilation system. No shampoo in the refill bottle. Well able to charge the high Dublin rates, but not backed up with a 4 star rating. Disappointed ",1,2023,04,28
219,Opening weekend woes- but otherwise great spot,"We stayed the first weekend they had re-opened to the public in the beginning of April.  There were a lot of growing pains.  NO ONE was allowed to check in before 3pm, and at that point the lobby was full and it was a matter of pushing yourself up to the desk to get someone's attention to give you a room.  

The elevators are confusing (there are two sets of keys- one for the room and one for the elevator- and we didn't get both at check-in, which further complicated things.  

The staff were clearly not ready to open- the elevator doors would open to a lift crammed to the ceiling with chairs, boxes were in the hallways, rooms were bare, towels and tea were delivered to our room later in the evening.

However... after all of the chaos of getting in it was a lovely room.  Extremely comfortable beds, linens seemed new, and it was very quiet.

Location is great if you are taking the train.  A bit of a walk if you are going towards Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc. but a totally walkable town.  The area does feel a bit sketchy once the businesses close up at night but we had no problems.  We would definitely stay here again (and hopefully some of the kinks will have been worked out)",4,2023,04,27
219,Really cool,"The hotel was really quiet and in a good spot.

The bed in the room was really comfortable and I slept very well.

The breakfast was really good and I love the idea of the pancake machine.

Even the dinner at the hotel was really good.

I racommend it to everybody üòä",4,2023,04,25
219,Get the club sambo ü§©,"We had lunch today in the Address Hotel. We were met by a lady called Trisha, who was very welcoming. I asked for a table of 5. The place was packed with full tables of between 2-10+ people, however Trisha was able to squeeze us in at such short notice. The food was amazing, I got a club sandwich which came with chips, my friends got the same and also some got pizza‚Äôs. One of my friends is vegetarian and he was able to pick something from the menu aswell. The service was amazing and we will be returning. Ask for Trisha ü§©",5,2023,04,20
219,City getaway,"Stayed here for two nights and utterly enjoyed it, once checked in we went to the bar for lunch. Food was good, and staff very helpful and attentive. Rare to see a manager doing a bit of graft and he made sure everything was looked after with our meal and this goes through the hotel where the senior staff are seen not as just managing they do there bit helping with customer needs.

Service with a smile and staff offering to assist with checking in and out, explaining how to use the smart bedroom, to holding bags, storing bags or simply advising us on what facilities they had to offer.

prices where very good for the what you get back, and customer service was excellent morning and night. 

We had breakfast on the roof terrace and in the breakfast room, both times we where greeted by the lovely breakfast staff at 9am, I know its hard to get cheerful at this time but they did, and copious amounts of food on offer from a fry to fruit and pastries.

The building is newly renovated and you can tell as its very aesthetically pleasing, with the spa just done, we didn‚Äôt know ourselves in there and could of stayed all day in that Jacuzzi pool.

After the evening spent in the spa with the wife we agreed to definitely return here on our next visit to the city weather its for work or pleasure.

Thanks to the staff for a great experience and we hope to see you again soon.",5,2023,04,16
219,"Great hotel, comfiest beds!","We booked this hotel for a two night stay in Dublin which included a visit to the 3 arena to watch a concert. The hotel was located in a good location, 20 mins walk from the arena and around 10-15 mins walk from the temple bar area. 

The hotel itself was very nice. Modern decor and well decorated. We were upgraded to an address club room and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Room had smart controls which meant you could control everything easily. Coffee machine also a nice touch. The only problem we had was although our phones connected to the WiFi it didn't really work. All staff very friendly and helpful.

We had breakfast included and the selection was good. However, the temperature of the food could have been hotter, could beans are not good. We went into the McGettigans Cookhouse for a drink but we did not eat, restaurant very nice though.

If I returned to Dublin I would return to this hotel.",5,2023,04,16
219,Nice Address for a stay in Dublin!,"Very nice hotel. Clean hotel and friendly staff. The room was also clean and nice bed linnen. And had all facilities you expect from a 4 Star hotel. The gym was a great moment to start the day. And one evening we eat very well at the McGETTIGANS cookhouse. And stayed at the bar, with a nice atmosphere what you expect in a city like Dublin. But also opportunities to eat around the hotel.",5,2023,04,16
219,It‚Äôs alright for a quick gig stay.,"We stayed here while attending a gig at the 3Arena as the location is more than ideal and the price couldn‚Äôt be beaten.  

The reception area is really nicely decorated. Trains can be heard arriving and departing (what sounds like overheads) at Connolly station within the reception area. 

The room (at least the one we had) was quite small but had a lovely view over the city. Floor to ceiling windows and a touch panel to open/close the curtains. 

My complaints about the room (and the hotel) in general is that it‚Äôs very warm. Turning the AC down to the lowest, didn‚Äôt seem to make much of an effect (it seemed to be blowing ambient and non cooled air.) It feels like they have the heating on constantly here all over the hotel. 

There‚Äôs also a horrible smell from the pipes/drainage here. I had thought it was only our room, so we let the bathroom air but I also noticed it in the bathrooms in McGettigans too. 

Food is only ok. It‚Äôs absolutely nothing to write home about. When staff asked if we wanted condiments, I asked for garlic mayonnaise - was told they don‚Äôt have it (but a different server got it for the table next to us - the only reason I asked was because I seen the lady next to us got it.) Asked for pepper sauce (since I had a steak burner) - was told they also don‚Äôt have it. 

Drinks are okay, but, couldn‚Äôt make most of the cocktails as they had no syrup and when asked to make a classic (off menu, but margarita) was told they didn‚Äôt know how. On saying that, the older gentleman who served us until midnight was a gent. Had great conversation with him, an asset to the hotel. 

Reception staff (particularly an older lady) are quite rude too, speaking in their own language (Spanish) override guests. Not great. 

I would return, based on the price and location and cleanliness.",3,2023,04,14
219,Looks can be deceiving ‚Ä¶,"This 4* I‚Äôm not sure about? Yes the hotel is aesthetically pleasing, but it is a shame it does NOT follow through with quality of staff service, broken coffee machines, stains on bedroom carpet, faulty toilet. Poor menu and quality of food for dinner service and a cold cooked breakfast with poor quality coffee and juice, and grumpy breakfast staff. ",3,2023,04,14
219,First Time in Dublin!,"Beautiful accommodations and wonderful staff.  All major sites are easily walkable from this location and cabs are easy to find.  The service was wonderful from arrival to departure, and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. ",5,2023,04,10
219,Review,"I rarely write reviews but had to with this experience. After a flight delay from the US, our taxi cab brought us to the Address Connolly. On arrival we realised this was not the correct hotel. Thankfully a lovely young man named Luke was there to assist at the front desk. He explained the hotel was closed but provided us with directions to our new hotel and even assisted in organising a taxi to the correct hotel. Will definitely stay here if we ever come back to visit Dublin Ireland again",4,2023,01,07
219,Great hotel,Visited as a couple in 2021. Beautiful hotel. Spacious rooms and very comfy beds! Great location with train station nearby (this did not cause any noise issues). Very clean hotel and restaurant attached had really tasty food! Will visit again.,5,2022,11,22
219,Great hotel.  Lovely staff,It is an awful pity that this hotel has been taken over by the Ukrainian refugees for the foreseeable future.  It was a lovely comfortable hotel with good food.  The staff are first class and look after the guests very well.,5,2022,09,01
219,Cancel,"Got an email to say room had been cancelled even though I booked a non cancelable room
Didn't give a reason or no telephone call
Eventually got through to hotel and fair enough they are accomodating Ukraines but a telephone call or reason for cancellation would've been more effective customer service
Also I was paying 300 euros for one night and now hotels are all over 500 euro for one night so looks like our night away and event may not be happening.",1,2022,05,21
219,Booking in High Season got cancelled,"Received an email to say our 2 night booking for 4 people in August was cancelled. No suggestions or help finding other accommodation. Flights are already booked, so good luck finding another room.
I value acts of charity, but to shut down one of the best hotels in town in high season and cancel the guests is not a good idea.",1,2022,05,10
219,Do NOT book here unless you want your stay cancelled and left with no accommodation,Had a booking for a night stay for an event for which we have bought flights and tickets and have now had an email cancelling a NON cancelable rate stay with no help to find another room and prices now ¬£500 per night for anything left available. Whilst there is a laudable aspect to the Ukraine assistance customers need to know NOT to book here if they need to stay in Dublin as YOU will be cancelled and left high and dry.,1,2022,05,10
219,Amazing Stay,Wanted a special hotel to celebrate a special birthday. After extensive research decided to book The Address Connolly and it did not disappoint. Great location too - approx 10 minutes walk from the centre. Opted for a suite which was outstanding. From the spacious surroundings to the attention to detail of the decor in the room was perfect. The automatic curtains and night lights are a nice touch. The staff were incredibly helpful and accommodated a request for balloons to be put in the room upon check in together with some complimentary chocolates. The breakfast was very good apart from the last day where they ran out of butter‚Ä¶not a fan of dry toast! Apart from that could not fault our stay and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend and will indeed stay here again when we are next in Dublin.,5,2022,04,28
219,Worst customer service,Stayed here and the feont desk older blond manager was arrogant and dismissive. She could not take the time to answer any questions or had the common courtesy to speak to you as a person. Unpleasant!!,1,2022,04,01
219,Exceptional service and staff,"This hotel is exceptional, the staff give a very friendly welcoming service where nothing is a problem and no request too large. I have been a regular at this hotel from the middle of last year until they kindly closed their doors to accept Ukrainian refugees! I dealt mostly with Isabelle and she is the most warm friendly person she really is an asset. the rooms are spacious and always very clean. They are soundproof and you feel like you‚Äôre in your own little bubble even though you have the city outside your door! The food in the bar and grill is very high quality and room service with a smile :). I will miss staying here very much over the coming months but will definitely be returning when they have finished with their good work üíï",5,2022,03,31
219,Wouldn‚Äôt book again!,"Received an email to say our 2 night booking for 10 people in April was cancelled. No suggestions or help finding other accommodation so at such late notice we‚Äôve ended up paying another ¬£500 and further out of the centre. 
Thanks The Address and thanks booking.com!!!",1,2022,03,17
219,Don‚Äôt bother. Rude unfriendly staff,"Landed at 10pm, got to hotel just before 11 and told no booking, states booking.com cancelled it, the actual hotel cancelled it and looks like Booking.com have not been informed. The lady at the reception was rude and unhelpful, not willing to help us find another hotel or provide any kind of support, kept telling us to contact booking.com but we couldn‚Äôt as had problem with internet access,  eventually found another hotel which cost more but May have been a godsend as the staff at the new hotel were lovey and was a better hotel, even if they start allowing bookings for this hotel in the future I wouldn‚Äôt book it due to the manner the staff member was.",1,2022,03,15
219,Good hotel let down by reception staff.,"We stayed here on Sat 12th of March and our first impression was not a good one. The check in was chaotic, and we were left to feel like an inconvenience to the front desk staff. The staff member we dealt with could not find our booking even though I had confirmed it on 2 different occasions and was able to show the emails and reference numbers. 
In my opinion the front desk staff need some basic training on how to deal with guests and how important first impressions are. I understand that the reception area was a little chaotic, but that shouldn't prevent staff using basic manners when dealing with guests. 

The hotel itself is very nice, the reception has lovely d√©cor, the room was almost perfect, the only issue was the air con kept turning itself on. Location is very central and has a luas(tram) stop just around the corner. Breakfast buffet was very good. 
Check out was easy. 
I would definitely stay in this hotel again, I'm only marking it down because of the check in process but feel this set the tone for the entire stay.",3,2022,03,15
219,very helpfully and willing to help,"so i booked this hotel via booking.com and we got down and found out that our booking had been canceled due to them taking in refugees from ukraine which i have no iuess with ( good on them to do this) the girls on the front desk helped us with all the problems what booking.com was giving us who btw didnt bother to tell us that the room was canceled they where very helpfully and offered us tea and stuff and got us a taxi to our new hotel 10 outa 10 would book with them again

If anything it‚Äôs made me want to come back and give some money to this hotel in future! Amazing worküëèüëèüëè",5,2022,03,09
219,Canceled with little to no warning,"Would not recommend, canceled our stay with no warning less than a week before check-in. I understand the circumstances and applaud them for taking in refugees. However canceling bookings that had been made for 5+ months, with no warning, during one of the busiest holidays/festivals, not helping customers find other lodgings or even recommend other/partner hotels. 

Now scrambling to find other lodgings, and will have to pay a huge increase because it‚Äôs last minute and holiday. Extremely disappointed.",1,2022,03,08
219,Nice and cozy hotel,"The room was newly renovated, but the heating using on AC was a little ineffective. No water in the room, although promised. Very nice breakfast, good coffee. Wonderful location to visit and spend the night out.",4,2022,03,08
219,One night stay - very comfortable,"Check in was super quick and easy with lovely staff. Attention to detail was evident in the room. The room was amazing, very modern, bright and everything was so simple to use. Staff are wonderful and very very helpful. We were able to avail of the late check out option which was super handy for the bad hangover Sunday! All in all 10/10!! Cannot wait to stay again some time :)",5,2022,03,07
219,Paul kelly,Everything was good until Saturday morning when no hot water. On Sunday the sheets were not clean and neither was the room. When I told reception I was told that there was nothing they could do. I would have liked to stay again but it needs better cummuincation from staff when someone has a complaint to make  ,3,2022,03,01
219,address Feb 2022,Room very clean and facilities such as Wi-Fi tv etc. very good. The bars were friendly and food was of a good standard. Draught beer was limited to only a few choices though. Whereas the accommodation was of great quality and right opposite Connolly station it must be noted that the surrounding area was neither appealing nor inviting and residents should take note when booking in future. ,4,2022,02,28
219,Disgraceful,"Myself and my partner stayed here, we had a deal booked with a meal included, the meal in Mc getting and bar was disgusting and had to be sent back, no alternative offered. 249 euro, then no shower working and very badly stained mattress which I only noticed on leaving.",1,2022,02,28
219,Great stay!,Had the loveliest stay at the address connolly hotel. Staff were so friendly. David who worked in the restaurant couldn't have been nicer and was extremely accomodating! I would definitely recommend a visit to this hotel! Thank youüëç,5,2022,02,20
219,"A mixed bag, but overall a bit dissapointing and probably won't stay again","Some pros to start: great location, very stylish and lovely reception, bar and restaurant areas, great food and drinks at bar and restaurant, comfy bed, decent interior in room, nice enough staff for most part.
Small mix up with booking at their end which they couldn't have handled a bit more nicely.
Cons: TV didn't work properly throughout 4 night stay (poor signal), last 2 nights couldn't really watch anything on it, no glasses or wine glasses in room, no shampoo, no lotion, cleaning quite sloppy (dust in corners of room and bathroom), net curtains grey from dust/not washed for ages, very limited tea/coffee in room.
Our room was 168 and next to a massive laundry vent and dirty windows with bars-horrible outlook, we kept curtains always drawn which felt like we live in a cave for 4 days. Couldn't open window due to steam coming from the vent.Noise from vent and woken up each morning around 7am from laundry spinning machines/dryers nearby. Could hear trains passing but not too loud, could have slept through that, but not the nosy vent and laundry room.
Overall, for the price (approx ¬£110 per night), we wouldn't stay again and would choose a Holiday Inn or the like. Booked this place because we were taken by the cool interiors in pics.",3,2022,02,20
219,Fantastic Dublin City Hotel,"Excellent overnight stay with a friend.  From the point of entering the Reception area to the time we left, great service.  All staff and management very attentive.  Bar has a lovely setting and able to have a few drinks before dinner, also in the same area.  Barman making the Cocktails was well trained in his field.
Food to a very high standard and beautiful.",5,2022,02,17
219,SHANI STUMKE 50TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION WEEKEND,"I must congratulate all your staff, they were wonderful. Diana at Reception, the lady in charge of the dining room and just all (also Linda) who were involved in making it a memorable weekend.  Arranging room 565 for my son and daughter-in-law - thank you for the birthday card for Shani and the drinks voucher, which unfortunately we did not use as we ran out of time.  But there will be a next time!  Thank you again for a MOST MEMORABLE STAY IN YOUR LOVELY HOTEL.",5,2022,02,15
219,Has a lot of lessons to be learnt,"Went to Dublin for a few days and decided to stay at The Address Connolly ‚Ä¶ I wish I hadn‚Äôt. 
On arrival to the hotel I tried to check in but the hotel didn‚Äôt have my booking. They asked me to send over my booking confirmation which I did. When I sent it over they were still having issues so they took me to the bar and got me a complimentary drink whilst they were sorting the issue out.
I sat in the bar for 2 1/2 hours before anyone came back to see me. The only reason they came back to me was because of David at the bar. The duty manager spoke to me and said they were still struggling to find my booking. He said he was talking to the reservation manager to get the issue resolved. All the duty manager kept saying was that there was no booking and he couldn‚Äôt do anything else.
Another half hour passed and still nothing until the duty manager came back again and told me the only way I would get a room was to pay for the room even though as I had explained to him I already had a booking. The duty manager was not interested in trying to sort the issue out and in the end said if I wanted to talk anymore that I would need to go to reception to see him.
I then called lastminute.com where I had booked the hotel spoke to them and they confirmed I had a booking and sent it over to the hotel for a fourth time.
As I was getting annoyed with no resolution from the hotel I then phoned the agent myself to get the situation resolved. Whilst I was on the phone to them they heard the duty manager telling me there was nothing I can do and that I was in the wrong and didn‚Äôt have a booking, the agent on the phone said that if the duty manager didn‚Äôt sort the issue within two minutes they would cancel my booking there and rebook me another hotel room elsewhere. 
The issue was finally sorted after 3 1/2 hours of waiting. When the duty manager finally got the booking sorted he offered no apology and didn‚Äôt offer anything as a goodwill gesture from the hotel for the time I had waited.
When I then finally got to my room half of the TV channels did not work there was no tea facilities as it said there was and the fridge did not work. By this point I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to speak to the duty manager anymore so I just ignored the issues.
The next day I then went to try and use the gym and sauna facilities which were included within the booking and was not able to use either as they as there was tools being stored in there even though no work was happening in either area. 
All in all a very disappointing experience for a hotel which I had high hopes for. I don‚Äôt think I will be returning any time soon, if at all unless there are some serious changes to how issues are dealt with and the duty manager learns a few lessons in Customer Service, hospitality and showing compassion when a customer has been waiting 3 1/2 hours!",1,2022,02,14
219,Incredible Girls trip,"Me and my girlfriend stayed for a night for a girls valentines night ü•∞ we got the get the gang together package where we got a night stay, 3 course dinner, free cocktail and breakfast in the morning. Everything was awesome and food was amazing in the cookhouse! I wanna commend Isabelle our receptionist who was amazing with our check in and check out!! So friendly and helpful! and Tajana was so sweet to us during breakfast and gave us exactly what we were looking for!! Overall hotel was amazing and staff were great, definitely coming back again!! üéâ‚ú®",5,2022,02,14
219,First class,"Perfect location, spotless hotel with friendly staff. Right next to train station.... Literally across the street!! This was my second visit to The Address and I will most definitely be back. Would 100% recommend this hotel ",5,2022,02,12
219,Lovely Hotel,"We had a lovely stay here at the beginning of February. Hotel was lovely, clean and staff were very helpful and friendly. On check-in we were given a free room upgrade which was a lovely surprise. Room was very nice, modern, clean and the bed was huge. Hotel was only a 10 minute walk to O'Connell Street Upper and just a little further over the river to Temple Bar area. Overall a great hotel in a great location within walking distance to good pubs and bars. ",5,2022,02,10
219,Amazing rooms and pleasant staff,"Me, my gf and a group of friends went to the Address Connolly for my gfs birthday this weekend. 

I was ready to leave a neutral/bad review even before visiting as when we asked if they could do anything special for us before attending and they sent a list back of how we can buy extras. I thought it was just the type of hotel that tries getting as much money as possible from you but that wasn't the case.

We paid ¬£162 per night which is pretty standard for the type of hotel, but on our arrival we were told all three of our rooms were upgraded to VIP and we have a continental breakfast thrown in too ! A nice start to the weekend.

The staff member who dealt with us was Isabel, she was very friendly and seemed to have some attachment to my surname and make a fuss about it, in a nice way. She made us all feel welcome and we checked in around 9am, pretty good to say most hotels do not let you check in until 2 ish.

The hotel location could be a little more central, but we went for a bit of a boozy weekend, so wasn't too much of an issue. Saturday day we made our way into town by hitting most pubs/bars we saw, so the walk was not too bad. 

The rooms are smart rooms, very spacious and very comfortable. All our party stated if we went to Dublin again we would stay here. If you thinking of a trip to Dublin, I'd consider give the Address Connolly a go!",5,2022,02,07
219,Good accommodation in Dublin,"Nice hotel in general. Good location. Nice vibe and great staff. But it‚Äôs a pity that the mattress was like a hammock (in other words absolutely worn and collapsed, which was just awful, in spite of the lovely linen), and the bathroom had lots wrong, like a broken toilet roll holder, poor flush mechanism, a door that could not close, and the whole bathroom badly needs retiling and grouting. Breakfast was very average and could be greatly improved. European plugs would have been a plus, as we could not charge our devices. ",3,2022,02,06
219,Rugby weekend,"Fantastic location at Connolly Train Station, amazing bar food good menu, freshly cooked nothing too much couldn‚Äôt do more to make my experience enjoyable, very pleasant staff extremely helpful, a special thank you to David such a knowledgeable bar man, who from getting us seated, going through food menu and assisting us with the wine choice - a gentleman so Funny while being extremely professional in an extremely busy service, you made everything perfect! Very clean spacious rooms with touch card entry, executive lounge with roof top view to relax in, quire beer garden area, enclosed away from the street with ample seating..",5,2022,02,06
219,A friendly and pleasant stay at Dublin,"Very good location, close to shops and to the center of Dublin for a walk. Very calm. I would like to highlight Isabel for her kindness and magnificent attention, who attended us at reception in an exceptional way.
Perhaps you should pay more attention to cleaning the windows to the patio, as was the case in my room.",5,2022,02,01
219,"Lovely Hotel, friendly staff","This is a lovely hotel, lovely room, reception staff excellent - couldn't do enough for us.
However, my only issue was no daily housekeeping service.  The bins were not emptied whilst we were there, thus ended up overflowing; the tea cups could only be washed by us under the bathroom sink taps, and we had to ask each day for extra tea bags and milk.
In a hotel of this calibre, I would have expected this as a minimum.",4,2022,01,31
219,Excellent Hotel,"This was our second visit to this hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful and immaculate, the staff are very welcoming, and are very helpful. We had dinner in their restaurant which was amazing and again staff very friendly and helpful! 
Highly recommended! ",5,2022,01,31
219,A must stay,Wonderful place! The staff definitely makes the whole experience great! Great food and great service at McGettigans..it was my husbands birthday week so we stayed for 2 days at the start and the last day before we left..definitely posh and very clean! Covid precautions taken very seriously..will definitely stay again!,5,2022,01,31
219,Very poor breakfast,"My wife and I stayed here January 20th. The hotel was fabulous as usual, the staff could not of done any more for us especially the girl in charge of the restaurant. The only thing that was very bad was the breakfast my eggs were burnt black the sausage was cut in two to see if it was cooked, plate full of oil,my wife got an old deep fried chip in her mushrooms and bacon and sausage even tho she never ordered them. We spoke to the manager but he was more interested in speaking about himself and how he used to run a 800 bedroom hotel. Nothing was done very disappointed.",4,2022,01,26
219,Club room not worth the extra money,"I have stayed in this hotel before and have had a good experience. However, this time was disappointing. I decided to spend an extra bit of money on a ‚Äúclub room‚Äù but I do not feel like I received club standard service. I would have been better off spending less money in another hotel and that is what I will be doing in future. Firstly, when I arrived I tried to order room service and was informed the bar/restaurant was closed. I.e. there was nowhere in the entire hotel that I could get food or a drink for the duration of my stay. This was not made clear to me at the point of booking nor before I arrived, if I had known this was the case I would have stayed somewhere else. The club rooms are advertised as having ‚Äú24 hour dining‚Äù, completely false advertisement. The room was nice however for the money they charge to upgrade I was expecting more. My ‚Äúview‚Äù from my bedroom window was of a wall full of graffiti. Some of the perks of a club room advertised were not available e.g. no bathrobe and slippers. I ordered room service breakfast for the next morning and was informed that there was only a continental breakfast available that morning so no hot food whatsoever. I was able to get it sent to my room but again, it was not made clear before arrival that a proper breakfast would not be available. If you‚Äôre paying for a hotel the least you expect is food and drink to be easily accessible. The rooms boast smart technology and the device that controls temperature, lights etc is very cool, but in contrast to this the tv has no way to plug in a hdmi cable which is surprising in this day and age and especially in a club room. I know of some three-star hotels in Dublin that have google chromecast on their tv‚Äôs. All in all, I don‚Äôt think I will be staying here in the future.",2,2022,01,26
219,Great hotel,"We were all very impressed with the friendly and helpful staff. The food at the hotel was also very good and the location is ideal. We would recommend the bar, food and breakfast in the morning. Late check out was also extremely helpful. ",5,2022,01,24
219,Good stop for a weekend,This was a really nice hotel and I would consider staying again. The room was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly. The bar and restaurant were also quite pleasant. Had an issue with the room being cold on the first night but the staff fixed this very promptly. ,4,2022,01,18
219,"The Address Hotel in Dublin city center ""ticks a lot of boxes""","There were very friendly hotel staff working at the front desk and in the bar area. The hotel bedroom was modern, neat and spotless. The hotel is in a good location by a LUAS stop and Connolly Train Station.",4,2022,01,18
219,Excellent Excellent Excellent,"Stayed in the Address Hotel twice before and cannot recommend it enough staff are amazing can‚Äôt do enough for you 
My boyfriend brought me to the address for two nights January 2022 for my 30th and the manager brought up Prosecco in ice bucket personally and then the remote in our room went and we got replacement batteries and unfortunately the remote still wasn‚Äôt working so after food and drinks we informed the manager again and he came and moved us up the corridor into another room and after this came and knocked on the door with two glasses of complimentary champagne for having to move rooms which was unexpected but so nice of him 
The breakfast each morning was great was so fresh and hot and great selection of everything 
Then we had one evening meal in McGettigans in the hotel and the staff ( David and Sean  in particular) were so welcoming and helpful and we had lovely food 
Would recommend this hotel to anyone, it‚Äôs in a great location and just fab",5,2022,01,11
219,Great food Impeccable service!,"We stayed on The Address Connolly for one night and were so lucky to be welcomed by such amazing staff from start to finish. David was our waiter - he was bubbly, attentive and great craic! The food was delicious especially the steak and Jacobs ladder! 
Following an incident where I misplaced my phone - the friendly security guard couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful locating my phone. 
The room was super comfortable, and well equipped. 
We have had a lovely stay and will be back!",5,2022,01,08
219,Lovely Hotel,"Recently stayed at The Address Connelly for New Years. Upon arrival the receptionist was very friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough to help. She also gave my girlfriend complementary chocolates as it was going to be her birthday on New Year‚Äôs Eve. The room it‚Äôs self was on the 3rd floor and the room was fantastic. The room was throughly cleaned before we stayed and was cleaned while we were at breakfast which was nice to see. Breakfast in the morning was excellent and we were particularly impressed by the contactless pancake maker. 
 We had dinner booked in the hotel‚Äôs restaurant for New Years Eve and it was the only fault we found with the hotel experience. The restaurant was understaffed and over priced or the night that was in it and it took ages to be served our meals and when we were finished a course it took some time for anyone of the waiting staff to come and take our plates, but in fairness they were running in and out of the kitchen all night and were clearly understaffed for the night.   
Overall the hotel is worth staying in but maybe reconsider the restaurant if it‚Äôs a busy night or if you have a budget.",4,2022,01,02
219,A great December getaway,"We recently had the pleasure of enjoying a two-night stay at ‚ÄòThe Address Connolly‚Äô mid-December.

First and foremost, the hotel and its staff were equal parts charming, and professional given the current restrictions and COVID guidelines, ensuring our stay was safe and also enjoyable.

The d√©cor of the hotel is very modern, interesting and warm, and the rooms are very comfortable. For the location which is busy we had two great nights sleep. 

Breakfast was excellent with plenty of options, and we ordered room service which had a good menu. The food we ordered was really nice, and it arrived quickly with us having to wait no time at all. 

The location is also great; only a few minutes‚Äô walk from the city centre and the docklands area. It was ideal for our Christmas getaway for enjoying what Dublin had to offer at this time of year.

Overall, highly recommended. We‚Äôll be back.",5,2021,12,26
219,Christmas week stay - fantastic!,"We had a fantastic stay in this hotel. The room was very clean and spacious and highly modern. The food, both for dinner and breakfast was delicious and the staff were very helpful and friendly! We‚Äôll be back for sure! We did the taste the address package and would absolutely recommend to it anyone, great value! ",5,2021,12,25
219,Ridiculous amount of noise,"I assume the hotel is above a nightclub. We were in room 550 and to be quite honest on the second and third night it was difficult to sleep because our room was vibrating due to external noise. Then when it wasn't that noise keeping us awake it was loud rude and drunk guests returning at all hours. Which is surprising as there was a 12pm curfew during our stay.
Oh and the tv didn't work. 
Decent location. Decent enough room. 
But the cons massively outweighed the pros which is a real shame.",2,2021,12,24
219,Great hotel and staff,"Our 3 night stay was wonderful! Most touristy spots were within walking distance from the hotel, the rooms were clean and spacious, and breakfast was delicious. The hotel manager, Cathal, went above and beyond to make our stay special! Thank you for your wonderful recommendations, we will definitely stay here again. ¬°Feliz Navidad!",5,2021,12,22
219,Christmas shopping break.,"The only complaint I have, is we didn't stay long enough!
Great place, central, modern,clean and some of the friendliest staff I have ever met. The club room was an extra bonus. Well worth a visit and we'll difinitely be back in the new year. Well done guys and thanks for a lovely stay.",4,2021,12,22

219,Fantastic,"Had a fab night there , lovely friendly staff and place extremely well managed.. rooms were spotless and the rooftop lounge was an added bonus .
David from the bar was wonderful , he made our visit worthwhile , he really is an asset to the hotel .
We‚Äôll definitely be returning for another visit soon .
Very soon ‚Ä¶",5,2021,12,20
219,The Addres  Connolly,Excellent hospitality. Would certainly recommend it. The personnel at the reception was extremely helpful and they took care of every our request. The hotel is very close to the shopping area and  within walking distance of tourist attractions.  Not difficult at all to find. ,5,2021,12,18
219,Highly Recommend,"Spent two days at The Address, Connolly.

Very warmly greeted by Isabel on reception. She and Eza are a great team.

Had gorgeous food in the restaurant. The manager, David, couldn't do enough for us. He and his co-workers were just brilliant.

There is a lovely sense of calm when you step inside the hotel.

The rooms were spotless.

Felt very safe in this Covid-ridden era.

Looking forward to returning.

219,Best hotel in Dublin City!!,"I am a huge fan of the Address Collective and have stayed in all of their properties in Ireland. The Address Connolly is by far my favourite hotel in Dublin. I recently stayed with my partner on the 'Taste of The Address' package. In my opinion this package is great value for money. The rooms are definitely 5 star standard and very modern, we ussually stay in the club room level. The rooms are very modern and have beautiful views of Connolly station. I would definitely advise getting the club level as you get exclusive access to the club lounge which has complimentary beverages. The food in McGettigans cookhouse is incredible, the waitor David is so friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you so much and we will look forward to returning soon!",5,2021,12,14
219,Shambles and scammers,"I‚Äôm really disappointed with my stay in the Address. We stayed last weekend (4-5 December) as a group of 3 couples across 3 King Size rooms.  We had been quoted via email 215‚Ç¨ per room. First when we arrived they had lost our booking and couldn‚Äôt find it for some time, then when they finally did find it they tried to charge us around 100‚Ç¨ more than what we had been quoted. Thankfully we had the email proof and eventually they did charge us the 215‚Ç¨. 

The room was nice and the stay was pleasant after that so I thought all was well. That was until on Monday I received a notification from my bank that the hotel had tried to take another 100‚Ç¨ from me. Thankfully I use a prepay card when I go to Dublin and didn‚Äôt have enough money on it so the transaction was blocked. I couldn‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd tried to take money sneakily like this without even giving a reason.
After emailing them several times this week trying to get to the bottom of this, and them taking long times to respond (while as pre arrival they were very quick on responding) they have informed me I‚Äôve been charged a smoking fee! Personally, I have never smoked and as my boyfriend is a dental professional he abhors it himself and has also never smoked. I‚Äôve emailed back the hotel to say this and asked for what evidence they have and they have not responded. 

I‚Äôm nervous they‚Äôre going to try and take money again from me and this is not something I should have to worry about from supposedly an esteemed hotel. I have also tried to call about 20-30 times this week, and they never answer. Super disappointed and definitely will not be returning.",1,2021,12,10
219,Standard room was substandard! Hotel not worth the money!,"We stayed for 2 nights during December, after booking direct with the hotel based on the misleading images on the website we were shocked to be shown to our standard room which was far below standard - a premier inn would have been better! We complained to the lady on reception and we‚Äôre given the option to upgrade for ‚Ç¨60. Given how bad the standard room was, we thought this was our only option. Walking into the ‚Äòexecutive‚Äô room on the 6th floor at 10pm we were greeted with the sound of the train rumbling past - this isn‚Äôt detailed on the website! There were no toiletries provided other than a filthy shower gel and shampoo, in what was supposedly a premium room, the room wasn‚Äôt serviced despite us asking for both of these and to be completely honest the room itself was dirty and outdated. When calling reception to flag these issues we were assured that it would be dealt with, but neither of our concerns were addressed. On check out the receptionist was less than helpful when we tried to flag our concerns again. Terrible experience, terrible hotel, would not recommend!",2,2021,12,09
219,Irish Charm,"Stayed here in November for 1 week, originally booked a premier suite but was  upgraded to the Club Suites. What an absolutely wonderful experience. For those with the extra money, please book into the club section of the hotel, as this also allows you to take advantage of the club lounge top of the hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Special mention goes to Isabel who went above and beyond to make our stay very pleasant. She's an absolute asset to the hotel. Location is pretty central Dublin 'everything' is in walking distance. Connolly Station is just across the road for travel out of the city. Breakfast is served daily, I'd advise that you pay for it when you book your stay, it's much cheaper that way. There is also a restaurant in the hotel which has good reviews although we didn't get to eat there. All in all, a brilliant experience I would recommend anyone visiting Dublin to stay here.",5,2021,12,08
219,Irish Charm,"Stayed here in the Club Suites for a week. Staff were very charming and pleasant, always willing to go out of their way to help. Special mention goes to Isabel, she's an absolute asset to hotel. The suite itself was absolutely gorgeous, I'd encourage those with a little extra money to book into the club section of the hotel and take advantage of the club lounge.

219,Brilliant service and stay,"I recently had a long weekend and stayed at The Address Connolly, I will definitely be returning.

219,Incredible hotel with the comfiest beds in Dublin!!,"Incredible hotel. The rooms were extremely spacious, with the largest/comfiest bed I have slept in for a while. The tech side of each room was very impressive - so far advanced in comparison to other hotels in Dublin! Such a great location and the food was sensational? Including the all you can eat buffet! The staff were very nice and friendly, especially the charming young gentleman at the front desk, I believe his name Cathal. 

Faultless all around",5,2021,12,06
219,Daddy's 60th celebration 10/10,"As a family we hadn't been together in over 2 years due to covid 19. We booked address connolly to surprise our dad for his 60th birthday! My sister flew in to Dublin and we checked into the hotel, the staff were amazing the service was absolutely perfect. On the first night we booked into the hotel restaurant and had our meal the staff could do not do enough. We ordered a cake from piece of cake Dublin to be delivered to the address connolly and the staff organised it to be brought out after dinner nothing was too much to ask for! The bar staff throughout our staff were fabulous especially David the manager. The rooms were spacious and we all slept great. We will most definitely be back. Thank you for making our family Christmas perfect as due to restrictions we have celebrated early this year :)",5,2021,12,06
219,Amazing stay,"We stayed for 2 nights and from the minute we got here it was amazing , the hotel is stunning , the rooms were spotless very high tech. Breakfast was fresh and such a big variety and served until 11 which is great. The staff went above and beyond for anything we asked of them. We had dinner in mcgettigans cookhouse on the second night and it was the best food we have had in a long time. I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking to stay in Dublin City the location is perfect and we will definitely be back again",5,2021,12,06
219,Nice hotel but disappointingly with room,"Great location , lovely staff , reception area v nice but room was very disappointing, we found hair in the bed and the bed covers looked like they were slept in and hadn‚Äôt been changed , there was also a lot of hair on the floor in the toilet , we complained at the time and we were moved to another room and our new room was very clean but we were disappointed, staff dealt with it well",3,2021,12,04
219,Fantastic stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Address Connolly. On arrival we were greeted by friendly and welcoming staff. The manager, Cathal, was particularly friendly, and accommodated us with all of our needs. We had a lovely meal in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed coming back to our clean and cosy rooms. Will definitely stay here again!",5,2021,12,02
219,Perfect for what we needed,Stayed here as a group of 4 mates who are old enough to know better! Centrally located and walkable to a plethora of good Dublin pubs. Staff so helpful and friendly. More than happy to store bags after check out. Rooms spacious modern and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent and on a buffet basis. Really enjoyed our stay thanks,4,2021,12,02
219,Nice hotel but the rooms are disappointing,"The hotel itself has clearly been refurbished recently and the restaurant / bar areas are very nice. However, the rooms themselves are disappointing and seem to have been overlooked in the refurb. We were supposedly in a ""Premier King"" but apart from the size of the bed it is hard to know what else was premier about it. There was no coffee machine or robes/slippers as listed on the room details. There was basic shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom, no other toiletries were provided. The air conditioning didn't work meaning the room was incredibly stuffy and we had to sleep with the window open, not ideal when you are on a main road opposite a train station. Overall, it was disappointing as we had been really looking forward to staying at the hotel based on how the rooms are presented / marketed on the website and their Instagram account, but the reality is unfortunately quite different.",3,2021,12,01
219,Smart Hotel,"Smart hotel, good position and nice rooms! The only problem is that the plugs are not European, and no hair drier. Nice athmosphere and presence of bar and restaurant! Friendly staff and easy check in ",4,2021,11,29
219,"Really brilliant, just a few tweaks!","Great location and a very beautiful hotel. Really close to transport and not too far of a walk from anywhere. The hotel restaurant was really great and again, very beautifully designed. Only two tweaks! - There were sensor lights in the bedroom which went off with the slightest movement, which made going to the toilet in the night quite unappealing, as the lights were bright enough to wake you up. The only other thing, was the water pressure in the bathroom. The shower, bath and toilet were weak and running a bath would‚Äôve taken a very long time. Thankfully, we were busy the whole weekend so these negatives weren‚Äôt enough to bug us too much! ",4,2021,11,29
219,Address Connolly Nice--Needs some attention,"Location is not ideal being away from city center; however, the staff work hard to make your stay pleasant. The room was very nice with an extremely comfy king bed. 
The coffee maker is a plus. Downside is 1. Lighting. 2. Doors. First, the lighting. Must have been a man who designed the lighting in the bathroom. Sorry, guys. Trying to have enough adequate light is impossible to put make-up on. Cannot do. Management, please put good lighting over the bathroom sink so the ladies can see to put makeup on. Second, the doors. Hotel needs to replace doors for good solid doors as very noisy when people talk walking through the corridor and the doors slam close and is very loud. Last night, was awaken several times by both issues and hotel really NEEDS good solid doors, can even hear occupants talking on the phone when walking pass, no good.
Enjoyed light late appetizers in restaurant on last night, very good. If management would fix the lighting and door issues, the location issue can be dealt with.
All in all, nice hotel if location, lighting and doors were not an issue. Staff among some of the best I have encountered in my travels. Hope management steps up on issues I mentioned.",4,2021,11,28
219,Reasonable Stay for A Couple Nights,"We found the room and location was good value for money overall.

The area in which the hotel is located is not a prime hot spot for bars / restaurants but within walkable distance to the main centre and taxi to hotel from Dublin airport s around 20 euro. 

A little bit disappointed we didn't have the room checked after staying 3 nights. Could have benefited from clean towels / toiletries etc. However, reception did sort it as soon as mentioned. 

If i was being super picky, there are sensory lights under the bed which made it frustrating in the night - if you moved your legs too quickly they'd go off in the middle of the night.",3,2021,11,24
219,Lovely hotel staff all friendly just a little bit of upskilling needed in places,"We had great service the fruit bowl was not at all as advertised to the picture no grapes or exotic fruit included, the bar service was table service we had out first round of drinks delivered after a while then no one came back to us to serve us again, we decided to give up and leave and were then told we could ha e gone to the bar ourselves which we didn‚Äôt know and would have preferred ",4,2021,11,22
219,"Good, just not great. ","On arrival the hotel is immaculate. The decor and lighting is stunning and really wows. Check in was granted to us early and went very smoothly.

We paid for an upgrade and even then the room was just OK. Not immaculately clean and missing a few special touches.. E.g. There are tea bags but no kettle, no slippers/robe as advertised, etc. As per many other comments the rooms are very hot, even with the window open (it only opens slightly) and/or the AC on we were often very hot. The shower pipes made a weird noise if we had it on full blast so we never did that, and the toilet often didn't flush properly first time around. Nonetheless, it all worked. The bed was large and comfortable, the was an iron and board, fridge, good TV, towels (although quite crisp and scratchy). Most disappointing was there is no turn down service - which we weren't told about, we just found out naturally. Spending 5 days in one place with no one to take the bins, provide new towels, toilet roll, provide new coffee capsules or mugs, really really detracts from your experience. Even in my own home I wouldn't go 5 days without giving a room a wipe down!

We didn't eat breakfast here as many reviews said it was over priced for what it was. But we enjoyed many cocktails in the beautiful bar, Sean is a treasure and was truly wonderful. The cocktails are great and we came back here after dinner elsewhere multiple times because of how good they were.

Staff on the whole were very nice. Some weren't particularly on the ball.. On occasion we had to ask for things several times, but they were always happy to help.

Another issue which isn't really the hotels fault is the area. I wouldn't have known this beforehand but Connolly is really quite a dodgy area. It is a short walk to the more touristy hot spots which are more up market but unfortunately as a woman, if I didn't have my boyfriend with me, I wouldn't feel safe outside the hotel. We witnessed a fist fight round the corner at 10am in the morning, lots of people who seem drunk or out of it, or shouting and arguing. It's a very run down area of Dublin, which is a shame as the hotel inside is very glamorous.

I would say we've enjoyed our stay here. Nothing has gone disastrously wrong and it's provided somewhere to sleep in comfort and most of what we needed. But I probably wouldn't come back. Except for a cocktail :) ",3,2021,11,21
219,"Good hotel, very poor service","I came here on the 20th with my boyfriend and his friends for a show in Dublin. The hotel itself is very attractive with very good amenities. The rooms are chic and modern, with a very impressive digital system to control the lights and curtains. However, we attended the bar downstairs and were very disappointed with the service. First of all the staff seemed clueless and didn‚Äôt appear to know what they were doing. The menu explained if any drinks weren‚Äôt to your liking they would make one of your choice. They refused to do this. We brought it up and we‚Äôre told they‚Äôre only sticking to the drinks in the menu. Secondly, we ordered drinks at 10.45 and didn‚Äôt receive them to 23.35. One of our friends went to the bar to enquire and we‚Äôre extremely rude. They ignored him for a considerable amount of time before any one came near him. His response to why we hadn‚Äôt received the drinks was ‚Äúit‚Äôs just fell through the cracks‚Äù but the drinks were sitting at the bar and one of the other staff members pointed them out. One staff member Tegan was very polite and made the experience far better. She was the only one with a bit of banter and manners. Overall the experience wasn‚Äôt the worst but the service in the bar could be improved.",2,2021,11,20
219,Weekend stay,"We have recently returned from a lovely weekend in Dublin. The hotel is beautiful, very modern and clean. Check in was quick and straight forward and our room was spacious with a nice big comfy bed and walk in shower. (We upgraded to one of the more modern rooms)

 The bar area and restaurant had a nice buzz about it and the staff were very friendly.  We had breakfast in the cellar room one morning and that was also very good with lots of selections; cooked breakfast, pastries, fruit and a choice of different cereals were on offer. We didn‚Äôt get offered any tea or coffee though, which was a shame. 

One thing that does need attention is the air conditioning and light sensors in the rooms. With it being November I know that air conditioning isn‚Äôt on everyone‚Äôs checklist but we like a cool room and the air con just didn‚Äôt do anything. Also, the light sensors that I assume are there for when you need to get up in the night are too sensitive/faulty. The lights kept turning on throughout the night and I am a light sleeper so this was very annoying. 

Overall the hotel is great for the price and the location was handy. We would probably return if the above notes were addressed. 

Thanks",4,2021,11,16
219,the hotel is not a 4 star hotel,"the room was too hot because the airco was broken, the room was not cleaned because of covid. they could have warned us by checking in instead of putting it on a piece of paper in your room. the coffee for breakfast was awfull, please put a proper machine for the guest or if they ask for a special coffee go to get it instead of telling people to go upstairs to the bar. ",3,2021,11,15
219,Hen night in Dublin,"My daughter didn‚Äôt want any fuss for her hen night, so she and I travelled to Dublin for one night. An Irish cousin met us there. We stayed at the Address Connolly. Lovely place with wonderful food. Possibly the best steak I‚Äôve ever tasted, my daughter and cousin agreed. However, also the slowest service, it took 1 1/2 hours to get our main meal, and in over the 2+ hours we spent in the restaurant only served 3 drinks, the last arriving as we were getting ready to leave. Staff were very pleasant but very little communication amongst them.
Also paid on arrival for late checkout, which was not logged onto a system and staff insisted I hadn‚Äôt paid. Had to return to my room and dig my receipt out of the bin to prove I‚Äôd payed. 
Overall lovely place but could have been better.",4,2021,11,15
219,Some Room For Improvement,"The hotel is nicely refurbed, although it does show some signs of it's age, as the floorboards on the 6th floor hallway where I stayed were very creaky. The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated, a nice bathroom and shower. The staff were polite and efficient. My main gripe is that quality of the breakfast was poor. Industrially sourced meat that was utterly tasteless, and the hot plate was too hot (the beans were boiling in their container) so the food ended up dried out anyway. The one good thing I could say is that they had the coffee/tea at the table immediately, which in my experience of Irish hotels is unusual. I really think poor breakfasts damage the tourist experience to Ireland, and given the price was between ‚Ç¨14 & ‚Ç¨17, I really think the hotel could improve the experience by investing in some quality meats and still make a profit. Indeed, I could buy a better breakfast myself in a supermarket and feed 2-3 people for less, so room for improvement if they want to. I find the quality of breakfasts mark out the really quality hotels, so if this is what they aspire to, this is something they really need to address.",3,2021,11,14
219,Amazing experience,"Me and my partner spent one night in this beautiful hotel. The staff was very nice and welcoming. We also received a room upgrade for free. Everything was very clean, tidy and comfortable. Also, we really appreciated the delicious food in the restaurant and the staff there were just great! We highly recommend this place to anyone and we hope to have the chance to spend some time there again.",5,2021,11,11
219,Nice Hotel but restaurant menu could be improved,"As mentioned I think the hotel is lovely and it is very central. I am not 100% sure I would select it as my first choice. I am a vegan and I think in 2021 most places would have something on offer, particularly given that it is in the capital city where there are so many foreigners. It would be great if they reviewed this.",3,2021,11,11
219,Awful,"I rang the hotel every 10 minutes for 2 hours and nobody answered whichever extension number I  used. I then got to reception and told the lady who was completely disinterested and offered me no explanation. She then gave me a form to fill out and virtually threw it at me and then walked off without giving me a pain, I asked to speak to the manager and she said she would get him 10 minutes later no sign of him and she rudely told us he was busy and would come to our room later. The manager Colin was a nice guy and apologised on her behalf but the lady in question was the worst front of house I have ever seen in 30 years ",1,2021,11,08
219,Okay but not great!,"From the outside the hotel looks a little run down, however once you step inside the interior is stylish and welcoming and smells amazing. Staff were friendly and very helpful. McGettigans restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere but food was average. Although the Club twin room is stylish and comfortable it faced straight on to the railway line (Room 535) and the noise of the passing trains spoiled our sleep for our early morning flight. ",3,2021,11,08
219,Great loication - poorly maintained,"A great trip spoiled by poor sleep due to a noisy heating/cooing unit. I was advised by staff that this was only at start up and that it would quieten down, sadly this was not the case.
TV volume was faulty - fixed temporarily but reverted back after switch off. Not hwat I expect in this supposed calibre of room.",3,2021,11,04
219,"Great staff, lovely rooms, felt covid safe","Went for a three day conference and the hotel was very well located.  The staff were professional, helpful, very competent and a credit to the hotel.   My room (club) was outstanding, very clean and the access to the seventh floor area was a brilliant addition.  The conference room was a little noisy, not helped by the Dublin weather but that is a very minor thing.  The breakfast was also nice along with the restaurant.  All in all a great place to stay.",5,2021,10,31
219,Nice location in Dublin,"The Address Connolly was our destination for 2 nights in Dublin. It is well located to visit the very impressive Epic Emigration Museum, and Trinity College. The staff is very attentive and helpful. 
Our room was perfect for our short stay. Service was excellent. We could open the window safely for fresh air.
The parking garage is a bit distant, but they did accept our hotel voucher for a discount. 
",5,2021,10,27
219,Gorgeous hotel,"Gorgeous hotel however reception staff were less attentive than other hotels. On arrival they changed our restaurant booking from 7.30pm to 6.30pm (giving us no choice in the matter) meaning we had to rush to get ready after being at a local spa. When we arrived at the restaurant at 6.30 our booking was 7.30 after all meaning we rushed for no reason. Restaurant staff were unbelievable and very attentive, the food and cocktails were top class. 
During our trip we received an email advising us to book a reservation for breakfast, when we went to reception to reserve a time we were asked for 58euro to pay for breakfast which was already paid for. The issue with the reception staff was a shame as the vibe and location of the hotel was amazing.",3,2021,10,24
219,Great hotel with service above average,The staff are bery receptive and they treat you as they would like to be treated. Located near Connolly Station so great for Dart day trips. Breakfast here is a feast of your choice and dinner is also excellent. ,5,2021,10,23
219,October stay,"Lovely building and interior, slightly noisy with being above a train track but found it not to be disturbing. Only downfall was when checked in we were booked into someone else‚Äôs room but got upgraded to premium for free which made up for it‚Ä¶ sorry to him! ",4,2021,10,19
219,Pascale B,"I already stayed at The adress a few times. Location is perfect and before they used to serve some wine at 6 pm on the roof top. A little disappointing this time compared to previous stays, but efforts from the manager of the hotel have convinced me to make a new try soon...May be linked with the COVID.",2,2021,10,18
219,Weekend in Dublin,"The Address Connolly is the perfect spot for a weekend in Dublin. Just across from Connolly station and only a 15 minute walk to Henry Street. Lovely staff, great service, super location, cool decor, and very clean.",5,2021,10,17
219,"Great staff & light, modern rooms.","We really enjoyed our stay at the Connolly. The staff are all fantastic , especially Johnny in the bar! Rooms were smart with everything you need. They are not currently servicing rooms (unless requested), which I thought would be OK by requesting fresh towels & toilet rolls (they use really thin ones that means you have to use a lot more!) daily, but by day 3 the room was in need of a proper clean, so if you're staying for more than one night, I'd recommend requesting servicing. 
Breakfast is buffet style, with hot & cold options - I would say there's something for everyone. The bacon is particularly good. 
We ate in the restaurant one evening and the food exceeded our expectations, it was absolutely stunning - we all loved it!
The hotel is directly opposite a train station and I would recommend getting a train from there to spend a few hours in Howth. Its a pretty seaside town with a good selection of bars/restaurants and a bit of peace away from the city. We also took advantage of the lovely weather and did a little boat trip around Ireland's Eye.",5,2021,10,13
219,Family & friends stay,"David was amazing he gave us a great laugh for our whole stay and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us, he really made our trip extra special. Keith was also great, as was Andja at reception who really looked after us. The food was great and drinks were amazing too, would highly recommend this hotel, great location, great staff, great value. We will definitely be back. Looking forward to our next stay already",5,2021,10,10
219,great stay,"Lovely hotel great service, good breakfast, staff helpful and lovely gym. In a good location. Only negatives were room looked out on a service area and couldn‚Äôt get room cool enough . Would recommend for a stay in Dublin",4,2021,10,07
219,Great stay,"Amazing stay, decor of the hotel was stunning. Rooms were lovely and very clean. Less than 5 min walk from train station. Breakfast had a good selection. Staff were friendly. We would definitely stay again! ",5,2021,10,04
219,We'll be back!,"I loved everything about my stay at the address connolly. The room was spotless and very comfortable.  Dining.. omg dinner in mcgettigans cookhouse was delicious, seasoned perfectly and the staff friendly and attentive - a big shout out to David for looking after us so well ! Did I mention the food? Soooo good üòÉ",5,2021,10,03
219,An unusual hotel this,"For a building with a railway track through the middle, it‚Äôs a stylish hotel this and I like it a lot. Rooms are well provided, well serviced, comfortable beds and there is no noise from the railway track. You are not going to get a view from a lot of the rooms and ours looked out on large extract ducts. Friendly, helpful staff. It is not far from the main shopping streets but it‚Äôs a fair old hike to the popular Fleet Street.",4,2021,10,02
219,Superb location,"Location was fantastic (close to everything, walking distance) and restaurant‚Äôs staff were polite and accommodating. Cleanliness and wifi needs improvement. Slow wifi at most times in the second floor. Overall, an average stay. ",3,2021,09,30
219,BEDROOM LIKE A SAUNA,"I stayed here for a night with 2 friends. The room was warm so we ask management to check the air con as didnt seem to work and went out for dinner. Came back to a bedroom like a SAUNA. Called management who said he felt the temp was fine however it was 24 degrees. He said he could move us to a different room but it would ve the same temp. It was a very uncomfortable sleep, spoke with management again the next morning and ask for the manager to call me back. Still awaiting a call. Extremely poor customer service.",1,2021,09,29
219,Great Holiday,"Staff friendly, polite and helpful, hotel and food were all great. Would happily stay there again. Conveniently situated across from Connelly Station, walking distance to O'Connell Street. Short distance by taxi from the Port.",5,2021,09,22
219,Beware of car parking issues if driving,"Unfortunately our stay here was very much an, ""oh, what could have been"" moment. A really lovely hotel, but regrettably, had big issues with car parking and bad advice from hotel staff regarding parking. Firstly, there's no information regarding car parking on the website, so we had to call in advance of our arrival to try to find out the best place to park. That in itself was not an issue (but the website could be a lot more helpful in that regard). Secondly though, on calling, we were advised to park in the Irish Life Centre car park, which is located close to the hotel. We arrived in Dublin at about midday and parked the car at the Irish Life Centre as advised. We had a prior appointment in Dublin, so thought that the easiest thing to do, would be to park up and head off into town and check in to the hotel later (leaving the luggage etc in the car to collect later on that evening when we came to check in). Unfortunately, what we were not told on the phone earlier that day (and not mentioned on the hotel's website) was that the Irish Life Centre car park closes at 10pm on Saturday and does not open until 10am the next day. Wanting to make the most of our time in Dublin, we stayed out all day and only returned to the hotel later that evening (after 10pm) to check in. We arrived at the Irish Life Centre car park to find it locked up and shuttered closed. This meant that we were not able to retrieve any of our luggage from the car to take up to the hotel room (clothes, chargers, tooth brushes and washing facilities etc) - so we had to check in without any of our belongings, which was really disappointing. To be fair to the hotel staff, they were very apologetic and handled the situation very well, offering us a free room upgrade. Whilst this was appreciated, we were not able to properly enjoy the stay. Without any of our luggage, we were not able to wash properly (e.g. brush teeth, take out contact lenses), not able to charge phones (so woke up on the Sunday with flat batteries) and with no change of clothes on Sunday morning. To make matters worse, on Sunday morning we needed the car early (to leave and get to the airport). When returning to the car park at 9am on Sunday morning, the Irish Life Centre car park was still locked and shuttered, so we were still not able to get in. We were not the only tourists affected by this issue, as it appears other hotels are also encouraging guests to use this car park.  On arriving at the car park, we met another couple having the same issue (from a different hotel). Luckily, their hotel manager was proactively dealing with the situation and had managed to contact security to open the car park. We were only able to get to our car because luckily by chance, we arrived at the car park at the same time as this other couple. Again, it has to be said that The Address staff did handle the situation as best as they could (and kindly offered a room upgrade), but the hotel really needs to put more information on their website and be aware of the opening and closing times of the car park before encouraging guests to park there. It's pretty basic information and the situation could easily have been avoided. The hotel itself is lovely and the room we stayed in was very nice. We also stayed at The Address in Cork the week before, which was also fabulous. ",2,2021,09,20
219,Above expectations,Staff were so pleasant and helpful could not have asked for better service. Food was really good quality and served promptly with a smile.Rooms were clean and COVID measures in place. A lovely hotel highly recommended.,5,2021,09,14
219,Good city break,"We recently stayed in The Address in one of the Club rooms. We enjoyed the room, very clean, lovely decorated, great shower. Minus for lack of bathrobes which suppouse to be provided. Club lounge beautifull but again we havent got any evening refreshments as promised so overall not enough for price of the room. Dinner was delicious and waiter that served us couldnt do enough. Same as bar staf, and 10/10 for cockails. Breakfast room is stunning but breakast itself was poor quality. Smokey bacon is deff no for breakfast. Pleasent stay",4,2021,09,13

Fabulous food , ate in Mc gettigans for lunch and evening dinner, place very busy as it was All Ireland weekend but the quality of the was was exceptional.

Will definitely visit again üòÉ

219,Bad Check in experience and uncleaned room,It took 20 minutes to check in eventhough there was nobody else checking in at the same time. Two people working on reception.  My lady kept leaving me to answer the phone.  Very annoying.  No guidance on breakfast times or food available eventhough I asked.  We stayed two nights and our room was not cleaned or clean towels replaced or tea/coffee replenished.  We came back in at 10pm on saturday night after being away all day to an untidy room with no clean towels and unable to make tea or coffee as there was none.  Tried ringing reception 4 times and nobody would answer me.  Very very disappointed.,2,2021,09,13
219,Lovely stay,"We stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed our visit.  Staff very friendly , in particular Keith was very helpful with a minor issue . It's in a great location beside , trains, bus, Luas, taxis etc .We would stay here again.",5,2021,09,11
219,Great hotel with good service,"I stayed at the Hotel Connolly for 3 nights and wasn't disappointed when I arrived, we arrived early due to our flight landing at 9 am and we were welcomed by friendly staff and shown to our room immediately which was a nice surprise. Very spacious rooms, great breakfast and overall we felt very safe with good levels of cleanliness and masks being worn by all staff and customers in public areas. We did have a small issue during our stay which was resolved quickly and efficiently when brought to the manager's attention, a great response that demonstrated a good level of customer care and attention. I would have no hesitation in staying here again.",4,2021,09,09
219,COVID is not an excuse for bad hospitality,"We checked in earlier today. The room and lobby is lovely and clean, decor is nice and these are the only good sides of this hotel. 

Staff was very disappointing, the two girls at the reception need more training on what their job entails. One gave the wrong eir code for the car park, even after asking if the letter was a V or a Z. When I asked one of her for the recommendation for nice dinner she had no a clue about what was around.

Also the rates on third party sites like booking.com & hotels.com were cheaper then the rates quoted over the phone. These sites take commissions so why are you quoting more expensive rates then OTAs?

The menus in the hotel are ‚Äúreduced‚Äù, so we went somewhere else to eat and breakfast is not included in our rate tonight so we are happy to go somewhere else in the morning too.

We came back to the hotel and were told the residents bar was closed (it was 11:30pm), even though we saw people having drinks and the in down the road were still open. There was also no water in room and tap water tastes really bad.

Once again we didn‚Äôt feel welcomed or looked after. If afraid COVID is not an excuse for bad hospitality.

Please train your staff in hospitality, maybe send them to another hotel to learn and see first hand, I can name a few dozen they could learn a lot from. 

This hotel is not accessible if you‚Äôre driving.

Very, very disappointing stay, we will be leaving tomorrow unhappy.",2,2021,09,06
219,Dw,Overall a very enjoyable trip and excellent hotel with a brilliant location. Excellent bar service with barman making us an off the menu mocktail. Very friendly staff and excellent breakfast (although the blender wasn't working so unable to have a smoothie which is all Karl wanted). Only thing on the downside during our trip was the party in the apt block next door till after 4am which prevented a good quality sleep üò¥ ,5,2021,09,05

219,Nice hotel but many let downs,"Recently purchased a special offer deal for this hotel. This deal included dinner in the price however we were not informed until we arrived that their restaurant was closed due to a chef catching covid (understandable if we had of been alarmed). This made it difficult to get a booking else where and the hotel offered no other food options. We were also suppose to receive complimentary cocktails on arrival however we were asked to pay for these

Within the room there is sensor lights beside the bed. One of the bedside lights clearly had a malfunction and was strobing on all night. The shower also had zero power and you would be better washing your hair in the sink!

When checking in, the reception staff walked off mid conversation leaving us with no key to get into our room until she was informed by another member the interaction was not complete. 

On the contrary the bar staff were lovely and extremely friendly. The breakfast provided had a large variety and the hotel was clean. ",3,2021,09,02
219,Unsatisfactory stay,"Reception staff were very incompetent- mid check in, the staff member walked off to deal with a colleague - meaning we were waiting to check in our second room. Another reception staff member kindly took over. No information was given regarding breakfast at check in. No information was given regarding the closure of the kitchen due to Covid, which in these current circumstances can‚Äôt be helped but information would have been helpful. Regardless of this considering our package included a dinner - we should have been informed. A number of days previous I had tried to book dinner following which I received an email response stating no availability. This which i then discovered was incorrect and the kitchen was closed. As I said already this we know can‚Äôt be helped and was totally acceptable but we should have been informed. The packaged included Lilly O‚ÄôBrien chocolates in the room - there was none in either room! I had added a note on the booking that it was a special birthday celebration - to which nothing was done, all we would have liked was an acknowledgment of the celebration in the room with even a note. Our package also included complementary cocktails - which at the time of paying our bar bill we had to remind staff of in order to ensure we weren‚Äôt charged. They were totally unaware. Also room 152 the hot water shower was APPALLING!!! There was no water when on hot. Raindrops would have given more water. Also our flush on the toliet wasn‚Äôt working correctly.  ",2,2021,09,02
219,one night stay,specified that we were on a wedding anniversary they said they gave us an upgrade but if this was an upgrade im glad we didnt get the other room.eventually after mentioning it again at 10 o clock we were offered 2 cocktails,4,2021,09,01
219,Short stay in Dublin,Its a nice family New renovated hotel in Dublin. The restaurant and the reception area are really nicely done. The rooms are okay can a bit noisy so you can't sleep with your windows open. The connolly station is just opposite of the hotel which is brilliant.  ,4,2021,09,01
219,Fun weekend break,"Central Hotel, walking distance to shops, gd pubs. Nice decor in foyer, restaurant etc. Breakfast & dinner were excellent. Friendly staff. Rooms are fine, clean,TV, hairdryer, small fridge - everything u needed. Gd shower, bathroom on the small side but didn't matter!  Area was fine too - just go about Yr business & no-one bothers you. Would def stay again ",5,2021,08,31

219,Felt more like a 3-star hotel,"We stayed 3 nights, and on none of the days our room was serviced. We complained two times, but eventually on the last night we were told staff was low in number. However would have been nice if we were notified about this during checkin. Also, rooms are very noisy. First there are the trains riding next to our window, then on the second night the hotel thought it was a good idea to drill next to our room at 7:30, and on the third night we were awakened in the middle of the night by loud party people residing in the same corridor. Overall rooms could have been cleaner, shower pressure was bad, only few care products. I cannot believe that this was a 4-star hotel, felt more like a 3-star hotel or even less.",2,2021,08,29
219,Shopping,"Took my daughter for shopping in Dublin before going back to school,we loved our stay the hotel was Covid friendly, all spotless and clean,staff were Brilliant, we had a brilliant sleep, The breakfast was buffet,it was delicious and local produce ",5,2021,08,27
219,Disappointed,"I‚Äôm disappointed with this hotel given the reviews on Tripadvisor.  

The positives - 

Strong air conditioning and an ok bed. 

Convenient location.  

The negatives - 

The rooms have signs of wear. There are cracks in the bathrooms. 

There are palm prints on the mirrors. 

The tv has the hdmi disabled, it‚Äôs 2021 and you can‚Äôt even plug your device in. 

The bath/shower hardly drains. The bathroom vent is filthy. 

The safe doesn‚Äôt work. 

My room had a king bed with three pillows. It took hours to receive a fourth pillow. Calling reception results in long waits for resolution.

All in all, it‚Äôs a rather disappointing experience.",2,2021,08,25
219,Beautiful hotel with lacking service,"Pre stay the communication was poor via email, I sent numerous emails and got ignored resulting in me having to call and the majority of staff bar one receptionist was unhelpful, especially the reservation manager.

I booked the ‚ÄòTaste the address package‚Äô Bed and breakfast, 3 course evening meal, a complimentary signature cocktail and chocolates in the room. We never received any of the chocolates (not a big deal) however I did receive a call to advise that the restaurant had to be closed due to Covid and wouldn‚Äôt be open for any night of our stay. I spoke to reception on return to gave a ‚Ç¨46 refund and told us we were free to order ‚Äòtakeaway‚Äô the alternative offered was a takeaway! ‚Ç¨46 euro refund for what should have been a 3 course meal for 2 was insulting.

I had also ordered a bottle of wine and cheeseboard to be added to our room on arrivals as a surprise, This was forgotten about and wasn‚Äôt  placed into the room, I had to make my way to reception to ask for it. 

The breakfast was great plenty of choice however service from staff again was lacking. 

Cocktails in the bar were beautiful! 

We stayed in the club room, Beautiful spacious clean rooms and of course the smart technology was a fantastic touch‚Ä¶. Really impressed. If you booked a club room or suite you get exclusive access the club lounge with free refreshments and the rooftop balcony which was lovely and relaxing. You also have access to a private lift only for guest staying in the club wing.

A beautiful hotel that I will recommend and would return however the service and customer service from staff at the reception desk and breakfast need big improvements.",4,2021,08,25
219,Lack of communication ,"Had booked  2 nights back in Feb 2020 pre- covid when hotel was known as The North Star.
Our booking was kindly kept despite being non refundable. On arrival I added another night making use of the excellent deal of  bed breakfast and evening meal plus chocolates in the room for ‚Ç¨149 which we paid for there and then by cash. 
The room was clean , bed very comfortable but had to call reception to get maintenance to change the battery in the safe. WiFi worked well but the tablet in the room wasn't connected and I gave up after a couple of tries. Breakfast was excellent as was dinner. Unfortunately our 3rd night the restaurant was closed due to covid.   No alternatives were offered.On check out we explained we weren't able to use our vouchers for dinner and was offered a refund. Due to a lack of communication between reception staff we were charged for the extra evening again A few phone calls resolved the issue but I found this embarrassing and un professional. Oh we never got the chocolates either and our key cards ceased to work after 2 days. ",3,2021,08,24
219,Didn't like my stay,"I wasn't particularly impressed with anything. The position was next to a street full of drunkards, room was close to the station so much we could hear and feel trains every  5-10 minutes. We found a dirty shirt on the room chair, and had to ask TWICE to have it removed. When they did so, they didn't even bother sanitizing the chair. I wonder how they clean the rooms. Restaurant has last order at 9pm, we arrived a bit late for our tour and ordered at 8.57pm, the chef was visibly irritated and kept looking at me sideways. Food was good. Breakfast was average. 
All in all, I would not and will not come back.",2,2021,08,21
219,Beautiful Hotel,"Hotel was lovely, clean , staff excellent, club lounge super , bedrooms, Restaurant/ Bar excellent, coffee/ iron in rooms , free as it is in the club lounge with panoramic views! Down where it‚Äôs situated",5,2021,08,17
219,Outstanding Throughout!,"The staff, whether they work on reception, the restaurant/bar, maintenance or management make this outstanding hotel what it is!

I've already had the pleasure of staying here 7 days with a few more to go. As I've already stated the staff are what this place is all about. They are all courteous, polite and friendly without that falseness. No request is a problem and the responsiveness to it is outstanding. Superb customer service throughout.

The Bar / Restaurant is a great place to relax and have a quiet drink. The Food,  whether its served in Mcgettigan's or breakfast in the Cellar, is second to none!

Rooms are of a great standard, clean, have all you need and have the added bonus of a big comfy bed.

......... even  location is great for everything!",5,2021,08,17
219,Lovely room,"I booked a triple room last minute, for me and the kids, and we all loved it. We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel, both of which were great, and best of all we were only a block away from Kellie Harrington's home as she won Olympic gold for Ireland so we got to enjoy those celebrations tangentially. Well done, Kellie!",5,2021,08,17
219,Poor dinner service,"Lovely location, clean rooms. Experience of dining terrible. Waited over one and a half hours for dinner with little update from staff every time chased up. Just kept saying it‚Äôs on its way or was totally ignored. Nothing offered to compensate. ",3,2021,08,17
219,Great spot in every way,We had a lovely overnight stay here. Food was excellent. Club rooms are really nice with dedicated lift and key card access. Earlier check in time than most hotels a real plus. The Luas is just across the road from front door and car parking a 5-10 minute walk. Would highly recommend this hotel.,4,2021,08,16
219,Great hotel,"Stayed here for one night and wished we were staying longer! The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful, the hotel is beautiful and the rooms had everything you could need all in all a great hotel and we will deff be back. The location was perfect close to the train station and the centre.",5,2021,08,16
219,Lovely Stay,Stayed at the hotel for 1 night with friends. We done the dine and overnight package. Hotel was lovely and spotless clean. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was very nice too. Would definitely recommend.,5,2021,08,16
219,Fantastic Saturday Night Stay,"The Address Connolly (formerly The North Star Hotel) is located directly across the road from Connelly Station. You literally leave the station and walk into the hotel in two minutes. If you're struggling to find it, its got a white exterior, though the signage is pretty obvious.
First things first the hotel is gorgeous. The main lobby/reception area is incredibly well finished, with loads of cool art and statues dotted around it. Check in was a breeze and our receptionist was very friendly and professional. We got our room, 558 on the fifth floor, and headed up. The room was again very pretty and finished nicely, with a great bath and shower combo that my partner readily availed herself of. The bed also was insanely comfortable. We didn't even remember falling asleep.
Irelands current covid regulations require you to have both vaccinations in order to eat and drink indoors and I have only had my first one so far so we couldn't go anywhere for dinner. However the loophole to this is you are allowed to have drinks and dinner in the hotel you're staying in so we booked in to McGettigans Cookhouse in the hotel. Again I'd recommend booking in advance, I called earlier in the week to book in. The meal was fantastic and not actually too pricey for Dublin. We even had dessert! The staff were great craic, friendly and handled the busy restaurant really well. I'd dine in there again even without the restrictions being in place.
We added breakfast the night before to our booking and enjoyed the amazing spread they put on the next morning. The coffee was pretty good too! After check out the staff held on to our bags and we went to enjoy our afternoon in the city.",5,2021,08,15
219,Paid ‚Ç¨378 for 2 nights without bed and breakfast included which was a shame as it would want to be included in that pric,Paid ‚Ç¨378 for 2 nights without bed and breakfast included which was a shame as it would want to be included in that price! Requested a deluxe king room with a balcony over looking the queys but inside facing dirty apartments with no areas to sit! The bedroom was just too single beds pushed together it was such a shame,1,2021,08,14
219,Staff is lovely and welcoming!,"We enjoyed our time here! The staff made a great impression on us as they were warm and welcoming. Our original hotel was under construction and the folks at The Address accommodate us and we even were treated to a cappuccino as they worked out the details of our stay. We observed that the staff came in to the restaurant during dinner to support a very lean post COVID kitchen staffing situation. It was very impressive to see assistant managers roll up their sleeves and work in a hot kitchen. That said, dinner was a bit disappointing however staff addressed this. Giving grace to the kitchen staff as they are clearly overwhelmed with the sudden influx of clients. ",5,2021,08,10
219,Stunning Room,"I stayed here with my friend and we both agree that the room was absolutely gorgeous. Upon checking in we were given a voucher which came with our package and a money off voucher for our next stay. I will say a bit more information could‚Äôve been given upon check in in relation to how the hotel works, bar opening and closing times etc. 
We had booked a club room which is so modern and bright. There was even a button beside the bed that opens and closes the curtains for you. There was a waterfall shower in the room that was absolutely beautiful. When you book a club room you get access to the club lounge which is a lovely place to have a coffee with a little bit of privacy outside of your room. On a nice day there is a little outdoor terrace/ smoking area where you can enjoy drinks from the bar. 
We had dinner in the Mcgettigans cookhouse during our stay, which was a nice experience. The staff seemed under pressure as there was 1 manager, 1 barman, 1 chef and 1 waitress. It did take about 20 minutes for our food and drinks order to be taken but this was during peak time.  We felt the staff could‚Äôve been a little more observant but I do believe it was quite busy and as I said there was only 1 waitress. The food over all was nice, fairly average but as far as hotel restaurants go it was nice. We did make a few requests as fussy eaters ie extra sauces/no salads etc however our requests were not met which although was a little disappointing, was not the end of the world. 
Breakfast the next morning was an experience, I will say the options are fairly limited as the only hot food available is a full irish buffet then there is a selection of continental options. 
The reason the hotel is losing a star in this review is based on covid safety. The buffet was delicious and I would definitely go again, however the staff were not sanitising the breakfast utensils between uses and people were not wearing masks going up and back to the buffet. This is easily rectified and by all means did not impact my stay negatively. 
Thank you and we look forward to seeing you again! Special thanks to John at reception and the bar for all of his help during our stay :)",4,2021,08,09
219,Address,"Good hotel in decent location, but bad concierge, asked for a Wake up call and recieved it 20 minutes late. Also waiting to check in along with others and was so distracted by the phone that they didnt notice all of us. Real training needed to bring this place up.",3,2021,08,09
219,Relaxing stay,"Absolutely love this hotel. The location is only a 10 minute walk from the city City. Decor is fab. Staff are all very  professional.
Great value for money, looking forward to staying again soon.
Couldn't fault this hotel in anyway x",5,2021,08,08
219,Perfect!,"Had an overnight stay here on Thursday, I can't find any fault whatsoever, From check in to check out every staff member we met were so welcoming and helpful, they couldn't do enough for us, dinner in mcgettigans and breakfast next morning was excellent! Rooms and public areas were spotless clean. This hotel offers great service and value for money, I would recommend it highly!",5,2021,08,07
219,Very clean and comfortable ,"The stay was excellent. The rooms were super clean and the service incredible. There were only two buts, which are the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5. The wifi did not reach my room properly and the toilet took a few attempts to flush. Other than that, excellent. ",4,2021,08,07
219,Great overnight stay,"Stayed here with friends overnight, room was fab, lovely rooftop bar and the food was amazing. Can‚Äôt thank the friendly staff enough for making our stay so enjoyable from Angie at reception to Keith and Colin in the bar nothing was a problem. Would highly recommend.",4,2021,08,05
219,Great stay!,Lovely hotel with very friendly staff. Room was nice and modern and restaurant was good and service was friendly. Hotel is in a great location beside the train station but i would take caution walking around the area at night as it's not the best area in Dublin. Better off getting a taxi in the evening time.,5,2021,08,03
219,Great stay,"The staff were friendly, the hotel was very clean, the bed is extremely comfortable, overall a great stay. The Club room had a coffee maker and the control system was very modern. I would recommend staying here.",5,2021,08,03
219,Great location and service,"Very friendly personnel, clean room, great location - all I needed was great here&now. Did not eat breakfast this time, but tried the restaurant and was satisfied. Kept very clean without stupidities like clean your own room, it is coronavirus-time.",4,2021,08,02
219,Amazing stay,I have to say that this was one of the nicest experiences we have had in a long long time ‚òòÔ∏èThe food the staff especially David the waiter he went above and beyond for me and my husband highly recüíö‚òòÔ∏è,5,2021,08,01
219,Great stay at The Address Connolly,"I stayed at The Address for 10 nights en route from Abu Dhabi to the UK. I chose this hotel because of the TripAdvisor reviews, the location and the gym (which I did not use but thought I would).
I initially started my stay in a standard room which was fine for me and the added bonus was the A/C - as it was a heatwave when I checked in I was very happy. The A/C unit was leaking so I was relocated to a Club Room on the 4th floor and it was fantastic! Room size, personalized Room wifi; coffee maker; larger bathroom and automatic controls for curtains/lights etc were the main differences. As I was working throughout my stay I was really grateful for the wifi and the desk.
The staff were more than helpful and happy to assist with any request. The location of the hotel was great for me as I visited a few museums on the dock and found it easy to walk to Grafton St; O‚ÄôConnell St in 15 -20 mins. If you don‚Äôt like walking choose a hotel more central. 
The only downside for me were the breakfasts as it was the same selection every day so I skipped a few mornings which was a waste as I‚Äôd paid extra for that.
Overall I would stay at the The Address again.
",4,2021,08,01
219,Totally unexpected luxury .,Stayed here last Saturday night as our Travel Department holiday was leaving from here on Sunday morning. Very impressed with the hotel entirely. Staff were amazing . A box of chocolates was left in our room for my friend who was celebrating her 70th birthday. We had lunch in the restaurant which was very tasty and the breakfast was excellent. Our room was spotless and had everyone we could possibly need. I will look forward to staying here again and would have no hesitation in recommending it .,5,2021,07,31
219,Absolutely amazing experience!!!!!,"I highly recommend this hotel to all ages, I went with my boyfriend and we just had the most amazing time. Everyone working there is very friendly and welcoming and made us feel at ease. The place is beautifully decorated and impeccably clean! ",5,2021,07,31
219,Perfect for our Dublin break,"Modern, clean hotel with all the amenities needed. Staff at the front desk and the bar were great, nothing was too much trouble. Good location too. All round a great place to stay. Cant comment on breakfast as I didn‚Äôt have it however it smelt fantastic.",5,2021,07,29
219,A nice surprise,"After spending the last number of months in confinement with the lockdown we were looking for an overnight stay in the city centre and the Avenue certainly ticked all the boxes.This hotel has recently been given a major facelift and the minute you walk  in the decor creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The highlight of our stay was the beautiful 3 course meal served in Mc Gettingans resturant. This was included in our "" Taste the Address"" offer which I would highly recommend. A really enjoyable stay and and we will definitely book a return visit.",4,2021,07,27
219,Long weekend,"Modern clean friendly hotel , excellent location super staff would highly recommend it , will be back .we had an upgrade to our room and the super coffee maker and fridge in our room was an added plus ",5,2021,07,27
219,"Fabulous room, gorgeous hotel",All the staff were really friendly and helpful. We stayed in a lovely room that has digitally controlled curtains and air con (rare occasion where Ireland was over 25 degrees). Great nights sleep. Super close to the train station so great base for visiting the city. We will definitely be back. Great value for money ,5,2021,07,26
219,Absolutely what we needed,"Our intention was a quick break away from the kids, local in the city, good food, good drinks, good sleep, but the hotel rooms were fantastic, AC in a heatwave was a god send, the contemporary nature of the decor was throughout the hotel and made our stay great. Will definitely return when we find another babysitter ",5,2021,07,25
219,"Everything fine, but....","...there was a problem with the smell from the kitchen. We had a room on street level. If yopu sleep wit an open window, there will be a bad surprise in the morning. All the smell from the old frying fat wakes you up before breakfast. That was the only negative, but an important one. The staff is outstanding helpful and friendly. The Restaurant offers relly good food. The breakfast is a nice one, if you are in favour of a full Irish breakfast.",4,2021,07,25
219,Very Welcoming,The Staff couldn‚Äôt have been more welcoming absolutely everyone was so good especially after the loss of Chrisse during our previous staff it was hard to go back without Chrisse we weren‚Äôt sure we could but soon as we arrived the welcome and care we received was amazing Bernie McCormack or myself Esther Tate  wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else so Thsnk you so much to everyone üíï,5,2021,07,24
219,Ideal for shopping break,"The hotel was convenient and very well maintained.  The reception staff were excellent , friendly and helpful.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Only down side was the food in bar was only average at best( and priced well above)  and breakfast was stone cold and not edible. I will skip both of these on my next stay but overall the hotel itself was great .",4,2021,07,23
219,Fantastic hotel/,"I originally chose the hotel merely on location and reasonable pricing. We were surprised at the beautiful interior setting and cleanliness.  the hotel was the staff was impressive; Very courteous, attentive and detail oriented. Thank You for making our 2 weeks in Dublin a great experience! ",5,2021,07,18
219,Interiors to die for,"Love the style of this hotel!! Staff were incredible, welcoming and warm, especially returning post covid.
Will 100% stay again. Was such a convenient location for different city centre location visits. ",5,2021,07,16
219,Fantastic stay in the heart of Dublin!,"This is my second time staying in the hotel and it won‚Äôt be my last! It is a great location, has so much places to eat and drink and even has its own gym/sauna. The staff are all so kind and helpful. A special shout out to Dawid and Sylvia, they made our stay that bit more perfect! ",5,2021,07,12
219,Fab hotel great deals and lovely staff,Staff were great all around and rooms were lovely and clean. The only thing that would give a little better is if you could order drinks not on the menu e.g pornstar Martini and some more food options but with covid and everything completely understandable will definitely be back ,4,2021,07,10
219,Good location for the Dublin train,The Address is a great location for the Dublin train but in an area which does not real that safe in the evening. The hotel is taking full advantage of Covid regulations with much reduced services but not reduced prices.. Despite having a suite there was not even a bottle of water in the room. Nor was there bathrobes. The bar staff were friendly.,3,2021,07,03
219,Well worth  a visit,"Stayed here while working close by, the hotel is extremely well presented and well maintained the rooms are of a high standard, the restaurant and bar area also fitted out, the only one complaint I would have is that the pillows are really hard! ",5,2021,07,03
219,üëå,Really really lovely hotel the staff were so welcoming and The atmosphere in the place was great and the room was absolutely gorgeous couldn‚Äôt of asked for better. The food was really nice also will definitely be booking again üëåüôÇ,5,2021,06,27

219,Fantastic second stay.,We stayed here in December for two nights and had an issue with the room next door. So the hotel gave us a night ok the house and we actually stayed an extra night on too again. The staff are lovely. Rooms are gorgeous. Very clean. Amazing hotel! Thank you so so much. We will definitely be back. ,5,2021,06,24
219,"Should be a 5 star hotel, absolutely fab stay!!","Just returned from 2 nights at the Address. Our room was absolutely beautiful with a stunning view, we had a lovely decking area/lounge with outside area beside our room which we sat on and had some drinks in the evening Looking out over Dublin. Right across the road from train station which was so handy and a ten min walk into city centre. Everything about the hotel was absolutley faultless and top class including the staff, food and facilities. The price for what we got was unbelievable. Stay here and I promise you won't regret it!! Thank you the Address, I am already looking at dates to return over the Summer.",5,2021,06,23
219,Great hotel,"We were coming up to Dublin for one night and were looking for a hotel with a great restaurant. My partner found The Address Connolly and we were lucky to get a great package deal: ‚Ç¨159 for 1 night with breakfast, cocktails and a 3-course dinner for 2 people. The dinner was delicious and the room was big and very comfortable. We had a small snag with the bathroom mirror flashing continuously for the first 2-3 minute upon checking into the room, but after that it seemed to sort itself out.",4,2021,06,15
219,Fantastic stay,"Our first trip away after lockdown and we couldn‚Äôt compliment the hotel more, the staff were so lovely and helpful in every way especially Keith and the girls at reception. Our room was so clean and comfy. We will definitely be back.",5,2021,06,13
219,Not happy,"The staff in this hotel were terrible, they were rude and not accommodating. The restaurant made us wait 15 mins for our reservation and then took so much time to serve our table and when we called a waiter to see if we could order some drinks due to long wait, he replied rudely ‚Äòare you talking to me‚Äô. I find this kind of behaviour unacceptable and it does not hurt to try and be kind to your guests. ",1,2021,06,12
219,"Beautiful hotel, Even better staff","The hotel is designed so well with a modern, elegant feel. The rooms are also superb, however a way to access Netflix could be a great addition and selling point for the hotel. The restaurant is also very aesthetic with a beautiful dimly lit bar ideal for dinners. Unfortunately the steak we ordered for dinner was disappointing. It came very thin and rare served with plain spinach leaves and skinny French fries. This seemed too basic, not only for the price of 26‚Ç¨ but also for such a beautiful hotel which deserves equally beautiful food. Nevertheless there was one thing that over shadows the dinner and all other great aspects of this hotel, and that is the staff. Without any exaggeration every single member of staff was an absolute delight. So welcoming, so helpful and such hard workers! Staff really make a difference in the quality of a hotel and this staff has definitely succeeded in elevating the quality of experience in The Address Hotel. Hence we can not wait to return as often as possible. 
",5,2021,06,10
219,Super stay with super staff,"I had a great stay recently in The Address Connolly. The staff are all very helpful and hardworking, especially Keith who was very good to us! I would highly recommend a stay here as the location is also very central!
",4,2021,06,08
219,Fantastic...,This is about our 10th. stay and it still doesn't fail to impress. Just reopened after the rece T lock down things seemed a bit chaotic especially in the restaurant but the service was second to none. David who took our order and looked after us couldn't do any more. Sean behind the bar was as usual as solid as a rock.,5,2021,06,07
219,Brilliant,"What a fabulous stay! All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, especially Keith and the ladies at reception. The food and service in the restaurant is top class
Can‚Äôt wait to book in for another stay",5,2021,06,05
219,very good hotel with excellent service close to the centre of Dublin,"It was for me a bussiness trip and I was in the hotel for two weeks. Although I had a room just above the railway, which is crossing the hotel, I feel really comfortable and pleased. Especially the service during the Coruna pandemic was very good.
You will find rooms for every wallet and can enjoy the lounge over the roofs of Dublin, a walk to the docks or chanal area or the centre of city which is very close.",4,2021,05,23
219,Lovely stay,"Had a morning meeting at IFSC, and hotel was a 2 minute walk away so it was incredibly convenient.  Remarkably quiet given proximity to Connolly Station.  Staff could not have been more friendly or welcoming, and my evening meal was delicious as well.  Would happily stay again and recommend to anyone.  ",5,2021,05,07

219,CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN!!!,"I love this hotel!!  I love the staff, the decor,  the food, drink, the room.

219,Excellent.,We were hope for a Family member‚Äôs funeral and we couldn‚Äôt have been better looked after. Staff were extremely compassionate yet professional and extremely aware of our wants & needs while remaining 100% respectful of the current health restrictions. Thank you so very much. ,5,2021,01,08
219,Fantastic Hotel,I stayed here last week with a couple of friends and it was fab. The room was gorgeous - very high tech and the bed was super comfortable. The location is great -  Right in the heart of town near all the shops and beside the train station and Luas stop. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we had a lovely meal with terrific cocktails in McGettigans Cookhouse. I would highly recommend a stay here and will definitely be back.,5,2020,12,23
219,lovely boutique hotel,"Stayed here for a lovely catch up with friends in early December, great location , so central and shopping only 5 mins away. Overall our whole trip was fantastic , from food service , to drinks , breakfast , bedrooms , all was superb and felt very safe at all times in the hotel. We had dinner in Mcgettigans and it was so nice to have good food and a few drinks in such a buzzy atmosphere with exceptionally friendly and attentive staff.  The decor of the hotel is lovely and reminds me of some of the trendy boutique hotels in london. Will definitely be coming back as very good value on the taste of the address package.",5,2020,12,23
219,What a little gem!,"Myself and a few friends availed of the wonderfully priced package of cocktail, dinner and B &B in the Address Connolly. The experience over-delivered to be honest. What a lovely time we had afternoon shopping in nearby Henry St followed by a fabulous dinner in the restaurant. The food was fantastic - I recommend the prawns - and the service was Very friendly and efficient. The funky interiors were beautifully decorated for Christmas and it made our get together very special to meet after so long in such a festive setting.  The beds were unbelievably comfortable, bathroom spotlessly clean and I loved the touch button controls for the curtains, air conditioning, etc. As we were on 6th floor, we woke the following morning to beautiful views of the Bustling city, enjoyed a wonderful breakfast and headed for the Dart home. Great place for a meet up and will definitely be using it again. It‚Äôs so nice to leave a four star hotel feeling that you‚Äôve had great value for money. Well done The Address Connolly!",5,2020,12,21
219,Highly recommend,"Had a great stay here with some girlfriends after the lockdown!  The hotel has got a fabulous refurbishment, felt like I was in a 5 star hotel. The location is perfect, staff are very nice and helpful. Will definitely be back!",5,2020,12,20

The food in the McGettigans cook house restaurant was delicious and the cocktails were excellent. Overall would happily recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a break away in Dublin.,5,2020,12,14
219,Amazing hotel!,I recently stayed with my partner on the 'Taste The Address' package. We both felt very safe as there was strict Covid-19 protocols in place. The room was very modern and spacious with gorgeous views of Connolly Station. We stayed on the club level and the rooms were to a 5 star standard and beautifully designed. Our meal was tremendous and we received incredible service from Keith and David. I could not recommend this hotel more. We will definitely be back in the New Year.,5,2020,12,14
219,Lovely evening with friends before Christmas,"4 of us decided to stay here based on the very good room rate and dine elsewhere in the city in early December.
The room was very small with two double beds but very clean and comfortable. Only negative about the room was the window had a draught and one of the group felt it all night and was unable to get comfortable due to the cold breeze.
The lady in reception (unfortunately didn‚Äôt get her name) was absolutely lovely and couldn‚Äôt have done more for us while we stayed.
Lastly- the night Porter was a little rude when we got back to the hotel after our meal, he couldn‚Äôt believe there were 4 of us staying in one room and demanded he see 4 keycards.
Would recommend for the price and central location and is one of the cleanest hotels I‚Äôve stayed in.",4,2020,12,13
219,Potential to be great but some things ruined it for us,"The hotel itself is lovely, the room was fab and spotless and the location was handy. Our room came with no remote control for the tv which is what helped you access the WiFi etc we called down to report this to be told it was there but after searching again we could see that it wasn‚Äôt. We reported it with reception who told us one would be sent up. It wasn‚Äôt. 
In the bar we asked for a cocktail, and were told that they didn‚Äôt have the ingredients to make them and it was just what was on the menu. Later on the table next to us ordered the exact same drink and it was no problem so not sure why we were lied to about the ingredients? The first waiter in the bar was also rude on 2 more occasions. Again we understand it was opening week but you could tell he didn‚Äôt like us for no reason. Our waiter in the restaurant David however was fantastic. He really looked after us the whole night in the restaurant. He made our night. These things are quite minor, but it just made us feel like our stay had the potential to be good but the staff let it down (not David!) so for this reason we all said we probably wouldn‚Äôt stay again. Lovely hotel though, and the food in the restaurant was nice. ",3,2020,12,07
219,Fabulous hotel but we didn‚Äôt receive our full package,"Everything about the hotel was perfect. Staff were very friendly and welcoming especially in the restaurant. The room was beautiful and perfectly presented. We loved it.  we had booked and paid for a particular package called the ‚Äòone fine stay‚Äô package which included Prosecco and chocolates on arrival, evening meal and breakfast. We stayed 2 nights. The package was all perfect but the room we booked was not the room we got. We booked the premier king room which included a deluxe king bed, coffee machine, en-suite bathroom with rainforest shower and a bath, robes and slippers on arrival and rose petals scattered on the bed. While the room itself was lovely it was not what we paid for. We were missing the robe and slippers and the rose petals were not placed until late at night and the bathroom was not the bathroom described. We also were supposed to receive a ‚Ç¨20 voucher for the address collective hotels which we never received. 
During our stay I ordered another pillow which I didn‚Äôt receive until I queried it 3 times.  ",5,2020,12,07
219,A must stay place in Dublin,Calm oasis in the heart of Dublin city. Staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay- special mention to our barman turned waiter! All Covid measures in place without compromising the experience. It is a fabulous  place to stay and decorated to the highest standards. ,5,2020,10,28
219,Great stay and staff,We booked with the front line workers deal and were treated with the highest of standards! Staff went above and beyond and were very accommodating and professional. Will definitely be back when it‚Äôs open! ,5,2020,10,27
219,Fantastic,"Superb, rooms are beautiful ,bed very comfortable. Staff extremely friendly,fantastic value for money. We will definetly recommend here and look forward to returning as soon as it is possible. Beautifully decorated.",5,2020,10,24
219,Perfect stay,The beds were very comfortable and the view was amazing from our room. Staff was also very helpful with an issue regarding our tv which was sorted very quickly. Will be staying again. Close to the train tracks which can be heard in the morning but nothing too interrupting. ,5,2020,10,23
219,We loved it!!,"My husband and I loved our stay! The staff was lovely, the food was delicious and the club suit was great! Very clean, spacious.
The bed was very comfy! We booked the club suit with the couples pack. We will definitely be back!",5,2020,10,12
219,Relaxing stay for a birthday during covid -19 restrictions,"We stayed here during covid restrictions for my partners birthday. The hotel set up made us feel completely at ease with sanitising stations located throughout and a good system in place for check - in. We were helped by Andrew and Luke who couldn‚Äôt have been nicer and were extremely friendly. We ate at mcgettigans during our stay, the waiter on the night, 9th Oct, was so friendly. The food was good, dessert in particular. The room was very spacious and nicely decorated, with all mod cons, exceptionally clean throughout. The area of the hotel is centrally located right beside Connelly station and a short walk away from Grafton street / O‚ÄôConnell street.",5,2020,10,11
219,Lovely rooms,"Our room was clean and very modern. The smart controls for the lighting etc is a great feature. However our air con was broke and the room was very warm so we had quite an uncomfortable night, the receptionist did bring us a fan which helped a bit. The food in the restaurant was decent, they had a limited menu due to covid which is understandable although at least one vegetarian option would have been nice. The staff were polite and although the service we received wasn‚Äôt bad, it wasn‚Äôt great either we got the impression that some of the staff really didn‚Äôt want to be there and we felt awkward asking for things. Overall this is a lovely hotel but improvements are needed. For the price we paid it wasn‚Äôt great and we probably won‚Äôt stay again.",3,2020,10,05
219,Good location,friendly an helpful staff room was good size liked the wee touch button on the wall for the different lights.Beds& pillows were comfortable all &all we had lovely stay.The location was great for public transport.,4,2020,09,20
219,"Exceptional stay, wonderful staff","As our planned wedding was postponed until next year due to the pandemic we decided to visit Dubllin for a few days.

Thanks to Peter and his team for a wonderful and memorable stay

with special thanks to Rhona, David in the restaurant,Silvia and Tony

Looking forward to returning in the near future.",5,2020,09,16
219,Break With Sisters,"Catching with Sisters as often as possible 
Gone from 11 sisters to 2 so we need to value time together  while we can and as both live a bit away we choose to meet up at the Address Connolly for our Catchup",5,2020,09,15
219,Enjoyable but slightly underwhelming,"The classic rooms are okay and have the basis of a nice stay but for a four star hotel it did not step up to the plate. Hallways up to the rooms have old cracked and discoloured paint on the walls plus carpet that looked to be old/stained and did not smell great. This was very offputting considering the voyeur and lounge area is so nice and clean. Staff were very friendly. Any faults with this hotel are fixable but surely could not go unnoticed by managers. The internet connection was also not good in the room. I expected noise due to the station near by but i feel as though something could be done to sound proof the bedrooms as i could hear next doors conversations. Breakfast was served nicely put again not up to par considering this is a 4 star hotel. 
",3,2020,08,29
219,Excellent stay,"I booked this for my boyfriends 30th, I had asked before I arrived about doing something for him and they said not a problem they would sort it. From we first arrived until we left, the service and friendliness from the staff was first class I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough! They had arranged a birthday dessert plate in the room with chocolates and a card for my boyfriends 30th! The resturant within the hotel was something else! ",5,2020,08,18
219,Love staying here,"The room was fantastic and the staff are lovely, have stayed here a few times before and I'm always happy to come back again. Close enough to walk to town and a taxi rank outside also the restaurant attached is a great place to eat ",5,2020,08,17
219,Highly recommend,"Very helpful staff. Location is superb,Very close to the train station  very clean and the staff very helpful. Highly recommended!! Will definitely book this hotel again when we visit Dublin in the future!",5,2020,08,17
219,Another great visit.,"Myself and my husband stay here multiple times throughout each year and have done so for the last 7 years. We are just returning from another lovely stay, the Address room we stayed in was beautiful and modern, we usually stay in the Premier suite room but this time we had an Address room and it was stunning. We had a beautiful, freshly cooked breakfast served by Peter, a true gentleman who was pleasant, professional, friendly and welcoming, the breakfast set us up for the day ahead and was super tasty. We look forward to returning in November for my usual birthday trip. The reason we return each time to this hotel and no other is because its close to all amenities,its quiet, modern and stylish.5 star treatment is guaranteed from the moment a guest arrives until they leave.As a couple we 100% recommend.",5,2020,08,14
219,Break ,"Really enjoyed our stay over the staff were fantastic and friendly, the hotel was clean and Covid friendly hand sanitiser everywhere the food was delicious and breakfast was to die for, only fault we dnt stay longer, the rooms are high tec, ",5,2020,08,12
219,Family break,staff were excellent !!! Customer service excellent a great staff from bar staff managers reception couldn't do enough for us very friendly and I have emailed the general manager personally to congratulate him on his staff .. ,4,2020,08,07
219,Lovely modern central hotel,"Central to bus ,train ,luas, amazing food especially the fish and chips and wings... very friendly reception staff our second time to visit and we will return... mcgettigans bar in the hotel.. comfortable rooms ",5,2020,07,27
219,Shopping trip,Stayed in the North Star hotel with my family to go on a shopping trip. Throughly enjoyed the relaxing experience and I would certainly recommend the hotel to my friends. After coming out of lockdown I couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better way to enjoy the freedom. All being well we will all hopefully return in the not to distant future.,5,2020,07,25
219,Average but pleasant stay,"Arrived to find we were being complimentary room upgraded which was a nice little bonus. The room was immaculate and we really enjoyed the automatic curtain/lights system although we did find that the 'floor lights' were disruptive at night as they would turn on to the slightest motion detected right into the early hours (tried everything to keep them off/turn them off etc, perhaps we were just missing something obvious?!) The only other criticism was the disruption of the train track which runs right next to the hotel and runs right up to midnight and seems to start up again in the early hours. We are not particularly light sleepers and still found this hard to tune out. 

Hotel spotless, decent location if you dont mind a bit of a walk and all the staff we interracted with were pleasant and friendly. Food in the on site restaurant was also lovely.",3,2020,07,19
219,The North Star is a star.,"Loved every minute here. The staff were amazing, especially in these weird times. They went out of their way to make our stay perfect and helped so much with my daughter who is in a wheelchair.  Super advocates for keeping us safe and sanitised during these pandemic months. One of the biggest bonuses has got to be the amazing food. Just perfect. Nothing was too much hassle. ",5,2020,07,14
219,Amazing Service,"From the moment we entered the property we were greeted by the concierge and the Manager on duty. The receptionist was friendly and we'll informed regarding all the Covid19 regulations. She organised an upgrade for us to the most beautiful room laden with modern technology.
Layer that evebing we had a meal in the cookhouse and our server David was such a character, friendly, funny and conversational without being intrusive. The service we received in the cookhouse was nothing short of wonderful. Thank you Davidüòä",5,2020,07,09
219,How helpful staff was to me!!,"I made a reservation with Linda and I cannot tell you how helpful she was and this was through a email. I had to change a date . When I email to ask could I change the dates, as I was dreading it incase I couldn't but Linda reasurred me it was ok and change the dates that best suited me. The stress lifted !! Thank you Linda you are very professional at your job.",5,2020,07,08
219,Amazing hotel and great location,"Great hotel and good location , near the train station, staff very friendly and rooms very clean , will definitely visit this hotel again. Restaurant at hotel , food was delicious . Everything about hotel was good  , could not fault this hotel at all. ",5,2020,07,07
219,Great lunch stop,"Not been an overnight guest, but had lunch a number of times.  

Great menu and well prepared food.  Tuna salad particularly good.  Centrally located beside main train station and bus centre, close to most tourist spote.",5,2020,04,13
219,Superb 2 night anniverary,"OK, it was a 30th wedding anniversary trip which was I am sure the reason for the free room upgrade.

However, the addition of chocolates, cupcakes and a well-written card was a great surprise.

The hotel is quirky as you would hope for a Dublin experience.

Several places to find inc the cocktail bar, main bar & The Cellar used just for breakfast.

This included an all you can eat buffet and even a pancake machine ... a pancake machine I tell you.

The hospitality terrace is the best place for a nightcap with heated outdoor views over the city.

It is ideally situated for transport links and a 10-minute walk from the tiver & less to the shops etc.

Sincerely can't thank the staff enough for all their friendliness & attention to their guests.

Thank you all for making our two nights stay so memorable.

Fay & Colin.",5,2020,03,26
219,An American in Ireland during CoronaVirus and the kindest people ever,"Last week, we traveled to Ireland. We had never been there before so I was a bit nervous.  After landing and finding our trip back had been canceled and we had no way home, then figuring out how to drive on the other side of the road-in the rain-we got to the hotel a bit frazzled. When we walked in we were greeted by the jolliest man who bellowed ""Welcome to Ireland!"" That was exactly what we needed. From him, to our favorite bartender Sean, this place is tops! When we had to cut our trip short due to Covid-19, the woman at the desk was so kind and helpful.  We plan on traveling back as soon as it is safe and I will not stay anywhere else.",5,2020,03,22
219,definitely worth a stay,"stayed in the Address for the second time and definitely recommend- its a different class - beautiful, modern, airy rooms - friendly helpful staff and fantastic facilities- Dublin was more or less on lockdown so we were so fortunate in having such a wonderful room. Have already booked next time hopefully when the world is back normal.",5,2020,03,22
219,Nice,Nice hostel in the center of Dublin and nice price for the breakfast. The rooms are nice and quiet the and is really clean if you need any information go to the desk and he help you. You ca. Stay your luggage and come back after,5,2020,03,20
219,Covid-19 Crisis City Break,"The North Star Hotel, aka ‚ÄúThe Address‚Äù, is indeed beautiful and ideally situated across from Connolly Station.  However, along with thousands of others, my husband and I got caught out by the Covid-19 crisis in the run-up to St. Patrick‚Äôs Day.  We weren‚Äôt going to Dublin for the parade but for a much-anticipated concert to celebrate our upcoming wedding anniversary. The concert was understandably cancelled.  As soon as Ticketmaster notified me, I immediately phoned the hotel and Booking.com to cancel our room, but to no avail.  I understood the terms and conditions I had signed to, but thought this an extraordinary circumstance.  Also, my bit of income is from working as a home carer and I didn‚Äôt want to bring back coronavirus back to clients, family and friends.  I then pleaded my case directly to the hotel manager in an email, and although he replied, he refused a refund.  

So although Dublin went into near lock-down, with pubs, restaurants and museums closed (as they should have been), we took a risk and drove all the way from Sligo as not to waste the room.  Upon arriving the hotel lobby was empty, unsurprisingly so, and the few staff present had an odd manner, perhaps terrified they were losing their jobs soon.  We checked into our pristine digs impressed by the high-tech specs, coffee machine, rain shower, linens, toiletries and plush bathrobes.  No complimentary bottle of wine, alas ‚Äì that would have been a nice gesture for our trouble ;)  Hoping for the best but with some trepidation we hit out into the eerily deserted, but lucky for us, sunny streets and parks of Dublin.  We kept our distance from the few, but happy St. Paddy's revellers, but felt guilty of just being there, not self-isolating.  Back at the hotel I refused to give another penny to dine in restaurant, so had brought in a picnic and bottle of discount vino from home into our fancy room.  Washed hands repeatedly.  Later in the evening we took a chance of availing of the free tea and coffee in the rooftop lounge, all alone, overlooking a quiet Connolly in the rain.  It was as if we were watching an Apocalypse movie from our posh perch.  We might have been fools for not cancelling altogether, but due to our sense of adventure, macabre sense of humour, and determination not to throw away our hard-earned money, we made this trip work. Hopefully we don‚Äôt end up ill and pass it on.  I feel truly terrible for the struggling hospitality industry, because we are all facing tough times, but won‚Äôt be booking ‚ÄúThe Address‚Äù or use Booking.com again.  Keep well and be decent to each other, readers.",1,2020,03,19
219,Nice place,"It's a little way from most of Dublin's attractions, but walkable if you like a walk.

Nice rooms, friendly, helpful staff.  A nice bar.  Didn't try the restaurant, but it looked good.

I didn't see any facial tissues in the room.  The LED lights which switched on with motion were kind of annoying.  Those are the only minor nits I'll pick.",4,2020,03,18
219,Weekend in Dublin,"Arrived here on Friday morning at about 9am, wasn‚Äôt supposed to check in till 2pm but went to see if we could leave our suitcases there until then and was told our room was ready for us so we could check in early which was brilliant. All the staff were so helpful and friendly, the hotel was such a nice standard for the price! Some of my other family were staying at a different hotel for the same price and wasn‚Äôt half as nice. The room was a good size, had a nice little coffee station with a kettle, big size telly and the comfiest bed ever. The bathroom was nice and modern too! Managed to add on an extra night on the Sunday too which was easily sorted with the lady at reception and didn‚Äôt have to change rooms for that either! Will definitely be staying here again next time I‚Äôm in Dublin :) ",5,2020,03,16
219,Fantastic hotel,"We had an amazing couple of days here, staff were exceptional and the bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in.  The location is perfect for exploring Dublin, we would highly recommend The Address At Dublin 1",5,2020,03,16
219,Staff is friendly,Hotel is clean. With lounges on 7th floor you have a great view. Can not believe it is not a 5 star. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Concierge is there to help you with anything you need be it a advice or a reservation. Food is delicious in Mcgettigans cookhouse,5,2020,03,15
219,No balcony as per booked,Hotel is beautiful and excellent location. Upgrade was appreciated BUT was not what we wanted! We precooked to have a balcony months in advance and felt disappointed upon arrival. Pent house club lounge was nice but still no compensation for lack of balcony,4,2020,03,14
219,Super stay in the city centre,"Great hotel, lovely rooms and easy to get to and from the airport as well as into the town and the Temple Bar area!
We had a lovely twin room , shower was good, beds comfy and always love a dressing gown!",5,2020,03,14
219,Pleasant Surprise,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Can‚Äôt praise it enough. Staff extremely helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was one of the best I‚Äôve had. Lots of variety. Temperature in room was good. Very clean and fab location.,5,2020,03,13
219,"Positives, but more negatives on this occasion...","Firstly, I‚Äôll start with the positives, all of the staff were very attentive and extremely friendly. Bar food and drinks all amazing, including breakfast, although I feel breakfast is a little over priced.

So, let‚Äôs talk about the negatives which I feel outweighs the positives on this occasion. Our room was very tired looking, but seems ok on first instance. However, the bathroom was VERY tired on further inspector. None of the plug sockets on the dressing area worked, the board was in fact very loose therefore didn‚Äôt want to mess about with them with fear of potential electrocution. Our biggest annoyance/disappointment came upon pulling the curtains back to discover what can only be described as a building site!!!! I was absolutely disgusted with what I saw, to the point we didn‚Äôt see any natural day light in the room for 48 hours as I kept the curtains drawn as couldn‚Äôt bare to look at the mess outside. As if this wasn‚Äôt bad enough, on Monday morning morning we we very rudely awoken by work men clambering, talking, banging, grinding outside our bedroom window BEFORE 8am!!!! There is NO warning upon booking this hotel that there are in fact massive outside renovation going on which WILL cause a disruption to your stay. I understand that hotels have to partake in work to keep the hotel up to scratch. However, paying customers should be made aware of such disruption when paying over ‚Ç¨150 per night to stay there. This has left a VERY sour taste in my mouth which I am extremely upset over.",3,2020,03,12
219,Really beautiful hotel,"Really beautiful hotel, internally adjourned to The Address @ Dublin 1. Great breakfast including gluten free option. Bar is lovely and all staff super helpful. Rooms were amazing too. All lights lamps curtains etc operated by touch sensitive pad on wall. Immaculate.",5,2020,03,11
219,Fantastic Hotel,This Hotel is just beautiful and so clean and everything in the rooms is operated by touch sensor buttons. Staff are lovely and friendly and helpful. Breakfast was lovely. Bar staff are really nice too.,5,2020,03,11
219,Best hotel ever!,"Could not fault this hotel one bit! Everything was beyond perfect! Staff were lovely and very attentive! Can‚Äôt wait to return! Couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel more. Food was fantastic and the hotel was always spotless. Perfect for friend, family or couples nights away! ",5,2020,03,10
219,Dublin spring break,Nice long weekend trip to Dublin ... close to O'Connel Street and the Temple bar area. All the restaurant's and bar's easy to get to and the bus tour's are amazing. Hotel staff and reception very helpful ... will definitely be returning. Large comfortable bed and room layout. Everything you would want for your stay ...,5,2020,03,10
219,Excellent location,Would have been 5 stars had we had the balcony we booked. We were upgraded but it still was not what we wanted. Excellent location and beautifully decorated. Coffee machine was temperamental and leaked every now and again so a kettle would have been much simpler and efficient ,4,2020,03,10
219,Dublin weekend,"Good location, quick and easy check in. Food was good , especially the breakfast. Staff were friendly. However we were not warned that the hotel is undergoing renovation. Bathroom was very tired and in need of updating. Would stay again ,when the renovation is complete",4,2020,03,10
219,Highly recommended,"Had a fantastic stay. Staff were very welcoming, room was to a high standard. Building under renovation (externally) however this did not alter my experience or impact my staff. 

Did not visit the gym or sauna so cannot pass judgement of that. 

Lovely that the hotel has a premium lounge as this was an unexpected surprise.

Would definitely visit next time I travel to Dublin. Will also be recommending to others.

Stayed between 7th and 8th March 2020.",5,2020,03,09
219,one night only,"Great location, very hepful and friendly staff, excellent room size. Couldnt have hoped for a better welcome, arrived earlier than check in time , no problem taking our bags and upon check out was asked again did we need luggage stored nothing was too much bother!",5,2020,03,09
219,Great Staff,"Very friendly and helpful staff. They tended to our needs with great care and thoughtfulness. Check in was quick and easy. The room was exactly what had been represented online. Great, central location. Will definitely be staying again. ",5,2020,03,08
219,excellent one night stay,"stayed for one night and had a great experience from the start. Excellent welcome for Darrus.. Hotel was easy to find and we checked in with no issues
very friendly and knowledgeable
Room was on 6th floor.. and fully aware view was scaffolding and work is currently getting completed however it HD no impact on out stay

However apart from that spot one.. left case the next day as we werent getting picked up till later.. no issues with storage
all staff very helpful and friendly
would stay again.. very close to everything ",4,2020,03,08
219,Great hotel for a honeymoon!,"My husband and I stayed at the North Star hotel on our first nights in Ireland, and so it was really the hotel that kicked off our trip and set our expectations for the rest of our accommodations- and it did NOT disappoint! 

The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was small but well appointed, the bathroom was a good size and updated to a modern finish. 

Breakfast was well worth the cost per day, and the small cellar restaurant was a wonderful atmosphere to start the day in. Mid century modern and very hip, good food and good service. There was a wide selection for all diets, from a full and hearty Irish breakfast to a light nibble for vegetarian eaters. They even had separate gluten free breads. 

The location was excellent for those who like to walk their vacation spots- mostly everything local to Dublin was a reasonable walking distance - and if things got a bit too far there was never a shortage of Uber or Free Now cabs to help. 

The mattress was firm but comfortable. 

There is no on site parking which could be a bit problematic if you have a rental car. 

The bus stations were very close by and we never had any issue finding our way by bus from from the airport or even up to Newgrange. ",5,2020,03,08
219,Will stay here again,"I have stayed in the  North Star Hotel several times. This time was special as it was a brief stay for a friend's 50th birthday.  The location is excellent. Five minutes from the City centre. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I would like to offer a special thanks to Isabel, Gabi and Veronica who went the extra mile to make our stay more enjoyable. Very friendly and professional staff. Anyway I will stay at the North Star again. Looking forward to it. My only suggestion would be that some veggie sausages would be included in the breakfast buffet too so one can have a full cooked veggie breakfast too. Five stars!",5,2020,03,06
219,Perfect as a base for 3 Arena,"My sisters and I picked the Nort Star Hotel as its across the road from Connelly Station and only 20 minutes walk from 3 Areana. The hotel staff were friend and the room clean. The facilities, restaurants and bars were great.",4,2020,03,06
219,Great standards of cleanliness & service,"Housekeeping was exceptional with a very keen eye for detail and reception staff were very friendly and quick to help when needed.
The 7th Floor Lounge was very much appreciated for a quick breakfast or afternoon drinks. 
Very comfortable rooms with easy to use technology.",5,2020,03,03
219,Great weekend,Myself and my partner had such a good weekend from start to finish. Room was amazing so clean and everything we needed. Bar was great and food was so nice. All the staff were so professional and friendly honestly could not fault our stay and looking forward to going back ,5,2020,03,02
219,Go elsewhere!,"Really disappointing stay. We paid over ¬£200 a night and it was worth nothing of the sort!
1. We were not forewarned about (or offered any recompense for) the current building work going on. As we had not only scaffolding but the scaffolding staircase literally right outside our window with various workmen coming and going we had no choice but to keep the curtains closed at all times, making us feel like we were staying in a claustrophobic box rather than what is advertised as a 'luxury' hotel. Aside from this, the room was nothing special
2. The 'panoramic views of Dublin' from the Club Lounge boasted about by the hotel are nothing of the sort - simply train tracks and nearby buildings (nothing beyond that!). The 'wonderful roof top area' description is also a joke. It's just a small smoking area with a smelly, overflowing ashtray to prove it (staff clearly never go up there to clean it)
3. The breakfast quality and range was poor and definitely not of the standard one would expect from a supposed 4 star hotel (regularly items ran out which were not topped up by staff). The room was often over-crowded and one morning a young woman was dressed only in a dressing gown and insisted on crossing and uncrossing her legs showing WAY more of her anatomy than I would ever expect or want to see at breakfast!
We left feeling thoroughly ripped off.",1,2020,03,02
219,Fabulous stay,"The staff are all welcoming and nothing is too much trouble, the hotel is finished to a high standard and the rooms are lovely and clean, the location was ideal for us as within walking distance to the shopping centres and a short taxi ride to the night life, would highly recommended to friends and family ",5,2020,03,02
219,Pleasantly surprised as it was very much a lastminute booking.com,"Excellent staff, facilities perfect, excellent location. I would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to a revisiting in the future. Only observation it might be worth a mention to guests beforehand of the drilling/building work outside, thankfully we are early risers so it did not spoil our stay ",5,2020,03,02
219,An hotel for the train enthusiasts and nature lovers.,"Train enthusiasts will love the place because the train drives right through it.  Nature lovers will enthuse over all the cobwebs on the lamps. Seriously though, it only sounded like the train driving through. The noise didn‚Äôt bother me, but it would be remiss of me not to mention it. Poor cleaning standards were sadly real and is the only thing stopping this well placed and reasonably priced hotel from achieving a higher rating. There are however a number of positives about the hotel. The breakfasts were great, they even included a white pudding, not quite a Scottish white pudding but nevertheless good. The hotel has a good location, not far from the centre and with good, bus,train, and tram connections. The staff are polite and friendly. We had a small issue with our room, we hadn‚Äôt the promised balcony, due to building work. The staff upgraded us immediately and solved the problem, sadly the weather didn‚Äôt give us many chances to enjoy the view. This hotel is reasonable value for money.",3,2020,03,02
219,Great location ,Stayed here 2 nights while touring Dublin and we very impressed with the location. Near train station and within and easy walk of many restaurants and attractions. Service and staff at hotel and restaurant were friendly and helpful!,4,2020,03,01
219,Great hotel. Central location,"We were a little apprehensive getting off the bus in the dark and walking to the hotel, as the area seems a little run down.  But once we walked through the front doors the hotel was fab!  Loved the decor, friendly staff, food and drinks were fab.  The only 2 niggles I had were the bloody automatic lights in the room that came on when you turned over in bed (solved with throwing a cushion over the sensor) and the doors were a little noisy from neighbours.  Everything else, was brill.  Location, while questionable int he dark, we great for getting around the City.  Airlink bus is super close, short walk to the river, Hop On bus also really close too.  Would recommend.",5,2020,02,26
219,50th birthday ,"My partner and I went to this hotel for her 50th birthday, we stayed at what they call the Address part of the hotel . The hotel is nice ,clean and the staff were lovely and friendly. The room was lovely with the tech stuff especially when you get up to use the loo with the sensor lights under the bed side cabinet coming on. Just a couple of niggles in the bathroom. 1) The loo seat should have been a soft close one to stop it clattering down and waking my partner. 2) The bath plug would not raise to let out the water so had to pull it out with my fingers., 3) The mirror lights on the side of the mirror didn't work . This really all should be checked after each new guest arrives. The other issues I had was I booked a 4 course meal for me and my partner in the restaurant for Sunday evening at 8pm only to find the menu was the same as what was offered during the day, but only a selective choice from that menu you were allowed to have . There was other food on the board but that didn't come in with the 4 course so very limited. 
Also the restaurant is next to what the call the parlour which as a sliding door between the two rooms. Unfortunately the door seems to be always open so guests come from the bar through the restaurant    through the parlour to go to their rooms. At one stage around 8:30pm  the cleaner was hoovering the parlour floor and with the door open, totally spoilt our evening. 
At the moment at the rear of the hotel they are adding two more floors so building work is on going, we weren't told this when we booked  but we luckily we were there the weekend so no noise, but be aware if you are staying during the week. ",4,2020,02,25
219,Excellent modern hotel in heart of City Centre,"2-3 mins walk from O Connell St. 

Really enjoyed our stay, enjoyed cocktails in the hotel bar and the bed was super comfy. had a great experience while checking in, was able to get an upgrade so thanks to Luke at front desk for making our stay even better ! ",5,2020,02,25
219,Good food and great staff!,"Went to the bar for lunch on Sunday and the whole experience was really enjoyable. The food was great but our visit was made by Liz, she went above and beyond for us after I had a bit of a spillage on my top, a great member of your team, will definitely be back!!",5,2020,02,25
219,Amazing Refurb,"Place has had a makeover since the last time I stayed.  Really lovely, room comfortable with everything you need. Staff very helpful and restaurant good value. Close to the shops and bus station. Only  downside was Building work and scaffolding right outside the window, and a noisy generator which kicked in around 7am so my much looked forward to lie in didn‚Äôt happen. Had I been there for more than one night I would have asked to be moved. Despite that I would stay again but would seek out a quieter room. ",4,2020,02,25
219,North Star Hotel,"We had a 3 night break at the north star hotel as an amas present from our son. We arrived at the hotel about 10.30am to see if there was anywhere we could leave our cases. The lovely lady receptionist said she would see if any rooms were ready, and within 5 minutes we were relaxing in our room. Everything about this hotel is class, from the staff, the food and the luxury, will definitely be staying again. Alexander McLean ",5,2020,02,24
219,Very Good Value,Very clean modern hotel - close to train station and within walking distance of the city centre and temple bar - not the best view from the rooms but was nice and quiet and got a good night sleep - the reception staff are not overly friendly but the consierge Kieron is very helpful and his suggestions made our weekend stay all the better - would definitely stay here again and would recommend ,4,2020,02,24
219,Friends on tour,Beautiful hotel.Excellent location in dublin. It would of been 5 stars all the way but had a little issue get water temperature set right in shower. Small price for beautiful surroundings. Great value for money especially as in Dublin where it can be very expensive ,5,2020,02,24
219,Good stay,"Brilliant stay, upgraded to suit but disappointed about the scaffold and workmen walking past our windows so had to keep curtains closed constantly and the free facilities on level 7 were out of use because of flooding.",4,2020,02,24
219,"Fabulous, Except for that pesky train","Stayed here part of a tour package with Globus.  The hotel is in a pretty good location and is a 10 to 15 min walk to the Trinity College area.  It is a bit confusing as it is two hotels in one.  It is an older building so there are creeky floorboards in the halls and the rooms.  I noticed I had some in my room and tried to avoid them while I was getting up at 6am so I didn't bother the room below me.  I will admit, the hardwired hairdryer was a first for me.  I have never seen one hardwired into the wall!

The rooms were very clean as I had two different ones during my stay as we stayed here the first and last nights of the tour.  The beds and linens were comfy.  

I do wish there was more fresh fruit in the breakfast area other than the apples at reception.  That was the only downside.  I didn't have my banana or orange for the say available to me.

The staff was very nice and attentive.  There is a train that runs over the lobby and you are like what is this?  That is the only downside I saw.",4,2020,02,23
219,Great hotel,"We always enjoy staying at the North Star / The Address as it is nice and clean, the staff is friendly and the food at McGettigan‚Äôs is delicious. You can also get nice cocktails at the bar, pre or post dinner, for an enjoyable evening. It is also well located. Overall, a great stay every time. ",5,2020,02,23
219,Amazing hotel and staff,"Stayed here in February and I was really impressed. The hotel was a great location and the room was fantastic. On the second day in Dublin I was injured after being struck by a car. The staff were very helpful and accommodating, moving us to an accessible room to make our stay more comfortable and offering help with other aspects of the rest of the trip. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2020,02,21
219,Stayed here as part of a tour,"This was the last hotel of our tour of Ireland.  Before we arrived at the hotel, our tour guide informed us that we should wait for our bags to be unloaded from the coach and personally walk them inside the hotel to ensure they are not stolen.  My first thought was, how bad is the area around the hotel?  This was present on my mind during the entire stay.  Looking back, there were no issues and the area was nice enough.  There was a Spar convenience store at the end of the block and a pharmacy up the street from the Spar.  The number 4 stop on our hop on hop off bus tour was a couple blocks from this hotel.

The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly.  Breakfast in the mornings covered all the basics. They had difficulty seating more than 4 people together.  The coffee pots that were brought to the tables were really only big enough for one person but we managed.  

The rooms were clean and modern.  They looked recently renovated.  

There's a train that runs over the lobby between the buildings.",4,2020,02,18
219,Second visit to North Star Hotel,"When we travel to our nations capital there is only one hotel for us, The North Star.
The staff are really friendly from when they greet you when you arrive until your departure. Nice pleasant hotel tastefully decorated, great bar and restaurant. The premiere lounge on the 7th floor was really cool but as there was a technical fault on the second day we were given access to the premiere lounge at the Address part of the hotel.
The breakfast is amazing, this time it was included in the price of the room.
Some people say it‚Äôs a bit outside the main centre but it‚Äôs only a 10 minute walk to the GPO.
Parking nearby at Connolly station is ‚Ç¨9:50 per 24hours and free for blue badge holders.
Next time in Dublin guess were we will stay?",5,2020,02,18
219,"Mixed feelings, not average but neither very good!","Upon arrived when we checked in at the North Star the lady at the desk was very professional but forgot/omitted to mention the building works that are taking place in that wing of the hotel where the room was located.
So we walk in the room to find builders on scaffolding going constantly up and down from 9 am till 5pm. Drilling, banging and so on was very annoying. Due to the building works the room balcony was locked therefore we couldn‚Äôt use it. 

Then after a day out we came back and we was moved out to the 7th floor due to a number of leaks from the ceiling

The hotel update is for the inconvenience and moved us to The address at Dublin (a different wing). The room was very hi-tech, all touch switched for the lights and you could controlled all the tech features from the tv... very good if you as lazy as us üòÇ
However the room was facing the trains tracks and you could feel each and every train that passed, its Connolly station so immagine the volume of trains that transit there!
  
The hotel is very central and closed to shops, train stations and great pubs

I don‚Äôt know if I would go back to this establishment.

",3,2020,02,18
219,i would definitely recommend this hotel,"When we arrived at the Hotel, staff was really helpful, happy and talkative, we were very much welcomed, very clean hotel and friendly, walking distance from shops and bars, would definitely stay in this hotel again.  ",5,2020,02,17
219,Modern hotel in Dublin city,"Recently stayed in one of the Club King rooms at The Address hotel. Very modern and high tech design throughout. The room was clean and spacious, and despite being close to Connolly train station, it was also very quiet. Really pleased with the Club Lounge access, especially in the evening time when wine & canap√©s are being served. Great atmosphere overall and would definitely stay again.",5,2020,02,17
219,Building work,"Stayed here for 3 nights in February, after originally booking into a premium room at the North Star Hotel (in the same building). 

It is worth mentioning that the North Star side is having extensive building work to add an additional 2 floors of rooms. Regardless of what side of the building you are on you will hear excessive building works every week day. After complaining Reception advised the work starts at 9 and ends around 3 - to clarify the work starts at 07:30. 

Officially the hotel are not advertising this, nor are they telling you on reception that they have work going on. I complained and we were upgraded to the Address with the lounge access. 

The room was nice with touch controls for lighting and curtains, however some of the lighting in the room wasn‚Äôt working (this was raised to the housekeeping attendant but was never fixed during our stay). 

The lounge is an added bonus but I can not recommend this hotel in its current form, the rooms are lovely but the soundproofing is so very poor that you will be woken by building work. ",3,2020,02,17
219,"Lovely hotel, great breakfast","Such a nice hotel, extremely clean, modern. Great courtesy club room where we had swipe access to for cookies,coffee etc . Great Buffett brekfast. Such nice staff at reception . Love the ambiance of the lobby area.",4,2020,02,12
219,Birthday Trip,"Visited this weekend with friends for my 30th bday! The hotel was a surprise from my husband and he chose well! Excellent trendy hotel with all the mod cons I love in a hotel, really clean and modern rooms. Loved the motion sensor lights on the bed side tables and the electric curtains! I even got chocolates and a bday card in my room! Would recommend to anyone staying in a dublin for a nice hotel just a short distance to temple bar.",5,2020,02,11
219,Short 2 day stay,We stayed here whilst visiting Dublin on my son's stag do but unlike the rest who stayed Air B&B I opted for a hotel and I wasn't disappointed as this hotel was really good. The staff couldn't do enough for me wether giving me advice or assisting me with my stay. I only had the chance to have breakfast once but the one I had was excellent although buffet style the food was super hot and the range was large one piece of advice is pre order and pay for this as you get it at a discounted price. I have stayed at many hotels over my time and this one rates up there with the best. I am not sure wether it would be cheaper if I travelled at a different time as it was on the weekend of the Ireland v Wales 6 nations rugby.,5,2020,02,11
219,Night away in Dublin with friends to attend Bord Gais,"Great nights accommodation in Dublin city. Convenient to Luas so Bord Gais, 3 arena and city centre close by.
Hotel menu very good. Lovely lunch and dinner. Rooms clean. Beds ok but I am used to a high standard orthopaedic mattress. Ok for 1 night. 
TV in room lovely and large. Shower good. Has safe and ironing board and iron in room. Ana in reception and Keith in the bar/lounge very helpful. Will stay again. ",4,2020,02,10
219,Excellent hotel,"We had a issue when we arrived the staff sorted it and upgraded us to a premier room. 
Very clean and tidy and very friendly staff. 

We Would stay here again highly recommended. 

The issue we had was there was building works and Temporary generator outside our window staff sorted straight away and moved us and up graded us. üëçüëçüëç",5,2020,02,09
219,Great experience at the North Star.,We stayed for one night in the North Star. We were very impressed with the quality of the service we received. The staff were very professional. We were looked after so well. The room was lovely. The breakfast was great. Loads of choice. Can't wait to stay there again,5,2020,02,09
219,Beautiful boutique hotel!,"We had originally booked our stay at the North Star hotel for two nights for my partners birthday, and on arrival we were upgraded to the new wing of the hotel The Address. The room was so modern and stylish, big bathroom, big and very comfortable bed, and so spacious. Was so impressed too as they provided us with chocolates and a birthday card for my partner in the room on arrival - such a lovely touch!! In our upgrade too we were given access to the lounge which served a continental breakfast (breakfast wasn‚Äôt included in our original price so this was much appreciated) and in the evenings wine and refreshments!

The hotel is a 10mins walk to O‚ÄôConnell St, and is in walking distance to temple bar - we just took a taxi as my shoes on the Friday night were not made for a walk...but was only about ‚Ç¨6, not bad for Dublin since it‚Äôs supposedly expensive! 

On the Saturday night we were quite late back to the hotel and hadn‚Äôt made any dinner reservations, so were lucky to have dinner in the hotel restaurant McGettigans. The food was unbelievable, and since coming home have recommended the restaurant to friends who are heading down in a few weeks.

Will absolutely stay here again on any future trips to Dublin, the whole experience was perfect from start to finish!",5,2020,02,09
219,"Fantastic new rooms, great customer service ","I stayed at the Address for a total of 10 nights. I was in one of the new rooms and what a revelation it was. Everything was operated by touch panels, even the remote opening and closing of the curtains. The room was sumptuous and quiet, although I could still hear the DART trundle past, but that is unavoidable in this part of town. The private members lounge was well kitted out, and every evening free wine and nibbles were served for an hour. There was also a complimentary continental breakfast available in the same room. I had a minor issue with the room and headed to reception in search of help. Darius was professional,  friendly and helpful and resolved my issue quickly and without fuss. Excellent customer service! I will definitely be back to this wonderful hotel!",5,2020,02,07

219,Weekend break,Rooms were very comfortable and the food was excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was very well placed for the city centre and the local tourist attractions and we were able to walk to most places of interest.,5,2020,02,04
219,Disappointed with this stay......,"Booked the hotel based on reviews. 
Notified the hotel we was coming for our 1st wedding anniversary as we visit Dublin a few times a year.
We was excited to stop at hotel. On arrival and entering our room we had a box of 5 chocolates and a little card. Very disappointed that‚Äôs all they put in for us. We had to turn air con off as very noisy and opened window which we had to close as to noisy outside. Not how I thought we would spend our special time at hotel. Lower star hotels would of made it more romantic for us and will be stopping else where when we visit again this year as don‚Äôt think the hotel was interested we choose them to make our 1st year married special... very disappointed is an understatement... Hotel itself was nice and room was clean.",2,2020,02,03
219,Best hotel and staff in town!!!,"Excellent place!!! Really worth the time spent there!

Staff was gracious and polite, treating us like family!

Super well located place, walking distance from the main attractions (such as temple bar, trinity college, etc)",5,2020,02,03

219,Amazing hotel,"Everything was great from start to finish and a nice clean hotel with nice staff. The room was a great size, also done a free wine on top floor and cheese between 6:30 and 7:30 which was really nice and a extra bonus we didn‚Äôt know about ",5,2020,01,31
219,Another stop over in Dublin,"Lost count of my stays in the North Star Hotel Dublin
But it‚Äôs the first place I look to book each time I go back  
Friendly staff 
Good service 
Nice food (although I would like them to change the menu now and again) 
Other than that a thumbs up from me ",4,2020,01,29
219,Gorgeous hotel,"Can‚Äôt fault the hotel at all, the rooms are spotless and beds so comfy, the tv has plenty of channels to choose from, a touch pad which controlled all lights and even opened the curtains! The staff are also amazing and helped with absolutely anything we needed, really welcoming nothing was too much to ask.

The 747 airport link drops you off just round the corner, if you cross the road from the hotel there‚Äôs also the 27 bus stop which takes you through the centre of Dublin, only 2 euro per person otherwise it‚Äôs a 30 minute walk:)",5,2020,01,27
219,Gorgeous hotel,Fabulous hotel. Friendly staff. Great location. Sensor lights in the bedroom under the locker. Shower could be stronger but that's my only complaint. Kids loved the pancakes at breakfast! Close to croke park. ,5,2020,01,27
219,Weekend ,Can not fault this hotel .it is spotlessly clean.  And very central .rooms are immaculate really comfortable bed . Would highly recommend although the train station is directly opposite. We had no concern with train noise .as other people had mentioned .please do not let this put you off in any way ,5,2020,01,27
219,Birthday Trip,"Stayed here for a few nights before Christmas for my wife‚Äôs birthday. 

The airlink bus 147 drops you off just around the corner from the hotel so didn‚Äôt take too long to walk to. 

Hotel itself was really nice, clean, modern and the staff were great. 

We had breakfast in the hotel both mornings and it was phenomenal. The price was incredibly reasonable compared to what is available at other cafes in the area. 

Would definitely stay here again if we return to Dublin",5,2020,01,25
219,Excellent accommodation,"I slept like a dream and will most definitely recommend the hotel to friends and colleagues. It is very well situated, clean and the service is excellent. The bed was extremely comfortable and luxurious. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2020,01,24
219,Perfect hotel for the convience and ease in exploring Dublin.,"The hotel accommodated me for 3 nights. In a prime location, it meant I could easily come back and crash after a long day of exploring Dublin. 
The bar service in the hotel was superb, quick and friendly. The food was fabulous too. 
The layout of the hotel was small but practical (over luxurious), if you are looking for a quick-stop hotel, at a good price (i.e. if you want to spend more time outside than inside), this is the best place for that. 

My only criticisms for this hotel was:
The morning was quite noisy from the construction outside (after 10am), which wasn't really a problem because I was up early most the time.
 If you a women with long hair (like myself), I wold recommend taking better shampoo and a stronger hairdryer. 
Finally, the motion censored lights were great until you move too much at night and the lights come on (and I wiggle a lot at night). So I covered the lights under the bedside table with pillows and this seemed to work. 
Thank you North Star Hotel and it's staff for out stay, hence the 5-star review. HTH.",5,2020,01,22
219,Very decent option at a good price,"I stayed here for one night on a business trip so that I could get to Croke Park for a conference, about 20 minutes walk away. This is a nice hotel and very keenly priced compared to other Dublin hotels. The staff were friendly and efficient at check in and check out. The room is very modern, with panels on the walls to control lights and heating. You can also do this through the tv. There‚Äôs a small night light which flicks on automatically if you have to get up in the night, which is a good touch. It goes off again soon after. The train station opposite didn‚Äôt disturb my sleep in any way. The rooms are quite far away from the tracks, at the back of the building. A very solid option. ",4,2020,01,22
219,Family trip to Ireland,"Friendly, nice, clean, quaint hotel.  Food was good. Near restaurants, walkable to city. Only thing was parking not available on site had a about a 5/10 min walk to a public lot. But would stay again..",5,2020,01,22

219,Best bed ever and VIP service!,"The access to the club lounge really made our trip. Lovely rooftop views and permanent amenities including continental breakfast and wine and nibbles in the evening!

The concierge was so helpful with travel advice and ticket deals and also storing our luggage on arrival and departure! Would definitely stay here again!",5,2020,01,21
219,Excellent,"This hotel is beyond beautiful. It looks gorgeous, smells gorgeous, everything is first class and the staff could not be more helpful.

Our room was in The Address and was perfect, remote control for TV controlled lights in room and when you got out of bed when room was dark lights around skirting board came on...very cool!
We ate in McGettigan‚Äôs and food was great. I had chicken and my partner had steak. No complaints from either of us and clean plates all round. Staff in restaurant were great and special shout out to David who never let my gin glass go empty!
This hotel has come on leaps and bounds I past few years the staff are an absolute credit to hotel and ensure your stay is everything you need it to be. You would be hard pressed to get such good value for money and service elsewhere in Dublin City Centre",5,2020,01,19

219,Pleasant surprise,Really enjoyed my stay st The North Star. I had chosen the hotel just for its excellent location right by the Luas and Connolley Station.  Didn't realise just how nice the hotel was hidden away the other side of the railway line. I will definitely be going back,5,2020,01,14
219,Parlour Cafe in The North Star Hotel,"I decided to host my business meeting this morning in The North Star Hotel. I must say I was very impressed with the excellent Querzia provided in the Parlour Cafe. Querzia went beyond the normal standard customer experience we are use to.

219,"Great staff, handy location","went here with 2 friends. 2 of us had tapas stype platter and the other had burger. food was lovely. That tapas platter is fantastic idea. little bit of eveything. chicken wings teeny bit dry but completely made up for by the lovely macaroons. I dont usually like them. But they were so juicy and tasty. i would get them again. The real bonus in this place is the staff. We were greeted by a guy (his name escapes me) in a waist coat who was just so helpful and friendly. Lovely decor, chilled vibe, brilliant location (acessible by diesel, DART, bus) and relaxed. thanks for looking after us so well. I will be back ",5,2020,01,11

219,Fantastic hotel for business travellers,"A real pleasure to stay at Northstar: beginning with their #1 grade staff, they will attend any request to make your life easier and help you with anything you need. The rooms are ample and they do have a big bureau to work  with a good internet connection. Superb ribeye steaks in the restaurant. ",5,2020,01,10
219,Excellent hotel!,"We went here for a long weekend and it was amazing. We stayed in the Address rooms which were spacious, comfy and luxurious. Staff were very friendly and helpful and a special mention has to go to ‚ÄúIrish David‚Äù the barman. It‚Äôs worth going up to the Club Lounge for wine and nibbles at 6.30 as it‚Äôs a chance to meet other guests and take in the view from the rooftop deck. The hotel is ideally situated and only a 15 minute walk from centre. I have no complaints about this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it. We will definitely be back next time we‚Äôre in Dublin. Very happy customers :)",5,2020,01,09
219,Fantastic Dublin Experience,"This was our first visit to Dublin and to Ireland. We selected The Address on account of its excellent location. And enjoyed the convenience of the location thoroughly.

But discovered many more luxury facets to this hotel. Beginning with the rooms themselves - super comfortable and super chic. With great leather furniture.

And the great restaurant on the ground floor. Easily one of the best food experiences in Dublin. Especially the Jacobs Rack for meat lovers.

And the super breakfast. Very welcoming, lots of choices, great food quality and excellent service.

And the roof top lounge. An excellent place to read a book, sip a coffee, mull over a glass of wine or have a quick snack.

Then there‚Äôs the happy hour at sunset when the brilliant Stephen takes charge of the lounge and converts it into a buzzing community!

We strongly recommend The Address for an excellent Dublin experience...

219,New Years Eve,"Stayed here on new years eve. Really nice modern hotel, very comfortable rooms and great service. Great location across from the train station and walking distance to loads. The complimentary wine and cheese on the roof terrace is a nice added bonus! ",4,2020,01,07
219,NYE in Dublin,"A group of 6 stayed at the North Star Hotel for 2 nights over New Years Eve. The hotel was in a perfect location with a 15 min walk to the temple bar area of the city. There is also a taxi rank opposite the hotel and the bus station is a 10 min walk away. 

Both rooms (family room and a double) were clean and spacious however the building works going on outside woke us up around 8am. 

Would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",4,2020,01,06
219,great hotel,"my partner and I stayed in this hotel, all the staff were lovely, only across the road from the station and a short walk away from the shops and bars. There was also complementary wine and cheese which was great, the member of staff irish dave was lovely and very knowledgeable.",5,2020,01,05
219,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here over new year and happened to be sick for most of the holiday. The staff couldn't have been more helpful providing us with any extra things we needed during our stay. The hotel was beautiful and would definitely recommend ordering the seafood chowder

219,Fantastic stay for NYE,"Stayed at the North Star Hotel with 2 other friends for NYE and had a wonderful stay! I have to thank the staff for making the stay so pleasant, everyone from the waiting staff to the people on the desk were so friendly. The hotel was gorgeous and we hope to return ! Hotel was about a 15/20 minute walk to temple bar area but this allowed us to see more of Dublin we feel. Thank you for a great stay :)",5,2020,01,04

219,NYE - my second visit ,"Second visit to the hotel. The new part of the hotel ( address) is fantastic. 

Rooms are big and spacious so clean. The technology in the upgraded rooms is fantastic. 
As soon as you walk into the hotel it‚Äôs clean smells amazing! 

Staff are so friendly. I will be returning. 

Also the complimentary wine from 630pm until 730pm in the bar on 7th floor is such an amazing touch. 

I will be returning for a third time. ",5,2020,01,01
219,Stunning.,"Myself and my husband have returned from our stay at the North Star hotel.This hotel is first class from check in to check out.This hotel offers a friendly welcome. The premier rooms are stunning.They serve first class food in Mc Gettigans onsite restaurant.The hotel has beautiful decor and sophisticated ambiance throughout.

Restaurant was very good. Food was great quality and the staff were great.",5,2019,12,25
219,Excellent Dublin Location,Stayed in the NorthStar and what a location. Opposite Connolly Train Station. 100 metres from Bus Aras. Right on the Luas line.. And fabulous break. I‚Äôll be back. That‚Äôs for sure. Newly refurb is excellent too. Great bar. Great food.. And brilliant value for money too,5,2019,12,22
219,What a great hotel,"Loved staying her albeit for just 2 nights.  They have obviously thought hard about what visitors really want when staying, from flannels in the bathroom, low lights if you need a quick visit to the toilet in the night but do not want to disturb anyone, a great breakfast bar and really comfortable beds.  A delight to stay here.
Also Red Line tram was just round the corner and it toook me everywhere I needed to go.",5,2019,12,19
219,Lovely Christmas city break,"The North Star Hotel is a lovely central boutique hotel. The location is fantastic as it is just a walk away from O‚ÄôConnell Street, Grafton Street and Temple Bar (must-see places in Dublin!) and just opposite Connolly station. The hotel itself is modern, homey and chic and the festive decorations were the cherry on top! The staff was lovely and helpful, particularly Gabby at reception who was very kind and friendly - nothing was a bother or inconvenience to them. They kindly assisted in printing our boarding passes. We also used the free luggage storage on our last day whilst we spent the day sightseeing and exploring. Our room was clean and beautifully decorated and the lobby smelt fantastic as soon as you entered! A lovely stay overall and I definitely recommend the North Star!",5,2019,12,17
219,The one to beat in Dublin,"This is my 6th time in Dublin, previously staying with friends and twice at the Temple bar hotel.
We fancied staying a little further out of the strip due to prices and found the North Star. The hotel is absolutely fabulous in every way. 
We had a very early flight meaning that we went over to the hotel to drop our bags off, as check in wasn‚Äôt until 2pm. To our delight we could check in early, no extra charge and we had been upgraded to the newly renovated area of the hotel.
We were shown to our room, explained to about the new tech in the room and left to relax.
Couldn‚Äôt find one complaint, the rooms were clean, amazingly decorated and the added bonus of pressing a button to open the curtains just made it!
Fantastic stay overall and will 100% be back next year!! ",5,2019,12,16
219,Lovely modern comfortable hotel with excellent staff,"The North Star hotel is excellent,top class customer service from the receptionist Isabella,lovely lady who had a great sense of humour and her customer service was 10/10
The hotel is very modern and very homely 
An excellent nights sleep so 10/10 for the bed,all the staff are extremely helpful and welcoming and the hotel is in an excellent location!
If I am in Dublin again I will be booking here ",5,2019,12,15
219,Lovely remodelled hotel,"The stay was great ,only down for three days but will be back again,the rooms are lovely and you are so handy to the centre of Dublin ,we got of the train and Connolly street station and the hotel is literally in front of you,the place is spotless and the staff are so friendly and pleasant ,this makes for an enjoyable time,the food in the restaurant is lovely and there is always deals on each night,we just got changed the second night and went back down to the restart ax the meal the night before was superb,we will be back again in the spring so I would advise you to stay here very pleasant,thankyou to al, the staff for being so friendly",5,2019,12,13
219,Rude and unhelpful staff! ,"Visited for a weekend on 22nd November for my husbands 30th birthday. Check in was awful, we were overcharged, not provided with any information and wrongly told we didn‚Äôt have breakfast with our booking. When this was mentioned the staff member just tutted at us - no apology given. 
The hotel itself is lovely and our room was nice enough but we hardly spent any time in it and certainly not worth the money. 
The staff were very unhelpful, my husband asked about where to get the bus from and the reception staff just looked up from the reception desk and shrugged at him. He felt like he was inconveniencing her! The concierge from another hotel actually helped him and was super friendly - something that this hotels staff could learn! 
Overall we would not return to this hotel nor would we recommend it. Do not know what staff previous reviewers have come into contact with but certainly not the staff we had dealings with. Very disappointed. ",2,2019,12,11
219,Fabulous Hotel,"Great food, ideal location, very efficient friendly staff. Conveniently located across from Connolly train station and near to Dublin‚Äôs main bus terminal Busarus. Linda in reservations could not have been more helpful and Orlaith looking after us dining was just fantastic. ",5,2019,12,11
219,Wedding Anniversary.,Lovely central hotel. All good. Sean in bar very friendly and make you feel like home from home. Food very tasty. Room very spacious. Drink very expensive. Breakfast good. Reception staff helpful. Geraldine & Jerome.,4,2019,12,11

Clean rooms also. ",5,2019,12,10
219,Ideal City Centre Boutique Hotel,"We love this hotel.. It has everything.. Perfect location, perfect friendly staff, comfortable rooms, lovely bar / dining areas.

Sean in the bar is one friendly guy and full of local knowledge. 

Breakfast room is the only slight disappointment.. Down in the basement.. It used to be in the front bar area. Also tried the cornflakes and let's just say they definitely were not a well known brand so I had Wheetabix instead! ",5,2019,12,10
219,Christmas family trip,"We had a family room 2 double beds - this is an amazing hotel - close to shops 
Staff in the hotel were so helpful & polite üëèand rooms were so clean and comfortable- I cannot fault anything about this stay . And really good value which helps when your Christmas shopping. We will definitely be back ",5,2019,12,09
219,Very poor service!!!!,"Very poor experience with a member of staff

I stayed at this hotel from Dec 5th to Dec 7th. I had an encounter with a member of staff in the lift that can only be described as racist.

He gave the impression that I do not belong at the hotel (maybe due to the colour of my skin) , hence I should not be going to the rooms.
If this is not the case then he thinks that I am an idiot and do not know where I am going.
Very poor service.
The guys at check-in and other hotel staff were brilliant though so it may be a case of one bad apple",1,2019,12,09
219,Christmas girlie break,This is my second stay in the North Star hotel and it was fantastic! The rooms are excellent and very quiet. The staff are amazing especially in the bar/restaurant we had the best weekend üòç I‚Äôll be back again in March 2020.,5,2019,12,09
219,Beautiful hotel with amazing service,My friend and I booked this hotel through Great Value Vacations as a package deal with airfare over Thanksgiving. We are so incredibliy happy with our vacation and stay at this hotel. It is beautiful! The staff is so friendly and accommodating and the hotel restaurant is delicious.,5,2019,12,08
219,Lovely Christmas Getaway,We have stayed here afew times as the hotel is so central & handy for the city. However this was our 1st time staying with our 2 small kids. The food in the hotel is fab so we decided last minute to eat in the restaurant however our 1yr old had different ideas üôàüôàüòÇüòÇ she literally had a meltdown in the restaurant.. and would not settle..screaming the place down. We were mortified!! But the hostess Elizabeth was just so lovly and helpful and understanding to us..onlg for her. She kept our 4 yr old company & kept an eye on her when we were out in the hall trying to settle the baby & then she got all our food delivered up to the room for us which was great. Her kindness & compassion meant alot.. my 4yr old even commented the next day wasn't that lady so lovly lasnite üòÇüòÇ anyways we really appreciated it & we def will be returning.. (hopefully with a happier babyüòÇüòÇ),5,2019,12,08

219,Trip to Dublin review,"Overall, lovely hotel, very modern facilities and lovely staff especially barman Sean who is a pure gent.
Good food too and good choice and selection of breakfast options.
All areas of hotel were clean and well serviced ",4,2019,12,06
219,Amazing hotel,"The atmosphere of the hotel is so relaxed and decor is stunning. Very modern hotel, room have excellent facilities and extremely clean. We were in Dublin for a concert so it was perfect location for the concert and to get some shopping in. ",5,2019,12,03
219,North star Hotel,"Lovely, clean and modern. Restaurant and bar, lobby looked lovely. Didn't eat there becuase we felt slightly overdressed. Room service option was very comprehensive. Had room ready when we arrived at 11,didnt have to wait which was great. ",5,2019,12,02
219,Beautiful and so relaxing!,My daughter and I came to Dublin for a pre Christmas shopping trip and stayed forin North Star for one night and really enjoyed our stay. We were made very welcome by all the staff and our room was so comfortable and spotless. The added bonus of being so close to the train station and a convenient walk to the city centre.  Thank you so much! ,5,2019,12,02
219,Central Dublin,So conveniently situated opposite  Connolly Station and within easy walking distance for sightseeing and shopping. Great addition of a cafe for lighter options if a full breakfast isn't your preference ,4,2019,12,02
219,Very poor staff experience,"This was our second time staying at the Address. We booked the Christmas package online, which included full Irish breakfast. We went down for breakfast and we're told that we didn't book breakfast. I said that we did and explained the package booked. The lady rang reception and then told us again that we booked a regular room without breakfast. I offered to show her the booking but she didn't want to see it, waving us off to go upstairs to reception. 

At reception we were greeted by a gentleman who told us that we didn't book breakfast and we were wrong. He said he told us already (even though we hadn't spoken to him about it!). Eventually he was willing to see our booking and said there was an issue with their system. 

After going back down to breakfast, a different lady said ""oh so you didn't have it booked?"". All three staff members assumed we were the ones wrong, implying we were lying, while on all occasions in front of many people, leaving us both mortified and annoyed afterwards. 

Note to staff management, instead of assuming your guests are liars, maybe apologize for the confusion and look at their booking. Very poor staff responses, which put a really bad finish to an otherwise okay stay.",3,2019,12,01
219,Delightful,"Most comfortable bed.Everything one could want in the room,loved the coffee maker. Use of penthouse lounge an added bonus.Resteraunt on site was excellent.Most helpful staff.Lovely decor,liked the security,with access to hotel rooms and lifts was by keycard.
",5,2019,11,29
219,Excellent stay,"Great location next to Luas tram and easy walk into city centre. Very nice and pleasant check in staff, coffee machine in room and breakfast from 7am + was top quality. A very 'easy' stay for the business person!",5,2019,11,28
219,Back again,"After an initial mix up, not who‚Äôs fault booking agent but
I‚Äôve got to say, the front desk were really helpful, room upgraded and breakfast 
sorted in no time at all 
This Hotel is well worth a visit, just a short walk in to the city only takes 10 minutes or just jump on the tram",5,2019,11,27
219,Excellent,Excellent. Very clean. Food and staff were lovely. Very centrally located. Really atmospheric with tasteful Christmas decorations and scents! Staff member didn't know where the Bord Gais Theatre was when asked!,5,2019,11,26
219,Weekend with friends,"The hotel was very nice and comfortable breakfast could be a bit cheaper ,it‚Äôs a great location just across the road from the train station.the staff were very nice and helpful. Would definitely stay there again ",4,2019,11,25
219,Wonderful weekend at the Address Hotel,"My mum and I were on a shopping weekend in Dublin. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, everything was outstanding. Lovely atmosphere and really friendly staff at reception and we were upgraded (for no reason apparently) and given complementary breakfast and wine and cheese in the evenings in a private club lounge, both of which were fab. Our room was really nice too - attention to detail, spotlessly clean and super comfortable.  A nespresso machine in the room too was a bonus!  Great wifi everywhere!  In every sense, a truly wonderful hotel and will absolutely stay there again when next in Dublin. ",5,2019,11,25
219,Two night stay,"Waiting at reception for a while.
Unclear where breakfast was actually served in the hotel, had to ask a very sharp receptionist a couple of times.
Tabes reserved at breakfast but no-one sat there for the 90mins we were there - friends had to sit separately.
Other than those minor points, the stay was great. Fab location and very comfy beds. Would stay again.",4,2019,11,24
219,Excellent Hotel,"Great hotel in a good location of Dublin within good walking distance of many things to do and places to eat and/or drink. The service was top notch as well! Their full Irish Breakfast is amazing! Although the rooms are on the smaller end, they are clean and contain a fridge, closet, and safe. We would definitely stay at the North Star Hotel again!",5,2019,11,23
219,Excellent mid week break,I stayed at this hotel some years ago and it has modernised since my last visit. Lovely clean rooms good food especially in the main restaurant and friendly and efficient service. The main reason for picking this hotel is because of its proximity to Bus and Rail stations and it is within easy walking distance of the main shopping and entertainment areas. I'll definitely be back here.  ,5,2019,11,23
219,"Noise, Noise and More Noise","You want noise? Stay here. You will get the metal screeching from the trains plus as an added bonus, drills, pounding on metal so forceful that you can stand in your room and feel the shaking through your feet. I asked for a room change and all they did was put my up one floor. Negligible difference in noise and vibration. The front desk seemed to think it was fine because it would stop at suppertime.

Avoid North Star until the construction is complete.",1,2019,11,21
219,Great hotel,"Excellent stay. Delicious breakfast. Heating didn‚Äôt work and immediately moved and upgraded to another room.
Perfectly situated in the middle of the town. Everyone friendly and helpful . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,11,20
219,It was a construction site!,"What a disappointment this hotel was. Stayed here pre and post Globus tour.  Check in was a disaster, we waited 1.5 hours for our room to be ready. We think we were actually forgotten by reception staff, even though we were sitting right in front of them. Once in our room we were met with drilling and banging from above, due to construction work. 

The sign near the lift said that the building works would operate between 10.00am to 5.00pm.  Not true.  On every morning that we were there, the drilling and clanging started from 7.30am onwards.   We discussed this with management on our last day there, and he said that they had changed the signs to say that building would begin at 9.00am.  Sorry sir, but the two signs on level five said 10.00am.  He also informed me that they didn‚Äôt really have any control over the builders. What a joke.  I think guests should be offered a discount during building works and suggested this to him, but of course he wasn‚Äôt going to offer that.

One lift didn‚Äôt work and the other one had a mind of its own.  We spent a lot of time going up and down in that lift and only once in our five day stay did the lift actually get to the basement for breakfast. I have a knee injury and was not impressed that I had to go up and down two flights of stairs for breakfast.

Once we started our Globus tour, EVERY hotel we stayed in had a terrific check in, speedy and with no fuss. We got back to this hotel for our final night and check in was a disaster again. Reception staff fumbled with room cards, and seemed quite frazzled by the whole thing. We found most of the reception staff quite unwelcoming.

Would not recommend this hotel. Reception staff need an update in customer service, and if you really need to stay there, check that construction has finished.  

",2,2019,11,19
219,Great,"Lovely hotel staff very friendly good location. The only dissappointment was the cafe coffee hot chocolate etc not very hot, one of the cakes was very dry. We should have said something at the time as I feel they would have sorted it.  ",5,2019,11,18
219,Fantastic Hotel,Fortunate enough to travel most months of the year and this place was beautiful... Well done to the management and staff ..... Just the train to get use to .... food was superb....even though work was in progress it was kept well..,5,2019,11,18
219,Excellent stay,"We have just arrived home after 3 nights here with another couple..
The hotel is beautiful, beds are massive and the rooms are kept clean..We was on the front of the hotel overlooking the busy street, the noise wasn't bad unless you opened a window..the staff are all friendly.
The location is idea is a 10 min walk to The temple bar, 30 min walk to The Guinness factory.. lots of eateries by the hotel so you have plenty of choice for food.. coach from airport was 12euros return- bargain and it took 20 mins 
Only moan is maybe put breakfast in with price of room.
Overall I would stay here again and recommend it too.
Thanks for my first visit to Dublin 
Forgot to say it's right opposite the train station too",5,2019,11,17
219,Ongoing Construction & Noisy,"When I arrived at the North Star Hotel, I had just passed through an area where the bus terminal and train station were located. When I finally found the Hotel, I approached the front desk clerk in the lobby and heard a roaring sound of a train passing overhead.  Apparently, the hotel is situated just below an overhead train that runs from 7 am - 11 pm.  When I arrived at my room, which was on the first floor, I opened my drapes to view a large scaffolding right in front of me; there was NO VIEW.  They informed me that construction would begin at 9:00 am, which actually began at 8:00 am. I was just glad that I had earplugs and was only there for 4 nights.  This was the hotel my travel agent booked; since I would not have stayed here otherwise. I travel a lot on business and pleasure and avoid hotels under construction due to the noise and smell.  Also, this was located closer to the outside of the city centre, not as central as you would expect.  Others may enjoy staying here, but I would not stay here again or recommend it to any of my family or friends.",2,2019,11,17
219,Don't upgrade,"Thanks to a Lufthansa strike I had to scramble for a last minute hotel booking in Dublin. Looking at the limited range of options, I went with the North Star. I'll start with the positives: the reception is very well run, the front of the house is modern and tidy. 
However, I decided to go for the upgrade to the club room for my two night stay, The clyb room itself was fine, if small. Great bathroom, nice King bed with too many cushions (it's a hotel not a residence). TV had all sorts of channels, but not BBC News. Wifi speed was OK--adequate. But the club ""lounge"", which was supposed to include snacks throughout the day: in fact, there was a tray of biscuits and an automatic espresso machine. I was unable to eat ‚Ç¨30 of biscuits a day--the cost of the upgrade. 
The room was serviced each day, though they weren't super thorough: some garbage wasn't emptied, for example. And there was only one working elevator.",3,2019,11,16
219,Improvements needed,"Stayed at this hotel for one night only for my mums 55th birthday. I appreciate the small gestures located inside our hotel room It was a lovely touch. When we arrived we were told that we had been upgraded which was great and we really appreciated this, however when we arrived at our room we realised that our room was located in the centre of construction work that is clearly taking place at the moment, as soon as we walked through the door we were greeted by hammer sounds banging and very extreme noise which was not ideal as I had payed money to stay here. Disappointing that before and during our arrival we were not informed of any construction work that was taking place. 

The ladies on the front desk were all polite, professional  and very helpful however some of the male staff me and my mum found to be quite rude and not the most welcoming. This was a shame and let the hotel down massively. Location was good and beds were clean and comfy however definitely needs improvement, customer service wise.",2,2019,11,16
219,Nice Hotel,"Very comfortable, clean rooms and public areas. The Club Lounge is very limited in breakfast items and evening snacks compared to other lounges we have visited. Luke (attendant at the Lounge) and Kieran at Concierge were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is close to Henry Street Shopping but a 20 min walk from Grafton and Temple Bar areas, but it is a scenic one. The gym is also adequate to keep up your routine.  ",5,2019,11,13
219,Great location,Spent 2 days at the hotel which is an upscale atmosphere. The lobby and restaurants are attractive. Our room was very comfortable and spotless. It didn‚Äôt have a view. The only negative was the construction noise next door. I heard other people complained about the train noise near their room. A train line does go over the lobby. The breakfasts in the Cellar and the Parlor were great. I didn‚Äôt get to try dinner. My son liked the bar. The hotel was ideal for us since we were able to walk all over Dublin.,4,2019,11,12
219,Fantastic,"The hotel is great, as are the staff. Our room was clean and spacious. The bed was super comfy and the shower was good too. We had a few drinks in the bar, which is really nice. Close to Temple Bar area, but it did mean getting the tram, as was too far for us to walk. However, the tram was so easy and for ‚Ç¨7.30 you can get an all day Flexi ticket, so you can travel all over Dublin on the tram. We was a short walk away from The Famine Memorial too.

Would definitely stay here again",4,2019,11,12
219,Louisiana visits Dublin,"Front desk personnel very friendly and helpful. Convenient to all public transportation. Maybe put top sheets on the beds rather than having to use that heavy comforter for cover at night... It gets toooo hot under there. Maybe include the breakfast with the packages as our other hotels did on this trip.
 ",4,2019,11,11
219,Very disappointing,"This was my 2nd stay at the north star. I specifically booked the room I had on my first stay which they said was fine. Upon arrival they told me there was construction going on in all the balcony rooms and that I have been ""upgraded"". The room they gave me was the exact same as the room previous minus the balcony which is the only reason I wanted the room I booked. It was also on the other side of the building right beside the train track so i spent the morning not sleeping listening to the loud train go by. In no way was this an upgrade from what i booked. On the booking website it said check out until 12 and they start ringing the room at half 11 telling us that check out is at half 11 when the website says otherwise. If I knew I wasnt getting the room i booked I would I asked for a much cheaper room instead I had to pay 175 euro to be kept up all night. What a horrible experience. I do not recommend staying here. They do not care about happy customers.",1,2019,11,10
219,Lovely hotel great location,"Lovely hotel we stayed for a concert in the 3 Arena and it's an ideal location. Great staff, lovely rooms and great breakfast.  The only negative was the restaurant,  the food wasn't great , I would definitely stay again but would not eat at the restaurant.  ",4,2019,11,09
219,Love the Hotel!,"Stayed here for 4 nights with friends and their families.   Check in was a breeze. Shout out to Ysabelle who was very friendly and accommodating. Room is always cleaned daily.  After a tiring day of touring Dublin and the nearby towns, it is always nice to come to a clean room, with well-made beds, fresh towels and toiletries. People are very friendly and attentive. 

We had problems with our room though - first, the hot water was not working on our 2nd day, we called the reception to fix it, but unfortunately, the maintenance crew wasn't around anymore. We were offered to use the Gym or Swedish Sauna instead, but we find it inconvenient to go there with our stuff.  2nd, the airconditioning was not working, but they had the maintenance fix it. But anyway, we enjoyed our stay. 

Location is ideal as well - restaurants and shops are just a few minutes walking distance. Dublin metro station is just right infront. 

We had a great time, but I guess we spent too little time in Dublin. We will definitely stay at North Star again should we decide to come back to Dublin. 

",4,2019,11,09
219,Concert trip,"Hotel is very centrally located,with close by access to safe parking for only‚Ç¨9 for 24 hours. Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. Excellent breakfast. Room was very comfortable. Perfect location for a walk or Lukas ride to the 3 Arena for concerts.",5,2019,11,05
219,"Good location for train, Airlink and walk to bus station.",The nicest hotel we stayed in while a week in Ireland. After checking in we had tea and scones in the cafe. Another evening we enjoyed dinner in their restaurant. Everything that was delivered to folks around us looked and smelled fantastic. Our meals were well prepared and ample serving. Drinks were creative and tasty. Rooms were clean as was the bath area.,5,2019,11,04
219,Top Class,"Great Location;great staff, great food, 
stayed two nights and could not fault this hotel, from the minute you meet the friendly staff at the reecption untill to receive the amazing food and top class service at the resturant
we will always come again if there is availabity ",5,2019,11,04
219,Magnific Hotel,"The hotel has a magnific atmosphere, along with kindness and attention to the people.

The room is very comfortable, and has all the items that you need: body cream included!

Its position is very strategic to reach all the Dublin's attractions.",4,2019,11,04
219,"Marvellous venue for shopping, concerts","Stayed here as it was very convenient to Connolly st, luas line and to the point 3arena where we attended a concert. Staff were very helpful in directions as we had not stayed in Dublin before.  Beautiful shops within 5 min walking distance would definitely stay here again",5,2019,11,03
219,In town for Cher,"Stayed at this lovely quirky hotel , on Saturday past, I thought it was an old converted train station, but one of the staff told me it was an old coach house, train station is across the road. The place is spotless,staff very friendly( especially the John the security man) and we had food in the restaurant which was excellent. It's only around the corner from the Luas which took us to the 3 arena to see Cher. The Dublin bus station is also a short walk which we came from. Also a short walk to city centre. Very well situated. Would definitely return. ",5,2019,11,03
219,Fantastic,"Staff were so helpful and friendly, hotel was stunning. I would highly recommend this amazing hotel. Central location, lots of places to see within walking distance. Shops and food places nearby, hotel bar was lovely fantastic service and cocktails.",5,2019,11,01
219,Excellent Facilities ,"I was on Business trip in Dublin and stayed in ""The Address"" part of the hotel, the rooms are new and clean, the restaurant is perfect.

The Irish breakfast is not my cup of tea though, I expexted more in the breakfat.",5,2019,11,01
219,Nice hotel - disappointing suite,"We stayed for just the 1 night in October for my partners birthday. Would recomend the 747 bus from the airport, takes about 30 minutes and is pretty much door to door if you get off at Talbot street.

First off, the hotel is really welcoming and friendly check in staff. We were however delayed checking into the room, I had requested an early check in (appreciate this is request and not guaranteed), however the room wasn't ready at 2pm(the actual check in time). I believe this was because I'd arranged drinks on arrival in the room as a surprise and this hadn't been done, the lady checking us in was very helpful in getting this arranged as quick as possible- however I wouldn't have arranged this if I'd have known it would delay check in.

The room facilities are fantastic, wonderful technology, clean and really nice interiors. However, I had booked a suite for us and was very surprised at the room on arrival. There was no seperate living area, double sinks, sofa ( all described as inclusive for a suite when booking). Although the room we had was lovely, I would not class this as a suite which was hugely disappointing as this was the reason I booked the hotel, upon checking out we were not asked how the stay was so did not have the opportunity to feed this back.

The club lounge is well decorated and the staff are superb. The continental breakfast is limited but was fine for what we needed. The evening wine and canapes were pleasant but very limited and not replenished, nice enough for a drink I before heading out though.

Checking out - the hotel kindly kept our luggage for us, however the bags are just left outside the luggage room unattended until a staff member goes past, so we ending up standing waiting as not comfortable leaving bags attending in the lobby.

Overall, a nice stay. Would stay again but would definately not pay the price of a suite again for what is offered.",3,2019,11,01
219,Convenient Location,"Stayed at the North Star Hotel for 4 nights. Upon arrival from a noon flight, we checked into the Hotel quickly and efficiently.  The lobby was pleasant looking and our room distance wasn‚Äôt far.  The room itself was a decent size, but definitely not the fanciest room to stay in. I doubt it was one of their more modern rooms because it certainly wasn‚Äôt luxurious. It was comfortable and clean. The view was a balcony of another dwelling with a colorful refrigerator outside on the balcony.  The breakfast was good, but I didn‚Äôt like its location which was downstairs in the cellar room right across from an okay gym.  All the staff were very helpful, especially Isabella.  We left early morning before breakfast was served but upon request, we had two brown bags full of goodies to take with us.   The hotel is just across the street from Connolly Train Station.  The location itself is just a short distance from shopping, attractions and museums. You can get the Hop on Hop off bus outside Connolly Station and it will take you all around Dublin.  The Temple Bar is a nicer looking area, but you‚Äôll have noise factor to deal with if you want some sleep.",4,2019,10,31
219,Very modern and great location,"Firstly, there is no parking or driveway at the hotel to park our hire car when we arrived. Spoke to the concierge (not helpful or friendly) was told to park at the train station car park ($9.50 Euro a day) ended up having to drag our cases for at least 10 minutes.  We felt the reception staff were not very welcoming or helpful, however was very impressed with the modern facilities of our bedroom and loved the bedding.
Although our room was on the 6th floor it was right next to a railway line so you can hear the trains.  We were offered to move rooms but it would be ones with no windows plus we got use to the noise.
We found the club lounge somewhat basic as there were limited choices white or red wine and the cheese platters were small in portion.  The bar staff were very friendly and the roof top view was nice.",4,2019,10,31
219,Outstanding and high quality hotel üëçüèº,"We booked this hotel through lastminute.com and we were not disappointed!! 
The staff were extremely helpful and the room was outstanding. The food in the restaurant was amazing as was the breakfast which was reasonably priced.
A fantastic location for the city centre, which is just a few minutes walk away. 
The room was spotless and had everything we needed - clean, homely and truly amazing. 
Thank you for making our first trip to Dublin so enjoyable - we will definitely be returning to this amazing hotel and recommending it to our friends and family!",5,2019,10,30
219,Great quality and service,"I was trying to find somewhere to have breakfast and walked-in to this hotel, for my surprise the food was really great and our server Odessa was really kind and polite. Will definitely come back for breakfast.",5,2019,10,29
219,Pretty good stay!,"This hotel was better than expected, it was super clean, smells great staff was super nice and helpful. It's walking distance to most places, if you like walking at least, if you don't the train and bus stations are near by. Our room had it's own temperature control which was even better! There were bathrobes provided and even bed slippers. We had a coffee maker, mini fridge and water.",5,2019,10,29
219,Amazing,"We go to Dublin for a couples weekend at least once a yr for the past 7 years and this is thee best hotel we have stayed at. Beautiful rooms. Lighting, tv , curtains, temp all managed from touchscreen by your bed. Food great, music selection great. Just a really lovely stay. Currently booking our next stay . Thank you x",5,2019,10,28
219,Great time,Great place to stay. Accomadations were fantastic. The employees were all very helpful. Security was very good. Cleanliness was superb. It was close to the things we wanted to do and to see. Thank you for nice stay,1,2019,10,28
219,Confusion reigned,"Checked in and was allocated my room number and pass key. However as I arrived at my room three ladies were already entering!! Was glad I saw them otherwise I would have walked in on them!! Went back to reception - which was so very poor - sadly the reception staff seem untrained and incapable! A new room was allocated. The room was warm, clean and comfortable and without fault. 
But what a basic error!!!",3,2019,10,27
219,So near perfection - yet so far,"Our room was perfect despite the very warm duvet which my wife loved!!
So why just three stars???
Two reasons - reception and lounge. 
The check in despite a supposed priority facility was unmanned slow and laborious as was the check out when the printer didn‚Äôt function and yet again there was nobody on the priority desk. 
We left our luggage for a few hours but it was set unsupervised in reception causing us to sit and oversee until it was eventually collected. ANYBODY could have accessed it for over ten minutes. 
And the lounge - spartan and uninviting. During the day a choice of coffee or water with not even a biscuit! And at 6.30pm the highlight of free wine and cheese. My heart went out to the young man charged with presenting the most pathetic cheeseboard where the biscuits ran out after ten minutes with no replenishment and the choice of wine was ‚Äòred or white‚Äô and he knew nothing about the two very average wines on offer. This lounge was a real disappointment and totally characterless too! Went on Sunday morning for coffee before checking out to find the coffee machine not available due to routine maintenance at 11.30am!! Enough said. A superb hotel experience but rough at the edges due to a complete lack of finesse.  ",3,2019,10,27
219,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Pros: 
- Absolutely precisely clean
- Very very comfortable
- Breakfast is very rich
- In the room you always have coffee and tea
- Very close to the city center
- One of the best hotel I've ever been anywhere

Cons:
- Exactly during my stay there were some repair works and it was very noisy during the day",5,2019,10,26
219,Visit to Dublin,"The Address was lovely, only disappointment was the trains right outside the window!  Luckily it was the weekend and they don't run quite as regularly! 6.15 am Saturday morning is too early though!!!!!!",4,2019,10,26
219,40th Wedding Anniversary Celebrations,"We had our wedding reception in the North Star Hotel in 1979 and decided to return for our 40th wedding anniversay - the staff were amazing, we were given the James Joyce Suite, we had fab food and were treated like celebrities.  Owner Brian McGetting even came to speak with us while we were dining.  Thanks a million to all staff at the North Star Hotel",5,2019,10,22
219,Fabulous hotel,"We would definitely recommend The Address at Dublin 1, great hotel And the rooms are very comfortable, just wish we had a McGettigans where we live as the food was outstanding.  The selection you have at Breakfast is great and tastes lovely, the staff are always very polite, helpful and friendly and we will definitely be back, thanks to the hotel for making our stay in Dublin for our Anniversary that little bit more special, the Anniversary card and welcome cake with chocolates was very thoughtful.",5,2019,10,22
219,Needs attention to detail,"All in all, this could be an excellent hotel if more attention were paid to detail.  My wife and I were booked at this hotel group as part of a tour group for a two night stay.  Our room, though small, was pleasant save for an extremely firm mattress which left my wife with a sore back in the morning.  On the night before our departure (scheduled for 0700), we requested a wakeup call at 0530.  The person on the desk taking my call confirmed our room number from the caller ID and clearly understood the requested time.  Thank God we had awakened early, because we never received a wakeup call.  Two female members of our group, sharing a room, were startled when a couple of males suddenly entered the door to their room.  As I understand, our fellow travelers then had to go to the desk, late in the evening, to get the matter straightened out and have their room keys reprogrammed.  Also, on the morning of our departure, despite prior arrangements, the breakfast staff were somewhat lackadaisical in opening the room for breakfast.  When I brought to their attention that they were slow to open, I was greeted with an attitude by the person who (finally) opened the room.  On the other hand, I did find other employees, e.g., housekeepers, to be very friendly, and the breakfast buffet very enjoyable.  With some attention to detail, this hotel could easily attain a higher rating in my opinion.",3,2019,10,21
219,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful hotel in an ideal location, directly opposite a train station and minutes walk to a bus Station. Also within walking distance of lots of attractions, shops and restaurants/bars. The staff were very friendly and we felt very welcomed. They had arranged for a little surprise in our room for my partners birthday which was set up so lovely. We has our evening meal, breakfast and had coffee at the hotel and they were all lovely. The room was a lovely size and very comfortable, only downfall was it was a bit noisy at night with people passing but otherwise I have no complaints. We would definitely recommend this hotel and with hopefully return in the future.",5,2019,10,17
219,Girls Weekend,"Lovely hotel, a lot nicer than expected. Great location, near to bus stops, tram and train. Bus stop from airport a 2 min walk away. 
3 of us shared a room, plenty of space. Clean, modern and comfortable.
Would stay again.",5,2019,10,15
219,"Lovely hotel, fairly central","Had a lovely stay in this hotel for a long weekend on Dublin. Modern interior, room was comfortable. My only negative was that the room backed into building works, thankfully they weren't in over the weekend but it was a loud awakening on the Monday before check out & would have appreciated some warning from reception staff on check in as we literally has builders standing outside our window. Otherwise a very pleasant stay but if planning a future visit I would ask about any building works.",4,2019,10,15
219,Top hotel,"My stay in the North Star hotel was very enjoyable its location is ideal for the Luas as I was traveling to the point, staff very friendly and hotel and rooms spotless, the only complaint I would have is how warm the rooms were ",5,2019,10,15
219,One of my favourite spots in Dublin City.,"Without doubt one of my favourite places to eat in town. Attention to everything happens there.  Great food, top notch cocktails, nice feel about the place..quality.  Staff are really lovely too, especially our waiter David who knew the menu inside out..(helped my vegan friend out).",5,2019,10,14
219,Long weekend away,"Hotel was clean and tidy 
There is work going on during our stay
Our room was 162 ground floor and our window was covered in cement splatter which was a shame but no big issue as we were not staying in looking out of the window!!!
The hotel was clean staff helpful  and food and drink reasonably priced 
My only complaint was that we always strip our bed for the room maid before we checked out , and we found that the bed protection sheet had not been changed and still had the hair and stains from a previous resident, we did not complain as we only found this out at the end of our stay , other than this we will return 
Thank for a chilled out stay",4,2019,10,14
219,"Trip to Dublin, Ireland","Great trip and good ,well located hotel close to airport bus, Hop-on/off  bus service, local transportation  and in walking distance to food and attractions. There are many different sight to see whatever your taste is whether historical, evening entertainment or local store and people.",5,2019,10,12
219,"Nice Hotel, Bad Staff","The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous but the staff had completely ruined the experience of staying here for us. Upon arrival there was a mistake made with my card and i was charged the full amount when i had asked not to have been until check out, however this was not the issue. At check out i was met with a woman, wearing some sort of manager badge, who was instantly unwelcoming. I was made to feel as though i didnt belong there at all. She got very annoyed with the confusion on my card as there is more to it but i will not explain on this. Another man at the desk got involved and the two seemed very agitated with each other which made me feel even more uncomfortable and confused, they grabbed papers out of each others hands and were speaking in a foreign language at a very loud tone. No one was explaining anything to me and i was asked if they could see my bank account, to see if i had in fact been charged twice(which i had been). I began to get very frustrated and asked what there is to be done, the woman continued to make me feel as though the entire situation was my fault when i had nothing to do with the mistakes THEY made using MY card. Finally, another man came over and reassured me he would sort everything out for me and that i was free to leave if i wanted to, at that point i was so uncomfortable being there i took him up on his offer. Everything is sorted out now but at no thanks to the hotel at all. Reading through other reviews clearly this hotel need to do some checks through their staff and revaluate the type of people they have representing them. I will not be returning and i will be advising people to look for another hotel.",2,2019,10,11
219,"Lovely, luxurious hotel","Good welcome, superb rooms,quite high tech. excellent housekeeping service and reception. well placed for city centre and transport connections. It is very close to the overhead railway, so some of the rooms could be a bit noisy, but we enjoyed our visit!",5,2019,10,09
219,"great place to stay, shame about the check in","ON CHECKING IN WE WERE GIVEN A ROOM THAT WAS OCCUPIED BY SOMEONE ELSE!! I DONT KNOW WHO WAS MORE SHOCKED,,,THEM OR US!!  THE NIGHT MANAGER ASKED A MEMBER OF STAFF TO GO CHECK ANOTHER ROOM!! HE RANG TO SAY IT WAS ALSO OCCUPIED!!....He asked us had we booked and when were we supposed to be checked in??!! The next morning we spoke to the manager whotold us the night manager thought we were with the people in the previous room...which was rubbish because that would have made the room over occupied!! and also he asked for my name for the booking when we arrived at the hotel!! We were given a free breakfast for the next morning which was a nice gesture, but not to have had this happen would have been better!!  The domestic staff are very very friendly, maybe some of the receptionists could take a few lessons from them!!",5,2019,10,08
219,Great place to stay,"This hotel was great. Good service at the front desk and with the concierge. The room was very nice , quiet, and clean. The location was good. Breakfast was not included, so we didn't eat there. Couldn't have been happier with our stay. ",5,2019,10,08
219,Highly Recommend,"First time in Dublin and glad we chose this hotel.

Good location, easy to get to most places from the bus/tram station 2 minutes walk away. They sell the Dodublin hop on hop off bus tickets at the front desk of the hotel too. These are a must have if you are exploring- great money saver.

Very clean and tidy inside. Building work going on around the outside of the hotel so a little noisy in the day but doesn't affect the inside,unless you want to nap in the day.

Staff are helpful and friendly. I told them in advance it was my boyfriends birthday and we got a free upgrade, and there was a birthday cake and card in the room for him when we arrived. Very cute.
Beds are super comfy and rooms have all the mod cons you could need.

Only things that maybe could improve- restaurant for breakfast is on the bottom level and the lift is a bit bumpy (we just took the stairs instead) and the restaurant itself is very warm. 
Food was great though, best cooked breakfast we have had in a long time.
 Just be better if there was some aircon down there.
We didnt try the cafe for lunch or afternoon tea but it always seemed busy and there is another restaurant at street level for dinner. Didnt try it  but the menu looked good and prices ok",4,2019,10,07
219,The place to be in Dublin ,"Was my first time in Dublin and stayed at the address . 
Very nice room , high tech and love the curtains that u just touch a button and it closes or open , spacious and clean room . 
The welcoming at the reception by Collin with a great smile made me feel at home . 
Breakfast was super nice with super friendly staff. 
I enjoyed my 8 days at the address . Will surely recommend. 
Want to Thk everyone who made my stay there fantastic especially Collin . 
Will surely come back . ",5,2019,10,06
219,A very enjoyable stay with an upgrade,"This was my second stay at the North Star Hotel in Dublin - a very enjoyable one, I was upgraded to a business suite, which really elevates the comfort. The suite was on the upper floor, in a silent location. ",5,2019,10,04
219,The North is a Star,"Arrived on a very wet and cold September afternoon to a warm welcome from the receptionist who informed me that I had been upgraded to a junior suite free of charge, happy days,

The suite was very modern with not one but two televisions, very handy for when we have very different tastes in that department.

The bar and restaurant were very pleasant with a good pint and the food was excellent also, would recommend the Northstar for a night in Dublin ",5,2019,10,02
219,Amazing hotel and experience,"We were on our honeymoon and got upgraded to a suite which was amazing. We had a great weekend, great hotel with lots of different bars, restaurants etc, and amazingly friendly staff. Having the use of the club lounge and the complimentary breakfast, wine was a real treat which made our weekend super special. We will be back ",5,2019,10,02
219,Worst experience,"This was our last stop and not impressed. There is hardly anything around to see, there is no parking so you need to go to the train station parking and pay for 24 hour parking. The staff are very short with you and make you feel like an inconvenience. Also there is construction all around this around and we were woke up around 640-7am with hotel construction. WiFi is very spotty not Consistent. Breakfast is great.",1,2019,10,02
219,High-tech and lovely!,"This hotel (along with the North Star) is in an historic site visited/referred to by some of the great Irish authors back in the day.  Now the Address is super high-tech in fun ways.  The staff are lovely - professional, helpful, willing to go out of their way.  The place is clean and attractive.  The complimentary club room on the roof is great with evening wine and snacks, and a continental breakfast in the morning.  The only negative is that being across from the train station puts it in a slightly dodgy neighborhood, but it also makes it fabulous for public transit.",5,2019,09,30
219,Disappointed,"Stayed here for 1 night with 2 teenage children. We had requested 2 single beds for the kids but our room had 2 doubles which maybe the way all family rooms are configured. Room was a bit small but clean and well maintained with comfortable beds. We arrived late in the evening and hungry. The only food available after 10 was a pizza or sandwich on room service which was fine. A ham and cheese sandwich (not toasted) and a margarita pizza 12inch cost ‚Ç¨27! Outrageous! The following morning my husband and son left early to attend an event they were gone about an hour when at 8am hammering and drilling in the room next door woke me. A knock came to the door at 8.30 from a maintenance man he said but we received no call from reception to advise us to expect it so i shouted that i wasnt dressed he apologised and left. A lite later as i was dressing another knock came to the door and it was opened by a woman, who appeared to be a staff member, before i could react. She apologised and left. Myself and my daughter at that point felt we were being ""encouraged"" to leave. We decided to get breakfast first. Breakfast was good with plenty of choices, but again at ‚Ç¨15 is expensive. Overall i found staff to be helpful and polite if a bit detatched. There were signs apologising for inconvenience while renovations were being carried out, however hammering and drilling in a room next to paying guests at 8am is not an inconvenience its a disturbance. Im not really impressed. I made my views known at reception when leaving the receptionist asked if i wanted to talk to a manager. I declined as my daughter was with me ans i didnt want a drama with her involed so we just left. Based on my experience i wont be recommending this hotel.",3,2019,09,30
219,"Very nice hotel, shame about the trains","Was looking forward to our visit here and we were not dissatisfied with the hotels facilities or food, all very good. The staff were ok on the whole but the rear rooms were very disappointing- trains going by until midnight!! If you like a quiet room and are a light sleeper...not good. Should have researched a little better..",3,2019,09,30
219,Great Visit,"We stayed at The Address At Dublin 1 twice during our vacation. This is a fantastic hotel with a friendly staff with attention to detail. The room was filled with technology that could be customized for guests needs. Certain packages include light breakfasts and a happy hour including wine and cheese at a roof top dining area. We met many visitors that made this visit extra special. Our flight came in early in the morning and the hotel took our luggage before we checked in. The location was perfect for us as it was close to a rail station, bus station and LUCAS. We did not have any issues with the noise of the trains. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Dublin.",5,2019,09,29
219,Mostly good,"Nice moderate hotel in a so-so neighborhood, but walking distance to Dublin's centre and many attractions, as well as Croke Park, where I attended a conference. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was in a dingy basement room with reasonable food options but very poor coffee. The restaurant had very poor service for dinner (I am a middle aged woman, dining alone). It took 25 minutes for a server to even notice me. However, the food (catch of the day and blood orange sponge dessert) was truly excellent. Front desk staff very nice and remembered my name each day. All in all, a good stay.",4,2019,09,29
219,Adequate,"Plenty of positives for this hotel which has had a much needed refurb. Staff are consistently attentive, friendly and efficient. Rooms clean.
Main problems are things that the best management in the world can‚Äôt remedy: as a building it is sprawling and this is most apparent when you go for breakfast. Also building is near train station and you will notice this in some rooms. 
Clearly caters a lot  for organised tours and I don‚Äôt think you would go wrong if this is the place you spend short amount of time in but use as a base for travelling on day trips. Not somewhere I‚Äôd pick if I wanted to hang out in a hotel for a while.",3,2019,09,29
219,Great Stay,Very attentive staff.  The room was clean and modern.  It was also very roomy for Europe.  The lounge on the top floor had an outdoor area  where you could drink complimentary wine served with snacks.  Easy access to transportation.  Great value.  ,5,2019,09,27
219,"Great place to stay,","Very hand location, very friendly and helpful people, especially Colin on the reception desk, very patient and helpful printing out our boarding passes, great place to stay, train station very handy for the DART",5,2019,09,27
219,Not worth the price,"Our usual hotel was booked and North Star looked like a good alternative ...but it was not. 

You have a sign outside stating North Star, but when inside it‚Äôs The Address and no one seems to acknowledge the existence of North Star. Pretty confusing and time consuming check-in due to?
The location is good and the rooms were nice, but with the Dart train passing just outside the window every 15 min. almost 24/7, you should be a ‚Äúheavy sleeper‚Äù to get any sleep. 
Furthermore the hotel is being renovated and the smell of paint just took over in a bad way. 
The breakfast options are way below standard.
I will not be back. ",2,2019,09,25
219,Excellent,"It was our third time staying here for a concert, couldn't recommend it highly enough, staff go above and beyond, the lady at the desk even gave me a umbrella when the weather turned, our room was fab, very modern, they have done a fantastic job on the renovations, will definitely be back, keep up the good work.",5,2019,09,23
219,Charming and quaint,This hotel looks charming and quaint but inside the rooms the bathrooms are modern and the room has more space than expected.  All of the staff members were incredibly friendly and helpful. We were here on a Great Value Vacation that we purchased through Groupon.,5,2019,09,22
219,Girls weekend,"Fantastic hotel with friendly staff and very clean facilities. Great location for both when you get a bus from the airport (stop opposite) and within walking distance to O‚Äô Connell street, Grafton Street and the famous temple bar (perfect after a few Guinness‚Äô). Will definitely stay again when back in Dublin. ",5,2019,09,22
219,Not very happy with our stay,I usually don‚Äôt leave reviews like this but felt it was necessary. Worst hotel we stayed in Ireland. The location is great but we felt the hotel was terrible. The shower and bathroom floor was full of mold. We had to ask them 3 times to come clean it. No help with our bags and had to park at the train station. The staff was very cold. There was a light in our room that would turn on and off throughout the night and couldn‚Äôt be fixed. The fire alarm also went off in the middle of the night which they said was a false alarm. All in all I would stay somewhere else if visiting Dublin.,2,2019,09,20
219," Visit","The hotel was well located, 10mins to the city centre which was very convenient.. the staff was very friendly.. we arrived early morning at the hotel, and the room was not ready.. but Colin at the desk was friendly and welcoming.. kept our luggage at hotel while we went visiting the city and the keys was ready prepared in the afternoon when we return in the hotel.. room was clean and comfortable bed to sleep, highly recommended place to stay in Dublin",5,2019,09,18
219,1st Time to the City,"Recently stayed at the hotel on a 2 night stay in the city with friends. We reserved our room only offer for 4 online via booking.com for a reasonable price. Having landed into Dublin airport we used the Airlink bus service which cost ‚Ç¨12 return to get to and from the hotel. The bus stop was located just a short walk away for both trips and the hotel was easy to find. 

On arrival we were met by a friendly receptionist who confirmed our booking and checked us in. We were given a room located on the 3rd floor at the end of the corridor. The room itself was of a decent size and had two double beds located within. There were four adult females sharing this family room which was adequate for our needs and didnt at any point feel like we were on top of each other. It was clean and newly refurbed as described. There were still signs around the hotel that the refurb is still underway but we never experienced any noise or dirt. 

The room had tea and coffee facilities along with a hair dryer and enough towels for the four of us staying in this room. Toiletries were also included though we didnt use them. The room was also cleaned and towels changed during our 2 night stay. 

We didnt opt for breakfast at the hotel which cost ‚Ç¨16 euros per person and chose to eat out in the city itself. Personally although there did appear to be a good selection of breakfast choices unless this was included in my room price I would not pay the price they were requesting. 

The hotel itself exceeded my expectations and I would definitely look to stay here again should I ever visit the city. The hotel is ideally located to walk into the city but far enough away not to be right on top of the hustle and bustle of it all. ",4,2019,09,17
219,Dublin‚Äôs Gem,The welcome you get is 5 star as well as the rooms we were bowled over. When we arrived we had cake and tea in the parlour. We decided on our evening meal too and couldn‚Äôt of been happier. We will be back most definitely. Thank you so much x,5,2019,09,17
219,High standard!,"Majority of the staff where extremely helpful especially Owen who rectified an error in our booking promptly and efficiently. I would advise anyone with a disability to not book any of the 100 or 200 rooms as there is no elevator to the first two floors. However the rooms are very clean, tidy and fresh the cleaners are friendly and attentive nothing is too much trouble. The main hotel restaurant is amazing and you should absolutely try the creme br√ªl√©e it‚Äôs to die for ! 
Will definitely be staying here again :) ",5,2019,09,17
219,2 nite stay,"Lovely updated hotel. Rooms were nicely decorated but very poor lighting.  Breakfast included, usual selection of breakfast items. Not a bad location. Friendly staff, willing to help with your needs. Amenities were plentiful.",4,2019,09,17
219,Two day stay for a wedding,"The hotel is in a very busy location, opposite Connolly station in Dublin 1. The area is somewhat run down with lots of beggars and people passing through. Drug abuse may be a problem amongst some beggars.

The hotel ambience is nice inside. The hotel staff are welcoming and efficient, but not too friendly. Concierge desk does not advise travel too well. Maps get poked at with emphasis, but listening for what the hotel traveller really wants would be even better. 

Rooms are average. Ours had very noisy air con inside. Too hot without it on, but felt like an air turbine with air con switched on. Train station ruins a good night sleep with breaks screetchy on the passing of frequent carriages, noticeable at night. 

Bathrooms were clean, but shower-bath was a tight space even for a small sized family and shower controls were a bit too basic. 

Breakfast is poor at the hotel. You can't have just cereal and toast and tea without paying the full hot breakfast buffet price of ‚Ç¨15. The breakfast area is not very well stocked, staff are not very attentive either. Must provide more flexible breakfast options with lower prices and train staff better for breakfast serving. 

Overall the hotel is nice. Staff are a punctilious bunch, but the hotel could be so much more comfortable.",3,2019,09,16
219,Great!,"Wonderful times were had by all, would do I again. I had my own room to myself so I felt like a king among men, a god among common peasants. I could stay here again in a heart beat, you just tell me when.",5,2019,09,15
219,Beautiful Gem & Historic Hotel,"This hotel was so beautiful and very chic modern decor. I stayed @ The Address part of the hotel. Loved it had a private elevator to Address part of the hotel. The staff was so professional and friendly and very helpful. Fell in love with this place. When I return to Dublin I will definitely stay again. The hotel is centrally located.

I'm not a big tech person but I loved the tech the room had very convenient. Everything at your fingertips. The bed was so big soft and comfy. The staff went above and beyond to make me feel like at home. The room service was very nice and the food was really good. Loved the pub @ the hotel it was really nice and the staff was super friendly and professional. A true gem in a historic and enchanting city.",5,2019,09,14
219,"Lovely hotel in Dublin, close to all attractions. ",Stayed here for a night in September 2019. The North Star is a lovely hotel close to Connelly train station. We were upgraded to a smart room and had loads of fun with the technology. Great service with friendly and attentive staff.,4,2019,09,13
219,Good deal,"Well located, this hotel deliver good service level. Very gentle employees always answering professionally. Rooms are clean and well equipped. maybe a little bit noisy when you are at 1rst or 2nd (my case), but no issue to sleep. Breakfast is complete, but the room in basement without external light is always surprising for a French person ",4,2019,09,13
219,Very enjoyable stay overall. Can recommend.,"The room was enjoyable and the staff is very friendly, from the head manager to the housekeepers. The room is fitted with high tech controls, for example allowing you to open the curtains and set DND from the comfort of your bed. If you keep the remote by your bed you can even order room service. The only thing I was not a 100% fan of was breakfast - complimentary breakfast is included and includes things like cereal, fruit and croissants, but I've had more featureful complimentary breakfasts at cheaper hotels. Having said that, breakfast is good enough for me and the daily ""happy hour"" of complimentary snacks and wine does very much make up for it.",4,2019,09,13
219,Nice hotel in a great location,Nice hotel in a great location. Clean modern rooms with a great bar and restaurant attached. Only down side was no in site parking but the friendly gentleman at concierge pointed me to the Connelly Station car park. Check in and out was a breeze.,5,2019,09,12
219,Almost Great,"Overall, we had a very good experience.  We had booked thinking we were in the North Star Hotel but apparently both are housed in the same building.  The first weekend we stayed we had a nice room - its a smart room which is both good and bad.  The bad being that in the middle of the night if you get up the lights under the bed and in the bathroom come on automatically and you can't switch them off.  I just want the dark!  We'd paid for the full breakfast which was quite good.  The second weekend we stayed in a larger room but unfortunately it smelled of smoke.  I had a hard time getting past that trying to sleep... The second room allowed us access to the rooftop lounge and that was a nice place to grab quick brekkie and coffee in the morning.  The manager's reception in the evening was not the best.  When they set out a few trays of appetizers people swarmed and picked off everything very quickly.  It was a little cramped...But overall, the staff and quite friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel - but bring your sleep mask :)",4,2019,09,12
219,Good stay but not as high quality as I expected,"The reception area is very smart, as is the bar/restaurant. Check-in was ok although a pretty long queue. 
The Address is an annex to the main hotel (North Star) and there seems to be just one small lift to get to the rooms. Luckily I was on a lower floor as I had to use the stairs several times as I simply gave up waiting (the lift is VERY slow) or there was a long queue for it. 
The room was nice - smart, good facilities, very comfy bed. Breakfast was fine - nice fresh cooked food. Staff very helpful. A nice touch is the small roof top terrace/bar where you can have a complimentary glass of wine at 6.30pm.
However the attention to detail in the room wasn't so good. Loose towel rack in the bathroom, missing panel in the cupboard, curtain hanging down and didn't close properly, door had to be firmly pulled closed or it didn't lock. These are all simply things that could be fixed with attention to detail. The tech in the room wasn't great either. The 'feature lighting' didn't work - just flashed once then nothing happened. There seemed to be lights attached to sensors that turn on when you get out of bed but they kept coming on randomly. To check the food menu and other info you use the TV which is fine unless you're watching something and you have to go to the home menu.
Overall a decent stay and I'd stay again but wouldn't go out of my way to use this hotel. ",3,2019,09,12
219,"Less than desirable area, warm a/c and less than friendly staff","First off, this hotel is located in a less than desirable area. It's loud (directly across the street from the transportation depot) and very close to the street. We witnessed several highly intoxicated people laying on sidewalks close to the hotel and there are many homeless walking around. The area surrounding the hotel is not clean and has a very pungent odor. Public parking for a fee is available down a long, dark, suspect street. 

We checked in and hoped for the best as this hotel has a certificate of excellence. While the interior is nice, it's not comfortable. The staff isn't friendly nor are they overly concerned with your experience during your stay. 

Our room a/c was not cold. The room stayed at a steady 78 which is overly warm during somewhat of a heat wave in Dublin and there are no windows to open to get a breeze. When we addressed with the front desk, they sent someone up and said ""it's blowing so it's working"". After several attempts to rectify the situation, we were given a desk top fan and told that's all they could do. The room never got cooler. 

We had booked a 3-night stay and decided only to stay one evening due to our experience. We very nearly were not allowed to check out early. We had to speak with the manager who was short and did not offer much of an apology. 

If you're looking for a hotel in Dublin, book on the other side of the river (south) and most certainly don't book your stay here.",1,2019,09,11
219,Very nice hotel,"We stayed in both the North Star and it‚Äôs attached premium sister hotel The Address. Both were fantastic hotels, excellent service. The food in the hotel restaurant was enjoyable enough to enjoy several times when we were too tired from our day to go anywhere else. Deirdre was our server many evenings and she was just delightful! She was very efficient, pleasant, and a hard worker. The hotel itself was easily walkable to many of the major sites we wanted to see. ",5,2019,09,11
219,Very nice and conveniently located hotel,Great hotel that is next to public transportation and city attractions as well as close to tourist offices making walks to the inner city quite manageable. Only negative is the train seems to be quite close in proximity so it can be heard quite loud from the hotel room.,4,2019,09,10
219,Wonderful Stay,"Lovely stay at this hotel. All the staff were friendly, helpful and amazing and a special mention to Luke who‚Äôs professional polite approach by going beyond what was expected. Well done on your choice of staff at this fabulous hotel!",5,2019,09,09
219,Great Location as Across the Street from Dublin Connolly Station,"We stayed at this hotel twice:  one night in August and again, one night in September.  The first time we stayed there, check-in was efficient.  The room was clean.  It was a triple (three twin beds), so it was a bit tight for space.  However, it had a functional safe and small fridge (great!).  There were sufficient towels and a stand for your suitcase.  It was right across the road from the train station, so it was amazingly convenient.  We walked up the road beside the hotel and there were shops, restaurants and pubs, all within a short walk.  The air-conditioning was strong, but very noisy.  We should have called maintenance to see if it could have been adjusted, but we were just there for a night.  Staff were friendly and it was a positive experience.

The second time we stayed there, check-in was backed up and the lady let one man butt in front of the line, when she saw that I had been patiently waiting for 10 minutes.  That didn't impress me.  The man who finally served me was a trainee, but he was very nice and helpful.  We took a cab into the city (Exeter Street) and walked around.  It was just over 13 Euros to get there.  The room had a double bed and a twin.  It was somewhat small, as well, but the air-conditioning was comfortable and it was clean.  Initially, when we arrived, the lights were not working in our room and I called down to the front desk.  Within minutes, a maintenance person was at our door and fixed the problem right away (a card was missing from a slot near the door.)  Impressive service.  We also ate a restaurant/bar that we walked into from the main floor - Madigan's.  I wrote a separate review about them, but the easy access to the restaurant/bar was much appreciated.  If you are travelling by rail, this hotel is very convenient and has good amenities for the cost.  We recommend it and I would use it again if I were travelling through Connolly Station in Dublin.",4,2019,09,09
219,Great Stay,I was traveling with my family and chose this hotel. The rooms were beautifully appointed with state of the art technology. Had a great lighting in the bathroom for make up/shaving which so many hotels miss. Staff was friendly and good location. The bed was incredibly comfortable! ,5,2019,09,09
219,Great Value,"Staff was friendly, helpful and engaging. I will be returning for a brief stay prior to leaving for home at the end of my vacation. Especially enjoyed the little cafe, great selections and excellent ‚ÄúAmericanos‚Äù. I can honestly say I‚Äôm looking forward to my return. ",5,2019,09,09
219,Excellent... ,"My wife and I spent one night in this fabulous hi tech, hi spec hotel... The service, staff, rooms and overall experience was second to none... Location is perfect with Connolly train station across the road.. We will be back.. ",5,2019,09,08
219,Our stay in Northstar,"I stayed with Northstar for a week and would definitely rate this as a great place to stay. The location is so very central in the city and the hotel by itself is very cosy, comfortable, clean and very helpful and warm staff.

My only suggestion is if they could add the complementary breakfast at least for 1 day it would be a good idea . Otherwise great place no complaints at all !

",5,2019,09,08
219,Ireland,"Hotel is across the road from Connelly Station and airporr
bus. Rooms are quiet and  clean. Staff are friendly and helpful . Breakfasts had a variety of foods to suit most tastes. Bar and restaurants were quiet and served a range of foods and drinks.",5,2019,09,07
219,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff","Our stay went very well. Hotel could not have done any more to make our stay perfect. It is a very attractive place to be, made better by very good, friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend to anyone. Nothing to criticise.",5,2019,09,06
219,Comfortable hotel,"Property looked little aged from outside but inside, everything is as modern as any and is very well made rooms and very comfortable too. Restaurant is good and staff are very friendly and pleasant. I had a comfortable stay during my visit to Dublin. Location is good and is nearby to the City centre and has lot of restaurants close by too.",4,2019,09,06
219,Very nice hotel,"Staff very friendly and professional, rooms clean and comfortable, all in one a very satisfactory stay. Stayed there 2 years ago and the refurbishments made since than in the hotel are fabulous, well done.",5,2019,09,06
219,Good overall,"We spent 4 nights at North Star while vacationing in Dublin. We arrived early and were hoping for an earlier check in. The option was advertised on their web site, but there was no availability:(. On a positive note, we could leave our luggage at the hotel till room became available. The room was good size and very clean, kettle, mini fridge, tea and instant coffee provided, however the furniture and bath tub had signs of aging-chips and scratches here and there.Toilet was flushing slowly and ineffectively. TV had only a handful channels in English, more international channels would be appreciated by the customers. Hotel has a restaurant, gym and sauna, which we did not use due to lack of time because of our scheduled activities. They also have a concierge. If you look at the hotel from outside, it appears that rail track goes through the hotel, surprisingly, there was practically no noise noticeable from the trains, but there was some construction on the street level at the time of our stay. Hotel stuff surprised me with a little pastry and chocolates in the room, because it was my birthday. Overall, it was a good stay.",4,2019,09,05
219,Dublin for the big game,"I visited Dublin for the All Ireland football final on 1st September and stayed at the North Star for the Saturday and Sunday nights.
The hotel is easy walking distance fro Croke Park and situated close to the city centre.
Taxi fare from the airport was circa 22euros.
The hotel has been refurbished in a smart but quirky design underneath a rail track but it is not too noisy. There is a gym and spa. A restaurant/Bar, a separate restaurant and a Coffee bar.
Some of the rooms require a steep climb up a stairway to access them, They are not  accessed by elevator, Visitors should be aware of this when booking. 
The room was exceptionally clean and well appointed. However the shower was difficult to use and did not have adequate water pressure. 
 Breakfast was excellent. Dinner in the bar retaraunt was good.
Staff were generally helpful and friendly. 
",4,2019,09,04
219,Great Hotel,"Lovey hotel, the location was great just opposite Connolly street train station. We were allowed to check in early which was appreciated after a long journey. The family room which we had was very good with  modern facilities and a good size with a lovely bathroom. We only had breakfast on one of the mornings, the buffet selection was very substantial and of a good quality. All the staff which we came into contact with were very friendly and welcoming, Would certainly stay here again ",5,2019,09,03
219,Amazing Hotel,"Recently stayed for one night at The North Star and it really was nothing short of outstanding. Hotel room was spotless & modern, beds very comfortable and plenty of towels proved. We arrived early and although our room wasn't ready we were able to store our luggage while we went shopping. What stood out to us the most in this hotel were the kind, curteous staff. From start to finish their care and politeness was second to none and they really should be credited for this. From start to finish we felt really cared for it really makes a difference even the little things like a quick hello how are you or a smile. We will definitely be returning.",5,2019,09,01
219,First of 2 night stay was miserable,"We had signed up for early check in, but room was not ready.  No problem as they held our bags.  We returned in the evening and checked into our room.  The room was hot so we turned the air down and went to dinner.  We came back and room was still hot.  One of the reasons I selected this hotel was because it had airconditiong and many in Ireland do not.  Unfortunately for us they were having unsusally warm weather.  The hotel was full so they could not move our room.  They gave us 3 fans.  The street noise was loud with the window open, kids on a Globus tour were running up and down the hall slamming doors unitl after midnight.  The guy who brought the fans even got on to the kids for noise while he was delivering them, but it didn't help.  Several other guests opened their doors to ask the kids to be quiet...also didn't help.  We were awake most of the night with the heat and noise.  The next morning the manager on duty assured us they would fix the a/c while we were out.  They didn't.  We returned to a hot room and the new manger on duty had no knowlege of anything.  They offered us 10% off our room.  Unaccebtable for the miserable night we had and they finally upped that after speaking with numerous people.  None of this is what you want to spend your vacation time doing.  They did move us to the ""Address"" side of the hotel which was nicer.  There were 3 of us so since those rooms only accomatate 2 people they gave us 2 rooms.  This would have been nice if the rooms were adjoining or even next to each other, but they weren't..  It wasn't really very convenient, but the a/c worked!  It was also much quieter and no kids running around.",3,2019,09,01
219,Lovely staff and modern rooms,"Just returned from an overnight stay at The Address having stayed in the North star premier rooms before.

Location is great, across from Connolly train station. We had the car so parked in IFSC which was 20 euro for 24 hours but they do partner with Connolly station car park for 9 euro overnight rate.

Quick and easy check in and escorted to your room for explanation of room technology. Just a suggestion, the staff member escorting could maybe offer to help with bags. We would have said we didnt need help but it's a small gesture that would make an even better first impression.

We stayed in the Club suite which was very new, modern and clean. Couldn't fault the room. Only down side was the closeness to a train track. It was right outside the window so you could really hear every train going past. For us it was not issue as we live close to a train track but for some just highlighting it as it's not for everyone.

Bed and pillows were so comfy and the space you got a for a room in Dublin was great. Nice bathroom too.

Breakfast we got delivered to the room since the room came with a table and chairs. It arrived up quite cold for a cooked breakfast but when we asked for it to be reheated it wasnt a problem and was quickly rectified.

We had a party to attend in the city that evening before we went home so we asked could we have a late check out until late afternoon. Wasnt an issue at all and they charged a small fee which was completely understandable and reasonable and we were happy to pay so we had somewhere to get ready.

Check out was easy and quick. Staff member checking us out was lovely asking how our stay was, our plans for the evening etc ending our visit with pleasantries.

Would absolutely return and look forward to it.",4,2019,09,01
219,Good rooms and that‚Äôs it,"We stayed for 2 nights for a weekend celebrating my husband‚Äôs birthday in a room with lounge access.
The positives:
- nice rooms with comfy wide beds
- good size bathroom with good amenities
- when I mentioned it was my husband birthday, they organized 1 brownie on a nice plate

The negatives:
- hardly any daylight as our room faced a micro internal courtyard
- lounge breakfast minimal and restocking very late so many people came and left without
- lounge drinks for 60 minutes in the evening starting 15 min late?!
- reception not even asking at check out if everything was ok

Would we stay again, only if I could really not find anything else for 182 Euro/night",3,2019,09,01
219,A reasonable stay.,"The room, we opted for the club room, which as you can see was spacious enough. The IT side worked well, fancy lighting and curtains you can open or close with the tv.

With the club room you get club room access which is basically a glass of wine and some cheese for an hour per day, i didn‚Äôt eat the breakfast there, opted to grab some from the spar just round the corner

Top tip. Get a room higher up in the hotel, we were on floor 4, the trains going past the window were quite frequent, and while not excessively loud, they could be heard and started early and still trundling by past 11pm üôÅ

Parking, not available, but there is a car park quite close, however dropping off and picking up the luggage at the start and end of the trip was interesting as you have to park on double yellow lines

Very handy to get into town from here, but most of the attractions seemed to be on the other side of the water.",4,2019,09,01
219,Brilliant value and service,"When we arrived we were early for the check in, the staff were apologetic about the room not being ready even though we were early. They took our bags for us so we could go exploring. When we came back they checked us in and the staff helped us with our luggage up to the room. The room was massive and very clean. The bed was very comfortable and the cleaning staff were brilliant. They didn't clean our room on one of the days as we left the do not disturb sign on the door but the following day they provided clean towels despite us getting ready to check out. We didn't need to ask the staff for anything but I get the impression they would be more than happy to help. I am very impressed with the price of this hotel and the standard of it. Would deffo stay again",5,2019,08,31
219,"Great location, great staff","The hotel is in a great location. Rooms are modern and clean. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Convenient to train station, city center, and tourist sites. Room has air conditioning which is not in all hotels in Ireland.  The only thing lacking is a nice view from the window. I definitely would stay here again. ",5,2019,08,31
219,Comfy Hotel,My wife and I stayed here three nights on our Ireland vacation.  Very close to restaurants / attractions  by walking or short taxi / bus.  The hotel staff are very friendly.  The concierge staff will arrange tours / lifts to places for you.  Highly recommend,5,2019,08,30
219,City Break,"Fab hotel in a great location! Ideal for shopping, bars and restaurants and sightseeing. Right opposite the train station so handy if you were looking to travel further afield too. I would definately recommend!",5,2019,08,30
219,Great hotel!,"We stayed in a club room at the hotel for a four night city-break in Dublin.  The staff were friendly and efficient, the room was very comfortable (my husband especially enjoyed the high-tech features), the club lounge continental breakfasts and evening wine service were delightful, the concierge was helpful,  and the restaurant was very good.  We would definitely stay there again if we ever return to Dublin.  ",5,2019,08,29
219,Good,"Nice place ,friendly stuff ,they answer every questions we had ,very  clean room very clean hotel  Room was big enough for all of us , -we are four -people the hotel is near the center,near the shopping center ",4,2019,08,28
219,Excellent Bank holiday long weekend ,"The hotel is well situated across the road from Connolly Station (Irish Rail) Overground. Makes it easy for those of you to discover outside of Dublin City. We did day trips to Howth and Bray costal beach towns with mountains and only paid the rail fare opposed to booking with a company. It‚Äôs easy to use and well sign posted.

The Hotel was welcoming and front of house staff attentive to our needs. The rooms were clean and comfortable especially the mattress, had a flat screen tv and tea making facilities in the room. There is also a gym and restaurant.

Our room was 369 the telephone didn‚Äôt work and there wasn‚Äôt much of a view but that didn‚Äôt bother us.

Overall I would definitely stay here again.
",4,2019,08,28
219,"Not good for sleep, Club lounge not worth the money","Tech in the room not particularly well done. Night time lighting function was an unwelcome surprise at 4 a.m. Not explained to us and no option to turn it off.

Club lounge is nothing to write home about - very small with a poor selection of breakfast items, and very restricted in the evenings too. A limited selection of wine and fried food, monitored constantly by staff, for a short period of time. If you are thinking this will be something like a Melia club lounge - it's not, and certainly not worth paying extra for.

However, the biggest issue is the train. We were in the club suite on the second floor, which meant the trains would literally run right beside the walls and windows of the room. If you are not a heavy sleeper then expect to be woken any time from 6 a.m. onwards. When a large diesel engine is paused waiting, and then pulling away, just on the other side of the windows it shakes and vibrates the whole room.
In addition to the train the club suite we had was also situated directly above the smoking area for the cafe/bar downstairs, so customers start sitting outside and chatting from early in the morning, another unwelcome source of noise.

Room itself was a good size, nicely decorated, well equipped.

Trainee agent at the desk for check in was very curt and unfriendly - not in the least welcoming. 

We go to Dublin often, but we won't be going back to The Address.
If it was in a better location I would consider it, but when I'm on a city break I do like the option of staying asleep past six a.m.",3,2019,08,28
219,"Great hotel, great location","The North Star Hotel is a nice clean hotel. Short taxi ride from the airport and short taxi ride to the cruise port.  This hotel is also close to the train. We were able to walk to the city centre with ease. The room itself was very nice. All standard in room amenities included and there is a nice restaurant on location. We had breakfast at the complementary continental breakfast located on the top floor (coffee/tea, fruit, pastries). You can also purchase a full breakfast at another dining area located on a lower floor.",5,2019,08,28
219,Very nice room and a great sleep,"I stayed at the North Star for seven wonderful nights.  Nights of sleep in a wonderful bed in a temperature controlled room with coffee maker and empty fridge and lots of space to move, two good chairs, a desk, many placesto put clothing and hang shirts up, and an ample bathroom.  Indeed, on first seeing the room I exclaimed ""is all this for me?""  There was no street noise despite being right near a busy train station.

The front desk staff were consistently helpful, and the concierge looked up things for me and contacted people if he was unclear on the truth.  Above and beyond the call of duty. There was a small problem with my key cards after six nights but they attended to it promptly.

Cleaning was done well.  The one thing that was broken in my room (a bathroom panel) was fixed before the end of my stay, and I didn't even report it.

Hotel was well located for airport bus and for local tram service.  Many amenities a short walk away.  Laundry service.

Only two flaws.  No ice machine.  Ice had to be fetched from the lobby.  I never like that.

And the major flaw - the breakfast buffet.  It never changed, and lacked good fruit and had no vegetables.  It just wasn't healthy, although they had great cooked tomatoes and potato patties and sausage, and a very silly pancake making machine.

And they were inconsistent with breakfast timing.  I was told 7:00 but two times I came down at 7:00 to find the buffet packed with people because they had opened it early.  I would have liked to know about this, because when the buffet got crowded it was hard to get your coffee promptly - they have no coffee machines but bring pots to the table - which is wonderful if prompt.  And when the brunch got crowded, certain things disappeared faster than they could be replenished.

So I slept well but didn't eat as well as I would have liked.  But I can still recommend the hotel without question to anyone who has a long stay in Dublin.",4,2019,08,25
219,Beautiful hotel!,Beautiful hotel with amazing amenities. The room was beautiful and the beds were so comfortable! The service was also excellent. The front desk staff was very accommodating. The breakfast had a ton of variety including pancakes you could make yourself.,5,2019,08,25
219,Amazing ,"It is a great hotel which is very well situated for those who want to walk to the city centre. Also ideal if you want to catch the train to go to Howth,the harbour. Mr Collins who had us at the reception was very helpful and friendly to discuss. Overall it was a great stay.",5,2019,08,25
219,Close to all amenities,"Only stayed the one night, The Jonathan Swift Room' on the 6th floor. from the off the staff at reception gave us a comprehensive overview of the hotel and what was on offer. The room was 1st class and the breakfast was comprehensive and really good. We'd travelled by train an the station is just across the road.",5,2019,08,23
219,Wonderful,Stayed for one night at the start of our vacation and one night at the end.  Close enough to walk to everything but no close enough to hear all the city noise.  They store bags without any issues.  Taxis available right across the street.  ,5,2019,08,22
219,Lucky Find in Northside Dublin,"I chose The North Star / The Address through the housing bureau of a convention I was attending in Dublin.  My main criteria were that it was within 1 km of the Dublin Convention Center and that it was reasonably priced.  Little did I know what a gem of a hotel this was! 

First, the room.  The hotel is undergoing extensive renovations and we were on one of the floors which had been completed. The room was spacious and comfortable with touch panel controls for lighting and window curtains.  The motion detector nighttime lighting was a surprise when first encountered, but welcome in a dark room.  Air conditioning controls were set and forget. Never had to adjust after arriving. Bathrooms were spotless and the tub/shower controls were again, set and forget.  Once you found your comfort zone it was there every time I used the shower.  In-room refrigerator and coffee maker were very welcome and used throughout our 11-day stay.

The hotel itself is barely visible from Aimens Street.  Most of the structure is well off the street and very quiet.  The hotel check-in area is directly below a DART light rail line, and the lobby shakes when a train passes, but I never heard one in our room.  The real value of the location of the hotel becomes apparent after you've begun to explore Dublin.  The hotel is located across the street from Connoly Station, with trains departing for Belfast and other Northern Irish locations.  Aimens St. is also a locus for city bus lines and the LUAS tram is one block away.  Within a 5-minute walk you can be on any of the Dublin public transit system modes.  With a Leap card, you can get anywhere in Dublin and beyond.  There are also four nice pubs within a few minutes walk as well as groceries, restaurants, off-license shops and even a laundromat. The O'Connell street shopping district, Temple Bar district, and College Green historic district are all easy rides on LUAS or a Dublin city bus. We would have been happy with The North Star / Address has just been a quiet, clean, comfortable room.  With the added benefits of the Amiens St / Talbot St neighborhood, the proximity to citywide transportation and the friendly and helpful hotel staff, we were delighted!",5,2019,08,22
219,Great hotel but has its downfalls,Stayed here for a night(21/08/19) we were put at the front of the hotel up the stairs at the very end of a corridor (many stairs) and no lift which wasn't a issue for us might be for others. The room was adjacent to a dart bridge which was very noisy after 5 in the morning. If staying here ask for a room at the back of the hotel but other than that staff were welcoming. Every staff we passed greeted us with a smile which is rare these days. Also if I wasn't with someone who stayed here before I wouldn't have been certain as to where the reception is as the concierge is clearly marked and reception is labelled the Address reception not North Star. Would stay here again :),3,2019,08,22
219,Review,"We had a fantastic time here! Staff were wonderful and very helpful with any questions we had. Rooms were great, neat and clean day in and day out. My wife and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Dublin, as it is very central to many many attractions in the city ",5,2019,08,21
219,Very poor service. Right next to train station.,"If you like being woken up at 5:30 am by the constant sound of trains going directly by your room this hotel is for you.
I was promised an early check in since I arrived from Boston at 5:00am they were gracious enough to let me in the room by 1:00pm but I couldn't get any rest thanks to the constant clatter of trains. I between trains there were construction noises like drilling and hammering.",1,2019,08,20
219,High quality and modernity.,"This is the ""modern"" wing of the North Star Hotel; the two are operated as one property.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable, with all amenities one could ask for.  The theme is high-tech, with touch buttons or card swipes for everything, even to summon the elevator.  Interesting but a bit too much sometimes.  Service was very cordial and efficient.  The location is very convenient, next to Connolly Train Station, with the red LUAS line a block away, and such attractions as the Abbey Theatre and O'Connell Street within a few blocks.  Trinity College is an easy walk across the nearby River Liffey.  The airport bus is 2 blocks away and at this point it's already gone through central Dublin congestion and is ready to hit the freeway.  A fine choice!",5,2019,08,19
219,Well looked after!,"Ticked all the boxes for me and our party. Very friendly and accommodating from all the staff I came in contact with. Even having lost ticket for my luggage in temporary storage and then locked myself out of my room! Very happy!
",5,2019,08,19
219,Great location.. World class concierge,"The hotel is great and in a wonderful location. It is across the street from the Connelly Bus/Train station for easy access to everything. The highlight of our stay was the help we received from Kiernan at the concierge desk. This guy assisted as we navigated a frustratiing expereince with British Air and lost luggage. His efforts, connections and knowledge contributed much to a happy ending to the story. He also gave us great advise and direction about restaurants and tourists sites. Thank  you Kiernan!",5,2019,08,17
219,Excellent stay here wonderful hotel,"We had a stay it‚Äôs a Fab hotel, staff very friendly, very modern and clean. We were upgraded to the facility of the premium lounge at no extra charge. Great location ten min walk from Dublin centre would definitely return here ",5,2019,08,17
219,Perfect for a short stay,"Warm welcome, tidy room, excellent breakfast, ideally located for exploring Dublin and the whole area around it like Howth and the Wicklow mountains, very friendly and helpful staff, very good value for money",5,2019,08,16
219,Visiting Dublin,"Very nice hotel with frendly service. Breakfast was very great and it was easy to travel lically with Luas and easy airport links. Room wad clean.

Other services we didn t use but gym seems to be quite good also. ",4,2019,08,16
219,High-tech for lights and curtains but design for basic room functions lacking,"The location of this hotel was very good, opposite Connolly Station and near Talbot street. Walkable to O‚ÄôConnell street, Abbey Theatre, Emigration Museum and even to Temple Bar. The Concierge was very helpful. We were given a card with which we could access the lift, the door to our room. The staff member who showed us to our room quickly explained how all the information we needed was to be accessed via the very smart tv and room lighting functioned by touching appropriate touch sensors as did the contains. If you get out of bed during the night, lights at floor level come on and so does a light in the bathroom. This will eventually turn off if you do not turn it off yourself. We got the hang of it but other more basic functions didn‚Äôt work so well, like the bath water not draining away as you have a shower and having to push the flusher button on toilet too hard. No tissues in room. Room was comfortable and quiet. Coffee machine and coffee capsules and tea bags supplied. No paper or pen in room. No directory - all information is via screen and there is a lot of useful information there - just have to navigate through the screens.",4,2019,08,14
219,Short stay in Dublin,"We stayed at North Star for our first time in Dublin. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and made our stay memorable. They were keen to help us with tourist attractions and places to see, helped us with using public transport and to top the trip off they even surprised us with a bottle of prosecco and chocolates to the room for our anniversary. They went the extra mile and booked us in for a lovely dinner which was a short walk away from the hotel. A very pleasant stay! ",5,2019,08,14
219,Beautiful hotel with Top Notch Staff,"My daughter and I stayed twice in one week as we went elsewhere for the middle of the week. The staff at North Star were very helpful and friendly.  I broke my leg in the middle of our vacation and the concierge staff were able to obtain a wheelchair for me to use during our stay. This was much appreciated. Also, the front desk obtained a wheelchair accessible room for our second stay. The only reason I gave a 4 for cleanliness instead of a 5 is because the 2nd room was quite dusty from not being used I suppose. With the accommodating room I have to admit that I didnt like how the lights were controlled with the TV remote and the pot lights were super bright in your eyes if you were in bed. I much preferred the 1st room we stayed in. However, I so appreciate the staff's assistance during our stay. They were top notch!! And room service from the restaurant was delicious. :)",5,2019,08,13
219,Wow!,The Address is fab. Modern with lots of finishing touches to the decor which makes it different. The rooms are quite large and everything seems new and fresh. The only issue being that the shower is not very powerful.  The Club room and outdoor balcony is perfect for a simple but adequate breakfast and drinks and nibbles in the evening. You do hear the nearby train but it wasn‚Äôt enough to bother us.  The staff were all excellent.  I‚Äôll definitely be back.,5,2019,08,12
219,Perfect stay! The Address,"We were made welcome from the moment we stepped foot into the hotel, all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and are a credit to the hotel. We stayed there for my partners birthday and they made it feel special even before we had got to the hotel sorting flowers etc for the room. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Dublin due to the location and especially the service they provide. My next trip to Dublin i will be sure to stay there again!",5,2019,08,12
219,Perfect Stay,"We stayed at the address hotel and from the moment we step in we felt welcome, all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I booked this hotel for my partners birthday and they made the stay very special before we had even arrived.

219,Uni catch up,"Lovely hotel in the middle of being renovated and from what they‚Äôve done looks amazing. This didn‚Äôt effect our stay as the works didn‚Äôt start till after 10. Google maps says temple bar is a 20 minute walk but we found it more like a 10 minute walk. There was 4 of us with 2 double beds which were comfy. 
Overall good base for seeing the city",4,2019,08,11
219,Car parking....,"Yes the car park is opposite but it‚Äôs certainly not close and involves dragging suitcases along pavements past broken glass and litter.  The car park is not secure and vehicles are vulnerable..... certainly a nervous walk in the dark to get the car.  

On the plus it is a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar and the room was good. If we were visiting Dublin again, and didn‚Äôt have a car, then would consider. ",3,2019,08,11
219,Amazing! Couldn‚Äôt fault it..,"Booked this hotel purely for its location beside Connolly station (we needed to get to the Aviva for Ireland Vs Italy) but EVERYTHING was exceptional! 

Arrived too early for check-in, receptionist was a ‚Äútrainee‚Äù but was very helpful! She kindly directed us towards private bathrooms for us to change into our jerseys, and organised for our bags to be kept safe while we enjoyed our day!

We stayed in one of the hotel suites which only worked out at ~10‚Ç¨ more than a standard room, it was gorgeous! Really tastefully decorated! A lovely lounge/reception area with a tv, a decent sized dressing area, and fab bedroom with another tv! I wish I took pictures but the bathroom even had his and hers sinks! The room had panoramic views of the area around, it left the room so bright and airy! Excellent value for money (Brilliant price for the second week of August)!!

Breakfast ran until 11am at the weekend, we went down around 9:30am and it was the calmest breakfast room Ive ever seen! The atmosphere was ideal for a peaceful breakfast! Staff all over the hotel were excellent and the same went for the ladies in the cellar. Huge amount of variety, even a complete range of Gluten-Free options! 10/10
 
I will be staying here for all my future trips to Dublin! Thank you everyone! ",5,2019,08,11
219,First Class Experience,"Hotel is fantastic, Staff superb couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Really modern hotel and spotless. Unlike other reviews I never heard a train during my stay. Location is excellent next time I visit I‚Äôd love to stay in a suite üòÅ",5,2019,08,10
219,Amazing and friendly stay,The stay were extremely friendly and approachable. North Star Hotel was in the perfect location! Close to all attractions. The only down side was the renovation noises but even that didn‚Äôt take away how great the hotel was! I will definitely be booking another stay with them in the future. ,5,2019,08,09
219,I don't normally complain but...,"The gentleman on reception who dealt with us at the start and the end of the stay was a credit to your hotel, I wish I had got his name. Without him I would not stay here again, but I'm putting my experience down to bad luck. The construction work which I had no idea was goin to be goin on. Was apparently supposed to be 10-5 but they were drilling and banging below our room from 8.30 both mornings. And me and my friend got a shock as we was lying in bed and two of the workers came past our window in a cherry picker style lift. Luckily I had a towel on and my friend was just about under the cover. The first room we got given turned out not too be ours, I could only be thankful that whoever's room it was wasn't in at the time, just their suitcases. And then when they sorted that out the single bed mattress I sat on sank in the middle and I had a spring pushing into my leg where it was broke. By the time I'd been up and down the stairs on numerous occasions to get a room sorted I didn't want to go again so ended up spinning the mattress round to make it sleepable, we had someone come in our room one of the mornings without even knocking whilst we was in bed, the milk and sugar didn't get refilled and when we went to use the last milk it curdled both our drinks so we cudnt have a drink either. The receptionist who we checked out with was very apologetic and gave us a free coffee and cakes and was as courteous as when we first met him. I'm sure once the renovations are finished it'll b a lovely place. But unfortunately my experience this time was not good!",4,2019,08,09

219,Concierge Martin Marhefka,"We started and ended our 10 day Ireland trip at the North Star Hotel. We had 2 concierge that both went out of their way to assist us.  At the end of our trip Martin Marhefka went above and beyond.  Mr. Marhefka helped us confirm our flight home.  A taxi was called for us and after arriving at the airport, we realized we left our camera bag somewhere.  We called Martin and he had the rooms and the lobby searched.  Then he contacted the taxi that we had and found that our camera bag was with the taxi driver. He connected us with the taxi driver and we got our camera back ... Thank you Martin Marhefka for going above and beyond!!!!",5,2019,08,07

219,Highly recommended this hotel!,Hi. My husband and I stayed in the North Star Hotel for one night. On check in Receptionist Anna dealt with us very efficiently and also so friendly. She made us feel so welcome. The facilities at the hotel were great and breakfast was lovely.Fantastic location just across the road from the Railway station which couldn't be handier. We will certainly return soon.,5,2019,08,05
219,Fantastic short stay in Dublin ,"The address is the place to be in Dublin . Everywhere is walkable from The address. 

On arrival we were welcomed by the staff who were all very friendly . A very quick check in and then escorted to our room where the young man can‚Äôt remember his name (sorry) he was from Brazil . He showed us how to use the appliances and the free WiFi  and not being over the top like some when getting to a hotel. 

The upper deck was very nice . I could see if the hotel was very busy this lounge could be very cramped  but it wasn‚Äôt and it was a very present experience . In the evening we had a cheese board and wine  hosted by The young Brazilian . He made sure all guest were happy and had a very good time .

Breakfast in the upper deck was nice but could have been a better if there was cheese and ham to go with the continental breakfast . 

The hotel staff throughout were perfect  and I would highly recommend anyone visiting Dublin than to look no further than the Address for a place to stay . I will definitely be booking there if and when we return to Dublin .",5,2019,08,04
219,amazing stay,This is an exceptional hotel with many upgrades. Everything from our check-in to our check-out was handled with professionalism. The many extras that are provided shows that this hotel is paying attention to all details. The location is close to bus routes and to the downtown corridor. Close to all attractions and the restaurant was very good. Enjoyed the 6:30 social hour in the lounge. Thanks Eric,5,2019,08,03
219,Address #1,We stayed at the Address in one of their King Suite rooms with fantastic views of North Dublin.  Excellent city centre location.  We stayed here for the night before All Ireland Hurling Semi Final.  Beautiful Hotel will be coming back again soon!,5,2019,08,03

219,Awesome!,"The staff is very friendly and helpful. Each time we stay with them they upgrade us automatically. Walking distance from downtown, right across the street from the train station and a block away from the bus and tram station. Rooms are technologically updated and are not outdated like most of the other hotels in the area.",5,2019,08,01
219,Family celebrating daughter‚Äôs 21st,A fab hotel and great value for money. Staff exceptionally polite and helpful. Rooms great as we had a family. Four ladies so plenty of space.  Just a door banging frequently when guests go through and drilling at 9.30 in the morning not great!!! No mention of renovation work being carried out at time of booking. Still would stay again and highly recommend. ,5,2019,08,01
219,Perfect as always,"Stayed overnight for a late birthday surprise for my mum and had a lovely complimentary upgrade to premier room and a beautiful gesture of cake, card and chocolates waiting in the room. Had dinner which was lovely as always and Dave who served us was very friendly along with sean and Keith being they're usually friendly funny characters. Stayed here so many times we wouldn't go elsewhere ",5,2019,07,31
219,Disappointed!!,"Upon arrival we were very impressed by the lobby and the general decor of the hotel. We had booked a family room which actually turned out to be the size of a small standard American room. Although we were squashed into the room-4 people, 4 suitcases and hand luggage, we have traveled extensively in Europe so realize that hotels are different here. Our first night went smoothly. The next day we left early, approx 9:00 A.M and returned around 3:00. That is when the problems started. The hotel is undergoing renovations and there was a jackhammer going nonstop below our 2nd floor window. We couldn‚Äôt relax in our room, couldn‚Äôt watch TV because of the noise but equally annoying at 3:00 PM our room had not been made up. Another guests breakfast tray, uncovered was still in the hallway and was not an appetizing sight. I came down to complain at the front desk and the manager overheard me and came over to see if he could assist. My thing is that if you knew you were doing renovations why put us in this room. The manager offered to move us to the other side of the building but we didn‚Äôt want to pack up just for one night. We sat in the lobby until the construction noises stopped, around 4:00. Of course no compensation was offered and might I say that I went on line to look at what other 4 star hotels were going for and North Star was the most expensive. And so here I sit in the lobby on our second and last morning until our pick up service comes for us, 11/2 hours because of the construction noise once more. Very disappointed in the room and quality for money spent!! One compliment was the service in the restaurant, especially by the young lady who served us drinks earlier in the afternoon while we escaped the noises and later again at night.",3,2019,07,31
219,"Stay over at North Star Hotel, Dublin",Business colleagues from Switzerland and I stayed overnight to met with others the following morning to conduct business arrangments. I resided in level 6 executive floor and was very satisfied at the facilitis available to me to carry out some needed preparation in a relaxed and comfortable environment,5,2019,07,31
219,Concierge so helpful,"Concierge Kieran Doherty was fantastic.  Not only did he provide great advice and directions in the area, but he also helped us to sort out our rental cars and our phones, making the start to our Ireland trip a pleasant one.  Rest of the hotel staff were also nice.  Great stay",5,2019,07,31
219,Good location in central Dublin,"We took a short stop in Dublin on our way to Belfast. The hotel was located opposite to the railway station and were the main reason to choose this hotel as we were taking the train up north. One could think we would be disturbed by noise as such but no I slept lika a baby. The room was entirely controlled by the remote control - good intentions but it it didn't work very well, unfortunately and not very relaxing. Breakfast was good and room spacious and clean.",3,2019,07,30
219,Excellent,"Very comfortable Hotel only a short walk from the River Liffey.  Close to the bus terminus too for all buses, including the airport bus.  Highly recommendable with the railway station just across the road.",5,2019,07,29
219,North Star Hotel ,"It is a beautiful hotel in a great location.  The full breakfast was delicious as was the food served in the lobby restaurant for lunch. The staff bent over backwards to help us with a family emergency.
",5,2019,07,28
219,We‚Äôll be back!,"My rating of excellent is based on the location (across the street from Connolly Station which we used several times and a reasonable walk to a a busy restaurant and shopping area) and the value. The concierge and his suggestions were excellent and added some wonderful experiences to our trip. The lobby cafe was perfect for breakfast, the service and quality were great. Wonderful bar in the restaurant. ",5,2019,07,25
219,Best Hotel Ever,"If you ever find yourself in Dublin on an overnight or holiday don‚Äôt waste any time looking for a place to stay, just go to the North Star Hotel. It suits everyone‚Äôs needs, family, couples or business.The staff are friendly and helpful, the decor absolutely fabulous and welcoming. It‚Äôs close to the city .You won‚Äôt be disappointed with your choice in the North Star.",5,2019,07,24
219,Great!,"I stayed with a friend of mine for 3 nights and we had a great time. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The room was clean, big and all in all great as well. The architecture and design of the hotel were also gorgeous. The only points to criticize would be that the elevator would sometimes be extremely slow or would go up again, even though we were already on our way down. And the walls to the bathroom are thin, so you could hear pretty much everything the other person was doing in there while laying in bed. But those are just little things. 
But overall we had a great time! Loved it!",4,2019,07,24
219,lovely hotel,Visually impressive and very warm reception when we arrived. The location wasn‚Äôt the best but for some it would be suitable to be outside the tourist spots. We had some issues finding somewhere to park as it was all pay and display but over all we would return. ,4,2019,07,23
219,Great beds and excellent service team at all levels.,"Room was located across from Executive Suite on the 7 th floor. It was very noisy. We were located in a bad spot. Beds were top notch and we are booked to stay there  again this week. 
Warning the Continental breakfast was a bit of a bust with only sweet buns being served. For the ‚Ç¨30 it was not worth it. ",4,2019,07,23
219,Nice stay,"We stayed at the Address for a week in July, and it is a nice hotel. Clean, spacious rooms (we stayed in the suite but another couple was in regular rooms and they were still spacious) with a nice big bathroom and a large comfy bed. The technology aspects of the room are neat but perhaps a hassle for older or less tech-inclined. Various restaurants and lounges are very nice with excellent service. 

We had a couple minor complaints:
The location is in an area that‚Äôs a little run-down. Definitely nothing that was a huge deal for us but something that might be concerns for others. Only a block or two to the nicer area. 
Trains are pretty quiet but they are right alongside the building. We were on the 3rd floor (same elevation as tracks) and while we slept through train traffic if you awake easily it might be an issue. The hotel provided some fans that we are assuming was meant to drown out noise and it worked fine. 
Can be a bit tricky to figure out breakfast. The full Irish breakfast is offered (but not included in room price) at the Cellar but it‚Äôs in the Northstar basement and our card didn‚Äôt work to get into there so we needed another card from the front desk. Free breakfast is a continental on the roof area lounge but left a bit to be desired. Might be a good idea for staff to explain this upon check-in since we weren‚Äôt the only confused couple. 
Gym is very dated.

Overall these negatives were relatively minor and we were pleased that we chose the Address for our stay. ",4,2019,07,23
219,lovely rooms,"This hotel is really handy for my work, and it is a pretty cool hotel, but it is the staff who make this place really special. from the checkin desk to the bar they are all so helpful - i also love the lily o'briens chocolates in the room!!!!!",5,2019,07,23
219,Perfect location,"We stayed three nights at the North Star, and really enjoyed it. Nice and tidy family room, quiet and peaceful, comfortable beds and above all lovely staff!

We had access to the residents lounge with outdoor terrace which was fabulous. There was a huge choice for breakfast & the food & cocktails in Mc Gettigans cookhouse & bar we‚Äôre fabulous.

Received a really nice welcome at the hotel and we were then accompanied to our room by a member of staff who explained briefly about the facilities and a couple of perks (complimentary continental breakfast and wine and nibbles which we both enjoyed!). The room was so comfortable, we were really tired when we arrived so were truly grateful to find a massive comfy bed, a bathtub and curtains that opened and closed with the flick of a switch. The management had even gone to the trouble of writing a birthday card and putting a nice dessert/cake in our room for my partner. We will definitely stay there again when next in Dublin.",5,2019,07,22

219,Very comfortable stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Adress. Nice big room with air conditioning. The railway was just outside the room but we were not disturbed by it. We also enjoyed the access to the lounge on the seventh floor where we were very well taken care of by Renato during ""the complimentary hour"" in the evenings. 
We also enjoyed dinners at McGettigans Cookhouse, very good food and nice service. Special thanks to Deirdre who gave us excellent service.
 We would surely consider staying here again.

219,Great hotel,"The hotel seems to have been refurbed recently, rooms and reception are great but would prefer the option to have a bath as the tub is already there - great price for the location also - we did not have time to try the restaurant or bars but they did look welcoming ",5,2019,07,19
219,Absolute Gem of a hotel,"This was our second stay at the North Star. Our first stay was so good that we were a little nervous that our second one would be a let down (sometimes that happens), but we needn't have worried. If anything, the hotel has improved even more since our first visit. The bar had a refurbishment and now has an amazing cocktail menu (we tried several!), there is a greater selection of food, and the rooms have been refurbished to an even higher standard (and they were plenty high the first time). We stayed in a section of the hotel called The Address which is beautifully furbished, and very quiet (considering our room was right beside a dart line!). Staff are helpful and the location is IDEAL for touring Dublin (city centre but still right across from the DART station). This will be my go-to any time I'm in Dublin.",5,2019,07,19
219,All aboard,"We were actually in the new section of the hotel, called The Address. This area is a ""smart hotel"" that does not yet seem to have all the bugs worked out (I had my room key reset four times to be able to get into the lounge!). It was a lovely, modern room and bath, and the staff were absolutely fabulous - prompt, helpful and very friendly. There is, however, a large however: the back wall and large window of our fourth-floor room (439) were approximately 5 feet from the train tracks, and facing a graffiti-filled brick wall. The trains ran from early morning to late night and sounded like they were coming through the room. I will say that by the third and final night I had acclimated to them. The breakfast and ""wine hour"" on the 7th-floor lounge were very disappointing. Yoghurt, granola and rolls for breakfast, and in the afternoon a bottle of red and white wine with some cheese, fruit and crackers that were decimated by the first 8 people and not refilled for a long time. I think this ""amenity"" came with our room charge in the new addition, but for rooms in the original North Star part, it was apparently an upcharge of 13 euros a day. Definity not worth that.",3,2019,07,18
219,Great stay,"Enjoyed a one-night stay on a business trip. Stylish room and very comfortable bed, which really is the most important thing to me. Liked the lounge at the top floor where you could get a complimentary glass of wine in the evening or a cup of coffee. Had a meal at the hotel restaurant as well and must  compliment there waiter who was very friendly and cheerful. All in all a great stay with quick and easy access to both airport and city, ",5,2019,07,18
219,Very pleased,"The North Star Hotel  aims to please. When I mentioned the ac was not working, the team immediately moved us to a room with a working ac . The staff is very helpful and welcoming. I was more than   satisfied with my stay there.",5,2019,07,17
219,Family stay,"I stayed at the North Star with my husband, 2 kids under 1.5yrs old and my inlaws. The hotel staff were very accomodating to supply me with a cot for my kids. Great food, great location, very friendly staff. Parking 5mins walk in Connolly train station carpark. The only thing I would change next time I stay I would book a bigger room. We stayed in a standard double room which was fine but with 2 very young children, toys, cots, and buggies it was abit of a tight squeeze.... this was not any fault of the hotel and im sure if i had asked they would have offered me a larger room. We will definitely stay again. ",5,2019,07,17
219,Good location but,"The hotel is well situated for access to the city and train station. The proximity to the train station is also a negative. You can hear and see the train while you check in and also, depending on the room you get, from inside the room. We heard and felt the rumble, while others couldn't sleep because of the noise. The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable. The other negative is that breakfast is served in the cellar which is quite stuffy and you really don't want to just sit and enjoy you breakfast.",4,2019,07,17
219,"Roomy, Comfy, and Beautiful","The rooms have enough space to stretch out, there's great internet, and delicious buffet style breakfast. We had a problem with our A/C the first night, but were quickly changed to a new room once it was brought to the attention of management. The Staff were also wonderful, especially Zharmaine who made us feel at home.",4,2019,07,15
219,"Very nice,  spacious room for the price.","Comfortable bed, easy checkin,  great location across the street from Connolly Station and other transportation options made easy. Nice restaurant, didn't eat there, but did have nightcap each evening in the bar. Went up to the club lounge, it was windy and cool, didnt stay long. Only complaint was a toliet that was slightly ajar, should have mentioned it to staff but we didn't.  Otherwise,  would definitely recommend to others. ",4,2019,07,15
219,Lovely hotel just North Temple Bar,We were visiting for a friends birthday and had a lovely time. The hotel was very close to temple bar and had easy access to local amenities. The staff were really helpful and attentive and really couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. The rooms were lovely although a little warm but the A/C helped to cool it down. Overall great stay would definitely come back!! ,5,2019,07,15
219,"Lovely Hotel, Great Staff","We arrived here as part of a 60th Birthday Celebration for my wife who happens to be a twin. We got to the hotel quite early on a Friday morning. Upon out arrival I asked about any available upgrades, which there were, so we took the opportunity to upgrade to rooms in ""The Address"" and we were shown a typical room together with access to the club lounge which includes continental breakfast and a wine hour in the afternoon.

There was some confusion later in the day when we came to get our room keys after 2.00pm as we were then upgraded to suites within the North Star area, which despite being very nice, did not include breakfast. This was very quickly resolved by George on the front desk who gave us vouchers for breakfast in the cellar as well as access to the lounge due to the confusion caused. 

Breakfast in The Cellar is very good, buffet style and plenty of it which was replenished quickly. Service was excellent. 

Concierge allows you to leave and collect luggage at any time of the day regardless of check in or check out.

I would have no hesitation in staying here again.",4,2019,07,15
219,Really lovely upper class hotel.,"This hotel was a really lovely surprise. From the outside it looks pretty average based right on the street but actually inside it‚Äôs a real treat. Big spacious rooms, all touch button controls with curtains button closing. Cheese and wine served every evening complementary and continental breakfast included. You could hear the trains from my room but not particularly disruptive. Staff very helpful and friendly. Big comfy bed which you could have a really good nights sleep in. Centrally located and a short walk into town. Really lovely, would recommend and would stay again. ",5,2019,07,14
219,"Pretty hotel, great location!","We stayed at the North Star Hotel in April 2018 for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday, our first time to Dublin & first time to Ireland! We absolutely loved it, the hotel was spotless, I paid extra for an upgraded room part of the Address section of the hotel, it was so worth it. Massive comfy bed, air conditioning, stunning bathroom, all modern high tech gadgets to close the curtains! The hotel also had a wee surprise of a couple balloons in the room as I had messaged them to let them know it was his birthday! The location is ideal, not far at all from Temple Bar and O‚ÄôConnell Street! Would definitely book again when returning to Dublin!",5,2019,07,14
219,"Great refurbishment, perfect location and everything you need","We booked last minute to stay one night after a gig. Got a really good price considering it‚Äôs location and 4 star. I had stayed years ago but the hotel has been refurbished and changed completely since. The entrance is really impressive. Collin on reception was very welcoming and was really friendly, helpful and nice. Our room was really lovely. Comfy bed, great shower and I especially loved the addition of the coffee machine, aswell as the empty fridge instead of a mini bar. That‚Äôs a great idea, we were able to bring our own bottle of wine to drink while we got ready to go out without facing any extortionate charges. The slippers and dressing gowns in the room were also appreciated. We had a drink in the bar when we returned about 11:30 pm after being out. It closed quite quickly and we could only have one drink but it was a Tuesday night so that is understandable. Breakfast was lovely, a great range to choose from and the pancake machine was a nice novelty. The staff at breakfast were great although I didn‚Äôt get any names. Overall the location for me is perfect here. Right beside the train and bus stations. A few minutes walk to all the shops and temple bar, trinity etc are all accessible on foot from here. We also got access to a premier lounge with our room which unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get the chance to use but appreciated having that option. I would definitely book here again when staying in Dublin. Thanks ",5,2019,07,13
219,Nice hotel but not exactly the best location,"The hotel amenities and service were good. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was very nice as well.
After a few days in the city, I would definitely recommend staying on the south side of the river, we found it to be much closer to the majority of the attractions and much more agreeable.
However, if you do stay in this hotel, the walking distances in Dublin city center are relatively small so it's possible even if not preferable.",4,2019,07,13
219,central location on Northside,spacious modern rooms 6 minutes walk to city centre. The business lounge is great although the outside area is dominated by smokers which makes it unusable for non smokers. Continental breakfast is a bonus. Our only annoyance is that access to wifi is limited to your room.,4,2019,07,11
219,Beautiful hotel.,"Beautiful hotel, right beside the bus and train station, rooms are very comfortable,clean and spacious, i but say the air conditioning was great and kept us all cool. Staff were so helpful and friendly.",5,2019,07,11
219,Overnight for Eagles Concert,"What a superb hotel, so convenient for the 3arena. Our check in was one of the most smooth and efficient that I have ever experienced and what a welcome from the lovely young man from Brazil on reception. Our rooms 567 and 569 were immaculate and so spacious with every convenience at hand. The use of the lounge on 7th floor added a lovely touch. Breakfast was an absolute delight with a wonderful selection and great service. As wee came and went throughout the hotel we were met with smiles and greetings from all staff. The only downside was that our stay was one night only. However unanimous decision this is our hotel for all future events at 3arena. Thank you all so much.

very special",5,2019,07,10
219,Birthday  Trip,"Very nice hotel. It was close to everything we wanted to see. Room spacious and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for food and activities. 
This was our first time in Ireland and would recommend this hotel for its mid range price  and nice accommodations. ",5,2019,07,09
219,Fantastic ,"We always book here when we come down to london. we hadn't been in over a year & half so we were pleasantly surprised at the refurb. We got a beautiful room and brilliant personal touches for my partners birthday. Cannot praise this place & staff enough. Folk may book in the "" tourist "" areas but this is well worth the money and it's a Dublin gem. Haste we back. ",5,2019,07,09
219,A disappointing return visit,"Visited the hotel 3 years ago and loved it so decided to book again however have been severely disappointed with the experience on the return visit. 

The hotel itself is very nice and well located with easy access to the centre of Dublin. However it was let down on our visit by the staff.

Firstly the check-in experience was not the best welcome to the hotel with the first person we spoke to being quite rude. Although the person that eventually checked us in was friendly but it had already soured our mood.

Secondly when we finally got into our room the bathroom had not been cleaned well. We called through to reception to ask if it could be redone whilst we went into Dublin. However over the entire visit it was never rectified.

And lastly the communication between the staff that we interacted with was very poor as on multiple occasions when booking a table at the restaurant they either got the booking wrong or not at all. And then proceeded to give multiple excuses of it being very busy rather than just apologising and moving on.

All in all was very disappointed with this visit especially after our first one was so good. Therefore wouldn't recommend staying here with the issues that we faced.",2,2019,07,09
219,Constant North Star!!,"After wonderful revamp, food and service wonderful. However with all these great changes tis like a homecoming to always see Sean still meaning the pumps at the bar and the most charismatic kind , intelligent concerige in Dublin our constant star at front of house Kieran!!!

219,Great hotel and staff,"The room was clean, and the service friendly.  Breakfast had a great selection to choose from.  The hotel was a bit too ""smart"" for me in the beginning, however, once I figured out how to turn on the lights, I was good to go!  Location was also close to the town center and near a walking/running path.  ",5,2019,07,08
219,Beautiful Hotel,"What a beautiful hotel, first class service and fabulous location. Highly recommend this hotel.

219,Fantastic Hotel in Dublin City Centre,"This hotel was only a couple minutes walk from the station and had great accessibility to pretty much anything needed in the city. 

The rooms were kept to an excellent standard, each and every member of staff were friendly and made you feel very welcome. 

Think we've found our go to hotel in Dublin now! ",5,2019,07,08
219,"North Star/The Address, Dublin Ireland.","I've stayed at the North Star in previous years and received outstanding service from all of the staff; hence my return on this occasion!  WOW what a difference!!!!  The hotel has had an extensive refurbishment since my last stay and I cannot believe the high standard of this refurbishment; the hotel is beautiful, comfortable and stylish.  We received outstanding customer service the second we walked through the door.  Everything was to a high standard and so stylish, I was amazed at the difference in the appearance of the whole establishment compared to my previous visits.  Although the price has risen considerably, I still believe you get what you pay for and I would pay again.

I would most definitely recommend this hotel to my family & friends for the future.  We have a family wedding to attend in August and I'm only sad we haven't booked this hotel again.  Our family would love it!!",5,2019,07,07

219,Great Hotel,"Took my mother here for her birthday. Hotel is excellent, staff very helpful and food lovely. Our only problem was during the night the toilet seemed to be continuously filling with water and we could hear it even with the door shut.when I eventually feel asleep, I had a good sleep in a very comfortable bed. Would definitely recommend üòâ",5,2019,07,07

219,The Address at Dublin 1,"This boutique hotel is lovely. It is well appointed in public areas and in the rooms. The hotel staff are amazing. Great service, but we were not able to stay there because of my sensitivity to fragrances and chemicals even though we had confirmed a request for a scent free cleaning of our room. Expect to have strong fragrances if you stay here. 
Also important to note is the train which literally runs through the building. This may be disturbing for some. 
The hotel kindly sent us in a taxi to another hotel which they found for us.",3,2019,07,04
219,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed at the north Star Hotel for 2 night sightseeing with my wife , this really is a fantastic hotel with fantastic staff , I read some reviews about the train tracks at the back of the hotel and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep, we both slept like logs , the staff are friendly and go out of there way to help you , would definitely stay here again and it‚Äôs well located as it‚Äôs only a 5 minute walk to the centre .",5,2019,07,03
219,best value for money in Dublin,on my first night in Dublin I booked into a more expensive hotel in a worse location. Was absolutely delighted with the North Star when I stayed there on my return. Way better location and value for money. Wouldn't look at staying anywhere else next time!,5,2019,07,03
219,Great Hotel Great Visit,Room was spacious and the bed was unbelievable comfortable. Service from front desk to the bar staff was very good always helpful and could help with ideas weather its a place to go or a drink decision. Restaurant with the hotel was also very good. ,5,2019,07,03
219,Would highly recommend,Stayed here for long weekend and didn't want stay to end. Very friendly hotel and mcgettigans the staff are 5 star nothing too much trouble. Cant wait to book another stay here dont think I'd stay anywhere else perfect location,5,2019,07,02
219,family room  too small,poorly located family room and too small for four people. view of a wall and noise of the discotheque and the casino.We appreciated the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the establishment,4,2019,07,02
219,Good Choice,"We needed a hotel for one night after a cruise and with reasonable access to airport and city, since we had an early morning flight.  We had a premier room, which was very adequate, clean and comfortable and most importantly, quiet.  The area was very convenient for our needs.  We had access to a lounge area, and although we were leaving too early to take advantage of their continental breakfast, they did have coffee/espresso machine, water, and some fruit left out.
If you adjust the AC from the night time mode, it worked better for cooling, which was important, as the day we were there, was one of their warmer days, so we had a great sleep.",5,2019,07,02
219,Brilliant hotel,"First time at this hotel but it definitely won't be my last.

Great Reception team, staff in the Cellar restaurant for breakfast were hard working and very cheerful. Food was delicious and a good selection to choose from.

The bedroom was spacious, spotlessly clean and had every amenity.  Comfortable beds, plenty of towels in the bathroom,  (soaps and shampoo etc provided). There were bathrobes  and slippers too. The room was air conditioned which was heavenly in the Dublin heatwave. There was a fridge and a coffee machine provided.

On the 7th floor each evening,  wine and nibbles were provided free of charge. On the lower ground floor there was a gym..

Really enjoyed my six night stay!",5,2019,07,02
219,Everything you would want in a hotel,"Fantastic location, absolutely amazing restaurant attached which served the most amazing food and couldn‚Äôt of helped us enough with our booking as our flight was delayed! 
Querky reception and rooms were clean and spacious my only dislike was that the aircon in 3 out of the 4 rooms was broken and with 4 women sharing a room it became a very uncomfortable place to get ready and sleep in! but i would recommended this hotel ",4,2019,07,01
219,Very pleasant stay,"The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are next to a railroad so you could feel the train go by but its very well soundproof so it's hardly noticeable.
The room itself was very beautiful and very hi-tech - meaning you get nice controls over lighting and air conditioning. 
The breakfast on the hotel is pretty standard -  i do wish they included some vegetables. We had a couple of day trips for which we needed to leave early and the hotel was kind enough to provide us with a packed breakfast.
On our last night we had a very late flight (3AM on the next day) - and the hotel provided storage for our luggage and were very kind.

Overall it was a very pleasant stay.",5,2019,07,01
219,"Smashing hotel, great location","We stayed six nights in the Address wing of the hotel. Beautiful,  large room, spotlessly clean. All the amenities you could ask for including a coffee machine.

We had bed and breakfast and the food was a buffet selection  - something for everyone,  including gluten free. 

The staff were exceptionally attentive and always helpful. 

Location is perfect for getting around the city and beyond. We will definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2019,07,01
219,Good loxation,"Had a great two night stay in the North Star Hotel. It has everything you need for a city break. Shower was powerful, bed was really comfy, safe in the room. It is only a short walk from the very centre of Dublin and its nightlife (about 15-20mins) ",5,2019,06,30
219,Great Hotel,The hotel staff was attentive to our needs and provided excellence customer service from a request for water to a the Concierge who provided tips on things to do.  It is also in an excellent location because it is across the street from the Connelly Train Station which takes one to Belfast.,5,2019,06,30
219,Overpriced,"Nice place to stay, way to expensive for the average person. Make sure you ask for a room with a view which your charged more as most your looking at a wall. Restaurant on site is pricey not a great selection of foods. For smokers there is a room off the lobby. This place is close to so many stores.....",4,2019,06,29
219,A lovely hotel close to the bus station and rail station ,"From the moment we walked into the hotel, I was happy we booked it. Courteous staff at check in especially Anna. We had to wait a few hours for our room but they provide luggage storage so no problem. We had a beautiful room on the 7th floor with access to the Club lounge. If you‚Äôre considering staying here, it is worth the little bit extra to stay in a club room. Wine and cheese every night for an hour. We met so many people there and partied way past the provided happy hour. There are many restaurants nearby that included pub food and another place that had a tapas menu. We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel restaurant because there were so many choices nearby. The high tech room with bedside controls was great. We overslept a couple of days because the curtains block out all light. The only complaint I had was service in the bar area. It seemed to take awhile to get a drink. Not a major issue because we didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time there. We also enjoyed our breakfast each morning. The buffet didn‚Äôt change much from day to day but it was sufficient. Staff in the hotel and breakfast room were very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again if I return to Dublin. ",5,2019,06,29
219,Outstanding stay,"This is a great hotel and I stayed here for 5 nights. And wanted to stay longer! The rooms are large, clean and very high tech with blackout shades which I appreciated. And they have Air Conditioning! The cleaning staff was spot on and even left the air on for us on the hot days so that the room wasn't toasty when we returned. That was very considerate of them and I hope Management appreciates their housekeeping staff for these small gestures. 

Having the club lounge was nice as a quick breakfast or a glass of wine before dinner set you up in a great mood! You can also easily walk to the touristy areas and even to Chinatown. Here is feedback for the hotel - charge a little more and beef up the lounge offerings...I will pay more for more options in food and drinks. 

The airport bus drops you off a block away and you just have to walk towards Spar and go around. The hotel is literally across from Connolly station and I guess it can get loud of the lower floors. We had no issues so I am a fan!  

An excellent stay overall and I was a tad sad to leave. ",5,2019,06,28
219,Jesse Glaubitz,The accommodations and service were excellent. The controls in the room were not overly intuitive but not a major issue. The gentleman who saw to my check out was new but was courteous and thorough. I appreciate him calling a taxi.,5,2019,06,27

Our room (670) was excellent; clean, bright and modern and very comfortable. Our only minor gripe was the bathroom was a bit dark, but that is a very minor inconvenience. 

The staff in the hotel were also excellent. From the friendly check in staff on Reception to the AMAZING Irish bloke on Concierge we were made to feel welcome and valued. On arrival in our room our TV didn‚Äôt work; we waited five minutes after calling Reception and it was fixed. All in all excellent service.

Highly recommended. We‚Äôre already planning our next trip and will be returning to this hotel for sure üëçüèª",5,2019,06,26
219,Suite room 2 meters from trains,"According to me, If you book a room in a 4stars hotel the most important thing is to be able to sleep. It was not the case since all suites are less than 2 meters from trains circulating every minute or so. Does not matter too much to have 2 TVs and a big room with a sofa if you just can't sleep. Embarrassing!!!",1,2019,06,25
219,Avoid!,"Avoid this hotel, unless you want to be kept awake till midnight and woken up at 6am by the train station opposite. The noise causes the room to shake. I called reception to ask to move rooms, they wouldn't offer anything else (they didn't even provide/ offer earplugs till I called again!) 

If you get room 102 I recommend checking out straight away and cutting your loses.",1,2019,06,25
219,Brilliant hotel with lovely staff and fab breakfast.

One room had problem with shower but maintenance attended straight away thank you.  Would definitely stay here again.  Fantastic hotel and stay.",5,2019,06,24
219,Tired looking outside but beautiful inside,"We stayed 1 night prior to joining a cruise from Dublin Port. We chose the North Start as it was the closest hotel to Connolly Station (Tip - when you exit the platform turn right and a lift will take you down to an entrance directly opposite the hotel). The hotel is a bit tired looking outside but inside is delightfully quirky and spotlessly clean. Reception staff are very pleasant and helpful. The beds are super comfortable. A nice touch is low level sensor lighting which means you can visit the bathroom through the night without disturbing your companion. 
Breakfast was lovely with a good selection. The hotel is within easy walking distance to the shopping area",5,2019,06,23
219,Great stay,We had a great stay. The service was great within the hotel and the restaurant. We ate at the restaurant twice and the food was superb and the friendliness of the staff was fantastic. The room was lovely and modern and we slept really well. Easy walking distance into Dublin. Would definitely stay again when we come back. ,5,2019,06,23
219,North Star Handy Hotel,"Stayed two nights at The North Star Hotel which was very handy for getting to Malahide Castle from Connolly station. Also a good place to walk around Dublin which we really enjoyed. Hoel staff were brilliant, rooms were comfortable would stay here again.",4,2019,06,23
219,Nice room,It's not a particularly nice part of Dublin but the hotel is excellent and the location is convenient.  The room was spacious and well appointed.  They had no problem looking after my suitcase for two days while I went north.,5,2019,06,23
219,Had a few issues,"The North Star hotel is unassuming from the outside. On entry things are more impressive lovely vaulted ceiling (railway arch) coupled with modern design this looks the part.

On arrival checkin process was slow and the room key programming machine was not working. We had to be chaperoned to our room by the bell hop who disappeared to answer his mobile when we exited the lift.

The room was modern and clean.there were good coffee making facilities
 However the iron was a health hazard, sparked when plugged in and wire needed wiggling to work. And also the toilet was constantly flushing, as the mechanism kept sticking after each flush.

We ate in the restaurant. My food was very good had the fish and chips. One of my colleagues sent her food back as was undercooked (we were not charged).

Breakfast was the highlight. A great buffet on offer with full Irish trimmings. 

Checkout was slow and another colleague got double charged for breakfast.

All in all this is a nice hotel but lacking attention to detail. It's not cheap and at that rate I expect better

 ",2,2019,06,22
219,Wonderful staff,"On arrival we were met with excellent friendly staff who couldn't do enough for you. The hotel and the rooms were beautiful and spotless. I enjoyed the roof top area with the wine and cheese - Steven was great and very professional, I tipped him both nights however our American colleagues did not and I was surprised as I had just returned from Florida with minimal 20% tips requested. The buffet breakfast was lovely however if your looking foe a fry up this isn't the place. The girls who were on hand were lovely and a credit to the hotel. My wife left a pair of shoes in the room and contacted the hotel and with a smile sent them to our home. I couldn't say anything negative. I'll be back. üëç",5,2019,06,21

219,Amazing location,"Room was very warm .... service, location and room was lovely. Just needed instructions or advice on how the air con works. Staff was lovely location was near everything. Transport was very close also. ",4,2019,06,18
219,Amazing stay!!,Extremely pleased with the service of the hotel. Very friendly staff and Male you feel welcome! Very clean and tidy. Location I couldn't have asked for better.

219,otlicno,Hotel was spotless and in a great location next to Connolly station. it is 100 meters from the bus station where you can catch the Airport Bus. hotel and room was nice.. Large comfortable bed and large room. Very clean. Everything was best.,5,2019,06,17
219,Great Hotel,"Loved this hotel.  Really clean, comfortable and stylish, across the road from Connolly station and a short walk from O'Connell Street and the main areas to visit.  Staff were lovely and really helpful.  The room was a great size with everything we needed and it was really clean.  We stayed B&B and there was everything you could want for a breakfast.  My only negative would be that it is a little expensive, but you only get what you pay for.",5,2019,06,17
219,Wonderful Accommodations and Service,"We were recently upgraded to the Address on our stay in Dublin. It was a beautiful room, spacious, comfortable to come back to after a long day of touring the city, and the staff was wonderful. My only regret is only having one night there! ",5,2019,06,17
219,Amazing hotel,"Overall a very pleasant stay. The hotel is beautiful, staff were very helpful, lovely and accommodating, very central, lovely room with very comfy bed. I would definitely recommend to family and friends :) ",5,2019,06,17
219,North star,Lovely hotel & staff. Very good location too. Sound proofing of room isn't great (can easily hear noise from other guests and there was very noisy building work outside). Food at the Cookhouse restaurant was great ,4,2019,06,16
219,Dublin Hotel Stay,"Very nice hotel with great service & convenient location. It is close to bus stops, taxi stations and across the street from the train station.  Would recomment the hotel to others who plan to visit Dublin.",5,2019,06,16
219,Incredible - an Irish Gem!,"Hotel is well located for public transport - clean, well appointed rooms - staff was fabulous.  Restaurant exceeded expectations - truly a great place to stay.  Clearly management takes pride in every space and every person.  Bravo!  ",5,2019,06,15
219,Highly recommended,"The hotel is Modern, High Tech gadgets, it was very Clean and has good location next to train station. Staff is very helpfull . I have not tried the room service. Bar and restaurant are good. I would certainly recommend this hotel",5,2019,06,15
219,Lost our reservation ,"Once inside, the hotel is secure and modern. They did, however, say they did not have a reservation for us although we had booked through Railtours Ireland in August. Eventually they found the reservation. After a full day of travel we were prepared to sleep in the lobby! The breakfast was nice, front desk staff were accommodating and told us of a nice place for dinner and music within walking distance, O‚ÄôShays. This hotel is in a very urban/busy part of town. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend walking around after dark.",3,2019,06,15
219,View from the Roof,Hotel was spotless and in a great location next to Connolly station.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The view from the roof top bar was interesting.  Our room was really lovely and very hi tech and the bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast was really tasty too.,5,2019,06,15
219,Stayed for a gig in the 3 Arena,"Booked the hotel through Super Valu breaks, so wasn`t expecting much. Got some surprise when i landed.Beautiful hotel from start to finish, quick and easy check in, room was spotless.The breakfast the following morning was possibly the best i`ve ever had in a hotel,Check out was quick and easy. Luas stop only around the corner, direct to the 3 arena and a few nice pubs close by for a few drinks!",5,2019,06,14
219,Over night stay,"Stayed at North Star Hotel for one night. The location is good, it‚Äôs a 10 minute walk to O‚ÄôConnell Street. We stayed there as we were in town to see Elton John‚Äôs Farewell to Yellow Brick Road & it‚Äôs close to the 3Arena. The LUAS runs from across the road, there are also various buses that run to different parts of the city from outside the hotel, the bus Eireann station is a 5 minute walk. We took an Uber to the 3Arena & it cost ‚Ç¨11.20
The 747 bus runs outside the bus Eireann station & it costs ‚Ç¨7.00 one way to Dublin Airport, it‚Äôs a quick service & stops at Terminal 1 & Terminal 2. 

We had room 660 on the sixth floor at the North Star Hotel. The room was modern, it had 2 single beds, they were very comfortable. There is a large flat screen TV , desk space with a swivel chair. There is a wardrobe with a safe, which was free to use, also an iron. There was a hairdryer in a drawer in the desk. There is a large window from one wall to the other, the view was of adjacent apartments, no city view from this room.  

The bathroom, was modern, but quite dark, there was a few sharp edges on the floor tiles. The shower was over the bath tub, the shower was not very good, the pressure was very low & water only came out of half the head. 

The hotel lobby is tastefully decorated, there is a large check in area, the staff were friendly & very helpful. The dart rail system runs overhead the lobby. The bar McGettigan‚Äôs is large, there is ample seating around a large bar. The bar is well stocked with spirits & there is also a great choice of bottled & draft beers. 

We booked a room with breakfast included. Breakfast offered a varied choice of food. Cereals, pastries, yoghurts, fruits, cold cuts & a full fried breakfast which is all self service. The fried breakfast was very good quality. 
",3,2019,06,14
219,"Excellent hotel, shabby neighborhood","The North Star and its connected sister, ""The Address,"" are a beautiful refuge from the slummy surroundings of this part of Dublin.  The positive of the location is that it's just a short walk to both the Connolly Train Station and the bus station.  It's also not too far of a walk from the 18th-century Dublin Customs House and the Emigration Museum, which is in a nice mini-mall.  The rooms at the North Star are quite modern, even possessing a mini-fridge, which is unusual in Ireland.  In particular, the bathroom looked newly done.  There is also a good in-house restaurant, from which you can order room service--a life-saver if you are suffering from jet lag.  We did not take the breakfast option, since it is served in a basement room that somehow seems antithetical to daybreak.  The well-equipped fitness center is also in the basement, and it was completely empty on both of our day-long stays.  I would recommend asking for a high-floor room, as the noise from the street can be quite annoying.  We regretted taking a first-floor room that looked out from behind bars at a kind of service road: during the day, taxis and other drivers would sit there, idling; at night, a homeless person slept in an alcove across the road, and noisy revellers passed by in the wee hours.  With that caveat, I would definitely visit the North Star again.",4,2019,06,14
219,Good location for Connolly Station,"Interesting hotel as it is actually TWO hotels in one - The North Star and The Address.  We had not realised that, so tried to check in at the wrong reception desk - although they are beside each other.
Good security as elevators, corridor doors and of course the bedroom, can only be accessed with the key card.  Room was great.  Large bathroom, although no separate shower.  Good amenities.  Large comfortable bed and large room.  Electric curtains.   Very clean.   We had booked the Executive Floor and had access to The Address Lounge, which was quite basic and fairly small but in good weather it is possible to sit outside on the terrace.  Wine and cheese is available each evening.  Breakfast is Continental, but that's all we wanted so no complaints.   However, we could clearly see another Lounge which appeared to me more substantial in terms of drinks and snacks.  I guess that belonged to the The North Star Hotel.   
The hotel is opposite Connolly Street Railway Station which is good if you need to take the metro, or mainline trains to various parts of Ireland, such as Belfast.   The area itself looks a bit tired but is a five minute walk to O'connell Street so not too far.  Also, it is 100 meters from the bus station where you can catch the Airport Bus.  Word of warning.  The bus driver may not have change.  He doesn't take credit cards.  You buy your ticket in the Easons newsagent inside the bus terminal, NOT the ticket machines and if there are two or three of you, you might just want to take a taxi which is a flat Euro 20 to the airport.  Bus tickets are Euro 7.00 per passenger, so do the maths!",4,2019,06,14
219,Central location good service and services,"Over our three night stay, we found the staff to be helpful, the amenities terrific and the room very spacious and clean. The lounge breakfast facilities on the top floor and the sunset drinks  were a lovely touch.",4,2019,06,14
219,Excellent hotel,"Very good conditions, location, very professional and helpful staff. Perfect kitchen, nice room with tea/coffee facilities. Very close to bus and train stations, tram lines, Convention Centre of Dublin.",5,2019,06,13
219,Concert stay,We had a fantastic time in Dublin for the backstreet boys concert that was made better by the standard of hotel that we decided to book. I have stayed before when it was just the north star but this new addition was just fantastic. Thank you.,5,2019,06,13
219,North Star Review,We really enjoyed the stay and the service was great.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  The room was spotless and the pillows and the bed made it easy to get a good nights rest.  We will stay here again when we return.,5,2019,06,13
219,Don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover,"First visit to Dublin for us. We pulled up in a taxi and first impressions were not great, the exterior of the building is very tired.  However once inside we were blown away...this hotel was perfect. The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable with smart technology throughout. We had a club room with access to the club lounge on the 7th floor. This included free continental breakfast each morning, tea, coffee and snacks throughout the day and wine and nibbles between 630 and 730. Nice nespresso machine in the room also. Bar and food was also very good and reasonable, great breakfast for only ‚Ç¨14.  Location was good easy walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go. Can‚Äôt fault it.",5,2019,06,13
219,Tyrone visitors,"we had an amazing stay at The Address, staff , food , rooms all excellent.  Location was very central, will definitely be back. The new club room offers complementary wine and amazing views of Dublin skyline.",5,2019,06,12
219,"Great location, lovely room and very helpful staff","It says it all in the title.  Great hotel.  Would definitely stay there again.  Very close to the railway station and 10 min walk from Trinity college.  Great bar too to have an evening drink at.  Staff were very very good, quickly responding to emails and very good at check in.",5,2019,06,11
219,Perfect,"Our stay was so great at North Star Hotel.
If i go to Dublin again i would definitely stay at this hotel.
Rooms are very clean , big enough.
Bathroom is clean and big enough.
We wished a silent room and hotel gave us a silent room.
Thank you so much all staff at The North Star Hotel.",5,2019,06,10
219,Shooting Star,"Excellent location for 3 Arena and pre event restaurant choice. While told breakfast was included we had to pay extra the following morning which tainted a overall great experience.
Reception, concierge and bar staff very friendly and welcoming",3,2019,06,10
219,Lovely,"Lovely stay, very friendly and professional staff. Supervisor Darius I think was in particular very helpful. I would definitely recommend to friends and family.

I would consider using North Star again if in Dublin.",5,2019,06,10
219,"Lovely hotel, but a lot of noise!","Really nice, modern and clean hotel, also staff are helpful and friendly! The area is a little bit rough, but can easily get to all the main bits in Dublin by walking or tram.
The hotel is located next to a train station, which you can hear a lot, also the walls are thin so you can hear people coming in and out of their rooms.",4,2019,06,09
219,Decent hotel,"The hotel and room was lovely. Staff very helpful. Only 1 negative is that rooms are very noisy, can hear everything going on outside your room. Hotel opposite o‚ÄôConnell station where you can pick up red tram line.",4,2019,06,09
219,Snow Patrol at Malahide,"Perfect location for train and bus. Really welcoming interior and typically Irish welcoming staff. Our room in The Address was incredible. 

The food in the bar looked fab too.

Will definitely return for future gigs.",5,2019,06,08
219,Great hotel,"Hotel was extremely clean, the service was great, the staff were so friendly and helpful and did everything to make sure we enjoyed our trip, the location was ideal and very central, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to others, thank you!",5,2019,06,08
219,The staff at the Northstar out L a warm and welcoming,"The staff at the Northstar Are warm and welcoming.  The hotel is clean and stylish .  When we come back to Dublin we will stay at the Northstar hotel , guaranteed ,  your bar staff are the best . Great location 10 minute walk into the city centre what more can you want",5,2019,06,08
219,Beautiful hotel,Great hotel so convenient to train for travel. Dart passed our window. Noise annoyed the first night but didn't hear it the second night . Not suitable for anyone not tech minded as everything controlled by touch buttons. Could have benefited from having hotel information in printed version aswell as on the TV screen as you had to turn TV on and navigate through to find all information and food menus. Ended up being quicker to look up on my phone.,4,2019,06,08
219,North Star Hotel Dublin,"Great spacious accommodation, opposite Connolly Rail station, Tram stop,  walking distance to central distance, great Pubs, shopping and entertainment.
Gym was well equipped. 
Great coffee shop, restaurant with good range of meals in a cosy restaurant/pub atmosphere.
Concierge very helpful with info and tours.  
Breakfast was great value and large variety of hot, cold food , beautiful Danish pastries and good range of fruit.

We were on a cruise and were able to leave our luggage at hotel on way back and enjoy an extra day to explore Dublin before a late flight home.",4,2019,06,07
219,Suggestion for communication training,"It is hoped that something unusually stressful had affected the 2 reception desk staff on Friday night (June 7). They were consistently disdainful in the way they answered questions about locations of restaurants and bars (both in-house and local) and for a request for map. If, in fact, they did not intend to be supercilious, they should consider additional training and examine how they come across to customers. Eye contact with customers as questions are answered is a good start. 
Other staff members‚Äîthe room escorts/porters‚Äî were courteous, helpful, and pleasant.",3,2019,06,07
219,Stylish hotel,"I was surprised by how stylish it was on the inside, is it the exterior that makes me think otherwise? I got the impression from the outside that it was an old fashioned hotel but more like an American hotel. I love the art installations, projectors running old footage on the walls, lighting is a sombre prohibition days era feel about it. Can‚Äôt fault the room and excellent hotel opposite Connolly station and Busaras. ",5,2019,06,07
219,Too much money for what you get,"Room was nice and cosy but what a disaster! Next to the railway with windows with bad insulation! I could hear every train passing!

As well the Internet in the room is not working properly! When I come to a hotel with such a price I expect full proper service and a quiet sleep!

The hotel also needs to make sure to improve the service at the breakfast!",2,2019,06,06
219,Nice interior shame about the customer service !!,"Myself and my 11 year old daughter arrived at the hotel on a Friday night as I was taking her to her first concert. To make it extra special I asked the hotel a week in advance to put a note in our room to say enjoy the concert etc.. to which the hotel kindly agreed ..when we got to the room there was no note so I emailed them to ask about it, they said they would put it in when I had gone out so I agreed .. when we got back nothing again so I expressed my disappointment ...they had put it in the wrong room ! To be fair they did give us complimentary drinks to make up for it which was nice however this was short lived as when I went to have a shower there were no towels in our room ! Needless to say I had to ask for them ..! After an ok nights sleeps ( room was tiny and very dull) we headed down for breakfast and when we got there my daughter just wanted a bowl of cereal ! We were told that it was ‚Ç¨16.95 for each of us for a full Irish to which I said my daughter only wants cereal !! No I‚Äôm afraid the computer says no!! Off we trotted up to reception to speak to a member of staff there ..I explained the situation to which the ‚Äòtrainee‚Äô  member of staff said that‚Äôs the way it is !! I then asked for the duty manager ( by this time I had wasted about half an hour trying to get breakfast ) the duty Manager took so long to come and with an already starving daughter we decided to head to spar for a coffee and muffin !!! 
The fact that I had paid almost ‚Ç¨200 for a room in a 4 star hotel and could not get a bowl of cereal is an utter disgrace and the hotel should be ashamed of themselves .. Dublin May be booming again but how the mighty fell before and the mighty can fall again so perhaps treat your customers with the respect they deserve and you may get return business.",3,2019,06,06
219,A jewel in Dublin to be sure,"Arrived at Dublin airport and went to bus / taxi stop which were side by side. Caught the 747 bus cost 7 euros which dropped us all most at the door stop of the hotel. We had booked the North Star but were upgraded to the Address Dublin 1 a newer part of the hotel complex when we booked in. Such a lovely surprise after a long flight to find room was spacious, clean modern amenities & a box of chocolates.  An extra bonus was cheese , biscuits & wine every night in the club lounge between 6.30 - 7.30 & complimentary breakfast. The location was excellent lots of restaurants, bars & a huge shopping centre within walking distance.. staff were very welcoming on our arrival and though out our stay & a special thank you to Stephan who showed us to our room & explained how everything worked.  We will definitely stay again.",5,2019,06,05
219,Stay in Dublin 1,What a fabulous hotel in the heart of Dublin. Great location for exploring the sights and convenience of nearby transport hubs. Comfy spacious rooms were spotless and staff were very helpful and welcoming.,5,2019,06,05
219,Lovely hotel,"What a lovely hotel, the staff are so friendly and go above and beyond to help you, The food is fantastic and tastes amazing, the rooms are lovely and clean and plenty of space and relaxing, The bar is amazing and good prices, cheaper than in the town at the bars
",5,2019,06,05
219,Not worth the money!!,"Stayed here for one night and the bedroom was so close to the railway track felt you could touch the trains  asked to move room and was told it was full booked reception said last train was 11pm last train was, 12.04 and first train 6am.The room itself was nice, comfy beds and pillows. Had paid for club room so went for free wine and nibbles didn't appear till 6.45pm and still waiting on the nibbles. In the morning the continental breakfast was poor for a hotel of this standard a few pastries, bread, yogurt, fruit, butter and jam no cheeses or cold meat. The location is great if you can sleep thru the noise of trains. Chocolates, coffee and water in room was, a nice touch",1,2019,06,05
219,Lovely stay,"Stayed her for my husbands birthday. It was a last min booking and I was soooo pleased that I did. The staff were lovely and really helpful. 
The rooms were clean, modern and the location was great. 
The outside looks a bit dated but as soon as you walk in you can see how lovely the hotel actually is. 
Location is great. On the Airlink route. 15-20 mins walk into town centre, just off the do Dublin route. Great! ",5,2019,06,04
219,"Great hotel, great location too.","Can‚Äôt fault this hotel 5 min walk to the centre but far enough away to be quiet. Plus rooms and hotel are modern, clean and chic.

Book direct with the hotel if you can as we got a great room on the top floor with a balcony and both got a free drink in the bar too.",5,2019,06,04
219,Dublin Weekend Visit,"Excellent location,10 minute walk into Centre,plenty of traditional bars with live music within 5minute walk.Our room in the hotel was spotlessly clean,very large rooms with digital panels for lights,opening curtains,heating etc. We paid extra for full Irish breakfast,well worth the money.",5,2019,06,04
219,Lovely stay in the heart of Dublin,"Beautiful hotel, friendly. High Tech room, great bar and restaurant. Throughly enjoyed our stay to celebrate our birthday. Set in the wing hotel, a lovely rooftop view. Couldn‚Äôt of asked for a better hotel for our stay in Dublin.",5,2019,06,03
219,Dublin first visit,"5 star hotel
Great breakfast
No complaints 
Great location close to railway and trams
Local pubs excellent
shopping was good
Very friendly for first introduction
Much to see and do.
Cannot wait to return to see the country side",5,2019,06,03
219,Interesting,We stayed in this hotel our first night in Dublin and returned to it for our last 2 nights. The first night in the old part we were right beside the elevated train and there was no elevator to our room. In the newer part we had an elevator and we did not hear the train. We slept well both nights.  The breakfasts were good.,3,2019,06,02
219,Loved the place,"We stayed in The North Star Hotel on Friday night, enjoyed every minute of it. Very clean hotel, great location and very helpful and friendly staff. 
Breakfast was most definitely first class.  Will definitely be back.",5,2019,06,02
219,Overall we ended up happy,"Our first night in room 170 was terrible, the ac was not working and the room was near 90 degrees F, 28..5 C. We complained, the ac could not be fixed and we were transferred to room 337. Other than the hassle of the move it was great, reducing our overall rating slightly.",4,2019,06,02
219,"""Overnight stay in Dublin""","Wanted a hotel close to the Ferry Port for an overnight stay in Dublin.  This ticked the box for location, However, it meant a long, slow drive through the city's numerous traffic light/bridge system to get to the hotel.  Locals may have known a quicker route. Another drawback was the lack of parking outside the hotel, but a public carpark was within walking distance at 8 Euro 50 for an overnight stay.",4,2019,06,02
219,Nice place to stay,"This is a nice hotel conveniently located near transit and O'Connell Street. The room was nicely appointed. The bed was a bit firm for me, but overall nicely decorated and clean. The fragrance in the lobby was a bit too overwhelming. The breakfast was nice.",4,2019,06,02
219,Hidden Gem,"My wife and I were out for our usual day trip to Dublin. We parked in Connelly station car park . Walked to the North Star hotel opposite the train station. From the outside this hotel looks pretty run down . We were met at the front entrance by a very smart young man Steven . He asked us if we had been there before we said no , we were looking for something to eat prior to our days shopping in Dublin. Once we passed through the entrance we were transported to another world!!! I thought we were in soho in London. An amazing entrance hall with comfortable armchairs, exposed brick and the sound of trains over head. We went to the bar and were greeted by a very friendly waiter. We had the most excellent tomato soup with Guinness bread, wonderful ambience, the Batman came over and chatted with us. I could sense they were very proud of their hotel and rightly so. The decor , was very tasteful modern and had the feel of soho house . Steven explained the roof terrace has free wine and cheese for residents. We will definitely stay as breakfast is also included. With a gym this little hideaway is ideal for a stay in Dublin. Very authentic Dublin feel. I must say it was fantastic. Highly recommend.",5,2019,06,02
219,Good times in Dublin!,"We enjoyed our stay at The North Star hotel ‚Äì¬†check in process was seamless and rooms were spacious and tidy. The location was great, just minutes from the downtown core and 10 minute walk to Temple Bar! The only thing I would note is that the gym is lackluster and equipment was dated. ",5,2019,06,02
219,Address at Dublin 1,"We booked in for an overnight in Dublin. The hotel is so convenient to the train and bus stations. We got an upgrade to a suite in the Address and the room had all the tech. Curtains s open and close at the touch of a button, it was spacious, lovely seating area to relax at and a table and chairs of you wished to eat. We felt this was a real treat for our stay. The dinner and breakfast were superb too. Definitely enjoyed and no complaints",5,2019,06,02
219,Dublin 3 nigths,This was a great hotel as far as location. Can't tell you if the price was good because I used points to purchase the 3 nights. We had a classic twin reserved but when we arrived we were told that there were no amenities in the room reserved however I know we had coffee tea and toiltries included.  What wasn't included was the continental breakfast and evening wine cheese and crackers so we were offered an upgrade for 30 euro per night which we paid.  Every morning we went for the breakfast but the last night when we arrived 15 minutes into the lounge the cheese and crackers were gone and we had one glass of wine with no refills on anything. so be aware of paying extra.,4,2019,06,01
219,Ok stay,"We stayed here 2 nights and while it was fine, it was not outstanding.  There were no elevators to our room (and we had a lot of luggage because we were on a long trip AND the airline had lost our luggage at the beginning of the trip so we had more luggage than we had anticipated)  Check in was simple and they helped us with our luggage.  Breakfast was ok, nothing outstanding.  Rooms were comfortable, although a bit warm.  When we were checking out, nobody helped us get our bags down which made things difficult.  I would say overall it was average.  Not great-not bad",3,2019,06,01
219,Fantastic,"Went with my wife for a 2 city break for my birthday. The hotel is really well situated, only a 5 minute walk to the main city centre streets/transport links. I paid for a 'room only' deal but also got complimentary continental breakfast in the lounge area plus offered free cheese and wine there in the evening. The room was spacious and bed very comfy. Will definitely return! ",5,2019,05,31
219,Very good,"Well equipped hotel, good location, friendly staff. We were given a complimentary drink and chocolates on our arrival which was nice.
Would recommend this hotel.rooms were comfortable and nicely decorated. I would have no problem staying here again. 
",5,2019,05,31
219,Excellent,Hotel is beautiful! Honestly one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in - and i've stayed in a lot! Service is excellent. Location is also excellent. I loved it so much I've booked to stay again in July xx,5,2019,05,31
219,First time customer,"I was welcomed on arrival and felt at home throughout my stay, very comfortable accommodation and lovely friendly staff. It is a very central location. No complaints! Will make it my first choice on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2019,05,30
219,2 night city centre stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights with a friend and wow, what a gorgeous hotel!! Ultra modern with touchscreen controls for lights and curtains (remote curtains were fab!!)Location was spot on... 15 min wander into Temple Bar so evenings were nice and quiet. There is a train line right outside however even as a light sleeper, this didn't wake me. Staff were friendly and professional and hotel was spotless!! Would certainly recommend for anyone looking for that touch of luxury to add to their city stay.",5,2019,05,29
219,Convenient location,Very convenient city center hotel. Good value. The rooms were recently refurbished and good restaurant as part of the hotel. Just across from Connolly train station and adjacent to IFSC a great location,5,2019,05,29
219,wifes birthday weekend,"The hotel is an absolute gem. From the minute you walk through the door you are hit with a beautiful scent/smell. Check in was quick and trouble free. we stayed on 7th floor with private lounges a nice extra. Decor was outstanding throughout the hotel. Room was great kingsize bed, massive bathroom, coffee machine and tasteful decor all added to our experience. Never ate at hotel so have no experience of the food. A great hotel that exceeded expectations.",5,2019,05,28
219,A pleasant stay,"Excellent hotel with nice and comfortable rooms, service-minded and friendly staff. The location of the hotel is also good. The hotel's location is close to the Docklands business area, Connolly Station, and the city center. 

",4,2019,05,27
219,Room for improvenent,"The hotel is quite nice and the location is very central across the road from the train station.
Staff are friendly and the restaurant is good.
Breakfast is ok but lack lustre and exactly the same every day. They do have a pancake machine which works well but the toasters are hopelessly slow and toast barely cooks. There are no omelettes or porrige and the only fresh fruit is fruit salad full of melons. No international dishes either. 
The bathroom in our room 150 was ridiculously tiny. The toilet was way too cramped and we used the toilet in the foyer whenever it was practical to do so. There were no tissues in the room. They did provide a toilet brush. The shower in the bath was so narrow you had to stand sideways so as not to bang your elbows on the hand rail of the glass wall. 
The room was spotlessly clean and quite nice but the bed and the pillows were like bricks and grossly uncomfortable. Probably the hardest bed we have ever experienced in a hotel. We would not stay here again. The hotel is quite nice but they could do a lot to improve it.
",3,2019,05,27
219,OK but...,"It is the second time in a row I get the same room.
It is quite close to the DART also doesn't have an balcony available to open and breath fresh air.
I would love to get a different room next time if possible.",4,2019,05,27
219,Nice Hotel Stay,"The North Star is a finely decorated hotel with a decent location 10 mins walk from the shops. Staff were very nice and although we didn't get to eat in the bar/restaurant as we hadn't pre-booked the food and setting looked nice. 
Room was smallish but more than adequate, the only downside being the motion sensor turning on the floor lighting at night. My arm over the side of the bed turned it on  twice and woke us up. Eventually blocked the sensor.",4,2019,05,27
219,No fresh air,Lovely stay only complaint I asked twice if we could have our window unlocked ! Second time was told they‚Äôd send someone up ! We went out all day on returning window still locked ! Was leaving in the morning so no point asking again ! A cleaner said we couldn‚Äôt have windows undone for safety ? Nice air con in room but no substitute for fresh air ! Felt very closed in sadly.,3,2019,05,26
219,Value for money ,"On the plus side:
- Recently refurbished roooms
- AMAZINGLY comfortable bed
- Rooms good sized
- Great service
- Fully automated rooms but easy to use
- Awesome breakfast restaurant 
- Requested early check in and they did their best to give us the room as soon as possible 
- Good wifi 
- Hair conditioner available 

On the minus side:
- Club lounge food could be better replenished 
- Afternoon lounge food was disappointing. Person in charge could not wait to finish the slot hour and leave
- Trains pass nearby so it is a bit noisy
- Would prefer a shower than a bath

All in all though, a great place, value for money. ",4,2019,05,25
219,Very comfortable stay.  Great location.,"North Star Hotel was very comfortable and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  
It is just a few minutes walk from the train station and about a 15 minute walk to the city centre..
We enjoyed a delicious meal in the restaurant on Saturday night and were glad we did not go out to the city centre as previously planned. We booked Sunday lunch but the menu was actually for brunch so typical Sunday lunch options were not available. There was belly of pork on offer and it was very nice. We would definitely go back.",5,2019,05,25
219,Lovely stay,"Went here for one night for my husband‚Äôs birthday. We had a lovely stay, the room was spacious and very luxurious. The staff were friendly, they left a piece of birthday cake for us in the room! It‚Äôs within walking distance of the city centre and the menus in the restaurants looked lovely. 

The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about the stay was the club lounge. It was spacious and had lovely views but didn‚Äôt offer much in terms of breakfast. We didn‚Äôt book a breakfast in the main restaurant because we got the complimentary continental breakfast with the club lounge. I emailed ahead twice to tell them that we were vegan and the only thing we could eat was the fruit salad. There was no cereal or vegan friendly baked foods. There was no bread for toast. The coffee was from a machine, which was fine but the unnecessary used of non-recyclable cup was not impressive. I had to go down to reception to find staff to ask them for soy milk for my coffee. Apart from this we had a lovely stay.",4,2019,05,25
219,Amazing!,"The hotel rooms are a real show stopper, It felt very luxurious. The bed was extremely comfy, shower nice. Nice big windows. The hotel room itself is very high tech - you can open and close the curtains with a button which was very unsual!",5,2019,05,25
219,Hidden gem,"From the minute you enter and smell the beautiful aroma, this hotel delivered in all aspects. Attentive staff, comfy hotel room and excellent restaurant. Stayed here for 2 nights on business and was impressed with the quality ",5,2019,05,23
219,First class hotel at a reasonable price,"Staff were very helpful and friendly. Rooms not large but very adequate.  Clean room, good bed, good size bathroom.  Very good location, short walk to main tourist area.  Close to Talbot Street with all the shops and cafes you need.  Close to railway and tram stations.  Short stroll to the river.
Only complaint was constant, small vibrations from nearby trains running all day. Would certainly stay there again.",5,2019,05,23
219,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,Very good hotel with great facilities and ideally placed for exploring Dublin. Easy access to all public transportation and short walks to many visitor areas of Dublin. We will stay here again and recommend it.,5,2019,05,23
219,"Great stay, as part of your group","We stayed at the North Star for two nights as part of our tour group. 
I would have to say it was the best hotel we stayed at as part of the tour.  We were given a room on ‚ÄòThe Address‚Äô side of the hotel, which have bigger rooms (which i was led to believe)
-We were given a quiet spacious room. 
-Rooms were clean
-Good location, opposite station (Tip: ask for a room not facing station or street). We had a room facing a small courtyard- it was quiet!
-Bed was comfortable, plenty of pillows.
-Curtains and lights are all centrally operated through a central key pad. 
-Wifi login is a little more secure than all other hotels we stayed in because it was per room login and password protected.
-Breakfast was in the basement, but I have to commend the staff for handling large tours groups all at one time. They did a great job even though it was obvious they were understaffed during the early morning start.

Grateful we were assigned executive rooms.
I can‚Äôt fault our stay in the hotel - great work with all the electronic upgrades!
Would definitely be coming back next time!",5,2019,05,22
219,Amazing stay ,"I am just back from a fantastic stay at this hotel, myself and my partner stayed for one night bed and breakfast and an evening meal included, check in was quick man on reception very nice and friendly, got to our room it was huge a double and two single beds very modern also, had 3 course meal each food was beautiful and a free drink was a lovely touch we were served by David and Dave they were so so friendly they made our stay even better nothing was too much for them hats off, breakfast next morning was buffet and plenty of choice really enjoyed it, the hotel is in a great location which was also a bonus. All in all we had a great trip and would most definitely stay here again.",5,2019,05,22
219,Highly recommend!,"Lovely, comfortable, and clean rooms that are modestly priced. First rate staff - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Good restaurant attached. My only caveat is that the neighborhood is a bit run down but central and within walking distance of everything wonderful in Dublin! ",5,2019,05,21
219,Nice location,We had a 3 Person room. Very much Space and nice details like a small light for the night and also a led-strip in the bathroom to find everything during the night. Unfortunatly no german TV channel available. Very good breakfast. ,4,2019,05,21
219,North Star - The Address,"The hotel is near train and tram station, however, if you are coming back from the Dublin city center it require 15- 20 mins walk which maybe tiring if you had a long day out.  The reception at night check-in  service we feels some attitude toward us . We just ask about the room to make sure we get the new wing the address side as this is what we booked and paid for it at the first place because we read comments there is old wing as well. 
However, reception guy shout out to us that they are doing us a favorite upgrade us to the new side which cost more. Seriously, we know what we paid and book for, there wasn't any upgrade and you are not doing us any favorite, please be professional and don't mislead us ! We just want to make sure we get the correct type of room we book and paid for. Thank you !",3,2019,05,21
219,Hidden gem!,"We stayed at The Address ,Dublin 1 which is still within the North Star hotel, but a touch of extra luxury. The rooms were amazing, and we loved the rooftop lounge with the complimentary continental breakfast. We felt really special which was perfect as we were there celebrating a special occasion. The ambiance of the hotel is superb, and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The location was great for us. About 15 mins walk to Temple Bar along the river, so relatively quiet. Would love to stay there again.Right opposite Connolly station too.",5,2019,05,20
219,Ireland 2019,Booked into the North Star hotel and was upgraded to The Address.  Great location.  Beautiful hotel.  Room was fabulous.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. There is a 7th floor rooftop patio where you can view the city while enjoying complimentary wine and cheese.  Highly recommend staying here.,5,2019,05,19
219,The Address vs. North Star,"We got this hotel with our travel touring company. The first two nights we stayed here was in the Address, their upgraded version of the hotel. It was beautiful, amazing, and comfortable. The breakfast was good too. There was an issue with their water, which was fixed. However, after the tour for 2 nights in a different part  of the region we came back and stayed one more night before going to the ferry. While they held our luggage for us, upon check in we were given a North Star room. This room was tiny, the bed was small and the mattess was uncomfortable -as it sunk in on one side- and the drain in the shower drained. We were on the first floor. No free water this time and we were not impressed. If you are going to stay here ONLY stay in The Address. It is also a walk from downtown Dublin.",3,2019,05,18
219,Horrific,"So I have just got trip adviser and my review is from February but I think it‚Äôs necessary as I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to experience what I did.

The hotel in itself is done out beautiful, the decor is lovely and it‚Äôs a good location walking distance to temple bar ect, the downside is when something goes wrong and the way it‚Äôs dealt with.

When I was born my grandad gave me a teddy that I‚Äôve had all my life, he passed away 3 years ago and it had his scent on it and I put a bit of the teddy in with my grandad when he was buried, we was very close so I took it everywhere with me to remind me
Of him and so I knew he was with me. It was a comfort thing. On the Saturday me and my partner went out to whiskey cocktail making I left the teddy on my bed on top of my pjs as I always do (I‚Äôve been all around the world for over 20 years with this teddy I do the same thing every time). When I got back to the room I noticed as soon as I walked in it was gone I searched everywhere it was no where to be found. I then called the manager who to be fair on duty that night was really good, after two hours and missing our dinner reservation it was still no where to be found.

The cleaner had obviously picked it up by mistake with the sheets, the hotel had none of this just kept telling me she‚Äôs worked there for 12 years and never done this, I mean mistakes happen I‚Äôm sure it was an accident but it was there when I left to go out and gone when I returned and the cleaner was the only one who had been in the room, I never once accused her of stealing it as why would she? It‚Äôs a 24 year old teddy that‚Äôs been everywhere and looked awful. The hotel were awful and wouldn‚Äôt accept that she had taken it by mistake with sheets. The next morning I was in tears, I was heartbroken all that was offered to me was a free 20 Euro taxi to the airport which I declined as then they would stop looking as they‚Äôd offered me compensation (I mean a taxi is hardly giving me back my last memory of my grandad) the manager on duty that morning was rude and wasn‚Äôt interested I assume he thought it was stupid as I was an adult. 

I chased and chased when I returned home and got nothing, they said they couldn‚Äôt find it and that no one had taken it so it had magically disappeared then. I asked for the Saturday nights money back as I lost the evening and had my whole weekend getaway with my partner ruined, we are also parents so don‚Äôt get time alone a lot. They refused to give me any money back and offered no compensation, I gave up in the end.

They lost one of the most sentimental things in my life and I am still to this day heartbroken that I have nothing left to remind me but memories and a few pictures of my grandad, this meant more than the world to me and this hotel failed to recognise this in my eyes bar a few sorrys and a taxi offer!

This was a shame but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel due to the lack of care of personal possessions but you know she‚Äôs worked there 12 years so she couldn‚Äôt of possibly accidentally picked it up by mistake when picking up the old sheets she stripped.

Ruined the whole weekend wouldn‚Äôt return.",1,2019,05,17

219,Great location and comfort,This was my first stay at The Address and I'll definitely be back on future visits to Dublin.  You can't beat the location in terms of walking around the city and access to public transportation.  The room was comfortable and very clean.  Loved the technology built-ins.,5,2019,05,15
219,Excellent," The hotel was in a perfect location and the room was lovely. What stood out was the front desk staff who helped us when one person in our group fell while touring the city.  They connected us with a doctor and made sure that we were OK after we returned from the hospital  for the rest of our stay.  The room was up-to-date and very clean. ",5,2019,05,14
219,Recommended Stay!,"We were traveling with another couple and found this hotel met our needs perfectly.  It is located near all forms of public transportation. We did walk to the places we wanted to see except for an early tour at the Goal.  Loved the location, service, and value of this clean hotel. ",5,2019,05,14
219,Fine Stay in Dublin,"The hotel is very conveniently located across from Connolly Station. The room was very comfortable and modern. It's an easy walk to the City Center.  We saw all the sites, had wonderful meals, and went to a play when we visited Dublin. ",5,2019,05,14

Hotel is across road from Connolly St /round corner from bus station / tram stop. To walk into main areas (Grafton Street/Temple Bar about 15 mins walk. Reception area is lovely,  very stylish and smelt divine!! Room was perfect, comfy bed and well laid out. We stayed on 7th floor and found it v quiet.

219,Nice and clean üëçüèª,Clean tidy and a nice buffet breakfast and really comfortable beds. Not a thing to complain about really. Lifts were a bit slow because there was only 2 but that‚Äôs about it. Shower was hot but not very powerful but still a nice room and not a bad location only a 15-20 minute walk to temple bar which is a district full of bars and pubs and where all the nightlife is. ,5,2019,05,13
219,Highly recommend!,"My husband surprised me for my birthday with a 7 day trip to Dublin, Ireland. He booked us reservations at North Star Hotel, and their customer service was unmatched. We arrived 5am Saturday from our 6 hour flight, and after checking into our room we realized our AC wasn‚Äôt working. We alerted the front desk, and after talking to Colin, he informed us that the hotel was currently full and he could not move us that night.....but to have our belongings packed so that in the morning after we left to sightsee for the day, he could find us a new room and move our things so we didn‚Äôt have to bother with it. When we returned that evening, our new keys were at the front desk as promised, and to our surprise Colin had moved us to an upgraded room in a section of their hotel titled The Address, where we comfortably slept the remainder of our trip. The concierge, Kieran, was a HUGE help to us as well. He was a wealth of knowledge about Dublin, and made our planning extremely easy and non-stressful. Can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough!",5,2019,05,12
219,Great Location ,A lovely hotel in a great location.Beautiful food and very well presented. Staff work hard to provide good customer service. Room's are clean and tidy.Complete with a kettle tea and coffee. Would stay again.,4,2019,05,12
219,Great hotel,Elegant hotel with good service and facilities. Very comfortable room and good shower. Only criticism is that it was impossible to control the temperature in the room using the control on the wall. Not sire if it was our fault or that the unit wasn‚Äôt working properly. ,4,2019,05,10
219,Totally soundproof,"Just returned from complimentary wine hour on the roof deck. Complimentary buffet continental breakfast also available there. We walk to everything. For some, a hotel on the south side might be more convenient. Comfy room. Yes high tech. Needs a soap dispenser in the shower. Could be more generous with towels. Appreciated room being ready at 8 am",4,2019,05,09
219,Comfortable and accommodating,"Recommend this hotel. Enjoyed staying at this hotel, very nice breakfast buffet and pleasent staff. Husband was not ecstatic about the shower strange concept and set up from what we‚Äôre used to, but over all very pleased. ",5,2019,05,08
219,Very clean and centrally located,"We stayed for just one night.  The hotel is very clean, lovely room.  Plenty of toiletries, tea & coffee making facilities.  The breakfast was lovely, great choice.  We stayed in the old North Star hotel a few years ago, and there is no comparison now that it's been refurbished.  Right across from Connolly Station.  We would stay here again.",4,2019,05,08
219,Over priced for value provided,"While the rooms have some decent tech, it doesn't make up for clear issues with the set up. Regular runs by the train gets old. If you're a light sleeper, you should avoid this place. 

But the real problem is that despite being a 4-star hotel, it lacks real amenities. You cannot order dessert to your room, for instance. The showers lack hot water. And the rooms don't get turned until after 4pm in some instances. The TV situation itself is a waste because there's no way to order/watch any kind of movie in the room. Nor can you move the TV to plug your laptop in and watch films on it. 

Wasn't impressed in the end, not for the price tag.",2,2019,05,08
219,Average hotel,"Stayed one night for a business trip.

The room was spacious and clean. Structure of the hotel was awkward with two hotels i one which was confusing.

Nothing to add as to service.

Breakfast served in the cellar with a wide selection and okay seating.

Internet works fine.",3,2019,05,08
219,Fantastic Hotel with Central Location,"I visited this marvellous hotel last July, with my friend.  The North Star has recently did a major refurbishment on their property. The New Foyer has now superbly contemporary interior design. 
The staff are very friendly and yet very professional. My bedroom was a corner room on the 7th floor and it was exquisitely  appointed. with floor to Ceiling windows and a balcony with great views over the city. I was also right beside the Premier Lounge, a lovely space to relax. Coffee and tea and newspapers were always available too. 
I never made it down to the breakfast, but refreshments and croissants etc was freely available in the Premier Lounge in the morning.
The North Star is a wonderful location to Dublin's thoroughfare shopping area; beside the train and bus stations; it's close the 3Arena, trinity college and many other major venues in Dublin.
I would certainly recommend the North Star, for a very enjoyable stay.",5,2019,05,07
219,"Disappointing hotel, great staff","Unfortunate visit to this hotel. Room was not serviced, air conditioning broken and the passages and lift smelt of faeces. Refurbishment work was sub-standard. Staff at desk and in restaurant were excellent. Hotel could have been suffering from bank holiday weekend blues!

We were given a fan to keep us cool since the air conditioning was not working (photo attached). I am sure this would not pass safety standards in most countries!

We ran out of toilet paper and had to ask for more (3:30 pm) and when the maid came with the paper, my wife asked if the rooms were meant to be serviced. The maid said yes and that she would return in 10 minutes to do it, which she did!

The tiling on the floor of our friends room was lifting. Just about every tile was loose. It was apparent that our room and theirs had been renovated by what appeared to be a shonky contractor.

Once again, the staff were good but the hotel was definitely sub standard!",2,2019,05,07
219,In the heart of the city,I have stayed in this hotel before it was done up. The reception was beautiful. The staff are very mannerly and helpful. The bar had a nice atmosphere and the breakfast was yummy. Its situated directly across from Connolly station so has easy assess. ,4,2019,05,07
219,North Star Hotel,"Very poor maintenance.   Air conditioning was inoperable,  no plug in the basin,  floor tiles lifting and most finishing very poor.   On the plus side,  staff were very good. Enjoyed  breakfast.   Management needs to cast a critical eye over the facilities.",2,2019,05,07
219,Wouldnt stay again,"The reception area was very impressive; the hotel was convenient to the city, the staff were friendly, and the breakfast was good, but that's all I have to say positively....
The rest is all negative.  

I was travelling as part of a tour and all our friends complained about the air conditioning NOT working. For some, the temperature in their rooms was as high as 28 degrees and they were so hot they were sweating - even with the window open.  
The staff were kind enough to bring up a kettle (as I dont like percolated coffee machines), and an electric fan (as I couldn't stand the heat in the room).  Even with the fan going, AND the air con turned off, the temp in the room stayed on 25.4 all the time.  

Yet another hotel with a shower over bath.  In this day and age that's not acceptable AND not safe.  Most of our tour were older than me (64) and some with walking sticks so they were NOT able to have a shower for the 2 nights we were staying here.  
The safety rail in the shower was placed in a bad spot.......it was in the shower on the wall, so if you were a 'larger' person, you have to shower standing sideways.  The glass panel that's supposed to stop the water going onto the floor - DIDNT, so there was a puddle of water next to the bath when I got out of the shower.  
  
The bed (and pillows) were most uncomfortable.  I was travelling solo and ALL the other hotels we stayed in so far had pushed two beds together to create a queen or king size bed, but this hotel had 2 separate beds.
  
There were only 3 power points in the room (none in bathroom) - two at the main table and one near one of the single beds. I needed to charge/operate a mobile, laptop, kettle and fan, so something HAD to be unplugged.......couldn't operate them at the same time.  If I needed the fan going I had to unplug something.  

I went out for the day and after 6 hrs of walking round Dublin I was exhausted and just wanted to have a hot shower and put my feet up.  But when I got back to my room, it was 4.30 and my room had not been serviced, the dirty towels were still on the bathroom floor, the tea/coffee items had not been topped up and the bed was unmade.  I opened to door and asked a young girl servicing another room how long it would be before my room was serviced but she didnt understand. All she understood was the word 'milk"" (I had none).   

I found out later (after I complained to reception about the room not being serviced and another lady came up to do it) that the first girl only understood a couple of words of English....why employ someone who doesnt speak/understand English?",2,2019,05,06
219,Great hotel!,"Another excellent stay at the North star hotel, made even better by being upgraded on arrival. Rooms are nice and spacious, cleaned every day and free bottles of water were left for us. Food in the restaurant was reasonable and very good! As were all the staff, friendly and attended to every need. Great location 10 minute walk to the main town,  taxis and busses outside very regularly to take you to town.  Will definitely be back! ",5,2019,05,06
219,Reasonable ,"Found the hotel very impressive upon entry, and convenient to the main hub of Dublin.  The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  Concierge Keiran was lovely and very helpful.  Unfortunately our room was not what we expected.  Window didn‚Äôt close properly which meant noise easily came through and given we overlooked a lane way there was a lot of noise.  Bathroom was very cramped and water in shower luke warm.  And air conditioner was very hot.  We also had issues with other guests on the second night who woke us up at 3am.  Staff offered me a free breakfast for the inconvenience, but I had already paid so nothing further was done.  ",3,2019,05,05
219,Very nice,"We enjoyed our stay.  The bed was very comfortable, the room was clean and spacious.  The staff is friendly.  The breakfast very good. I liked the added security of key entry halls.  The only drawback was the proximity of the railroad tracks, which were right under our window.  Gratefully the trains do not run at night.    ",5,2019,05,05

219,Great stay,"We visited as a group on May bank holiday for two of our party‚Äôs birthday. On the first night we had a few teething problems, however after a chat with a couple of the duty managers the staff pulled out all the stops to look after us for the rest of our stay. Mistakes are only human but the way you deal with them makes the difference. Fabulous service that I couldn‚Äôt fault. Friendly, clean and the beds were pillow top, so comfortable. Would def stay again ",5,2019,05,05

219,Luxurious,"A beautiful hotel with very professional staff.  Food and service were excellent. Felt totally spoilt with the top quality facilities. The detail in the room included slippers, robes, bottled water, and a great coffee machine. Good choice of music on the TV and convenient services such as the remote opening of curtains and a variety of lighting options. Very spacious room and top quality bathroom.",5,2019,04,30
219,Very annoyed by noise and open door,"I have stayed in the North Star hotel before and had a mixed experience, but I was happy enough to return.  On this stay I was placed in a room overlooking Foley street.  The noise levels were ridiculous, both from the street, and from the corridor.  I was very unhappy with the lack of sound proofing.
Far worse though was to find that the patio door to my ""balcony"" was left open.  Why bad?  Because only the previous week it was highlighted in a court case that a guest had been robbed in just such a room because the balcony door was left open.  It is possible to access other guest rooms from the ""common"" balcony.  The hotel was suppose to post warnings on the doors.  The warning sticker is tiny, and faded and the door was left open.   I was disgusted to have my safety compromised.",2,2019,04,30
219,We were upgraded,"We were upgraded to The Address upon our arrival.  It was wonderful.  The bed was very comfortable, the rooms clean, the staff very friendly. The only drawback is the hotel sets by the railroad tracks, but the trains do not run at night , so even that is not a detriment. ",4,2019,04,30
219,Good Dublin experience,"Very nice, up-to-date hotel. We were upgraded by a friendly lady at the reception desk to a junior suite and we throughly enjoyed this spacious room on the 7th floor (minor criticism: the lounge next door is hardly sound-proof). All sort of different, nice places to eat or have a drink within the hotel. Good breakfast in the basement. All in all a well-designed, atmospheric place.",5,2019,04,30

Although a notice told me to close the window at night and when out of the room, I couldn't as I wouldn't have been able to sleep at all.",3,2019,04,27
219,Best Address,"The Address at the North Star is a fabulous location, adjacent to Connolly train station, perfect for both business and leisure travellers.  I received a very warm welcome by the staff. The Address is 'THE' perfect address - the one to go to for a relaxing stay and with the added bonus of unwinding in the club lounge with a complimentary glass of wine and a quality cheese board at the end of a very busy day. Fabulous hospitality. State of the art bedrooms with touch control features. Wonderful comfortable bed all adding to a restful nights sleep the perfect remedy for a 'busy next day' with an early start. Continental breakfast in the club room is perfect for a light start but the cooked breakfast in 'The Cellar' really set you up for the day ahead. There is something to suit every palate, and good coffee too. Great Hotel - Great staff - Great stay! Quality, Quality, Quality!!!!!",5,2019,04,27
219,Nice property,We had an issue with loud customers and management took care of the problem asap. The staff was impeccable especially Irish David in the restaurant. Beds were comfortable. Hotel was beautiful and centrally located.,5,2019,04,27
219,"Great Hotel, Great Location",Great hotel within a very short distance of the City Centre. Staff very friendly and helpful. Went for a birthday celebration with the wife and friends. They left a beautiful piece of cake and chocolates in the room on arrival with a birthday card (nice touch). Only complaint is the lack of air conditioning. Set the air con to 16 degrees and left 2nd key card in so it didn‚Äôt switch off. Went out for the day to return to a room that was 28 degrees. It made for a bit of an uncomfortable sleep but with the window left wide open the room soon cooled down although noise from outside then became a problem.,4,2019,04,27
219,Excellent stay at North Star Hotel,THe North Star hotel was a perfect stay for me since it was so central to the city center and the bus stop/train station. The convenience of it location was amazing! I also found my room always cleaned up with stacked up tea and milk with is super important for me. Another great feature of my room was hot water which gave me the due refreshing i needed every time i came back from touring the city.Thanks a lot North Star!,5,2019,04,26
219,Lovely stay in the centre of Dublin,Good central location. Great hotel. Fabulous breakfast....great selection....the kids loved the pancake maker. Good concierge service.  Very friendly and helpful staff. No complaints. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,04,26
219,Nice Hotel,"The hotel was nice. They do not have onsite parking, so we drove around a little while discovering that. The bathroom lighting was a little weird. If you had the bathroom light on, it would turn itself off after a lit bit while you were taking a shower, but during the evening when trying to sleep and the light was off it was like there was a back-up light on in there that kept turning on every time you moved. So that was interesting.",4,2019,04,25
219,One night stay,"Our last night in Dublin we stayed at the North Star Hotel.  From  the minute you walked in it was totally lovely.  Our room was very nice. We had to leave early the next morning for our flight so we didn‚Äôt get the included breakfast, so the man that checked us in offered a to go breakfast and it was waiting for us when we checked out at 5 am.  So thoughtful.

I would recommend this hotel.  Walking distance to pubs, dining and shops.",5,2019,04,23
219,Easter weekend,"What a great hotel. The location was just a short walk into the heart of Dublin. 
Room was as described, very comfortable and very clean. Being late risers we didnt sample breakfast but I am sure it would have been on a par with the rest of the hotel. The staf where excelent and a friendly. We would not hesitate to use as a base again.",5,2019,04,22
219,Easter visit ,"Lovely 4 star hotel opposite Connolly rail station and close to cafes and pubs. Hotel was in slightly quieter area compared to the others in city center; however could hear the trains slightly from the station. Staff were all lovely - concierge, restaurant, lounge and restaurant - they made us feel very welcoming. We were given a lovely room near the top floors. Room was spacious and everything you could expect from a four star hotel. We had lounge access where they offered como wine and cheese for an hour each evening ; enjoyed that. My only criticism was that they could have more more snacks (nuts , crisps or olives) or cheese - only served small portion of cheese and then would realise they needed more top up again and again ... the lounge needed more tlc (plants or flowers) on the balcony as the lounge lacked a bit of the wow factor . Otherwise could not fault a lovely stay ! ",4,2019,04,22
219,Lovely Hotel,Hotel rooms were nice with good shower facilities. Location was 20 mins walk to Temple Bar but next door to bus station which was handy for getting to and from the airport. Air conditioning wasn‚Äôt working in our room and it wasn‚Äôt possible to have the window open due to the trains outside the hotel. This meant that the rooms were quite hot and this affected our sleep. Other than this everything was perfect. ,5,2019,04,20
219,Perfectly wonderful!,We experienced true Irish hospitality from everyone at The North Star Hotel. I would recommend it to anyone planning a visit to Dublin. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the breakfast was very good. ,5,2019,04,19
219,Just what we were looking for,"This was a trip to Dublin for one night with our 10 year old son to see a show at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. The hotel is very convenient for the theatre, probably a 15 minute walk. We had a very welcoming and comfortable stay here. We‚Äôll definitely come back. ",5,2019,04,17
219,Happy couple,This is a fantastic hotel staff were great room fab location suitable for all travel had no complaints what so ever will definitely stay here again and recommend to all that are going to Dublin had mint time ,5,2019,04,16
219,Great hotel!,Clean and very comfortable rooms.  It has an awesome breakfast buffet. I arrived early and staff made sure I had the room available as soon as possible.   Close to public transportation. You can hear train from your bedroom or even lobby so it may get noisy at times.  ,5,2019,04,16
219,Great Location!  Friendly Staff!  Excellent Buffet Breakfast!,"Enjoyed our stay at the North Star Hotel---7 nights over three weeks.  Room and beds were very comfortable.  Location was great and so convenient to the train and shopping, restaurants, etc. Loved the huge selection of items for breakfast (included with our room rate) which gave us a fantastic start for the day!  The hotel restaurant serves an excellent selection of delicious dishes which we enjoyed two different evenings.",5,2019,04,16

Really enjoyed my stay, the beds are amazing and very comfortable rooms, the staff are very friendly and it has a fantastic location to where i need to go.",5,2019,04,15
219,Lovely!,"In order to have good appearance, it would be nice to have eye contact with personal working behind desk, or even nice hello when you are passing it.... But hotel room was lovely, quiet, clean and spacious. Surprise was strange odour in corridor, welcomes us on the first day...The location is very good and basement restaurant was really good!",5,2019,04,14
219,North Star /Address 1,This was and excellent hotel and had all modern touches cant recommend it enough. Service was great and friendly staff going that extra mile to make you feel welcome and at ease. Also a special thanks to Irish Dave who shared city knowledge and provided excellent service in the restaurant and bars. Great location and ideal for a stay in Dublin.,5,2019,04,14
219,Great hotel for a city break,"We stayed at the North Star hotel in March 2019.
The entrance was beautiful, stylish and very clean.
Check in was quick and efficient. They even managed to check us in a couple of hours earlier.

The room was very clean and perfect for a couple of nights. It was very clean.

The hotel was within a 10-15 minute walk from temple bar. It was around a 30+ minute walk from the Guinness tour. 

The airport bus stops next to it when arriving.
When leaving the bus stop is a 5 minute walk away",5,2019,04,14
219,excellent,"staff very helpful lovely rooms ,hotel center to all of dublin town will come to this hotel again the irish people are lovely people and so welcomingthe hotel restuart food is really nice there are lots of shops pubs and bars around the hotel so not to far to walk ",5,2019,04,14
219,From MArion and Pat,We were happy with the friendliness of the staff and the comfort of our room.  We liked being served tea or coffee at the table at breakfast time and the buffet was excellent.  The hotel is near the Connolly Rail Station and the Bus Arras which made getting around very easy.  ,5,2019,04,13
219,Here for birthday,John the security was so helpful couldn‚Äôt help us enough super friendly helped us out along most helpful member of staff the checking in staff was rude and wouldn‚Äôt help us said couldn‚Äôt understand rude arrogant people,5,2019,04,12
219,desire to keep hotel guests at the cost of comfort,"the rooms are very good overall.  I would ask for a room way back from the train station because the noise of the overhead trains is extremely loud. 

What spoiled the hotel experience is that check-in didn't inform any guests on the 6th floor that the air conditioning wasn't working in their rooms.   The temperature was 28c 86f.   At check-in the hotel has an obligation to inform the guest, and given the problem had existed for two days, it's shameful to think the number of people that had to experience poor nights sleep.

Even more so, considering the error was logged at 6pm on the day of arrival and it wasn't until I returned to the room later that evening to find it wasn't fixed, and to subsequently find out the hotel knew about the problem for several days and it wasn't going to be fixed for two further days demonstrated the desire to keep hotel guests at the cost of comfort. 

A small gesture was offered to credit a bad nights sleep, which simply demonstrated the hotels desire to drive up sales and keep revenue high.  

My subsequent hotel the Clayton, heard about the problem, left a personalised note and upgraded me on arrival to ensure my stay in Dublin could be returned to one of comfort and happy traveller",2,2019,04,12
219,mike,"You may think that the trains interfered with our sleep. That is not the case. We usually sleep with our windows open so we have fresh air. We really like the duvet on the blanket, however it was too hot with the blanket on and too cold with the blanket off. Perhaps you could put a sheet under the blanket so if a person was too hot, he could just use the sheet",5,2019,04,10
219,Always Dependable,"I stay at The Address every time I come to Dublin for business. I can always expect great service and a clean and quiet, very modern room. Love the accessibility to the city and the train station, as well as the cafe and restaurant onsite downstairs. ",5,2019,04,10
219,Silviu,"Very good service. Reception staff very polite, professional. I received all the information I needed. I asked for and received and other information, public transport, places of interest in the area, etc. A weak point would be that there was no breakfast included.",4,2019,04,10
219,Great stay as ever,"A very good stay as per usual.  Very comfortable, clean hotel, great food and drinks as well as a great location for me for work. 
Staff were as always helpful, professional and happy to do whatever they can to make my stay as good as it could be.",5,2019,04,09
219,Honeymoon in Dublin at North Star Hotel,We booked travel with the NorthStar in Dublin through a travel agency and were assured it would be a comfortable stay. We booked for 6 nights and after viewing the photos on their website and reading through the descriptions of the rooms we decided to email the hotel and upgrade our room from classsic to premiere. When I emailed the hotel I explained that we had never been to Ireland before but this was our honeymoon trip and I wanted the best experience possible. The lady who emailed us back assured us that we would enjoy the premiere room for such a lengthy stay. The premiere room was described as ‚Äúfloor to ceiling windows‚Äù and most had a balcony or terrace. We paid about $300 extra to upgrade the room and I have to say I was extremely underwhelmed and disappointed.The room had very little natural light and we did not have a balcony or terrace. The first photo is what I expected because it fits the description of ‚Äúfloor to ceiling‚Äù windows and was on the North Stars photo gallery but the second photo is in our Premiere room. We had very little natural light and one very small window that did not fit the description of ‚Äúfloor to ceiling‚Äù. We had housekeeping come into our room daily and not once did they change our sheets. We also did not get fresh towels (they simply folded our used towels and rehung them). The rooms came with water vases with cups (jugs of still water were seen in the hallways used to fill the room water) but we did not get fresh water daily when they would come into our room to clean. We paid the rate for a premiere room so I would expect our room to be cleaned the way they would for a checkout because I paid for each night. They took our trash and made the bed. I have to say I was very unimpressed and would not stay there again.,2,2019,04,07
219,Weekend,"Lovely hotel , staff and the people friendly, clean place would recommend to anyone who likes historic places and stories (dublin itself) There bars and restaurants , cathedrals , taxis easy to get , hop on hop off bus to take in the sights and views pleasant people , would definite come back",4,2019,04,07
219,Stayed for a concert,"I stayed here for a concert in 2018 and didnt like the cleaness of the room. We said we would give it one more chance, they have since done up the rooms and are spotless. I will definitely stay here again ",5,2019,04,06
219,Excellent,"This is lovely hotel, ideal location, very central to everywhere.  Would definitely stay here again.  The only downside to it, is that they do not have any parking but u can park across the road in Connolly station for ‚Ç¨10.

",5,2019,04,06
219,A few days in Dublin,"Nice hotel.  Close to many attractions in downtown Dublin.  From the hotel you can walk to Trinity College, St. Patrick's Cathedral and many other places in Dublin.  There are also a number of stores, restaurants and pubs in the immediate area.  The hotel is across from the train station.",5,2019,04,05
219,Mum‚Äôs 80th birthday trip,"Took Mum to Dublin for her 80th. Stayed at the North Star for three nights. Had a great few days in Dublin. Rooms were nice and clean, coffee making facilities, fridge, safe, nice big TV.  There were small nightlights on the walls under the beds that turned on with movement, I was ok with them but my Mum and sister found them annoying and we couldn‚Äôt switch them off.  Bathroom small but clean. Shower head attached to wall and you couldn‚Äôt take it down if you didn‚Äôt want to get your hair wet ( hope you know what I mean).  We had trouble with our card keys several times which was annoying, and they were not kept near our mobile phones/bank cards so it wasn‚Äôt them deactivating them. Had to do the walk/lift to the lobby 3 times to sort them out.  Had a lovely birthday meal in the hotel restaurant, food lovel and staff very friendly, they had decorated the table for mum‚Äôs birthday. So nice.  The area the hotel is in seemed a bit run down,  it‚Äôs also opposite the train station, and only about 10 minutes walk to O‚ÄôConnell Street.  Get the hop on hop off bus, well worth it.  We stayed on for the whole route to give us some idea of where we wanted to visit. The bus guides are very friendly and funny.  Go inside the post office on O‚ÄôConnell Street, it‚Äôs beautiful - and a working PO.  We also went to Madigans (est 1916) on Amiens Street down from the hotel, it was lovely and old worldly inside, food was good too.  We only had a few days but we had great fun, and the Irish are so friendly. Go and enjoy.",4,2019,04,04
219,The Address,"Perfect spot, only ruined by some early morning noisy neighbours shouting up the corridor. Stayed in the address section which have very comfortable rooms and a separate lounge for breakfast and evening social. ",5,2019,04,04
219,The Address exceeded my expectations,"Clean, stylish rooms conveniently located across the street from Connelly train station and within walking distance of many Dublin attractions, pubs, restaurants and tour bus meeting spots. The adjoining restaurant downstairs, McGettigans was excellent.",5,2019,04,03
219,My Stay,"Very good hotel, good value for money and professional staff. 

Not really a big fan of the location as I tend to hear the sound of the train and it affects my sleep.

The rooms are well equipped and very clean",4,2019,04,03
219,Top notch Dublin,"Enjoyed a few days at this lovely upgraded hotel. Staff were wonderful, and accommodations superb. Views of the city from the 7th floor pub are lovely. Hearty breakfasts each morning and delicious dinners in the adjoining restaurant. Highly recommend.",5,2019,04,02

I really cant fault this hotel. Modern, classy and very reasonably priced. I wouldn't stay anywhere else, glad to have found it.",5,2019,04,02
219,"Good Value, great service","We took a bus tour and stayed in this hotel before and after the tour. It was clean and the service was great. We had a few minor requests to the room cleaning service and they jumped right on it and sent a manager by later to make sure all was ok. We thought a few items fell short of the other hotels we stayed at on the tour: breakfast was ok, but not quite as good as the others. There were no outlets near the bed where one might want to charge their phone and have it close by at night. The lighting in the bathroom was poor for shaving. ",4,2019,04,02
219,"Clean, close to train station ",Hotel staff friendly. Check in was quite easy and convenient. Room was ready early. Parking with the rental car was quite difficult and confusing. Room was clean. Bit of street noise but not too much. Concierge was quite helpful and pleasant. Map provided and great directions to any and all areas.  ,4,2019,04,02
219,Above & beyond our expectations - it's our first,"time to stay in North Star Hotel and we will definitely be back . From staff at reception to lovely hotel room , to fab breakfast, bar food - all excellent . This hotel is within walking distance of shops .

219,Beautiful hotel!!,"Amazing location, beautiful hotel friendly staff, lifts are a bit temperamental. Noise was not too bad, wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you are a light sleeper, rooms are well kept and very modern! Pillows weren‚Äôt the comfiest but I think that varies from person to person. 
Had a problem with a noise on the roof but staff dealt with it quickly, moving us and then also compensating us for the inconvenience. 
Would definitely stay again! ",4,2019,04,01
219,Excellent Location,"My friend and I visited Dublin for the first time in years and chose to stay here.
Originally we booked a standard room, but were upgraded due to construction work on the floor we were on.
We were upgraded to a suite - it was huge! I will say, both rooms were spotless, with everything you could need. Housekeeping kept the room spotless throughout our stay.
Reception were friendly, and the hotel had a nice atmosphere - it's centrally located so we walked most places, but is opposite a Luas stop if needed.",5,2019,04,01
219,Nice hotel & good location,The central location of the North Star Hotel is great. I could walk everywhere and there are shops and pubs close by. I had a quiet and well equipped room and the breakfast was lovely (good choice). There is also a nice bar and restaurant and a cafe. ,4,2019,04,01

219,Dublin Delight,"A great hotel, well situated near the bus stop and metro. Easy to get to from the airport on 747 or 757 bus.

219,Nice Hotel Near City Center,"This Hotel has obviously been through several renditions, The rooms are a little small and the walls to the bathroom thin, but its clean and the beds are comfortable.

Caroline is extremely efficient, polite and always smiling even at very early hours when customers like myself are in having early morning coffee or breakfast!

I hope the North Star Hotel recognise that Croline is an excellent ambassador for the hotel being in a customer facing role in a busy cafe in the hotel!",5,2019,03,29

The king-size duvet was voluminous and I found sleeping too hot without setting the room temperature rather low.",4,2019,03,25
219,Great Paddy Day!,"Finally made it to Dublin for the Saint Patrick Day.
Booked the Hotel at the very last minute directly on their website, which was rewarded with the best deal online and a complimentary welcome drink of choice, from their very nice bar/restaurant.

Had early flight into Dublin so arrived at hotel at 9 am hoping to be able to get breakfast and then wait for room as I was on crutches.  As well changing room with bath to one with a walk in shower the receptionist also allowed us to check into room early.  Very much appreciated.

The room was airy and clean and we would love not to have had to leave - the only thing I left one of the complimentary chocolates over at the coffee maker out of the sun so it would not melt and the cleaner must have thought I did not want it and removed it so unfortunately the raspberry cream was gone lol - but I would definitely return to this hotel tomorrow and intend booking again asap",5,2019,03,14
219,Rugby weekend,"The hotel was beautiful, staff excellent.  We were upgraded free of charge too!!  The view from the 7th floor was gorgeous.

219,Great hotel,"Just back from my 3rd stay at the North Star Hotel and again had a lovely stay. The staff are all pleasant and helpful the bar staff especially. The only one thing I would advise is always have proof of booking breakfast if this is the case as you will be asked for it at the basement  breakfast room even though it was approved at checkin. I think this is due to different booking sites. The hotel and rooms have been refurbished from my last visit and it looks lovely. The rooms are clean and the bed was very comfortable. We had been given a suite on arrival  and it was very spacious. The hotel is across the road from Connolly station and handy to the luas red line, great for us for getting to the 3 arena. The hotel food is really lovely especially the chunky chips. I will look forward to staying at the hotel again. ",5,2019,03,12
219,Excellent  Accomodation.,"This Hotel really looks after their Guests by supplying  really comfortable rooms with all mod cons and  great beds.The Breakfasts are served in the Cellar Room and there is always a large selection of food available,both full cooked and also Continental.The ideal way to start your Day!!!

219,Great Stay,"Great service, lovely hotel and very clean, location is good also- close to temple bar and main attractions, I will definitely reccomend this to friends and 
family. Breakfast was great aswell good selection of food kept hot.",5,2019,03,11
219,Perfect Weekend getaway,"Located a short walk from the bus depot, shops, 3 arena Temple bar etc. Staff are lovely and checkin and out was very efficient   Had a lovely meal in the restaurant before heading off to our concert. Beds are really comfortable and everything you need in the room,  well equipped gym although we didn‚Äôt use it in this occasion! breakfast was superb.",5,2019,03,10
219,Short break in Dublin,"The hotel was in a good location and the staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was fine and there was a bath in the bathroom which was great. The room was quite 'high-tech' with motion sensors to switch on low level lights if you got up in the night (we didn't find out how to switch these off). Breakfast was good - but expensive. We especially liked the button mushrooms!
It was located close to the bus station and stops from the airport bus. It was not far from the main shopping street (10 min walk). We enjoyed our stay.",4,2019,03,10
219,Excellent hotel and the staff couldn't do enough for you. If you want to visit Dublin then this is the hotel to book. Co,The North Star is an Excellent hotel. On Arrival the staff couldn't do enough and be more pleasant. This hotel is the perfect location to see and experienceaand Dublin and the Cocktails are a must in the beautiful Bar. What more can I say we had a great trip and will definitely book this hotel again. I would totally recommend it. ,5,2019,03,09
219,Great City Centre hotel,"Brilliant City Centre Hotel, with perfect location beside Connolly station & 3 arena. Pay the extra and stay at The Address for free wine & cheese at 7pm. Will go back. Very clean and cozy bed with robes.",5,2019,03,09
219,Very poor lunch visit,"I had a working lunch here recently, and it was the first time I had been in the place since it was renovated. The entire hotel looks fantastic since it was done up, and so I expected great things, only to be badly disappointed both by the service but particularly by the food.

We arrived at 12:30 and sat in the bar. It filled up quite quickly around 1:00pm and the busier it got the more chaotic the service got. It took more than one attempt to order food. We had previously ordered drinks but had to ask a second time. After we had finished our food we couldn‚Äôt get anyone‚Äôs attention to order coffee and my colleague had to go to the bar both to order and to pay.

But what really shocked me was the quality of the food I got.

On the menu there is a list of what are described as ‚ÄúMcGettigan‚Äôs Sandwich Selection‚Äù, very much presented as a gourmet sandwich selection, particularly when one of the options was an Open Crayfish sandwich, not something you see on a menu every day of the week. 

I chose one called ‚ÄúClassic Ham and Irish Cheddar‚Äù and asked for it on wholemeal brown bread. At a price of ‚Ç¨8.45 I was (not unreasonably) expecting homemade brown bread, and baked ham off the joint.

Instead what I got was brown bread which was very, very dry, and clearly shop-bought. It was one of those rectangular loaves of soda-bread you buy, which are pre-sliced into roughly squares, and presented in a cardboard base, wrapped in plastic, produced by one of the smaller bakeries.

The ‚ÄúClassic Ham‚Äù, rather than being anything resembling baked or fresh ham, was again clearly shop-bought. A cheaper variety of the sliced ham you can buy in plastic packets of 5 or 10 slices. (Think Galtee or Denny).

All in all, it was like a sandwich a mother would give a child as a school lunch. Perfectly edible, yes. But served up as a gourmet sandwich in a very nice hotel which charges ‚Ç¨8.45 for it? Absolutely not and totally unacceptable.

A very poor and disappointing experience which would make me think twice about going back there for lunch, which is a real shame because the place really looks great.",2,2019,03,08
219,Very centrally located,Very centrally located to the center of Dublin. We walked everywhere. Had a great time. Hotel staff were very nice.  Room was also very nice.  Our friends came with us and they also liked the hotel.  We would come back. ,5,2019,03,08
219,Short stay,"After having a trip away with friends I found the location of this hotel ideal, most things were in walking distance or near to hop on hop off bus or tram stops, staff were very friendly and definatly value for money, it was a lot nicer than I expected. ",5,2019,03,07
219,Excellent hotel,"I had another lovely stay at The North Star beautiful rooms, very helpful staff and excellent food. The location couldn't be better right opposite Connolly Station and easy access to the centre of town .",5,2019,03,07

219,Friendly Staff,This was a great place to stay.  The staff are so friendly and helpful.  They helped to make phone calls needed to make tour reservations and they brought us a fan to help with a warm room.  Parking is a pay parking lot not too far away and was safe.  Nearby are a convenient store with everything and pubs with friendly folk.  The Grainger and the Celt were two that we visited.  The breakfast was delicious and healthy.,5,2019,03,04

219,Amazing weekend,We booked a premium room in the North Star for a concert on Friday 1st of March and from the minute we arrived we were made so welcome by the staff especially Ana at the front seat who made life so easy with check in and was just an all round excellent host. We had only planned on staying the Friday night but we enjoyed ourselves so much we went and booked Saturday night too when we got up in the morning. We got to stay in one of the 5 star rooms in ‚Äúthe Address‚Äù part of the hotel thanks to Ana and to be perfectly honest she made the weekend so stress free and an all round great experience. I think it‚Äôs safe to say we now have our go to spot to stay in now whenever we are in Dublin. Would highly recommend to anyone and if you‚Äôre reading this Ana thank you very very much. ,5,2019,03,03
219,Very modern and chic!,"Hotel had very modern and chic decor which I loved, especially in the lobby. The restaurant and bar that is attached was very busy both nights, and it had a fun crowd. The rooms were clean with a decent amount of space. This might seem like a strange complaint, but there were no tissues. And, we had to buy water at the bar which they filled a big glass pitcher with tap water. Other than that, it it quiet and clean!",4,2019,03,02
219,Clean and location is great,"Very welcoming receptionist. Room lovely and clean. Downfall was there was a screw driver left sitting on our shelf. Pillows so hard we requested softer ones didn‚Äôt get a wink of sleep. 

Also would recommend if staying to request a room not on the ground floor- we couldn‚Äôt open our curtains as it was looking into a car park

All in all great location close to train station and walking distance to shops",4,2019,03,02
219,quite good,"very kind the receptionist, the restaurant is quite good, breakfast not special, bed ok, pillows too high, air conditioning not working perfectly: my room was cold when I arrived, and too warm at night.",4,2019,03,01

219,Really good,"Stayed here for 2 nights whilst on a short break.

The hotel is situated within 10 minutes walk from Dublins bars and shops, the bus stop for the airport is one block away and the tram station literally over the road.

The hotel it's self is very nice, modern and welcoming. All staff found to be pleasant, professional and happy to help.

Our room was modern and clean, the only problem we had was the pillows on the bed were far to hard, netherless great rooms.

The food was good, nice menu.

Would stay here again and recommend.",5,2019,02,25
219,North Star,"We enjoyed our stay with you. The room was great and we enjoyed the breakfast.   Parking for the hotel was very inconvenient, Especially since you did not have a place to park and unload your luggage.  It felt very unsafe and scary walking to and from the car park. The sidewalk was littered with trash, broken glass and a pigeon droppings.We also had difficulty getting the Room air condition to work and were hot during the nights we stayed there.",4,2019,02,24
219,Great Hotel,"I really enjoyed the hotel. This was my first night in dublin and it was a great welcome by this beautiful hotel. Lobby is beautiful and everything is beautiful decorated. The room is spacious, modern and comfortable. Even though my room faced the train tracks, it didn't create a disturbance. Staff was super friendly and helpful in every way. The location is great and I was about to walk to shopping and do some sightseeing.",5,2019,02,24
219,Girls weekend in Dublin,"My friend and I stayed 2 nights at this amazing hotel for her birthday treat and we were not disappointed.
The hotel was absolutely beautiful and surpassed even my expectations. We were in a Premier Twin room which also gave us access to a private lounge on the top floor with all tea refreshment facilities.
The hotel is in a good location and is about a 15 minute walk to temple bar , the main road for pubs and bars.
The room was beautiful , excellent beds , blackout curtains means you sleep really well and the room has some great extras including a coffee machine , bottled water and toiletries.
We had breakfast included which was amazing , huge variety of hot/cold food , bread , pastries ect.
Staff are very welcoming and friendly and can't do enough for you. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,02,24
219,Mid Term Break,"Stayed overnight with my two five year old grandchildren in a family room. Very well appointed and comfortable. Spotlessly clean and perfect in every way. Will definitely return again at Easter.
Yvonne from Belfast",5,2019,02,23
219,Nice-ish,"The hotel and bar are lovely, the staff are really friendly but we were on the ground floor and it was quite noisy at times. Also the aircon in our room didn‚Äôt seem to work so it was rather hot. The room was very clean and modern with iron and board, tea facilities, hair dryer and fridge. 

There is a taxi rank outside, Connolly train station and a tram terminus so easy access to all attractions 

I would stop again but would be asking for an upper floor. ",3,2019,02,23
219,City break,"Lovely quiet hotel just far enough out of the hub of the city. Perfect location for exploring and sight seeing with everything you could need for a luxurious stay. Lovely tasteful decor. Breakfast room was beautiful , food was great, lots of choice and the pancake maker just added the icing on the cake, lovely  touch. Room was so comfy. Air conditioning was perfect and I felt so comfy throughout my whole stay. The bed was wonderfully luxurious and comfy and maid service every day felt like getting into a fresh bed each night. Would definitely recommend. The lovely guy at reception even lent me an umbrella on the one day that it drizzled. Thank you all at North Star üòäüòäüòä",5,2019,02,23

219,Lovely! Great location!,"The hotel was lovely! Really modern rooms which were extremely clean and spacious. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from O‚ÄôConnell Street and was really handy for the airport bus stop. The staff were extremely helpful, my boyfriend accidentally left his iPad and staff have been absolutely brilliant and extremely quick with getting it posted back over for us! Would highly recommend.",5,2019,02,19

219,Nortstar Hotel,Beautiful hotel in an excellent location.  Rooms were spacious and very clean.   Food in restaurant was excellent and no problem finding us a table with no reservation and excellent breakfast also served. Will definitely be returning.,5,2019,02,18
219,Lovely hotel over a railway line ,"We stayed 3 nights. The hotel is nicely decorated. The staff are very helpful. The only thing we weren‚Äôt expecting was being above the railway line. Even on the 7th floor you could hear the noise.
The restaurant was good and not expensive. 
Premier lounge was comfortable and had complementary hot drinks, biscuits and apples. 
Very comfortable but bring earplugs.",4,2019,02,18
219,"Won""t return ","We stayed here on Saturday night. This was our second stay at this hotel. Our first stay last year was very brief and left us wanting to return to experience all the hotel had to offer. 
Unfortunately our second experience was not so memorable. 
I emailed the hotel before our arrival to ask several questions, I got no reply to the first email and had to send it again to a different email address. When I still got no reply I had to ring as I wanted to make sure I had a dinner reservation and I also wanted to prepay for the room as it was a gift.I got sorted and the next morning I finally get a reply to my email answering all questions and sending me the credit card authorisation form again. The room at this stage was paid for as far as I knew but without a receipt or the confirmation of this I wasn't sure.  At this stage I was going to cancel the room as it was getting beyond a joke that it could be so difficult to make dinner reservations and prepay for a room but then I did get confirmation that the card had been charged so cancelling no longer an option.  
I had booked a club suite as we had stayed in a club room before and I wanted to improve on the experience. The room is absolutely amazing. The smart features in the room are fantastic. The room was spotless clean. The ensuite is also beautifully presented.  The downside is you are looking straight out onto a train track and although I believe the rooms are soundproofed I can assure you it doesn't muffle the sound of the trains at all. The trains stopped by 11 pm and started back up between 9 & 10 am the next morning so this might be OK for some people but for me it took away from spending time in such a magnificent room.   

I did ask about being moved but it would have been to a club room and having paid for a club suite we decided to stay where we were.  
The last time we stayed we were suprised to find bottled water, chocolate and crisps in the fridge in the room. These were Complimentry and a lovely touch.  This time there was a large bottle of room temperature water on the table accompanied by an empty fridge. It was a pity as we thought these were lovely touches the last time.  
Our meal in the restaurant:
I'd like to give a special mention to John who was very helpful and friendly and I would say he was the most positive part of our entire stay.  I am gluten intolerant so I was given a menu where they had marked clearly the gluten free options. This wa great as sometimes it can be time consuming going through all the allergens.  We both ordered soup which was delicious and I ordered the Cajun chicken burger which was served on gluten free bread with chips.  When it arrived I checked as I always do is this definitely gf  to be told that the chips wouldnt be as they were fried in the same frier as everything else.  So they were taken away. I was dubious how gluten free the rest of the meal was so I didn't eat it. My husband had steak and chips which he said was mediocre. We both declined desserts and our waitress said it was ok  to have an Irish coffee and an expresso martini. There was nothing that could be done about the uneaten meal as the price of our dinner was included in our package so the drinks instead of dessert were a good will gesture. Putting chips that aren't gluten free on a plate of food that has been specified as gluten free is just wrong on so many levels and can lead to serious illness. It isn't good enough.  
We had breakfast delivered to the room the next morning. There was 4 cartons of yogurt with our 2 bowls of fruit. 1 slice of brown bread with no clear definition if it was normal or gluten free bread. My husband enjoyed his breakfast. I decided to not take a chance and just had the fruit.  
We had asked when checking in if we could have a late check out which we were told we could until 1pm. At 12:25 we got not 1 but 2 phone calls asking if we were checking out or did we have a late check out.  Surely this should be noted on the system? 
I asked that my issues regarding the emails be brought to the attention of the manager prior to our arrival and on check out when asked if everything was ok  I told the girl on reception the truth. She also said she would take it to a manager.  Maybe the complaints are being dealt with internally but given all the issues we had especially with the food it would be a courtesty to have addressed it with us.  
We also had a lovely young man check us into our room and he was very friendly and engaged in conversation when we met him later around the hotel. I'm sorry I don't know his name but he is an asset to the hotel. So apart from him and John in the bar the rest of the experience was very poor.  
A night away in a hotel for most people requires saving and effort to organise childminder and time away from work and it should ALWAYS be a good experience. It will be some time before we will get around to having another night away and I'm disappointed to say I feel it was wasted in this hotel. I am suprised there are so many positive reviews. We genuinely are not hard to please and don't expect people jumping through hoops for us. 

I cannot fault the hotel rooms they are fabulous but the location is the issue. ",3,2019,02,18
219,Made 40 year wedding anniversary even more  memorable,Stayed two nights in superior sweet. Staff left chocolates and desert and lovey message for us. We had food in bar both night. Food perfect. Staff very welcoming and professional. Loved it. Would come here again. ,5,2019,02,18
219,Awesome!,"Clean rooms, tastefully decorated, the staff in polite and pleasant! A great place to stay and within easy walking distance to downtown Dublin! I would go back there every time I‚Äôm in Dublin. Thanks very much for everything! We loved it! ",5,2019,02,17
219,"Relax, relax and just chill out.","We discovered a real Irish welcome and such attention to detail at this hotel. As human beings it is our nature to look for faults for we always try to improve. Sometimes our expectations are greater than what is possible. I‚Äôd read lots of the reviews and thought ‚Äú that can‚Äôt be real‚Äù. I‚Äôve discovered that it is, superb staff, unbelievably clean, well designed and relaxing atmosphere, well done to everyone. ",5,2019,02,16
219,Nice stay in the heart of Dublin,"The hotel is located just in front of the Connolly station and next to the IFSC, with a variety of restaurants and pubs nearby. The rooms are modern and comfortable with complimentary tea, espresso coffee machine and chocolates! Breakfast is good with a selection of continental and Irish breakfast options.",5,2019,02,15
219,A week in a great hotel,"This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel and it meets all expectations and on any future trips to Dublin I will always stay here
The rooms are good quality of interior is excellent, good hot water tea coffee and great staff that make all the difference
Highly recommend ",5,2019,02,15
219,Nice enough ,"We only stayed one evening and this hotel was fine for that. The reception area was very nicely decorated and the staff were pleasant. 
Once in the hallway to the rooms, the decor changes and isn‚Äôt so nice. The room we were in was a really strange shape but was spacious enough. The curtains didn‚Äôt actually draw to the middle (about 4inch gap) which was annoying and the bathroom door didn‚Äôt shut - it needs shaving off the bottom, even when you manage to force it to the frame, it still doesn‚Äôt close! We told reception in the morning, but doubt they didn‚Äôt know about it already. I also found the room very cold. 
Good central location which is perfect for a weekend in Dublin. ",3,2019,02,11
219,Weekend at the North Star Hotel ,"Me and 3 friends shared one of the standard family rooms at the hotel which was composed of two double (very comfy) beds. The facilities were better than expected with a large TV, mini fridge and even an iron with ironing board. The bathroom was fantastic with a light up mirror and extremely powerful shower. 

We dined at the restaurant within the hotel and the food was top quality and the portion sizes great for the prices. The bar is also very nice with polite, cheerful service and exceptional prices compared to other places we attended. 

The staff were all extremely helpful and were happy to supply an extra room key when one was needed. They also provided help with finding the place to get transport back to the airport and were happy to save luggage after we had checked out.

Overall the hotel is a 5 star, I would definitely recommend booking here and I will most certainly be returning if I come back to Dublin!",5,2019,02,11
219,Excellence,"From checking in to checking out , and all points in between, the service and facilities were nothing less than excellent.Ideal for both short and longer stays in Dublin. Ideally placed to enjoy the city.Already planning  the next visit",5,2019,02,11
219,"Modern, clean, good location ","First point I would make is that if you use a taxi to get to the hotel at any point during your trip to Dublin the taxi drivers don‚Äôt know where it is, ask for The North Star (next door) and you‚Äôll get there. On arrival you‚Äôre greeted by a very nice reception with very helpful staff, I was even walked to my room by the lobby staff and they showed me how the hi-tech room worked! The room itself has everything you could need and was very comfortable. It even has automatic low level lighting that will come on if you get up to nip to the loo in the night! Even thought the hotel is quite large you still feel like you‚Äôre in a smaller boutique. The view from the window wasn‚Äôt the best, a brick wall, and the hotel is literally located on train tracks. 

A point to make is that this hotel does link directly with The North Star and you can find yourself in there without planning to be. The North Star is not if the same quality as The Address and I felt the quick change in quality  made the overall experience less than it should have been. 

You do get access when staying at The Address to a lounge on the 7th floor. You get free tea/coffee/snacks etc and the views ok. 

All in all you get a very nice and very modern room in a central location in Dublin. The room itself was a little pricey and I feel the overall experience was let down by the hotel being directly linked to The North Star. ",4,2019,02,10
219,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Great place to stay in Dublin. Hotel is located 15 minutes walk from city center. Room was OK, staff was kind and really helpful, not to mention typical irish breakfast - I highly recommend this place. ",5,2019,02,09
219,Brilliant,Rooms very modern. Very tidy. Staff are very helpful. Walking distance to Dublin city centre. Foods nice and nice atmosphere at the bar. Would definitely recommend. Would definitely return of going back to Dublin. ,5,2019,02,09
219,Midweek stay at Norther Star,"Stayed Wednesday 30th January. Literally 3 minutes from O'Connell Train Station. Beautiful d√©cor and rooms just as nice. Lovely staff, nothing too much trouble. Breakfast was nice in the morning. Would definitely recommend",5,2019,02,06
219,Good Location,"I stayed here for one night, the recent rugby match with my wife. Its a really good location for any game in the Aviva, or Croke park.Just walk across and onto the Dart straight out to the stadium. The reception area itself is very nice, staff are very friendly. We stayed in a standard room,which was very clean and is a nice room, but could do with a little modernizing in places.We also ate in the restaurant and the food was good and responsibly priced. Breakfast is 16 euro PP, which i think is a bit expensive. There are some nice cafe's that do a nice breakfast nearby. O'Connell street is only a few minutes walk away, but better off to get a taxi if going to Stephan's green area. Luas stop is only 2 minutes walk away.",4,2019,02,06
219,Great hotel,"Really good hotel, the staff was really friendly and the bar/smoking area was beautiful and cosy. Only didn't like the bagging of others hotel guests at different time at night.Apart from the noise at night, everything was fantastic",5,2019,02,04
219,"Retro-fitted hotel, good location","We stayed here as one night at the opening of a short Ireland tour. The entrance is only a sidewalk-width from the street. There is no drive, or cutout for buses or cars to stop. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We did a short walking tour of the area while our room was being prepared. To get to the room, you had to use your room key to get into the hallway where the elevator was, then to get into the room. The room was nice enough and comfortable. The bathtub was the extremely tall version that you often find in Europe. They are very difficult for me to get in and out of because of the height. Our tour hosted dinner that evening in the hotel. The food was okay, but it took an eternity to complete!  Since most of us had just arrived from an overnight flight, we were falling asleep at the table! If you wanted an alcoholic beverage, you had to go to a bar separate from the restaurant area to purchase it and bring it back to the restaurant yourself. Breakfast was provided as part of our tour. There was a nice selection and plenty of options. We were finished with our breakfast before we got coffee, though.",3,2019,02,04
219,Lovely hotel,"A lovely hotel. Allowed us to check in early, complimentary upgrade to the premier room. We bought the breakfast which was pretty good. Only thing I found disappointing was the hairdryer.. it‚Äôs top setting very slow and was taking ages to dry my hair and eventually conked out. I phoned to reception for another hairdryer which didn‚Äôt arrive. Thankfully after a little wait the hairdryer went back on, but I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to head out that morning! The hotel was very central in Dublin, everything is within walking distance and there‚Äôs a lot of easy access to buses and trains. Would definitely stay here again if I was to return to Dublin. ",4,2019,02,03
219,Very Good Hotel in City Centre,"This is a very nice hotel in Dublin city centre. Its in a great location for Dublin city tours, shopping, Temple bar, etc. The bedroom as large and the beds were very comfy. The shower was very good and powerfull. The hotel is ideal for a weekend away.",5,2019,02,03
219,Fabulous start to finish,"I booked a surprise for my husbands birthday, and we were absolutely blown away all weekend.  We arrived at the hotel at 10am and asked if we could drop our bags, only to be told if we wait 30 minutes, we could check into our room.  Imagine that, having your room before 11am.   That was an amazing treat in itself.  Once in our room, we were very pleased with the finish of it.  (The bathroom door did have some dink‚Äôs on the back of it, but that was the only negative about the room).  The bed was very comfortable, we had a balcony too, which was nice to get some fresh air on.   The hotel were kind enough to leave a card and chocolates for my husbands birthday too.  Another great touch.  
All the staff that we encountered were lovely! And very helpful too.  
We are in both the restaurant and the parlour, both very reasonably priced and delicious. 
The hotel is within walking distance of Temple Bar and Grafton Street, it took us around 15 mins to get to either, but it was quite nice to be able to dip in and out of the bustle as we pleased.  We got the 747 bus from the airport which was 7‚Ç¨ each, very easy to do.  Our return journey in the taxi was 20‚Ç¨. 
We did have breakfast in with our booking, and that was a really lovely start to our day.  Worth adding it on. 
I will 100% stay at the hotel again.  ",5,2019,02,03
219,Great stay and fantastic weekend,We stayed at the North Star hotel for the weekend during the Dublin trad fest . The hotel is contemporary and modern with a great reception area which is located within an old beautifully lit railway arch . The bar and restaurant are set just off the reception and have a warm and cosy feeling . Staff are welcoming and friendly and the rooms are great . We would definitely stay here again . ,5,2019,02,02
219,Awful experience,"At first glance, the hotel looked very nice by the upscale vibe of a beautiful old Dublin hotel. 

However, after getting settled in the room (not the cheapest - one that really promised to be nice), the experience completely changed: the heating was ""broken"" (we came in the winter), and the shower hardly warmed up.

We went to the concierge desk to see if we could get moved to a different room, at which point we talked with the trainee Thana, and there we had yet another bad experience: she was extremely rude showing superiority at all times, speaking in a high volume, not letting us adequately explain what was happening and implying that we did not know how to use a thermostat - she even said she'd get that fixed by sending someone to teach us (although we live in Canada); very disappointing.

Once a second person verified that the room indeed had problems, we finally got moved to a different one. At this moment, our hopes went pretty high; soon to go down again.

After settling in the new room, some surprises:
- the shower was warm, but it made *so much* noise,
- although the thermostat would work this time, the room would just not get heated enough, and
- the new breakfast (offered in something called ""Club Lounge,"" not the regular breakfast place) was very poor - no variety, milk, or eggs.

In the end, we spent the whole stay in a room that was not adequately heated during the winter, had poor breakfasts, and the misfortune of dealing with a rude person from the staff. The good side was that the location is pretty good, and the hotel is very clean and organized.",1,2019,02,01
219,Amazing experience,"Spent an amazing 4 nights here whilst visiting Dublin, across the road from Connolly station and round the corner from the bus station. The room was completely soundproof and we were shocked we weren‚Äôt affected by the trains. The room was made up very morning and the staff were all friendly and amazing. We had dinner on the first night and breakfast on the last day as we wanted to explore and both could not be beat. 15 minute walk from the temple bar and 10 minutes away from all the shops! We definitely be returning!!",5,2019,02,01
219,Business Stay at North Star,"Excellent stay, check was very efficient, the reception is amazing.  I was in an Executive room which was great, everything I needed.  Had dinner in the Bar which was lovely.   Location was perfect for me as I was getting the train the next day from Connolly Station.  Room was totally sound proof. Overall a great stay and I look forward to going back.",5,2019,01,31
219,Mrs Driscoll,"What a lovely hotel. The staff were so friendly, polite and helpful.
We got up graded for free to a huge room by the lovely receptionist called Ana. We also got access to floor 7 where there was a room with tea, coffee hot chocolate and biscuits all for free.
The Hotel itself was very clean and quite central for everything. It was about a 10 minute walk to Grafton street, and about a 20 minute walk to Temple bar. 
We would highly recommend this hotel.
We will be back soon. Thankyou for making our stay so perfect",5,2019,01,31
219,Short but flawless stay,We only stayed over one night on our way to Belfast but I was very impressed. From the minute you walk in the door the front desk staff is ready to help you- before you know it you are checked in and someone is walking you to your room to explain to you how to make the lights and curtains work. It's very nice. The rooms are incredibly comfortable- Big soft beds and Showers with good pressure and tub if you want to soak. I would stay again.,5,2019,01,30
219,Great value for money,Went on a little trip to Dublin to explore the city. Great value for money. Would recommend a visit to the hotel restaurant - really nice food. Staff were helpful. Room was clean. Beds were comfy. Would recommend to friends and fam,5,2019,01,29

219,Perfect location,This hotel is in a great location and makes it very easy for yo to get around Dublin.  One of the closest sites is the Jeannie Johnson famine ship.  The hotel restaurant is quite good.  Had the Irish stew which was delicious.  The room and its amenities are great.  Very clean and the staff is attentive to all of your needs.,5,2019,01,28
219,Fantastic hotel,Beautiful hotel very modern and clean. Staff are so friendly and the hotel is 10 min walk to temple bar. We got a free upgrade which was a lovely treat the robes and slippers were a nice little extra too. Definetly recommend this hotel we will be booking again ,5,2019,01,28
219,Faultless experience,"My boyfriend and I visited Dublin for the weekend as it was his birthday and the hotel didn‚Äôt disappoint. Photos don‚Äôt do it the justice it deserves. Staff were really lovely and the rooms have everything you need. The location is perfect as well, maybe a little far for some people but we enjoyed the walk to Temple Bar, Guiness Storehouse etc. Thank you for making our trip so pleasant! ",5,2019,01,28
219,My stay for 1 week,"Good location near shopping street. A bit noisy at times but comfy bed with many pillow options.Clean and tidy, good breakfast. Nica athmosphere at the restaurant but the foos there a bit tasteless. Nice staff.",4,2019,01,28
219,Great Hotel but Spotty WiFi,"Everything about this hotel was really good. From the location of the hotel to the staff who worked there. My sole complaint about the hotel was the spotty WiFi reception. It was clear that the WiFi had a strong signal in the main lobby; however, that signal became weaker and unstable once getting to the rooms. Had the WiFi been strong and consistent, I would've been completely satisfied. ",4,2019,01,27
219,Value for money,Very customer focussed staff especially Owen the Manager was terrific in his commitment to serve the customer overall very happy with the service & would come back again liked the location & the amenities nice quaint hotel McgetiGans pub was superb in their range of drinks & service was fantastic ,4,2019,01,26
219,Great hotel,"The first thing we noticed as we entered the hotel was a delightful aroma from the candles. Check in was efficient, the room fabulous ( comfy bed, good pillows, well appointed bathroom) and a fridge. Location ideal as the 747 coach from the airport drops off 50 yeards from the hotel. ",5,2019,01,23
219,Birthday trip to Dublin! ,"Had a lovely time during our weekend here. Hotel lobby/ reception area is gorgeous, and staff very helpful and very polite! The rooms were okay, very clean but a little basic compared to the lobby area! Breakfast was quite expensive and as a vegan not a lot of choice! They did have soya milk which you asked for, I didn‚Äôt ask if any further vegan food options as I don‚Äôt like to make a fuss! Would definitely stay again. Premier lounge was nice extra with free tea/ coffee! ",4,2019,01,22
219,Amazing hotel pity about the trains and neighbourhood,"The hotel itself is amazing, very modern, friendly staff, nice food. Trains start very early in the morning and can be heard. You would need to take care walking around the area, lots of less than desirable people around at night.",4,2019,01,22
219,Good location,"Excellent location. Rooftop club house is gorgeous, free water and hot beverages. Rooms are gorgeous, decor was lovely and very clean. 

Only downside was their luggage storage room is very disorganised and staff had to ask us to come in and help them. I thought it might have been easier if they turned on a light and put them in numerical order.",4,2019,01,21
219,Very pleasant stay,"I checked in on the 1st January and was greeted by a very friendly receptionist. She was very knowledgeable and gave me great advice on where to go for food as well as what facilities the hotel offered. Staying on the 5th floor my room was very spacious, clean and cozy. The beds are very comfortable and I‚Äôve never had such a pleasant stay anywhere in my life. To all the staff thank you for having me and I would highly recommend any tourists or visitors to stay here as you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,01,15
219,Just booked a return visit,"I stayed at this hotel last April and have just rebooked for next month so that reminded me to write a review.

It‚Äôs a really great choice. Excellent value, lovely staff, a nice property that‚Äôs well looked after and the foods good to. The express bus from the airport drops you at the door so don‚Äôt waste your money on a taxi. It‚Äôs a ten minute stroll to O‚ÄôConnell St and the DART/train station is opposite so it‚Äôs a brilliant travel location. 

Highly recommend it and very fairly priced.

219,We were so happy with the service we received.,"Would like to say a massive thank you to the staff at the address hotel! The service we received was impeccable. 
My mum kindly gave us a voucher for our anniversary on Saturday. We travelled from Cork not knowing what to expect but we were delighted to be staying in Dublin. 

We stayed in the club suite. We were welcomed with box's of chocolates! The room was large, spacious and comfortable. The bed and shower were both amazing!We loved the lounge area!
  Our room was very high tech! To be able to open your curtains with a tip of a finger was something we never expected; or to control which lights we wanted on,to control a thermostat at the touch of a finger , literally everything in this hotel is right at your fingertips.

The staff deserve a great credit they are the main reason this review exists. They made us feel so welcome, relaxed and at home. We were always greeted with a smile at front desk.
 Andrew, the porter who showed us to our room was very friendly .We were made feel welcome right from the beginning. 

As an over all, this hotel deserves five and a half gold stars!

Would like to say a big thank you from us!
We will definitely be back again.",5,2019,01,13
219,Business in the IFSC,"Much better than the usual hotel I was staying at for business in Dublin 1, when this was not a choice.  Good restaurant with room service available 24 hours.  I look forward to trying the bar next time (when not on January detox)!",5,2019,01,13
219,"Fantastic service and staff, beautiful appointed rooms and facilities. Views lovely.","Our stay at the Address section of the North Star Hotel was excellent. We were given a beautiful room with great views over the Dublin rooftops. We also had access to a lounge with coffee/tea/ sparkling water and snacks which was a very enjoyable touch as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. Additionally, in the evening they offered us wine and cheese in the lounge which was really nice..... The staff at the North Star were absolutely great from the manager, the reception staff, and the restaurant staff. Everyone was lovely and very professional. We highly recommend staying at the North Star, we had a wonderful time. Thank you.",5,2019,01,12
219,Great Hotel,"This is the second time we have stayed at the North Star. Each time we have been we have been so impressed at the friendly efficient service provided by the staff (able to check in early on both occasions) the rooms are clean & well equipped.

219,Excellent location and great room,"Went for New Year 2018/19 and the location was brilliant for Temple bar, the fireworks and the concert.  The hotel has a lovely bar and the food looked great (didn‚Äôt have any).  The private lounge and terrace for Address was a good little perk and have a great view of the fireworks at midnight!",5,2019,01,07
219,"Spacious, comfortable room; attentive service; well-situated","Nice large room with all the mod cons, large bathroom with a glorious bathtub, if I ordered room service or breakfast to the room for the morning, everything would arrive on time.  I had a nice meal in the restaurant and enjoyed being able to stop in at the bar at the end of the night.  The location is great if you plan to be doing a wide range of things in the city, which I was.  Truly no complaints.",5,2019,01,06
219,Perfect,"We were delighted with our stay and couldnt fault any aspect of the hotel and staff. Our room was amazing, spacious and modern. Great location and very pleasant staff. Will be returning in the future! ",5,2019,01,06
219,Annual Christmas break .,A very relaxing and enjoyable stay in pleasant surroundings. Close to train and bus services. All local amenities nearby. Short walk to O'Connell street with lots of shops and food outlets. Hotel has an excellent restraunt and bar with good choice of well prepared food. ,5,2019,01,06
219,Great as always,"Welcoming friendly reception, clean and comfortable. Now worthy of it‚Äôs 4 stars without a shadow of a doubt. Great place to stay. Adjacent to Connolly Station and a 10 minute walk takes you to the O‚ÄôConnell Street area.",5,2019,01,06

Staff helpful ",5,2019,01,04
219,Excellent Location,Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights over New Years. We cannot fault anything. Bus from the Airport stops around the corner which costs ‚Ç¨7 pp which runs regularly. Grafton Street is a 10 minute walk. Pubs/corner shops are within walking distance. ,5,2019,01,04
219,Lovely hotel,"Hotel was very clean, made to feel welcome by the friendly staff. The restaurant downstairs served wonderful food which was very nice and we ate there two nights in a row would highly recommend. The waiter name David was very friendly and made us feel at home.The room was up to a high standard and very comfortable to sleep in. Would stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,01,03
219,Great stay,Stayed in New Year‚Äôs Eve and thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Address.Room was clean and hotel facilities were great.Only disappointment was lack of hot water for the shower (was like warm) but didn‚Äôt ruin the stay.,5,2019,01,03
219,Modern and clean.,"It's been years from I last stayed here and I was pleasantly surprised in the refurb from then,a big improvement.

This hotel isn't in the centre but is is l9cated next to the train and bus stations and onky a short walk to the likes of O'Connell St and Temple Bar.

The room was very nice and the bed comfortable,my onky minor gripe is that I bought two pints in the bar and asked them to be added to my bill.....I'm glad I onky bought the two Guinness as the total was ‚Ç¨24 when checking out....now I know Dublin isn't cheap but that's extortion.

I'd certainly stay here again,I simply wouldn't buy a drink here again.",4,2019,01,02
219,Best Hotel I have ever stayed in!,"This hotel is amazing, totally luxurious and worth every penny. The room is exactly as pictured and the technology is just fab. We said we did not want to be disturbed on one day as we were only staying for two nights and we received a letter through the door to say if we needed anything or fresh towels then just to ask at any time! Cant fault the service at all, we managed to check in at 10am as our room was already ready! We will defo be back! Thanks again!",5,2019,01,02
219,Really nice hotel,"Really modern, clean hotel. Good location just outside the temple bar area, within 15 minutes walk from the main strip. Room was really nice with a good rooftop area. Would definitely recommend if you don‚Äôt mind a short walk to the center.",5,2019,01,02
219,Amazing time had here,Wow this hotel is lovely the room very clean and the bed so comfy.

219,Will definitely be back,Such an amazing experience at the Address from the moment we first checked in to the moment we checked out.

219,A great stay ,"Myself and my mam stayed here and we were so impressed! For the price we paid we expected the hotel to be only adequate. We were so pleasantly surprised.

219,Excellent hotel,Myself and my mother stayed here on the 22nd of December for les mis. We have stayed here before and two of the reasons are the location and the food. I want to pay compliment to Alexandra who worked the restaurant she was very friendly and so accommodating. My mother is celiac and she made sure she got all the correct information before my mother ordered without making a fuss over it. A massive compliment and thanks has to go to the front office supervisor Daniel who recovered my mother's purse which she lost the night before in a cab he was so helpful and always a smile on his face. Will be booking again for March can't wait,5,2018,12,28
219,My home away from home,"The Address is perfectly suited for my business needs when I visit Dublin. Great location next to Connolly Station & walkable to shops on Henry St. Clean, modern rooms.

219,Relaxing stay,"Stayed here with my young family while going to an event at the 3arena (The Point). Luas tram walking distance, overnight parking less than 100metres away. Staff very friendly, we had dinner in the bar on return, very tasty and good service. Room was modern and clean and tidy. Breakfast was tasty and had a good range for everyone, my kids enjoyed it and was a great start to the day. Would definitely stay here again, near lots of landmarks, and the Luas makes everywhere accessible. A boutique  experience üëç",5,2018,12,23

219,Lads Weekend in Dublin!,"Myself and 2 mates stayed here for 2 nights over 14-16 Dec. The hotel was much better than we expected; furnished to a high standard, immaculately clean, and with a couple of really good dining options. 

The beds were really comfortable and the rooms well laid out; even with 3 of us in the room it didn‚Äôt feel congested at all. 

Little touches like complimentary apples and cake nibbles in the foyer, luxury shower gel and shampoo in the showers, and really friendly staff didn‚Äôt go unnoticed. 

The hotel was located within walking distance to all of the sites we wanted to see (Temple Bar only 15 mins walk!).

Would definitely stay again if visiting Dublin (which I probably won‚Äôt do for quite some time as it‚Äôs just so expensive now!). 

PS. Thanks for bringing an ice bucket with glasses to our room allowing us to have pre-drinks before heading out! 

",4,2018,12,18
219,Amenities nice/Wake Up Call questionable,"Generally, the hotel is nice but there were a couple items that I found challenging. The floors of the Lobby, 1st floor rooms, and the basement restaurant were not identified on the elevator panel so there were a few times when I ended up on the wrong floor. With only 1 elevator, if u were on the wrong floor, you had a bit of a wait for the small elevator to return. So, pay attention when you board the elevator. The second challenge was having confidence in their Front Desk Wake Up Call service. In an 18 hr period, I requested 2 critical wake up calls: for an evening engagement & check out the next morning. They missed both of them. Since I didn't receive the 1st wake up call, I was awakened by my group leader asking me where was I because my bus was about to leave me. That was extremely stressful. When I made the 2nd request just a few hours later, I told them of my disappointment of the 1st wake up call I didnt receive  & it was extremely critical they didn't miss the 2nd one. I was assured it wouldn't happen again. When I was checking out, I told them the phone didn't ring me again. They said evidently there was a problem with their phones & apologized. That doesn't take away the problem I would've had if I didn't set my cell phone alarm as a back up. A positive experience I do remember is how soft and comfortable my pillows and bed were.",4,2018,12,18
219,Would recommend,"Great hotel, walkable distance to restaurants and temple bar. Clean room and comfy bed. Train station opposite can be noisy at times but worth the stay. Breakfast in the cellar is delicious, full Irish breakfast plus fruit and pastries! Would recommend. ",5,2018,12,18
219,Great smart rooms,"We stayed here for 2 nights for our wedding anniversary just before Xmas and it was excellent! We were in a club suite which was huge and had plenty of room! The in room smart technology was a fave of my hubby‚Äôs and I loved the luxury baths! The restaurants and bars were super nice too, and we got loads of complimentary things in with our stay too- such as the free breakfast and evening wine and nibbles up in the private club lounge! Would definitely recommend for someone wanting to stay fairly central. ",5,2018,12,17
219,Really nice hotel,"Great hotel! The staff are very helpful and we had a good laugh with the bar staff. We stayed in a triple room and it was just spot on, very clean and comfortable beds with loads of pillows. Will certainly stay here again!!!",5,2018,12,17
219,Comfortable but inconvenient,"If traveling by car, there is nowhere to park within several blocks.  Not even a loading zone for luggage, so you need to carry your bags from the other side of the train station across the street which amounts to several hundred yards.  The nearest public transportation is also several blocks away so taxi rides are the only easy option. ",4,2018,12,17
219,City Break,"My first time staying at this hotel, location is perfect in the heart of the city, only 10 minute walk from O'Connell Street. Hotel is clean and modern and has a lovely festive atmosphere. It has a lovely bar with very good food at very reasonable rates. Would recommend to friends.",5,2018,12,17
219,Perfect City Centre Location,Stayed for one night ..attendi at a concert at the 3Arena ..so very handy for the city and the concert venue Room is designed to a high standard and the hotel was warm during the wintery days.Usual buffet hot breakfast which was very good and had everything available,5,2018,12,17
219,Family trip,"Lovely hotel in a good location, close walking distance to the main Street. Hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas and early check in was accommodated. Reasonable price with clean, comfortable rooms. ",5,2018,12,16
219,Fantastic room and staff,So happy with our stay in this hotel last weekend. Such an amazing reception staff. Room was so huge and beautifully decorated. Had champagne and chocolates on arrival. They treated my sister and mother like royalty. Couldn't do any more for us. Gave us early check in too. Couldn't recommend this hotel more.Will be staying here for any other nites we have in Dublin in the future. So close to everything. Train outside the door and luas around the corner. Super,5,2018,12,15
219,Visit the Northstar,"Cannot recommend this hotel enough. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was the best one I have ever eaten at a hotel, so much choice and very fresh. The concierge was so helpful and friendly. It is ideally situated too only 10 mins walk to the main shopping area ",5,2018,12,14
219,Gig at 3 Arena,"We went to see a gig at the 3 Arena in December. We got a deal though Supervalu breaks for the NORTH star Hotel and were very impressed. The lobby, our room, McGettigans restaurant were all beautiful. The hotel had no car park but the Connolly Station Car Park is 100 m away and costs ‚Ç¨9 per day. In Dublin city centre, brilliant value! The walk to 3 Arena was very easy, Straight on for about 20 min. The breakfast was really lovely too. Just had to go onto a treadmill in the hotel gym after all that food.In summary, great experience, highly recommend it.",5,2018,12,13
219,"My staying at North Star Hotel (30 November - 8 December, 2018)","Everything was perfect! My only concern was the booking of a taxi 1,5 hours in advance and the taxi did not show up and I missed an important meeting, actually I delayed for about 55 minutes. If the taxi company is not reliable, please do change it or do not commit to the customer. Besides, the taxis are on the other side of the hotel. I could go there 30 minutes earlier and find one.",5,2018,12,13
219,Great Hotel,The hotel is actually 2 hotels in one. I had a spacious interior room that fit 2 very comfortably. It is a bit further away from the downtown area but everything was within a half hour walk. Having been to Dublin before it was nice to walk around to see streets I had not seen before. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2018,12,12
219,Dublins Heart,lovely hotel in heart of dublin and across from connelly station.The food was delicious both dinner and breakfast .rooms were good with coffee machine .we felt very relaxed and we will return again soon thanks North star,5,2018,12,12
219,North Star hotel,This hotel was a lovely modern hotel. I stayed for one night. The food was lovely in the restaurant. One thing I did not like was the cleaners woke us up at 8.30 to clean the room in the morning. The rooms were very clean and staff very friendly.,4,2018,12,12
219,100% would recommend,"Myself, my two sisters and my mother recently stayed in the North Star for my mother's and sister's birthdays. Staff were informed of this. In our room there were 4 small bottle of prosecco and chocolates for us all to enjoy. Shortly after our arrival, one of the staff members brought up a birthday cake. The exceptional service and friendliness of the staff were second to none. They really went above and beyond for us and made our stay extremely enjoyable. Would definitely recommend for location and value for money also.",5,2018,12,11
219,Bad start but it got better,"Stayed three nights at the North Star.  When we got to the room I immediately noticed the very badly stained cushions on the bed with buttons also missing, and a chewing gum wrapper sticking out of the bottom of the bed. The room was really noisy, we were on the first floor at the front of the hotel and the room was really cold.  Kept awake with the noise and and the cold, so my husband went to reception and asked if someone could take a look at the heating.  A lovely young man (Josh) realised that the heating would not come on so arranged for us to change rooms and I asked if we could possible have a quiet room.  This was when our experience of the hotel completely changed, we were moved to the fifth floor, the room was really cosy and warm and the silence was fabulous.  In our hurry to vacate the first room my husband had left some money in the safe which was returned by housekeeping, thank you for that.  Would we stay again? Definately not on the first floor but we would certainly pay the extra for one of the upgraded rooms which were lovely.  Thanks to Josh for his great customer service and Keiron the concierge was a great character also.",3,2018,12,10
219,Birthday weekend ,"Just back from a two night stay, for my partners birthday weekend. 

The hotel exceeded our expectations! Very easy to find, straight off the aircoach at O‚ÄôConnell street, 2 minute walk. 
Warm welcoming and very friendly staff :)
we stayed in King Club room, well worth the upgrade. Was beautiful. The complimentary chocolates- winner! 
access to level 7 club room... that was beautiful- the views! Amazing!  And the complimentary milky hot chocolate , Waw! 

Seen loads of complaining about the trains, we where in a room right beside the lines and it didn‚Äôt bother us one single bit, the warm coZy beautiful room and the views....more to be happy about that a wee bit train passing!

Opening the whole room from the bedside controls was fab! And the tv- loads of helpful information and good channels!

Only thing, on the last day we had no hot water.... a member of staff did attend, but it was still freezing ‚ùÑÔ∏è but the wee cold
Shower- woke us right up lol! 

We will definitely return here. Thank you for a great weekend.

219,Excellent Hotel - Highly recommend,We had such a lovely experience in this hotel.  Interior is excellent and very well looked after.   We had our lunch and the Food was fab!!  Staff were second to none and so friendly towards our two kids. Was such a lovely experience and we will definitely be back again. 5 stars all the way. ,5,2018,12,10
219,North Star Hotel is a winner,"Great front desk and morning breakfast staff headed by Priscilla, they had a room ready for early check-in.  The Cellar team quickly handled food needs, and Oralaith was a very attentive server in The Cookhouse.",5,2018,12,10
219,Poor sleep - noisy and automatic lights go off during the night! ,"I stayed 5 nights and never got a good night‚Äôs sleep. The hotel is directly flanked by train tracks and the whole place shakes when a train goes by. In addition the doors are very loud when they slam shut so you will be awoken by fellow travelers returning late or leaving earlier. Then there are the lights that automatically switch on in the middle of the night and startle you out of sleep. This happened several times! 

There are some redeeming features - rooms are comfortable and clean, breakfast buffet is well stocked with a good variety of foods, the sauna is lovely. 

Hotel is quite close to the convention center but not very convenient for downtown. Prices are high for what hotel has to offer. ",2,2018,12,09
219,Amazing service,"We stayed in this hotel last night. The welcome and service we got was exceptional. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. I emailed a few special requests before we arrived. To say they delivered is an understatement. They treated us all to complimentary champagne, chocolates and cake. They even had cards for my sister and mother. They went so out of their way it was unreal. It made our day. 
The room was so spacious and beautifully decorated. We all slept great and had amazing showers the next morning. 
I couldn't recomment this hotel more. It's close to everything. Hop on the luas and you are where ever your need to be. Parking is available close by and the train station is just across the road. 
Will be back again very soon.
Thanks again to ye all in the North Star Hotel ",5,2018,12,09
219,Stunning 100% Recommend,"Myself,Husband & Niece are on route home after having another wonderful stay @ The North Star Hotel. This is our 2nd visit in a month after experiencing a magical 40th birthday organized by my huband & Ela (Front Office Manager) We couldnt wait to get booked to return.So as a treat we brought our niece for her 14th birthday,I had such an amazing time for my birthday i knew it was the perfect present for her.
Ela arranged a few treats for her birthday and she was on cloud 9 she absolutley loved them.
It was fantastic, we stayed in a family room it had 2 Massive comfy double beds great quality bedding, Beautiful stylish decor, fridge,safe,hairdryer,fluffy towels.We had Full Irish breakfasts -all fresh produce,piping hot and an amazing choice.
I cant recommend Ela and her team enough she goes above and beyond to help make a visit to the North Star one to cherish and we cant wait to return in 2019.

219,Over priced for a below average stay with multiple issuea,"3 Night stay.... first thing is feeling the vibrations at check in counter of the train track. 
I went to open the curtains in the room to see the train track and trains go rumbling by every 5-10 minutes.... So hope you are not a light sleeper.
Water pressure was horrible day 1. Day 2 I came back from a long day and could not get hot water. Was shuffled into another room that had a pool of brown water sitting in the tub... then shuffled to another room. Which still didn't have hot water. 
Day 3 Still lack of decent hot water / pressure. 
Breakfast is below average quality. And not worth the price for add on.
Rooms are nice looking, but the whole stay was definitely not worth the higher end price.",1,2018,12,08
219,Great Hotel,"really nice hotel, in a central location. Lovely food in the bar and staff were very friendly and helpful.  Room was spacious and the bed comfortable. Only issue was no car parking at the hotel itself but good parking 10 mins walk away. would stay again!",4,2018,12,07
219,Concert overnight at 3 arena,Concert stay - bus laid on. Amazing service. Could not fault it. Bed was AMAZING and I slept like a log. Breakfast was best I‚Äôve had in a long time. Highly recommend u book through NIR travel if you‚Äôre travelling by train. ,5,2018,12,07
219,The Address at Dublin 1 - A great time and better location,"I really enjoyed staying at the Address.  The rooms were very clean and the best part is that they were modern (which I, as a tech geek, absolutely love).  Click a button and lights go on or curtains open or close.  Conveniently located near everything (well, within walking distance), but Dublin is a walking city so anywhere you stay is sure to offer the convenience of being near something.  Room service was good though the menu seemed to be a little limited.I did not eat at the restaurant - with all the pubs and eateries in Dublin, why would you?  So I cannot say how good or bad the food is at the on premise restaurants.  The one area that could use improvement is laundry.  The hotel charges a bundle for laundry service, but there is a service right on Talbot street that runs around 11 euros for a fairly decent size load.  The shopping on Talbot and Henry street is super convenient.  I would definitely stay here again, though I might want to find a place that has an indoor pool and jacuzzi. ",5,2018,12,06
219,Very close city location,"Walk across the street and you are at the light rail!  Convenient to get anywhere.  Rooms are nice although ours constantly had the heat adjusted too high.

Also fun to walk down to ""the tallest sculpture in the world"" - basically a large silver pole in the center of the commons.  Tons of stores and you can get your Vodafone SIM card for about $20 for unlimited/5GB which is a bargain.  

2 restaurants in building and gym facilities in basement, a bit of a pain to get to as your room key would not unlock the door.  Have to go to the front desk.  Gym equipment is pretty basic, needs an upgrade but will work fine for 1-2 nights to stay in shape.",5,2018,12,06
219,two stays a week apart with different results - see below,"My wife and I stayed at the North Star the first and last nights of a week-long Globus tour. The staff support was remarkable, and I want to especially praise Alexandra, the hostess in the hotel's restaurant, and her team. They were so very eager to please. They were always alert to opportunities to better serve their customers, often anticipating needs before being asked. They worked together as a true team. We stayed two additional nights following the end of the tour. The first night's room with the tour was located on the third floor. It was comfortable and quiet and offered the most comfortable bed and pillows of any hotel on the tour; however, sleep during our final three nights in room #658 was frequently interrupted due to two sources of noise. First, the floor in the hallway loudly 'squeeked' with every step by every guest throughout the night, and our room's door did nothing to buffer that noise. Second every time a sliding door to the balcony above or below our room opened, the noise was very audible. Voices and some other sounds carried through the walls and/or doors.  The design of both of our rooms was fine and very comfortable, so this problem with the second room is regrettable. Staff did a fine job to clean the rooms. On several occasions during our second stay, the elevators refused to stop on the reception (ground) level and simply kept us and other passengers inside while it went up and down until we could stop it on the second floor and walk down the stairs to the lobby. Fortunately, on the morning of our departure pulling our luggage, this problem did not occur.  Apart from the noise, this would also have been a fine stay. The hotel's location is a 10 minute walk to the Emigration Museum and about 20 minutes to other fine museums just past Trinity College.  Shopping begins just around the corner. This is very convenient location.",4,2018,12,05
219,Dublin Delight,"Spent one night in North Star Hotel with my daughter, location is excellent, next to Connolly station andon luas stops - hotel is bright, modern, welcoming and staff and SUPERB! I got upgraded to a premier room without asking and as we arrived late decided to eat in the adjoiningrestaurant which didn't disappoint. Food was excellent and very good value. Will most certainly be booking here for my next trip to Dublin.",5,2018,12,05
219,Relax in the City,"The reception is warm and welcoming, as are the staff! The rooms are comfortable and cosy. Both the food and service in McGettigan's Cookhouse and Bar are fantastic. This is definitely our go to hotel for a stay in the city!! ",5,2018,12,05
219,Great night,Was lovely really enjoyed r night in Dublin only this I can say bad about it was our room was next to the train tracks an u could hear them go up an down but everything else was great food was lovely in the restaurant an staff where super helpful ,4,2018,12,05
219,Great Stay!,"We loved this hotel! It was so spacious for a European hotel and the staff was so nice and helpful. Would definitely recommend! Location was perfect!! It is only an 8 minute walk from one of the main streets! It also seemed like a very safe area. We had no problem/worries walking around at night. The people in the hallways were loud in our room, but we turned on the A/C fan and it drowned it right out!",5,2018,12,04
219,Great hotel,"I stayed here recently when I was in Dublin on a work trip.  The hotel was clean, the staff were friendly and the food was lovely.  It is also just across the road from the train station which is very handy.  I would stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5,2018,12,04
219,"Excellent Service, Location and Ambience","The North Star Hotel has excellent service, ambience and location!  The rooms are delightful, the staff is very nice and helpful and the rooms are large and well decorated.  Breakfast is your typical English breakfast and very good. I highly recommend this hotel if staying in Dublin.  The location is fantastic for sight seeing and walking about. ",5,2018,12,04
219,Premium hi tech hotel with impeccable cleanliness,"We have visited on the beginning of December for two nights, mainly we came to see a concert at Button Factory but also hang around in the city. This was my third visit to Dublin, having stayed before at Radisson Blu and some very nice Airbnb at Rathmines this one has not disappointed either. Location wise, it was ideal for the AirLink bus from the airport, it stopped almost outside of the hotel; return is a bit further walk to the stop by the coach station. It is a bit of a walk to the main historic/touristy part of town but not prohibitively far. The hotel itself is a beautiful and newly renovated building, as I understand it has two parts, one is newly built The Address and the other is The North Star, it can be slightly confusing at first which facilities belong to which hotel. Staff were very nice and polite, we got shown to our room. And also we arrived early and to our surprise our room was ready at like 11 am and we could check in early, which was totally fantastic as we departed early in the morning and had a great nap before venturing off to the city. Very nice welcome setup with chocolates and water! Coffee machine in the room was fantastic, so were complimentary slippers and bathrobes. The room itself was absolutely spotless (I tend to notice the details like that as a former 4* hotel housekeeper for 3 years lol). The view from the window was fantastic, however, bear in mind that some rooms overlook the railway line so you get trains passing, and while the room is soundproofed the passing trains are still audible. We didn't mind at all but I understand this may not be to everyone's liking. Great technology in the room, we welcomed the usb charging points for charging the phones. The bathroom was really pleasant and well designed (often find in the hotels that especially by the sink everything is getting wet when you use it, this was not the case here!). It may be a little too dark if you wanted to apply makeup. Following hi-tech vibe, it would have been nice if the mirrors were heated so they don't steam up after the shower. My only pet peeve for the bathroom was that the toilet flush buttons are located so that when you open the lid they are behind it, call me picky but I found it annoying having to close it every time to flush (but certainly not a dealbreaker here). I loved the tv and the option to order from the pillow menu, I ordered soft pillows via tv and got delivered super quick to the room, and they were amazing! Air conditioning was slightly confusing to figure out however on the plus side it was very quiet and it didn't blow cold air directly into the room (that also often annoys me as a design flaw). We didn't have breakfast so I can't comment on that but we did have a dinner at the restaurant downstairs and it was really nice, relatively small menu with some daily specials. All cooks and staff seemed really nice and the prices are very reasonable with great quality and portion sizes. 
Overall very happy with the experience and I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,12,02
219,Highly recommend!,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my 3 friends, the trip away was cheap and boozy but we were greatly surprised at how lovely the hotel was. The staff are really helpful, the rooms are modern comfy and clean with a great shower. There is a cafe and restaurant in the hotel which were both lovely too.

There is a bike rental stand round the corner which was good fun, and the hotel is close to cheap but bog standard takeaway and fast food places.

If you are looking for nights out I would recommend Dicey‚Äôs and definitely Copper Face Jacks - cheap drinks and good music! 

The only negative about the hotel is that they said one of the rooms would be ready at 2pm however was not ready until 4pm.",4,2018,12,02
219,Handy location for the 3arena & shopping,"Had a lovely night's sleep here - after a long night out after a gig. 
The beds are very comfy and the rooms/bathrooms very clean, although I found the automatic lights whenever someone got up very annoying as someone who likes darkness for sleep. I feel like this isn't just me either! And they stayed on for what seemed like a really long time. A little unnecessary? 
The young lady at reception was really unfriendly when I checked in, perhaps she felt like I didn't look up to scratch to be checking into the hotel, with my backpack & waterproof jacket after walking all the way from Jervis St. in the heavy rain. A smile and a more helpful manner wouldn't go astray, she left a lasting impression to be honest.
Overall the location is great for the 3arena and amenities, and well looked after. I would have to agree with some other reviews though about the housekeeping. Check out until 11:30, and after a late night (which you would probably expect at this hotel because of gig-goers) the last thing you want is housekeeping knocking before you've even got up. We didn't add on breakfast at the hotel - so it could be assumed we wouldn't be up early - it might be an idea to leave those rooms until checkout.",3,2018,12,02
219,Quality hotel,"Fantastic hotel, great location for concerts, shopping or site seeing. All staff were very friendly & accomodating. Room spacious, comfortable bed. Food delicious in McGettigans, especially the chicken wings & beef cheeks. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay & we'll return soon! ",5,2018,12,02
219,Top Notch Hotel with great location,"We enjoyed two nights at the North Star and one night at The Address. Excellent location andaccommodations. Great staff, all very helpful.  Nice full breakfast with wonderful choices. The Addresswas really luxurious. The bed so comfortable. We hope to stay there again. Easy walking to all of Dublin and just across from the train station.",5,2018,12,01
219,Trip to 3 Arena,"Wonderful hotel, premier rooms are extremely well appointed and worth the extra cost. Staff very professional and helpful - I would definitely recommend this hotel above some city centre 5 star venues. ",5,2018,12,01
219,Lovely hotel,"My friends and I recently had a one night stay here and were pleasantly surprised. The reception area is very nice however the lady on reception was not the friendliest. There was nine of us split over three rooms and payment was demanded upon arrival. 
The rooms were a good size and had all amenities needed such as hairdryer, kettle and toiletries. The waterfall shower was great!
The one thing we found very annoying was the sensor lights under the bedside tables. These came on every time anyone moved in the room including turning over in bed! 
Around a 15 minute walk away from Temple Bar but plenty of pubs in the vicinity. Also papa John's is just round the corner! ",4,2018,12,01
219,Excellent stay!,We were visiting Ireland from the US and our stay at The North Star/The Address was nothing short of wonderful. The staff was courteous and helpful and handled a minor issue with our room with an upgrade which wasn‚Äôt necessary but much appreciated. Great customer service!,5,2018,11,30
219,grand,"everyone was so verry hepful., they helped me decided on what shoud do and see in the time i had. the breakfasts  were grand loved the pancakes. was not able to make the toast too well it burnt on one side and was nice on the other.",4,2018,11,30
219,Housekeeping ,"For my first time at this hotel, i unfortunately didn't get to spend much time here. However on arrival the foyer was beautifully lit, and the receptionist was very efficient. I had been assigned a family room,for 1 person. I had messaged the hotel prior to my arrival to let them know my friend was not coming. No effort was made to allocate me a different room. She said ""all our room Allocations are done now"".The hotel was not booked out that night, and being a receptionist myself it is not hard to change room. Anyway the room was clean with all amenities, the bed was very comfortable. The next morning I was rudely awoken by housekeeping at 9am,then at 10am and then again.. I really could of done with a lie in as I had been out the night before. I then placed the do not disturb sign on the door... And they still knocked. In our hotel we do not disturb the guest until they have checked out and communicate with the reception team. Very disappointed with this. I had no food or drinks in the hotel so can't review those. I would like to return to the hotel again, but the fear of not getting to enjoy my sleep in morning has made me hesitant. ",3,2018,11,30
219,"Modern, comfortable, but get a quiet room","A really nice stay for three nights (though I am still a bit unclear about what's The North Star and what's The Address?). The room was well equipped and comfortable - arriving very late we were 'upgraded' at the desk and though that meant that we got a nice big room it also meant that we were in one practically on top of the railway lines (it occurred to us that we were put there as a late arrival and these rooms might be the last to be filled...but who knows?) It's not so disturbing once you get used to it, but it came as a surprise and the hotel should maybe look at some extra glazing/soundproofing for these rooms? 

Though the immediate area is a tad scruffy, you're only 10-15 minutes walk from lots of the bits of Dublin you'll want to see - Temple Bar, Trinity, the GPO etc - and we got a very good price on the room versus some Southside options so were pretty happy with that. The restaurant is good - the diner feel led us to expect standard fare, but it was much better than that, and the staff there were friendly and warm.",4,2018,11,27
219,Modern 3-4* Hotel,"Nutshell: + Decent hotel atmo & room interior, good bed, nice lounge w/ complimentary wine //  - tiny bathroom with bathtub shower, mediocre location if you want to experience Dublin by foot, in-room noise level from hallway

So, first of all lets make it clear: The Addresse is the ""premium wing"" (quote by a staff member) of the North Star Hotel - and you def. better want to be at The Address than at the North Star.
Location: Convenient if you travel by train (Connelly station) or coming from the airport by the AirLink bus as teh stop is just 2mins walking away. However, please keep in mind that you are ~20min walk away from all of Dublin's major attractions if you are in for sightseeing and/or restaurants/bars/nighlife. The route along the river is nice though.
Hotel entrance: The Address & North Star have one joint entrance and check-in area, only difference is that TA has a dedicated desk. Other than that very warm & cozy atmo.
Layout: As said before, TA is part of the North Star hotel, but as a TA guest you have access to the designtaed TA areas, elevators etc by your room key. All TA areas look nice and recently renovated, North Star areas not so much.
Staff: The check-in process was quick & staff was extremely friendly. 
Room: Comfy and huge Kingsize bed, comfy pillows. Thats good. Tiny bathroom with a bathtub shower, def. not good for elder people as you need to 'climb'. Temperature was an issue during our stay (cold!) as the window/outer wall is poorly lagged. But heating/AC worked well to warm-up the room. Noise level from the hallway through the door is an issue, too, as you can hear the noice, steps, voices etc from the hallway almost as there was no door. Room overall is very ""techy"", e.g. all info can be found by switching on the TV, all controls are touich operated etc. Cool - but not sure if seniors would like that, too. Room was clean, but the carpets in the room don't look clean at all. Strange look is also the room entrance has tiles - which are different from those in the hallway.
Extras: As a TA guest you have access to a rooftop lounge where you'll get free wine & nibbles between 630-730pm. Also good view. Nice! Side note: On the way to the lounge from the elevator you see the North Star areas - and you are once again happy to stay at TA.
Room reco: Make sure you ask for a room away from the train tracks.",3,2018,11,27
219,Great Hotel,"We really enjoyed the stay. Upgrading the room was completely worth it. However, a few of the front desk staff members came off as really rude. Also, the first room we were put in had some issues with damage to one particular wall. We mentioned it to the staff and they moved us to a new room. The new room had the most amazing view...room 631 for all those who are interested. ",4,2018,11,26
219,Ultra Modern Hotel An Absolute Delight!,"From the moment I walked through the front door I was so pleased with my choice of hotel.  It was warm, festive and very inviting. The check-in process was quick and the staff were extremely friendly.  The room was fantastic and completed exceeded my expectations.  The extra little touches such as the complimentary chocolates, the wide choice of herbal teas and the coffee machine just added to the whole experience. The room had a smart TV and excellent wifi. I didn't want to leave! The location is also good, especially if you have travelled by train. I feel like quite a few Dublin hotels have an undeserved 4 star rating as they are badly in need of upgrading. The North Star/Address at Dublin 1 however, puts them all to shame. Cannot wait to stay there again.  ",5,2018,11,26
219,Excellent,Address at North Star is a lovely place to stay. Very clean and comfortable. Great public transport on your doorstep but walking distance to city centre. Great breakfast. Lovely friendly staff.  Would stay again.,5,2018,11,26
219,Great location,Great location with easy walking access to most attractions in the city the furthest is the Guinness Storehouse which is a 30 minute walk.The team at the North Star are very helpful and friendly. Book the breakfast in arrival for each day as it will set you up for the day ahead.,5,2018,11,26
219,Beautiful hotel. Very friendly staff,Would highly recommend this hotel. Food was delicious and the hotel staff so friendly and helpful. Rooms very clean. Just a brilliant atmosphere...  Christmas decorations were great. Will definitely be back.....,5,2018,11,26
219,Fantastic Hotel,Just had a 2 night family break at the North Star Hotel. Fantastic hotel - great location for city shopping and access to the Aviva stadium.  Staff were extremely professional - would highly recommend and will definitely be back. ,5,2018,11,25
219,"Super helpful staff, beautiful surroundings, great perks.","Got upgraded because of my accessibility needs. Such a blessing after a long journey. Staff were helpful - always. Lovely perks. Good decor. Comfy bed and great pillows. Nice toiletries. Also, visit McGavigans-seriously amazing steak sandwich(& nice staff there, too!!!)

Only comment I'd make is that the lobby music was lovely when it was ambient, but a bit much when electro(& I say that as someone who loves dance/house/alternative) and that the music in the Parlor didn't match the ambience or beautiful decor. Invest in something that matches your brand!! :-)",5,2018,11,25
219,Room cleaning at 8am Sunday morning. ,"We were woken by group of people spanning 5 hotel rooms at 6.30 am changing rooms as they were all part of one group who checked in together so management  were aware that they were travelling as a group. At 8 the noise finally stopped to be replaced by cleaning of all those rooms. 
Finally contacted reception at 10 am who on relating that we could not sleep since 6.30 and that cleaning had begun at 8, asked was it only for a few hours, that we should have called sooner and they would have moved us and offered us late checkout or complementary coffee but did not ask the cleaning staff to wait till after 11 to continue cleaning. Or that on check in we should have asked for a quiet room. 10 mins after the phonecall cleaning staff knocked on our door to clean our room as nothing had been relayed by reception. When mentioned on checkout as we just gave up due to the level of noise and left, the receptionist did not know what we were talking about. I again explained and they alluded that it was the cleaning staffs fault who had not been aware there was an occupied room and had been very friendly to us. She also said that city centre hotels were noisy, which I accepted but questioned the need to clean the rooms for 2 hours on a Sunday morning from 8 o clock. On original check in we had been sighed at and given incorrect information on where our room was located. All in all a very unsatisfactory experience which could have been easily remedied had staff listened to us at any point. I have stayed at numerous similarly priced hotels in Dublin with far better customer service. We had chosen to try this hotel as it was near the abbey theatre and would have been lovely for future visits. However I would not stay there again. ",1,2018,11,25
219,Weekend break,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  It felt like a home away from home.  The catering staff were especially warm and welcoming. The room was clean and comfortable, power shower was refreshing and the location was so convenient.",5,2018,11,25
219,First class,"Not sure where to start...... we arrived very early due to morning flight, so we wanted to drop the bags off at the hotel, when we arrived at 9.30 our rooms was ready, couldn‚Äôt fault it. The room had plenty of space and was very well maintained. We didn‚Äôt have breakfast at the hotel on either of the 2 days we were there, so can‚Äôt comment. 

The bar was great as was the service, got really busy in the evenings with a nice atmosphere.

What a guy the concierge is, a right character, take time to speak to him as he is a pleasure in listening to.

Hotel has a great location and is in easy walking distance even to the Guinness factory, only half hour but you get to see so much.

I think you get it by now that I would highly recommend this place, you won‚Äôt be disappointed 

Thanks again

219,Weekend break,"My husband and myself just spent the weekend here on our 1st visit to Dublin for my husband's birthday. Lovely hotel with very friendly staff. Our room was lovely although the cushions on the bed need attention, dirty. The bathroom was lovely and clean, bath panel needs fixing and the shower is great as long as you are not 6ft tall, cannot be raised. Had to ask for water for the room, this is not supplied as standard. All in all a very pleasant stay though and would use this centrally located hotel again. ",4,2018,11,19
219,Very nice indeed ,"Friendly, clean, cosy and really couldn‚Äôt find much to complain about if I tried. Modern rooms, lovely shower. TV channel section slightly limited but that is what Netflix Downloads are for when you are too tired from a busy day in Dublin to do anything but veg and get room service! ",4,2018,11,19
219,Last minute turn of fate,"Having booked an Air B&B which cancelled on us 3 hours before we were due to go to the airport, the North Star Hotel was a last minute panic booking to find somewhere to stay for our weekend away to Dublin. Well they say things happen for a reason, the North Star was absolutely beautiful! Gorgeous rooms, lovely staff and facilities we are so glad we got to stay here and couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. Thank you :)",5,2018,11,18
219,Ideal location,"Great hotel, close to everything walking distance to city centre and directly across from Connelly station. Club lounge on the 7th floor is brilliant, it has a light breakfast available free of charge and refreshments available all day.",5,2018,11,18
219,Nice modern hotel ,"Very nice modern hotel, very very clean with plenty of mod cons in the rooms. Such as touch pads for lighting up your room, nice lcd TVs on the wall. The coffee machines serve very nice coffees in your rooms. 

They also have a nice little lounge on the 7th floor which has complimentary drinks and snacks. 

If I was to be critical WiFi that can only be used in your room is a little disappointing however it‚Äôs all very clean and sleek. 

Location was great for us straight off the Airlink from Dublin Airport with a very short 2-3 minute walk from Talbot Road bus stop. It‚Äôs only about a 10 minute walk to O‚ÄôConnell street. 

Pleasant staff too. We never ate there however the bar and restaurants always seemed busy so that must be a good sign.

219,5*,"My husband surprised me with a weekend at the Northstar hotel for my 40th Birthday.Its easy to see why the Northstar is the Winner of Irelands Best city hotel 2018.My husband arranged my birthday surprise with front office manager Ela.When my husband was booking the surprise trip he later told me Ela made the booking effortless for him.In our room was a birthday greeting,a birthday card and a box of chocolates.The room was astonishing.We ate in McGettigans onsite restaurant for my b'day meal the food was beautiful.Ela took the booking as im sure she does with thousands of guests but to me it wasnt just another weekend away,From the moment we arrived until the second we checked out we where shown 5* treatment.Thankyou so much Ela & all of the team.
The Northstar is where memories are made to be cherished forever.

Regards 
Janice & Brian Quinn",5,2018,11,18
219,Top class hotel,"My husband and I stayed recently in the Address part of the hotel. 5star experience, friendly and professional staff, breakfast was amazing, so tasty, bed was so comfy! Good location across from Connolly train station and close to luas stop. Would highly recommend! Thank you North Star! ",5,2018,11,17
219,Overnight at the address,"First time visitor.  Lovely rooms, great food, thanks Irish Dave, and very clean friendly and tidy.  Very nice to be invited for a glass of wine that evening.  Lovely breakfast too.  Will stay with you again.",4,2018,11,16
219,Fabulous state of the art hotel,"Lovely hotel with many extra complimentary touches, which made for a wonderful experience.  Our room backed directly onto the Dart railway line, but we were not particularly perturbed by that.  However, what we were not informed of was that engineering works to the track were taking place overnight, directly outside the room, which took place on the first night between 1.40 a.m. until after 3.30 a.m., and it was impossible to get any sleep.  We mentioned this to reception staff later that morning, who informed us they were unaware of any scheduled works and could not confirm if works would be taking place again the following morning, but they would check and let us know.  When we checked with them later, they still could not confirm if works would be taking place, but they could move us to another room, which we decided to accept.  The new room was on the same floor (3rd) and did not back directly onto the track, but unfortunately the engineering work did take place again the following morning for a similar period of time, and although the noise was not as bad as the previous night, it was still noticeable.  We appreciate that this type of work is out of the control of the hotel, but we would have like to have been informed so that we could have requested a different room at the start of our stay.  I would add that the staff were polite and helpful, and other than the commencement of engineering works coinciding with our stay, I would reiterate that the hotel in general and the rooms were special and well worth a stay (just check there are no early morning engineering works scheduled!)",4,2018,11,16
219,Reasonable,"I picked the hotel as it is very convenient location wise for a business meeting that I travelled to Dublin for.  The room was average - quite corporately decorated and on the dark side, particularly the bath room. Nice coffee machine. I‚Äôd stay again if visiting the same client but otherwise I‚Äôd find an alternative hotel. ",3,2018,11,15
219,Overnight stay in Dublin for an event in 3 arena,"Stayed overnight for a concert in the 3 arena. Location to arena was good. Connected by luas service close by. Travelled by car but on checkout staff informed me they had no affiliation with a local car park which was disappointing. Luckily enough the car park understood and only charged for overnight fee. Car park was a little far from hotel and especially when it rained it certainly didn‚Äôt help. If traveling by rail it is a perfect choice, if I was traveling by car again to Dublin I would probably use another hotel. Hotel was clean, well staffed, nice food and drink on offer. One small downfall, there was no bottled water in our room post checking in. ",4,2018,11,12
219,Perfect choice for a special weekend in Dublin,"Excellent location, beautifully presented rooms, courteous and helpful staff and complimentary continental breakfast and wine/cheese on the Saturday evening - a simply prefect choice for a special weekend in Dublin!!",5,2018,11,12
219,Excellent - Rugby Weekend Stay,"I hadn't heard of this hotel before but was really pleasantly surprised how good it was.  I was in Dublin for a weekend with my son and brother and wanted somewhere central to stay. My room was really spacious and comfortable, the hotel staff were very friendly and professional and the there was the opportunity to sit and have a Guiness and some food in the excellent hotel bar.",5,2018,11,12
219,1st business trip to Dublin in years,So hard to find good central reasonably priced hotels in Dublin. May have ticked all the boxes on this one. Good nights sleep and very quiet.  We only stayed one night but goi g back this week for 4 nights.,4,2018,11,12
219,Excellent,"Excellent hotel , we stayed there in November and the staff were really friendly especially the bar man who engaged in friendly conversation with me and my wife , spotlessly clean bedroom with modern technology , even my name appeared on the television when we turned it on , would definitely stay there again ",5,2018,11,09
219,North Star Hotel Dublin,"Excellent hotel, good location, staff very attentive made my stay more enjoyable. Breakfast was outstanding one of the best I have eaten in a hotel. I would 100% stay at his hotel again. First class experience.",5,2018,11,09
219,U2 CONCERT TRIP,"Very impressed with the quality of the North Star hotel.  Staff very friendly and efficient, super breakfast. Very handy location for local places of interest as well as walking into the city centre.  Can't wait to return.",5,2018,11,08
219,excellent,"Great location near the 3 arena and the shopping areas in Dublin , the lucas is just outside the hotel if you want to go further a field. The rooms are very modern and clean ,very good breakfast  with plenty of choice and all the staff were very helpful. Great hotel in the centre of Dublin.",5,2018,11,08
219,A great weekend away.,"I came here the other weekend on a hen do. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were well equipped, clean and lovely. However, we had a few issues. Upon arrival we were charged an extra ¬£10 each on top of what we had already paid. This was apparently due to the exchange rate between Ireland and England. As there was a lot of us, this did cost a great deal more. So just be weary of the exchange rate as they might say it costs more when you get there which by my standards is poor. In my room, it seemed to be above the bar. The music was so loud and went on till around half 12. When you've been traveling since 4.30 that morning, it is not the best thing when you need to get some sleep, so we had to go down and complain. 

The restaurant in the hotel was also lovely and had delicious food.
I would recommend this hotel, just make sure you've got a fair bit of extra money on you for the additional charges they make you pay.",3,2018,11,08
219,Lovely stay,"Really enjoyed a two night stay here recently. Very central location.  Ideal for 3 arena (15 mimute walk or you can get the Luas up the road to 3 arena). Ideal fir town. Lovely dinner, good choices, very nice waiters. Lovely breakfast. Will def be back. ",5,2018,11,07
219,Excellent visit,"Nice place to stay, very pleasant experience, rooms are fitted out to a high spec. The concierge escorting you to your room I thought was a bit over the top. Work have a corporate rate so makes it very good value",4,2018,11,07
219,A shining beacon in the heart of Dublin!,"Totally loved The Address Dublin 1 and The North Star. We booked a total of 3 rooms - Club Suite, Club King and the King Premier. All rooms were delightfully spacious, clean and cosy.The facilities are grand and we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts at The Cellar, dinner and drinks at McGettigan's Cookhouse. A special shoutout to David and Aidan at McG's - they made our evenings memorable indeed with their service and attention.The location of the hotel is also great. We'll definitely be back, The Address/North Star. Ta so much for a great holiday. Cheers!",5,2018,11,07
219,Great hotel,"It is clean, quiet, wonderful, and close to city center about 8 minutes walk also very close to bus station and opposite Connolly train station. It is as smart room which everything is electric. I think it is good value. I really liked it and recommend it. ",5,2018,11,06
219,Very friendly staff and a great service very good all round idea location would recommend a stay is this hotel,The level of service was excellent the staff were very friendly the food was great and the location was very central and convenient I'd recommend it to all will definitely be back had a great stay indeed good value as well,5,2018,11,05
219,Great Hotel,"Splendid hotel in the heart of Dublin. 5 minute walk to O'Connell street, across the road from Connolly train station. Staff are excellent, very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was lovely there. Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the bed is one of the best I have ever slept in!! I look forward to staying there again next time I am in Dublin ",5,2018,11,05
219,Globus tour northern ireland,This hotel was fantastic. We arrived and they had great concierge and bag drop. The bed was comfy. The food was fantastic. The hotel was close enough to amenities. We were able to walk to grafton street within 20 min.,5,2018,11,05
219,Staying in Dublin (North Star Hotel),My boyfriend and I stayed at the North Star Hotel for three days/nights in October 2018. We had a very peaceful stay with friendly and courteous staff members. The concierge was helpful in guiding us about the tours and landmarks in Dublin that we should see. We are satisfied with the overall experience at this hotel.,5,2018,11,03
219,Too many failures to give a good review,"The North Star is in a very handy location for offices that I visit.  It is right beside Dublin's Main Bus station, and second largest Train Station.

The location has some drawbacks, be self aware going in and out.  Being close to a train station comes with the downside of Train Noise.

Generally I would say the facilities are good.  The Room I had was adequate.  The bathroom door is broken, but I stayed alone so I didn't really care.  The bathroom itself is very dim, it needs better lighting.

Despite the hotel being recently renovated I felt everything was just a little scruffy, not very clean or fresh.  I was nervous about using glasses or drinking water in the room as a result.

My fears were realised when I went to the 7th floor for the continental breakfast.  There was a fruit salad that had definitely seen better days.  There was a large bluebottle fly floating in the Orange juice and the room itself was dirty.  It needed a really good cleaning.  

I skulked away with a coffee, leaving the food and the fly, behind.",3,2018,11,02
219,Great location very modern decor,Just spent 3 nights at this lovely hotel . Very modern decor.  Great location and friendly staff . Only downside was train noises but wear earplugs at night you will be fine . On 7th you have access to a lounge . Very clean hotel.  Would use hotel again for sure and recommend it .,5,2018,11,02
219,Counting Crows,We came to see the Counting Crows at the 3Arena - the location was perfect - we were able to walk everywhere and get a bus to and from the Airport.The Hotel is fantastic inside - we stayed in the new rooms at The Address which were lovely.The Parlour looked nice but 1 member of staff (not at fault - just not enough staff) and not all of the pastries available at 9am was a little disappointing - we had to ait too long for our food.The lounge on the 7th floor was a nice touch but there was a man asleep outside and no one asked him to move on so it wasn't a comfortable place to stay.Overall I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.,4,2018,11,02
219,Good but overpriced,"Very thin walls. No parking. Breakfast not worth 13.50 each. Check in and out slow. Nice room with expensive fitings, TV can turn off lights and close curtains. Sensors turn on low lights and bathroom light if motion is detected after lights have been turned off from the bed. ",3,2018,10,31
219,Convenient location,"Travelling up to Dublin from the west of Ireland, the location of this hitrl meams tgat you csn leave ghe car at home and get the train. It used to be a very shabby spot but in the past couple of years they've done it up and its now quite nice. You can usyally get a good deal here as well. It's also right on the DART and the LUAS so you can access lots of places by public transport. Just be sure and check the setting on the a/c so you don't get roasted out of it as we did. Helpful low-key staff at reception. Breakfast alright but if youre more adventurous, I'm sure uou voukd do brtter in some of the spots down Talbot Street.",4,2018,10,31
219,Great base for my first Dublin Marathon,"Stayed here for two nights and used it as my base for the Dublin Marathon. The hotel was perfect in location with a 25minute walk to the start line. A great warm up in the morning. 

The room was really comfortable and the breakfast had everything I needed. 

I ended up setting a new personal best marathon time on the day which I was delighted with!

Will be entering the marathon next year and will definitely use this hotel as my base again.",5,2018,10,30
219,Excellent Hotel,"I really like the North Star. It is where I invariably stay when I am in Dublin. Fantastic staff, fantastic rooms and convenient for most things in the city centre. So convenient for Connolly Station too and the direct bus to the airport stops very close by too. ",5,2018,10,29
219,Night away ,"We had a wee night away and stayed here , perfect for shopping , sightseeing relaxing or room was so beautifull, complete with mini fridge, coffee machine , our own privet balcony and eve a privet lounge for our floor .. 
and it didn't break the bank.. 
the staff were so welcoming and couldnt do enough to help and as we were unfortunately leaving a disappointing stay at another hotel nearby, they were so kind as to get us our room early and hold our bags safly while we waited . 
enjoyed every minute of our stay we already have our next trip booked ...

Thank you all see u soon",5,2018,10,29
219,Stay at North Star Hotel Dublin,What a fantastic place to stay.Staff were pleasant and helpful.The room was clean.Excellent room service.The location so near to Connolly station Short walking distance to City centre.Breakfast great selection and resturant food very well presented and good value.,5,2018,10,28
219,Perfect as always,Stayed here so many times and it keeps getting better. The hotel and staff are without a doubt the best in Dublin and we will certainly be back soon and we would highly recommend to everyone visiting Dublin x,5,2018,10,26
219,An adorable stay,"My booking and my stay at the North Star were absolutely perfect! I will definetely recommend it! The breakfast was tasty, the bed is a dream! The shower was absolutely ok and the service around the clock is always there, no matter what you need! I enjoyed my stay and I will do it again in the North Star Hotel!",4,2018,10,25
219,As expected.,We really enjoyed our stay. Our 6th floor room was very quiet and extremely comfortable.  I found the room to be immaculate and felt very new. The location was great. Reasonably priced parking available in train station across the road. The staff were also very friendly and efficient.  What is promised on the website is what you can expect. ,4,2018,10,21
219,Gorgeous hotel,First time staying at the north star hotel and looking forward to going back. Staff were so friendly and accommodating. The  food was fantastic and so were the cocktails. Thanks for a lovely stay Melissa and Shane room 762,5,2018,10,20
219,Nice place but AC problem,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights while in Dublin. On the first night we had an issue with the AC not working in our room. The next day we reported it and they moved us to another room. The service here was great. Although, the traditional Irish breakfast was, interesting to say the least. If you like runny eggs, beans, sausage, and hash browns then it‚Äôs what you are looking for. ",4,2018,10,20
219,excellent especially the bed,"place in the heart of the city. modern,clean, tech.  staff nice. most amazing is the bed. you are going to want to change your mattress when you get home. i am looking for a new mattress for my bed at home.  ",5,2018,10,20
219,Great hotel,"This hotel was lovely with very friendly staff. We were upgraded on arrival to a premium and we also received a complimentary drink (pint of Guinness and a glass of wine) in their bar, this was a very nice and unexpected extra. The cooked breakfast was also lovely and could not fault. I only give it 4 stars as the floor boards were quite creaky and also the shower screen would not stay in place (which resulted in a wet floor. These things however did not bother us to much.",4,2018,10,20
219,Vacation hotel that‚Äôs pretty good but...,"Well, it‚Äôs overall ok for the money, meaning the included American style breakfast and proximity to Dublin City, train station and bus station, and an easy walk to the river are all good, but yes, it‚Äôs loud at times, room cleaning isn‚Äôt always completed (trash left behind), and the language spoken by staff of Polish, Brazilian and Portuguese is not quite understandable English. 

However, the actual Irish employees at the front desk are excellent, meaning that they quickly address your needs and direct you to where you want to go. 

The attached cafe is handy, and the snack room on the 7th floor is nice as well. 

There‚Äôs a restaurant in the hotel that‚Äôs worth your meals at almost any time, and the menu is tasty and well prepared, and the service and cordiality are excellent. 

Bottom line: the hotel is often overwhelmed by tourists at peak traffic times, if that‚Äôs an acceptable excuse, so sorry, it‚Äôs just a 3 of five stars for me.",3,2018,10,20
219,totaly bad,"Food is really tasteless and not fresh,(pizza is frozen, as every sweet and bread from breakfast to dinner,  rooms dirty even bathrooms ( ladies cleaning all room with towel)‚Ä¶.worst experience ever‚Ä¶...",1,2018,10,19
219,"Not great, not horrendous","Having just stayed at the hotel on a recent work trip I wanted to review it based on my experience. I visit Dublin for work on average I am there every 6 weeks throughout the year. This was my first and probably last time staying at this hotel. Talking to colleagues this place isn't new. It is simply part of the North Star hotel and has a few extra bells and whistles. The room was great to be fair but the biggest let down is the poor noise insulation in the rooms. The train track is right beside the hotel and run so close to the hotel you can see the colour of the people's eyes on the train! So unless you don't want to sleep before 1130pm and don't mind being awake at 5am then you will be ok here. The lounge for continental breakfast and evening drinks offers a very poor selection at both times. Croissangs. Fruit salad and yoghurt in the morning and wine that is policed by a waiter in the evening.  Dinner at the onsite restaurant was poor. I opted for the pasta with mushrooms and blue cheese sauce and avocado side salad. The pasta sauce hadn't seen a crumb of blue cheese and the avo salad comprised of 3 very ripe pieces of avo and a handful of bagged lettuce leaves. Not worth the money. And finally Aidan who serves in the bar needs to be more welcoming, and not so rude. In summary the hotel is trying to be something it can't. 
",2,2018,10,18
219,Unique,This hotel is still one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at. They clean the rooms everyday and they are very trustworthy. They were so kind to us even when our flight got in at 4am instead of 6. They go above and beyond for you. Overall this place is fantastic. The feeling you get when you walk in is indescribable. STAY HERE!!,4,2018,10,18
219,"Nice hotel, but loud","Overall, it was a nice hotel with a lot of charm. Breakfast had one of the widest selections I have ever seen which was a massive plus in my eyes. However, neither me nor my partner slept a wink. We were on the first floor, but the street outside may have been in the room with us for all the soundproofing in it. Obviously there would be some noise being in city centre but at some stage during the night, I could even hear someone running past on the street below. If you are a heavy sleeper, this may not affect you at all, but unfortunately, I'm a light sleeper. The cleaner was also hoovering the hallway at 8am, which didn't bother us too much because we were up for breakfast at this stage, but if you were looking for a lie in, you likely won't get it. Overall, a nice hotel but not somewhere for light sleepers!",4,2018,10,17
219,Amazing!,"Cannot thank the hotel staff enough literally went that extra mile to make sure our stay was pleasant..

Upon early arrival our room was ready to which we were helped to our room with our luggage and the room was immaculate. A large clean cosy bright room. Restaurant food was beautiful. Prices were reasonable. Very helpful staff

Central location",5,2018,10,16
219,Great Irish hospitality,"It was a last min booking and when we arrived we were checked in quickly and our room was very close to the railway line but we didn‚Äôt mind that much how ever the shower didn‚Äôt work in our room that we minded. So the  management moved us to the only room left in the hotel which was a deluxe upgrade ( bacause they were fully booked )it was really nice . The hotel staffs  were generally very pleasant and very professional. It was clean and comfortable, they helped us print out the boarding pass for our journey home. Nothing was too much trouble.
It was a pleasant stay. Will go back again . But one tip .....ask for a room away from the railway line.",4,2018,10,16
219,Very nice and comfortable,"Very nice clean and comfortable hotel with friendly staff. Situated in the center of Dublin it is easy to access and close to most of the attractions. If only it was not raining. We had a family room, which was a bit small for a room of such type, anyway we did not spend a lot of time there.",5,2018,10,16
219,The hotel refuses to give an invoice!!!,"I booked the hotel on their own website (so no interference of a booking site!) and prepayed the amount for the whole period of our stay (three days). When checking out the hotel refused to deliver me the invoice. This is totally unacceptable and a practice I never experienced in any hotel. So be aware, if you have to get evidence of your stay for  the bookkeping of your expenditure you may have serious difficulties.",3,2018,10,15
219,Dublin weekend,A party of 9 stayed here for one night on 13th October.The hotel was excellent very clean and the rooms were very spacious with everything you needed.we would recommend this hotel to anyone. The location was ideal for all bars and restaurants.,5,2018,10,15
219,Wonderful new hotel in Dublin,The Address at Dublin 1 is a Wonderful hotel that is also in a great location.  Connolly Station is across the street and offers train and Taxi service. Most Dublin attractions are only a 10-20 Minute walk from this location. The Concierge's Kernan and Martin were both wonderful and so helpful.  Anna and Lucas at the front desk are also great and made my stay here great. McGettigans Steakhouse is located near the lobby and the food is so darn good and very affordable. David our server is also a wonderful person and so pleasant when he waits on the table. The buffet breakfast in the lower level was very good and the selection of food items was plentiful. The 7th floor business lounge was also very nice with wine and cheese hour from 6pm-7pm the morning breakfast there in the 7th floor lounge was soooooo good with fresh croissants and yogurt and coffee with a nice view of Dublin in the morning. The King size bed in the room was comfortable and the bathroom was also very nice. The overall impression of this Hotel is Outstanding and I had a chance to talk to Peter the Hotel Manager before we left to go back to Philadelphia to express to him what a wonderful experience we had while there. Thank you to everyone at The Address at Dublin 1 for making my trip to Dublin so wonderful.,5,2018,10,14
219,Beautiful-clean-friendly-comfy,Brought our daughters to Why don‚Äôt we in the Bord Gais Theatre so decided to stay over and found North Star on Hotels.com. It was ideally located near where we parked our car and only 2minutes in a taxi (yes we could have walked)away from the theatre. The hotel arranged our taxi and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. The hotel is situated not far from O Connell street also. Will definitely stay again! Thank you!,5,2018,10,13
219,"Great location, room was terrible","We had a suite here, a big beautiful room, but everything was wrong with it. The toilet wouldn't flush, like it would take 5 or 6 flushes to take away one small bit of paper. Terrible. The sink wouldn't drain, and washing hands and brushing teeth needed to be done with the most minimum amount of water or the sink would fill up. The hairdryer and iron didn't work. Yep, we actually wanted to use both, but couldn't. And the floor! Every square inch was creaky. A bathroom trip in the middle of the night would wake up a dead person with all the noise. The food was good, the service good, the location excellent, I just wish I had gotten another room.",3,2018,10,11
219,"Comfortable, spacious, well positioned hotel","Had a 4 night break in Dublin with friend. 
Great hotel and close to centre of Dublin. Transport links right by hotel.
There is nothing negative I can say about thus hotel.
The rooms are very spacious and clean. 
The staff are very friendly and helpful.
There is a club room that has complementary continental breakfast and wine and cheese and biscuits in the evening.
Would definitely return to this hotel",5,2018,10,10
219,Great hotel in Dublin,We had wonderful customer service from the start to finish of our stay!  Our flight had arrived very early in the morning and the staff did all they could to accommodate us early.  We especially appreciated their efforts because we were traveling with our 10 month old daughter.  They allowed us to check in early and even upgraded our room.  The room was very comfortable and we were able to request a cot for the baby.  They have a very nice breakfast downstairs in the morning and we were close to the city center.  We would definitely come back and stay here again!,5,2018,10,09
219,Lovely stay ,"It was my first time staying here despite passing it so often. 
Very impressed. 
Lovely large reception area. Check in was quick and a really nice lady checking us in. 
Room was fine, very comfortable bed. Never a huge fan of shower over bath - but a very nice shower still. 
Room very warm and air con not the easiest to work out! We did tho and managed to cool it down. 
Break fast was good, very tempted by pancakes but went for booked breakfast. Filling and nice - and Sunday papers there which I love. 
Biggest shout out tho to the staff. Without exception they were friendly and helpful - noticeably so. 
Will definitely be back. ",4,2018,10,09
219,great hotel,"A very comfortable hotel with helpful and friendly staff.The room was very well equipped, very clean and extremely quiet.The Hotel is very close to bus and tram routes.The restaurant, however, is a bit chaotic, and ran out of some puddings early on.",5,2018,10,09
219,Lovely Stay ,"Lovely, clean hotel which has been recently renovated. The staff were all very friendly and the rooms were spacious with great facilities - the club lounge is a lovely touch as well with continental breakfast available on a morning! ",5,2018,10,09
219,Very impressed with the quality of the hotel.,"I was very impressed with the quality of the rooms, the on-site gym as well as the food on offer. Its also an excellent location being next to Connolly train station, the Dart and Luas. I'll definitely be staying again.",5,2018,10,09

219,Fantastic weekend,"Good hotel and exceptional location very close to centre.
Around 20 minutes walking  to the heart of Dublin (Temple area, shopping area and restaurants.
The staff of hotel is very kind and friendly.
The rooms are very comfortable and enough space.
It's a beautiful hotel.
",4,2018,10,08
219,Nice hotel,"Was wary about booking through Authentic Vacations and the quality of the hotels for our trip but so far so good. North Star is a gem and is so unassuming from the outside. Rooms are equivalent to an Ametican boutique hotel with marble bathroom floors. Well equipped and very comfortable. Bedding is your to par with Hilton, Marriott or Kimpton. Breakfast was amazing and free! Over medium eggs were perfectly done. Bacon, yogurt and jams were above par. I can't say the same for the coffee but that's ok. There are plenty of outlets for gourmet coffee near the hotel. Great first stop in Dublin!",5,2018,10,08
219,Very bad food and the worst service ,"Pizza was burnt (as it can be seen on the pic ) ... I was trying to get the attention of the waitresses (short girl, black hair, very impolite) but didn‚Äôt succeed.... after a long day of traveling, I had few slices and left by paying the entire pizza... well a place never to dine again... ",1,2018,10,07
219,Fall stay,Was a wonderful place to stay.  Walking distance to several sites.  Staff were very friendly.  The rooms were very clean.  The parlor cafe had great service and several healthy options for a lite breakfast.,5,2018,10,06
219,Relaxing retreat in central Dublin,"We spent five nights at The Address in late September/early October 2018. The hotel is well kept and more than adequately staffed. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of our room and what must be the largest bathroom I've ever had on a trip to Europe. The rooms are high tech but, more important, they're comfortable and quiet. The club level enjoys some very nice perks, including a rooftop deck and lounge with a fancy coffee machine, free continental breakfast and a wine and cheese reception in the evening. Staff members were super helpful, by and large, and allowed us to use the health club for a shower so we could freshen up on the morning we arrived. The location, right across from Connolly Station, provides easy access to trams, regional trains and buses. We would absolutely stay here again.",5,2018,10,06
219,Very comfortable stay,"Haven't stayed at the North Star for a couple of years so very impressed by the enhancements to the hotel. First stayed there in 1988 and it's certainly different, in a very good way, than it was then.Our room/suite was excellent, nicely furnished, good bathroom, good(ish) views. Restaurant food  was good as was the fast & friendly service ditto for the bar. Not a lot else to say - no complaints & will definitely stay at the North Star again.",5,2018,10,06
219,Vacation,"Great hotel, great staff, rooms and restaurants are top shelf for price range.  

David in the restaurant was superb and funny!  Food was very tasty and good value.

Location is good for city center walking and across the street from train station.",5,2018,10,06
219,Great Stay,"Great stay in central location, clean spacious room with all mod cons. the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. special mention to Keith who was extremely engaging in the restaurant. The service upon arrival and departure was very accommodating and the food as always was excellent.",4,2018,10,04
219,Beautiful hotel 1 noisy problem ,"Booked this hotel for its handy location to Dublin City centre attractions. 
The hotel is beautiful and in an ideal location for public transport including the airlink bus from Dublin airport. The Address is part of The North Star hotel and advertised as a superior part of the hotel, and although we never saw any of the North Star rooms, we were more than satisfied with the design of the room, it had everything we needed and more. The friendly staff showed us around the room and how to use all the gadgets. If you don‚Äôt need a big breakfast. The complimentary breakfast in the rooftop lounge is more than ample (croissants, fruit, yoghurts, teas and coffee) 
Our room had one SERIOUS downside. The train track runs at the same level as the 3rd floor (we were in room 329) and the trains seemed to run constantly from around 6am til midnight. If you don‚Äôt mind an early rise, this won‚Äôt be problematic, however it really put a damper on our few days away. The other side of the hotel may not have the same problem. 
Would I stay again? Hmmmm, only if I could request a room away from the train tracks as we paid a fair amount for the room. ",3,2018,10,03
219,Classy and slightly out of the ordinary,"Room was high quality, very classy and excellent value for money. Only negative was the lack of a kettle!  Teabags were provided, but no means of heating water, unless there is some way of using the coffee maker, but the instructions only covered making coffee with the capsules provided.",4,2018,10,03
219,Nice Folks!,"After a rough flight from NY, we arrived exhausted. They were kind enough to make ready a room before check-in. If you have a choice, don't get the first floor. The street behind is very busy with noise. The food was excellent there. Danyul at the desk was very kind. He was helpful for everything. We would stay again (not first floor)!",4,2018,10,03
219,Exceptional,We were offered a suite on arrival and feeling weary accepted and pAid the extra cost. 10 times the size of our London accomodation. The location was just outside of hustle and bustle of city but in easy walking distance to all that we wanted to see.,5,2018,10,03
219,NO A/C and poor response,"We checked into our room in the middle of Sept. The room was very warm and an hour later after turning on the A/C there was no change. We called and someone came to say there is nothing to be done; the A/C was disconnected for servicing for the next few days
No one told us this upon checking in and the front office response was to give us a small fan with a missing front safety guard. The window only opened an couple of inches so the evening was very uncomfortable.
The next day the GM found us another room with A/C",2,2018,10,02
219,Lovely room,"I really liked the room. It was spacious and clean. The bathroom was a bit small for showering. There was a fridge and safe. Lots of room and the bed was comfortable. However, although it was only a few kilometers to the Spire, the location under the railroad tracks made it seem like the it was blowing a gale all night. The staff were not at all friendly. We didn't like to go out after dark.",3,2018,10,02
219,Wonderful Location and Amenities!,"Location was perfect for what we wanted. The entrance and common areas are as beautiful as the pictures. We like to feel like we are in the neighborhood over the touristy area. The tech in the room was my reason for booking it. My boyfriend is a tech guy and loved it. The rooftop was awesome as well. If it was not cold when we visited we would have spent some serious time using it. Hidden gym is the sauna! Every night was able to change into my swim suite and chill in it all alone. It was dreamy! 

Only things I'd change : Gym needs to be updated. The equipment is old as dirt but still clean and in good shape. The 2nd thing would be the cool sensor night lights need to be lighter. When you put your feet out the bed the night lights are so bright the whole room lights up waking up the other person.",5,2018,10,02
219,Great Location !,"I would be giving this hotel 5 stars if their AC was working during our stay or if they had informed us/tried to make accommodations. Anyways, besides that minor factor it was a great short stay.This is a fantastic location and easy to get to if you are flying into Dublin Airport - the Connolly train station is literally across the street. However, taxis are easily to flag down at the hotel and throughout your entire stay. Interior is very nice and quaint. We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel but there are many options and breakfast is available. Aside from a full breakfast offered they also have a cafe with quick bites, a bakery and coffee. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The concierge staff helped us plan our days and navigate the city. I would recommended this hotel and would return !",4,2018,10,02
219,Great Hotel with Fabulous Food,"A group of us stay at this hotel and we all had a wonderful time.

The hotel has a fantastic fresh, clean look, the rooms were modern, and had all the amenities you need.

The bar area looked new, with very friendly bar staff and had a great atmosphere, and the food was to die for, very delicious. 

It's location is great, with only a 20 minute walk into the city center.  

We're definitely used again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2018,10,02
219,Lovely Hotel,"We decided to upgrade to the Address side of the hotel to a Club Twin.  The rooms were modern and very nice!  We loved that you could open the curtains from your bed!  The only downside to the room was that it overlooked a train track and from early on a morning you could hear the trains going by......something I would not expect from paying for an upgrade!!!This room gave access to the roof terrace with a small continental breakfast, tea/coffee, water and juices.  Between 6.30pm - 7.30pm there was also wine and a small selection of cheeses.  The hotel restaurant bar was very nice and highly recommended!",4,2018,10,02
219,"Clean, convenient location and friendly service!","We enjoyed our stay here very much. Rooms were very clean and service was friendly. We really enjoyed the evening reception where you can have a complimentary glass of wine. The only downfall is that the hotel is not in the greatest area but we never felt unsafe walking around. It was only a short walk to the city centre which was very convenient. Overall, great hotel and we would defiantly stay here again.",5,2018,10,01
219,Great hotel,"I booked a twin room for myself and my sister and everything was perfect. The location is excellent and easy to get there by the Luas.  We really enjoyed our stay , lovely room with everything you 'd need , just tissues missing from the bathroom. I will definitely be back PG , I'v already booked a night in December.",5,2018,10,01
219,"The property is nice, the location is not.","The room was fine with modern amenities.  

The breakfast is nice but having a machine that makes one pancake at a time for a large group for buffet breakfasts is not practical and it was out of order half of the time we were there.  

There is not much variety in terms of food at the connected pub or in the small ""Parlor"", but there is really not much variety in any of the restaurants or pubs in Dublin.  The service was poor in the pub on some nights.

The biggest complaint is the location.  The hotel is located in a run-down area of Dublin and it is kind of sketchy, particularly at night.

There was noise because we had a room right over the train tracks but we got used to it after a day or so.",3,2018,10,01
219,Awesome accommodation,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The North Star Dublin. Extremely clean room and the hospitality was honourable especially the Concierge Kieren lovely welcoming personality and extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend if ever you are in Dublin stay at The North Star.,5,2018,09,30
219,Highly recommended!,"My friend and I stayed at Address 1 for three nights, and we didn't want to leave! The rooms are fantastic (I didn't realise I wanted to be able to open and close my curtains through a touchpad next to the bed but now I'm home I begrudge having to do it myself!) and the beds were so comfortable. The club lounge was also an unexpected bonus with a lovely atmosphere! I'd definitely recommend and will hopefully be back!",5,2018,09,30
219,North Star shines,I stayed at the North Star for an overnight trip to Dublin. Its location was central and convenient for everywhere.  The staff were friendly and extremely helpful and attentive. The hotel had a quirkiness which was refreshing at a time when most hotels are bland and boring. The decor showed a uniqueness and resonance of a time when the North Star rail system was part of it. I look forward to staying here again. ,5,2018,09,29
219,Good hotel,Hotel staff were very nice the room was lovely with a large tv. The breakfast was good and plentiful.  The only problem was the location as the area is very rough.  We were there for a concert in the 02 so it was very close and yes I would consider staying here again.,4,2018,09,29
219,Excellent,"Excellent  service and staff, our 7th floor room was beautifully  decorated and well presented with very tasty chocolates courtesy  of the hotel. The guest lounge and balcony were a very nice touch,wine and nibbles in evening and continental breakfast in morning.",5,2018,09,28
219,Highly recommend! ,"The hotel was spotless, lovely room as well. Reception very helpful and accommodating, we were able to leave our suitcases on arrival and departure due to our flight times. The bars were nice to have a drink/coffee before going out as well. We were offered upgrades on checking in which we didn‚Äôt opt for but the room was nicer than I was expecting. We didn‚Äôt choose breakfast as you are only a 15 minute walk from the centre. Would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone. The area itself is better than I was expecting having read previous reviews, there are a couple of cafes and pubs nearby as well as it being the main route from the 747 airport bus so no hassle with that at all. As long as you don‚Äôt mind a walk into town or a ‚Ç¨10 taxi, well worth a visit. ",5,2018,09,27
219,Excellent,Excellent set up. I stayed in the hotel before the facelift and now it‚Äôs much better. The food is superb as was David who served us in the restaurant and bar area. Roundstone Ale is a must try in the bar. ,5,2018,09,27
219,Lovely stay,We had a lovely stay again in The North Star Hotel. The only thing I would recommend changing is the sensor lights in the rooms they are extremely bright and come on even if you just drop an arm over the bed. ,4,2018,09,27
219,Amazing Customer Service - Beautiful Hotel - Very Comfortable!,"We had such a lovely time at The North Star Hotel. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Our room was amazing. We had stayed at The North Star around this time last year while there was some construction work underway. During that time was some noise and the room we had an older room that hadn't yet been updated. We weren't extremely happy with our star that time for obvious reasons but were given a discount and moved to a new room, and offered to stay again this year with an upgraded room.So we did book again this year and we were amazed but how well were looked after. We were upgraded to the James Joyce Suite which included free chocolates, wine and a very surprising delivery of two slices of very tasty cake that were delivered to the room unexpectedly.The suite was amazing on the top floor of the hotel with a very comfortable bed and loads of space to relax and enjoy the wine, chocolate and cake. The experience more than made up for our troubles the previous year. The hotel work is complete now and the place looks amazing. I would recommend anyone to visit the North Star Hotel if staying in Dublin.A big thanks to all of the staff at North Star Hotel for making our stay amazing!",5,2018,09,26
219,Short stay on way to airport.,"We had an enjoyable stay although only one night.  We were at the end of our 2 week Ireland trip.  I booked Northstar since it was a 7 minute walk to the Airlink service to the airport.  When we checked in, we were upgraded to a suite!  Too bad we didn‚Äôt have a week at this hotelüòÄ.  The suite was very roomy and bright.  We also ate at McGettigans Cookhouse and Bar which was also very good. ",5,2018,09,26
219,Fine overall,"Stayed for 3 nights with 11 year old son in late August. Hotel was a little dark in the reception area/lobby, but staff were nice enough, and room was comfortable. The concierge was lovely and went out of his way to help us figure out how to get to the train station during the morning of the Pope's speech in Phoenix Park, when the city was basically shut down. The hotel's system of getting to the rooms is a bit complicated, since some upscale rooms use a special elevator which is not labeled so is not self-evident...and we somehow used it once but then got confused. We eventually figured out the system but it seemed unduly complicated. Overall a nice stay, just not spectacular.",4,2018,09,25
219,Disappointing stay,"We have just got home from a weekend at this hotel. Check in was quick, rooms and hotel are clean and modern. Communication is extremely poor, we rang reception to order us a taxi two hours before we wanted one, we got to reception and they confirmed it was booked.. 15 minutes later we ask where the taxi is for them to say they couldn‚Äôt get us one although they did not tell us!! They rang a taxi company and once came within the next 15 minutes?? Last night we tried to have room service, ringing reception four times with them saying they‚Äôd call us back we gave up!! We ended up ordering food from outside the hotel and one of the girls confronted the front of house staff about the lack of help.",2,2018,09,24
219,North Star ,"Dublin is a picturesque city .Hotel is located in the heart of the city is connected well with train, trams and buses. Good service , Staffs are polite and helpful ... had a few problems with AC and other issues which was rectified expensive city so over all good experience . ",4,2018,09,23
219,Couples Getaway,Great service and everything was modern and new would be 5 stars but a woman named Ella at the front desk was a bit snarky and rude but a guy named Keith showed us to our room and took our bags and showed us how to use everything and helped us with anything we needed after would also recommend visiting the in house bar Aidan and Liam were really nice and funny definitely will be back ,4,2018,09,21
219,Definitely would come back,"The service and rooms at this hotel are excellent. I was a little unsure about the location but it was a convenient 10min walk to the Spire. The club lounge had nice views, the complimentary breakfast was light with croissants and fruit, yoghurt, biscuits. I chose this hotel for the sauna and was a bit disappointed to find the saunas were in the male and female change rooms. ",5,2018,09,21
219,"Nice, central hotel","I found this a nice hotel, central and convienient.  All the expected items were on hand and of good quality.  The only small negatives were the TV picture could have been clearer, and the floor was a bit squeaky.  Lovely breakfast!",4,2018,09,20
219,NorthStar went South ,"We stayed here for 4 nights to tour Dublin. 
1) There are some advertised perks to being a guest . I asked about these perks in the Parlor and also asked two staff at reception. No one knew what I was talking about and when I pointed out a sign about it in elevator I was told we did not qualify. Management needs to work with staff to understand hotel policies. 
2) we were notified by a letter under the door 
that there would be no more a/c due to scheduled maintenance . that night there  was also construction going on outside the window and the noise was deafening even with the window closed. I called reception four times and was told repeatedly that a fan was on the way. The fan arrived after I got really upset at 3am. The hotel did not plan adequetely for this a/c shut down and its inexcusable. there was no effort on the part of staff to make this right ... or manageable, for the guests. 
3) water was dumped on my luggage, from an awning being put down. i was tired from no sleep and waiting for my airport cab. a reception staff member came out and said sorry with a smirk on her face. 
no paper towel or offer to help . 

those are the facts. northstar was the only place we stayed in our weeks in ireland where we encountered lack of hospitality and bad attitudes from staff . I cannot recommend this hotel unless there is major radical improvement.
Thats why its a one  star. Very dissappointing. 
Being treated badly is never a good value. 
Rather than create a false narrative management first needs to apologize and look into how to correct these issues. 
the photos are the view right outside my window, at 2am. ",1,2018,09,18
219,Poor service and ........,"We too stayed during the air conditioning outage and the rooms were hot.  Things like this are too be expected, when travelling.   Our issues stemmed from the lack of promised service.  When we asked for tissue staff said right away but twice it never showed.  When we asked if the small makeup mirror could be fixed, staff replied yes.  However, nobody ever showed.  I should also mention the area around the hotel is not all that safe after dark, an assessment that was confirmed by a nearby store security guard.   The good news is there is a laundry within a 3 min walk.  Drop your laundry off at 8:30 and it is ready by  13:00h.  I should also note that the bathroom water facets were great and that there was hot water.",3,2018,09,18
219,Good location but noisy if you get a room over the DART train,"This is probably a decent hotel. However, when we stayed (September 2018), the HVAC system was turned off. Our room was 86 F, which is very uncomfortable. A door to the balcony could be opened to circulate some air, but the balcony was common to a string of rooms, so we did not feel comfortable leaving the door open while we toured the city. The room we were assigned overlooked the DART train which ran well into the night, so it was too noisy to leave the door open for cooling at night. The floors creak badly, the safe in our room did not work (Maintenance man tried to fix but could not), and the bathroom door would not latch closed.",2,2018,09,17
219,Club Suite Stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights for a birthday treat and it was wonderful. 

I booked a club suite as they looked incredible on photos and upon our arrival we was not disappointed. The room had many modern features such as sensory lights, electric curtains and a control panel on the television which was shown when being introduced to the suite. We was above the rail line but this did not contribute much noise at night and gave us some good views. The room was very clean and the towels where very soft. They even gave us a birthday card and a box of chocolates! 

We tried the cookhouse restaurant was Devine and has good service too! We also had access to the rooftop lounge where we had cheese and wines at night over looking the city which was a great touch! 

The location is good for the airport and the train station however, it is a good 20 minute walk out to get to the main tourist areas such as temple bar and O‚ÄôConnell street with bus tours etc.

We would come here again. Many thanks! 
",5,2018,09,17
219,family birthday,"we stayed here at the weekend and the hotel was so nice from location, the staff and a special thank you to Daniel at reception who looked after my requests [and Martin the concierge].We ate in the bar/restaurant and the food was fab.Very central to everything.Only thing i had a problem with was the lights that come on in the bedroom when u move literally in the bed I am not a heavy sleeper  so this did get on my nerves a bit.",5,2018,09,17
219,End of a CIE tour,"We had just completed a wonderful tour of Southern Ireland. Planned two extra nights here on our own. Hotel has turned off Air Conditioning. It is unbearable in rooms. Everyone is uncomfortable. We will be letti

ast room also below par. Little things like no Kleenex and no refill of water jug. All standard everywhere else we stay

Hotel has turned off A.C. Unbearable in rooms. Service and food in breakfast room also below par. 

",2,2018,09,16
219,John,"We arrived after an overseas flight overnight.  
We thought this was a nice hotel when they seemed to make special efforts to get us to our room before check in time.  When we got to tje room it was 27 deg.C and there was a note saying the a/c was being serviced and did not work.  Needless to say even after being up for 24 hrs we only got a few hours sleep.  The next morning none of the outlets in the room worked and my wife had to go out with wet hair.  That afternoon they got the outlets working but it was still hot in the room.  We requested a fan be brought to our room and they brought one that did not even have a cover on the blade.  All I have heard from the other guests are complaints as we‚Äôll. 
We had to leave the window cracked the whole 2‚Äù it would open and all night the hotel staff smoking area and chat location was right below our room.",1,2018,09,16
219,TOO HOT!,"Loved the hotel, staff and the restaurant - sadly, the cellar bar where we had breakfast was BOILING hot and v stuffy and uncomfortable.... Also, we were unable to order any soft drinks down there - its a weird thing of mine that I have coke with brekki (sugar rush needed) and were told we had to go to the bar and order ourselves.",4,2018,09,11
219,Review,"Hotel was beautiful,we had a lovely stay the staff were so friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel was great would highly recommended to friends and family and would certainly stay again the next time we‚Äôre in Dublin ",5,2018,09,08
219,Took a chance!,"We arrived tired and had a lot of luggage as we had taken a cruise before flying to Dublin.  The staff got us checked in quickly and they brought up the luggage.  After resting a bit we went down to their restaurant, which was packed, to get a quick bite.  The hostess went out of her way to get us a table.......she asked a local couple that frequents often if they would share their table with us.  Great experience as they gave us great suggestions on places to go and gave us some Dublin history.

The hotel is located near the train station and the hop on hop off bus.  Other restaurants are close by.

Beds were very fresh and comfortable, room was clean and the only complaint is that the air did not cool the room to our liking, however, with all the good the air does not justify taking a star away!!",5,2018,09,07
219,Comfortable and central,"We recently stayed at the north star and found the staff very friendly and welcoming, the hotels location was really easy and convenient for walking into dublin city centre and pubs/restaurants.The room was comfortable,hotel clean, lovely reception and decoration.Breakfast was fine plenty of choice.recommend if you are happy to have 10 mins walk to explore.",5,2018,09,04
219,weekend break,"chose this hotel for its location and ease of getting to from airport.  We arrived at 1000hrs not expecting to get our room till afternoon, So pleased to be greeted by the news that our room would be ready shortly and we had been given an upgrade to the new rooms!
Shown around the room to realise this was hi tech and full of positive surprises. huge bed, electric curtains, stat of the art lighting system and heating/air con. complimentary continental breakfast and free entry to the exec suite on the top floor.
modern pod coffee machine in room,
No noise in night.  Excellent concierge desk helping us to get about efficiently, hotel bar and restaurant also good.  cant find a bad thing to say about our stay",5,2018,09,03
219,Weekend trip to Dublin,"The Address is a new, very nice hotel with good service and ample amenities.
Just a short walk to the city or if you want to go a bit further the tram is a cross the street. Clean rooms, very comfortable beds and a generous breakfast buffet.
Very good experience and for sure on the list for another visit!",5,2018,09,03
219,"Lovely hotel close to Connelly Station, but a fit far from city centre","The rough neighborhood and plain exterior do not prepare you for the very swanky and modern hotel inside, including McGettigans restaurant. It really is a very nice hotel with professional staff that look sharp and are quick to respond to requests etc. They even smile and greet guests when they come in, which is quite rare these days. We were quite tired on our first day and ate at the McGettigans, and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the very personal service of the staff. Prices were not cheap, but it was a proper dining experience. 
As others have said, the location is handy near the train station and public transport, but we prefer to walk and it was about a 20 minute walk to get to the city centre and places like Trinity College and Temple Bar, so somewhat far when you want to go out and still have a long walk back at night.

The rooms are very luxurious and immaculately maintained, but we had four specific complaints about the facilities which are more the fault of the designers and not the staff at all: 1) Wifi signal was extremely weak, causing major irritation when trying to plan the next day's itinerary; 2) the shower/bath handles to turn on/off the hot water was very slippery and difficult to turn when wet, as the design favors stylish appearance over utility; 3) the A/C control panel is completely impossible to understand, even if you have an advanced degree; 4) there are sensor-activated floor lights, which again sound very modern and sophisticated, but in practice means every time a blanket falls or you put your feet down to go to the bathroom, all the floor lights turn on at night and wake up your family members!

All in all we were pleased with the high quality of the rooms and professional demeanor of the staff, but felt the modern designs were not very practical in some ways, which is not the case just for this hotel but in general. In either case, if these things could be fixed, we would consider give 5 stars.",4,2018,09,02
219,Service,"Last night I had dinner in the restaurant with my family. I must say the food and service was excellent. 
The girl who served was was Alexandra, she was really chatty and very friendly, and she conducted her job in a very professional manner. 
She is a beautiful lady, and she would be one of the reasons I would return to your restaurant. 
Well done to Alexandra, and complements to the chef.",5,2018,09,02
219,Convenient to public transportation. Good service.  Dodgy location,"Spent four nights at the North Star.  The hotel was lovely; the breakfast was good.  We had some issues with our room, but it was our own fault that we didn't ask them to fix the problems.  Overall, the staff was very professional and accomodating.  A quick walk across the street and you can jump on the Luas which will get you around town (I highly recommend the leap card).  The only real complant is that that it really isn't one of the nicer parts of town, I was even warned by a cabbie to hold my purse close in that area.",4,2018,09,01
219,Great hotel,"Nice hotel, good location in terms of public transport and stops and nice room - no complaints at all! Decor in reception  is great too! Didn‚Äôt eat there so unable to comment but the bar were always giving out freebies which tasted great! ",5,2018,08,30
219,Very Nice----Once Inside the Front Door,"After finding the parking lot a few blocks away and figuring out how to pay the machine, we came to a busy part of town that seemed pretty old and somewhat dated. However, a lot of other spots in town are similar, so we decided that location was ok after all. The hotel entrance is among store fronts (rather than standing alone) but is easy to find if you look up about 8 feet and see the reasonably large sign. Once inside, a big surprise awaits-----it is very clean and very modern. The lobby and restaurants are such a contrast to the outside world.
     Our room was not large, but it was comfortable and clean. The safe and small fridge were welcome touches that are not always found in many other places. The bathroom amenities were sparse, but we have our own----so no problem for us. The breakfast buffet was good and very typical, There was sausage and ham for meats, lots of fruits, plenty of pastries, coffee in a carafe, etc.
     Finally, there are many shops, bars, and eateries for many blocks around the hotel. The Temple Bar area is about a 20 minute walk (at a mild pace). The walk is easy because of sidewalks, and people are everywhere!
     We would not mind staying here again, if we return to Dublin!",4,2018,08,30
219,Lovely hotel in no so lovely location,"Nice hotel with lovely staff but our room was in spitting distance of the train line...noisy! Very handy for tram and only about 20 minutes walk from the centre. Area was a little run down, but taxi drivers told me it is an improving area. Room was comfortable with all the expected facilities. Foyer welcoming with a sitting area.",3,2018,08,30
219,Almost a Good Hotel,"The entry way has been redesigned and is lovely, I stayed in both parts of the hotel in premier and Club rooms at ' The Address'.  The rooms were lovely in both, recently refurbished.  The breakfast was good for buffet standards and the room is was served in was charming.  So why only 3 stars?  They spent so much time and money giving this place a fantastic vibe and appearance only to staff it with the least customer service qualified hotel staff I have ever encountered.  I'm not including wait staff or hotel maintenance and cleaning staff,  primarily the front desk and anyone who would supposed to be handling the 'customer satisfaction ' side of things.  I was in both lounges, neither were ever stocked.  At any point of the day.  You might find an apple and a bottle of water if you were lucky.  The front desk messed up my reservation - and tried to play it off by saying they had upgraded me.  I paid for and requested a balcony with a view - I was 'upgraded' to a nice room, with no balcony and a view of the dumpster.  They were constantly disorganized and seems stressed and on their back foot any time you went to the front desk.  I'm sorry, I cannot recommend this place until they dramatically improve their hiring and training processes.",3,2018,08,29
219,Fantastic hotel ,"The room was really clean and spacious, we really enjoyed staying at the North Star. All the staff including restaurant staff were friendly. 
The only let down is parking isn‚Äôt available for the hotel, we found a car park about a 5 minute walk away at the Irish life centre which was reasonably priced. 
On my return to Dublin I would stay at the North Star hotel again and would recommend to family and friends. ",5,2018,08,29
219,Stunning and Modern,"Stayed here for a long weekend and it was absolutely brilliant. The hotel is modern and luxurious with a number of lovely finishing touches to the room such a throws, cushions and complimentary snacks and water. The whole hotel was immaculate and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin and I'll certainly be staying again.",5,2018,08,28
219,Cracking,"Stayed here 24th to 26th Aug unfortunately coinciding with the Pope's visit which meant Dublin was extremely busy. Fortunately we were at the Address. Lovely room spotlessly clean and the tech was unbelievable. We prepaid for the breakfast and didn't have any problem with the key card. Wonderful selection for breakfast my only minor gripe would be the toaster. We ate at the hotel in the evening lovely food each night. We drank in the bar as well apart from a couple of hours on Sunday night when we sampled Temple Bar, well you have to don't you, lovely Guinness. Thanks to all your staff especially Sarah in the restaurant and Sean and the lads behind the bar you truly made us welcome. ",5,2018,08,28
219,Great hotel,"Airlink bus from airport stops 3 mins away. DART railway opposite. Walk to river 15 mins.
Rooms high tech and very clean.
7th floor roof free coffee bar open 24 hours. My husband said it‚Äôs the best coffee he‚Äôs had üòÄ",5,2018,08,27
219,Stayed here for 4 night.  Very good spot to be.  Easy to walk to almost everything.,"We booked into this hotel for 4 nights.  I can't say enough good things about this place - except for one front desk staff member.

Arrived for overseas flight around 9:00 am.  When we went to the desk to enquire about having our bags secured (as we were informed via e-mail that it was possible) the lady at the desk immediately told me that we couldn't check in until 2:00 pm.   She then proceeded to pull off some sticky paper with number for us to  place on our bags and keep a copy.  Told us in no uncertain terms where we were to leave the bags for safe keeping.  (This happened Thursday August 23)

The bar staff, the housekeeping staff, the porters, the other front desk staff were all wonderful.

If you get the chance, then order the buffet breakfast that is available in to the basement of the building - you won't be disappointed

The second time we had dealing with the lady at the front desk was when our friends checked in to the ""sister"" hotel.  (Note: North Star and Address 1 are connected hotels.)

We mentioned to the lady that one of the light bulbs had burnt out.  We were told, again in no uncertain terms, that nothing could be done until the day we were leaving - as no maintenance staff were on duty on the weekend.  (This happened Saturday Aug 25th)

Even though this may sound like a grumpy review - keep in mind that the vast majority of the staff were wonderful.

I'd stay here again.",4,2018,08,27
219,"Surprisingly Good, a little let down by odd pay as you go practice","I'm a dubliner so Amien St isn't the first place I'd think of staying but honestly this hotel is very good. Very modern, great breakfast and facilities. The bedrooms are lovely and modern with great furnishings. Room service accommodated my keto alteration to my order which was a big thumbs up. Wait staff are very nice.

Disappointing Areas: I did get asked to produce my key card by the reception/concierge staff as I made my way from reception to the breakfast which I found rather rude, but it didn't spoil the stay. In addition, I couldn't pay for room service when I was checking out and had to pay every time in my room. Same for breakfast, I had to go and buy a token at reception to pay for breakfast (quite inconvenient). The two key cards would drive most people crazy (one to access the corridors and one to access the room with no marker to distinguish the two.)",3,2018,08,23
219,Dublin Mini Break,"We had a lovely 2 night stay at the hotel.  Our room was in ""The Address @ Dublin 1"" annex (Club Room) and highly recommend it.  Spacious, comfortable, clean and quiet - the essentials for any hotel stay.  Club lounge services, with roof top patio, great for morning coffee and evening refreshments.  Convenient location: across from Connolly Train Station, trams, financial/waterfront district and a pleasant 10 min walk to Temple Bar area.  Friendly front desk and nice bar for evening meal and/or cocktail.  Enjoyed our stay and will go back when visiting Dublin again.",5,2018,08,22
219,You Saved Our Vacation!,"I want to personally thank the management and staff at The North Star/Address hotels. When we booked our trip to Dublin, we simply did it on expedia and went with a hotel that seemed like it was decent and in a central location. The other hotel was, infact, okay and centrally located. What we didn‚Äôt know is staying in Temple Bar would mean no sleep and constant exhaustion. Our first night at the other hotel had us up until 4:00 a.m. with the night club right below. The next night was a similar experience. We also had to keep the windows open because there was no AC and we needed the cool air. Needless to say, after 2 nights at this hotel we realized we couldn‚Äôt stay there anymore. It would have ruined our vacation. If we were in our 20‚Äôs and staying out late and having a party vacation, this other hotel would be fine but we are well into our 40s and not looking for that type of vacation.

We decided to look for a better hotel in a quieter part of town. That is when we came across the North Star. After reading reviews, we booked the hotel the 3rd day of our trip and checked out of the other hotel (they were actually very understanding about our situation). Before check in, we decided to just walk over to the North Start to check it out and see what it was like. When we talked to the front desk and told the staff our experience up until this point, they were super understanding and accommodating. Not only did they understand our situation, but they upgraded us to one of the high tech rooms in The Address and made sure we had a super quiet room. Once we checked in, our vacation changed dramatically! We had a BEAUTIFUL room that was quiet, cool and comfortable. We were able to enjoy a wonderful vacation from that moment forward and I have the staff at the North Star and The Address to thank for it. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin that wants a comfortable night sleep in a quieter part of town that is also in a great area to access trains and busses. We would definitely stay here again when we come back to Dublin.

We also had some wonderful meals in the restaurant attached to the hotel and some great conversations with the staff at the restaurant. Very delightful people. We loved our visit to Dublin and some of the surrounding areas and can‚Äôt wait to come back! 

Thank you so much for saving our vacation!",5,2018,08,19
219,Luxurious Room,"Loved this hotel room. Most comfortable bed ever and finally a decent sized bed.

Food was pretty average... definitely eat elsewhere.

Parking is non existent!!!! 

Area is ok... walkable to caf√©s etc.

All in all.... pretty good.",4,2018,08,17
219,Business trip,"Very nice hotel. Pity about the location. Staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were all newly renovated. Bar is nice but only a small choice of beers. Chicken wings were nice and enjoyable. Room was very warm though and couldn‚Äôt get the ac going. Overall though. Nice spot. 
Enjoy",4,2018,08,14
219,Mini break,"Just come back from a wonderful 2 night break in Dublin staying in this lovely hotel with my daughter. 
We arrived at about 11am hoping to be able to drop our bags off before checking in later that day. To our delight after a wait of just 10 minutes (spent in the beautiful coffee shop) a very helpful man on reception, I think his name was Daniel, informed us our room was ready for us. Our room was perfect, spotlessly clean and obviously recently refurbished. 
The reception area of the hotel is particularly lovely with the brick work of the railway arch a major feature.
The staff were all very helpful and friendly, always ready with a hello. I must also mention who Boris who arranged for our problem with a faulty flush on our toilet to be fixed within the hour, it was during the evening too so we were very grateful to him.
All in all a fabulous stay and would definitely stay again. Great location too! ",5,2018,08,13
219,Amazing,Would recommend staying here..great location. Ten min walk to o connell street and temple bar. Every kind of shop you should need on the same street. Staff friendly and professional. Clean spacious rooms. Beautiful lobby and bar area. ,5,2018,08,13
219,Excellent accommodation,"My wife and I stayed in a premier double room which was extremely large and had the biggest bed I have ever slept in. The room was extremely quiet even with the air conditioning running, ( we stayed during a very hot spell). The private lounge which was located on our floor (7) was well stocked with complimentary breakfast, fruit, biscuits and hot and cold drinks throughout the day. Within easy distance for the shops, attractions and the river it is ideally located for a city break. This hotel comes highly recommended.",5,2018,08,12
219,Great location ,"Very clean hotel, staff helpful and friendly. Great location, beds extremely comfortable and the waterfall shower was a lovely surprise. Price was reasonable for free cancellation prices. Very impressed. 
",4,2018,08,11
219,Lovely Dublin Hotel with Great Location,"Beautiful, modern hotel in a central Dublin location. Easy walks to Trinity, convention center and town center, and also for pick-up locations for tours. Delicious little cafe as well! Large bathroom, too, with plenty of room for toiletries (unusual for my other European experiences). Our room was wonderfully quiet, too! Helpful staff accommodated us with a bag of snacks for our very early morning departures for tours. Lobby is gorgeous renovated train underpass!",4,2018,08,09
219,Irish hospitality and top management,"We may have had the cheapest room in the hotel and it was more than comfortable. Great bed, sparkling bathroom, fridge, coffee/tea service, excellent insulation, good a/c ‚Äì but the big plus in this hotel is the hospitality. Alert, bright, efficient staff, and a young manager always gracefully on the spot without making a show of ""managing."" Good restaurant, bar, coffee, pastries, all served by people who make you feel at home and who seem to actually like their jobs,  We'll be back to the North Star Hotel.",5,2018,08,09
219,"First time in Dublin, great stay.","Flew into Dublin on the 1st, and stayed there one night. We flew all night, and arrived at the hotel at 7:30am. We fully expected to just check our luggage and go site see. When we arrived, we were told that a room would be available in 30 minutes, and they gave us a voucher for free goodies in the Parlor. We had some coffee, went back, checked in and were told that we had been upgraded to The Adress side of the hotel. The room was a smart room, all new, very nice. Bed was very comfortable. Checked out the next morning,and let them know we would be back in a few days. Ion return, we were once again upgraded. Staff was all very nice, concierge was fantastic! Only hiccup was when we went to breakfast one morning, our key wouldn‚Äôt unlock the longe door, and we had to go take care of that. Otherwise it is a great hotel, and I would go back!",5,2018,08,08
219,Nice for a short stay,"We stayed here for two days. I liked the room, and location, but especially the air conditioning. The breakfast was really awful. The restaurant in front of the hotel was good. They gym was a nice surprise, but dark and dated. Overall a good stay. ",4,2018,08,08
219,One night of Luxury,"Stayed in the Address at Dublin 1 for one night, the service was excellent, a porter come up to your room to show you how the ""smart"" room works, the room was bright and cool on a hot day in Dublin.  Had food in the restaurant that night was really nice and breakfast was super also, would recommend",5,2018,08,07
219,Decent hotel,"Our travel agent sent us here after canceling our reservation at the Ashling Hotel. Fortunately, this hotel is nice. Not in a very clean part of north Dublin, the area is safe and relatively convenience to the historical attractions of Dublin. 

The bar is well stocked and reasonably prices. We found the dinner choices to be limited and lacking in the traditional Irish fate we were looking for bit the choices tastes good. 

Breakfast was included and featured a buffet, but a well done one. Good variety and very tasty. 

This hotel does not have a car park but there is a secure lot about two blocks away for ten euros a day. ",4,2018,08,06
219,Wonderful Boutique Hotel With Friendly Faces,Lovely place. The d√©cor is really nice and very eclectic. The staff was kind and efficient. The room was beautiful with all the newest gadgets with sensor lighting. The view from our room overlooking the railroad was nice and this is centrally located so you can get to anything very easily.,5,2018,08,05
219,A good point for staying in Dublin,"I attend a meeting at the Convention Center in Dublin and this is a good place to stay. The hotel is located a short distance from the Convention Center, the Airlink bus from the airport brings you a few steps from the hotel. Also the central bus station is close to the hotel.
We stay at the upper floors with accesses to the lounge that is a good place for spend evening time. The breakfast was excelent.
JUst take care to get a room at the upper floors in order to avoid the trains noise because the trains are running just in front of the hotel but at the upper floors the noise is hardly hear.
The hotel is located in an area with walking distance to the city center and to the Convention Center. 
The staff was very kind and cooperative.",5,2018,08,04
219,lovely decor-noisy room-unsure of location,"This hotel is so lovely inside. Parts built into railway tunnels so very unusual. Paid for standard twin but on arrival were upgraded to superior room. Great we thought. Extra facilities like a fridge/ coffee machine and access to a private lounge with complimentary tea/coffe and water. Room was lovely. Had iron and safe and air con also. Bathroom great . However when we arrived back in at around 11.45pm the noise and vibration in our room was so bad we couldnt possibly sleep. We were on floor 7. We called down to reception and someone came up and agreed it was really bad but had this sort of suprised look on his face as if they didnt know what its like. Apparently the aircon system for the whole hotel was above us (room 752). They were fully booked so we couldnt move on the Sat night. The next night it wasnt quite so bad so didnt bother to complain again. My other issue is its location. Directly opposite Connolly station which was not a problem. However, I found Talbot street very seedy at  night times which is something to consider if going to be on own or females only. Is fine during the day tho. Great bar and little coffee shop in lobby.All this said I really liked the hotel. Just wish you could pick it up and put it on O'Connell St",4,2018,08,02
219,"Despite few setbacks, its still worth giving it a second chance","location was a few steps away from 747 bus stop airlink from airport. check in was a breeze. front desk were nice and pleasant most of the time. the king club have access to the lounge.  during the morning, lounge had fresh fruits, yoghurt, pastries, machine for hot coffee or hot coco drink. don‚Äôt know what happened to the tripadvisor comment from management  way back May 30, 2017 about upgrading continental breakfast with smoked salmon, cheese, some cold meat? couldve been a big plus! upon check in, porter comes with you in the room to explain the automation going on with the switches of the room. my room location, altho facing inside, i  still slightly hear the train, but was not a bother at all. i guess its better to ask for room away from noise when you‚Äôre a light sleeper.  whatever was inside the fridge, it was complimentary and was a good touch.  i wasn‚Äôt told about the wine served around 6:00 pm at the lounge, not until i read a tripadvisor comment on my 5th night out of 7. but was able to join somehow for wine,grapes, cracker and cheese. was hoping i got told about it to begin with.  bed was comfy.  having a/c was a plus, which i learned that not all hotels have a/c, which at that time was useful due to high humidity. added security was the keycard being used to open the door to the lift and the hallway where the rooms were, as well as the lounge. wasnt able to check the gym and the sauna. tv froze one night,i called front desk and a porter came to fix it real quick! one night fire alarm went off at around 10pm.. who knows what went wrong, just glad nothing bad happened but an explanation could‚Äôve been a good gesture.  took a cab back to the airport that cost 26 euro. ",4,2018,08,02
219,Exceptionally friendly staff,"We stayed at The North Star twice on our trip to Dublin. The hotel is nice,but what impressed us most was the exceptionally friendly and helpful staff, especially the Deputy Manager and concierge who really put themselves out to help us ",4,2018,08,01
219,Not that Price worth,"All are very frendly and fast - reception staff as well as concierge and houskeeping and Service in the Lounge.

Rooms nice, Not very big (even if we were told these are of the bigger ones in Dunlin). However, windows cannot be opened, and train is passing only some meters from our window (3rd level) - although windows are closed rather loud. After we asked for ihrer rooms, we got. more silent ones - thanks!

We booked club rooms and expected to be near to the lounge, which is in the 7th. Only One of the rooms was, the other on 5th.

Lounge was very disappointing: coffee, tea, water all day Long (only paper cups). However, no snacks (on three days there were cookies, on the other days nuthing but apples) -  no Softdrinks! In the evening some cheese (First days Not more than some slides which obviously was Not enough for all guests). Breakfast ok, Croissants, Jam, yoghurt, fresh Fruit Salad, orange juice.

Looking at the Description in Booking.com and TripAdvisor we are rather disappointed. So, no Real recommendation",3,2018,07,31
219,Highly Recommended!,"A great hotel in Dublin, excellent location, just metres from the train station, lovely lobby area, spacious bar, neat modern rooms, above average breakfast, helpful staff.
Our room was wheelchair accessible with a level access shower, rails at the toilet and a lovely spacious basin area. There was a double bed and a single bed, with some room to move around using my wheelchair.
I stayed one night with my favourite cousin, we went to see Wicked !  Loved it!  We used the Luas to get to the Bord Gais theatre and walked back to the hotel.
We would stay here again and would recommend to others.",5,2018,07,27
219,"Comfortable, modern, pleasant in a surprising location","We stayed at the Address one night on a trip to the Paul Simon concert. It is close to a tram station and has a railway line running along one side of it. Approaching the hotel one has the impression its one of those station bars.  There is a restaurant and also a bar at the entrance.  However, beyond these emerges a modern reception to a very pleasant hotel facility.

The club lounge breakfast is adequate in an interesting space upstairs.  We had dinner in the town where there is choices plenty.

The rooms were comfortable, spacious, clean and well stocked with the usual without clattering the spaces.  The even number rooms on the northern side back onto the railway track but we hardly felt the movement of the trains. The nights were comfortable.

We did have some issues with the digital keys as did other couples that we met.  The keys malfunctioned at odd times which given that you need them for going everywhere can be a nuisance.  We once found ourselves locked in between the lift and the corridor to our rooms. My daughter had to go down six floors to reception.   This needs sorting.

Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay and will certainly be back again.",4,2018,07,25
219,Lovely Stay,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights whilst visiting Dublin. The hotel is in a really good location, just a short walk from Temple Bar and most other sights. We stayed in the most basic room the hotel had to offer but it was really big and we were delightfully surprised. The hotel decor is stunning and it's located near the train station and almost built within the arches. We had an issue with the aircon however, someone came to see us straight away and fixed the issue so they were very attentive. We would consider coming back here. The hotel bar is also really nice and the bar staff are really friendly. Highly recommend.",5,2018,07,24
219,Great hotel for families ,"We stayed at the North Star as part of a bus tour. We were told that it sits at the edge of a sketchy part of town so keep that in mind if walking around. We walked to the EPIC museum from the hotel in the late afternoon and had no issues, it was about a 15 minute walk. The concierge was not super helpful and seemed irritated we didn't know where we were going,  but otherwise we had good service.  The rooms were clean and modern.",5,2018,07,23
219,Great hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Address for a weekend break. The hotel is beautiful, kept spotlessly clean with very attentive staff.

We had food at the hotel restaurant on the first night, the food was very tasty and reasonably priced too. There are also daily food offers that are very good value for money.

Breakfast each morning was very good, with a great variety to choose from.

The location of the hotel is great, an approximate 15 minute stroll to the Temple Bar area of the city, with a variety of different shops, restaurants and bars on the way. There is also a spar mini supermarket located directly next door to the hotel.

We will be returning to the Address on our next trip to Dublin. 

Thank you to all the staff at the Address. 10 out of 10.",5,2018,07,23
219,Nope !,"Attended this hotel on business. Had the courtesy to book via the Hotel‚Äôs own website only to be told I had to pay for everything in advance without even seeing my room before.

My room was not clean and the balcony full of cigarette butts all over the floor. There were stains in my bathtub making me doubt the thoroughness of the cleaning prior to my arrival.
I had a single bed on wheels which could easily travel all across the room while I am sleeping. External bedding had a smell.

The staff was quite unpleasant and really not that helpful. Breakfast was all-right.

I paid this stay out of pocket and it was quite expensive for the level of service provided. I take it Dublin was fully booked during my stay but there are much better places where you can spend your money for a bed in the city.",2,2018,07,22
219,Just a few things to know ,"This hotel was extremely nice inside. The bar and restaurant areas are gorgeous. We stayed in the new section and were extremely pleased. I did want to share some traveler tips for the area:
-the car park is Connelly and is directly across the street down a long narrow road where buses sit. You can cut thru the train station or take the walk under the train bridge to get there. A car is not ideal when staying in downtown Dublin. Public transportation is ideal. 
-the train is directly outside the hotel across the street and you can hear it inside somewhat. 
-there are two hotels here within one, the Address is the new side and North Star is the old side.
-leave the hotel go to the right and then the left, there is a nice long street of pubs and shopping.
-Martin at the concierge desk is the BEST! Let him hook you up with your tours!
-plenty of cabs right across the street in front of Connelly station and across to the right by the (electric train). The hotel can call a cab if you need a card reader, otherwise do Euros.
-Spar next door to the right has an ATM and also opens at 630am for breakfast and such. Seems to be open pretty late at night too. 
-O‚ÄôShea‚Äôs pub to the right and down is great!
-leave the hotel and go a block or two to the right (bus station) to catch the Green hop on and off bus (Martin can also hook you up with tickets). 
-the area looks poor outside the hotel but don‚Äôt let that detour you. Be a safe tourist like any city and keep purses and backpacks close to you. Be smart. 
",4,2018,07,20
219,Best Concierge Ever ;-)!!,"Martin went above and beyond the call of duty to help me with a technical problem I was having.  
Overall service has been great.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.
The hotel is very conveniently located to public transit.",4,2018,07,20
219,Good location,"We travelled to Dublin on the 13th July 2018 and we was booked into the North Star hotel. We arrived early because of flight time the reception staff was very helpful even though they was very busy with the hotel being fully booked they took our cases and placed them in a secure lock up for later on when our room would be ready so we could go and do a bit of exploring while we waited to the check in time. I have no doubt that if the hotel wasn't fully booked being high tourist season and our room was ready they would have booked us in there and then.
The location is excellant 10 minute walk to the Dublin spire (you can't miss this) where you can catch the hop on hop of tourist bus if you have the tickets or you can purchase them there at the tourist office. 15 mins walk to the Temple Bar area, 2 mins walk to a Luas Tram stop if you don't fancy a walk.
The room was lovely all mod cons Kettle with coffee and tea making facitilys, iron + ironing board, Flat screen tv, Bath and shower, Fresh towells and bedding daily. Our room was at the back of the hotel opposite a college with student accommadation we thought this was going to be a bit noisy with the students but it was no problem at all.
The McGettigans cookhouse staff very friendly and the food was very good can get very busy especially if a local event is happening at croke park.
We would definetly be staying here again on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2018,07,17
219,Perfect hotel,"Visited Dublin with a friend and from check in to check out the staff were great. We'd had a long trip so the person who checked us in took us to our room and insisted on carrying our luggage. We stayed in a club twin room which had complimentary snacks and water in the rooms fridge. Complimentary wine and cheese 6.15pm to 7.15pm every day. We didn't get there in time for cheese and biscuits but enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine on the roof top. Room was amazing. Touch buttons for everything, very easy to use. Not sure why some reviews said it was hard to follow.
Only reason I've not given this hotel 5* is because of the area. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone travelling alone as some questionable characters hanging around. ",4,2018,07,16
219,Pleasant Surprise,"The North Star Hotel is located directly opposite Connolly Station.  It is close to the city centre and a very convenient location to wait if too early for the train. The staff are helpful and cheerful but based on my experience the food is disappointing.  My most recent experience was streaky bacon with crushed avocado on sourdough.  The avocado was delicious but the bacon was excessively greasy and the sourdough inedible as it was toasted to rock hard
Come on guys,there is no excuse, it was a really simple dish which  could have been fantastic with a bit of care.
Will I go back..yes. 
",3,2018,07,16
219,Concert Stay,"Stayed here with my 2 sisters on 12th July for an overnight stay. This hotel is a hidden gem, close to the Bus & Train station and within walking distance to Temple Bar & shops. We arrived before lunchtime and was advised our room would be ready soon, so we had a coffee and some treats in the coffee shop which were delicious. The room was lovely & clean, not overly spacious but was fine for the 3 of us and there was enough mirrors and wardrobe space for us. The reception desk and concierge were more than friendly. Would definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2018,07,14
219,Stay away!!!,"Had the rudest encounter with staff and management at in this hotel. A group of friends and I had dinner and drinks and couldn‚Äôt believe how rude the staff were!! Contacted management for an explanation and received no follow up as promised. Plenty of other amazing Hotels in Dublin that will give you ten times the experience than this awful hotel with below average food. 
Highly recommend the Dean, The Alexander or the Westbury over this place. Avoid avoid avoid!!",1,2018,07,14
219,Clean & Comfy,"The location is not 100% ideal, but it is still close enough to the river and central Dublin to be a 20 minute walk to a lot of exciting things in the city. The outside of the building looks a bit iffy, but as soon as you walk in, you see that it's beautiful!

The desk workers and concierge are very helpful, rooms are clean, beds are comfortable and well-maintained. Complimentary luggage storage which helped when we got to the city at 9:00am and our room wasn't ready (which was expected). We also left the city at 20:00 and after checkout they were able to keep our luggage safely stored.

No complimentary breakfast, but we ate at the Parlor restaurant once and it was delicious and well priced. I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2018,07,13
219,An absolute gem in the heart of Dublin,"Just spent one night in this fab hotel after Bruno Mars concert in Marley Park (Magic!!!). It has been fully re-furbed since my last visit, many years ago and wow, what a difference.  Beautifully renovated to an excellent standard and the staff were polite, helpful, courteous and very professional. Centrally located beside Connolly train station and just a few minutes walk from O‚ÄôConnell street. It couldn‚Äôt have been better. I will definitely return. Thank you for a truly warm and welcoming, albeit short stay!!!",5,2018,07,13
219,Pleasantly surprised...,"We booked a self drive tour via Sceptre Tours and this hotel was booked on our behalf.  We are in Ireland to celebrate my hubs 50th birthday and prior to our arrival, I reached out the hotel to have some bubbly in our room upon arrival.  Martin, the Concierge, help me out with that and much more.  Our car rental co was suppose to drop off a car to us at the hotel but were a complete no show.  A few quick calls by Martin had things sorted out and kept the disruption to a minimal.  Can‚Äôt say enough good things about him and his professionalism.  Exceeded our expectations!  Not the fanciest place we have ever stayed but the room was just fine and suited our needs this trip!  Centrally located as City Centre is only a short walk away.  There is no onsite parking bur there is a secured parking lot within walking distance to the hotel. ",4,2018,07,12
219,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here overnight while attending the Michael Buble concert at Croke Park, our room was ready on arrival at 11am, our room was a suite on the 5th Floor right next to the railway line, however you were aware of trains passing but they weren‚Äôt overly noisy and didn‚Äôt disturb out sleep, the room it‚Äôs self is very modern, the only disappointing fact we found was the air con cooled the sitting area down, but the bedroom was extremely warm as the air con didn‚Äôt reach the bedroom, the staff we met were all lovely and very friendly, the hotel is situated round the corner from the bus station, train station, and tram stop, if you get the bus from the airport (747) you only have a 2 min walk from Connely station stop to the hotel, if u are attending a concert or rugby crime park is only 15-20min walk, the shopping area and pubs in temple bar area are also only a 10min walk away, I would definitely recommend this hotel and would be happy to return to it",4,2018,07,11
219,Wonderful hotel,North star hotel is a lovely hotel it is clean and very friendly bedrooms are cleaned daily. I would definitely recommend this hotel it is near to all the facilities but very quiet and relaxing too. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,07,10
219,Great hotel with great restaurant.,It was easy to travel around Dublin's main areas from the hotel. The McGettigans Cookhouse restaurant in the hotel was excellent.  We had to leave a day early and the friendly staff had no problem to refund us. ,5,2018,07,09
219,Great place to stay in Dublin at a good price.,We just spent the weekend in Dublin for the Ghost Festival. From our Hotel it was very easy to get to the centre of Dublin. You can walk or take the tram. Close by check out Malloys for a pint or two.,4,2018,07,09
219,"Modern, comfortable, great location","Nice trendy hotel with great facilities, friendly staff and great food.  Reception area is spacious and set below a railway overpass which adds to the character of the hotel.  Thankfully the rooms are not impacted by the railway!  The only black mark was that the waiting staff preferred if you go to them and order!!",5,2018,07,09
219,Great Stay,"Really enjoyed our stay here last night. Staff were very pleasant and helpful... they stored our bags as we were way too early for check in.  Twin room was very spacious and clean.  Breakfast this morning was very good. A great selection of food (including a pancake machine that I have never seen before): cereal, fruit, toast and hot food.  The only slightly negative thing is that we were on the 7th floor which I believe was the top and there was a constant loud humming overhead which made it difficult to get over to sleep.  If we weren‚Äôt as tired as we were, it would have been a serious problem for us.  I would definitely stay again, but would request not to be placed on the 7th floor.",4,2018,07,08
219,Great stay,"Stayed in June 2018 for a concert in Dublin and was really pleasantly pleased. The room was lovely, loads of space and air conditioned. Everything was electronic and very modern. The bed was amazing and so big! The only down side is your a little walk outside of Temple Bar and the main areas, but not a great distance. Didnt experience food here but all else was clean and really comfortable. Would stay again without a doubt.",5,2018,07,06
219,Thumbs up!,"From the very start, it was a good experience here. The manager was super helpful in providing us with change needed for the parking meter that only accepted coins and whilst we attended to the parking, he organised the luggage and checking in so we were not delayed too long before we got into our room. Despite some reviewers complaining about the noise from the trains, we didn't have any such problem. The room was very modern with touch buttons and sensors for lights and everything worked well. The bed was very comfortable as was the size of the room. It was a pleasant surprise to have access to the club lounge which took care of our breakfast needs. Simple choice of pastries, fruit, cereal and yoghurt, coffee, tea and hot chocolate in a pleasant room with a good view and a rooftop balcony. The restaurant serves delicious food! We were very tempted to not be adventurous and explore the city for restaurants. Location was pretty central and we could walk or catch public transport easily. For the price, this is certainly worthwhile and we will definitely stay here again!",5,2018,07,06
219,Great surprise!,"We booked our flight and hotel through a 3rd party. After booking we learned from dublin forums that this hitel was in a nkt so desirable area. We went ready to be disappointed. Boy were we surprised. We walked all 3 nights we were there at kate hours from temple bar area and O'Connell and we did not feel like we needed to grasp our bags tighter. It is directly across the street from a dart, train and tram station. The lobby was beautiful. Our room was perfect. It was clean and nice. The staff were all helpful. If we ever get to go back to dublin we will definitely look into the north star again!",5,2018,07,05
219,Excellent Location Poor / Nil Management,"Excellent location, just a min walk fm the train station. 5 mins walk to shopping hubs nearby.

Manager Bobby at the Address at Dublin 1 has totally spoiled our stay!! 

Two rooms are assigned into 2/F n 5/F, though we have requested at the time of booking to have nearby / adjacent rooms. Apart from ‚Äúsubject to availability‚Äù, Manager Bobby ‚Äúblamed‚Äù us for booking 4 nights and everybody have already checked in?!! We were there at 3pm whereas check in time is 2pm. Is it a joke that rooms are allocated on first come first served?!! 

Manager Bobby said he can do nothing but he can do everything tomorrow! So we vacated the rooms and ready to move the other day... a trainee told us ‚Äúnothing is in the computer‚Äù and we insisted to meet (confront) with Manager Bobby. At the very beginning he denied his PROMISE and repeated a hundred times that ‚Äúrequests are subject to availability‚Äù.... and ask us to move into another room for one night yet have to vacant the room another day ‚Äúagain‚Äù??!!! What a brilliant suggestion to keep asking guests to move rooms twice for a stay of four nights!! When we showed our discomfort, he started to blame his colleague NOT following his instruction....

When we are ready to leave the hotel and get on a 7/8 seater taxi pre-booked the day before through the hotel, you guess what... we were told again... ‚Äúnothing is in the computer‚Äù!! What a consistent poor service that conclude our stay at the Address at Dublin 1.

219,Recent stay,"Great place. General Manager, David was hard working and helpful to me as a leader of a group of 15 American travelers. The air conditioning was very welcomed as we were visiting during a heat wave! Rooms were comfortable and clean.",5,2018,06,30
219,A very comfortable stay,"Although I have stayed in Dublin many times, this was the first time here.  Arrived at a very attractive reception area with a dedicated check in desk for the Address.  Got checked in and made my way to the room.  Separate lift from the rest of the hotel and got up to my room.  First impressions were very good and the room looked welcoming. The spacious bathroom was well equipped and the bed and pillows extremely comfortable.  Good choice of tea and coffee including Bewleys and Nespresso.  The air con was really excellent and I was able to maintain the perfect temperature to sleep.  Wifi good too.  The slight downside was the continental breakfast in the executive lounge which I felt could have been improved as the selection was rather limited. ",5,2018,06,30
219,Fabulous hotel ,"Had a fantastic stay at this hotel, nothing was to much trouble. Staff were warm and friendly and couldn‚Äôt help you enough. Rooms were very clean and tidy. We also had an evening meal at their restaurant which was absolutely delicious, it was fresh and tasty. Also at a reasonable price.  Thanks to the lady in the Parlour for making all the lattes and drinks for our group of 9 each morning. Definitely would stay here again.",5,2018,06,30
219,Trains rocked our room!,"Stayed 2 nights, liked the proximity to Connolly St and Temple Bar, could walk easily to Epic Museum.  However, Great Value Vacations failed to tell us that there is no parking at hotel, have to park at Connolly Car Park, $9.50euros/day.  Quite a schlep dragging our luggage.  Reception desk not friendly or welcoming, quite brusque.  However, Martin at the concierge was wonderful!  Very gracious and helpful!
Trains shook our room, very annoying.  At least they stopped around midnight until around 5am, room was nice but I found bed to be very hard.",3,2018,06,25
219,Christmas present,We stayed on Saturday night it was a Christmas present we were going to billy Joel never knew the hotel existed we were both delighted with the hotel from the check in right through our room was in the address part of the hotel it was excellent we couldn‚Äôt have had better would highly recommend this hotel especially if you‚Äôre going to a concert great location will definitely be back thank you,5,2018,06,25
219,Friendly staff,"I recently stayed at this hotel for two nights. The hotel itself is very well located, extremely clean and comfortable. However by far it‚Äôs most valuable asset is it‚Äôs wonderful staff. They could not have done enough for us, were extremely helpful friendly and courteous both at reception and at breakfast each morning . Check in and out was very efficient. Looking forward to a return trip.",5,2018,06,23
219,Loud ,"The train stop was right at our back patio. So I was only able to sleep, from 12pm to about 5:45am, cause that was the train schedule. Two out of the four nights I was suppose to wake up that early which was some what convenient. The hotel was really nice and clean and roomy. We got the hop on hop off tickets and didn‚Äôt seem to need them cause everything was about a 20 min walk. The AC wasn‚Äôt as good as it should have been, and sleeping with the patio door open pretty much wasn‚Äôt an option, because it was so loud with either people yelling or the train. ",3,2018,06,23
219,Nice rooms,A nice room. Given complementary entrance to the premier lounge where you can get a free light breakfast. Quite complicated lighting system which means some lights go on which you don‚Äôt want on. Staff seem nice and helpful. Quick to fix a fuse which went in our room. ,4,2018,06,22
219,Excellent Stay,"We stayed in the Northstar Hotel on the 15th June and were greeted by the lovely front of house Manager.  She was absolutely amazing and upgraded us to the Jonathan Swift Suite.  The room was fantastic with a great view, it‚Äôs own little living room area and a separate section for the bedroom. 

The breakfast the following morning was also fantastic.

Could not recommend this hotel more. This is our second time staying here. The welcoming staff, the amazing decor and the proximity to Dublin City Centre is perfect and only a few minutes walk. The Connolly Luas stop is right across from the hotel as well so perfect for getting around.",5,2018,06,21
219,Great location ,"The hotel was lovely. Staff were friendly and helpful and both restaurants were good. The smaller cafe had interesting and healthy items on the menu. Our room was clean, modern and comfortable. I‚Äôd stay again next time we‚Äôre in Dublin. ",5,2018,06,19
219,Excellent place to stay,"I've stayed at the North Star Hotel several times and keep going back but my latest visit was the best yet! Very comfortable bed, quiet room, beautifully decorated bathroom. The refurb has completely changed the ambience and it feels classy but welcoming. The food was good, the choice being a little limited. The staff are friendly and welcoming, whilst being helpful. Can't think of any negatives to be honest - a cracking hotel!",5,2018,06,19
219,Two night stay,We stayed here for two mid week nights in June in a premier King room. We found our room comfortable and had everything we needed. Oddly there was only one mug for the coffee machine and one of the ceiling lights didn't work..... Neither thing bothered us so we simply left these notes on our feed back form. All staff we encountered we friendly and helpful. Would certainly stay here again in the future and would have no problem recommending this hotel.,5,2018,06,19
219,Badly let down,"Bar and restaurant fabulous staff and food. BUT  so let down with hotel facilities. no lifts to bedrooms on second floor, and because of my condition found it very painful staying 3 nights.no one cared. should be highlighted i would have booked different hotel.  and manager unavailable to talk to me.  shame on them...4*hotel !!!!",3,2018,06,19
219,Great hotel,Beautiful - comfortable - great customer service - great bartenders! Would definetly stay again - convenient and fun!!! Took a cab to Temple Square and walked back - easy! We were able to check in early which was great for a much needed nap! ,5,2018,06,18
219,In the heart of Dublin,"Very nicely appointed property, and the staff is very helpful and accommodating. The dining options are quite good, and the hotel is an easy walk to the Temple Bar area and all of the attractions nearby. ",5,2018,06,18
219,"Morden, fency, clean, hotel in central Dublin","My husband and I came to Dublin for watching Michael McIntyre show on 9th Jun. The hotel is located central Dublin with walking distance to all the tourist points. The hotel divided to two parts. The old part for restaurant and lobby. The new part is for guests rooms which finished last year. In the room, everything are controlled by touchscreen. Very fency, very clean, very quiet and with good size. Very friendly staffs. We had very good time while our staying in the hotel. Definitely would recommend it if anyone want to visit Dublin.",5,2018,06,18
219,Beautiful property and GREAT service,We stayed 2 nights and had access to the rooftop--rooms were immaculate and great technology!  We had a issue with our AC but the staff quickly addressed it and was very kind to us in the process.  Would highly recommend!,5,2018,06,18
219,Great hotel,Lovely hotel and very central to shops and restaurants. Rooms of good standard and breakfast very good will return when back in Dublin 3 rd time there and upgraded this hotel since our last visit and looks great,5,2018,06,18
219,Choose breakfast ,"Choose breakfast, choose an Irish breakfast, choose toast, butter and strawberry jam.
Choose bacon, beans, mushrooms and eggs. Choose a flaming big sausage.
Choose breakfast at The Address At Dublin No 1.",5,2018,06,17
219,Lovely room,"We stayed here one night on our way home after previously staying in Dublin at the front end of our trip. Since we had been in Dublin previously, we were not so concerned about location. If you are staying in Dublin for the first time, I could see that this location is not the best for all of the interesting things to see and do. (Although we love to walk and it really isn‚Äôt that far!). The room was spacious and modern. Comfortable beds which are nice. Everything is electronic, so it takes a bit to figure them out. I would have preferred regular switches. The bathroom has wonderful hot water so the showers are great. Upon checking the front clerk was not very friendly and seemed like we were putting her out. The good news is that once we checked in, we did not have to deal with her again. They offered a nice continental breakfast in the executive lounge, which was the perfect amount of food and drink to get going in the morning. 
I have to admit, after I booked the room and read some of the reviews I thought I should change hotels. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt as it was a very nice and peaceful evening and I did not have the same complaints as some other reviewers. ",4,2018,06,17
219,Spacious and comfortable ,"Stayed in this hotel for one night due to attending a concert at the 3 arena. Very convenient location, we were able to walk there and back. Luas line close by so we had a choice to take transport if we wished. Had our dinner in the resturant McgGettigans. Which was very good service. Gluten free options available here which was much appreciated. Plus helpful and knowledgeable staff. 
Room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. Member of staff accompanied us to the room to explain the tech side of things (Wi-Fi password, light panel, curtains, etc). The hotel is located next to rail line, we were aware of this prior to booking. We found no issue, I guess if your a light sleeper if may bother you but we had no issue. 
On the 7th floor the Lounge area has drinks and light refreshments. Unfortunately we were a little late visiting in the morning so no pastries were available. Might suggest that this be restocked more regularly. Outside of this point, a very enjoyable stay. Would recommend it to others. ",4,2018,06,16
219,1 night stay ,"My partner and I had a fantastic night stay here on the 15th June 2018. On arrival we were upgraded and complimented with a free drink for booking directly through hotel. We were also treated to complimentary breakfast bites and evening nibbles in the Club lounge . The hotel is fabulous , 10/10 for cleanliness and comfort . Additionally , the staff were very accommodating and helpful . We got room service which was a treat . All-round I would highly recommend this hotel as it is fantastic and a 2 minute walk from Connolly station. ",5,2018,06,16
219,Great hotel & location,"Had a lovely 2 night stay at North Star Hotel. Very friendly welcome from reception staff & delighted with our very spacious room on the 6th floor with fresh water, coffee machine, fridge & air conditioning. Beds lovely & comfortable ensuring a good nights sleep. Delicious buffet breakfast with great variety of cereals, breads, cooked breakfast, pancakes, pastries fruit & cheeses. Staff all very friendly & helpful. It was my daughters birthday & delivered to the room was a lovely card & chocolates which was a really nice gesture & she was delighted. The hotel is really handy to the train station & to O‚ÄôConnell Street & main shopping area (only a 5-10 minute walk) I highly recommend a stay here and will definitely be back",5,2018,06,13
219,Renovated and convenient location,"Very chic feel, within 5 minute walk to bus/train station and comfortable large rooms. Good blackout curtains which is important when daylight begins around 4am! our room faced the courtyard and was very quiet. The automated lights were a bit difficult to master- I would have preferred switches. Great find for our one night stay in Dublin.",5,2018,06,13
219,Horrible Hotel - beware!,"On a family vacation 1st stay rooms not ready & staff not kind.2nd stay staff RUDE & room with no air in 1st, no air & rotted floor in 2nd FINALLY 3rd room ok. Treated like a dumb little lady by mgmt.",1,2018,06,13
219,"Good value, good location","We spent two nights in the North Star Hotel enroute Toronto to Portugal (there are direct flights Dublin to the Algarve).  The purpose of the stay was to recover the jet lag and see a bit of the city.

We booked club floor which included breakfast and a ""happy hour"".  Both are served on the top floor with access to a lovely rooftop patio.  Breakfast was basic continental but was enough for us.

The rooms are very nice with VERY comfortable beds, linen and towels.  The room is very high tech as previously mentioned.  Black out blinds were appreciated when we needed to have a nap to recover from the overnight flight.

All the staff were exceptional.  We didn't have any issues with our booking or with our rooms so there was little interaction.

Although we didn't use it, there is a lovely restaurant/pub adjacent to the hotel lobby.

To get to and from the airport we used the 747 bus which was convenient and much cheaper than a taxi.",4,2018,06,12
219,Overall good,"I have mostly positive things to say about this hotel. First of all, the service was great, location good and the facilities amazing. The breakfast buffet was really great. 
The room was fine although not the biggest. It had a large tv screen with lots of choices and a comfy bed. 
One of the things I didn't like was that housekeeping came into our room even though we had the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door. This happened twice. It wasn't a big issue and we just said that they could come back later, but it would be nice if they respected the sign. 
The restaurant is really worth a try.
Overall a good value that you won't regret booking. ",4,2018,06,12
219,Our trip to Ireland,"As a travel agent, you want to see the places which you sell to your clients.  This was our first trip to Ireland.  We stayed at the North Star our first night and our last night in Ireland.  This is a very nice hotel, the staff were awesome and the breakfast they served was delicious.  It is about a 10 minute walk to the city center and all the amazing sites on your list to visit.  On our first day there my husband was not feeling good and needed to go to the ER.  Julia, at the front desk, had gotten us a cab and we were on our way.  When we got the the hospital, we were turned away because they said they had met their quota of patients and were getting ready to close, at 6:00 pm.  We got back to the hotel and Julia went above and beyond to help my husband and called us a doctor who came to our hotel room, checked him out and was able to give my husband a script for the antibiotics he needed.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to my clients.  Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2018,06,11
219,A shaky start ...! ,"We stayed in the North Star hotel for one night while attending a concert at the nearby 3Arena. We had booked online some months previously, an offer which included a continental breakfast. However upon checking in we were informed, somewhat abruptly, that this would not be honoured as the terms and conditions of our online booking/ offer had changed - despite us showing the receptionist our booking confirmation which clearly stated that breakfast was included.  She simply stated that this had happened before. Upon arriving at our room which was at street level with bars outside the window and rubbish lying outside we asked to speak with the hotel manager.  We spoke with Ela who upon rechecking our reservation confirmed that a continental breakfast was indeed included, and upgraded this immediately to a cooked breakfast and our room to a club room on the 6th floor - she was attentive, friendly and could not have done any more to make us feel welcome or address our concerns.  She is a credit to the hotel! Our room was lovely, spacious and clean and the bed really comfortable. Breakfast was excellent with great variety - although the tables were placed really close together and you had to literally squeeze between them to get in and out.  However, after a rather shaky start we really enjoyed our stay!  Thank you Ela for addressing our concerns so promptly and professionally!",4,2018,06,10
219,Great weekend,"The hotel is situated around a 10 minute walk to the busy temple bar area. There is a very nice pub with good food just around the corner called the celt. Hotel is nice and the staff were generally good. Down side was the housekeeping as they dont change the bedding even if dirty. They just hid a dirty mark on the underside if the duvet cover. This is not 4 star service. Breakfast is advertised as pre book at 13.5 euro but if you try and book for the following day you are charged 15. What timeframe is pre booking i ask....however, breakfast has a good variety",3,2018,06,10
219,Family Get Together,"We had 2 rooms for one night. We drank in the bar & ate in the restaurant.
The team throughout were superb- absolutely nothing was too much trouble. We felt so comfortable & well looked after the whole time.
Rooms were lovely- clean & comfortable.
Food was really good - we had the 2 course set menu.
Thank you all for a wonderful stay.",5,2018,06,09
219,"Bedrooms excellent, but dining area leaves a lot to be desired","My husband and I stayed there for 4 nights.
It is not situated in a busy commercial area.
It is  adjacent to a  train station.

However, a 20 +minute walk takes one into O Connell street, almost opposite the GPO.
We were prepared for this. We were back at the hotel each evening by about 8pm, in the daylight. I would not have liked to walk back in the darkness, as the vicinity does not make one feel comfortable.

The bedroom which is located in the new part of the building is excellent. We opted for a quieter room interior room which had a very limited view so as to minimise the noise of the passing trains. All we heard as a faint  occasional rumble. 
The room is very spacious, has a very large bed, a large flat screen TV, coffee machine ( be sure to get instructions to use!!), built in safe, etc.
The bathroom is also large, with strong shower, and bath.
All lighting, a/c etc is operated by by touch buttons, even the opening/ closing of curtains. Make sure to have the room card at all times as opening  the bedroom door, fire doors and using the elevator is operated via swiping the card.

The negative side I found, is that the dining area at night time is also part of the only bar.
This makes dining very noisy and conversation almost impossible, and also the may be music added.
The menu is quite limited, especially if one is vegetarian and / or has a small appetite.

All the staff members we encountered are very helpful and friendly.",4,2018,06,08
219,Beautiful hotel,"The hotel was stunning! Curtains open and close with a button, room is stunning and bathroom! Hotel was Stunning, can't wait to go back! Staff very friendly, taxi rank outside! 28‚Ç¨ from airport, surrounded by loads of bars and restraunt, very central",5,2018,06,07
219,A week in Dublin,"We stayed at the Address Dublin 1 for a week during our visit to Dublin. Although the room was comfortable and equipped with latest technology for hotel rooms,  we were not impressed with the location of the hotel and its surroundings; also the service was not impressive and a lot to be desired.",3,2018,05,31
219,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, bars, rooms food,  location all good. A big thumbs up all round. Close to the station and  easywalking  distance to all attractions .Local bars cafes and restaurants also good. O would highly recommend this hotel .

",4,2018,05,31
219,Great city center hotel - but NO parking!,"We loved staying at the North Star Hotel on our last night in Ireland.  It's very chic and the rooms have AIR CONDITIONING!!!  Everything was clean and the staff was wonderful.  The big con to this place is that there's no parking and the nearest lot is a healthy walk away.  If we were coming in without a car again, I'd definitely stay, but the lack of parking is a definite deterrent.",4,2018,05,30
219,Wonderful Stay,"Excellent hotel. Ideally located near all transportation options, buses, trains, walking throughout Dublin and traveling Ireland. The staff from the front desk reception to restaurant and all other hotel employees were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Rooms were beautiful and comfortable!",5,2018,05,30
219,Good modern hotel,"Modern hotel with good breakfast. Employees were lovely. The only thing which I didn't like it was the small two bedroom, there was not enough space for 2 people. And train was passing almost on every 5 minutes. But in total I'm very satisfied from this hotel.",4,2018,05,30
219,Lovely hotel,"We stopped for three nights and had no problems. The room was clean, staff were friendly and the public areas were good. It took about 10 minutes to walk into the town centre and 15 minutes to reach Temple Bar. The only reason it isn‚Äôt 5 stars is that the area is a bit ‚Äòrough‚Äô, and not great to walk through late at night.",4,2018,05,29
219,Great Hotel,"We stayed here on our last 2 night in Ireland. The rooms were ultra modern and everything could be set up at a touch of a button. The bed was super comfortable and the room was super quiet. The hotel is conveniently located close to Dart station, Train Station and Bus terminal and is walking distance to many sights.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,05,28
219,Stylish hotel a short walk from the city centre,"We decided to take a taxi from the airport to the hotel. The process was simple and it was great to get some good old Irish banter and stories from the taxi driver. After a number of stories and some quick tips from the taxi driver, one of which indicated the hotels location was a little rough around the edges with drug use nearby (we come from London so this didn't phase us and also we didn't encounter any such activities during our stay). The journey from the airport was around 20 minutes and cost us 28 Euro (on comparing with the other members of our party who arrived before us this was about standard). I see other people have travelled by bus to the hotel and i imagine this is a lot cheaper.

The hotel is also called 'the address', on arrival we were pleasantly surprised with the look and style of the hotel, the reception looks nice indeed. We did hear the rumble of the nearby trains while  in reception, but this was the only time. The staff all very friendly and helpful on check in. There are a number of facilities restaurants, spa, gym and a 7 the floor premier lounge, however we didn't eat at the hotel, so cant comment on this area. I did try the gym, that was basic, but acceptable and free for guests (just ask for the key at reception).

The room was a good size, well appointed with aircon, safe, dressing gowns, all mod cons really. The bed was very large and very comfortable. During our nights stay here we did have a leak appear from the ceiling of our room, the staff dealt with it very well, even in the early hours of the morning, they got us another room for the rest of the night and by morning our room was accessible and good as new. Slightly annoying from our perspective and would have been a nice gesture to get a meal voucher or something for the inconvenience caused. The other couple we were visiting with mentioned their room had poor water pressure, but ours was fine. 

Location was great, a short walk from Dublin centre and has lots of coffees hops, restaurants and convenience stores for supplies locally. 

Overall one of our favourite hotels we stayed in during our trip to Ireland.",4,2018,05,28
219,Don't do it!,"I 've never posted a negative review online, ever, but if it will help someone else, than here it goes. Worst hotel experience I've ever had. No parking!  We drove around for an hour to no avail and ended up ditching the rental car at the airport two days early and cabbing it back to the hotel. The AC was broken in our room, which we reported, and when we came back from dinner, we called again and maintenance delivered a fan to the room. We had to switch rooms the following day after reporting the issue for a third time.  We ran out of toilet paper and called down for more, which was never delivered. The location of the hotel is literally right next to the train station. The train goes by your window so closely, you could reach out and touch it. Very sketchy area. Lot of graffiti, etc. Definitely not a place for families. Avoid at all costs.",1,2018,05,28
219,Very disappointed ,We were very disappointed in this hotel. We came as a group some were put in very very old rooms that they couldn‚Äôt even open two suitcases to lay flat the room was so small. Some rooms the air-conditioning didn‚Äôt work and the temperature was close to 80 in them. Some are renovated with open showers (no walls) and the sprayer didn‚Äôt fit properly so it sprayed all over getting the towels wet and all the floor so when going to use the toilet it made it very slippery. No I would never recommend!,2,2018,05,26
219,modern stylish,"spent an overnight here for an event in the 3 arena. convenient location though you need to he security conscious late at night. sensored bed lights were annoying.  good breakfast and choice of eateries. mcgettigans fine for dinner- portions on small size. rooftop area should be available to all, in my view. foyer and decor pleasing aesthetically. ",4,2018,05,24
219,Every time we visit Dublin we stay at North Star.,"This is very good hotel, with friendly staff and easy access to all Dublins areas! Train station just opposit, bus station just around the corner. Luas / tram line just beside train station. You can get anywhere from this hotel with no porblems! City center Just 15mins walk by!
Thank you for making each of our stays with you wonderful experience!",5,2018,05,23
219,Superb facilities and friendly staff,"We booked this hotel last minute and was so pleased with our choice. The staff on reception are so helpful, friendly and welcoming. We flew into Dublin and caught the Dublin Airbus 700 (‚Ç¨6 for one way and ‚Ç¨13 return) that drops you off on O‚ÄôConnel street outside The Gresham hotel and then it‚Äôs about a 8-10 minute walk to North Star hotel. Airbus runs every 20 minutes and is easy to find if you follow the signs for the buses on the way out of Dublin airport. The breakfast choice was superb and they even had a pancake making machine! You can pre-book breakfast the night before for ‚Ç¨13.50, otherwise it‚Äôs ‚Ç¨16 per person. Rooms were clean and the bed was soooooo comfy. My only criticism would be the lack of kettle and milk in the room for tea! They have a coffee making machine but it was tricky making a cup of tea with that and we didn‚Äôt have time to ask about it at reception. The Cookhouse is also lovely - the restaurant attached to the hotel. We had the pizza and cookhouse chips and called to order via the hotel reception as our flight was running late! Last orders for food is 2145. The hotel is a short walking distance from the city centre near to the trinity college side of Dublin. We only stayed here a couple of nights as it was a flying visit but would definitely stay for longer if we go again. ",4,2018,05,23
219,Not a bad word to say üòÅüëåüèª,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel in a premier king room, nice and spacious, clean, loverly comfortable bed big enough for us both to starfish and at a great location. Yes a little dated but hey we didn‚Äôt pay megabucks! For what we paid we were very happy with the room and level of service we recieved. 

Unfortunately haven‚Äôt got photos to show you as we were busy exploring the city! We were able to get the bus from the airport and the train station is directly opposit. Well within walking distance to local tourist spots and hop on/off bus tours. Temple bar was about 15 minute walk away. 

Shout out to Anna on reception for securing us an early check in after a ridiculous early morning flight, you saved us being tired and grumpy at the Ed Sheeran concert üòÅüëç. ",5,2018,05,22
219,Hotel,"I‚Äôm sorry I could only give this hotel 3 stars but our room was by a footpath but more importantly the beer garden and part of the hotel are inaccessible. The room was lovely, location excellent. The hotel also has a nice restaurant and is opposite Connolly Station. ",3,2018,05,22
219,Great Concierge,"Last day of the tour. Only needed two more items to make it great. I asked Martin the concierge where I could get old Irish coins-not Euros. After some thinking, researching and talking with the concierge he works with, they found one definite and a maybe place where they could be found. We went to them and found the coins. Thank you Martin!!",5,2018,05,21
219,Dublin ,"I recently stayed at the North Star. I found the hotel to be centrally located to all locations and across from main train station. Everything was within walking distance. You 

The Polish Staff at the front desk  was amazing. They went out of their way to provide amazing service. There was the Manager and her two assistants (woman and man. ) 
I have rarely stayed where the staff left such a positive experience. Kudos to the owners of hotel to pick superior employees.

Rooms in Dublin can be pricey. My room was spotless, breakfast amazing and staff friendly and helpful. What else do you need on vacation. ",5,2018,05,21
219,Convenient Location,"I appreciated the location of this hotel, and enjoyed walking the busy Henry Street to fun shopping centers. It was a bit further to tourist destinations like Trinity College and St. Stephen‚Äôs Green, but doable. 

I found the staff to have exceptional customer service and thoroughly enjoyed my meal in the hotel restaurant. 

Consider asking for a room on a higher level. I was placed on the 1st floor, and had the same air conditioning struggles as other reviewers. I was not comfortable leaving my window open to sleep, which would have easily solved the problem, because my window opened to the courtyard. Plan to pack earplugs as you can hear everything from the hallways, including doors slamming and conversations at a normal volume.",3,2018,05,20
219,Good location,"We stayed recently at this hotel.  The location is very convenient to most things.  The room we were given was in need of repair and makeover.  Floor was noisy, tiles coming off the bathroom floor door handles falling off and difficult to stop the shower from constant dripping.  Room was very close to the railway line and lifts very slow.  On the good side the bed was comfortable and the shower water hot.  Breakfast was pleasant pity it was served in the darkness below street level instead of showcasing what great space they had inside.  Probably look for something else next time we visit.",3,2018,05,20
219,Techno misery ,"Wow, beautiful hotel, great location, and technology to the max. Which is great as long as it works. Our very hot room stayed hot and we kept fiddling with the controls thinking we did something wrong! By the time the maintenance man had diagnosed and offered another room it was almost time to go. I would stay there again but I would be sure everything worked upon checking in. No they didn‚Äôt comp us anything but stamps. ",3,2018,05,20
219,Strategic location,"I've been in Dublin for St Patricks day. The hotel is in a strategic location. Very near to Temple Bar. Outside is anonymus but inside is charming. Staff is very polite and professional. The rooms are ok and the price is fair. The only cons is that you have to prepay at the chceck-in (breakfast too), it's unpleasant. The restaurant inside ""McGettigans"" is very good, I've  had a  good burgher and a tasty beer.",4,2018,05,20
219,Beautiful hotel ,"Hotel is beautiful, staff are so friendly and willing to help with anything. Breakfast is great value for money. Bar and restaurant staff very efficient. The rooms are a good size and very clean. This is my second time staying, first time staying in premier in February, wouldn‚Äôt pay the extra again as that standard rooms are just as good just don‚Äôt get the terrace entry which didn‚Äôt annoy us. Will definitely be booking hotel. Love this place. ",5,2018,05,19
219,Miss Beckett,"Went here for a weekend to celebrate a friends 30th birthday.
Hotel clean staff friendly and helpful, no complaints here.
Food was nice on site.
The tourists location is ideal and there is plenty to do for all ages and expectations.
Dublin itself is expensive but with wise budgeting goes a long way.
Would visit again if returning to Dublin.",5,2018,05,18
219,Weekend trip,Excellent value for money. Rooms are modern and spacious (ideal when there is 4 adults in one room) location is great only about 20 minute walk to temple bar etc. Staff are very friendly would definitely stay again and highly recommend!,5,2018,05,13
219,One night get away to see WWE LIVE,"I stayed here for one night with my sister, son and nephew.. I was very happy with hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and polite..We had a family room which was a good size maybe a bit cramped if you had smaller children but our were 10 and 13 so it was fine it was a lovely room very clean..There are three places to eat in hotel we ate in the cookhouse bar the food was fab but the kids portion side was on the small side we asked for grilled chicken burger excepting a full size burger but what they got was a slider size burger tiny. But apart from that it was fine..We had breakfast in the cellar restaurant in the morning it was fab couldn't fault it plenty of hot food and cereal and drinks..i would definitely come back to hotel again..",5,2018,05,13
219,"Well located, attentive & independent hotel","I spent a short week at the North Star with business at the Dance Ireland studios around the corner.

The hotel is conveniently located directly opposite Connolly train station and is recently renovated. The innovative interior decor is on display from the moment you arrive. Reception is located beneath the beautiful brick arch that is part of the external infrastructure. The restaurant, parlour tea room, cocktail bars and outside garden all lead off from here. A short walk takes you to the lifts that transport you upwards into the daylight.

The hotel has a superior sister - The Address - which is connected by glass bridges. The truly impressive sister accommodation backs directly onto the mechanical landscape of Connolly Station - protected by quad glazing and insulation.

I stayed on the top (7th) floor of the North Star in one of their Premier rooms. My balcony looked over the Address and across the rooftops and station terminus. Facing south east it was beautifully sunny in the mornings.

Premier rooms have a fridge, coffee machine, safe, dressing gowns and slippers. WiFi is free throughout. They also have access to a club lounge on the same floor with stunning views across the city. The lounge has complimentary hot and cold drinks, newspapers, comfy seating and continental breakfast each morning.  I much preferred the peace of this room to the rather busy basement breakfast room.

Breakfast is located in the cellars of the building. Alongside a gym and sauna. The atmosphere is bustling and a tiny bit confused. It‚Äôs a help yourself to a hot / cold buffet and staff serve you hot drinks at your table. If you prepay, it costs 13.5 eu.
I found it rather chaotic and rather low in supplies. I managed to secure the last croissant - but this was stale. Sadly the coffee was really not nice - bitter, thick and had clearly been on the hot plate for hours. I enjoyed the tranquility of the club lounge for breakfast thereafter.

The hotel has a restaurant open for dinner that is mainly a grill. I had an excellent steak and as a lone diner was looked after very well. If you eat by 7 pm you can take advantage of their offer which brings two courses for c EU 23. There is also a comprehensive room service menu available - quickly served.

The hotel is part of an independent family run group. And this really shows. The service was excellent throughout and the surroundings were quirky and stylish. The local area is fairly colourful and has its issues - but the North Star provides a haven from this. External doors are  locked after hours and you need room keys to pass through the building into the lift area.

I could hear the trains coming and going from my side of the building - but only until 11.30 pm. And the glazing is good enough. But if you are a very light sleeper I would suggest a ground floor room ( protected by the courtyard) or a room facing Foley street on the opposite side.

There are three rooms for conference/ business meetings in the building. The nicest of which is a ‚Äò glass box ‚Äò next to reception.

The only real drawback I experienced was the lift system. If you are on the 7 than floor it can take a while to get to breakfast in the basement. Room servicing use the two lifts at this time of day and their linen trollies fill the space. The lifts take a while to reach you and to get where you are going! So if you are in a hurry use the stairs!

I had a lovely visit to the North Star and can recommend it for business use. 
",4,2018,05,13
219,Family Vacation,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel May 9th for one night. It was booked through Aer Linus package. The hotel in itself was okay. I really have an issue with Aer Lingus more then the hotel. First of all the package included a rental car; however, there is nowhere to park at the hotel. The closest place is the train station that is several blocks away. Not a pleasant walk either when you have luggage, it's raining. Glad we got there before dark because parking was not in the best looking area. 

Also, paid extra for premiere room only to have view of back of rail station and got to hear trans until late at night. The only coffee available in rom was decaf. 

Other than these issues, the room was a good size, but not worth the extra money. The McGettigans Cookhouse was excellent and very friendly staff. ",3,2018,05,11
219,"Nice room, good location, close to bus station","I got the Oscar Wilde Suite.
It's a very hot room at summer, specially when coming back from activities and the sun is out. The room is pleasent planned and bed is big. You also got a a small balcony to use. Two LCD tvs. The breakfast is standard, beans, eggs, sandwiches, sausages, cereal and so on.
It takes 10 min to walk to ""the spire"" (the Main Street). 20 min walk to Temple bar.
Station for Bus Airlink is very close and take you to the Airport and back in about 25 min.",4,2018,05,07
219,The Adress room are really good,"Stayed two nights in the Adress room. Super new rooms, good size, everything you need. Perfect. 
Check in took too long, too few people on duty when 10 people arrived at the same time.
Breakfast was great.
Would love to come back.",4,2018,05,06
219,Family Break,"Decided to take a short break to Dublin with my wife and daughter and came across this hotel on one of the internet sites and booked it with a flight package.The hotel was not disappointing and the only minor hiccup we suffered was sorted by the management,even on departure the manager came out to reiterate the hotels apologies.The rooms were very good the restaurant exceptional and bar area inviting.The hotel is opposite the train station but did not cause us problems with the noise which could be a problem for the rooms on the front of the hotel, Also the hotel is well place for visiting the numerous bars, restaurants etc very near by. Would stay there again when next in Dublin",5,2018,05,06
219,Bad location and unbelivably loud,"Booked this hotel as it seemed an affordable option, however upon arriving we found it to be far from the centre, and the surroundings didn't seem particularly safe.
The first red flag was check in, as the hotel is next to Connelly station, as a train went past it was so loud in the reception I could not hear a word the lady at the front desk was saying to me.
They had upgraded us kindly, and the room was large enough, however outside the balcony had a broken tile and plant pots between the rooms, which would be easy enough to move ? Another red flag.
However during the night, we found the room to be incredibly warm, with no way of reducing the temperature. We could hear all the noise from the corridor, everytime someone walked due to the squeaky floorboards, and all the train noises.
After an awful night's sleep, we complained to the front desk, who moved across to The Address, where thankfully the noise was marginally reduced.
I would avoid this hotel at all costs, its in a poor location and the noise is unbearable, the last thing you need whilst enjoying a city break.",2,2018,05,03
219,Nice hotel but terrible location,"We were upgraded to The Address, after an awful night's stay at The North Star.
Strangely enough, The Address hotel and The North Star hotel, exist in parallel within the same building. 
The room we were upgraded too was very high tech, with there being a touch panel to control the curtains, lights etc
The bed was comfy and the room was very spacious with a large bathroom.
I enjoyed the stay but felt I could hear the trains running every time I was in the room. The hotel is next to Connelly station, which is a bad location for a hotel as the trains run near enough every few minutes throughout the day and late into the night.
We had access to the Lounge, where there was fresh pastries and juice every morning, along with cheese and wine late in the afternoon, which was a lovely touch.
We had one terrible experience where I was drying my hair in the mirror and a workman walked into the room, there was no knock either, and luckily I was dressed otherwise it would have been awful ! I felt it was a massive invasion of privacy and after that I bolted the door everytime I entered.
I would recommend staying closer to the centre of Dublin, as this location was not close to anything.",4,2018,05,03
219,"Nice hotel - not central, but pretty close","Stayed here with two kids (8 and 10) in a family room during a family holiday in Ireland. The hotel is very lovely and the rooms all appear to be recently refurbished. The room itself was fine, although pretty cramped for four of us, but that‚Äôs pretty standard. Our view was over an alley way into another building, so nothing to write about. The staff at the hotel were very attentive and helpful, answering all of our questions about how to get about and organising some of our transport.
The location is about a 15 minute walk from Temple Bar, just north of Customs House and over the road from the train and bus stations. It‚Äôs not central, but it was an easy enough walk for the kids each day.",4,2018,05,02
219,"Good hotel, but location a little far from main area.","Location - the area was busy, hotel was too far to walk from main area, city centre, Grafton Street.
Hotel - was really nice.
Room - was really nice and clean.
Bed - was quite good.
Air conditioning - was really good.
Bathroom - was great.
Floor creaked really badly and floor tiles were loose in bathroom and they constantly moved when stepping on them. Not sure why so much. 
Breakfast was included - was nice enough.
Service - great.
Wifi - great.
Room service - not great. I travel quite a bit, and it really annoys me when staff are just lazy. Iron was not put away, shower caps not left the second day, pillow cases dirty, sheets not changed, face towels not left, not enough coffee was left. Clients should not have to ask for these amenities.",4,2018,05,02
219,Terrible experience ,"Was delayed for my train so I decided I would try the lunch in the North Star, it has been a year since my last experience which wasn‚Äôt great, but I thought it should have improved I. My god ,not only had it not improved , it has gotten worse. Despite putting behind me my previous experience ,I was impressed with the menu and the ‚ÄúSPECIALS OF THE DAY‚Äù,
Breast of Duck, which you don‚Äôt see in many established restaurants as a special,not during lunch time rush. Waited 50 mins.before waitress came to me to tell me that the vegetable to be served with the duck had changed. I said I didn‚Äôt mind so long as I wouldn‚Äôt have to wait much longer. 10 mins later THE DUCK arrived. Cold plate with breast of under cooked duck on a bed of cold greens with a few splashes of sauce and 1 large piping hot potato gratin. When I got the waitress attention she apologized and offered me something else if I wanted. When I asked if I could get something that wouldn‚Äôt take to long I was informed it would be 20 mins , and could I not see that thy were busy. I am not blind,I was a customer. ‚Ç¨6 for large coke seems expensive !!!!
If this is what NORTH STAR think of single customer business then it has a long way to go to get my custom back as for the DUCK, they should keep it of the lunch specials. Don‚Äôt worry I definitely won‚Äôt be back, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone .",1,2018,04,30
219,"Good accomodation, location could be better","I was in a Club room. A bit expensive, but the rooms are very comfortable, with automation to control the lights, curtains, air conditioning. Quite nice, when you wake up during the night and that a gentle light switches itself up, around the bed and in the bathroom :)
The location is not the best if you come to visit the town. It's across a rail station, and the neighborhood is not very fancy. 15 to 30 minutes walk to Temple bar and the center (depending on your pace).",4,2018,04,30
219,Does everything you need it to - recommended highly,"We had a family room for four girls and it was great. It was very modern, extremely clean and large enough for us all to get ready, have showers etc. The hotel was quiet enough that we all slept well and if we had stayed for longer we would have tried the beautiful and modern restaurants. The concierge was lovely and helpful and we bought our 'hop-on' bus tickets from him and took his recommendation for breakfast. Very polite staff who were very professional in the face of drunk/rude hotel guests. The only downside is that some of the lights in the room are on sensors, so even when we turned over in the night, the under-cupboard lights would come on! (Only two small lights - not enough to wake us up though).",4,2018,04,30
219,Not very good value for money,"Myself and my mum travelled to Dublin and stayed in the North Star on Wednesday 25th April. My brother was staying in another hotel in Dublin and he wanted to meet up with us. He booked the North Star  with 2 twin club rooms @ 300 euro each, the only rooms left apparently. The room was quite nice and comfortable even thought there were trains running outside it all the time. There was a complimentary minibar in the room and when looked in it, there was one packet of crisps and one small packet of biscuits, not even a bottle of water, I couldn't believe it. I know in other hotels if there is some bottles of drink in it, you may have to pay for them, but we didn't even get that option. I thought minibar meant drinks would be provided albeit soft drinks or alcoholic. I think it looked very bad for such a nice hotel and decorative surroundings that the minibar  looked very inadequate. We ate downstairs in the restaurant and were served by two lovely and friendly girls Sarah and Deidre, which made our night enjoyable.",3,2018,04,27
219,"Clean, comfortable, modern, close to everything with all the amenities","The North Star is directly across from Connolly train station, close to the tram line and a short walk to the hop on hop off bus. It's modern and clean with McGettigans Cookhouse and Bar just off the lobby. An excellent place to eat with wonderful food and service. Two things that were minor annoyances were: The room controls, using the TV control, seemed to have a mind of their own and had to be fixed several times during our visit. Also, the front desk staff didn't quite have their act together and seemed unsure of how to deal with simple issues or questions. Once explained though, they quickly resolved things.",4,2018,04,25
219,Very helpful staff in nice hotel,"My wife and I visited dublin on 18th of April and stayed in the north star  hotel.when we got there I opted to upgrade to a club room because I wanted a quiet room because I am a light sleeper. We were given room 668 on the 6th floor ,whilst walking down the corridor to the room every floor board creaked the noise was terrible , you couldn't walk quietly not to wake other guests when going to the room.
When I opened the door to the room we were met by a sickening smell of sweaty feet an the heat was like an oven . I tried to put the air con on but it didn't work at all we went down to the reception later on and asked them to try to sort it out and they said they would get maintenance to have a look at it.when we got back later on nothing had been done and the room was even hotter and smellier,we rang down to reception and they sent up a fan and said we could change rooms the next day when one became available . The next afternoon we were given  a room on the 7th floor , what a difference, the room was fresh and clean smelling ,the air con worked although we still needed a fan because it wasn't blowing that cold ,( which was also sent up by reception) 
After the room was sorted for us we could settle down to enjoying dublin. The hotel is well located close to the bus station and the tram stop and just around the corner from the 747 airport shuttle . It was about 15 min from temple bar and shopping centre of town . I recommend you get on a hop on hop off bus tour the drivers are hysterically funny and nobody wanted to get off the bus .
The hotel is in what looked like a rougher part of the city but once you are inside you feel like you are in a pretty upmarket place. The hotel has a small gym and separate saunas for male and female located in the changing rooms . 
All in all , after the initial upset with the first room we had a very enjoyable stay and the reception staff could not have done more to make our stay more comfortable ,talking about comfortable the beds are superb .
Would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to Dublin (but don't have room 668)

219,NO PARKING anywhere close!!!,The Hotel was nice but if you are driving to this hotel STAY AWAY!!! We were staying here on our last night in Ireland and if it would have been the first day I would never go back to Ireland. There is no parking anywhere close to this hotel. And when we found parking the people at the parking lot told us to cut thru a train station to get to our hotel. We asked if we could just walk down the street we drove down and they said it wasn't safe. They said it was gang filled and junkies were everywhere. Not a great way to start out to the hotel. The clerk that checked us in could absolutely care less of our troubles. The rooms were nice and very automated and the restaurant was good as well. Sorry to do this but the experience was just terrible. ,1,2018,04,24
219,"Nice, Clean, Noisy","Good location, short walk from the airport shuttle stop.  Also close to the hop on hop off bus stop.  Plenty of restaurants in the nearby area.
What I didn't like as the noise.  We had to listen to to a bunch of drunken fights outside our window (had to keep the window open because it was so warm in our room with no apparent way of controlling the temp).  Also the bathroom was poorly designed.  The shower leaked onto the laminate floor and there were actually holes between the planks.",3,2018,04,22
219,The best Dublin hotel experience had in 50 years visiting this wonderful city,"My wife and I, with 3 daughters, son and 2 grandchildren stayed for just one night this week at the newly refurbished North Star Hotel in Dublin. We were headed for a musical at Bord Gais and chose the Hotel simply because it was convenient to Connolly train station and the theatre, and because its B&B rate was very competitive compared to a wide range of other hotels. BUT what we experienced was fantastic beyond our dreams. 
A warm welcome, endless support, advice and friendly service from every member of superb staff, delicious food at all meals, sumptuous room accommodation, and all in a truly beautiful and unique environment. The decor and design is fabulous. Without doubt the North Star Hotel will in future be our hotel of choice when in Dublin. Thank you so much North Star. You really are a star!!!",5,2018,04,19
219,Nice hotel,"The staff was friendly, the hotel was clean. There was a  restaurant in it.  I did not like being next to the train station.  I could hear the train go by, what felt like every 15 minutes, in my room.  I didn't particularly like the location.",4,2018,04,19
219,good value for money,The hotel has a great location (right by Connolly Station). The room was fine however the bed was not very comfortable (too soft and high up) and the walls were very thin. We had a premium room which gave us access to the premium lounge: a great extra! We had free drinks around the clock and free breakfast on weekdays. The lounge is spacious and has a great view! Unfortunately it was not very well serviced - one day there were no cups and another the coffee machine didn't work. All in all we had a good stay.,4,2018,04,18
219,"A nice hotel, nice atmosphere, room average","I arrived in the middle if the afternoon and realized it was difficult to drop off lugage in front of the hotel because you are in the middle of traffic. 
I got to park further up which was OK. They also recommend to park in the Connelly train station...
The welcome is nice! My room had 3 small beds just for me. I would have preferred a double bed... My view was almost directly on the train line and I felt I was sharing the travel with the people in the train!
I had one surprise though! Lights turn on automatically under the beds if you move at night... A sensor detects movements!!! The movement was a pillow falling from my bed and it startled me to have bright lines in the middle of my sleep!!! 
The hotel restaurant is OK... basic food like pizza and burgers... and service was long.
It is a good location to visit Dublin I was told...",4,2018,04,18
219,Outstanding!,"It had everything, breakfast to dinner, bar, and exceptional staff.  Particularly David in both McGettigans Cookhouse & Bar, and Martin the concierge.  Over the top in assistance, I can't say enough good about the whole facility!  Rooms clean, maids attentive.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Very friendly atmosphere and esthetically outstanding.  Everyone we saw was friendly and outgoing.",5,2018,04,18
219,"Modern, clean & quiet... a great choice !","I thought I had booked at the ""North Star Hotel"", but we were welcomed at the ""The Address"" check-in counter, in the same reception area. These are two buildings, two hotel brands in the same place. ""The Address"" seems to be the classy and expensive one.
Our experience was great. A kind young man took us into our room and showed us how to manipulate the fancy electronic features of the room. Room was spacious, very clean and super-quiet, even if it's located in a main road and a few metres away from an important tram station.
Breakfast buffet was great (we had booked the ""Full Irish Breakfast"" option), you won't feel hungry for a few hours for sure...
Getting to the airport was very easy. The ""Airlink"" bus 747 stops 100m from the hotel. 

Room for improvement?
1. The trainee at the check-out counter seemed angry or annoyed, perhaps it was too much work for her alone.
2. Please disable that ""automatic night light"" that turns on every time you step down from the bed. The light is too strong, and it wakes everybody up. Or at least, please reduce the intensity...",4,2018,04,18
219,Modern hotel opposite Connolly Station. ,"We stayed here for the final three nights of our Railtours Ireland holiday. 
It would have been selected for the convenient location of the station but it was also a very comfortable and modern hotel.
The area surrounding the hotel seemed a bit seedy and we often heard shouting and drunken behaviour at night. 
Our room was very spacious with an extra single bed. The open wardrobe area was cleverly designed with lots of hanging space and open drawers with a full length mirror incorporated within.
There were motion light sensors under the bedside tables so that if you got up at night these lights were activated as well as the bathroom lights. It was disconcerting at first until we understood how it worked.
The reception staff and buffet staff were very accommodating and as we had an early start on two mornings we were offered two breakfast bags with sandwiches, muffins, yogurt, apple and a bottle of water. This was a very good service. The actual buffet breakfast was average.",4,2018,04,17
219,Bitter Sweet Stay,"As someone who relies heavily on Trip Advisor to sway my decisions on places to visit and stay, it is important to leave as much feedback from my own experiences as possible. This hotel (North Star/The Address) is by far one of the more higher end hotels in Dublin. The new refurbishments are considerable and add a very high tech feel to the hotel. Alongside a contemporary design there has been a lot of thought with the interior d√©cor and finishing which adds a very comfortable, luxurious feel in public areas and the rooms. We booked for a breakfast which regrettably was poor value and choice. With still a good 40 minutes of breakfast service we were disappointed with the lack of replenishments and made the best of things with whatever was left. You have to take the lift right to the basement of the hotel to have breakfast and the room although comfortable is dark and poorly lit. Almost dingy.. I come now to the sleeping arrangements. The beds are absolutely fantastic and made by Respa who are a very reputable bed manufacturer in Ireland. The bed was huge and comfortable too.  Unfortunately at 3 am a couple of guests on our corridor thought it amusing to run around like Tarzan screaming and hollering for over 15 minutes whilst crashing and banging into doors as they did so. It was both frightening and disturbing. My partner had to challenge them over it as it was unbearable. I telephoned reception who organised security to address the matter.  We spoke to the duty manager in the morning who dealt with our complaint swiftly and responsively. It is such a shame that some people do not have any regard for decency, appreciation of nice places or any self respect. I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin. We always enjoy the Irish hospitality and food and drink. We had a wonderful stay and would come back to this hotel.",4,2018,04,16
219,Brilliant location - Beautiful hotel - NOISY housekeeping.,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights whilst on a couples break with my partner. The hotel is stunning. Perfectly located, around a 15 minute walk to the centre of Dublin. Lots of shops, cinemas, restaurants, casinos etc. Rooms are spotless! Restaurant downstairs serves delicious food too! 

PRO'S - 
Location, cleanliness, helpful staff, large rooms.

CON'S - 
HOUSEKEEPING. Oh my god are they noisy. It is almost impossible to sleep in past 8am. CONSTANT slamming of doors every few minutes. Literally infuriating! (They do a brilliant job, just not very considerate of customers! Would have been 5 stars if not for this).

VIEW - Our room faced a brick wall. Brilliant!..",4,2018,04,13
219,visiting our son,"We came to Dublin to visit our son and his girlfriend, who are both living and working in Dublin. This is already the third time we book the North Star Hotel. It is a nice hotel in the center of Dublin with friendly staff, near to train and other transport facilities .
We always enjoy our stay in this hotel.",4,2018,04,11
219,great hotel perfect location,"This was the last hotel of our vacation in Ireland and a great Hotel to spend the last leg of our trip. The room was perfect and had been newly renovated and the location could not better, within walking distance to many of Dublin's tourist attractions.  Driving in Dublin is not fun and of course we had a car. However, there was a public parking lot at the O'Connell Street Train Station, a short walk from the Hotel.  The breakfasts were typical of the other hotels we stayed at during our trip.  The hotel also provided a Hospitality Area with drinks and assorted snacks.  That came in handy when one got the craving for something to munch on at odd times.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful  and very responsive to our needs.",5,2018,04,10
219,Great Location. But that's about it.,"The North Star was a convenient location to start our Dublin/Belfast trip. Our room was adequate and clean. The staff seemed aloof, not super-welcoming. Construction was occurring next to the desk, which was unpleasant. Our room was on the second floor, no elevator to this part of the building. Thank goodness we were relatively fit, because no offer of helping with our luggage was  made. Our first night was ok, as we were pretty knackered once we turned in. The next night was something else all together. It was unbearably hot, it could not be regulated, the window was unable to be opened sufficiently, and the outside noise was incredible. At 10pm, a bucket truck appeared and a workman was raised to the sign outside our window to do repairs....and a metal plate covering some road work made a horrid sound everytime a car passed over it (not the hotel's fault on that, but it added insult to injury).",2,2018,04,10
219,Pleasant lunch,"We had a very pleasant business lunch here today enjoying good food in comfortable surroundings. The staff were efficient and friendly and the value was good. Well done to them all. Also, a great measure of a place, the loos are immaculate!",4,2018,04,10
219,Perfect for a midweek trip!,"Had a lovely three night stay at this hotel for a great price (booked through expedia)! Hotel was really close to O'Connell street and within walking distance of most (if not all) of the main tourist attractions. The beds were so comfortable and the room was really clean. We were the other side of the hotel so weren't able to hear any trains at night which was great. The shower was also great. The only downside was the slight confusion over breakfast on the last day, which I had paid for in cash for the night before not being registered however we were still able to have a full irish buffet! The wifi was really temperamental in our room: slow and would often disconnect.",4,2018,04,09
219,Super hotel! It is 4* but I would give it all 5 stars.,"I travelled with my wife and younger daughter. We all enjoyed our staying there. Excellent service, perfect stuff. I saw many trainees there  but they all were absolutely professional and obliging. And smiled a lot. The room we got was very beautiful, spacious and convenient. 

The hotel has everything you need and even more. You may go to 
the sauna or to the gym. With their restaurant and cafe one does not need to go out. Everything is very tasty!

The hotel's location is great. Just 10-12 minutes of walking and you find yourself on O'Connel street near the Spire.

If you want to explore Ireland by train kust cross the street and you are at Connolly Station.

That was my second trip to Ireland, The first one was 20 years ago. I wanted to show my family how beautiful, interesting and fabulous this country is. I acheived a success in that and the hotel helped me a lot as it is very important to come back from your trips to a comfortable and hospitable place. Next time I will definitely try to stay there.

P.S. Wi-fi is good and available everywhere in the hotel.
PP.SS. If someone from the hotel reads my message please accept my gratitude and best wishes from Moscow!",5,2018,04,08
219,Very good ,"We stayed here for a weekend when attending a gig in the 3 arena which was very easy to get to from the hotel.

Hotel it‚Äôs self was lovely, room was very nice with a balcony and a expresso machine.

Bed was nice and big and comfy, we ate in the restaurant on both nights food was excellent great value and the restaurant staff was also very friendly and very helpful.

All hotel staff were lovely I found this hotel to be warm and welcoming and would recommend it.

We got at deal ‚Ç¨297 for 2 nights without breakfast, for Dublin city wasn‚Äôt bad.
I will stay again.

",4,2018,04,08
219,Enjoyed my stay,"We had a premium room so we had a fridge in the room and also access to the Premium Lounge which alright, you could make coffee, tea or hot chocolate there or grab a water bottle. From 6am to 9am there was also a light breakfast served which consisted of croissants, fruit salad and yogurt. The hotel was really clean and the room was alright. I booked via Booking.com and the photos there didn't match the room that we got but that might've been Booking.com's fault. The location was nice, a 10 minute walk from the Temple Bar area and the airport bus drop off was just around the corner. Wifi was fast and worked great.",4,2018,04,06
219,Excellent accomodation,"The hotel was very convenient for our City visit, rooms were very clean, comfortable and modern. The staff could nor have been nicer or more helpful. A good breakfast was served in very nice surroundings.",5,2018,04,06
219,So incredibly special!,"What can I say - everything has been amazing!! The taxi from the airport only cost 21 Euros which was a lot less than what we were quoted - very friendly and helpful driver too. On arrival, the hotel lobby is beautiful, really unexpected. The staff were friendly and greeted us warmly and we were able to check in at 9.30am despite thinking it would be 2pm as the website says. We were also upgraded to a suite, free of charge, which was a wonderful touch. The room was stunning, very clean and full of little extras. Bed was very comfy and bath and shower both worked well. The restaurant and the Parlor were both fantastic and reasonably priced - would definitely recommend if you don't fancy going out in to Dublin. However, the location of the hotel is great - we were able to walk to the Jameson's distillery in 20 minutes and the Guinness Storehouse in 45 minutes. Also 20 minutes from Temple Bar. I would highly recommend the North Star - although I suppose I'm kind of biased as this ended up being the place where my boyfriend proposed to me!!!",5,2018,04,06
219,Lovely and convenient,This is a great place to stay. The hotel is right on the Airlink line from the airport so easy to get to and from. It‚Äôs within walking distance of great restaurants and great tours. The rooms are clean and spacious and the amenities are nice. The restaurant in The hotel is also great. My only suggestion is to get rid of the musty smell in the bathroom. Maybe that‚Äôs just damp Dublin? AND get rid of the car alarm that goes off at least twice a night and wakes you up. ,4,2018,04,05
219,A good choice in Dublin,"Stayed here when i was in Dublin for a concert at the 3arena. The hotel is nice and clean, decent room size and great breakfast. The restaurant is lovely with great food and drinks.
We stayed at a premier room with good standard and access to premier lounge. The bathroom was small with hardwood floor and was a bit downside regarding the room.",3,2018,04,05
219,Highly recommend,"Stayed here Easter Sunday - Tues to celebrate my 40th Birthday. Well what can i say.... staff were lovely and really helpful.  Even got us into our rooms 3 hours early as we'd had an early flight. Rooms and whole hotel overall is absolutely spotless and breakfast was delicious with lots of choice (buffet style) fill Irish was lovely. Didn't use gym sauna etc but looked great and really well equipped. The bar staff were great too and good advising on where to go and their humour was great. Liam, Aiden and Sean were all lovely guys and a great laugh. Will definately visit again and recommend to anyone ",5,2018,04,04
219,travelled to Dublin for my birthday with family,Stayed here in august17 when we were at Dublin horse show as it was the most reasonably priced. Food was fabulous. So went back in February 2018. so handy to train station so we hadn't far to walk.Rooms spotless breakfast ok but other meals fabulous. I had Dublin bay skillet of fish it was unbelievably tasty. Staff all very friendly and welcoming particularly staff in bar and restaurant.,5,2018,04,01
219,WOW!,"What an amazing hotel!!! I cannot stress that enough! Me and my boyfriend stayed in the club suite in the ‚Äòaddress‚Äô part of the North Star and wow! Incredible room! Amazing and more than helpful staff! , best hotel we have ever stayed in! Room was immaculately clean, and they make sure they fulfill every little detail from robes and slippers, mini fridge with complimentary snacks, and a lovely staff member gave us a little chocolate bunny for Easter. I will certainly be staying in this hotel when I am back in Dublin. I highly recommend this hotel just amazing! Thank you all at the North Star/Address for a wonderful stay :)",5,2018,04,01
219,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on 23rd march, checking in was quick. we had two lovely modern rooms one room was a disabled twin room with a large wet room and very comfortable Beds and my room was a double room very modern and clean. The Bar restaurant was amazing with a very good menu also very modern bar area the staff were all very friendly and helpful .The breakfast room was again very modern with a great selection for Breakfast.This hotel is just across the road from Connolly  train station and close to all the shops and tourist attractions. I would definitely stay in this nice modern hotel again.",5,2018,03,31
219,Lovely üòä ,"Arrived here for a friends birthday, the husband and I have a delightful room with a absolutely huge bed, can barely touch him it‚Äôs so big! The technology on the wall for lighting is fab, as soon a you put a leg out of bed the floor lights come on to guide you to the bathroom! Great decor. Friendly staff. The view from the room isn‚Äôt great (the bins) but apart from that is a beautifully decorated comfortable hotel. ",4,2018,03,31
219,Eye opener ,"
We haven't been back to the Northstar in many years and what a transformation. The sence of space and light through out the interior was fabulous. I was eagor to dine in the bar like last time, after my nose around and once again pleasently surprised not only by its new additions but to see some familiar faces. My thirst and curiosity were quickly quenched with my dozen or so questions at the bar thanks again Deirdre and John for the recommendations.  We had a very relaxing evening, well fed and water before hopping on the train again. Great to see you guys again Keith.

219,lovely hotel,"Just back from a 3 night stay in a classic twin room. I was a little worried about booking this hotel after reading certain reviews online regarding the rooms but we must of been lucky to get a newly refurbished room.  Arrived at hotel 10am and was able to check in straight away.  Hotel room was clean and modern.  Had everything we needed, iron board, iron, tea and coffee making facilities, air con, safe and tv.  Not that we spent much time in the room as we had so much to see and do in Dublin.  After spending all day in the city visiting the tourist attractions it was nice to get back to the hotel for a lovely cocktail or two in the bar and get a decent nights sleep in the comfortable bed.  The hotel is across the road from the train station and the train line is above a certain part of the hotel.  I guess if you are a light sleeper then the trains can disturb a good nights sleep.  We did not encounter any issues in this hotel and found all members of staff to be very helpful and friendly. We got the airlink bus from Dublin airport which took roughly 40 minutes and the stop is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  Temple bar area is only a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel.  Will definitely recommend this hotel to others.",4,2018,03,29
219,Would visit again!,"The hotel room we booked was a comfort double. Although quite small it was very comfortable and extremely clean. 

Unfortunately for us the TV had constant subtitles on which couldn‚Äôt be removed, the fire alarm was set off at 7am so very early morning wake up and we awoke to around 50 plus people outside our window as a pick up point üò©

As this was supposed to be our relaxation break we decided we would ask if we could move rooms. The hotel was virtually full however the helpful gentleman said we could move to a premier room for a small fee. We decided we would move and infact within 30 mins they moved us to a suite on the top floor with access to the premier lounge (free coffee and biscuits is basically what this was) 

We were extremely pleased with how they handled this and it made our stay. 

If you want food after 11pm with room service I would say don‚Äôt bother! It‚Äôs overpriced and there are only a couple of options and a complete rigmarole to order even at the front desk. As the front of house guy expressed... the chef had left so no real food available ü§î

Not enough to put us off staying again as they really did accommodate us well and it is a location out of the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to any busy area.

Brilliant breakfast choices!!! ",4,2018,03,27
219,Andrew Durkin ,Really enjoyed our stay in the North Star. Room comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. Lovely bar for a drink after day in the city. Allowed us to leave our luggage in safe keeping on check out while we spent the afternoon in the city. Will definitely be back ,5,2018,03,26
219,Book Elsewhere! ,"I am not one to complain about a hotel but I felt I really should let everyone know what a disappointment this hotel was. It looks nice enough but the staff really let the place down.
They are so unhelpful, and I found this with several members of staff on the front desk not just one in particular. 
We booked a double room and there was nothing about a twin room on my accommodation voucher and email however the staff was certain it was a twin room we had booked they didn‚Äôt seem to care this was their fault and they refused to move us to a double room on either of the 2 nights we stayed. Also the air-conditioning did not work and the room was very hot which meant we had to sleep with the window open and the hotel has a train line above it so very noisy. 
The drinks in the bar are extortionate! 
And the concierge desk never had a staff member on it to help with tourist questions. 
They also have problems with the smoke alarm being set off early hours so don‚Äôt expect to get a lay in as this was going off at 7 am!
Please don‚Äôt let this hotel ruin your city break and book somewhere with better reviews and somewhere a bit closer to the centre.",2,2018,03,25
219,Attending the U2 Joshua Tree tour,"From the moment we entered the North Star hotel we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome. The bedroom was comfortable, stylish and impeccably clean. our stay included a continental breakfast in the rooftop breakfast area which had a wonderful bird's eye view of Dublin on a sleepy Sunday morning. we had a great stay and look forward to returning.I would recommend this hotel.",5,2018,03,22
219,A comedy of errors!,"I booked this hotel thinking it would be a great base of operations while I toured around Dublin a bit, finished up some last minute items for Graduate School, and got ready to fly home the next day.   It ended up being a relatively sleepless night and I couldn't leave the hotel quick enough.

First, parking is not clearly marked.  At all.   I spent an hour, going around in circles, attempting to find parking.   There isn't a valet out front - like you would expect at most hotels where there isn't an attached parking garage.   When I did find a spot on the street, I went inside and asked the host if there was parking nearby.   Never did anyone ask me if I had any trouble finding the place or even how I was doing - which struck me as very odd.   I was told there was parking across the street and was given a map.

Okay, better, right?   The parking across the street is really about two blocks away.  I did park there but I'm glad I only had weekend bags with me - anything larger would have been a pain to get into the hotel.  

I went to the room on the first floor.  My view?  What I'm pretty sure was some HVAC equipment and a bunch of ladders.  I figured I was only there for the night and I didn't get the hotel for the view so why bother trying to move.

It got worse from there.

It was the little things, really.  First, the plugs.  In order to plug in your laptop, you either need to crawl beneath a desk to get to the outlet in the corner or you need to plug in at the shelf/desk right beneath the TV.  If you chose the outlet right beneath the TV and sit there, the TV is only inches from you face....assuming you can even watch the TV.   The stations didn't work until the next morning.  

Wi-fi - it's open access.  Most hotels, your wifi is your room number with the password being some combination of your name with number.  It offers some semblance of security.  Here, everyone gets the same wifi username and password.  Don't ""sign-in"" unless you want your information visible to absolutely everyone in the building.  

I went to take a bath only to realize a very important design flaw in the bathroom.  There is a glass door that covers the tub from the middle to the wall where the door to enter the bathroom is.  The problem?   If you go to turn the water on and someone else comes in to get a brush or something else in the bathroom, the bathroom door would hit the glass door.  Not a good idea.  If you try to get into the tub without moving the glass door - it is possible- but you have to climb over the toilet.  

Also, the lights for the bathroom are outside of the bathroom.  There is no way to turn off the ""makeup"" light around the square mirror which made your eyes look...off.  Really, it made it look like your pupils were rectangles.   All the lights in the bathroom had to be on or they all had to be off.  There was no in-between.

And then there were the automatic lights under the shelves on either side of the bed.  Oh my.   These disastrous super bright LED lights are the main reason I could not sleep most of the night.  If anything moved even slightly in front of the sensors on either side of the bed, the lights came on.   These were not nightlights - these were more like reading lights - very bright and annoying.  So, if you happen to toss and turn a bit when you sleep and the comforter moves slightly on the side of the bed BOOM!  Lights come back on.  Each time.   I woke up a good three or four times thanks to those lights!

Another fun item was the heating and A/C.  It was snowing when I arrived at the hotel.   After an hour in the room, I was curious as to why I was getting so cold until I looked at the thermostat and realized it wasn't on.  Okay, no big deal, right?   I turned it on and...it was on A/C.   The A/C was loud - like a baseball card was stuck in the vent.  I eventually got it to the heat and that worked until, for whatever reason, at 3 am the thermostat switched back to the A/C and I got the baseball card sound again.  I marched over to the thermostat and switched it back to the heat.

Around 5:30 am, I noticed a smell.   The smell got stronger as the morning wore on.   At 6 am, I gave up on sleeping - it was hopeless with the noise and the lights- and began to work on a school paper instead.   Around this time, I realized what the smell was - it was paint.  Specifically, acetone based wet paint.  I have no idea where the smell was coming from but there was a sign that some remodeling was going on.

Once I finished my paper, I packed up quickly and went to check out.  Oh yes, you can very clearly hear the trains in the lobby.   Normally, at check out, the host asks you how your stay was or if there were any issues, ect.  Nope!   I just handed my key over and he checked to make sure there weren't any charges to the room.   It was all very surreal.

So, was there anything positive about this comedy of errors?  Yes - the room was clean.   There is a grocery store on the corner and the Chinese take out just down the street is phenomenal. You won't go hungry in this area.   Despite all that, I won't stay here again.",2,2018,03,21
219,St Patricks stay,"Myself and my partner recently stayed for 3 nights in the North Star. First impressions were fantastic. The room looked great and is in a fantastic location  however the room was incredibly hot and the air conditioning wasn't working. We had to sleep with the window open and as the hotel is right by the railway line the trains kept us up. It snowed during our stay but the room was so hot we still had to sleep with the window open.

Perhaps it was just this room and we were unlucky.

Due to the snow our flight was cancelled so we returned after checking out that morning to see if they could give us a room for one more night as the location is brilliant. Unfortunately we were shocked when the man behind reception advised us the very best on a room (bearing in mind we had already stayed for 3 nights) was ¬£150. When I pointed out that if I book online the rate was showing ¬£131 he shrugged and said that was the best. We stayed in another hotel which was quieter, normal temperature for just 85 euros. Customer service goes a long way and unfortunately after a brilliant holiday left a bad taste for us for the north star",3,2018,03,21
219,"Hi-tech, modern and beautiful hotel. Friendly and helpful staff.","Stayed at the Address for 2 nights this weekend gone. On arrival we were given a very warm welcome and checked in early and swiftly. The room was beautiful all very hi-tech and a huge bed that was so comfortable, it was a shame we didn't spend very much time at the hotel at all. The view from the rooftop terrace is stunning. Breakfast in the morning was plentiful and a huge variety. The hotel is located next to the train track but this did not bother us at all, yes you can hear the trains sometimes but it is not disruptive in any way. 
The staff were helpful and friendly and our stay was amazing. I would certainly return. Thank you for a very pleasant stay.",5,2018,03,20
219,Great hotel near the station,"We arrived at the hotel to be met by friendly and helpful staff on the desk.Although our room was in the older part of the hotel, it was clean, comfortable and very roomy. We had a problem with the heating which when reported was sorted extremely quickly. We booked breakfast in the hotel which was exceptionally good with lots of choice and plenty to eat. All the staff were very friendly and helpful which made our stay enjoyable. Well done North Star Hotel.

219,Poor Customer Service - will never book here again!,"I can't tell you about the facilities at this hotel because our trip was cancelled due to the snow on the 2nd Feb 2018... The hotel refused to refund us the money even though this was out of our control. Had our flights not been cancelled we would have been there snow or no snow! To be fair we booked nonrefundable rooms, however I do not have any control on the weather or whether flights get cancelled or not! There wasn't even an option to transfer the booking to another date, which would have considered...",1,2018,03,19
219,St Patrick's Day in Dublin at the North Star Hotel,"We arrived at the North Star Hotel on St Patrick's day ready to enjoy the celebrations and first impressions were good.
Unfortunately we had several major issues with the room we were allocated, examples being TV not working, telephone not working, incorrect bed allocation to our booking, along with number of serious health and safety issues which I will not detail on here, basically the room had been very recently refurbished to a poor standard, the renovations had only been completed the day before our stay, but the room was in fact not finished and should not have been allocated to guests in the state we found it in.
I made several complaints and finally got to speak to the front of house manager Ela. The issues with the room could not be resolved so after lengthy discussions with Ela we were finally moved to other rooms with the original room taken out of use.
Not the best start to our St Patrick's Day celebrations.
During our stay we spent some time in the bar having drinks and food both of which were lovely and reasonably priced.
Other than the issues we encountered we found it to be a nice hotel with some great facilities, about a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar and central area of Dublin.
So we left with mixed feelings but tried not to let the problems spoil our weekend away.
I have left a poor rating because average would be too generous and terrible would be a bit harsh as we did enjoy other parts of our stay in the hotel.
A big thank you to Ela for assisting us and for providing a resolution to the issues we encountered.",2,2018,03,19
219,A fabulous place to stay...,"Five of us booked an overnight stay to see the Sterephonics in the 3arena. The North Star is directly across from Connolly station & a 10-15min stroll into O'Connell street, the luas & busaras literally 2mins down the street.
On arrival...we were greeted by a lovely gentleman, big warm smile and he escorted us to the check-in desk...there was an issue with our rooms ( we booked rooms next to each other online but the rooms they had for us were not on same floor) but the staff were so accommodating, they suggested that if we wanted to leave our luggage and wait an hour to check-in that they could organise two triple rooms next to each other (rather than our booked triple & twin) at no extra cost. We gladly accepted as had planned to go into town shopping anyway. The rooms were nicely decorated and lots of natural light, a decent hairdryer, ironing facilities, the beds were very comfortable.
The bar has a nice chilled atmosphere and the cocktails were delicious.We didnt eat here as had plans made elsewhere.
Its a pity we were only there for the one night, but we have booked a two night stay here again in December,so hopefully we will get to enjoy more of the hotel then. Great staff, great location, fabulous hotel. Cant wait! üòä",5,2018,03,18
219,Great Location,"My husband and I stay for 2 days leading up to St Patricks Day. The hotel staff went above and beyond. We were greeted at the reception area with checking in a swift and easy process. 
We were then escorted to our room by a friendly staff member.  Once there he explained all we needed to know about the room and how to use the remote which controlled the lights in the room.  On the walls were the controls for all the lights. Nice touch was a remote (from the bed) to open and close the curtains.
The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. We didn't need to bring and toiletries. Made available were lotions, shampoos, cream rinse as well as hand soaps.
Only issued I had was the lights were on automatic. So when my husband got up in the middle of the night. A motioned sensor light from under the night stands came on. Which was good for him. Not so good for me. They were  bright and I was then awake for the remainder of the night.  I did not remember the next night to check the settings for the next night.(my mistake)
Also available was a roof top area. With complimentary coffee and tea. Nice touch with a little bit of outdoors. Nice view of the City.
Hotel location  across from Connolly Station which was a great location for us. We were within walking distance to Connolly Street and most of the downtown area. (8-10 minute walk). 
We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2018,03,17
219,6 Nations Visit,"From walking off the street we were very impressed with the Hotel! Apparently recently refurbished and you could tell. Friendly staff through out. Spent two nights here and the only fault was you didn't get a biscuit in the room to have with your tea/coffee. Don't know about you but I always rate a hotel by the quality of the biscuit. Unfortunately there were none.... reception had a little cake from.the porters but just bit the same. Great bar and bar food....

Sadly the room we were allocated had a malfunctioning temperature control meaning it was constantly set to max temperature and it was around 20 degrees all night. After three visits to reception and some claims they were trying to bring someone in to fix it we managed to get moved to another room.

It is a very clean hotel with good sized rooms, with regular towel changes etc. Good food available in the restaurant, which we took advantage of after our trip over from North Wales. The staff are extremely friendly and courteous and the location is ideal, close to the main station and shops. We will certainly be going back there next time we visit Dublin.",5,2018,02,26
219,The Northstar Hotel,"The Northstar Hotel is in a fantastic location, its literally on the doorstep of Connolly street train station. When we arrived they didn't have the triple room we had booked available so by way of compensation they upgraded us to two deluxe rooms right next to each other and gave us access to the club lounge.  Finally I left items behind in the safe and on realising this when I returned home, the staff in housekeeping made sure they were returned to me safely and seemlessly.  Excellent service and facilities also.",4,2018,02,19
219,"Trully, comfortable, welcoming and friendly experience.","i have stayed in many hotels, but this hotel was top notch. My review is based on not just how comfortable i feel but on how at home i feel in the environment. The rooms are very good, with amazing technical features that will have any geek dribbling. the bed is amazing and i had a wonderful couple of nights sleep. The staff are really friendly and have a smile and a hello whenever you see them. i give it 5 stars because i really cannot fault it. if i were it would be just 1 thing and that is the water pressure for the shower. i was on the 7th floor and a shower existed as a light rain. i managed to get clean though eventually.",5,2018,02,19
219,Good stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights and really enjoyed it, the room was spacious and beautifully decorated. Very clean as well. All the staff were very friendly and welcoming, no matter the hour. Nothing at all to complain about ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,2018,02,18
219,Perfect weekend ,Had a lovely 1 night stay on Valentine's weekend the staff were extremely helpful and nice. We stayed in 536 and found no problems with noise. The smart room is really well designed and user friendly. We can't wait to come back!! ,5,2018,02,18
219,Lovely Hotel & Staff,"We stayed for 1 night while attending a concert, every single staff member was helpful welcoming and friendly. We were upgraded on check in, our room was spacious, warm and clean with all the amenities you would expect . Lovely bathroom and a Nespresso machine in room.
We had lunch, coffees and drinks in the Cookhouse bar and restraunt it was lovely and reasonably priced for Dublin.
The North Star will def be our go to hotel for future trips to dublin.
Management should be super proud of their staff.",5,2018,02,14
219,Excellent stay,"We have just finished a five night stay at The Address. We loved our stay.  We arrived to an elegant lobby with friendly staff.  A member escorted us to the room and explained how the smart room works.  The room is ‚Äúhigh tech‚Äù and we were shown how to use everything.  Some previous posters complained of the motion light at night.  This must have been disabled because there was no motion light in our room.  Also, some have complained of the train noise.  We were in 641, over looking the tracks.  We could only hear the trains slightly.  We used a white noise app at night and couldn‚Äôt hear anything.  We couldn‚Äôt hear anything from the rooms around us either.  The rooms seem very well sound proofed.  We found the rooms and hotel to be quiet and peaceful.  The room itself is modern and clean with very comfortable beds.  There is an espresso machine, fridge and daily water-still and sparkling provided.  Also, there were robes and slippers.  My only complaint is the nice comforter on the bed is very warm and wrapped in a duvet.  I would have preferred a top sheet as well because I got too hot under the comforter and when I took it off, I then had no cover.  So, if you get hot under a big comforter, perhaps request a top sheet-I should have done this.

Room service was reasonably priced and good quality with quick delivery.

Location- Some previous posters have complained that the area is ‚Äúsketchy‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt understand this at all.  The hotel is right across from the Connolly train station so it is well lit and busy with people all the time.  The area felt no less safe than any other part of Dublin.  In fact we felt safer walking back at night because it is so well lit and busy.  It was very convenient to be right across the street from the train, LUAS, DART and taxis.  

Staff was friendly and helpful.  We had a very good stay and would definitely return.",5,2018,02,13
219,Fantastic Hotel,"What a fantastic hotel ! Great service on check in and throughout our stay we were made to feel welcome. Stayed for 3 nights on 7th Floor ‚ÄòThe Address‚Äô. Room was stunning, very modern where you can control everything from the tv ! Also had access to the roof top lounge. What a fab idea that is. Really chilled out place that is only for 7th floor guests (sorry everyone else) Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and is ideal for a weekend break. ",5,2018,02,12
219,Very nice hotel with great location ,"Stayed feb 10th for a concert in the 3 arena. The hotel is lovely, luxury finish to the hotel and very chic. Had dinner in the bar and the food / menu was lovely. Nice bar to chill out in the evening for cocktails. ‚Äò the parlour‚Äô coffee dock have a nice range of fresh pastries /
Scones. 

Easy check in, room was modern with lots of technology. 

Perfect city centre hotel and will certainly return again. ",5,2018,02,11
219,Fab week end away ,"My partner booked a surprise trip away and have to say was over the moon with the hotel. The interior is gorgeous, there is a beautifully decorated parkour for light bites and cakes, a great grill house attached which was very welcoming. 

The staff  at check in were fantastic we stupidly booked a twin room explain to staff and they changed our room straight over. We got room service and the food was gorgeous 

Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin. It's central to occonnel  street (10 min walk) 

Thank you!! ",5,2018,02,11
219,Great hotel ,"Amazing hotel, clean comfy, very modern, we stayed in ‚ÄúThe Address‚Äù part of the hotel, great room all automated, full wet room hotel, only disappointment is the gym is very old and not well equipped. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk away from the city centre. Staff are very friendly and happy to help, our room gives us access to a coffee lounge on the top floor, the lounge would be better if it had soft drinks too. ",5,2018,02,10
219,Exceptional Hotel,"Very impressed with the North Star Hotel.

We had a very warm welcome from the reception staff who quickly resolved a booking mistake we made. (Booked a twin room instead of a double). 

The room had plenty of space and storage for everything we needed. There were 2 desks, 3 chairs, safe, nespresso machine, massive tv and a very luxurious bathroom.

The conseierge were very helpful and gave us some great advice of places to visit as well as saving us money on the main attractions.

The hotel is very close to the centre of the city and very easy to find.

Thank you for a fab stay.",5,2018,02,04
219,location,"Hotel was in and ideal location within walking distance to everything.. The lunch we had was amazing . All the staff were very good. Breakfast was very tasty. Checkout was quick and easy 
 We got the shuttle bus to the airport.",5,2018,01,29
219,Lovely modern rooms and friendly staff,"We visited The Address this weekend after my girlfriend bought me a trip to Dublin as a gift. We arrived at approx 8.30am and wasn‚Äôt expecting to be able to check in, however the front desk staff were very accommodating and got the room ready early. We were shown to the room personally by a member of staff who also showed as all the new tech in the refurbished rooms.
The room was great, modern, clean with a gigantic bed!
We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel (would recommend Trocadero in town if you book early enough) however we had a drink in the bar which was also lovely. Would definitely stay again! ",5,2018,01,28
219,Absolutely Stunning.,"Myself and husband stayed here this weekend 26th Jan 2018.Everything from check in to check out was perfect.From the moment we arrived we where made to feel welcome.The room we stayed in 768 was absolutely stunning.The bed and decor in the bedroom where flawless.The surrounding areas in the hotel where stunning as its newly renovated.The restaurant is impeccable and has some of the finest food and drinks.Its a 5 minute walk to √í connell street and the city centre where you'll find shops, restaurants and bars a plenty.100 % Recommend this hotel 5 *.",5,2018,01,28
219,Ideal for a city visit,"I‚Äôve stayed here a couple of times as we found the location really handy. It is still quite central to the main town, about a 10/15 minute walk from the busier nightlife but still with a few nice local pubs even closer for a quieter night. The beds are a very good size - and the decor is nice. 

All in all a good option for a cheaper stay than some places in Dublin that doesn‚Äôt leave you miles away from the action - and is very handy for both tram and rail access. ",4,2018,01,26
219,Fantastic hotel,"I was surprised for my 21st birthday with this hotel. I was very impressed with the welcome we received. Lovely staff, very friendly and always said hello to you. The room (we were upgraded to the Oscar Wilde suite) we couldn‚Äôt fault it. They went to the effort to provide the best possible birthday, with a card, mini chocolates and prosecco all on request. The room was clean, tidy, spacious with the breakfast having a good choice to eat. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to returning soon n the nearby future.",5,2018,01,26
219,Like sleeping on the train station,"Just back from a short overnight business trip in Dublin. Nice looking hotel, pleasantly decorated room (though recent renovation skipped the dated shower it seems). But the NOISE... I have lived all my life in busy cities and so I am not particularly noise sensitive, but in the early morning hours the whole room started shaking with trains thundering past right in front of the window (room 633). Never ever ever again - I suspect this is why you get charged on check in, as most people would be instantly gone otherwise. Shame - the staff is otherwise nice and the small caf√© a little gem.",1,2018,01,24
219,"A nice try at quality, but the veneer of quality is thin . . .","I don't leave reviews, I take the rough with the smooth, but this place annoyed me by charging me like a Four Star business hotel like The Spencer, but delivering like a budget hotel that's just had a refit.

Charged on arrival - always a bad sign.

Windows don't keep the noise of drunks and bin men out, keeping you awake into the night and waking you early, which kind of negated the problem of the building work starting at 07:30am. . .

I reported the building work the first morning, but again this morning it was there, so the really nice people at reception are at best ineffectual.

Rooms are nice, but if you are in ""The Address"" you'll have to have two key cards as you can't get to the Level 0 breakfast room, plus two sets of wi-fi credentials.

The people getting special treatment in the ""Club Room"" assigned to residents at The Address all looked depressed by the little room on the 7th with a measly selection of meats and cheeses, fruit and cereals, I'd assert we all felt like we'd been duped.

On the two mornings I visited it, I heard guests complaining - This is below the level of quality that business travelers expect.

We are away from our families, a little love and attention would have been nice.

And you'll have to take the right lift or you cant get to Level 0.

It's like they have two establishments but were too tight to separate it properly, which would have improved the experience immeasurably.

They have tried hard, but the look is not underpinned by quality - each thing is a cheap version of it and many things feel flimsy.

The staff, though unfailingly polite, are too pushed with things to do to pay the attention that 233 Euro a night warrants.

People say about places  ""I wouldn't stay there if you paid me"", but in this case, I actually wouldn't.",2,2018,01,24
219,Fantastic Hotel,"My fianc√© booked our trip to Dublin for us as a little get away before our baby is born, and being my birthday soon, he asked, when booking, if they could make it extra special. So when we arrived in our room, I was greeted by a beautiful bunch of flowers and some chocolates. What a wonderful surprise!! The staff where so accommodating and made us feel so welcome. Bed was super comfy and lots of pillows, as being pregnant it's helpful having extra to sleep with. 
The location is great, 5/10 min walk to centre and 3/5 minutes to a main bus station so was easy to get to and from airport. Would definitely recommend this hotel. 
Thank you North Star for a lovely stay. You made our trip extra special. ",5,2018,01,21
219,Excellent service,"I stayed there for 2 nights in December. Great location right next to the train and bus stations. Also the airport bus stops right around the corner so very convenient to get there from the airport.
I found the hotel personnel very polite, friendly and helpful, especially the staff at the reception. I was offered a complimentary access to the 7th floor lounge area, which was a nice bonus: quiet and comfortable area to work or just relax.
My room was on the sixth floor, spacious, clean and comfortable. No noise from the outside. 
I would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,01,17
219,Well worth 4star rating,Hotel is 15 min walk to temple bar. Great location.  Rooms nice. Bed very comfy.  Hotel is lovely inside. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Service excellent. Will definitely stay here again. Thanks,5,2018,01,14
219,Nice Hotel to stay over for a night.,"I found the staff to be polite and friendly during my stay, the hotel was clean and a nice location close to the main areas but far away enough to be quiet.
The room was very simple but a little dated, I was give a room for 4 people (all they had available) so bathroom was full of towels which was not necessary, but not enough tea/coffee for 4 people.
The beds and linen need to be replaced, I noted this after rolling into the middle of the bed due to an old mattress.
All in all, an okay stay. nothing WOW to make me return so will explore more in Dublin next time!",3,2018,01,14
219,Very Comfortable,We stayed in 'The Address' an exclusive little wing added to the hotel with a rooftop lounge. Room was very comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast was excellent. Staff were courteous and friendly. No car parking.,4,2018,01,10
219,No problems,"Stayed here two nights and there was nothing we could complain about. Rooms were a little outdated, as were the bathrooms, but since they were kept very clean this wasn't an issue. 

Some good bars and restaurants a short walk from the hotel and a bus station just around the corner to get you around the place.",4,2018,01,07
219,"Nice reception areas, poor room","Hotel looks lovely on arrival, nice contemporary feel, but our family room was cramped with stained carpet and broken floor and wall tiles in the bathroom - and the most uncomfy beds we've ever slept in, hard round the edge and no support in the middle. Other reviews and room pics look nice so I guess room 350 is one 'waiting refurb'. I competed a feedback email with these comments and got no response.",2,2018,01,05
219,"Nice, good location - No A/C or elevator","We stayed in the smaller side of North Star and there was no A/C or an elevator. Elevator didn't pose a huge issue for us as we were able to lug our baggage up the two flights of stairs, but wasn't ideal! Parking is close by - down the street. It is located close to a lot of public transportation. 
Breakfast was FANTASTIC!!! Lots of options. Bed was comfy.",4,2018,01,04
219,Not worth the money,"Just back from a 3 night stay here over New Year as party of 14, but I can honestly say I didn‚Äôt have great experience in the slightest. On arrival the hotel staff were quick to aid with checking in but after getting to the room the key card wouldn‚Äôt work, seems they‚Äôve been having huge problems with the doors not working properly. After finally getting the door to work, and unpacking everything we discovered that the toilet wasn‚Äôt working, staff came to look at it but it obviously couldn‚Äôt be fixed quickly so we were moved to another room. Not great after unpacking but better than having to wait on the toilet being fixed. The room we were given was clearly one of the more ‚Äúupdated‚Äù rooms they have shown on the website, and I can‚Äôt complain too much other than the silly motion sensor lights in the bedroom and bathroom that come on anytime there‚Äôs slight movement. Not great if you‚Äôre a light sleeper like me, so we had to stuff the throw pillows in front of it to block the light. 
All in all, the hotel is definitely not worth the price they charge and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone, especially with absolute joke of the breakfast being ‚Ç¨16.50 and the spar next door selling breakfast rolls for ‚Ç¨2! Could definitely stay in a nicer hotel that includes breakfast for less.",2,2018,01,02
219,Pleasantly surprised,"Stayed here just one night. Usually I book something south of the river but this time booked with family on the north side. Well located near the centre, train and bus station. Nice hotel. Well appointed, nice rooms, clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Pity that you have to book with breakfast on the hotels own website, while on booking.com you have a choice of room only. I would recommend this hotel and will definitely visit again",4,2017,12,30
219,Wonderful hotel-amazing service,Amazing hotel from start to finish.Arrived on an early morning flight to be told our room was ready-makes such a difference when you're on a short weekend break.Room well appointed and cosy.Staff attentive and polite.Great location for the arena and the centre of Dublin.Takes around 15 minutes to walk to Grafton Street.Thank you for a lovely stay -can't wait to return!!,5,2017,12,29
219,"Nice rooms, awful noise","I'm just back from a one night stay at this hotel. Firstly the positives are that the rooms are lovely, modern and well equipped and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The big problem however is the close proximity to the railway. We stayed in room 633 and the racket from the trains continued until nearly 2am with the noise starting again at around 8.30am. Totally awful nights sleep and tbh ruined our short break in Dublin.",1,2017,12,17
219,fab lunch,"had lunch here this week it was excellent and the staff where so friendly keith was looking after us and couldnt of been better very attentive service .
We both had the special of the day which was delious",5,2017,12,15
219,Didn't get a wink of sleep,"Stayed here with my husband and parents in Dec 2017. Walked in and thought the hotel was beautiful. We apparently though, were put in the ""old"" section of the hotel. Fine...wasn't going to be super picky since we did this on a groupon. But then we go to the room. No sooner did we put our bags down that the drilling started right next to our room. Wanted to take a nap after traveling all day and went to call the front desk and the phone wasn't working. We went out to eat instead and the drilling stopped by the time we got back. But ALL night....people slamming their doors, talking VERY loudly in the hallways in front of our doors. This went on the entire 4 days we were there. Could hear everything between the walls, people talking, showering, everything. I'm hoping their construction will alleviate this problem. Also our room was on the side of an alley. Which nightly we could hear garbage trucks, yelling, fighting and screaming.The rooms themselves were average. Beds weren't very comfortable. The included breakfast was actually pretty decent. Lots of choices with eggs, hash browns, sausage, bacon, breads, juices, cereals. This we enjoyed. Hotel is convenient to the tram and had a lot of local pubs near by and about a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar. Wouldn't stay here again though.",2,2017,12,14
219,Visit to hotel bar,Really nice bar with great food and reasonably priced. The neighbourhood is a bit dodgy and you wouldn‚Äôt be hanging around locally but it is well served by all transport links so easy to get to and near all the main attractions of the city. Would certainly recommend it for drinks and/or food with friend or family.,5,2017,12,13
219,good stay in city,"This hotel is on the end of the street and the rooms are back from the front of the building, separated by a small bridge.  Room was quiet and modern with large windows overlooking a green space.  Bathroom was very modern.  There is a large breakfast room downstairs with lots of selection, including the typical large English breakfast.",4,2017,12,12
219,Excellent stay,"Really comfortable beds, very hi-tech. Staff very helpful. On screen ordering of a variety of pillows and toiletries. Room service reasonable price and excellent service. The room was so comfortable that we did not want to move out to go on our booked excursion, although a pleasure to come back to the room after a day sight-seeing. Free snacks in room mini-bar including chocolate, crisps and biscuits as well as a coffee machine and free bottled water.
Hotel definitely 4 star with excellent amenities. The Club lounge was a bonus with 24/7 coffee machine, water and snacks. Breakfast a little expensive ‚Ç¨16, but lots of choice, Continental also on offer for ‚Ç¨11. 
We will be going back, one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in for a reasonable price.
Excellent transport links, close to station, 747 bus outside the airport door directly to within a 1 minute walk of the hotel. Good local bus service to all tourist attractions with many within walking distance. Also many places to eat and have coffee nearby.",5,2017,12,05
219,Holiday in Dublin: wow!,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 days. We really recommend it because the bed was very big, the room was clean and with all comforts. They also provide soap, shampoo, body lotion...if you want to stay for a short time. It's very close to the centre on foot and with means of transportation. In fact, it's near the station and this can be a little noisy for someone. It was a little bit but maybe you can ask for a more silent room. Staff was very kind and helpful. I'll come again:). Thank you for everything.",5,2017,12,05
219,Weekend away with friends,Stayed here four years ago and decided to go back again. Lots of modernisation done and it is very impressive indeed. Staff are very polite and very helpful. We decided travel breakfast here as well and the choices are wonderful from whatever you desire and very good quality indeed. Wonderful bar and restaurant which is always busy and that speaks volumes. We wouldn't stay anywhere else when we visit Dublin. Many thanks for a fabulous time.,5,2017,12,04
219,Nice hotel in sketchy neighborhood,"We stayed here as part of a Globus tour.  The lobby, restaurant and rooms were fine.
The neighborhood is not fabulous but we really had no trouble walking in the area.  It was really on the fringe of a less desirable area.
The location was within walking distance of the Irish History Center, the river, downtown and Temple Bar.  We would stay here again.",4,2017,12,03
219,Hit or miss,"Very confused by this hotel as the website photos imply a refurbishment which is only the case on certain floors, the other floors and rooms are very dated and quite basic. When walking into reception it was clear that in a few years the hotel will be very nice as the restaurant and reception are well donee the. The gym was also dated and not really fit for use plus it looked into the breakfast room through glass doors and you could smell cooked breakfast which doesn‚Äôt make for a good workout.
I was also confused that the other hotel ‚ÄúThe Address‚Äù is in the same building but a higher standard of hotel, this was not clear until checking in and being told I was unable to upgrade. At check out there was no help getting a taxi and we were basically thrown out into the rain on the street which wasn‚Äôt the best end to the stay.
Not in the best area of town and not value for money until it is fully refurbished. ",2,2017,12,02
219,Clean but noisy.,Located right across the road from Connelly train station.Spotlessly clean room and friendly reception staff.Excellent room service and great on site restaurant.Only issue I had was the constant noise from the hallway door banging closed every morning from around 6am onwards to around 10h30 am..if your wanting a sleep in forget it(in fairness it could just have been my room).Otherwise I would recommend the North Star and stay again..but request a quiet room away from hallway door.,4,2017,12,01
219,Fantastic ,"Me and my partner have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel and from the moment we arrived we were happy with everything.

We turned up at 11:30am expecting to wait until 2pm to check in, but our room was ready for us which surprised us. The reception staff where wonderful and polite! They greeted us with a smile and answered all our questions and provided us with maps of Dublin so we can find our way around.

Our room was spacious (210) and clean with a huge comfortable bed. The housekeeping team had done a wonderful job with it. The only downside (which is completely beyond the hotel staff's power) was the traintrack right outside our window, but we played a game of waving at the trains when they passed us. But that is the only thing I can fault. Once the windows where closed, there was only a slight rumble from the passing trains, which didn't bother us. 

There's nothing I can fault with the hotel itself! 

The restaurant was nice too! Lovely decor and lovely food and wonderful staff! Nice little heated beer garden out the back where you can relax. Our waitress was very polite and friendly.

We are already planning our next stay here! ",5,2017,11,29
219,Not too shabby,"Overall, the hotel was great. The staff was kind. I wish they would have informed us on how to use the electricity in the room. In addition, the hotel food was great. However, the TV only had like 5 channels, but then again we did not come to Dublin to watch TV.",4,2017,11,27
219,Cannot fault this at all - and don't worry about the trains nearby!!,"Excellent hotel, with an excellent location - the trains at Connelly Station opposite were rarely heard and when they were there was so little noise you had to strain to actually hear them!

Apparently this hotel only opened in early 2017, so all is presently pristine and new. That includes the electricals - nice and techy switches for everything in the room (including the curtains), but it's not complicated.

As much as I enjoyed the room and its technical wizadry, if there was one aspect I could criticise it is the in-room safe - with all the lights etc in the room, why not install one in the safe? It's in a place that can be quite gloomy (mmod lighting, I mean!!) and you need to make sure you look carefully inside and don't leave anything behind.",5,2017,11,25
219,Central Comfort,"I stayed in this hotel last week and found it to be lovely, good room, clean, very comfortable and very good service.

I asked for a central hotel that I could use as a base, to walk everywhere in the in the City and it was perfect for this.

All the staff were very helpful and ready to help.",5,2017,11,22
219,"Nice hotel, disappointed staff","I went to the north star during a business trip in november 2017.
I was really happy to find a nice hotel in Dublin, close to the center, and with really spacious and comfortable rooms. Its one of the best price/quality deals i ve seen in Dublin and i really like the deco of the building.
Nevertheless, i was extremely disappointed by the rudeness of the staff in the breakfast room (breakfast being by the way expensive and definitely not good). I felt disrespected and it ruined my stay. ",3,2017,11,22
219,Smart stay,We had a great time at The Address ‚Äî the hotel is beautifully designed and is located within walking distance from the city centre. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The highlight of our stay at the hotel was our room - it felt super smart and like a truly modern hotel. The immediate area around the hotel feels quite run down which is why this isn‚Äôt 5/5. But this hotel is fantastic value for money! ,4,2017,11,20
219,Clean convenient Hotel,I have stayed in the North Star Hotel twice and both times I've enjoyed my visit and the hospitality of the friendly staff.  The rooms are excellent - we stayed in the newly refurbished room 242 this time.  The bar and restaurant area is very stylish and the service is prompt and polite. I'll mention Keith here as he is a typical Dub with plenty of banter and craic but still very professional and courteous.  The food is delicious and not over expensive as is the pricing of the beers and spirits.  The Hotel is located very conveniently to Connolly Station and also within easy walking distance of Busarus and several private coach stops.  I see some people have complained of noise levels from the trains passing close by - I had no problem with any noise issues - I'd suggest looking for a room on the street side of the Hotel.  I think the ongoing renovations will address this problem in the future.  I'll return here again - ideal for attending gigs in the 3Arena,5,2017,11,18
219,Looks good but noisy rooms,"We were initially given a room in the original building but this was directly opposite the train line and at 1 o/clock am when a freight train passed by I requested a move.  The next room was directly above the reception so there was noise from below and also the busy road outside.  Our third night we were moved to another room in the tower block of rooms at the back accessed through the railway arch incorporated into the hotel reception (which was very stylish along with the bar) because the lock on our door broke.  The third room was smaller than the other two and although stylish it was again noisy. At all times the hotel staff were friendly accommodating and helpful.  Unfortunately it is in busy location and surrounded by trainlines, roads, offices and residential flats.",3,2017,11,16
219,Hotel from hell,"I don‚Äôt know about North Star but this awful hotel in an awful area would be more suitably named the no star. At least that name would give the traveller some idea of the accommodation quality. I can only imagine this place is used as a social housing queue. Screaming kids run up and down the corridors. On the first night the management had to be called to one guy screaming and singing at the top of his voice until gone midnight. It must have been drugs or mental health related. As I write this, the room next door has been occupied by a family with screaming kids howling above the decibel threshold of pain. The hotel staff seem to accept this abhorrent treatment of their guests quite readily. Breakfast is only fit as pig swill. Several outings by the same muesli ensure a cardboard chewing experience in a basement restaurant where there is no mobile phone signal. Then there is the non working card keys and the ridiculous slow lift where the ground floor is not reception but reception is on the ground floor. Errrr what? Yep you heard me right. Night time entertainment can be had by strolling through the row of shops watching juvenile shop lifters being removed by shop staff. Choose another hotel!",1,2017,11,15
219,Our visit to Dublin,"Excellent hotel with excellent facilities staff really friendly and helpful it's been updated since last year,the food was great and service was really good,rooms Have everything you need would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,11,15
219,North Star Dublin,"Older part of the hotel is dated, new part of the hotel is spectacular. Restaurant is great place to eat and has a good variety. All the staff are always helpful, the hotel is central and well located for night life.",4,2017,11,15
219,Good Value and Easy Access,The location is fairly convenient to everything on the near north side and near south side of the city center. We walked to tour bus stops and to the hop-on/off busses as well as walked to shops and restaurants.  The desk staff was very friendly and helpful to lock up our luggage until check-in time.  The room and bath for 4 was large in comparison to England and France. The rooms and public spaces are clean and modern. The food services are higher class.  This was a good experience and would like to visit again.,5,2017,11,13
219,"Good, but not great","We stayed at the North Star for a long weekend during an international rugby game.
From the outside, the hotel does not look like much.  And being near the train station does not help matters.
Stepping inside, it's easy to see that they try hard, really hard.  Nice furnishings, a concierge, and a friendly-looking pub adjoin the restaurant.  There is also a coffee shop which serves pretty good espresso-based coffees during the day.  There's also an ""executive lounge"" on the 7th floor.  That was more than I expected for a four star hotel.
You can see that they are busy with renovations, so perhaps the hotel is a work in progress.
I found, though, that there were a few edges that were a little rough.  For example, the breakfast room takes one back several decades - with the food and decor options.
We found the rooms to be weakly insulated so one hears all the traffic outside the room.  It would also be nice to have soap instead of that dispenser affixed to the wall.  During our stay, the elevators did not work properly - if you stopped on an intermediate floor, then the lift reversed direction.  That resulted in a few ""up and down"" trips.
By the way, the gym is positively ancient.  Rather go for a run along the river.",4,2017,11,12
219,High tech hotel,The room was a good size and live the high tech features. Air con made it stuffy and we had club lounge access but disappointed at what was available - only tea coffee water and biscuits - would have been lovely to have canap√©s and breakfast included in this option,4,2017,11,12
219,Excellent hotel!! You're gonna want to stay here!,"At first I was a bit skeptical cause of its proximity to the train rail and the possibility of high noises at night. But the price was fair.  Luckily, nothing to worry about!  Our room was right in front of it and, while you do tell when the train passes by, it is totally bearable (sometimes you wouldn't realize it!), it's not really a problem and I believe it stops at night... not once did it wake us up. Perhaps cause the beds are way too comfortable?!  The hotel is brand new and very high tech.   Phil, the kind young man who brought our luggage up to the room was kind enough to go through all the ""techy"" details with us. Very clean place and atmosphere. Close to town and (a nice 10 min. walk or so).  Also, very close to the train station.  The cherry on top: they were kind enough to have a room ready upon arrival at mid morning, which after traveling for nearly 12 hours was certainly most welcome!   TIP:  When coming from DUB, take the Airlink 747 and get off at the Talbot street stop. The hotel is about 5 mins. from there. Heading back, walk about 7 mins to the Bus√°ras station and take either the Airling 747 or 757.",5,2017,11,12
219,"Good, not fantastic","location is very central, close to the Connolly station, on the path of the buses from the airport. No fancy view, just the busy Amiens street. the hotel is at the back, so you don't hear trains nor traffic. rooms/bathrooms on the 3rd floor are reasonably clean, but could deserve a renovation. the price is good, the service & food at the connected pub is very good. The internet on the 3rd floor was poor. Convenient and not too expensive, but not fantastic.",3,2017,11,09
219,Stay experince was good but our Jacket Left in Hotel and staff mentioning not found anywhere by Housekeeping,"Stay experience was nice but Hotel is not trustworthy, things are not safe. We left our Jacket in Hotel by mistake and been trying to chase them for it. Everyone from staff is mentioning that no Jacket found anywhere in Hotel premises which is really surprising. Things within the hotel can be lost anytime and people there are not really bothered about customers belongings being such a nice reputed Hotel.",3,2017,11,09
219,One night stay at the North Star hotel,"Really great experience at the North Star Hotel, the room was fantastic and the staff were very helpful. There was slight noise from the trains, but overall not an inconvenience. We were attending a concert at the 3 arena so the location was very convenient.  Also a very convenient walk to the city center and Bus Aras. It was excellent value for money, would definitely recommend to others looking for a city break for leisure.",4,2017,11,09
219,Perfect,"this was my first trip to Dublin, we went to see Jools Holland at the 3 Arena, and this hotel was right in the middle of everything, turn right and right again for O'Connell street/Temple Bar/Grafton Street, Turn right then straight ahead till the river then turn left for a 20 min stroll to the 3 arena, so it really is central for everything. the breakfast has everything you could want and the room was very comfortable, the staff very polite & helpful would definitely stay here again",5,2017,11,07
219,Great Location very comfortable Hotel,"This hotels refurbishment had been excellent. Rooms are fab ... didnt really want to leave the room and the location is great just beside Connolly station , some complaints about the train noise but I found it ok as tbh you are beside a train station . Staff really efficient , food in the bar was second to none . We stayed for a concert in the 3 arena and we just jumped on the Luas close by. After the concert we had a couple fo drinks in the bar .. no residents facility for a late drink apart from your room that is the only downside as it would be nice to continue to people watch a while longer ... but would 100% recommend and will stay again .",4,2017,11,07
219,OK but Expensive!,"Stayed at the North Star Hotel  for two days last weekend.

The hotel and rooms are nice but the noise from the trains rumbling over the hotel and the very loud humming of something outside our window made it hard to sleep.

Don't eat in the restaurant as it is poor quality and expensive.

First night I had ribs and these were OK but were just the boil in the bag variety nothing special. Second night I had a steak, asked for medium rare but got a watery rare steak with no texture at all for 25euros, I left half of it!

OK as a base but still a mile walk to town centre.",3,2017,11,07
219,Pleasantly surprised ,"Had a delicious lunch in the North Star. It has had a make over and looks fantastic! The staff are very nice and welcoming and the food was really tasty. I ordered the falafel burger(plain) but it came with the fillings. Each member of staff were so apologetic about it and to apologise, they gave me a free cup of coffee. This was so nice of them and they‚Äôll definitely see me returning because of that great customer service! ",5,2017,11,06
219,First stay of our trip to Ireland,"This was a great location for walking to O'Connell Street, Temple Bar district a bit of a walk to Viking/Medieval but all in decent walking times.  Close to loads of things to do, as well as lots of pubs in the area.  Rooms were fine, clean and staff was very very helpful.  Be prepared for a bit of a walk to the parking.  Drop your bags off at the hotel first.  24 hour parking was up the street on Connolly  bit sketchy -wouldn't want to walk it at night.",4,2017,11,06
219,NIce stay,"Made this my homebase during my Dublin vacation this year. Pretty new place and therefore in great shape. Everything in the room seems to work electronically. The proximity to the tramline can be bothersome. OK, it is quiet during the night - but it was my alarm clock every morning... HInt to the hotel: Get yourself introduced to the Dublin taxi driver population - during almost a full week, none of the cab drivers even heard about a hotel called ""The address""...",4,2017,11,04
219,Good Location.  Be aware you need to be tolerant of street people and their activities.,"Great location to walk to if you are using bus shuttle from airport.  3 min.  From bus stop.  Departing about 5-8 min to bus stop.  Arriving & departing during daylight is a good idea.  I am not saying it is not safe.  We saw police presence and intervention a couple of times.  

You can easily walk to centre of Dublin.  Catch the Hop on hop off buses. Walk to shopping areas and different off the beaten path areas.  I did this on my own.  Also with our 94 year old friend. 

Concierges are a bit of a joke.  Need to look most everything we ask about up.  Never able to actually give us details.  But give them a B for effort.  

Rooms do not have soundproof.  We were in a room and it was stuffy.  Needed window open.  Right by garbage pickup. 2nd floor. Noisy from that.  Last night at hotel.  Doors slamming.  Yelling into wee hours.  Was tough to get up at 5 am after falling asleep at 4. 

The staff are yes people.  Not really caring. Got the feeling this place is a money maker.  

The restaurant is not worth the money.  Go to other places where you will get the feeling of good Irish service.   Do you get it.  I gave a 3.  This is very generous.  Wheelchair access to a room would be difficult. 

Our triple room was tight.  

I would not stay here again.",3,2017,11,03
219,Disappointing,"We stayed here for my birthday in October, there were 10 of us in our party. The photos of the rooms looked rather misleading as we were expecting a modern room however when we arrived the room was very outdated. Our room was on the ground floor and was therefore facing the pavement outside. The room was very warm and the aircon was not working so we had to open our window meaning that everybody walking past could look in to our room. We also did not feel happy leaving the window open in the night so it was very uncomfortable. Pillows not particularly comfortable.

The restaurant in the hotel was very nice, we didn't eat there but we stayed for drinks. Staff very nice. 

Reception were not particular welcoming when we arrived. Just asked for payment straight away and passed our key cards to us. 

Location was not great. A good 15 minute walk to Temple Bar. Two members of our party found a much better hotel located much closer and cheaper. 

Wouldn't stay here again there are better choices.",2,2017,11,02
219,Well located,"We stayed in this hotel in October 2017 and it was nicely located to all the attractions and things we could walk to.  The only downside to this hotel his that it didn't have parking.  We parked at a public lot across the street and down a bit.  We were late getting to our car the next day and had a clamp on the car, which cost us $120 Euro to get it off.  It didn't ruin our trip, but would have been nice to have some kind of pass or something from the hotel.  The rooms are on the smaller side, but were clean and well kept.  We liked the bar at the hotel,which was McGettigan's.",4,2017,10,30
219,"Very Comfortable, Close to Everything & Excellent Breakfasts!","Stayed for two days and nights while visiting Dublin with my adult daughter. We found the hotel quiet, comfortable, within easy walking distance of most attractions, City Centre and Temple Bar area. We parked our car at check-in and never moved it until we ended our stay. I will recommend The North Star to friends and will absolutely return for my next Dublin visit.",5,2017,10,30
219,"Outstanding, cant wait to return","We were in a ""club"" room in the Address part of the building and it was out of this world.  All high tech and tastefully decorated.  Even though it was next to the train line into Connolly we were rarely aware of the trains passing. The sink in the bathroom was a little low and the towel rail was in an awkward position but that was nothing to complain about really.  We found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful.  The rate included breakfast of which there was a good selection of choices which included some gluten free. The hotel is in a great location for getting from the Airport (747 bus) and the luas trams stop close by for easy access to the rest of the city. We bought a visitors Leap card at the airport and really got our moneys worth over the weekend. We were so impressed by the hotel that we will definitely consider it again on our next visit to Dublin",5,2017,10,30
219,BAD EVERYTHING,"Allow me to say that I have never written a bad review for anything, even the bad hotel stays I've had. Having said that I would really NOT recommend this hotel, unless you are a local in town for a business meeting that is close by. If you are renting a car or planning to get sleep, do not stay here. 

There is a side of the hotel that faces the train tracks (the hotel is across the street from a train station). In addition to this the hotel is undergoing a renovation or construction on that same side. I used to work in hotels for years and usually, if it is not possible to place guests on the non-noisy side, as a courtesy, the staff mentions that there are railroad tracks, a road, construction, etc. that may be noisy to warn guests before they get to their room. Needless to say, this was not done. Our room was on the side of the railroad/construction side and sleeping and/or watching TV was challenging. Speaking of the TV, it's tiny and not visible from the opposite side of the room.

The hotel staff were more interested in talking to each other than the guests. They were not welcoming nor forthcoming with basic information about the city transportation, or tours. The concierge was the only person who was absolutely wonderful.

Finally, if you are driving, they do not offer parking, which is not a big deal as Dublin is a busy city with little space. However, they will tell you that there is paid parking available ""across the street"". Not true. The parking is not ""across the street"", it is about 3 - 4 blocks away, costs 10 euro a day and the walk back to the hotel from the paid parking is scary.",2,2017,10,29
219,Luxurious stay in city centre hotel,We had an amazing stay in the north star hotel. Firstly the suite we stayed in was spotlessly clean and was so bright and spacious. The hotel is right beside Connolly train station in the city centre and is near a very handy taxi rank. The staff are very friendly and attentive and the breakfast was delicious with a huge choice. A must stay if you are in this part of the city.,5,2017,10,28
219,Great,"Nice clean rooms 
very big in size. 
No bath 
great staff 
parking close by 
very quite 
Rooms to hot 
Bar takes english money and changes it but not at the best rate 

Would recommend 

Good fast free WiFi 
Very close to ferry 
",5,2017,10,28
219,Awesome!!,"Terrific hotel and staff! I was put up in brand new and modern wing. Even though it's near the tram it stops running at night so you don't hear it. 
Location is fantastic within walking distance of many attractions.
Staff was very good but especially the professional concierge Martin. Amazing guy!!
Well worth it!",5,2017,10,28
219,Very fine hotel,"For the first time here in Dublin I enjoyed a wonderful time staying in the hotel.
The hotel suggests big, clean and comfortable rooms.
The hotel is located just a few blocks from the Main Street, so its very easy.
I must admit that I didn‚Äôt impressed by the breakfast. Except the healthy area, the warm dishes was too oily and uncooked for me. So frankly, most of the days I used to eat from the healthy area. 
Except that I think is a very good hotel.",4,2017,10,27
219,"Pleasant hotel, great location but even better when fully renovated","Smart appearance from the outside and trendy reception area welcomes you to this well located hotel.

We were in a suite which was ample in size and comfortable although a little tired. The renovation that is taking place, when finished, will be stunning. 

Breakfast was worth including and the selection of cold and hot choices was good. 

Hotel bar and restaurant was useful after sightseeing all day. Food was good and the chowder was well liked by my friend. Ambience was warm and welcoming.

Would recommend this hotel.",4,2017,10,26
219,"Bad service , bad stay! ","Such a pity because on first arrival this hotel is wonderful when you arrive inside as the decor is beautiful,  raising your expectations immediately. That's where it stops. The reception desk were brusque , rude, unwelcoming and took all the money for my stay up front ( did they know I would consider checking out the next day instead of the full stay?) and didn't offer any help to my room with luggage which I was struggling with and had to fund the lifts alone. 
The room was stunning and looked very comfortable with nice facilities but no door lock or simple things like how to contact reception at breakfast times or how to stop all the lights coming on every time you put your feet outside the covers or you went to the bathroom in the night ( they called it a ""smart""  room- not that smart huh )! 
Time spent in the room later revealed it was also situated over a railway line with the train stopping by outside your window so passengers could see straight in; you had to have the curtains closed all the time for privacy. In the bedroom the headboard rumbled by my head when the train passed every three minutes from 6am til late at night. This was the new part of the hotel called The Address - you can say that again ! I was shattered when  left !!
The reception staff were not interested when I complained. The Croatian man in reception whose name began with a J was the worst; Hostile , argumentative cold and unhelpful. Why was he working in that role if he clearly hated it so much? I have never ever had that reception before and travel twice per week. 
The restaurant McCorrigans  serves great food and great atmosphere which is great as you can enjoy as service very slow due to too few staff so on all occasions a long wait to get served.(40 minutes on one occasion ) Amazing coffee though. 
When I checked out we closed the bill. They handed my credit card back then walked off. No enquiry to my stay , comfort wishing me a good day or did I need a taxi anywhere so I had to struggle through the doors with luggage to try and flag one outside. If they had asked they would have found all of the above out. 
So to surmise : Wonderful rooms , premier executive lounge on the top floors serving continental breakfast , good restaurant on site with good chefs to trade in with bad service , no welcome , noisy room over busy railway line so no sleep and no customer service hardly at all ? Never again for me which is such a pity to be in beautiful surroundings of which the beauty was only skin deep! ",2,2017,10,22
219,"THANK YOU, RHONA AND STAFF!","Many thanks to Rhona, the manager, and her staff for a lovely stay at the North Star.   Uri was very helpful, and oriented us in getting around.The hotel itself was well maintained, with a great restaurant.  

Most importantly, Rhona, the manager, took great care in seeing that all guests were advised of the situation with Hurricane Ophelia an d the safety precautions the hotel was taking.  Additionally, the staff went above and beyond to make guests comfortable who had their travel and touring plans upended. 

Great job.  Many thanks.",5,2017,10,21
219,Nice hotel-Maintenance not so good,"I booked 7 nights at the North Star. The hotel is very nice. I love that they kept the original arch for the train tracks above and that you can hear the trains going over whilst in the lobby. Very neat. My problem rests with the maintenance in the rooms. My phone in the room didn't work the first two nights. Upon leaving the hotel the first morning, I asked the front desk clerk to have it checked out. I returned to the room and we finally had dial tone. I asked for a wake up call for the next morning and while I'm certain that they did make the call, the phone did not ring at the time requested. Thankfully we were already awake. I advised the desk clerk and he said that he would check it again. The next morning, the phone did ring for the wake up. My next issue is the A/C. The first three nights th A/C worked wonderfully, but on the 4th night the room was very warm. I asked the front desk at 6:30 am to check it out because we basically roasted and as a result tossed and turned all night. We finally had to open the sliding glass door to aid in cooling the room off a bit although this wasn't very helpful either. We returned to the room at 8:30 pm and it was still very warm. Called the front desk, the clerk said that he would send a colleague up, that was a half hour ago. The hotel itself is very lovely, but maintenance needs an overhaul. If I have to sleep in a hot room again tonight, I'm going to be extremely upset.",3,2017,10,20
219,Bright city stopover,"We staid one night on our way to Wexford.  The hotel is opposite the entrance to Connolly rail station and less than a minute from the airport bus stop. So very convenient. From outside, I wondered if we made the right choice.  Inside was very different, very bright, clean and modern.  The reception staff could not be more helpful and this was the same for the breakfast staff.  We had an executive room. It was lovely, great toiletries and lovely coffee machine in the room.  Free WiFi that works as well. The room was warm.  Breakfast was a buffet all good quality. The hotel has a good restaurant and cafe. I will definitely stay here again when I come to Dublin next. On the booking site, I received a 20% reduction for the room. I am never sure if these are real, but the person checking in next to me was charged considerably more , so feel more confident in reduced price. ",4,2017,10,20
219,Always a wonderful stay ,I‚Äôve stayed here 3 times now and I‚Äôve never had anything negative to say. In the past year the hotel has also been renovated and is now looks even more modern. The only downside for some people may be the train tracks running near the building but this personally wasn‚Äôt an issue. ,5,2017,10,19
219,Ideal City Centre at a reasonable price,We started trip to Ireland 10 days earlier in Dublin at a hotel that was not conveniently located or even very nice.  Our experience here was very different in a most positive way.  The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful and the location was ideal.  I saw some complaints about a busy street and train noise - you are staying in the city next to the train station (reception is literally under the tracks) this should be expected.  This is also centrally located which was a pleasant change from our other hotel.  Sadly we arrived in Dublin the night before Hurricane Ophelia and the entire country was being closed so we couldn‚Äôt wander much.  We spent a lot more time in the hotel lounge and bar than most travelers but as you couldn‚Äôt leave what else were we to do?  Given that because of the storm they were very busy and short staffed they did an amazing job.  My only real complaint was the bathroom in our room the door didn‚Äôt stay closed unless locked and the lock didn‚Äôt always work given that they are renovating I suspect this will be resolved and would recommend you stay here.,4,2017,10,18
219,Best hotel ,"We spent 4 nights in the beautifully renovated ‚ÄúThe Address‚Äù section of this hotel. We have travelled frequently all over Europe and I can honestly say this is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The location right across from the train station is ideal for exploring the city or taking the Dart line to the suburbs. The airport express bus is two blocks away. 
King room was bright and spacious. Bathroom was enormous by European standards. All controls for the room were electronic including the curtains! On most days the room was made up while we had breakfast! Speaking of breakfast the buffet which was included in our room price, was well stocked with all the makings of a full Irish breakfast and then some. Fastest toaster I have ever experienced at any hotel. 
All the staff that we encountered were extremely friendly helpful and efficient. We had trouble getting through to a restaurant for dinner reservations but the front desk staff came through for us and we had a lovely dinner at Matt the Thresher. We had dinner twice at the hotel restaurant McGettigans. Service was prompt and friendly, food delicious. We were there the night of the hurricane in Dublin when the rest of the city was shut down they managed to feed their guests despite many of the staff unable to get in because public transport was shut down. Management staff were there in the restaurant helping out including the owner Mr McGettigan ! There are a lot of exclamation marks in this review because that‚Äôs how we felt about this hotel. Thank you Mr McGettigan, your staff is doing a very fine job indeed!",5,2017,10,18
219,Nice Spot,"Nice hotel, lovely reception. Bar area busy with good food! Central location right beside connolly station and not far from O‚ÄôConnell street. Room was very warm but a fan was provided. The area between the hotel and Croke Park is rough in parts and if you look up google maps of this area and also look up the recent Dublin gang problems on google you will find a few familiar street names. All in all pretty nice place but a little over priced for a 3.5 or 4* service/hotel but then again Dublin is becoming an extremely expensive city.",3,2017,10,17
219,Great location.  Disappointing service. ,"Our initial impression was good the reception was modern and looked nice and the location was good. However, after paying ‚Ç¨150 per night we were very disappointed with our room. Firstly the heat was very uncomfortable and there was no air con available, having the window open was also an issue as there was construction going on through the day. We were also worried at the privacy of the room as there was plenty of foot traffic past our window, to say it is allegedly a 4 star hotel the room was extremely dated and very overvalued, the phone in the room didnt work. The images on their website did not match what was provided. When I raised the issues to the staff he couldn't care less what i had to say he just upgraded the room and hushed me away. I WILL NOTE that the upgraded room was far better, more modern and had a good level of noise and facilities. I will also say that the bell boy who took us to our rooms and helped with the bags was fantastic and couldn't of been nicer. In total though the overvalued price and poor level of service means that I would likely not return. ",3,2017,10,17
219,Average,"The North Star Hotel is conveniently located near an incoming airport bus stop and across the street from the Connolly train station.  However, the convenient location is a trade-off for the creepy neighborhood around the corner from the hotel.  As soon as we exited the bus from the airport at around 10 a.m., a pushy inebriated older male standing outside of a bar approached us and wouldn‚Äôt leave us alone until we crossed the street.

At the hotel, we were checked in by a pleasant gentleman, and our spacious room was ready when we arrived.  Unfortunately, our room was located very close to a parking lot, where a gigantic dumpster was being noisily loaded late into the evening.  Also, from our room we could see and hear trains from early morning to late evening.  Another con is that breakfast wasn‚Äôt included in our rate.",3,2017,10,12
219,Nice Stay,Lovely atmospheric hotel Good location Really nice staff Restaurant was good Bar staff were very friendly Room was good with everything we needed We stayed in room 156 and it was EXTREMELY noisy with people coming in at night and going out in the morning going along the corridor and up in the lift This was the only issue we had and would stay again but would ask for a quieter room,4,2017,10,11
219,"We wanted to love it, but wouldn't stay again","Unfortunately, this hotel is not one we would ever book again. Upon check-in, we opened the door to the room and were greeted by about 4 or 5 flies, flying around the room! We tried to settle in, but there were also very small bugs in the bathroom. We let the front desk know and asked if our room could be changed. We went to lunch. After getting back, we were told our room wouldn't be changed but that the flies had been taken care of. There were no more flies in the room when we got back. 

The parking was also an issue. There was no informtion on the website so we were unaware all parking was off-site and that there were no deals with nearby lots/garages. We found a parking lot that was a bit expensive, but when we asked the woman at check-in for other options she said that we were ""safer"" where we were because parking at the nearby train station wasn't the safest option for our rental car - yikes! 

We only stayed one night, but this wouldn't be my pick to stay when visiting beautiful downtown Dublin again.",2,2017,10,10
219,Amazing new rooms <3,"We have stayed in the North Star Hotel several times over the past two years and decided to stay in the Address for my partners birthday this time round. The rooms are so high tech and are just beautiful. The staff amazing as always and the new lounge is superb, the heaters make such a difference and the view incredible. Room 739 is highly recommended, the view is gorgeous and really great, the water was an issue in the shower/bath but new room so im sure it will be fixed. The food was great, room service was quick and i cannot thank kieron at the conceirge enough for helping me with my partners birthday surprise. Overall amazing as always and we will be back again in the new year :)",5,2017,10,10
219,"Great hotel, good location to Dublin Center!","We changed our plans while in Dublin and decided to stay at The North Star Hotel.   When we got there we were placed in a room at The Address which is the updated part of the hotel, really separate.   We were very happy we did because we had read several reviews on Trip Advisor concerning The North Star's remodeling was still in progress.   Even though this hotel was a bit pricier than the other hotels we had stayed in Dublin, the room was new, modern and very nice.   Our WIFI worked perfectly in our room.   However, we could not get WIFI to work while in the lobby.  We were located on the 5th floor which was only 2 floors higher than the train which could be noisy with squeaking brakes at times.   Our room was a corner suite above where people were partying and it was quite noisy until about 1:30 in the morning on a Thursday night.  It rained on Friday night and was much quieter.  It was also very nice they had complimentary chocolate and chips in the refrigerator in the room.    They also have a room on the 7th floor where we were told you can get water, tea, coffee and biscuits 24/7.   However, this was not always stocked.  They offer other food up there for breakfast but make sure you do not have any unless you are wiling to be charged extra.  The location (other than near the train) is an easy walk to Talbot and O'Connell street and is near some very good pubs.",4,2017,10,09
219,Finishing up our vacation with a few extra days in Dublin,We stayed our last two nights at The Address at Dublin1. The rooms are very modern everything done with a touch of a button. Our room was a good size and clean. Had everything we needed. We were right next to the Dart. The trains were within 50 feet of our room. I didn't mind this at all.  ,4,2017,10,08
219,Lovely Room,"This was a beautiful place to stay! We arrived around 10am and left our luggage at the front desk. Returned to check-in around 4pm. Our room was very nice and with a great view! It was very warm when we got in, but once we got the AC pumping (and left it on) it was nice and cool for the night. Granted this was our first day in Ireland, after our 8 hour flight with no sleep so we probably wouldn't anything awful unless it was VERY OBVIOUS. The bathroom was clean and water pressure (rain fall shower head) was AMAZING. We did have a balcony but it was connected to rooms on either side, so didn't spend any time out there. The concierge was friendly and helpful, directing us to breakfast locations and answering our questions. We did not have the hotel breakfast, so no comment there. The only thing to note was that standing in the lobby, you could hear the train(?) going nearby (sounded like next door/overhead). . but in our room we couldn't hear it at all. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,10,07
219,Excellent visit but still room for improvement,"
We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the North Star. We were greeted by kind reception staff who checked us in and told us they had given us a complimentary upgrade. When we arrived at our room we were very pleasantly surprised by the immaculate room and super king size bed. Even though the room was clean maintenance was needed, lights not working in bathroom, draw jammed out of the dresser, rip in the curtain. Even with these minor faults we were more than impressed with our room and the service we received! We have not given the full 5 stars due to the heat in our room, not even at night, all day! There was heating with an adjustable heat however this didn't adjust to fan or air con. The room was unbearable hot and as we had a sliding door out to a balcony there were no windows. On the last night we had to sleep with the balcony door open which was a little unsettling but it was the only compromise! The concierge Martin and all the bar staff were very kind, helpful and attended to our needs. Thanks to all the staff for making our first visit to Dublin memorable!  ",4,2017,10,06
219,Nice hotel with a convenient location,"My boyfriend and I recently booked the North Star Hotel for a 1 night stay in Dublin.  We arrived early from the airport and were told that our room was ready right away!  We were pleasantly surprised to be put up in the newly renovated hotel, The Address.  The room was very comfortable with modern technological updates.  The rain shower was wonderful with excellent water pressure.  We took a nice walk around Dublin to River Liffey and the Temple Bar area which was about 25 minutes away.  The concierge was very helpful giving us a wonderful recommendation for dinner at a restaurant close to the hotel.  We were happy with our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2017,10,06
219,I like this hotel.  It suits what I need for Business visits,"Working in Dublin for several weeks, I tried several hotels around the City.  The North Star is my favorite, because it is close to IFSC where I needed to be, good quality, clean tidy and has a well equipped Gym.  I stayed in a variety of rooms from Ground floor to Top floor.  ground floor room was a bit warm and Air con struggled to maintain temperature.  Top floor room was nice, with balcony.  The lifts, however, could be a challenge in the mornings.  With lots of people checking out, the lifts were busy, but had a tendency to lose their way!  you could go from 7th floor down to say 4th floor, then it gets called higher up and go back up again!
The Gym is very well equipped for a Hotel, 3 treadmills, 3 bikes, cross trainer, rowing machine plus free weights and resistance machines.  Not busy either.
The restaurant attached, McGettigans is excellent.  the food is very good.  good choice, well prepared and delivered, good portions but not too much, so you are full but not stuffed!  Staff are great.  typically irish, fun and funny.  good company.",4,2017,10,05
219,"Great food, convenient location","I wanted somewhere convenient to the 3 arena for a concert i was going to and couldn't have found a better location.  I arrived at midday and received a warm welcome from the staff at reception. I was surprised to find my room was ready for me to check-in immediately  The decor of the entire hotel is stunning and suits a city centre vibe.  The rooms were spotlessly clean with all the mod cons necessary for a comfortable stay, there was also bottled water and chocolates left for us. There's a separate lounge on the 7th floor with complementary tea and coffee facilities where I enjoyed the city views. The food  both in the bar and at breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. I found all the staff friendly and helpful from arrival to check out. I'll definitely return again. ",5,2017,10,05
219,"Outdated rooms, no control of room temp, and next to train station","This hotel looks great from the street and from the first floor desk: architectural on the outside, modern on the inside. However, the hotel has no elevator. As soon as you get to the second floor landing you can feel the drastic temperature difference from no central air system. The floors are creaky and hallways narrow. The room was quite outdated (tub facia was cracked), you have no temperature control other than the desk fan and mini-heater they place in the room for you. We had a room at the end, so before bed we could hear the restaurant workers next door dumping trash and chatting in the alley. Plus, it's right next to the train station, and the train runs about every 20 minutes. I was told it didn't run all night, and to be fair, I was able to fall asleep and don't ever recall hearing the train at night. But the heat in the room necessitated us keeping the windows open, so every sound was amplified. They did serve a full breakfast, but that room was always stifling hot and we couldn't stand to be in there long, so we ate quickly and ran.",2,2017,10,04
219,Ideal For Anyone Who Enjoys Stifling Heat and The Sound Of Trains,"Probably my worst ever hotel experience. Met with vacant looks by staff on reception when we tried to air our qualms. Booked it via Secret Hotels - it was described as a 4 star hotel (HA!) near the 3arena with a roof terrace. They know well that people will assume it is the Gibson. The Gibson it is NOT. Our room was fine, but three star at best. The bathroom very old and tired with a very noisy fan. The heat was utterly stifling, we turned off the radiators and opened our window hoping the room would cool down and we would get some sleep. No such luck, the heat never abated. And the trains started roaring past our window - literally right past our window - at 6am and continued every 2-5 minutes for the rest of the morning. I honestly don't understand how a hotel is being run from this establishment. It might as well be IN the train station. Just awful. DO NOT BOOK!",1,2017,10,03
219,Three miserable nights in this highly overrated hotel,"I travel extensively and can honestly say this is the worst four star hotel I have ever stayed in. This hotel is tired and in need of a total refurbishment. Our room felt dirty with stains on carpets, broken tiles etc. This is not a four star hotel! The rooms are very noisy and not just from the trains and traffic but the hall noice is significant due to the poor condition of the carpets and floors and fire alarms in the mornings were impossible to sleep through. The heating/ cooling system in our room did not work properly which we reported but were told it was an old system and there was nothing they could do. I expressed my concerns regarding my room to the front desk after the first night and was told there was nothing they could do. A manager was suppose to contact me but never did. I stayed in a premium room with club lounge access, which included drinks and snacks. When I went up the first morning I was told I could only have coffee and if I wanted to have any of the few little muffins or few pieces of cheese or fruit it would cost 11 Euro per person. If you saw the meager offering you would laugh. All in all a very disappointing experience.",1,2017,10,02
219,Nice,"Lovely hotel, rooms cleaned every day , nice facilities, including sauna. Only down side was that for a hotel, u cudnt get a drink after 11.30, when the rest of the city never slept,, shame when your on holiday!! 
",4,2017,10,02
219,"Lovely, Friendly Hotel","I had booked a couple of nights away for my partners birthday present, we arrived at the hotel early, the staff were very friendly and took our bags off us so we were able to explore Dublin.
We walked everywhere from the hotel it‚Äôs a good location and is on the bus route from the airport.
The room was lovely and it was a lovely surprise to have suite so it gave us lots of space! The only downside was were right next to the train/tram which was very noisey and woke us up a few times, although I knew about this before we arrived and was prepared to take the risk. 
We ate in the restaurant for the first evening, the staff again were so friendly. The food was lovely and couldn‚Äôt be faulted. 
I would definitely return and recommend the North Star Hotel.",4,2017,10,02
219,Mixed,"Room was updated and quite lovely. But...our room was so hot. Very hot. The eco AC system simply does not have the capability to keep up with sunlight flooding and heating up the room.We tried to crashed after checking in from an overnight flight for a few hours and we were miserable and sweaty. Asked for fans numerous times - never received them.There is no way we are the first to complain about this. Finally allowed to move to another room facing a bit away from the sun which was cooler. Several simple moves on management's part could help alleviate the problem and prevent unhappy guests: get black out shades that also help block heat, if its not possible to invest in a better AC system, at least provide decent fans or portable AC units to those rooms that you know have strong sun exposure. Continental breakfast was very nice on the 7th floor and snacks and coffee machine offered all day was awesome. I just wish they had addressed their AC problem - no way I can risk returning and dealing with that again.",3,2017,10,01
219,"Very disappointing stay - wifi drops constantly, breakfast organisation and mess and distracted staff","Very disappointing stay. The hotel looks nice and the rooms and bed are comfortable. But:
1. Wifi drops constantly (every 5 mins or so). And you have to look up your individual on the smart TV to get the password. So if you are watching TV, you have to exit the TV to look up the smart password time after time
2. Room service menu is very limited. I had a caesar chicken salad and the amount of chicken in the dish was paltry
3. Organisation around breakfast is chaotic. Nobody explained it was next door and to access you need a separate key card (which they keep at reception) And as the hotel does keep a credit card on file, you need to pay before breakfast. When I was told this by the restaurant (when I eventually found it and got the separate key card) I went and got my purse, only to be told, on arrival, that you have to get a voucher from another place in the building.
4. On leaving, I asked the staff what was the quickest way to get a taxi as I was going to the airport. The sole person on reception said they would order me a cab and asked me to wait in reception. After 15 mins or so, I asked when the cab was arriving only to be told  by the receptionist that she had not had time yet to order me a taxi. Another guest in the hotel then informed me that there is a taxi rank just opposite the hotel. 

The hotel has a lot of potential but it seems to have forgotten that guests want an easy stay",2,2017,10,01
219,Very good,"A very good hotel. We read the other reviews of this hotel on trip advisor before booking and specifically requested the 'new' section of the hotel which they call 'the address'. Because of this we got a room in the nice new part of the hotel which has all the mod cons and was furtherest from train lines. If you can guarantee this part, then great. Otherwise like other reviews you may want to give it a miss if you're in the old part. Other than that good location, good bar and restaurant and good staff. No Raddison Blu, but not as dear either.",4,2017,09,30
219,A new standard of luxury? I hope not!,"Oh dear, where to start! I'm on a business trip and really should be sleeping now. Because I know I won't get to sleep till midnight I'm writing this instead! After the previous 3 nights of trains passing 8ft from my window every 7-8 mins I know when it's time for lights out! Anyway, I thought I booked the North Star hotel - turns out it's 'the address'. Don't know what the difference is? Maybe the North Star is on the side where there are no trains? Nothing seems to be easy here... I feel like I'm at the reception desk every 5mins asking for help?? I had a nice gent show me to my room when I checked in and tell me how to work my lights, but I had no idea where to go for breakfast or the gym! Did I mention there's a train going past my window? Sure I won't hear it though cos it's triple glazed plexiglass! After two nights I was kindly moved two floors up, but I guess the triple glazed plexiglass rule doesn't apply on this floor as it's actually noisier!! Nothing works and they don't seem to care. I asked for my lobby light to be fixed twice and it still doesn't work. I don't even know if they looked at it (I'm checking out tomorrow so give up) each time I go to the gym my card doesn't work and they give me a new one. The iron spilled rusty water all over my white shirt. No air con in the gym, and sauna doesn't heat up - and yes, I know it's on a timer, cos that bit actually works! Nice food and rooftop lounge is nice touch. Pleased I'm not paying over 200euro per night out of my own pocket though!! Roll on 5am when the trains wake me up and I can check out of here üòÖ",1,2017,09,27
219,Below average ,"Not a great stay!

My room was described to me as a quieter room on the 2nd floor.

However, loud traffic, people shouting in the street, the elevator and people passing in the corridor kept me awake at night.

The bath room was outdated and in need to repair.

My room, a little tired and past it's best.

Again the gym was outdated and the dodgy air conditioning in the gym room made it hard to breath.

I wasn't told about the fire alarm test so when the alarm sounded I asked several of the maids, not one of them spoke English.

I doubt I'll stay again",2,2017,09,26
219,Two days in Dublin after a tour around the rest of the country,"The hotel was nicely decorated in an updated style, however the bathrooms should be re-thought.  It was nearly impossible to keep water inside the shower and the tub drained extremely slow.  The room was clean, but the carpet needs deep cleaning.  The balcony was small but a real plus.  The front desk help upon check-in was rude and impatient.  The included breakfast was satisfactory.  The location of the hotel was convenient.  They could use more elevators.",4,2017,09,25
219,Dublin weekend,"Lovely hotel, a little outside city centre but really comfortable & friendly.  Nice touch was lounge on 7th floor where you can relax & have a hot beverage & cake or continental breakfast on weekdays. Ate at the hotel restaurant where the food was excellent and reasonably priced and the staff absolutely charming.",5,2017,09,18
219,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is on a busy main road, opposite the train station, which was ideal for us. The interior...reception ...bar...parlour...restaurant were all very impressive in there own way. Breakfast, plenty of choice, but expensive. Good food severed in the restaurant, and drinks at the bar were quite expensive. My only complaint about the room was that the electric cable for the hair dryer went through the top draw, which made it very difficult to use. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,09,18
219,Don't waste your money! Find another place!,"First time in Dublin and I wanted to be close to the action so decided to pick a hotel that was well located and a place we could rest after a long road trip and a long day sight seeing around Dublin. So I contacted the hotel to get a better idea as to location and distance to sights such as st Patrick's Cathedral and Guinness Store House. I was told everything was 5-10 minutes walking. When we arrived the receptionist showed me to the room.  I was told that we were staying in the original (old part of the hotel). No elevator to go the second room was a bad sign. The room has old carpeting and the floor is not even. The worst part is that there is no air conditioning. The window is right next to the metro. I payed too much money for a hotel that was supposed to be a 4 star, where breakfast was not even included. People need to be aware of what they are getting into. I don't recommend this place! üëé",1,2017,09,17
219,Fabulous hotel ,"Just home from a super night in The Address at Dublin 1. Everything from start to finish was 100%. Conveniently located across the road from Connolly station, so we took the train to heuston and luas to hotel, so easy, left the car at home. Really nice reception area, newly renovated. Staff excellent. Very courteous and professional. We were shown to our room, it was gorgeous. Room 544. Our rate includes access to rooftop business lounge on the 7th floor. A nice touch, complimentary water, tea/coffee (really good coffee), biscuits, and accessible 24 hours per day. The room is so nicely decorated, lovely muted greys, plush pillows, duvet, really good king bed. Coffee machine in room, complimentary water, chocolate & crisps. Great too to have the fridge, there is a spar shop next door so handy to keep minerals etc cool. Bathroom spotlessly clean. Great shower. The electronic controls for everything is cool, curtains, lights etc. We will definitely be back. ",5,2017,09,17
219,Fab communal areas no so fab rooms,"I recently stayed at the Northstar for a weekend break for a birthday , We we're all really impressed as soon as we entered the lobby , it's clear that all of the money has been spent on the communal areas as the rooms are no where near the same standard.
We stayed in a triple room , shabby furnishings , poor finishes and workmen outside of our bedroom door , we reported it as soon as we arrived and were told 'they will be finished soon ' 
Having said that the service was good, the breakfast was amazing (although it should be for 16 Euros) and it is situated very close to the centre , i just don't think it reflects the pictures they use on their website which is disappointing.",3,2017,09,16
219,A very high tech hotel!,"An excellent hotel from all aspects room, services, amenities, location ... etc. this hotel is under the same company and reception that has the attached hotel which is North start hotel so make sure which one you book.

It is a very high tick room hot that all lighting and curtains can be controlled by touchscreen  or through the remote control.

Staff are friendly and helpful with very quick response to the query.

The only thing that I have issue with is the gym which it's located under the building of the North Star hotel which most of the devices are old and out of date with poor of ventilation.  As the rial beside it but its not an issue it will hardly heard.

If they have a gym with high tech as the rooms I would consider this hotel as 5 star and not 4.

I would very recommend it.",4,2017,09,13
219,Dublin 2017,"Down town location, concierge very helpful, cafe and restaurant were great. Hotel room was adequate. Short walk to O'Connell Street and hop on hop off bus. Dinner at O'Neill's pub was a true pleasure.  
",4,2017,09,12
219,A mixture of very good and not so good,"The hotel is a mixture of what looks old, the exterior and new, the main foyer and bar area. The location is reasonably close to key areas of the city with train services very close. The breakfast area has a bit of a dungeon feel to it, located at the bottom floor of the complex. Breakfast itself was quite satisfactory, buffet in nature. Opposite to the breakfast area is the gym, smallish in size but has all the necessary equipment. Our room whilst satisfactory does need some refurbishment. The TV worked intermittently due to a loose cable, the desk chair and desk were cracked and worn, the bathroom area had cracked and loose tiles. Overall pleasant enough but in need of some upgrade.",3,2017,09,12
219,Great girly stay,"We stayed for 2 nights for a friend's 40th. We found the hotel very nice, clean, ideal location & staff were great. Our room was ready early so we left our luggage & walked into the action (15mins). Our rooms were very clean, spacious & well equipped with tv, tea/coffee, hairdryer, safe & iron. It was a quiet location but still convenient with lots near by. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,09,11
219,"Beautiful public areas, but?","This hotel, is 2 in 1 , the North Star and the much nice The address at Dublin 1. You cannot fault the public areas, lobby, restaurant, bar, breakfast room. However the triple room we had booked was dated, the lampshade was ripped and askew, the mattresses were really thin and springy. The bathroom panel was loose and there was badly done mastik around it and a gap  between the panel and floor, the grout was yellowing. It was completely out of place with the rest of the hotel. Breakfast was expensive but well worth it, everything looked/tasted lovely and was hot and fresh, and was a self serve buffet with plenty of choice. I could not get any wifi in my room and had to stand in the corridor outside to use phone/IPad. The area outside around the corner was a bit dodgy, there were definitely drug users about, we were warned to be v careful when returning from an evening out, especially near the railway bridge. There is a lot of outside noise and the walks seem paper thin, you could clearly hear room conversations from the corridor.",3,2017,09,10
219,Little gem,"Great location. Doesn't look much from the outside but my jaw dropped when I walked in.
Lovely staff And the roof top breakfast was lovely. It has the train line going through it and our room looked over it but we never heard a thing.",5,2017,09,08
219,Wonderful experience in Dublin,"The location of this hotel is good if you are traveling by train. It is a bit out of the way and ten minutes to O'Connell Street and a good half an hour walk to Grafton Street for shopping. There are some drunks around at night so I didn't feel comfortable on my own.
The hotel itself is really beautiful and the food in the adjoining restaurant is exceptional. We stayed four nights and had breakfast every morning. The continental breakfast is very good and the warm Irish breakfast very enjoyable. We had lunch and dinner at the restaurant and were very happy with the quality of the food and service. The personnel were lovely and very helpful. We had trouble with the Internet reception as well the the TV stations. They took care of it immediately. We would recommend this hotel and will certainly stay here again.",4,2017,09,06
219,Perfect One Night Stay,"Stayed here the night of the All Blacks match in the Aviva in november. I chose the hotel purely because of the location, it was convenient to Busaras, and also to connoly to take the DART to the Aviva.

The room was very clean, and spacious, I couldnt find a fault. Staff at check in and check out were hospitable and very friendly. 

We ate in the restaurant downstairs, would definitely recommend the teriyaki wings, next time I'm in Dublin I will be back for some!",5,2017,09,01
219,New York chic meets Bates Motel,"Don't let the new slick reception area deceive you. The staff are indeed lovely and money has clearly been spent on the foyer area but sadly it ends there. 
The rooms are dated and the furniture must be at least 20 years old. The first room we were given smelt of stale cigarettes and in fairness we were moved as soon as we complained however, it seems the entire 'non smoking' hotel smells the same.
The clump of long hair and short and curlies around the bath were I assume complimentary and the spots of blood on the carpet really brought out the shine in the 1980's veneer dressing table.

Thankfully my husband is in charge of signing off where staff from his multinational company stay on work visits. It's safe to say he won't be subjecting any of his team to the North Star.",2,2017,09,01
219,Four star service three star hotel room,I recently stayed at the North Star hotel in Dublin got a four star customer service from the staff but the room was three star. The room which was on the fourth floor did not reflect the nice and modern  reception. The bathroom could do with a make over and the toilet wouldn't flush properly. We ordered a margarita pizza for room service it was terrible!,3,2017,08,31
219,Nice hotel,My wife and I are just back from spending  3 days here.we haven't  been here in 3 years and there have been a lot of changes outside  looks the same  inside very modern hotel pleasant  staff .clean rooms and a very good breakfast  we will be going back  to here in the near future  only one complaint we found the hotel too warm.,5,2017,08,31
219,Nice hotel and friendly staff ,"Recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with my partner, booked a premier king room. We originally booked a standard room but paid and extra ¬£100 to upgrade to the premier as the Facebook page and many reviews stated the premier lounge was a rooftop bar and it wasn't until arrival we realised it wasn't a private bar? Not sure if this was due to misinformation or false advertisement, although the free water and coffees did come in handy! Have to note that our keycard sometimes didn't work though so we weren't able to access the lounge - at 11pm and being out all day and staying on the 7th floor we really couldn't be bothered to go back downstairs. Overall first impressions of the hotel, was that it was really lovely, all of the hotel staff were extremely friendly and attentive, the lobby is really gorgeous, with a spacious seating area and the reception and concierge are happy to help with where's abouts of attractions and how to get there, such a temple bar which is about a 10 minute walk from this hotel! Our room was really big and extremely clean on arrival, the cleaning staff were very attentive but our room only got cleaned once due to us being in the rooms at the time when they came, we expected them to come back whilst we were out but that didn't happen - we managed to get clean towels easily so it wasn't a problem. The air con wasn't the best either but this wasn't too much of an issue as it wasn't that hot until our last day and it was quite uncomfortable without it. We also would have expected for the price of our room that we would get a double bed but we had two singles pushed together with a thinner mattress on top. I have to note that the restaurant adjoining the hotel was really incredible, the food is amazing and the cocktails were up there with the best we'd tried! Although the room was a slight disappointment the charm of the hotel and its staff definitely made up for it! ",3,2017,08,29
219,"4 star hotel, 5 star reputation","Could not recommend this hotel more. We've stayed twice now, and had brilliant experiences both times. The staff are so professional and attentive, and the facilities have had an upgrade since we last stayed. It was a lovely surprise and entertained me to no end, playing with the light settings and the tablet controlling the TV. We ordered room service as well, which was ok, but we probably wouldn't do it again, with so many gorgeous restaurants a stone's throw from the hotel. One of my only complaints was the heat in the ladies toilets in the bar, which felt like a sauna, and an awful smell that we couldn't identify. When I told the barman he said that it had always been like that. It was late on so we just went back to the room. Also, we had booked a room with a balcony but there were none available when we arrived. The room we were placed in faced a wall so there was a lot of light blocked from coming into the room. It was less noticeable than we first thought, but I was still disappointed. All that said, it didn't make our stay any less brilliant. The hotel deserves every star it has, and all the new updates will surely bring that 5th star.",5,2017,08,29
219,Hen party visit ,"Just back from three days at this hotel.
Stayed in the older part of the hotel which was fine for a hen party, we were hardly in the room much, it's a little tired but nothing drastic. Our room had two single beds and a double bed. The hotel itself is lovely with a fantastic reception area and lovely out door area and plenty of indoor seating, I would recommend this hotel, the staff were very friendly!",4,2017,08,29
219,"Excellent food, outstanding service",I recently took a large group of Cub Scouts to have a meal at The pub within the Northstar Hotel. The food was wonderful and the service was outstanding. We have come to eat here for the past 4 years and always enjoyed a very warm welcome. Many thanks Rob.,5,2017,08,28
219,Nice hotel good location ,"Stayed here one night for comic con. On arrival had to wait about 5-10mins to check in as there was queue. Reception staff for nice and friendly. Got checked in around 11am which was brilliant. Room was a triple room, big enough and was clean. Room was beside the dart which you could hear but I knew this before I booked the hotel so can't complain. 
Hotel is right beside the train station, luas and taxi stops...which is super handy. Within Walking distance to convention centre too and only a ten minute walk from O'Connell street. Went to the bar in the evening for drinks. Strawberry daiquiri is the best daiquiri is the best I have ever tasted!!!!! Bar staff friendly. Used the restaurant  for lunch next day. Really nice food and reasonable too. Would recommend this hotel. ",4,2017,08,28
219,"Average, Nothing Special","The hotel itself is nice and the addition of the restaurant and concierge services in the lobby is welcome. However, certain extremely common amenities were missing from the North Star, making our experience at the hotel underwhelming. This includes, but is not limited to, poor lighting in the bathroom making it impossible to see yourself in the mirror, extremely limited views of Dublin's beautiful downtown and poor A/C systems in the rooms we booked. 

All in all, the stay at the hotel was fine, however, I would advise on finding a hotel closer to River Liffey or the Brazen Head if you're touring in Dublin.",3,2017,08,27
219,1 Night Stay,"Great location, rooms clean spacious and modern! Located across the road from Connolly station, offers car parking (small car park at side/back of hotel) good restaurant & bar within the hotel also.  Great",5,2017,08,24
219,Top Quality Hotel,"We came over to stay for a long weekend. The room was absolutely superb, a top quality suite. The room was luxurious and spotless. 

There is a rooftop terrace with complementary tea or coffee. The views look out over the city and the train station. 

There are shops just around the corner, and transport is not an issue with a taxi rank opposite and also Connolly Station opposite. 

The staff were friendly and most helpful. The buffet breakfast was spot on. 

We will definitely stay again, the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Thank you for making our visit so special. ",5,2017,08,23
219,"First impression great, room less great","The hotel lobby looked super neat and modern. The staff was very helpful and hospitable. Room and beds were clean, but not as modern as the rest of the hotel would make you to expect. The joints all over the bathroomfloor were really moldy. Rest of the bathroom made an old impression (from the '90) And there was an (really) unpleasant undifined smell, that lasted throughout the whole stay. (Smoke/mold). We were quite disappointed.
Central location and short trip walking to city center. ",2,2017,08,23
219,NorthStar on Amiens ,"The ""Address"" is the new part of the North Star which was built in the 1800's
Our room was state-of-the art brand new. The room, the bed, the pillows, bathroom all excellent.
The hotel is right across the street from Connelly Train station and is within walking distance from all the places you will want to see. Locals said the area north of the hotel was a bit seedy at night but we never had a hint of a problem.
Would highly recommend. But ask for ""the Address"" on checkin.",5,2017,08,22
219,An Overnight Stay To Remember,"Excellent hospitality shown to my parents during their overnight stay for the Kerry vs Mayo GAA Match at the weekend. The food was exceptional also. This is a great place with excellent staff. It's highly recommended, thanks so much guys!",5,2017,08,21
219,NOT worth the stars given,Very shabby room.food not good.not 4 star hotel .stayed in many even B&b are better than here. no bathrobes no slippers as usual in 4 star hotels.cheap toiletries.room service add an extra 5euro to the price. there are many scams going on in this hotel so beware !!! most people have to change rooms. railway runs straight through this is not mentioned.,2,2017,08,20
219,Great place for starting out,"We spend two nights here after arriving in Dublin. It is a well-situated spot for seeing the sights - all within a respectable walking distance and the concierge was most helpful in steering us to our sights. The rooms were comfortable and relatively quiet - inside view of the sheep was intriguing. We were in the older section but that wasn't a problem. There were, however, issues with the maintenance of our bathroom that need to be addressed - spots of mold in the tile grouting and very loose handrails, potentially a slip/fall hazard.",4,2017,08,19
219,Big city feel.,"Very clean and fresh. Felt as though it was just remodeled.Room was fine, located on street level not a problem.Staff was helpful. Great location within walking distance to all Dublin had to offer. Felt very safe at all times.",4,2017,08,18
219,Fantastic staff and hotel,"Arrived at 11.30am to ask if they could look after our bags and was surprised to know our room was ready to check in... hotel is very modern, clean and beautiful.. only criticism is our room was very hot as it was bright sunshine the day we went. But by the evening it had cooled down as the air con was on all day. The staff are all so nice and friendly and helpful. We had access to the rooftop bar and lounge from our room and it was amazing - the hotel staff helped my other half to propose whilst we were there and they did an amazing job at making it a successful and romantic proposal. The gentleman on reception (really sorry can't remember his name) was fantastic so helpful and went out of his way to make our stay perfect! The food in restaurant was lovely as was the food in the parlor, prices weren't too bad! We will definitely be returning again, couldn't fault it at all!
Thank you everyone - it was a trip to remember and the hotel staff and it's facilities were brilliant!",5,2017,08,17
219,Just the ticket,"A little unsure when we booked after reading some of the reviews but needn't have worried. Easy to get to, parking at the station a few hundred yards away ‚Ç¨9:50 /day, friendly staff and a nice room. Not one of the recently refurbished rooms but spacious, clean and well appointed. No issues with train noise or road noise at all. ",5,2017,08,15
219,Lovely hotel,"Second time I stayed here, come back yesterday. Stayed with my boyfriend we are 28-30 yrs old. Hotel is beautiful and location is good.walking distance to main bars but maybe get a taxi if you're a girl with heels. Breakfast was about 17 euro each for full Irish buffet, it's worth it! If you want a recommendation for a good bar then go big bobs. Live music, fairly priced drinks and friendly atmosphere. Hotel room has iron, hairdryer and tea facilities, oh and a safe.",5,2017,08,14
219,Lovely Dublin,"Terrific location, loved the breakfast, staff were smiling and helpful.  handy for buses, hotel  had major makeover and rooms are luxurious complete with large tv and language channels,  dressing gown and slippers! Wouldn,t stay anywhere else",5,2017,08,13
219,2-star Accommodation at 4-star Prices,"Shabby rooms with beat up furniture (that wasn't very nice to begin with) and bathrooms that were last remodeled 25 years ago. This isn't even close to being the 4-star hotel they tout themselves as being. Way, way overpriced.",2,2017,08,13
219,Upgrade ,"Bought for daughter in law to be 21st
Emailed to see about upgrade or bottle of wine in room.
Was offered an expensive upgrade which i declined. 
On their arrival they where informed they basically had a crap room with no view etc. Did they want to upgrade ? They felt they had to ...shame as was a gift from me....on the plus side it cost a lot less than what I was offered by email. 
Felt a bit ripped off to hear  this and will be visiting ourselves later this year but obv not to this particular hotel now. 
 ",2,2017,08,12
219,Lovely Hotel,Just came back from a long weekend in Dublin (3 nights) Stayed at the North Star Hotel....Very well maintained and very stylish 4 Star hotel.....All staff was very welcoming and can't assist us enough if we need anything...Rooms are very well presented and the location is perfect....Just 5 mins from tram or Hop-on Hop-off stops/ station. We had an amazing time and would stop here again.,5,2017,08,11
219,"Paid for 4 star hotel, but it was more like 2 star!","Came to Dublin as a treat after recovering from an illness. Our room was shabby, with the formica peeling off the furniture, stains on the lampshades and grouting around the bath discoloured. The air con was outdated and noisy. The shower was extremely low powered. The room was at the back of the hotel, on the ground floor with virtually no natural light getting in, therefore had to have the light on all the time (how depressing!). Large blue bins for refuge collection were lined up right outside our window. The breakfast was just ok. The housekeeping staff were very pleasant and courteous, as were the staff in Mcgettican's Cookhouse. The food here was very good and great value.",2,2017,08,11
219,"A Last Minute Change, and Was Worth It","We had planned a romantic trip to Dublin as we had not been in around 10 years. We booked  a very smart 5 star hotel off St. Stevens and looked forward to it, a bit of class and luxury. However, some friends found out we were coming and the aspect of the trip changed and we realised that we would not be in the hotel so much so why splash out. We decided to down grade a little and found the Address North Star.

Well, what a great decision. Although not having the plushness of the original hotel, the quality was excellent. Ok, its maybe on the north side of the Liffey but everything in Dublin is easily accessible and the hotel is handy for the bus station, Luas (tram) and Connolly Street Station. You can walk to the Grafton Street within 15-20 mins no problem and there is plenty to take in on route.

I noted someone mention that the trains from Connolly ""made the hotel shake"". This was not our experience at, all and we overlooked the track around 150 yards south of the platform.The train passed directly below our window. I could have jumped onto the roof of it. In the morning you were aware they were there, but no more than a main road and our intention wasn't to be having a lie in a vibrant city like Dublin. (Harsh comment I felt).

We used the 7th floor lounge for continental breakfast which was ideal for something quick before heading out.

The rooms were excellently furbished and you will be short of nothing. There is  a lovely quiet ambiance to the hotel as you wind your way through the old railways arches into which the public areas are built, and the bar is excellently stocked, used by non residents and has great atmosphere.

I would certainly recommend it. Our friends told us that in he past it did not have the best reputation and when we described our room and the hotel they admitted that it sounded like some recent refurbishment had taken place. If this hotel is trying to make a mark of quality in this area of Dublin then its doing a grand job.

Make sure you visit some of the local pubs in the area. less touristy and great Craic.",4,2017,08,10
219,Concierge ,"Hotel nice, sauna lovely but it was the concierge that made it for us! Really helpful and friendly... a true delight! Bar/restaurant next door seemed nice though only had a drink, next to a train line but couldn't hear it in the room. ",4,2017,08,05
219,"Central location, but bad value for the money","The rooms were not fresh and there seems to be serious plumbing issues in the building. I had to change rooms and I had to ask for help with the toilet three times in total! The price is just too high for what you actually get. Considering the fact that the breakfast is mediocre (the coffee is very weak and the selection of bread etc. is limited) and that there are a lot of drug dealers hanging around the block. The trains that pass Connolly Station shake the whole building every ten minutes. The walls do not isolate sounds very well so you will hear all vehicles driving by, as well as what your neighbours are up to (go figure). The carpets in the rooms as well as in the stairs and hallways of the hotel are dirty and not fresh. The most positive thing I can remember from my stay was that the receptionists were friendly and service oriented. When I told them about the plumbing problems they were quick to apologize and to address the issue. But for the price paid, I would have expected a higher quality on the rooms and of the breakfast!",2,2017,08,05
219,Not worth the cost,"Not worth the cost -definitely doesn't deserve 4 stars, probably not even 2.

- faulty plumbing, we had to change room. Twice.
- faulty elevator (one permanently out of order,the other unpredictable)
- noisy (!) rooms - you will hear (and feel) the trains passing every 10 minutea and your neighbours coughing, so imagine what else you will hear in the halls...
- outdated rooms - dirty carpets on the floors and broken floor tiles. Orange and brown seems to be the trend.
- location ok central in dublin (10-15 min walk to centre and temple bar but across the river) however we had daily fights and drug deals taking place on the doorstep of the hotel, so slightly dodgy...
- hotel policy: we don't provide you a mini bar but please don't eat ANY of your own food on our premises. What?!",2,2017,08,03
219,Clean and modern,"The hotel was clean and modern, and room was very spacious.

My only complaint would be that there was no air con in our room and as it was facing the main road it was too noisy at night to keep the window open.

Otherwise, staff were very helpful and the location was very good. Would stay again.",4,2017,08,01
219,Absolutely brilliant,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the North Star with my boyfriend and it was amazing. I had stayed here about 3 years ago in a standard double room and even then it was good, but since then the hotel has been refurbished to a sleek, modern d√©cor and this time I stayed in an Executive Club King Room, which was well worth the money. The standard of luxury is brilliant and they really have gone above and beyond to make it worth the money. They have upgraded the rooms with smart technology, so we could operate all the lights and even open and close the curtains with a touch of a button. There was also complimentary Dairy Milk chocolate in the fridge, which is always guaranteed to win chocoholics like me over. We also had access to the rooftop lounge, which wasn't quite what I expected As well as that, the hotel was just a high standard, robes were provided and the cleaner did a brilliant job. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're looking for something more high end, I absolutely loved my stay here and it really made my trip to Dublin brilliant.",5,2017,07,30
219,Best Kept Secret,"The hotel is subtly located. Inside it brings a welcoming atmosphere and the staff are very very helpful.  I was needing to print some papers for a presentation and they were very glad to do it for free.  The business lounge, though small is also cozy with a great view of part of the city.  The person in charge of the lounge, she is very courteous with a lovely smile, she helps a lot to make you settle comfortably. Thanks.",5,2017,07,29
219,Very expensive rip off,We stayed as a couple in the hotel based on reviews. However we paid over 200 euros per night for a tired room. On arrival the reception area was very impressive. However on check in we were directed up a corridor through a security door into what seemed to be a back hotel. The room we were given was in a back corridor with tired facilities that overlooked another part of a hotel. Very disappointing especially considering the price we paid for 2 nights. ,1,2017,07,29
219,"Excellent location, facilities and staff","I recently stayed here for two nights and must admit that I had been dubious having read the previous reviews however I could not fault this hotel ..... and I would be quite hard to please.
Bedroom was spotlessly clean, bed very comfy and peacefully quiet. We enjoyed breakfast on each morning, buffet style with a varied choice to suit all. We also dined in the restaurant both nights - food was excellent. Specific compliments and thanks to David, restaurant, who is charming, his customer service skills are fantastic and he is a credit to this hotel.",5,2017,07,27
219,Great stay with exceptions... Pay attention at point of booking!,"I would say half of this hotel is 5 star and the other half is 3 star... 

Our first experience was with the 3 star portion; also known as the older part of the hotel. You need to be specific when you make your booking that you want to stay in the newer, air conditioned portion of the hotel. The rooms were still nice in the older portion, but as others are mentioning, it gets hot over there without AC, you face a train station, and there aren't elevators to the floors. 

My wife had a polite conversation with the front desk (no screaming or demanding; it's not their fault we didn't research the hotel long enough to understand the layout), and we stayed in the newer portion of the hotel for the remainder of our trip. The front office manager was EXTREMELY polite and super helpful (ask for Ela!), and she put us in a super nice room in the newer portion of the hotel. From then on, I would give the hotel a 5 star rating. This was by far the nicest room we stayed in throughout all of Ireland.",4,2017,07,26
219,Family short stay,Hotel was very comfortable.Food was good.The staff were very pleasant and helpful and couldn't do enough for us.I couldn't find anything negative about our experience.Would definitely recommend it and would go back.,5,2017,07,26
219,Not what it was  made up to be!!!,"Arriving at North Star hotel in my car I soon realised that the nearest parking was 1 mile away where I had to drag 3 bags from. The reception weren't that friendly and advised me there was no lift to the 2nd floor with my bags. I went in the summer (25 degree heat), no air con in the room ( although a 4 star) and had to suffice to opening the windows which over looked a busy main road and very noisy, so no sleep was had during the night I stayed. I was meant to stay 2 nights and checked out after 1.

I stay at a least 2 hotels a week and normally 4 star. Worst 4 star hotel I have stayed in for a while and not impressed by the cost nor the location. AVOID!

The only positive was the restaurant in the hotel who were excellent and great food.",1,2017,07,25
219,Great Stay,"Booked to coincide with U2 concert in Dublin. Bit nervous as appeared just out of town & overlooking train lines, but shouldn't have been. 

Great location for train (Conolly station) & tram (Luas) 50 metres away, no more than 5 / 10 minute stroll to O'Connell street and heart of Dublin.

Great room, in the new / recently renovated section of the hotel (The Address).
Staff helpful. Internet access (WiFi) was good / as expected for a hotel

Highly recommended",5,2017,07,25
219,A nice way to start our vacation ,"What an enjoyable hotel.  The rooms appear to have been recently refurbished and modernized.
Gym is way more than adequate, internet also.  Would have liked more and varied TV and movie choices. 
Located very conveniently to the tram and bus services.  ",4,2017,07,24
219,Great stay,"I came for a weekend with friends. This hotel has been recently refurbished and extended. We were staying in the new part and our rooms were lovely with lots of nice touches. The air conditioning, lights and curtains are all controlled by a panel beside the bed. Each room had a Nespresso coffee machine, safe and fridge with complimentary chocolate, crisps and water. Our rooms also gave us access to the private club rooms with a lounge, outside seating area, newspapers and on tap tea, coffee, fruit and biscuits.  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant. It offers a bistro style menu and all meals were very good. They also have a nice bar area and a good cocktail menu.

Breakfast was good, we had the choice of a continental breakfast in the upstairs club room or a full cooked breakfast in the main breakfast room. 

All staff were polite and helpful. 

I would stay here again.
",5,2017,07,23
219,Excellent Hotel,"Have to give this Hotel 5 stars. We stayed in a club king room - staff at reception were great and we were shown to our room. Hotel room was lovely, beautiful bathroom and the bed was extremely comfortable. Went up to club lounge, water was complimentary. We even had a complimentary packet of crisps and dairy milk in our room which I forgot to eat unfortunately. Only one thing the coffee pods supplied were espresso, would prefer a cappuccino or Americano. Will definitely return.",5,2017,07,23
219,Disappointing service and standard ,"I booked this hotel recently for a trip with my two teenage children. It is in a great location however I had a number of problems with my stay which I don't think the hotel staff seemed to give enough attention to.
 
Firstly when I arrived, I was told that I had only booked a double room. I explained that I had double checked my email and it says triple room and I paid more, to which the receptionist pointed to his form and said no it was a double. Clearly this was not my fault or the receptionists fault but his response was pointless. There is obviously an issue between the booking site and the hotel details. He did find me a room with a double and single bed and I was grateful as we were all very exhausted from an active day.

When I got to the room and ready for bed, we discovered a problem with the electrics, only one plug in the room worked. As it was late I decided to get some sleep and report in the morning.

I reported the problem to the receptionist on the morning and he advised he would get someone to look at it.

We arrived back to the hotel late that evening and I asked the reception staff if he was aware if the plugs had been fixed in my room. He didn't know anything about it and I hoped this was a good sign.  Unfortunately when we got to the room there was no change. Again as it was late we just wanted to get to sleep.

I reported the problem to the receptionist in the morning and when she checked the system she said the fault had been noted but there were no maintenance staff available on a Sunday to fix it. 

I had made the most of a frustrating situation and moved furniture to be able to use the hairdryer in the room and asked reception staff to charge phones.  while I accept these difficulties can arise I feel the staff in this situation need to learn how to effectively communicate. I should have been told there were no maintenance staff, I could have been offered an alternative room and I should have had a phone call or message left for me on my return. 

In addition the standard of finish and cleanliness of this room was poor, it was very dated and grubby. I feel that due to the initial booking conflicts I was put in a room that probably was not properly prepared for use. 

I won't be back as there are too many other great hotels and guesthouses in Dublin. ",1,2017,07,22
219,My staying in the hotel - GREAT EXPERIENCE,"I was staying several nights in the hotel. It was great. The best experience was contributed by the consultor (concierge) name - KEIRN 
HE WAS HELPFUL AND KIND AND HE MADE MY STAYING MUCH MUCH BETTER üëç‚ò∫Ô∏è
He is an asset to the hotel , and I will sure come back because of him.

The only thing I didn't like was the BAD behavior and very in kind of the reception stuff called - Eva

219,Convenient for travelers in transit,"Coming in from Belfast by train, catching flight out next day, North Star was a great pick.  Across the street from Connolly Station and a couple of blocks from the Flybus stop, transit was a snap.  Complimentary upgrade to 6th floor room was most appreciated, making for a quieter stay (it is close to train tracks).  Had dinner at hotel restaurant and staff friendly and food very good.  Room was spacious and bed very comfortable.",5,2017,07,20
219,Great stay!,"We got the airport bus into Dublin which was really easy, it stops just down from hotel. We didn't realise we'd actually booked premier rooms, so we had access to the premier lounge on the top floor! This included free bottles of water, tea, coffee and biscuits all day, and a light breakie in the morning - cereal, yogurt, fruit, croissants etc - all we needed which was perfect! Room was fab, big comfy bed, lots of space. Bathroom was nice but my only gripe would be that it's not very well lit in there, it's like it's missing a spotlight. Dressing gown and slippers in the wardrobe, coffee machine, lots of storage space. Reception staff really helpful, they'll book taxis for you. Shops and city centre maybe a 10-15 min walk, and temple bar maybe 30 min?? We got taxis during the evening if going out, it was too far to walk in heels! Great stay, id definitely stay again! Thank you x ",5,2017,07,19
219,Definitely not 5 stars,There are some 4 star hotels that could be mistaken for 5 stars from how great they are. Not this one. The rooms are new and very well furnished and comfortable. But the service isnt that great. To start off there is no valet or parking. You have to park your car at the train stations parking 500 meters away. Then the luggage. When we were leaving we had to load our own suitcases into the car. The train runs at the room's window. Really right at the window. The view is beyond horrible at suite 331. Standard room 336 has no view but thats better. The suite is spacious with a good bathroom. The toiletries are definitely like a 2 or 3 star hotel. You get a shampoo/ shower gel in one and conditioner but they are the big containers that you pump out of rather than the small ones usually found in 4 or 5 star hotels. The reception staff are nice enough but one guy that answers the phone is rude. When i asked for a kettle i was told to use the coffee machine. When i insisted to get one because i have a baby i need to boil water for they got me a dirty one. The location is ok not great. The gym is part of the other old hotel belonging to north star hotels. Only one elevator is available for the new hotel.,3,2017,07,18
219,Good Hotel Not Far From Temple Bar District,"Stayed in a regular hotel room that was fine. Nothing fancy, but a good deal for the money. The room and bathroom were very clean. The beds comfortable. Our room came with the full breakfast each morning which I liked very much. Our walk to Trinity College or to the Temple Bar district took about 15 - 20 minutes. This was our second stay at the North Star and we would stay there again. The hotel is right across the street from Connolly rail station.",4,2017,07,18
219,Room Mix Up - But Very Good Overall,"There was a mixup between our booking and the room being upgraded that required the manager to get us a second room to accommodate our family. This took about 30 minutes but there was no extra charge to us for the room.

The rooms were in ""The Address"" which is the newer part of the hotel. They were very nice and modern. Really cool technology for lighting, AC controls (yes, AC), room attendance, etc. No sheet, just a comforter (duvet), which annoys me, but it‚Äôs the same in most of northern Europe. 

There is a nice roof top self-serve caf√© for those in ""The Address"". I don't think it is accessible by those in the older section of the hotel. I'm also not sure how rooms get booked in the older vs. newer section or if it just luck to get the new one. There was nothing differentiating the two on the mobile website.

Morning breakfast buffet was well stocked but the room got quite busy, likely due to peak tourist season.

The location is great. It is right across the street from Connolly rail station. It's about a block from the bus station. The airport busses (747, 757) drop off on Talbot street coming from the airport and pick up at the bus station. It's a short walk to O‚ÄôConnel street. Within a 20 minute walk to most of the city center attractions. About 30-40 minute walk to Guiness, Teeling, or Jameson.

The restaurant / bar was nice with friendly staff and good food. They were accommodating for our young kids and had goodie bags for them. 

There was some noise from the train line that runs over the lobby and restaurant and next to ‚ÄúThe Address‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt bothersome and didn‚Äôt wake me up. 

We will stay there again if the opportunity arises.",4,2017,07,17
219,Concert Break,"Stayed here a few times when going to a concert. Bus station and Luas across the road so handy. 5 min walk to city centre. Rooms fab, had everything, wifi, fridge. Great choice for breakfast. Staff fantastic. Highly recommend. Roll on September for another concert break! Hopefully the band doesn't cancel this time!........",5,2017,07,17
219,Modern clean &a friendly hotel,"Stayed here for a total of two nights in one of the premier king rooms. The room was modern, spacious, peaceful and most importantly spotless. All the staff from check in to check out were extremely friendly and helpful. We ate in the bar and sampled some of there tasty cocktails which were also faultless. Overall we had a wonderful stay and will definitely be back to this beautiful hotel. ",5,2017,07,17
219,Close to Connolly Station,"We stayed here the last night of a trip, because it is close to Connolly Station. We arrived back in Dublin and had an early flight home. 

We booked  a family room and it was comfortable; two single beds were placed in a room with a double bed. The shower in the bathroom sprayed water everywhere, as the glass shower door would not stay closed. It was a bit messy, but as we were there only one night and did not shower until the morning, there was no point in complaining.

The hotel has a nice restaurant, is close to the train station and Red Luas line, and is within walking distance to the airport bus.",4,2017,07,16
219,Lovey hotel,"We stayed here in June 2017. Very tastefully decorated and a very comfortable room. Was a little pricey but was worth it. Great location to pubs and restaurants, not too far from airport. Would definitely recommend",5,2017,07,16
219,"Great hotel, great staff and perfectly located.","Great hotel. Stayed here for business meeting and after flying 27 hours the staff could not have been more helpful. Stayed on level 7 with club access, very high tech room and extremely quite. Across from the train and tram station and right around the corner from Talbot Street. They do a great breakfast and room service is excellent. Only critique was they didn't take down my credit card details which meant I had to pay as I went for the breakfast and room service but the staff were very helpful each time. 

Will stay here again if ever back in Dublin.",5,2017,07,12
219,Mixed review,"Stayed at this hotel for one night but wouldn't be in a hurry back. On checking in we were asked how we wished to pay even though the room had already been paid for. The room looked nice but was extremely hot. There was no air conditioning, just a small fan which was of no use. We had to leave the window open even though we overlooked a busy street with noise all night. The sheet on the bed was not clean. The bar closed at 1am and there was no residents bar. The only positive was that the food is good and the waiting staff friendly and helpful.",3,2017,07,11
219,"Big rooms, charming property","While this hotel is quite a walk from the city-center, it was clean and comfortable and the room was large!  The property is well manicured and the structure is historic.  We ate in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed a nice steak.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,2017,07,11
219,"Great hotel, perfect for both business and leisure trips.","I've been at North Star in July 2017 for a business trip. 
Courtesy of staff above average, quality of service fast and efficient.
Room and private bathromm were perfectly clean.
Among plus, the wifi is excllent at a very high speed and working smoothly.
The only minus was in the bathroom where lights over the basin were dim so that shaving properly was quite hard.",5,2017,07,11
219,Clean and spacious ,Overall a nice clean hotel our only problem was the plugs in the room never worked!! We called reception and they changed our room which was good but we had unpacked so had to pack again then unpack!!! We had a balcony room which was spacious on 7th floor we had access to a Lounge which had tea/coffee making facilities and comfy chairs with a tv !,3,2017,07,11
219,"Two Separate Hotels, Check Your Booking!","The lobby and bar of this hotel are quite nice. That said, there's two or three separate hotel areas One quite modern and one certainly not. I booked ""North Star"" based on the photos of nice looking rooms, but ended up an unclean room, right on the main road. The front part of the hotel shakes considerably due to the nearby train station. Room was quite hot, no A/C. Shower also did not work properly. 

",3,2017,07,10
219,Not a 4 stars hotel at all,"very small room (room for 1 open suitcase at once....), very out of fashion furniture (at least 30 years old or more...). Not very clean. too expensive for what you get.
Very noisy as well.
You have to go to the desk to pay for your breakfast before eating, they don't charge the room directly. Check well the bill 'cause they overcharged us...
We had not hot water one morning and it did not seem to bother anyone at the reception desk...",3,2017,07,10
219,Superb Hotel,"Stayed here for the weekend of the coldplay concert. It is super modern. Seriously could not complain about anything. Rooms perfect, on site restaurant perfect, staff perfect and all within a short walk of everything. Will definitely come again",5,2017,07,10
219,Very poor experience at hotel,"Had very poor experience at hotel. When I went to check in, there was no room in my name even thou I had pre-paid and had email confirmation. Manager went to reservations to sort out. I was left in reception for 45mins when the reception check- in staff called me to the desk and informed me that the manager was still trying to sort out. I was informed that the hotel was over-booked for this particular night but would check me in and wouldn't be charging me for the room - even thou I said I'd pre-paid via booking agent. The room was very dated and nothing like the room in the photos. 

Very expensive for what was provided. Would not be in a rush back to stay here.

219,Could do better,"We chose this hotel due to it's location with regards to the 3 Arena as we were coming over for an even there.
First impressions weren't great, as there'd been a fire alarm earlier that morning causing a security shutter to close which was proving difficult to open making it impossible to access the hotel from the front so we had to enter from the back through the fog of kitchen staff taking their cigarette break. Once inside we were assaulted by the noise of drilling, part of getting the shutter open, we assumed.
Check in was uneventful and our room on the fourth floor was ready for us. For some reason we had a triple room although there was only the two of us. The room itself was clean and in good order as one would expect if a little dated in decor however that did not detract from its comfort. Our room was at the back of the hotel so we had little street noise and what there was from the trains was not obtrusive.
The gym had what we needed this trip although the rowing machine could do with servicing, as could the bikes and there's not a great selection of dumbbells but, this is a hotel not a health club. 
Can't fault the location, on the doorstep of the station where you can get the Dart and explore all of Dublin bay and within easy walking distance of all the tourist attractions of the city.
Our complaint, like others, was noise. I (my husband is deaf) was woken a 7.30am one morning to the sound of a cherry picker's engine, not great after an evening at a concert at the arena. I enquired about this at reception to be told that it wasn't anything to do with their building so they had no control over it, despite there having been a painter painting the outside of our bedroom window from the cherry picker! When I pointed this out the young lady said she would get a manager to look into it, I also asked that if this was going to be the case the next day they let us know and she said she would. The next morning, and the next (checkout day), the same thing, by this time I was obviously more than a little put out and to be told the same thing by the same person at reception that it wasn't work on their building etc. 
At checkout I spoke to a manager who couldn't have been more accommodating, she apologised for our inconvenience and the fact that we hadn't been moved when we first raised our complaint as there were rooms we could have gone to, she also ensured that we received a refund of a nights stay in way of compensation. What a shame we had to have the initial poor experience or my review would have been so much more positive.",3,2017,07,09
219,Very easonable for the price,"I was a bit doubtful about this hotel as we were booked inn there by someone else and the reviews were mixed. In fact, our experience was towards the upper half of the reviews on TripAdvisor for this hotel. There were no frills but it offered the necessities very efficiently and effectively. Nor did we have any problems with train noise, even though it is at first a little disconcerting when you realise that the hotel is more or less built in between rail lines just emerging from Connelly Station. For me, the only downside of the hotel is its location rather than the hotel itself. The areas around major train stations in any capital city are often not so reassuring. And one frequently needs to cross the Liffey for better dining options than are available on the north side. On the positive side, the location of this hotel is relatively convenient for the Conference Centre and the Financial District, from a work point of view.",3,2017,07,09
219,Dublin Trip 2017 - North Star Hotel - Excellent stay!,"Having reviewed lots of different hotels we decided to stay at the North Star Hotel, upgrading to a Premier Room, whilst in Dublin. The hotel is situated near to Connolly Station but don't let that put you off because we didn't hear a thing.There is a bag drop-off/collection area so if you arrive early, or depart late, you do not have to carry your luggage with you which is a big plus.

Daily breakfast served from 07:00 is excellent so to is the onsite restaurant with much choice for all guests. All the staff were courteous and helpful going out of their way to assist us and providing us, as the traveller, with informative local knowledge and flyers as to what to see and where to go during our stay in Dublin. Local taxi and bus links are outside should you want to travel further afield as is Connolly Station.

It is ideally situated within the area and only 10 minutes walk from O'Connell Street and a further few minutes walk to Temple Bar and the river Liffey. I can only give the highest praise to all hotel staff we encountered during our stay and would 100% recommend the North Star hotel for anyone who is looking to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,07,09
219,Lovely New Find,"Really nice place. Stayed on 3rd level with Club Access. Can't complain so handy for Croke Park and right beside train/dart/Luas line. 

Room small but very clean and quiet. Will definitely be back for another visit. ",4,2017,07,08
219,Very Satisfies and a Nice Night,"Booked a single night due to the hotels central location and couldn't have asked for more. Reception staff friendly. Room excellent - But no bottles of water, however I was told I had access to a lounge on the 7th floor where I could get some. A friend from Dublin met me for dinner... a few more came for drinks and we felt relaxed and were very happy with the meal. Room and bathroom of a high standard (apart from a broken, loose floor tile in the bathroom) and bed was so comfy, but warm with the duvet - Thankfully the aircon kept me comfortable. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise too, as I enjoyed",4,2017,07,07
219,Excellent hotel,"Lovely hotel, very hi tech, you use the remote control/buttons on the wall for everything from lights to curtains to air con. Lovely club lounge with roof terrace. Great location across from Connolly station and a five minute walk to town. Lovely staff in the bar too. ",5,2017,07,05
219,Budget gem,"Given the mixed reviews, I wasn't really sure what to expect (also because we were on a package tour from Great Value Vacations and our pre-booked accommodations in Limerick and Kilkenny had been frankly awful). That said, we were really pleasantly surprised. The first room they offered us was updated but also right on the road and would have been too loud. We asked to move and it was no problem at all--our next room had not yet been updated, but it was blissfully quiet. The gym was also very large and this was also our first hotel in Ireland with staff that were actually pleasant and friendly. Super convenient location across from the tram station and near to the Hop On Hop Off bus. It is a hub for large tourist groups but we didn't find this to be inconvenient or overwhelming. ",3,2017,07,04
219,"Lovely, clean & modern",Stayed here on a hen do. The rooms were really nice & spacious and had everything you need. Beds were very comfortable. The location is brilliant. Be aware you can hear the trams and there wasn't a nice view from our rooms. 24 hour reception service and room service. Drinks are expensive but most places are in Dublin.,5,2017,07,03
219,Great use of technology in guestroom,We stayed on the six floor of the new wing. And associate first brought us to the room to show us how to use all of the up-to-date technology within the room. This took quite a bit of time -  we were tired from traveling and just wanted to get settled. However The room was wonderful! I would have given it a higher rating if not for the noise of the trains Going by. We ate dinner in the restaurant downstairs which was good but the service was a bit slow. However the  hotel was close  to everything and I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're staying in Dublin,4,2017,07,02
219,Easy location,"In Dublin for a business trip. Easy access near to tram and o Connell street quiet room near to good eating, and drinking, so can one ask for more? Recent building works just about completed hence no bother. Busy reception but interrupted a customer,with permission, to quickly sort check out.",4,2017,06,29
219,Group Visit ,"Recent two night stay at the above location hit the spot on every level. 

Located out of the main Temple bar but an easy walk with scattered shops restaurants and good bars make the walk there painless. 

Easy check in and attentive staff with rooms clean and tidy and adequate. 

Will certainly revisit ",5,2017,06,28
219,Wonderful find,"The staff was very helpful and pleasant, for example they advised us how to get to the zoo and what train to take. The rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Location of the hotel is quite good, short walk and you're at the O'Connell street. The train station is right across the street. McGettigans cookhouse and bar was also a great surprise, they have great food. I really liked staying at the hotel and I'm definitely coming back some day. ",4,2017,06,26
219,Comfortable and a good location,We were in Dublin for a couple of days for a concert at the Aviva Stadium and needed a base. The North Star Hotel provided that in spades. It's location is perfect for getting to the attractions Dublin has to offer and is only a few stops on the Dart for the Stadium. The hotel itself is very comfortable and has an excellent restaurant on site. The breakfasts too were superb. The only downside was the shower which left a lot to be desired. Would we come again? Most certainly - for its location and value. ,4,2017,06,26
219,Lovely time !,"I was over the moon with this hotel, it's a new wing off the North Star hotel very nice indeed. I was thrilled with our room everything modern and fresh with a funky keycard that works everything ( my husband loved this !) it also works the curtains and a security light pops on if you need the loo in the night , my only minor criticism would be if you sit too long on the loo you are suddenly plunged into darkness because the light only lasts a few minutes and will switch itself off so you have to feel around for the bathroom door  lol all great tho ! We had a club room so got use of the lounge which serves teas coffee biscuits etc all help yourself, a lovely room with a balcony to sit out and look over Dublin. Our club room was soundproofed ( I think they are anyway) because I didn't hear a thing and I'm a light sleeper, I was thrilled by this ! Just totally loved this bright clean modern hotel ! ",5,2017,06,25
219,Remodeled hotel in central location,"We stayed here as part of a CIE coach tour. The hotel is in a historical building near the train station. It is within walking distance of shopping and attractions.  The hotel has been recently remodeled and attractively decorated. There are two parts of the building.  We were in the older part that appeals to have smaller rooms and be closer to street noise. The area itself is lively but a little seedy. The hotel caters to coach tours.  There is WiFi in the rooms but no business center or public computer as yet. The breakfast buffet is typical for larger hotels. The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The hotel was within walking distance of the central, shopping area and near other attractions.",4,2017,06,23
219,Quite disappointed.,"On arrival there were some serious building work going on to the point I couldn't hear the receptionist and was glad to get out of there.
Room was okay to be fair possibly not 4 star.
Friday morning was awoken at 7am prompt with a deafening noise that seemed to go on for hours (see pic) more building work right outside our room which was on the 7th floor.
Complained at reception who kept saying they will sort it out and compensate us.
No information on Website regarding building work
Not quite what you except for ¬£200 a night hotel.üò£",1,2017,06,23
219,Not 4 star,"We stayed here at the beginning of June for 3 nights. Despite the 4 star rating, I would put this hotel on a par with an average Premier Inn. Initially we were allocated a standard room which we discovered are all on the ground floor, very dated, dark and cramped. We requested a higher floor and had to pay an addition ‚Ç¨90.
There is construction work going on at the rear of the hotel which is not mentioned on their website. The hotel is on a busy road across from the train station. There is no parking at the hotel and no stopping outside. The nearest car park is behind the train station and a 10 minute walk away - be prepared if you have heavy bags!  
All in all this is an overpriced hotel (‚Ç¨600 for 3 nights with continental breakfast) and not one I would choose to stay in again.",3,2017,06,22
219,The Address (North Star Dublin) - Official Review,"We stayed in room 541. Very modern and awesome decor. Wifi worked great, coffee and tea machine. Bath tub/shower was big. We had access to the rooftop which was pretty cool. Location was Amazing!!!!! We walked to Croke Park, Guiness, Jamison, Dublin Castle, etc.....almost everything is accessible from this location. 

We did not eat at the restaurant during our stay.

Cleaning staff was great!!

A few things that might bother some people. It is right by the train tracks so the view was not picture worthy (that was from our room, not sure about others) and if you are a light sleeper i would not advise.

I would stay there every time I come back to Dublin!",5,2017,06,20
219,Just okay,"Our room had dated furnishings and linens. Our room overlooked the garage bins.  The hallways were very hot.  The provided hairdryer never worked, and was never replaced even when I repeatedly asked.  The included breakfast buffet was good.  Dining in the hotel restaurant was very good.  I liked the location within the city.",3,2017,06,20
219,OK hotel,"We stayed at the North Star Hotel. Staff was not friendly or accommodating like at other Irish hotel where we stayed.  The first day was a busy day for them, so we stored our luggage and explored the city.  We got back about 2:15 pm and our room wasn't ready. We had bought sandwiches to eat in our room and were told we could not sit in the lobby and eat the sandwiches.  Dozens of people got their rooms as we sat.  We were the only people left in the lobby. We inquired multiple times and finally around 4:00 we got our rooms.  The air conditioner did not work in my rooms.  They said it would be fixed by the time we came back (from sight seeing)  The temperature was 82 in our room when we returned.  We were given another room. On a positive note, they have an excellent breakfast.",3,2017,06,20
219,"A hotel that is trying to impress but the location lets it down, and some things were taken from the room","I chose this hotel as it was only a few minutes walk from my work. That is one good thing to be said about the location, it is very central and close to sights and shopping. My room was not bad, but the hotel advertises on many sites as having air conditioning. My room was a bit out of date and did not have air conditioning. The shower head also only reached level with my eyes (I am 5ft 8 inches tall) and so I had to crouch a little and lean back to have a shower! The hotel is also directly next to a major railway station and underneath part of the railway line, so intermittently you heard the rumble of the train going past. The bed was very comfortable, and there was a good wi-fi connection and that is all the positives that I have to say about the room. To finish off my interesting visit, my toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash were taken by the cleaner on the first day. I mentioned this to the reception and they just gave me a very cheap, small toothbrush as a replacement. I will not be staying in this hotel again if my belongings are going to be stolen.",2,2017,06,19
219,"Hotel was Dirty, Noisy and Tired","Worst hotel experience I've had, especially for the price. On arrival there were major drilling works taking place in the lobby, it got worse from there...

1. Room dirty
- on arrival found rolling tobacco and crushed cigarette wedged between bed cupboard and wall.
- Bathtub was dirty with hairs

2. Room was NOISY 
Because at 7.30am we were woken by two workmen in a cherry-picker with a very loud engine IMMEDIATELY outside our window. See the photos. The receptionist and then the Hotel Manager denied it had anything to do with them when I rang them, and then only accepted that was happening when I came down to the reception at 8.00am to speak to the Hotel Manager personally. Especially annoying about this was that the works for the hotel then finished at 9.30am. The rest of the day (except morning) they stopped.

3. Room was tired and needed renovation e.g.
- The cupboard was broken
- The lightbulbs was flickering
- A bit of wood had dropped off the underside of the bathroom sink
- The carpet looked like the 1970s had died on it

The only nice things I have to say about this establishment is that a) The bar staff are friendly and b) it has a good location. 

In addition to this review I will be writing to the Hotel for a formal complaint.",1,2017,06,19
219,A TALE OF TWO CITIES,"We spent two nights here.  The first night was part of our tour and the room was very small and cramped.  There was no place to open luggage and baggage service was slow.  While the manager was helpful enough, another desk person was not, everything seeming to be too much trouble for him.  The concierge Cieran (sp?) was a hoot and an asset to the hotel.  The second night which we added placed us in the newer room which was outstanding.  One issue is that the train runs through the middle of the hotel, literally.  We were not bothered by it too much but some people were.  In the end make sure you are in the newer rooms or find another hotel.",3,2017,06,19
219,Double booked! Double disaster!,"Our last visit started badly as they gave us a key to a room, when we got there it clearly already occupied!! They had to send to a porter around to find a vacant room for us! No offer of a discount!! The 'Continental' breakfast doesn't have any hard boiled eggs  which we have on the Continent. if you like bananas for breakfast, bring your own, as they dont have any!",2,2017,06,19
219,Rooms very hot and noisy,"We had a room on the ground floor which was extremely hot and stuffy. To give you an idea, with 15 deg C outside and the windows open all day, the chocolat I had left in the room had started to melt by the end of the day! When we put on the air con it cooled down the room to an acceptable level but unfortunately it was very noisy. When we pointed it out to reception they said they would send somebody to check. It made no difference to the noise. In addition, on the first day we heard very loud drilling noises at 8 a.m. The room in itself was quite nice and spacious, the hotel is situated conveniently, just a few minutes walk from the city centre, the hall is very nice, staff is friendly and breakfast is good. Unfortunately that cannot make up for the fact that we slept very badly in this hotel.",1,2017,06,17
219,Nice hotel with friendly staff,We stayed two nights in Dublin at the North Star and had a great time. The room we stayed on was clean cool and quiet. The one we were originally allocated was just a few metres from the railway line and was not air conditioned. We asked to be moved and the staff were very understanding and helpful. Breakfast was delicious and the hotel is well situated to get to the main attractions. When you book ask to be allocated a room away from the railway line. ,4,2017,06,17
219,The best weekend!,"I'll be honest here... myself and 15 of my friends stayed in this hotel for my hen weekend a couple of weeks ago.  So we weren't here for luxury and relaxation but we do appreciate the slightly more finer things in life...

We loved the hotel.  It was perfect.  We had 4 family rooms and they were great.  Nice and clean and had everything that we would need: a half decent iron, a good shower, comfy beds and clean, fluffy towels.

Breakfast was good.  We didn't upgrade to the full Irish but that suited us.  The full Irish breakfasts did look very good though.

Lobby is beautiful! Staff very helpful.

One thing was that the building work was little noisy, very early in the morning.  So ask for a room away from this and you'll love it.

I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2017,06,15
219,Honeymoon,"We were on our honeymoon and this was our first hotel stop. Walking in, the lobby was gorgeous and modern. You have to walk to the back of the hotel to get to the elevator, but it isn't too bad. Our room was not was pretty was the lobby or near as modern. It was very old/outdated and the bed was not very comfortable. I'm sure a more expensive room would have been nicer and more updated. The concierge was extremely nice and helpful. The location was awesome and walking distance to a lot of places!",4,2017,06,14
219,no parking but lovely hotel,"This is a lovely modern hotel, very clean, new & high tech, we enjoyed our stay and the restaurant staff were great.  However, it wasn't clear when we booked our room the hotel had no parking...for 2 Australians who still had a hire car on our last night in Dublin this was a big nuisance..Only one staff member seemed to be able to direct us over to the Connelly Train station public parking & with all the one way streets this was just a bit epic and not what we wanted to deal with - when we finally found the one & only park on the site we then had to navigate our way through the train station with all our luggage over to the hotel as you are unable to pull up out the front of the hotel to at least drop your luggage off.  So this was inconvenient, annoying and disappointing.  If we didn't have a car to park we would have really enjoyed our stay.",3,2017,06,14
219,Birthday weekend away ,Quite good location but about 20 minute walk from temple bar. Hotel is clean and tidy and has good facilities. It was my partners birthday and they upgraded us to a suite which was such a nice touch. Thank you for looking after us. Would go back. ,4,2017,06,14
219,Great Location!!!,"Hotel was quaint. It is an older hotel and you can definitely tell. It is clean though. Location is great, close to many restaurants. Family room was a bonus. My kids didn't have to fight about sharing the same bed.üòä",3,2017,06,14
219,Loved this place!,"Great, affordable option in the city center of Dublin within a short walk to O'Connell st and across from Connolly station. Trendy but not pretentious. Loved the updated rooms with plenty of amenities to make your stay comfortable. The club lounge was a special treat and we spent a lot of time up there. Staff was responsive and helpful when we needed assistance with taxi services and our bags. Wished I would have booked this place again for our last night in Dublin!",5,2017,06,13
219,Amazing Staff,"My daughter and I have been fortunate enough to visit the North Star 3 separate times. It has been consistently clean, comfortable and lovely by design. However it is made most welcoming by the choice of staff working there. All the staff we have encountered are kind, patient and quick to help in any way. I reinjured an old back problem, the gentleman at the front desk summoned a doctor that showed up at my room in less than an hour, I regret not catching his name, I can't thank him enough. The hotel is directly across from Connoly Staion where you can ride the rapid transit up and down the gorgeous East coast of Dublin, to find amazing beaches, markets, shopping and great dining out. Convenient for walking to many great sites also.
    The hotel also has a pub and restaurant, the food is always fresh and delishous. However it is the staff again that make it such a welcoming place to be. Particularly want to mention Sean , easily the kindest and most professional person I have ever met. Aidan, David, Dominick, Keith and several more fine staff make this a fine running machine. Have dinner and a drink there, you won't be disappointed!",5,2017,06,12
219,Great deal!,"I booked only a week ago, however i booked via last minute dot com (some reason won't let me enter the website) ....after hours of looking at hotels, I decided to just go for a mystery hotel! The hotel is amazing, location is brilliant, staff are lovely! The bar is cheaper than a lot of bars in Dublin, which is unusual! Definitely recommend! ",5,2017,06,12
219,Very mixed ,"A really mixed experience here. High tech rooms have lots of problems: first one I was checked into had no power at all, was stumbling around with my iPhone torch. Eventually reception sent someone up to check who had even less of a clue about how to sort it out than I did. It was by now midnight and I was moved rooms. The new room had new problems including no wifi ( unlike normal hotels, this one has a unique wifi code for each room which you have to get via your TV: why is it all so complicated, just have easy wifi access) They struggled to explain that, and eventually  said they would move me again. Given it was now 1230 and I had to get up at 0600 I refused. Equally annoying is that when I checked out a couple of days later no one on reception seems to know or be interested in what happened to me. Just to be clear, everything in the rooms is powered, including the drapes which you can't have half closed: touch them manually and the electricity kicks in and opens or closes them fully even if you don't want it to. The final irony is that in the high tech high power consumption bathrooms there is the usual little card saying 'save the planet'! Save the planet! Try not to have everything relying on electricity then. The stars I have given are specifically for the bar/restaurant: decent food and very good staff in there. Elsewhere they don't seem to know what they doing and the rooms are more complicated than they need to be ",2,2017,06,11
219,Location is good,"This hotel is conveniently located close to the station however, this of course means you have the noise and hotel shaking from the trains. We were quite concerned when we got to our room and a train went past the window and thought we wouldn't get any sleep. Surprisingly once the window and the thick curtains are closed a lot of the noise is blocked. We slept fine. There's no lift up to the rooms so if you have mobility issues I'd go elsewhere, it was a struggle to get two large suitcases up there as well. On our final day and struggling down the stairs with the cases we were told we could've asked the porters to take them for us - make sure you do this. The buffet breakfast is very good and it was great to see a little table dedicated to Gluten Free options. You choose either continental or full, and they serve from 7-10am. The staff at the front desk varied from good to not so, one morning we were wanting to arrange and pay for a voucher for breakfast and the guy started looking after us, some ladies came down to checkout and he just stopped helping us to look after them and then passed us off to another staff member. The hotel itself looks tired and carpets look like they need a good clean. The breakfast was the best part along with the service staff at the restaurant at night. ",3,2017,06,11
219,"A totally surprising, disappointing let down.","I'm sorry to be one of these people but....
On arrival we were disappointed by poor customer care (I mean, we're in Dublin...the epitome of friendly, wonderful people). We were then directed to a room already occupied by somebody else (sussed this out by walking in on them, sorry guys!!). We were moved to another room, after a muttered apology (a requested quiet room...it was directly on the main road). The room is categorically not of 4 star standard, I regret now not paying the lesser mount and staying in ultimate City Centre, or a touch more and staying in luxury that little bit further out (a mere tram away). Trying not to be a grumpy dragon, I planned to chill myself in a lovely bath...the tap did not work as it 'said on the tin' (far from it, I even verified this by pleading with my fianc√© to check I wasn't just being a hysterical grouch). Once rectifying this, I laid in the bath...only to find that you cannot make any adjustment (or reach any of the products, without standing up!!)...needless to say, I was not relaxed. After this I was just at the point of being royally peeved when I realised there were not sockets by the bed and we were unable to manually lock the door...........flames out of my nostrils!!!!!! Over it...completely over it. Had a great day in Dublin, love the people, love the city, love the food, love the drink....just completely unfortunate I cannot stand our choice of shoddy hotel. Please do not select this place if you have any expectations. I paid that little extra for a romantic night....poor guy.",2,2017,06,10
219,Good location but non responsive,"No hot water the first morning.  Front desk said to leave the water running for 10 minutes which I already had.  Took cold showers, went down to the front desk and was informed they had problems with the water heater. Met other guests that did not have hot water since midnight .  When I came back at the end of the day and asked if the water heater was fixed, the desk had no idea what I was talking about.  Wi-FI was free but only worked intermittently",3,2017,06,09
219,A gem of a hotel in Dublin,"Very central location, great food at the restaurant, try the fish skillet I had it twice during my stay. The updated rooms in The Address part are for a seasoned traveller well thought out. Electronically managed, very roomy sized rooms, comfortable beds. The staff are super helpful and I love the decor. Had booked the lounge option but never got there as I was too busy, I will stay here again.",4,2017,06,08
219,Regular return,"Stayed for 4 nights last week in a premier room and as always everything great. Our room was at the back on the 5th floor no problem with no noise, and didn't miss the balcony which we had the last 2 visits as we just went up to the lounge where the views are wonderful. All the staff were so friendly couldn't do enough and when I requested a kettle for the room it came straight away. The breakfast was so good and again so impressed by the staff. We have seen the North Star change so much since our first visit in 2003 and as always look forward to our next stay",5,2017,06,08
219,Excellent - but a few flaws,"There are lots of positives about this great hotel - but there are a couple of flaws it's worth knowing before you book:

1. The hotel is located right on the rail track - view from my room is attached to give perspective. Trains pass frequently and cause a lot of noise. This won't suit a light sleeper.

2. The gym isn't great. I always like a decent gym on my business trips and the facilities here, actually available via the adjoining North Star hotel, has very dated equipment and poor air conditioning for a gym.

If you can overlook these two features, this is a great hotel. Here are some of the many positives:

1. Staff are incredibly helpful and polite

2. Food is good throughout - I had the Irish breakfast and room service dinner (which came speedily)

3. Rooms are clean and newly furnished. The bathroom is well-equipped and the complimentary soaps were nice.

4. The wifi is reliable in all areas of the hotel

Overall, a very pleasant stay.",4,2017,06,07
219,Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in,"We had to walk up two flight of stairs with Heavy suit cases.  The Room was roasting, know Air Con, if you opened the Window you had very loud road noise. Didn't get a wink of sleep all Night + the noise down stairs in the Bar whent on Utill  the early hours. We stopped in five Hotels in Ireland and every one was a very high standard and considerable cheaper we loved Ireland and the people,  all the Staff said put it on Trip-Advisor which iam doing. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.",1,2017,06,06
219,Optimum Stay,"I had been in a visit for a couple of days. I booked the Club king room which was just perfect with touch screens for everything, dedicated internet, tea/coffee, and complimentary access to lounge. The hotel is in a walking distance to city center. The stuff were helpful and understandable and assisted in checking in and few minutes late checkout. Overall pleasant stay and experience.

219,Great Hotel,"Very friendly staff, nice room (although we was next to the train track, bit loud and also the tv breaks up every time a train goes past lol). 
Shaun in the bar area is a credit to the hotel as well as the waitresses. Food was also top notch",5,2017,06,05
219,overnight stay,"I wanted a hotel close to concert venue for an overenight stay.  I'd stayed here many years ago and hadn't been impressed.  However, I could hardly fault it this time.  My only quibble was that the razer socket in the bathroom didn't work.  Hardly a great problem.  My room was at the back so this may have accounted for less noise in the room.  The staff I met were great and it's an easy walk to central Dublin locations.  i'd stay here again.",4,2017,06,05
219,Disappointing,"Delay to our flight meant arriving at 11.45pm.Reception from staff good very easy checking.There is where it goes wrong no lifts to our room in old part of hotel  So had to carry cases two flights of stairs .Room was so hot, no air conditioning small fan supplied but noisy.It was then I noticed this wasn't room I had booked. Went to reception first thing in the morning showed my paperwork to prove wrong room allocated staff apologised I asked how much for an upgrade to suite as I had checked availability was told 30 euro per night extra even though wrong room first night.Room would be available after 1pm.Returned room looked good, on top floor views amazing . Luckily for us we always travel with ear plug. Noise which I believe came from air con units on roof from vibration made for two more uncomfortable nights. I love Dublin all of Ireland if I'm honest people are always so friendly. Such a shame because I booked trip to celebrate my 50th birthday.",3,2017,06,03
219,Nice simple hotel,"The staff was more than helpful. The restaurant has great food. There is also a small sauna, next to the gym, which basic but has enough. It's pretty close to the city center and that is always nice to have.",3,2017,06,02
219,Just OK location and under contruction,"We stayed for 2 nights and did not love the location of the hotel.  The air conditioning was broken in both of the rooms in our group but the staff did provide a fan at 2am and had it fixed for our second night. Some of the electrical outlets were also not working.  The room was clean and very updated, but very small. It reminded me of a NYC hotel.  However, it was perfectly functional. We even had a king size bed, which is rare in Europe.  We thought the shower door was a bit strange since it is only covers a quarter of the tub and water goes all over the bathroom when taking a shower.  There was no curtain.  We had a view of a brick wall and construction began at 8am in the courtyard below with a jackhammer or drill of some sort.  I will say the staff was very nice and helpful.  The bar staff was also lovely.",3,2017,06,02
219,Lots of little annoyances.,"This property has been recently upgraded and it is much improved with a nice furnished and equipped large room by European standards. 

 The restaurant is also very good.

Nevertheless there are a few items that caused irritation.

First off there is no parking which is not unusual in Dublin but if it was available it would definitely be a plus. Otherwise a longish walk , at least 250 meters, to the train station parking lot is required.

 Also the drain in the tub was very slow resulting in ankle deep water while showering.

We booked on an online hotel website not  connected to the hotel and when we appeared for breakfast were told it was not included. The added charge was 12.50 per person for the hot food and 8.50 for the cold , not insubstantial amounts.

Then there is the elevator. We got on at 6 , went to 3 where others got on , went up to5 where nobody was, then down to 4 where nobody got on , then back up to 5 , etc, etc. All the while the lobby button was pressed and illuminated. 

This happened to us a year ago when we stayed here.

When I mentioned this to the young lady at the front desk she was totally uninterested. 

So all in all this is a decent place to stay but there are negatives and it's not a cheap stay either. 
",3,2017,06,01
219,Good hotel,"Very clean and fresh hotel with nice staff.
Bed was comfortable, room was clean and looked brand new. Very nice, new bathroom as well. 
The air-con worked great but it made quite a bit of noise. 
Our room was right by the train tracks but it wasn't a problem as we almost couldn't hear it. The noise from the air conditioning bothered us more so if you're sensitive to sounds that could be a problem. 
The view wasn't the best but we didn't see it as a problem for us.
Other than that it's a pretty good location, not too far from O'Connell street. 
Very happy with our stay!",5,2017,05,31
219,4 day stay,"Came back from here Sunday evening! Absolute fantastic place to stay! Wasn't expect such high tech! As young adults we didn't think we'd ever be able to afford to attend such an elegant place. 

Reception is absolutely lovely and all staff are welcoming and helped us both on arrival and departure! 

The room was to die for, absolute paradise! We had a fantastic view and fantastic use of facilities! 

Love the gadget system of having everything at the touch of a button! 

Only downfall was the train track being right underneath our room but got used to it after a while! Bed was lovely and so comfortable didn't want to get out of it most days

The hotel was extremely clean and the restaurant attached has a lovely range of food and not badly priced considering it's in Dublin! 

All in all fantastic stay, if I were to go Dublin again I'd definitely think about staying here! Well once I've got myself a mortgage.. Dublin is very expensive! ",5,2017,05,30
219,Mediocre Stay,"The staff are very friendly and helpful, but our room was less than desirable. We got a room in the older section of the hotel facing the street. It was quite loud with all the traffic noise. There is no elevator in this section of the hotel. The carpet in the hallway is quite dated. The room and bed is clean and comfortable enough. There seems to be a newer section at the rear section of the hotel, which seems nicer. It might be costing more or depending on how/where you make your reservation, this will determine if you get a room in the newer or older section of the hotel.",3,2017,05,30
219,Good stay,"Overall this was a good stay, the room was comfortable.  We really appreciated having a coffee machine which was a nice touch.  The shower was good, pressure was excellent.  The beds were clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was really good, lots of choices.  The lift was very slow though.",4,2017,05,30
219,"Zero complaints, which is rare for Dublin","I managed to grab a room at the introductory price (it first opened only two weeks before I stayed), and it looked exactly as advertised. The bed was incredibly comfy, the room was sleek and modern, and the touch panel controls were a treat. It's conveniently located across from Connolly Station (good for heading out of town) and only a three minute walk from Busaras and the Luas line, which can drop you off close to Temple Bar and runs until midnight.

I do wish the continental breakfast in the Club Lounge had been a bit more substantial (mini croissants don't really fill you up)  and that they had options for eating earlier than 7am (an issue all over the city, to be honest), since it often left me with no options and going hungry when I left for day tours. 

However, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and I honestly enjoyed my stay very much. Despite being next to a train line, the noise never bothered me, nor did I ever hear a peep from the other rooms. The rare ability to control the temperature of my room while in the British Isles was well worth it!

As a note: the bathrooms have rainfall showers, just in case that matters to anyone.",5,2017,05,29
219,Six day stay,"The room was fine and the service excellent and very very friendly,if  we had any complaint it would be that the doors to the rooms needed the door closers adjusted to avoid the constant slamming sounds , other than that a wonderful visit.
Stuart and Ann.",4,2017,05,29
219,Good Location,We went through a travel agency and they picked this hotel.  I am thankful it was very clean and convenient to the Hop-on Hop-off bus.  Staff was accommodating.  This was a good pick overall.  They offered breakfast but unfortunately our package didn't provide it.,4,2017,05,28
219,Perfect stay!,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights this week. We'd had an early flight so we arrived to drop our bags off around 3 hours before check in was supposed to start and were pleasantly surprised to be told our room was already ready for us! The staff were really friendly and so helpful in demonstrating how to use all the great technology the room had to offer, including controlling lighting and air con from the tv! The room was spotless and we were given complimentary crisps and chocolate in the fridge, along with great coffee and tea making facilities. Our package allowed us access to a lounge area where bottled water and coffee facilities were always on offer, along with a continental breakfast with a great selection on a morning. The tram runs next to the hotel but this was no issue for us at all, we only heard it once when we stood in reception checking in, we couldn't hear a thing from our room on the second floor. Whilst the hotel is located a slightly longer walk away from the main temple bar area than others may be, we enjoyed the walk each day as we always seemed to be passing street performers and taking in lots of culture that we may have otherwise missed! You can pick up a taxi right outside the hotel which was really useful when it came to visiting further away places such as the zoo. The attached restaurant was lovely and we spent a few nights in the hotel bar chatting to the lovely bar staff. Whilst we didn't use the gym or sauna these facilities were also on offer to us! Thank you for a great stay The Address, we would definitely return :)",5,2017,05,27
219,beautiful hotel,"great location, near to the city , great food, great room, everthing was great, the reception staff was very helpful, good for smoker, we make a hop on hop off tour recommended from the hotel- this was also beautiful, there was nothing to gripe",5,2017,05,26
219,All round brilliant,I'm a regular visitor to the North Star hotel and the food is always lovely and daily specials are great value and delicious too! Keith always goes out of his way to welcome you and look after you! Keep up the good work and looking forward to the new extension!,5,2017,05,25
219,North Star Hotel,"I booked this hotel via Orbitz as they were having a sale. It's a nice hotel in a nice location. There are many things that are walkable, and if you aren't able to walk most taxi rides in the city are cost effective (10 Euros or less within a couple of miles).

The reception staff was very helpful. I had booked a hop on hop off bus tour online and needed to print a voucher which they printed for me. I also had a couple of requests the first night I was here that they were very attentive to.

The things that weren't that great was that the hotel is a bit noisy, nothing terrible, but there seems to be some work going on at the hotel during the day.
Also, the water pressure in the shower is not good.

All in all it was nice enough that I was happy with my 3 days here.",4,2017,05,24
219,4 star ?? Not the shower,"This is a beautiful hotel and on first appearance, you would think so. Great rooms great location great food. But wait till you have a shower, there is barely enough water to get you wet. Water pressure is low, and even worse if the room next door is using water at the same time.
I complained to management who told be they looked at it but did nothing to rectify the situation. Upon checking out I voiced my opinion to the staff at the counter but he could not care less and did not acknowledge my complaint.
Give this place a big miss.",1,2017,05,23
219,Great location and hotel!,"Had a lovely stay the other night. The room was a good size, and the staff at the front desk were lovely. Comfy bed. It was a quick walk into the very middle of the city where O'Connell Street and Temple Bar are. 

I didn't have time to get the breakfast but I wish I did because they offer a continental breakfast for 12.50.",5,2017,05,22
219,A good hotel in a good location on north side,"We stayed in the older front section of the hotel. The room was large and clean but a narrow bath shower and no lift to the two floors may be a challenge for older people. Best to ensure you are booked into the rear hotel rooms.
Staff were very welcoming and helpful.
Breakfast was excellent with a range of choice up to full Irish breakfast.
Easy access to McGettigans restaurant for dinner and drinks which was excellent.",4,2017,05,20
219,Great hotel ,"Loved this hotel ideal for a great stay in Dublin. Slightly out the way but only a 15 min walk into the main part. Lovely decor inside and there's a few bits around it. Would defo recommend. I have stayed in some hotels in Dublin and this is one of the nicest and great great price too 
",4,2017,05,19
219,Very Good Stay,"The location of this hotel is very good. Most things are within walking distance and has the bus station and trams across street. 

Rooms on 7th floor include access to premier lounge, which is an excellent plus for free bottled water and cold breakfast items for those early days. ",5,2017,05,18
219,Great hotel in a great location,"Very impressed with this hotel especially for the price paid, more than brilliant value for money.
I arrived in Dublin early so went to the hotel and left off my bag and walked around for a bit and was tired so went back to the hotel to see if I could check in early and they said yes my room was ready and I could go on up (no extra charge for early check in) and also that the concierge would bring up my bag, what a great service.
The room was beautiful, the bed comfortable and also good facilities in the room with a good sized bathroom.

Only one fault with this hotel was the heat in the room, it was so warm and the radiators weren't on, even with the fan on (which was provided in the room) and the windows open it was difficult to cool down. Maybe the hotel could invest in some air conditioning?

On check in we were given vouchers for a glass of prosecco if you had your main meal in McGettigans bar so we decided to go for it. The food was lovely and the prosecco went down well. I had the ribs and my sister had the fish and chips, both meals were really good, lovely whiskey sauce on the ribs.

Overall this hotel is lovely, in a great location and I would definitely stay again.

Thanks to the North Star and staff for a lovely hotel experience in Dublin.

",4,2017,05,17
219,Excellent staff,"If you want a nice clean hotel which is central to everything Dublin has to offer, then this is a must stay at hotel.
The staff are more than helpful and polite. Breakfast is excellent also with the choice of continental or for a fee a full Irish which is very nice too. Stayed here twice now and will be staying again.
Even the weather was very good for us lol",5,2017,05,17
219,flying visit.....,"Hotel was easy to get to from ferry port, accross the road to connolly station for trains & buses. Hotel was ideal location for city access but far enough away from the noise of bars of temple bar. Staff were very friendly & helpful, food was very good & the rooms were large & comfortable",5,2017,05,17
219,VIsitors to Dublin,"This hotel has been upgraded and is very modern now. The rooms are spacious and clean. My daughters and friends stayed in the more expensive part(only rooms left) called the address and it is very modern. The hotel was lovely but the reception was a nightmare. From the minute they arrived there were problems with reception, they were given the wrong rooms, there was a problem with trying to pay, staff refused to listen to the customer.  The girls were even late for their own party over a mixup at reception. Maybe more training is required it is a busy hotel",3,2017,05,16
219,Long weekend in Dublin,Lovely clean hotel - so near to everything.  Such friendly staff.  Gluten free options available at Grill and breakfast (continental).  Only bad point - could do with separate toaster for gluten-free toast.  Apart from that a great base and will be returning to do everything we didn't have time for!!  We were upgraded to a Premier room and enjoyed the use of the lounge with its hot drinks/water.  Very comfortable beds.,4,2017,05,15
219,Our trip to Dublin,"Just home from 3 lovely days in Dublin. The north star hotel was perfect..clean..helpful and friendly staff at all times.

By far the highlight of our stay was the very friendly helpfull staff nothing was to much trouble , Keith behind the bar made our stsy with his sense of humour and advice on best places to visit as it was our first trip to Dublin . A big thankyou to everyone at the North Star hotel we will definatly visit again , only stayed 2 nights but we will be comiing back for a week and using North Star as our base to explore Ireland . All the best Adam Masson .",5,2017,05,14
219,"Funky hotel but pricey, lacks cleanliness and noisy","I had attended a meeting earlier in the year in the North Star Hotel, Amiens Street, Dublin and was struck by the funky layout of the hotel. The Hotel is close to Connolly Station for Trains to the North and South of the country plus the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit.) and Busaras (Bus Station) for regional bus services to all parts of the country. The Luas (Tram) also is within easy reach of this hotel. So all and all I thought it was a great place to put our heads down before my partner headed off the next morning by train.
The room allotted overlooked Amiens Street a busy thoroughfare, so was noisy and difficult to get a good night's sleep. Early morning brought refrigerated delivery trucks right outside our window, delivering merchandise to the hotel, with the noise of the cooler units whirring away.
There is no air conditioning in the room, so on a hot night the window couldn't 
be left open due to noise.
My partner who worked all of her life in the Hotel Industry noted that the duvet cover hadn't been laundered properly and was stained on one side. As it was late and we were tired after travelling we decided just to turn it over and put the soiled side facing up. 
Nice size bathroom however, the grouting between the tiles were filthy with body fats from showering, as you can see in the picture. I can never understand how accomodation services allow this to build up over the years without a maintenance programme to treat this offensive and disgusting sight.

On a positive note the bed was comfortable and the room was nicely decorated. Tea and Coffee facilities, nice size flat panel TV, Iron and ironing board, Safe all supplied. However, it hadn't got a fridge.
The rates at this hotel are not cheap and in my opinion are expensive for the standard supplied. I paid ‚Ç¨134 on a Hotel Website, but I have seen rates in and around ‚Ç¨200 quoted for this hotel, which is exorbitant pricing.
We had a snack in McGettigan's bar. Very good choice of lite meals, full meals and very good efficient and friendly service.
Again this hotel appears to have an opinion of it's standing in the industry with prices more fitting to a five star hotel. Charging ‚Ç¨7 for a glass of wine and ‚Ç¨3 for a small size,250ml  bottle of Coke.  I show a copy of the bill for a lite snack at ‚Ç¨30.50.",2,2017,05,14
219,The North Star now includes The Address - not to everybody's taste,"Having stayed many times at the North Star and found it an excellent hotel, I was surprised on a recent visit to find that I had been allocated a room in The Address - in effect a hotel within a hotel. It is a brand new wing, and very well appointed, but my room was literally two metres from the railway line. The double-glazed window could not be opened - it would have been too noisy - but the air-conditioning could not be controlled and the room was stuffy and too warm, and the fan could not be run quietly. The room was full of high-tech features and one in particular was annoying:  getting out of bed in the night - or even dangling an arm out of bed - caused low-level lighting to come on beside the bed and in the bathroom, and this disturbed my sleeping wife. The room came with a free continental breakfast in a small room dedicated to Address customers, and this was only acceptable because there were few guests; otherwise there would have been a scrum for space and the available food. Another grouse was about the high-tech drinks machines in the bedrooms which produced not very pleasant coffee and did not boil the water adequately for tea.",4,2017,05,12
219,Beautifully decorated hotel however a very noisy room,"This is really beautiful hotel and it is decorated to a really high standard. The hotel itself is much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. The reception staff are helpful and friendly. We got food in the restaurant which was delicious. We stayed here for a concert and it was only a 5 minute walk from the nearest dart location. 
However for such a beautiful hotel we must have stayed here while it was being renovated as we got a room whereby the decor was not of the same standard as the rest of the hotel, which is fair enough as if the hotel is being renovated that is to be expected. However our room was right above some construction work going on (which started very early i think around 8/8.30am) and we were also woken by the sound of the trains pulling in and taking off from Connolly station. I am a very heavy sleeper and the trains unfortunately woke me up. I tried to ignore it but had to get up. When were checking out i did try to say that the trains were very loud but it wasn't really acknowledged. Which was a pity as i would have returned upon a promise that we could be put in a better room.",3,2017,05,10
219,"Fine, needs autoclosers on doors","This hotel is a perfectly reasonable hotel, with friendly staff and good food. My main feedback would be that they need some decent auto-closers on their doors. Every door slams like it is in a gale! Clean rooms though and, like I said, cool staff. ",3,2017,05,08
219,"Lovely hotel, great visit! ","This is the 4th time we have stayed at the hotel and it's still a great place to stay its had a bit of a makeover since we last stayed so even better! Rooms are good and spacious and lots of amenities available I.e hairdryer, iron, toiletries 
Staff are really friendly and helpful will definitely be returning for a 5th time! ",5,2017,05,08
219,Tired Hotel,"Visited late April
Reception and staff courteous and efficient. Also very helpful on directions etc.
Had a room at the back of the Hotel.
Clean and spacious.
Now here comes the ""But""......
very tired old beds (Knobs on head board fell off !)
Cracked tiles in bathroom.
Poor ""retouch"" paint jobs!
No complimentary water.
carpets, had seen better days.
BUT
The breakfast was GREAT !
The hotel is refurbishing and given time, with the staff they have it will probably improve! (Leave another 20 minutes in the oven to finish off)",3,2017,05,08
219,"Looks beautiful and 4 star, but..","4 of us went on an overnight break here to see the sights of Dublin.  The hotel is in a good location for this.

The room was a little tired, one of the beds was like a boat it had that much of a dip in the middle. 

I thought it was strange that there was no fan in the bathroom, considering 4 of us were sleeping in the room = 4 showers. 

There was  at least two hen/stag parties in at the same time so beware of that. 

We didn't have breakfast so can't comment.

Wifi is good, there is a bar joined to the hotel which you can get food in. 

You can also leave your luggage here if it is time to check out and your flight is not until much later. 

All in all, good base for a sight seeing hol, i would not class as 4 star though. 
",3,2017,05,07
219,good hotel with walking distance to Three Arena,"Booked this hotel as it was within reasonably walking distance to Three Arena and with best value around. It's nothing special but it's not bad as well. Staff was helpful, room was clean. There is no parking you will have to drive around to find something. Would recommend if you are attending any event at Three Arena.",4,2017,05,04
219,Business Trip,"I have been staying at the North Star Hotel for the last two weeks in one of their new ""Address"" rooms. I have to say I was blown away by the standard of the room and how modern everything is. Everything can be controlled via the smart t.v or by electronic touch pads including the air con and lighting. The king size bed and down pillows is just what you want after a long days work and the views from the room provide almost a birds eye view of Dublin City. With private access to the Club Lounge on the 7th floor it is a great place to relax and read a book while enjoying a complimentary coffee/tea. Staff at reception have to be complimented on their helpfulness and overall friendliness. I would recommend the North Star Hotel to anyone whether on a business trip or with family/friends. The hotel is up there among one of the top places to stay while in Dublin and is definitely my preferred choice.",5,2017,05,04
219,North Star,"Nice, clean friendly hotel. Staff was very accommodating and it is walking distance to all the main attractions. Connolly station is right across from this hotel. Highly recommend it. Reception in this hotel is very attractive ",4,2017,05,04
219,Terrible hotel - terrible stay,Staff were rude throughout. Room wasn't cleaned. ALARMS WENT OFF IN THE ROOM FROM 1am FOR AN HOUR. Phone to call reception didn't work - when I finally spoke to someone they were rude. There are plenty of nice hotels in Dublin - stay there.,1,2017,05,02
219,Excellent ,"Was upgraded to a premium room which was lovely! Bed very comfortable, shower was great and coffee machine was great to have although we struggled to work out how to use it! Reception is lovely, staff are friendly and is located around 10-15 mins from temple bar. ",5,2017,05,01
219,Fantastic place to stay,"Reda previous reviews about external noise, yet we did not experience this. Sound of a slamming corridor door too early in the morning, but that's due to clumsy guests and not much the extremely helpful staff could do about it. 
Staff were lovely and could not be more friendly, and the bar was great. 
Only stayed for one night, but would certainly go back and stay for longer.",5,2017,05,01
219,Easter weekend ,"A very confusing time.
The hotel calls itself "" The Address "", but only the people who work there, know this, because outside it is called the North Star Hotel.
We were standing almost outside, and a couple of locals didn't know where The Address was.
Inside, the hotel is lovely, the rooms, spacious and comfortable, but they have a very confusing card key system. You have a card to get you into the lift, and into your room, but it won't let you into the gym, a tea and coffee lounge on the top floor, or the breakfast room.
 Also, not a good time to have a weekend away, in Dublin, at Easter.
On Good Friday you can't buy any alcohol unless you are in a restaurant, with food in front of you. Even the mini bar in the hotel had been stripped bare.",4,2017,05,01
219,Fantastic stay ,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels in my time and the North Star has been one of the best! The room was phenomenal spacious, clean and so incredibly comfortable and the technology was particularly impressive. All staff were so friendly and helpful. The breakfast in the restaurant was fantastic and check in was seamless. The lobby was beautiful and I had high hopes before I even entered my room. I would travel to Dublin again just to stay in The North Star Hotel. It was fantastic!!! ",5,2017,04,30
219,Amazing!!,"Room new, bright and looks really upmarket. Lights and curtains and do not disturb etc all controlled by a panel. TV didn't work for part of the trip but wasn't too much of an issue as we weren't there to watch it really anyway. Highly recommend ",5,2017,04,30
219,"Fire! Fire!? No, just another false alarm...","For the first time ever, my wife joined me on a business trip. We arrived on Tuesday and tried to check in. Apparently the hotel was overbooked, because the receptionist was unable to find our room. We offered to let the man sort it out while we went into the restaurant to have lunch. This is the second time I stayed at the North Star, and I know their restaurant is very good. My junior colleague who traveled with us (but alone) also tried to check in. He was more persistent. While my wife and I looked at the menu, my colleague was upgraded to the James Joyce Suit. After our lunch, we got a room on the top floor (as we had reserved a premium room), but why did the receptionist not upgrade the couple who tried to check-in just before? Hmm...

Alarms were ringing as we reached the 7th floor. Should we evacuate? The cleaning staff on the floor were relaxed and told us 'probably not', and smiled.

The hotel is clean, and the breakfast is quite good. However, the breakfast room is in the cellar with no windows. 

The beds are very good in this hotel. Water pressure is low and it is difficult to set the right temperature in the shower. Many small things need a bit of maintenance, like the shaving mirror. For my previous stay, I first had a room with a loud 50hz hum that came on in ten minutes intervals. Then they agreed to let me have another room.

Television appears to be from an aerial: only national stations, and the picture is a bit grainy. 

On Thursday, my wife tried to take a nap. There was a lot of construction noise from the next door building. Multiple fire alarms went off. The reception told my wife that the dust from the construction had set off the fire alarm. So how would she know if there is a real fire, she asked. ""Then we will knock on the doors"" was the reply.

Friday, just minutes after midnight, we were awoken by another fire alarm. No dust from the construction this time, as the workers weren't there at midnight... Should we panic and run out? The alarm went silent after twenty seconds. 

1:29 AM another alarm for ten seconds. Ten minutes later, a third alarm. At around 2 AM yet another one.. I went down to the reception, to find out that the alarms were false, doors would be knocked on if there was a real fire, and an engineer would sort out the problem within two hours...

Now, I do understand that electronic things break. We had experienced many false fire alarms throughout our stay, and the management of the hotel didn't bother to figure out that there was a real problem before the midnight disaster struck. Construction dust shouldn't trigger a fire alarm, but if it does then it's a sign that the alarm sensors might be getting a bit flaky. 

Upon check-out, I asked for the premium breakfast fees for me and my wife to be waived. My request was obliged, but shouldn't the receptionist have volunteered some remedy for our interrupted sleep without me asking for it?

The location of this hotel is very good, although the immediate surrounding area is quite run down. All in all, I will not be back at the North Star anytime soon. The owners of this hotel will have to decide: either lower the rates or spend some money on upkeep and maintenance. At the current rates, the experience doesn't meet the expectations. ",1,2017,04,30
219,Never again,"First I would like to start with the positives. The reception area is beautiful. Old stone work and leather chairs mixed with modern decor. The staff were curtious and friendly. However, the standard of their rooms let them down here. Air conditioning did not work at all. I called down to reception and they promptly sent someone up. He looked at it and said he would be back with another maintainence person. This did not happen (perhaps they arrived after we went out) and when we got back nothing had changed. I called down again and was told that the maintainence person was busy and would we like a fan for the night while we waited. We got the fan but no one showed to fix the air con. Other problems included the shower head being loose, the shower pressure being off and the shower door leaking on to the ground. Poor plastering throughout and for the price I paid, would've expected at least a properly working shower. The public areas of the hotel seem immaculate and it is unfortunate that the rooms are not up to standard. We will not be returning.",2,2017,04,30
219,Very nice holiday,"I liked everything, the staff were very kind and helpful and some speak Portuguese, the room was quite comfortable. The hotel is well located, close to supermarkets and public transport, just 15 minutes walk from the center.",5,2017,04,30
219,Avarage stay,"We stayed in the suite at this hotel and the room is beautiful but located on top of train tracks? The room is large and modern with the beautiful bathroom and comfortable bed but with noise from trains passing every 5 minutes, with no option of small/soft pillows and with security that goes into the extreme part. Why would you have the hair dryer chained to the drawer beneath the cafeteria? Haw hygienic is to blow my hair on top of the mugs and coffee machine? I tell you...is disgusting. Plus if you want to chain an heir dryer as you are afraid someone will rob it, put a longer chain! I had to kneel to reach the hairdryer to my head! The same with the iron being chained to the table. The chain is so small it makes ironing a great challenge!

Tip - if you customers book a room for 3 days, don't take them out after 2 days because you overbooked the rooms! Give priority to your guests not on the potential extra earning from the new guests 

Plus side - pizza for room delivery was nice and so was the reception girl 

Wouldn't stay here again",2,2017,04,27
219,Mixed review,"     Hotel it's self is nice but we did have problems.  First our tour company had reserved two rooms and they only had one when we arrived. They were able to get us all in a family suite, but for an 80 euro charge.  It was Sunday so had to wait to contact our travel agent about this and we should be receiving a refund.  
     As far as the noise people have mentioned in other reviews, it would only be a problem for very light sleepers. Parking is a short walk away and there is no where to drop off bags, which would only be a problem for those with physical limitations. 
      Room was very nice, comfortable bed, good shower.  Staff was very accommodating.  Breakfast was a full Irish and was included in our package. ",3,2017,04,27
219,Recent weekend stay,"Beautiful modern hotel with plenty of original features.  

Reception is stylishly presented with plenty of check in staff available.  

We stayed in room 567, which was spacious, clean and modern.  Recently fitted bathroom, with plenty of complimentary toiletries.  Maid arrived daily to clean the room.  Our room was nice and quiet with no noise audible from the near by tram station.  

As our room was one of the hotels premier rooms, we enjoyed the use of the premier lounge located on the 7th floor, giving good views of the city.  Premier lounge users benefit from a small choice of continental breakfast which is set out each morning in the lounge and was a nice touch.

We only had a snack and some drinks in the hotels bar/restaurant so can't comment on the main menu, although the snacks and drinks that we had were very nice, and reasonably priced.  The bar has a very nice, relaxing atmosphere.",4,2017,04,26
219,Nice holiday but staff to be desired. ,"Me and my wife went to Dublin for a couple of days. The room we stayed in was lovely and couldn't knock it! The hotel itself was nice but still some unfinished areas. I upgraded our room based on the fact we had access to the terrace but got told when we checked in that it was closed! Really not happy with that as that's one reason I paid for the upgrade. 
The bit that lets the hotel down the most is the staff. I've never been to a hotel and experienced such bad service. The staff never said hello as we walked passed reception throughout our stay. We once walked past with 3 people behind the desk and not one looked up. When we checked in the gentleman never even looked up from his computer either. The hotel staff are a massive selling point for any hotel but it's massively failed at this hotel. ",3,2017,04,24
219,Weekend trip to Dublin,"The North Star Hotel is very modern from reception right the way through to the rooms. We stayed in room no 542 on the 5th floor, very contemporary decorated and all lighting and air con worked off electronic system. The TVs set up to welcome you and provides you with the room wifi access code. Very secure hotel as all points to access lifts and room levels are triggered by your individual guest card! On our visit we had 24 hr access to the club lounge. Tea coffee and continental style breakfast available, also a open air access to views of the buildings surrounding it. There is a rail line directly behind but this wasn't very noticeable and caused no disturbance to our sleep. Also hot drinks provided and a fridge in the room. Toiletries provided and fresh towels. Very clean hotel and friendly staff. I would recommend this hotel. About 10 min brisk walk into the city centre, so good location.",5,2017,04,23
219,Interesting Experience ,"When our travel agent booked this hotel for us, we realized that it was in an old building and was located across from the train station. We were prepared for the noise of traffic and the train as well as the character that comes from older buildings. We had three rooms for two nights each. One of our rooms was located directly above the speaker in the downstairs restaurant, which played until 12am. We dined in the restaurant (it was delicious) but the music was the same volume in the room as it was in the restaurant. Breakfast was fine- nothing seemed to be as fresh as the other hotels we have stayed in in Ireland. At breakfast, a group of older men who were clearly not staying in the hotel snuck into breakfast. They had piles of food on their plates and were rude to the waitress. They were loud and disorderly but were not asked to leave. On our last night, there was a domestic violence incident in the room next to ours. We called the front desk, and were told 'thank you for letting us know,' but nothing stopped. It was evident from the noises that things were being thrown and broken. 

Overall, it was a fine hotel stay. The rooms were clean and updated. They did provide hair dryers, which was a plus because many other hotels do not. Also, there were outlets right next to the bed which was perfect for charging our phones. If we find ourselves back in Dublin, we probably would not stay here again because of the experiences we had. It is a charming older building but does seem to draw a different crowd than we are used to. ",3,2017,04,22
219,Adequate - just,"I have to give a bad review of this hotel due to the room I was allocated. 
I was given a standard double room on the ground floor at the back of the hotel, which I thought would be relatively quiet. Bad mistake:

- room was dark and small, only 13 m squared (11 ft x 10 ft excl the small hall and bathroom) with a low ceiling. It felt rather claustrophobic. Warm and stuffy (in April). Quite different from the photos on the hotel's website, as other reviewers have said. There is no excuse to only show your very best rooms for which you have to pay a premium (this room cost ¬£100 per night which is expensive enough). I suppose the hotel would respond by saying I could have asked to be moved, but that misses the point. 

- the main problem was that the room looked out onto a side street, along which a significant number of vehicles and pedestrians travelled making continual noise, to 3am!  Due to the stuffiness of the room, the window had to be opened for much of the time. And as people and traffic were passing just 3 feet away, unless you are happy with strangers looking at you through the window lying on top of your bed, then the curtain had to be permanently closed, making the room feel even more depressing. For once, I was not looking forward to returning to the hotel after a busy day sight-seeing.

- very small bathroom, one of the smallest Ive used in a hotel.

- constant humming sound, not from the air conditioning (which was quite loud when used).

-  exposed electric box in corner of room.

- small TV in the corner with only about 8 channels. Reception was just ok, with noticeable lines on the picture. 

It seems, looking at other reviews, there isnt a single room available in this hotel without considerable noise to put up with, from traffic, trains or people, day and night. The opposite of what travellers want.

Would I stay here again? NO. Never.",2,2017,04,22
219,Lovely hotel,This hotel was very good. Our rooms were clean with regular maid visits. The staff were helpful and polite. We found it quite modern and close to amenities such as shops and train station and the food was excellent in mcgettigans cookhouse and bar ,5,2017,04,20
219,Nice little find!,"Booked this as a surprise for my girlfriend along with another couple. Was a bit unsure as it is a brand new hotel so no reviews etc.
On arrival our taxi driver was unsure of the location, however my friend did a bit of research and found it is actually located at the North Star Hotel.
Check-in was smooth and simple, they actually let us check-in at 10am, although it stated 2pm on our booking. My friend had emailed ahead and asked for rooms together and a little surprise for my girlfriend (card and balloons). We were took to our room by a porter who explained the hotel was very new, lift access was only allowable with our room key. We were on the 5th floor, rooms are very modern - touch buttons for lights and curtains opening/closing. Wi-Fi is accessed via your TV with your unique code.
Others have mentioned the lights under the bed if you need the bathroom in the middle of the night which is a nice touch.
Good location only a 15 minute walk to temple bar and O'Connell street.

Only tip is make sure you tell taxi driver North Star Hotel Ameins Street, otherwise they won't know it!",5,2017,04,19
219,Staff issues,"Located directly across from Connolly station and accessible to taxis. Booked a room for 4 people which really could have been larger. Residents bar was questionable, bar staff stated bar was closed at 12am, then seemed to reopen a while later.. Awoken the following morning to renovation works at 8am with no due warning.... Payment due up front which really annoys me aswellm as any person is entitled to experience the service  before committing to payment.... wifi didnt work also",3,2017,04,17
219,Best hotel,Best hotel I've stayed in in Europe the decoration was lovely it was clean and tidy the food in the restaurant was delicious I have no bad things to say about this hotel and if we ever go back to Dublin this is where I will be staying! Keep up the good work. ,5,2017,04,17
219,Easter weekend ,"We visited this hotel on Easter Sunday and have to say first impressions were very good, staff very friendly and reception area was lovely. Rooms were clean and tidy, would stay again. Only negative was it was very noisy as we were beside the tram line and rooms were very warm, if you opened the window it was very hard to get a good nights sleep. Next time we would ask to stay in another area of hotel, Other than that all good! ",4,2017,04,17
219,North Star Hotel,Very modern hotel in a great location in Dublin city centre near bus and train station. Rooms are great and service excellent! Emily O'Grady was of great help and an absolute delight. Looking forward to my next stay,5,2017,04,15
219,Front desk,Had wonderful customer service from the front desk by Emily O'grady. Would highly look forward to coming back to this location because of her. She was able to help us with directions to all of our locations and also advise us on the best local attractions to see!,5,2017,04,15
219,"Lovely hotel, but a little noisey","Myself and 3 friends stayed here in a family room for a girly weekend to see Ed Sheeran. It is directly opposite Connelly Street Station and is near a variety of eatery's, pubs and shops.It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the 3 arena as we walked back from our show. We arrived early by about 45 minutes but were checked in immediately. Check in was efficient and the receptionist, Daniel was lovely and a shining example of good customer service. The lobby was stunning and had a great atmosphere.

Our room was on the 3rd floor. It had plenty of space for 4 women and a lot of luggage and was very clean and decorated in a modern fashion. The double bed was very comfortable but the 2 singles beds seemed to be at a bit of a slant or something just wasn't quite right with them. The room had a TV and an Iron and Ironing board. The bathroom was clean but not just as modern as the room itself. The Bar staff were obliging when we cheekily asked for a bucket of ice and some wine glasses for our room and engaged in some fun banter. The concierge was also very helpful and hilarious! 

We decided to have breakfast in the morning and for 12.50 euro there is a buffet style fully cooked breakfast, a wide variety of cereals and juices, pastries, fruit salad, yogurts, cold meats and cheeses. It was all delicious and the lady who seated and served us was very cheerful and helpful.

We again were checked out quickly and efficiently. We asked if they could store our bags and they did so and gave us a ticket. We collected them with no problems. 

I have dropped a star because there was a lot of loud building work or something of that nature which started outside our window at about 5.30am which obviously woke us. As well as this I went down to reception to ask to have some money changed and some other pieces of information when there were 4 members of staff behind the reception desk. Not one of them acknowledged me when I approached the desk and the gentleman who did eventually help me was less than engaging and made sure to do the bare minimum he had to. 

But all in all a fantastic stay with mostly lovely staff.",4,2017,04,15
219,Great 4 day city break,This was a xmas present from my partner...loved Dublin and enjoyed the time we had there. Great pubs and brilliant atmosphere in each one we went in. Went on the hop on hop off bus and visited many sites. Drinks are expensive but that did not put a downer on our trip. Would re visit againüòäüòä,5,2017,04,14
219,"Centrally located hotel, but not as nice as the pictures","My friend booked this hotel as he found a deal on booking.com for 1 night. The hotel was centrally located, which was its' best feature. The bathrooms were nice, but the ceilings had cracks running through. The room was very spacious, but you could hear lots of noise from the street, which is the price you pay for convenience.",3,2017,04,11
219,Nice hotel/but too close to tram line! Very noisy,"We've just stayed here for two nights, hotel was nice , rooms were not as nice as looked on pictures but still nice. 
We checked in dropped out bags off and went out, didn't get back till late that night - as we tried to get to sleep we couldn't as the room was boiling but we couldn't have the window open because we was right next to the tram line and even with the window closed it was so loud. But with it being almost midnight - was far too late to pack and swap rooms.
Again the next night was just as bad so didn't get much sleep for two nights, with trams running every 10 mins Till late and again first thing in morning. 
Overall good location, nice food in the restaurant . 
Would probably stay again in this hotel but would request a different floor. Not right next to tram line!! 
Was quite overpriced considering. 
If we had a different room would have given better rating.",3,2017,04,09
219,DO NOT BELIEVE THE PICTURES,"Guess I should start off on a high note, the hotel is central and next to a tram station so it was easy to get places and there were places to get food nearby. But now where do I begin, me and my boyfriend came for a long weekend away to Dublin and I specifically picked this hotel because the rooms looked good quality and it had everything we needed included. Well I couldn't have been more wrong. The rooms look NOTHING like the pictures which I was extremely disappointed about as it was the main reason I booked this hotel which was not cheap either. We didn't bring a hair dryer as it said that it was included in the room, which it was but it was stuck in the draw and you couldn't get it out as it was attached to the wall so you had to crouch down on your knees if you actually wanted to use it. The TV remote was sticky and could only manage to switch on the TV as the other buttons didn't work. The shower literally dribbles out water so it takes you 10 times as long to use it and the glass panel for it doesn't shut properly so the floor gets soaked. The maids don't knock on the door for your room, they just waltz in so we had to lock the door every time we were in the room. On the first day when we came back into the room after being out, the maids had took one of our key cards (which we never got back) that we needed to keep in the room to keep the air con on, so the room was boiling when we came back in and then we then only had one key card between us. When we ordered room service (where the food is extremely over priced to start with) the waiter came to the room and was very rude and charged us an extra 5 euros for ""the tray"" which we were never told about either! The maids do not clear your food tray out your room either so it was still there the next day (even though they'd been in the room) so we had to ask someone to take it out for us. There were drills going off outside the room at 7:30am every morning which were extremely loud and woke us up and to top off this experience the fire alarm went off at around 2am on our last night when we had to be up early for a flight home, for no apparent reason then went back off after a couple of minutes. Would not advise anyone to book this hotel as it is EXTREMELY deceiving and I'm so disappointed as I thought I'd booked a lovely hotel. DO NOT believe the pictures!! ",1,2017,04,09
219,Nightmare Hotel,"I have just checked in and I'm surprised of the bad treatment and room I have.
The room is really really different from the photos you could find on the web and is very small in comparison to the price and my expectations!! There is no mini bar, the staff is not friendly at all, I'm not so sure also about the cleanliness and WiFi works only for the first minute. What a terrible experience ... ",1,2017,04,08
219,My mother 70th,"My mum suffers with MS and we took her to Ireland for a girly weekend to celebrate her 70th birthday. I can not express how kind the staff all were and how well they treated us. My mum felt like the queen from the moment she walked in. 
Staff very friendly and helpful, so kind. Thank you for making it so relaxing and special. ",5,2017,04,07
219,Impressive,"I have stayed here recently during the week. The bedrooms are brand new (yeay!) and spacious & bright. The room is equipped with this hi-tech panel with which you can manage lights, curtains etc. It's a cool facility to have, definitely something different. It's nice to just wake up and with a touch of a button you can open the curtains and enjoy the day (if it's sunny).

There is a rain shower head in the bathtub which is my favorite and what I also noticed is that the mirrors don't fog up after steamy shower and that's great if you want to do your make up right after having the shower without having to wait.

I didn't use the TV so much, however I noticed when you turn it on there is an option to order room service from your TV. Again a cool facility if you're up for using it. 

Lastly (and this was discovered just by accident) I had to get up to the bathroom in the middle of the night and this light came on under from under the bed! Thought that was a nice idea especially if you don't know where you are and where to go to the bathroom (just when you wake up for a second!).",5,2017,04,07
219,Great service,"We arrived at the hotel very early and didn't expect to be able to check in but we could and so were in our room for 8.30am.
After seeing the pictures in the face book page We were disappointed with the room as it was small and on the ground floor where he view was in to a storage facility full of junk!
Later my husband took a shower and realise that it was actually hanging off the wall and the water was coming out like it would from a hosepipe!
We phoned reception and they were most helpful and moved us to a nearby suite!  This was larger and had a slightly better view and more space!
We had drinks in the bar but when I asked for some of the cocktails I had seen on Facebook I was told they were just for show and weren't real which was really disappointing as they looked amazing and I had been looking forward to sampling them!
We didn't take breakfast at the hotel as we could find this cheaper elsewhere but the food in the restaurant looked lovely!
Location is great, central and can be easily found by looking for the large spire on O'Connel Street and walking up the street next to it!
I would definitely return but would request a room on a higher floor to benefit from the views over the city!
",4,2017,04,07
219,Fab. Friendly. My New 'Must-Stay-Destination',"I discovered the North Star Hotel on Amiens Street Dublin by accident and what a happy accident that was! I stayed in the new block known as ""The Address"". It's high tech, ultra modern and I had a great view of the city. Plus for me a great location close to the Docklands emerging development. The hotel is spotless. The staff are ultra friendly and efficient especially David from South Africa who works in the bar. He's a gem; an asset to any establishment. I returned within a week  and this time took my daughter with me on my business trip. This fabulous hotel will now be my 'Must Stay Destination'",5,2017,04,06
219,Wonderful hotel ,"We arrived at the hotel early in the morning but we were able to check in which was great. At first we were put in a room on the ground floor which was a basic older room but still very clean, but as I don't like to stay on the ground floor we asked to be moved up and asked for a newer room, at first they were giving us the same room but on the 2nd floor however they decided to give us a newer room on the 6th floor which was absolutely beautiful. The bed was very comfy and the room was spotless. It was a 10-15 min walk from temple bar and close to O'Connell street, also the tram is very close by to reach the Guinness factory and kilmainham Gaol. Staff were also lovely! Would definitely return. ",5,2017,04,05
219,Thank you! A wonderful evening; amazing staff.,"We stayed at the North Star Hotel for our first evening in Dublin. It was a brief stay as we were off early the next morning before 7:00 AM. The staff was fantastic! It was our first time in Ireland, so we were a little unsure about how to get from one place to another and we had to be at the rail-station early the next morning. The hotel staff was great! They arranged a cab, made sure we had a breakfast to go waiting for us, and gave excellent tips as to where to spend our first evening. Thank you!",5,2017,04,05
219,Great place to stay,"Great place to stay!  Everyone was very nice and helpful. The only problem I had was, Daniel at the front desk for somewhat rude at times. The room was very clean. The maid service for excellent. The room was clean promptly every morning.  ",4,2017,04,02
219,North Star Hotel Dublin / Ireland,"My family and I traveled to Ireland in February for a week. The hotel we booked was under construction and we were sent to the sister hotel: North Star Hotel on Amiens st.in Dublin. We were upset after taking cab to 1st hotel but after getting to the North Star Hotel we were extremely happy during our week! Very friendly, courteous and professional staff at this hotel. Front desk staff and restaurant staff excellent! Loved the location, walking distance to everything! Took three tours and saw a wee bit of Ireland. Loved it! The Irish Tea was excellent! Never had a Guiness that was so smooth, every bar / pub served it properly!",5,2017,04,01
219,Totally overated and overpriced,"The Address is actually North Star Hotel, but the ""renovated"" wing. 

It is decent, and good located, but under no circumstances can you call it a 4 star hotel and charge almost 200 EUR/night for such a room. In my opinion it is a 3 star hotel worthing around 100 EUR/night, and this due to location not the room quality. 

Good things:
1. location
2. the smart controls of the room (lights, curtains, etc. control). 

Bad things: 
1. Although newly renovated, you see everywhere the poor quality of the materials (the furniture is made out of the cheapest fiberboard, or at least this is the impression I got)
2. The bathroom look and utilities. For example, you only have a ceiling shower and no hand held shower head.
3. No minibar
4. the hairdryer is tied inside of a cupboard with a small cord, making it very hard to be used
5. I asked for a electricity plug adaptor and I was charged for it. 
6. The funnies thing is that The Address has not a complete address on websites (not even on tripadvisor). Therefore, it took the taxi quite a while to locate the hotel on Amiens street, because they do not tell you that it is the North Star Hotel, the name ""The Address"" is not mentioned on the buildings. We managed to find it only after we called, and the receptionist told us that they are actually the North Star Hotel.",2,2017,04,01
219,Excellent location,"We stayed in the older section of the hotel. If you want lavish luxury and technology, it's not for you.  If you want a comfortable place near everything in Dublin, this is it.  It's a ten minute walk to just about everywhere.  Both the train and buses run right near and the staff....especially the concierge....are especially friendly and helpful.  When we come back to Dublin, North Star is at the top of the list.",5,2017,04,01
219,Great Value!,"North Star has a great position if you are a traveller. Opposite Connolley Station and five minutes from the set down for Airlink- Dublin Airport to Dublin City. This makes for great ease when travelling. The hotel itself is wonderfully designed inside- do not be put off by the exterior. The room we had was large with a great Queens Size bed. The bathroom had a shower and bath with good quality soaps etc. There is a great bar and the restaurant is far superior to many- it was always really busy each night. The bar staff and waiting staff are wonderful- cheerful, great humour and always willing to make sure everything is fine. The breakfasts are plentiful with a good range of hot and cold offerings- again the staff there are great- polite and willing to help. Reception staff are equally great and go out of their way to help as does the concierge who does a god line in Irish humour. The location just north of the Liffey means there is a little walk, ten to fifteen minutes to O'Connell Street where you can get the hop on and hop off buses. We stayed for four nights and always remarked upon what a lovely hotel it was and what wonderful staff they had. A great stay!",5,2017,04,01
219,Nice Hotel,"The staff was welcoming and the lobby was unique. It's part of the train tunnel which is nearby, but was not very noisy. The rooms had a double and two twin beds, which was just about all the rooms could manage. The bathroom was small. Our room had very low water pressure in the shower which was inconvenient sharing a room with 4 people. The showers took longer. We had a room at the end of the hall and one of the twin beds was right in front of the closet, making it very inconvenient to use. The only place large enough to open our luggage was in the entryway or on the beds. So we just kept our clothes in the luggage & had to move them daily. The air conditioner in our room also did not work. We tried to turn the fan up just to promote air circulation, but was ineffective. You can open the windows, but unfortunately the street noise and lots of construction at the time made it too loud to keep open at night & early mornings. The staff was accommodating and friendly. They held our luggage until we left for our flight in the afternoon. Had we researched it better, we would have liked to be closer to the Temple Bar area, although the walk was manageable and we may have missed many of the sites had we been closer. The restaurant and bar was very nice. They did have a sauna that we used & was nice. The gym area was clean & well kept.",3,2017,03,29
219,Restaurant superb,"Very handy hotel if you are taking an early morning train from Connolly.A little blip on check in as they had booked me in to a family room even though I had booked a double room but the issue was well dealt with and  I ended up in a large room with a very comfortable bed.Nice bathroom.

The restaurant is superb,tasty food,very good service 

A minor point as I don't normally watch TV but the reception was woeful",4,2017,03,29
219,"nice hotel, reasonable price","I stayed there for 2 nights. It's close to train station but I didn't hear anything in the hotel room. I stayed on the top floor (7 floor). The hotel room is nice and spacious, the staff is helpful. It has a nice restaurant inside the hotel and also open to outside.",4,2017,03,27
219,Great service and comfy rooms,We had a great experience at North Star Hotel. Daniel at the front desk was particularly helpful in getting us set up with a tour outside the city. When we arrived we received two vouchers for a complimentary glass of prosecco in the bar (which we thoroughly enjoyed). Wifi was free of charge and the breakfast buffet included was delicious. Would recommend!,5,2017,03,27
219,Fantastic Hotel .. worth every penny / Euro,Paddy's Day weekend ..  what a mobnster of a weekend and a need to book early Hotel but if you get in at the right money this is a place that does not let you down .. Immaculate rooms providing the view is to your liking .. superb staff ... great rocking Bar ... and the food was fgirst class .. could not really fault this fine establishment for location ... ease of access and overall comfort .. ,5,2017,03,27
219,Not worth 4 Stars; very dissapointing,"I have to say that I am quite disappointed with my stay at this hotel. Although it has some positive points overall I don't think it meets the standards for a 4 stars hotel.

I made two separate bookings, one night for a single person for business and then a double room for the weekend for two people. The 1st night I was given a room in the old side of the hotel (No. 104, if I remember correctly) and it wasn't a pleasant night at all. Placed on the 1st floor with windows towards a very busy road, the windows are not isolated at all which resulted in having a lot of noisy during the whole night. I am not a light sleeper at all but had problems during the whole night. Also the rooms are rather old on that side of the building.

For the second part of my stay, I was placed in room 443 in the new area. We had one of the premier rooms with access to the Premier Club Hospitality Lounge. Nice addition but certainly not worth the quite expensive fares the hotel charges. The breakfast was mediocre at best and in the cellar, so not a very nice place.

With regard to the room, it was very new, comfortable bed, all touch screen with your own wifi router in the room. Again the room faces the train track so very noisy every time a train goes by and the super modern intelligent lights turn on alone when someone wakes up to go to the toilet. Although it's true they don't light up completely and supposedly should provide help in reaching the toilet, the truth is that they are too bright and meant that the other person woke up every time some went to the toilet during the night.

Another bad thing was that they don't have adapters to borrow but rather charge you to buy them (which for the price of the hotel and being a 4 star, they should in my experience).

Finally we also did not have hot water on Saturday when we tried to have a shower before leaving the hotel at around 10 am or so.

Only positive thing is that it's easily reachable from the airport with Airlink (less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel) and it's a nice 15min walk to the center of Dublin.",3,2017,03,27
219,Great stay in Dublin,"My girlfriend and I recently stayed at The Address in Dublin and were very extremely pleased with the hotel, after having some doubts when reading previous reviews.

First impressions of the hotel were great, very clean and modern. Staff at the hotel desk on arrival were very helpful and showed us to our room, which was on the seventh floor. The room was very clean, modern and spacious - had everything we needed for our stay in Dublin.

We had spent our full first day at Temple Bar Street, so we decided to head somewhere slightly more cosmopolitan on the evening. When asking at the reception for advice on nice cocktail bars and wine bars, the staff behind the desk were unable to help. I think it would be a good idea for the hotel to train their staff on the Dublin evening hotspots.

On our last morning we were woken up at around 8:30am, due to the noise coming from the room nextdoor. We could hear noises of banging and drills, which leads me to believe work was being carried out in the next room. This is no surprise as the hotel is newly renovated, however, it would've been nice for them to wait until around 10:00am or so.

Overall, our stay at The Address in Dublin was very nice and the location is ideal - we would definetely return!

Tip to those staying at The Address - as it is a 'new hotel' not many taxi drivers have heard of it, so when trying to direct your driver send him to the North Star Hotel.",4,2017,03,27
219,2 night saty in dublin,"good location just off talbot street. great staff and great breakfast. we had room 271 which wasnt the best due to trains departing the local station. the heating system needs updating, its air heating which is rather noisy. but overall a great stay.",4,2017,03,27
219,Lovely Atmosphere,"The reception area is modern, clean and had a lot of character. The staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived at 8 am and were allowed in our rooms early despite there 2 pm booking policy. Although our room was slightly older than the rest of the hotel, as it is currently under renovation - it wasn't shabby. We had a family room which was huge! 
Only a 5 minute walk from the main street, O'connell street and on the airport bus route. On the walk to O'connell street there are many bars and restaurants. Would recommend this hotel to all.",5,2017,03,27
219,Wonderful hotel!,"W o n d e r f u l !
A really nice and amazing hotel! The atmosphere, the lights and decorations, the room, the staff and the breakfast...just nice! Everything was perfect! I felt really welcome! Well done :-) We'll see us again! ",5,2017,03,24
219,Helpful Staff,"The reception area is comfortable and clean.  The check in was brilliant, we arrived mid morning and were able to check-in and have a room straight away which we very much appreciated.  The rooms are clean, modern and very comfortable with every convenience - plenty of tea & coffee etc, good hairdryer.  Our only complaint would be that we stayed at the back of the hotel (room 260) and we did find the traffic quite loud, there is obviously quite a lot of money being spent on this hotel and better double glazing, or an extra double glazed unit would make all the difference. We were also able to leave our luggage at the hotel on our last day which was most helpful.  Taxi's are available from the station across the road.",4,2017,03,22
219,A St Patrick's day weekend,"Gorgeous suite, very modern, very Hi-tech, although probably too much so for the average non-techy guest, but well worth the stay! 

The suite was ready when we checked in at 10am and the staff were nothing but polite, friendly, pleasant and helpful even when we returned after a St Patrick's day out in Dublin a bit worse for wear! 

A few style misses I think, there was no shampoo or body wash etc if you had a bath as it was safely tucked in non removable dispensers in the rain shower and dual sinks! 

There were complimentary crisps, biscuits and chocolate.. but the complimentary water has to be collected from the executive club lounge. Odd!  

However, these tiny comments of suggestion aside, definitely worth the reasonable price tag.

The only real criticism of the building being the breakfast room which was down a dingy staircase that had seen better days and the windowless breakfast area. It was the one area that let the rest of the trendy and upmarket surroundings down. The close proximity of the train station, whilst obviously bothered other guests, was not a problem, the muffled rumblings being quite soothing for a city.  

The general location, was, whilst not the most glamorous, convenient and a short walk away from all that Dublin has to offer. 

Well worth a visit and a gem in a very expensive city as it was very appropriately priced for what you get. Highly recommend a club suite!",4,2017,03,21
219,Liked it ,"We spent 8 nights at this hotel & would recommend it. It was new with a nice TV, bed & bathroom. Cool features like automated lights & curtains. Our water was brown the 1st time we turned the shower on, but we attributed that to the fact that there was construction. We had issues with our phone in the room, even after someone came up to fix it. We asked it to be fixed again & were told that they'd send someone, but never did. The hotel is right across the street from the Connolly Rail Station where you can hop on the Dart which can take you to some amazing places nearby. The housekeepers were extremely friendly & always provided us with anything we asked for. The staff at the front desk (during normal business hours) were helpful and friendly, and willing to help answer our typical tourist questions. Late night staff at the front desk was not so friendly, though. We liked the restaurant/bar attached to the hotel (amazing pizza!). We were also given a free breakfast voucher when we checked in...that continental breakfast was mediocre. You're less than a 10 minute walk to convenience stores which was nice...& there's a fridge in the room so you can store water bottles and such. There's a bar nearby called the Celt Bar that we absolutely loved. Live Irish music the nights we went. I didn't like the fact that there's no sign marked outside of the hotel, which made it a bit challenging to find. But it's the same location as the North Star, which should help point you in the direction should you get lost around town. Definitely enjoyed our stay (& loved Ireland!!). ",4,2017,03,21
219,Lovley,"Just got bck from staying at the north star for one night 
The hotel reception/bar area is really nice clean modern and gives you a good feel about the hotel. 
Check in was quick and easy we arrived round 9am and the room was ready, we got put on the 3rd floor.. now for me this is verry dated (the hotel are under renovation it will look amazing) i couldnt stay in this room it was dark no view and didnt have a good feel.. we asked to upgrade the man on reception was so nice he even showed us our upgrde options we looked at 3 rooms ‚Ç¨30 ‚Ç¨50 & ‚Ç¨70 upgrade... the more expensive is the brand new rooms but we went for the suite you also get entry to the premier club room for complimentary tea coffee water biscuits, was amazing really big windows floor to ceilling bright airy comfortable and spotless we even the ‚Ç¨30 room we would have been happy with that was also nice.
We had a birthday card and chocolate wich was a lovley little touch
The staff are really friendly and cant do enough for you would definatly stay again.
Great loction we paid for the airport bus that drops you up the road ‚Ç¨10 each return right next to the station but tbh you dont notice any noise. 
15/20min walk to temple bar taxi was around ‚Ç¨5/ ‚Ç¨10. ",5,2017,03,21
219,GREAT LOCATION - WITH AN IRISH FEEL....,"The hotel is about 5 Minute walk from the spire (bang in the city centre)..opposite the hotel - is train station - - but when you get out of the airport / its easier and cheaper to get the air bus 12 euro return,,,takes you right o O'Connell bridge. The hotel was very very clean - beautiful rooms,,great and easy book in, with a traditional irish smile..The restaurant was also very very good,,,The next time in Dublin...yes i will be staying here.",5,2017,03,21
219,sucks- everything about it sucks,"No car park. Nasty nasty space. Bur if you like cracking who responded ano junkies getting high outside  (thanks Garda for stepping into unasked ). Arg so bad we bithink the bullet,  paid 2 nights for 2 for naught and got a decent hotel. Shame, shame, shame on you north star. I will seekeep a refund on your hideous and disgusting offering.",1,2017,03,20
219,Perfect for Dublin weekend,"To be honest the hotel was better than I expected. We were there for a rugby weekend and so hotels were hard to find. However, the North Star was great - lovely spacious and well decorated room. Lively and friendly bar and a great Irish breakfast to help the hangover !

Only request would be to have water in the fridge.",5,2017,03,19
219,Stylish and modern ,I stayed here for one night during St Patrick's day weekend before moving onto another hotel. The hotel wasn't the easiest to find initially as there are no signs outside. You have to walk into the North Star Hotel to access it. Once inside first impressions were how new everything looked. The hotel only opened a couple of months ago and looks really nice. The room was kitted out to a high standard with modern switches for lights and even the curtains. All the staff we met were really helpful and friendly. The previous reviewer mentioned the noise from the railway. We were on the 5th floor and although we could hear them before we went out for dinner the trains had stopped by the time we got back and weren't running again until half 8 in the morning by which time we were awake anyway.,5,2017,03,19
219,Great stay,"We stayed for three nights & enjoyed every one of them, clean & comfortable room, staff very friendly & helpful. The breakfast is absolutely lovely, so much of it !!!  Our favourite place was the Bar, first class food & service, such lovely people. Highly recommend spending an evening there.
Within walking distance to everything, including trains & trams.",4,2017,03,16
219,Needs A Lot of Work,"We stayed for 2 nights in late February. Despite all the photos that I have seen, our room was nothing like pictured. The room was incredibly dated (orange shower tile, small sink,etc.). While it appeared that a portion of the hotel was being renovated, we certainly did not make it into one of the nice rooms on its website. Additionally, while parking is available, it is about a 5 minute walk away through an ""interesting"" section of the city. 

While the staff of the hotel were friendly, I found that the hotel was not as pictured or described. Hopefully, they are continuing with the renovations and will soon reach the room in which we stayed. ",3,2017,03,14
219,Great Hotel,This is a great hotel to stay in. This hotel is located to every single place you want to be in Dublin. It's walking distance to Temple Bar Area. The restaurant has variety of food and the price is very reasonable. John at the McGettigans bar was great.,5,2017,03,13
219,Lovely for the most part,The staff were very friendly and helpful when we arrived. The room was lovely and looked like it had been recently refurbished but it was extremely warm despite radiators being off. Fantastic breakfast as well with everything you could imagine.,4,2017,03,13
219,Weekend Away,"We've just spent a long weekend in Dublin, staying at the Northstar Hotel. The location is pretty good, 10-15 min walk to O'Connell Street and across the road from a train station. The surrounding streets are a little rundown but we didn't have any issues. The hotel is very nice, we stayed in a newly refurbished room which had all you need, including an ironing board (a must have for me!). Hotel staff are very welcoming and friendly without being overbearing. I'd definitely look at staying there if I'm ever in Dublin again. ",4,2017,03,12
219,Birthday weekend,"Fantastic hotel from the start immaculately clean great breakfast slightly pricey bar but that's Dublin comfortable beds spacious rooms , good hairdryer, ironing board toiletries .. can't wait to return ",5,2017,03,11
219,"Great location,gorgeous room, staff super helpful!!",Stayed here three weeks ago with my boyfriend. Our room was great. We had drinks and some amazing food in McGettigans bar there. Got to meet our chef Fergus who is a lovely guy and an absolute credit to the place. Rest of the staff were lovely also. Will be back soon!!!,5,2017,03,10
219,"Good value, good location but not all rosy","The hotel location is right next to Connolly train station in the city centre. The train/DART/LUAS connections are very handy and there is a Dublin Bike stand close by in Talbot Street. The location is a bit scruffy though so dont wander around at night in your Jimmy Choos talking loudly on your gold plated iPhone! I had no problems but just be sensible. The hotel itself was very good value (for Dublin) and check in was efficient, friendly and professional. My room was quite good but my bathroom was a bit tired and at odds with the bedroom quality. I gave them a list of repairs on checking out (helpful fellow that I am). Maybe I was unlucky with my room. The breakfast was excellent and the breakfast room was very good too. There is a gym in the basement and the bar and restaurant are fine. I have eaten there a few times during the day and while it wont win any awards for the cuisine, the food is absolutely fine and good value. All in all I was impressed with the decor of the public areas but was let down by the bathroom. The price is good and the location has its pros and cons. It depends on what your priorities are.",4,2017,03,09
219,Perfect Location,"We were originally suppose to stay at the Regency Hotel, which was outside of City Center, but they overbooked, so we were transferred to North Star.  We were so happy we did.  It is a great location in the City Center and everything is walking distance.  The hotel was very nice, updated, clean and comfortable.  The restaurant connected to it, McGettigans, is very good and reasonable.  The only downfall is the parking, which is a couple blocks away behind Connolly Station.  ",4,2017,03,08
219,Good location ,"When I say good location, I'm referring, obviously, in relation to my office, which was a 15 minute walk. But still not too far from the Temple Bar area, if you're into nice walks while trying to get to know the city. 
I found the hotel cosy and clean with friendly staff at the reception. 
The room had different types of complementary coffees and tea bags. 
Didn't stay much in the hotel but it got me the sense of security and privacy I needed. 
Initially I wasn't aware that you cannot acquire beverage with alcohol after 10 pm in Dublin (possible the entire Ireland) but the staff at the reception was kind enough to let me know ahead of time if I needed to buy Guinness. Really thankful for that tip!
If I come back to Dublin, I will definitely stay in the hotel. ",4,2017,03,07
219,Weekend away,"Just returned from a 2 night stay here Friday and Saturday night . Although the reception and bar and really new and welcoming this doesn't follow through for the rest of the hotel when we arrived at reception to book in we were sent to the wrong floor for our room and had to go back to reception were we were then sent to the right room very basic for what we paid and it said on our paper work continental breakfast included but no.after a very wet Friday went back to our room which felt really cold tried to alter heating although it said 23 degrees it defiantly wasn't so when we went to the bar at night we called at reception and somone wen to sort it. We went in the bar for a few drinks food really good staff really friendly went back to room lovely and warm woke early next morning with fire alarm. Went out for breakfast and a nice day out about 15 mins to temple bar area if your a fast walker, after a full day out  and evening meal out few drinks went back really tired . If your think you will get a peaceful night think again door slamming shouting all night fire alarm went off twice woke next morning just as tired won't stay here again .",3,2017,03,06
219,Wonderful experience,Stayed in the North Star hotel on the 4th March 2017 from the moment we walked in we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff. The hotel was extremely relaxing and clean. The food in the restaurant was very tasty and reasonable priced the waiters and staff were very friendly and made our stay enjoyable. The improvements they have made to the hotel over the years has made it one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in in a long time and well worth a visit the next time your staying in Dublin,4,2017,03,05
219,Visiting Dublin ,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights. Beautiful decor, very modern. But it's right next to the train line, very noisy. Also fire alam kept going off so didn't get a full nights sleep Friday or Saturday. Staff don't know what they're doing and didn't seem to care. Such a shame as could be a lovely place, if they sound proofed the rooms and gave their staff some professional training. ",1,2017,03,05
219,Nice rooms and good location.,"Two friends and I stayed in a triple room for three nights. The room was spacious, clean and beds were comfy. Shower was good and shampoo/conditioner/body was was provided. Tea making facilities were provided and topped up every day. We found only 2 towels and 2 cups on arrival, but staff were quick to bring extra to our room when we rang reception. However, we ran out of toilet roll on the last day and, despite ringing reception, staff didn't bring extra to our room (luckily the domestic trolley was on the corridor). The walls are pretty thin but this wasn't an issue for us as we were out drinking for most of the weekend.
The hotel is in a brilliant location. There's a bus and tram stop directly across the road and it was only a ‚Ç¨6 taxi into town. It's also only a 10 minute walk to O'Connell street. 
Overall, good value for money (we paid approx. ¬£130 each for 3 nights).",4,2017,03,05
219,Fantastic!!,Beautiful room-we stayed in the brand new apartment complex. Brekkie was yummy and there was loads of choice! Location is only 10mins walk from the Temple Bar area. Great transport links. The staff here are warm and friendly and couldn't do enough for us! I left my very expensive bag of jewellery behind I was so upset but I contacted the hotel and they sent it back to me the same day-Sharon from housekeeping was just amazing. Can't fault it! ,5,2017,03,04
219,Just another average hotel. ,"My wife and I stayed here one night and we were relieved it was only one. The hotel is an older building with no lift/elevator to rooms on the upper floors. We had to lug three suitcases up to the second floor. Our room had the train directly next to it so we heard that all night long and shining in the windows were bright purple lights from the building next door. It was clean and the bed was comfy, the bathroom was nice. The location is great and the service was helpful. The lobby looks far better than the rest of the hotel. ",3,2017,03,02
219,Nice lobby. Below Average Classic Rooms.,"Stayed in a classic room with 2 horribly uncomfortable twin beds. The mattresses were so flat we could feel every spring and coil in the frame. There was no alarm clock in the room which I found very odd. On Tuesdays, a loud fire alarm goes off periodically. The front desk said this was standard of all hotels; however, we've stayed in the Citywest Hotel in Dublin and did not encounter any fire alarms on Tuesdays. 

There is no on-site parking or parking garage.The front desk recommended we park in the LUAS parking lot; however, we found street parking that was much closer and cheaper. 

",2,2017,03,01
219,Charming Dublin and the North Star hotel.,"We have just had a 2 night stay in the lovely city of Dublin, at the North Star hotel. We weren't bothered about a view, only needed a bed, shower and a kettle. Rooms were excellent and the cleaning staff were very good. Clean towels and bedding for the duration of our stay. We received a very warm welcome at booking in, and helpful staff when it came to leave.
The hotel itself is situated opposite the Connolly rail station, and easy to access. We went to Bray for a trip to the beach for a couple of hours for ‚Ç¨10.
 A steady 15 minutes walk from the hotel is Temple Bar and all its various watering holes and culinary eating establishments.
There is a hop on hop off bus system to see all the delights of Dublin, where you can get off at a site and visit, then get back on and continue round for ‚Ç¨19 each.
For the 2 nights we were there we had an awesome time. As we never ate in the hotel restaurant I can't say what it was like, but it was reasonably peopled when we passed by.
We would certainly return to this hotel if we were to go back to Dublin.",5,2017,02,28
219,Actually exceeded my expectations so very happy with my visit and everything is in walking distance!,"Me and my girlfriend visited Dublin for 4 nights and very happy with the hotel, tidy rooms, comfy bed and a nice bathroom. Everything was in walking distance, only the guinness factory was about a 20 minute walk if you know where you are going. 

The only bad thing i have to say about the hotel was it was very hot and struggled to sleep the first night. We didn't try any of the food so i cant comment about that.",4,2017,02,28
219,Great Hotel,We stayed in the Club Suite with Rooftop Lounge Access and it was amazing. The room was new and clean and i couldn't fault it. The staff were friendly and they checked us in early without any hassle. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.,5,2017,02,28
219,Ok,Very noisey hotel had quests beside us banging doors all night and builders early next morning also horrible smell in the room other than that was ok nice friendly staff food next door was nice and very close to the shops and bus service to airport which was very helpful for us but wouldnt not stay again due to really bad sleep ,2,2017,02,26
219,Modern hotel but still some problems to iron out ,"We stayed in this hotel for a girlie weekend away. 
We were in ""The Address"" which was meant to be the modern, converted part of the hotel. 
The room had been newly refurbished with brand new furniture however we had a few issues. 
There was no hot water in the mornings which mean we had freezing cold showers. When we phoned down to reception we were told it was because there was too much pressure on the boiler because it was early morning. They told us to wait 15 minutes but an hour later it was still very cold. 
The coffee machine in our bedroom was broken which meant we had to keep phoning down for teas and coffees. 
The beds were also very soft which want to our taste.
Apart from that the hotel is very well located and the staff are very friendly. ",3,2017,02,26
219,Stayed again for valentines :),"Yet again this hotel never fails me or my partner. 

Were welcomed warmly and acknowledged at repeat guests which was a lovely touch. We had a lovely room on the 6th floor with a balcony and a newly upgraded coffee machine, this hotel was lovely a year ago and ive now stayed 4 times in the past year and its even better thanks to its beautiful refurbishment. Beds are always comfy and maids always clean your room as soon as you ask. Fantastic stay yet again and i will be back again before the years out amazing hotel fantastic staff and you just cant beat the breakfast!! 

Thanks again guys!!

Keep up the good work, 

kind regards

Sheree x",5,2017,02,25
219,Bad Sleep,"Stayed here for a night during the week. I will start with the negatives of my experience; the curtains didn't close properly so I found it hard to sleep during the night and then from around 2am until half 4-5am there was a constant alarm going and then add the constant racket from the trains the whole night made it impossible to get a decent night's sleep. The positives include that the hotel staff are very friendly, the hotel is very clean and bright, the breakfast was very beautiful. Overall I had a mixed experience.",3,2017,02,24
219,Sleep deprivation,"First impressions of foyer was stunning and new ,  very helpful staff on the reception desk we were a party of 8 celebrating my 50 th birthday  we arrived at 9am to drop our cases off until it was time to check in only to be told our rooms were ready ! This was fantastic we were on the ground floor room 155 friends were in rooms 153 151 and165 we entered rooms all looked ok was nice and clean until closer inspection room was tired especially bathroom shower was sat in hole on wall not fixed properly lock on door fell off decor was poor our view out of our window was looking over a building site were they were building the new extension to the hotel but we were only there 2 nights we could cope with that until it came to sleep time our rooms were near a new security door they have fitted which is a heavy fire door which nearly every guest has to enter through but the builders have not made it a soft quiet close and instead banged closed  extremely loudly everytime it was opened it was horrendously noise didn't hardly get any sleep the 2 nights we were there also none  of the rooms had soft closes on either so we heard them opening and closing all the time  they allow big hen and stag party's to stay in this hotel and we had a few who were noisey on there return from there celebrations we had no problem with them  it was that door it drove us crazy ! It was such a shame I have read many reviews on here from people who have stayed in the new extension rooms saying how fantastic there rooms were we obviously was in the old original side our rooms were awful we have travelled the world and we all have to say this is the noisiest and having the worst view  from room we have ever experienced we approached reception about the door they couldn't apologise enough  they said they would get it sorted for future guests but after returning home and read reviews it seems as though other people have had same issues so obviously nothing has been done about it ! I left a letter for the manager enclosing my cocerns and had a prompt email back of apologies but it did spoil our break and for that I can't rate this as a 4 star maybe a 2 star",2,2017,02,22
219,really good time was had,"Just a few words to say thank you to the staff at the north star for an enjoyable stay room was beautiful ,food was excellent and suitable to everyone s needs ,staff were pleasant,cheerful and helpful and fun .",5,2017,02,22
219,Beautiful hotel in amazing location,"Myself and a friend stayed here on the 19th of February, and I have to say we were more than impressed. From the time we walked through to the beautifully decorated lobby we could tell we were in for a luxurious stay. Daniel and Julie at the front desk couldn't have done more for us and their warmth and friendliness really made our stay. We ate in the spotless cookhouse,  the service was quick and efficient and the food was lovely. Our room was on  sixth floor and like every other part of the hotel,  the rooms were spotlessly clean and the beds were just so comfortable! The 7th floor executive lounge is such a lovely touch as well and it was great looking out over the city! The location of the hotel was one of the best parts, if nothing else the short walk into the city centre was so convenient. It was most certainly one of the better stays I've had in Dublin and from now on I definitely wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting the city! ",5,2017,02,20
219,So thoughtful!,We checked in here as the first stop on our honeymoon and they could not have been more thoughtful and welcoming. They were really lovely. We are going back later this week and are already very excited.,5,2017,02,19
219,Amazing Hotel,"Visited for our anniversary and were upgraded to a premier King room upon arrival. The hotel decor is just gorgeous, the staff were so friendly and helpful, cannot fault it at all. Definitely visit McGettigans on the ground floor of the hotel, we had the most amazing food here and such a great atmosphere. The location of the hotel was perfect for us a 5 min walk to the centre. Absolutely loved Dublin and we will absolutely be staying at the North Star upon our return! 
Thanks for a fabulous stay! ",5,2017,02,17
219,New extension,"We were given one of the new rooms which is very nice, everything was electronic, touch pad on walls for heating, lighting, closing curtains, Do not disturb, Bedding needs changing etc...
Good idea is the tv is the wifi router so you gain acces to wifi through TV, each room has own login so faster wifi signal, had a couple of teething issues but the service to get these fixed was extremely fast.",5,2017,02,16
219,Get ya sen to North Star,"Where to begin. Me and my fella wanted a nice,steady and romantic weekend. Our flights were early in the morning which meant we arrived at the hotel at 7:30am. The staff were amazing as they already had our room ready, allowed us to have a few hour kip. What more could I ask for? Apart from the fact every single member of staff would stop their day to day jobs to chat to us and ask if there was anything they could help us with. Not only that they even went out their way at 11:00pm to have us a pizza made and delivered to our room  even though the restaurant closed at 10pm as we went to show that lasted longer than expected. The food was mega and I couldn't get enough safe to say my diet went out the window. Typical weather meant raincoats and scalfs, they had umbrellas to hand out to all guests. Good job they were prepared coz I wasn't. Such a clean, organised place that didn't make me feel like a common normal class lass as some high rated hotels like to. Generally if you want an easy, pleasant time in Dublin especially if you've never been before stay at this fab hotel. Absolute loved it and felt right at home. Perfect.",5,2017,02,13
219,"Good restaurant, no parking","Our stay here was comfortable, there is OFF-SITE parking, a couple of blocks away.  The hotel was very nice to us, with some free upgrades.  We didn't experience noisiness.  They are renovating sections, but overall our experience was good.  Breakfast was good.  Our experience with the restaurant was fantastic, good seafood.",4,2017,02,13
219,All you'd want from a hotel - until it's time to sleep,"Stayed here Thursday 9th and Friday 10th Feb, checking out on 11th. The hotel is in a great location, located only half an hour away on the 747 bus from the airport - no trouble at all. We arrived early and were blown away by how beautiful the reception was. Dropped our bags with a very helpful member of reception staff while we went to explore Dublin as it was not time to check in yet. Our room was on the ground floor and although the decor was not on the same level of that in reception, the room was nice enough and had all we needed. Had a slight issue with water pressure in the shower on the first day but this seemed to sort itself out. Staff on reception were great throughout and always had a smile on their face and a pleasant greeting for you when you walked past. Our issues started however at 7:30 on Friday morning when we were awoken by drilling outside our window. Looked outside and there were several builders working on a wall right outside our room! The drilling, later joined by banging, continued until 9am when we left the room (we'd originally planned to lie in but couldn't because of the noise). Spoke to reception who apologised and advised we would not have the same issue the next morning as the builders do not work weekends. So again on Friday night, we went to bed with the plan to wake up at aroung 10/10:30. Unfortunately however this also did not happen as we were woken at around 8:15 by who I can only assume was the cleaning manager/supervisor shouting at one of her staff in the room opposite.

A real shame because the hotel is in a great location, clean, great reception staff, comfy bed but ultimately we didn't sleep well at all and that was all we really required.",2,2017,02,13
219,Very impressed,"Stayed here on sat 11th Feb, 3 couples . We had premier rooms which were really lovely.recently refurbished bathrooms , lovely coffee machine and robes and slippers in room. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant which was first class, and got complimentary prosecco. The hotel is very handy for bus and train station. Would stay here again and would highly recommend. Slight issue with the elevator which seemed to have a mind of its own ! Overall a great hotel which I would previously not have considered!

219,"Very misleading, paperthin walls","This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in and I travel a lot. The reception made it look like it's a really modern place, but when you get to the rooms it's a different story. The one I was in was outdated and very old fashioned, I was highly disappointed. But the worst thing about the stay was the noise. The walls are paperthin. When the people next door returned from their night out and decided to play music, it was like hell on earth. Credit to the staff who came down to deal with it, but then the next door lot decided to do something else with their time, and you could hear EVERYTHING! I asked to be moved but was told there were no rooms available. Also there are no anti- slam doors so when someone goes in and out of their room you can hear it all night. I've had hardly no sleep and I just feel so disappointed by a hotel, which looked so promising when you first book it. Definitely not a 4 star hotel, was surprised when I saw thats how it's described.",1,2017,02,11
219,Cheap but noisey,"The hotel reception is fantastic. Modern and expensive looking. However the rooms are not to the same standard. They are clean but not decorated. If you are a light sleeper like me, ask for an inward facing bedroom because the noise from the traffic through the single glazed windows is bad. They should invest in better sound proofing. The locks on the doors do not allow for the bedroom doors to be closed quietly and so you are woken many times by slamming doors or noisey parties of lads just here for the beer. The saunas are male and female separated by changing rooms so if you do not have a same sex friend you are sauna'ing alone. The hotel is not too far a walk to the main shopping areas and temple bar area. Overall it is a nice hotel but it has more cons over pros. If I had paid more for my stay I would be disappointed. ",3,2017,02,11
219,Good value comfortable Hotel,The North Star on Amiens St is a comfortable and pleasant Hotel offering good quality Rooms and being within 10 minutes walk of O'Connell St. Good value for money in a City which is generally not cheap!,4,2017,02,08
219,Loved It!,The hotel is nicely appointed.  We loved the lobby!  The hotel was very clean even though they are doing some renovation.  Our room was cozy and comfortable.  The front desk staff were wonderful about answering our first time visitor questions. We will return to Dublin and will most definitely stay at the North Star!,5,2017,02,06
219,Great location,"We got the airlink bus from Dublin airport to the hotel. The hotel is situated within 15 mins walk of O'Connell street. We stayed on 7th floor, room was very comfortable and ideal for our time in Dublin. The lift was an issue when we were in a rush, so leave time for this. We would recommend this hotel and will return. Thanks",5,2017,02,06
219,"Pleasant, but could do with an update.","The hotel seemed to be undergoing some renovation when we were staying, but this did not cause a real problem when we stayed. The lobby of the hotel is lovely but doesn't really mach the quality of the room we had- this may be due to the aforementioned renovation work.

We had a ground floor room with a window right onto the street, so we had to have the curtains closed for most of the time we were in there.You do get a fair amount of noise from the street, we are used to street noise but if you're not I can imagine that it will cause problems. What did get a bit annoying was the banging of the door in the hall every time somebody went through it.

Overall the room was clean if a bit old fashioned (probably one that hadn't been renovated yet.) Breakfast was a Irish breakfast which was tasty, with the options of fruit and a pancake machine that we did not use.

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from O'Connell street and right over the road from Connolly train station. The area looks a bit rough and I can see why some of the other reviewers may have been a bit nervous walking around it at night, but we had no problems. If your not used to cities and get intimidated by them you might want to pay a bit more and stay up on O'Connell street. 

All the staff where very friendly and helpful and the hotel over all was good. We would probably give it another go next time we are in Dublin hopefully the renovations will be finished.
",4,2017,02,05
219,Very good ,"The hotel from the outside looks lovely. Reception is very clean, modern and up to date. Plenty of seating.  Staff were very friendly and helpful whilst checking in. It was very quick and easy.  The lady then gave us directions to our room. 

Our room was very spacious and clean.  We only booked for two people but got a double bed and a single in there. Good lighting and a place to sit and do your hair/make up in front of a mirror. Tv with lots of channels. Room was cleaned daily and fresh towels given. 

Bathroom was spacious and clean. Plenty of towels.  Very hot shower. 

Nothing at all to moan about for the price we paid. 
(Only thing I would say is there wasn't many plug sockets for phone chargers/straighteners etc,  but that's Not a major problem.)

The hotel was in a Good location.  Very close to shops and temple bar area. Took about 15 mins to walk to temple bar. And 10 mins to shops. There is a little high street near hotel with shops to buy anything you need. (Tesco, spar, Poundland, and lots of food places) 

The hotel is right by bus stops ... We got a bus from the airport to hotel
For only ‚Ç¨6 per person. 
Ask the 'info' point at airport and they direct you to bus stop and give you a Bus leaflet with timetable and route. 

I have read on here loads of reports about the trains being loud and people having problems sleeping.....   we didn't have this problem at all
We didn't find it noisy and we slept well. (We were on second floor.) ",5,2017,02,04
219,Hoppy,"No place to unload your luggage, no place to park your car, on an extremely busy Boulevard directly across from the train station, the metro rail goes through the hotel on the second floor so you constantly hear the train going through on the rails above your room, rooms on the first floor have constant traffic both foot and automotive making noise well into the night making it difficult to sweep the experience was not good",1,2017,02,01
219,Great hotel for a weekend away,Excellent stay here at the North Star. Great comfortable  and clean rooms and stylish public areas. Excellent service from all staff and a bar and restaurant with good food. Location easy to access Dublin attractions. ,5,2017,01,31
219,Great place to stay,"Very clean, friendly helpful staff, near to the main areas of Dublin centre. Never got the chance to sample the breakfast. Staff alwa√Ωs on hand to help. Good sized clean room. It was recommended by family and we would certainly recommend it to anyone travelling to Dublin",4,2017,01,30
219,Excellent service and very comfortable,"All the amenities you need, including an iron and ironing board in the room. Very efficient and courteous staff. A little bit on the pricey side but this isn't really an issue for me. Very nice evening meal from room service.",5,2017,01,29
219,Great stay,"My friend and I stayed at the North Star Hotel for 3 night. The receptionists were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and cared for. Unfortunately there was a lot of noise (slamming doors, shouting, ...) the first night. The front desk staff apologised for the inconvenience and felt sorry for us. We were offered a new upgraded room and a daytour around the city. We really apreciated this! The location of the hotel in the city is great to walk to most attractions. The restaraunt has lovely food at a reasonable price. We would certainly visit hotel again.",4,2017,01,26
219,Not bad but it could be better.,"We spent three days staying at the north star hotel. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the room was nice and clean. The only downside was the noise of a door slamming all night, my husband had serious difficulties falling asleep, I just get some sleep because I was wearing hear pluggs.
The room can be a little cold, but i think you can ask for another blanket.
Breakfeast is a little bit expensive for what you eat.",3,2017,01,25
219,Lovely hotel,"Visited the hotel with the girls for a weekend in Dublin. The receptionists were lovely and very helpful. At the point of check in they offered us an upgrade to include a continental breakfast at a discounted rate. As we did not book breakfast we took them up on this offer. 

The rooms were lovely and very clean and decorated nicely. 

On the Saturday we went for breakfast at 9 (served from 8am-10am) but there was nothing in there at this time. We then went to reception who soon sorted the situation and allowed us to eat in the main dining room. 

The hotel is in a great location, only about a 20 minute walk to Temple Bar and less to the shops. There is a lovely pub round the corner also who serve lovely food. 

I would visit this hotel again.",4,2017,01,24
219,Was not disappointed ,"Stayed here for two nights for a birthday suprise weekend away and was not disappointed the hotel is smart, clean and the staff couldn't be more helpful. It is a pleasant 15 mins walk to the hussle and bustle of Dublin centre. Its in close proximity to all the bus routes / bars 

Got the deal for the room through booking.com and looking online since I booked the room... I got and absolute bargain.

It's right near to the train station so don't be suprised if u here them pass... all part and parcel of being near a city centre!",5,2017,01,23
219,Beautiful stay in newly renovated North Star,"I had the pleasure to spend a night in the gorgeous North Star hotel this weekend. It has been beautifully renovated to a fab boutique hotel style with a stunning reception area that rivals any top class hotel in class. We were lucky to stay on the exquisite 7th floor with access to its own private lounge , first class experience . The room itself was stunning with stylish decor. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel as it's location is excellent and the staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly. Will definitely return ! ",5,2017,01,22
219,Simply the Best! ,"Fantastic hotel in every way! Needed somewhere local to the 3arena as was heading down on the train from Belfast to see Simply Red with my Mum. This hotel is around a 25 min walk from there and close to the tram stop, as well as being literally across the road from Connelly Station. We were able to go shopping on the Saturday and then conveniently call into the hotel to retrieve our bags and have a glass of wine before heading across the road to catch the train home. Fantastic location, value for money, service and gorgeous decor. Highly recommend! ",5,2017,01,22
219,Very enjoyable stay,This is the second time I've stayed here and once again it didn't disappoint! Our room was ready for us not long after we arrived even though it was before the allotted check-in time. The room was lovely and tidy. Everything is within a half hour walk and there are plenty of shops nearby. Definitely recommend the North Star and will be coming back.,4,2017,01,18
219,Excellent Stay,"The front desk staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. The rooms are clean, well prepared and cared for.  the location in the city was great to walk to most attractions, food, and shopping.  Restaraunt on site has great food at a reasonable price.",5,2017,01,18
219,Delightful Stay,"Located in the heart of Dublin and close to Train and Bus Station , it met all my needs it was clean well run and staff were  friendly and helpful . Had  plenty of facilities such as a sauna if you like to relax.",5,2017,01,17
219,Not what I expected,"The staff at the North Star were pleasant and helpful, but the rest of the hotel was less than welcoming.  Our room was on the ground floor.  There was a road or alleyway outside that was used greatly 24 hours a day.  There was a row of garbage cans directly outside our window (which had bars on it).  We had to keep the curtains drawn to avoid the people looking in.  It must have been garbage collection night as there was loud noise and men shouting back and forth during the wee hours.  The toilet didn't flush properly.  The room was small and dark and the bed was hard.  We didn't sleep at all - mostly due to the constant noise outside, partly due to the noise from the hallway/other guests in the hotel who had no concern for others.  Being locked in didn't give us a sense of being in a safe neighborhood.  Having to walk to our car in the rail station lot across the street was frightening at 4 am.  Early flight home required our leaving at that time.  The other people we were traveling with had a room upstairs and didn't experience the bars on their window or the constant loud noise.  I see this hotel has excellent reviews from many people, I wish I could leave one as well but I can't.",1,2017,01,15
219,Wonderful stay,"Located right in the heart of the city,this hotel met all our needs. It was clean, well run, and the staff was exceptionally friendly. The Concierge was extremely helpful in making suggestions and pointing us in the right direction. Breakfast was delicious and certainly filling. Highly recommended.",5,2017,01,15
219,Excellent Hotel,We have just stayed for 2 night in this hotel and we have had a fantastic stay.  The staff are friendly and helpful and all are very polite.  Our room was comfortable and clean with a very nice coffee machine which made a nice change from the usual small kettle.  We had the  continental breakfast daily and there were adequate choices for both of us.  It is in a good location for the main attractions and is about 10 mins walk from the Dublin sightseeing bus stops.  We used the air link bus from the airport which drops you off approx 5 mins from the hotel.  Excellent service and good location we will definitely be coming back again.,5,2017,01,09
219,Don't stay here if you want to relax ,"Cleaners will have you up at half 7 banging doors pulling hoovers around constanlt making noise .we've stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin but never heard the like of the noise in this hotel .Toilet was loose ,water wasn't very hot shower was a drippel wouldn't class this as a relaxing weekend won't be staying again staff were very pleasant the only nice thing ",3,2017,01,08
219,Brilliant hotel,Just stayed here for the weekend with my partner. Staff are brilliant and very polite. Rooms are comfortable. Main attractions including temple bar are within a couple of minutes walking distance. Only downside is the shower; although it was warm and powerful it came out like a hose pipe. Apart from that I would recommend this hotel and would stay again in the future. ,5,2017,01,08
219,Lunch in the DMZ,"Not bad, not bad at all for lunch. My recollection of the North Star would have been less than positive, a run-down railway hotel in a decidedly seedy part of town. The neighbourhood is still pretty grim but the North Star, recently refurbished apparently, is an oasis of civilisation in comparison. My companion, who works in the area, eats here regularly, was on 1st name terms with the floor staff and used the timeless 'my usual' when ordering lunch. This turned out to be a prawn and crayfish salad which was huge and, judging by her cleared plate afterwards, acceptable. I ordered a burger which was pretty good too although I got got skinny chips whereas she got fabulous chunky ones. The benefit of being a regular I guess. A very pleasant and surprisingly comfortable way of passing a Friday lunchtime. Worth a look.",4,2017,01,07
219,Excellent Holiday Break in Dublin,Stayed in this hotel between Xmas and New Year. Staff were great and rooms very comfortable. Eat in the restaurant which was also good. We found hotel ideal for lots of the attractions Dublin has to offer. We also unfortunately left an item in one of the rooms which the staff looked after and sent on without any fuss,4,2017,01,07
219,Very Friendly and helpful smiling staff,"Stayed 2 nights in family suite room December 20-23. Family landed early in Dublin airport after long haul flight, requested early check in and late check out online, room was ready at 9am and late checkout wasn't an issue. Staff were excellant and all smiled during interactions and always offered a "" good morning/afternoon/evening and good night"". Rooms could do with an updating but the lobby area and working around the hotel (which didn't inconvenience us) suggests an update programme currently underway. We didn't have any food in hotel as its so central. Central for luas tram, intercity train, dart  rail , taxi rank across the road and buses. Hotel is located near a rain line and no of us heard a train at any stage during morning or late evening. Really enjoyed the stay and would return.",4,2017,01,03
219,Rooms need major refurbishment,"Booked a Standard Room and ended up on the ground floor beside a quite street. Not so, although there wasn't much traffic, you heard every vehicle go by including pedestrians talking outside. Needed a siesta after an early start but got woke up 3 times with the noise.
Got moved to the 3 floor level in a room for 3 which was much better and quieter. The rooms however are very dated, in particular the bathroom which has a hit or miss shower, ie, you may get water or maybe not, this was undoubtedly the worst shower I have ever experienced in a 4 star Hotel.
The breakfast was however excellent, with good choices and quality, including the coffee. The bar and restaurant was also very good and very popular not least with non residents.
The staff overall were very accommodating. Enjoyed our stay overall.",4,2017,01,03
219,Warm welcome from friendly staff,"We were catching a train to Belfast on New Years Eve. Had not booked anywhere for a meal as at 5pm we thought there would be plenty of availability. However many Dublin restaurants  were closed and we had given up hope of getting a meal until we remembered calling in at a hotel opposite the station for a drink  What a lucky break ! Although fully booked , they squeezed us in. We just had mains  but they were tasty and the service was faultless.",4,2017,01,02
219,Good Choice,"We stayed there for 4 nights in a 3-bed-room. No complaints at all. Very friendly and helpful staff. The Concierge really took care of us when he found out that our airline was on strike! Thanks again, Sir! Location is great. Temple bar and other attractions are within walking distance. Excellent breakfast, too.",4,2016,12,30
219,Defiantly recommend ,"Lovely hotel! Great location Just minutes walk away from shops
Room was spacious, clean and Modern. 
Only compliant would be that the pillows are too hard
Restaurant and  was lovely set out with gorgeous food and lovely cocktails. 

",4,2016,12,30
219,Great Hotel,"From the rooms to the restaurant, everything was just perfect! We enjoyed our stay here very much! The amenities were great. Stayed here with a group of 20 and everyone felt the same way! Definitely will stay here again!",5,2016,12,29
219,Surprise stay,"I wasn't sure at first, the outside was not impressive but inside was nice.  It is centrally located next to the train station but parking is 400 meters away.  There is a loading area in front for getting luggage around but beware of commuter times.  Rooms were clean and comfortable, staff amazingly hospitable and professional.  Near great for and pubs.",4,2016,12,22
219,What a difference in twenty years!,"My wife and I stayed here for one night recently when attending a gig in Dublin. I booked it as it was the best priced Hotel I could find for the given night. Having stayed there almost 20 years ago and not having the best memories of the place, I was a little nervous about this time around. The was no need to be as the Hotel has been transformed into a modern, beautiful, trendy and chic establishment that the only fault I can think of is we ONLY booked the one night! On checking in, at a stunning check in/reception area, the staff we extremely pleasant and helpful. We were upgraded to the 7th floor and on arrival to our room, we were greeted by a spotlessly clean, modern, spacious and luxurious room with an equally stylish and shining en suite! 
The facilities at the Hotel were excellent, with a very trendy bar and a gym downstairs (it wasn't that kind of stay for us!). Breakfast n the morning was self service and had a great selection with the produce fresh and the hot food HOT and of a very good quality. Even though this Hotel is only a short walk to O'Connell st, we hadn't considered it in recent years as we tended to look in different areas. However, that will not be the case in future and I would strongly recommend staying here. Loved everything about it and we will be back! 
P.s, the bed was one of the most comfortable sleeps we ever had, amazing mattress!",5,2016,12,21
219,Quaint,"From the outside, you are thinking...hmmm. But once inside you are pleasantly suprised!  It is a lovely place, quaint and cozy with plenty of little areas in the lobby for a cuppa and possibly a pastry.  Or just to talk.  The rooms are small, but clean.  We expected a double but our room had a double and two singles!  The bathroom had recently been redone and very nice.  BIG fluffy towels!  The staff was very friendly, even letting us check in early because we were so wiped from our flight.  It's close to everything downtown and right across from the bus station.  Taxis everywhere to take you where you want to go.  One caveat: no parking except across the way at the Connely transpo station.  I would def stay here again!",5,2016,12,14
219,Great staff!,"I usually ignore big city hotels, preferring something a bit smaller and more personal. However, I can't fault the North Star and the staff really made it a lovely experience, from the cheerful morning crew to the helpful people working on reception. A special mention to one (Julia, Brazilan I think) who seemed go out of her way to be warm and helpful, whether recommending a place to eat or sorting out our luggage when we had to leave it for a late flight. It's this personal touch that made the hotel seem more like a small family run place than a big faceless place.

Mike P",5,2016,12,13
219,great,"I visited this hotel with a group of friends and family to celebrate my daughters 30th birthday. I have to say that our stay was first class from the moment we entered the building. Friendly staff, lovely food and great bar service. Found the overall look and decor very high standard and loved our room, which was fully equipped with essentials, like hairdryer and iron etc. Definitely made our stay special, even down to the excellent breakfast.",5,2016,12,09
219,City centre comfort,"The North Star is a terrific city centre four star property in Dublin.  Located just across the street from the main railway line to Belfast and handy for both the Luas tram and the main shopping thoroughfares, this property is a huge credit to the McGettigans, who own it. Well-designed reception with efficient staff; good bar for coffee, drinks or rendezvous and well furnished bedrooms.  The new wing promises to be even better and I am very happy to recommend this property and its staff.",5,2016,12,06
219,Disappointed !!!,"When we finally find the hotel (the plaque at the front doesn't say North Star Hotel), check in was smooth & quick & we where all very grateful as we just wanted a shower & to go to bed. Open the door to our room & as we start to walk in we see that there are already people in the room !!! We left our teenagers with our suitcases in the hallway & went back to reception. Finally found us another room, but we spent the whole time worried someone was going to have a key & get into our room.  The room was small & unappealing, the shower pressure was non existent. The casing on the bath was broken & there was mood in the grout between the tiles & just to add to the class of the bathroom, a screw was the dial in the shower. The beds where comfortable, but you could hear your neighbours. Lots of people seemed to be having issues as nearly every time we went through reception people where saying ""this is the second time Iv had to come down"" or ""this isn't working"" the restaurant attached to the hotel is great & you are straight across the road from the Connolly train station, but that means you can hear them & sometimes even feel them. Most things you would want yo see in Dublin are on the south side & if I ever return, I will stay on the south.",2,2016,12,06
219,Lovley,"Stunning hotel. Opposite the train station. It's soft lighting as you come In  staff with a smile on there face. The room was lovely warm clean and modern. As we arrived on a Sunday early and did not know where to go, theconcerurge suggested the hop on hop off bus. Which was cheaper getting it from him them the company. Lovely restrants next door lovely people I  there. Also they have a bag room which is locked and staff only.",5,2016,12,05
219,A Fantastic All Rounder,"Having stayed in The North Star before they had renovated the reception area I was amazed at the work they'd done. It now matches the rest of the hotel in that it's become a modern and welcoming area where you can just sit back and relax in luxury, while still being in the middle of the city. 

On check-in I was greeted by Daniel, who was extremely friendly, efficient and made whats usually the most dreaded part of a break away painless. I even got a helpful little map of the city from him as part of the check in process. It mightn't seem a lot but the little touches like that are the things that make the North Star different from a lot of the other city centre hotels I've stayed in. 

I was given a family room, and obviously it had been refurbished in the not too distant past, with flat screen TV, plenty of space and an absolutely immaculate Bathroom, and while normally not a great sleeper, I found the bed to be one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.

I met with a friend the evening I checked in and we dined in the Mcgettigan's Cookhouse downstairs. Once again, a modern and vibrant space matched only by the quality of the staff, and through having a drink at the bar before dinner I knew each of them by name. 

As it was on my first visit the food was faultless, it came out fast, was piping hot and the presentation was impeccable. I'd recommend it to anyone. We stayed around in the bar for a few drinks before heading onto O'Connell Street, not even a five minute walk away. 

The following day and none the better from the night before I went once again down to the Cookhouse, this time for lunch. I asked Liam who was on duty what he'd recommend and he was spot on. Bacon and Emmental Cheese on Flat bread. It was delicious.  

There was some building work taking place while I was there and I think its a sign of the times. From walking around the City Centre I don't think you can walk down a street where there's not work taking place. I'm excited to see one of my favourite hotels getting the transformation it deserves. It was always good, but its improving visit on visit.   

The staff even from their presentation obviously take a lot of pride in their work, and their workplace, they have a friendliness often lost in city centre hotels and restaurants. Everyone of them I met were smiling, and made an effort to make conversation, and during my entire stay there wasn't so much as a cigarette butt on the pavement outside the hotel. 

As someone who works in the hospitality industry I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, its simply fantastic and the staff are a credit to the place. I will definitely return as soon as possible.",5,2016,12,03
219,All the gear but no idea!,"We started our honeymoon at the North Star Hotel and had booked a premier King with access to the hospitality suite. Started off well as we were allowed to check in early, which is always handy. We viewed our room which was average, it had no balcony or private terrace but we knew that wasn't guaranteed, but we did have a lovely view of scaffold and a brick wall. We decided to have a look at the hospitality lounge but couldn't get access as the card wouldn't work, so after visiting the reception we were given another card, which we later found out didn't work again. We went for a meal in the restaurant on the evening which I must say was excellent with very attentive service. The nights sleep was ok, but we were awoken at 8am by drilling and hammering directly above our room which was far from ideal. After getting showered I went down to reception to again change the card for the lounge, which again didn't work, so on my 3rd visit to reception I was far from pleased. I spoke to the guy on reception again, but this time mentioned how unreasonable it was to have construction work happen at 8am waking guests up, but he said 'it'll be finished soon', which left me fuming. We promptly packed up and left immediately. Unfortunately we had prepaid for this poor excuse for a comfortable hotel stay! To summarise, average room, poor customer service, poor nights sleep, very expensive for what we received in what could be a nice hotel!",2,2016,11,30
219,Great hotel ,"Stayed here for one night, great location for O'Connell street, temple bar and 3 arena. Also on airport bus route! Looks shabby from outside but reception/public areas are stunning! Bedrooms are a great size with lovely big beds. Was surprised to see a train track right outside our window, tho trains didn't  start til 9 am on Sunday, so wasn't an issue. Room was very hot no air con and window only opened slightly. Also used the restaurant, not a great experience, but would defo use this hotel again/highly recommend! ",5,2016,11,27
219,Hen Party Stay - 3 Nights,"When I first looked at the reviews I was slightly concerned about the noise but we had 5 rooms and there was only 1 of them that ran right by the train track in the main building, couldn't ear any construction noise. The windows could be better to block out some of the noise. 
I stayed in room 103 and it looked out onto the main road at the front of the hotel, room and bathroom were very nice and clean, beds were a bit hard. Breakfast in the morning was good with a wide variety to choose from. Staff were very helpful and hotel is about 5 minute cab journey to temple bar. Overall stay was pleasant. ",4,2016,11,26
219,Close to the craic !,"Very clean and modern interior. City centre location opposite railway station within half an hour's walk of all major tourist sites.
All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, willing to spend time advising and helping us. This was really helpful as we only had a couple of nights in Dublin.
We did not have breakfast so cannot comment on that but we did have a meal in the hotel's restaurant one evening which was delicious and not too expensive.
All-in-all we would thoroughly recommend The North Star as a good city centre hotel and hope to return soon.",5,2016,11,22
219,Fantastic Find,"Highly recommend this hotel. Perfect location, reception staff were great, the bar is just right for drinks and some food after a day walking around Dublin.  The rooms were spacious and very clean, beds were comfy, I can't fault it. We're coming back to Dublin next year and I won't hesitate to book here again.",5,2016,11,22
219,Short break but disappointed ,"When we arrived I was fairly happy with how the hotel looked and it's location. We approached reception and introduced ourselves, the receptionist looked at reservations and said that we weren't booked with them. Luckily I had printed our booking which was made online. He looked at it and said yes we have you booked for one night. I pointed out that it was for two nights and he then agreed that. It felt that if we didn't have evidence then we wouldn't have been able to stay. 
He gave us two key passes (1 didn't work) and pointed us in the direction of the room. Not a great start. The room was fine and clean. No satellite TV but had wifi. Bed comfy. Staff friendly and lots available such as room service. Restaurant and bar looked great but quite expensive. Unfortunately the view outside our window was a building site which started work at 8am!",3,2016,11,22
219,A Great Place To Stay When In Dublin.,"Very friendly atmosphere and all the staff were very helpful. The Hotel has undergone a major refurbishment recently and a new block of rooms is due to open shortly. All the Bedrooms are comfortable and well fitted out, and the self service Breakfast is really excellent with a wide choice of food. Just the way to start a new day!! I'll certainly be returning.",5,2016,11,21
219,Fab Birthday Weekend,"Me and my boyfriend visited Dublin for my 21st Birthday. Prior to visiting my boyfriend rang the hotel to arrange the room (standard double room) to be decorated with balloons as a surprise for me. On arrival we had been upgraded to the premier suite with access to the premier lounge which was a lovely gesture for my birthday. The hotel itself is lovely and I can't fault it. The breakfast was delicious; all hot and fresh with a good choice from english cooked breakfast to continental. The hotel is around a 15 min walk to O'Connell st and 15 to Temple Bar area. Yes there was some building work going on during our stay but it didn't bother us too much. Staff were lovely and we couldn't have asked for a better stay!!
Thanks North Star",5,2016,11,21
219,"Great Hotel, Location and Food","Myself and my mother stayed here on the 18th November and were going to see Rod Stewart.  I was a bit apprehensive when I saw the dart above the hotel but I need not have worried as once in my room you would never have guessed.

From check in to check out our stay went smoothly.  The food was beautiful and as my mum is a coeliac it had great options food wise for her without any fuss which was a massive bonus.  

The biggest thing I thought was the shuttle to the 3arena...this was brilliant as I don't know Dublin well and it picked us up from right outside the hotel and dropped us outside the door of the arena hassle free and very reasonable.  

Definitely hoping to stay here again my mum is due to go to Andre Rieu on the 08.12.2016 and had booked another hotel which she is now going to change to here :)  Thanks to all the staff as they were very helpful",5,2016,11,21
219,"Lovely hotel, great location","We got a great deal and were pleasantly surprised at how lovely the hotel was. Nice and quiet, spacious rooms and a short walk away from the main shops and bars. Staff were very friendly and helpful. We didnt eat in the hotel so this review is based on the accommodation only.",5,2016,11,19
219,Average,Service was great and all staff seemed to be helpful however beds were uncomfortable and there was a mouldy smell throughtout the hotel. Gym was very small. Its s good location as walking distance to the msin area. I didn't pay too much so it wasn't too bad. If you are only there for one or two nights would be sufficient. It wasn't horrible but wasn't impressive either.,3,2016,11,19
219,a great Dublin experience,"Nice accommodations, but what made it such a fun place to stay was the people. The staff was super helpful and shared with us everything we needed to know to get around and enjoy Dublin. Our favorite was Dale--was he a concierge? not sure--who really went above and beyond the call of duty. His directions, recommendations, and insights went a long way to making our visit worthwhile. Loved the guy.

Full disclosure: we got upgraded so that our stay included use of the 7th floor lounge, including its daily continental breakfast. This was great, and it probably happened because we were there during the off season. Also, can't vouch for the price exactly because we went there as part of a package, but the price of the package was certainly reasonable.",5,2016,11,18
219,Not what was expected,"Aside from no breakfast in lounge opposite the James Joyce Suite as promised, the coffee machine was broken.  (I even called the front desk to explain - they were not going to send anything up.  We went out for breakfast instead - easier) The shower flooded the floor in the bathroom, my husband had to shore up the shower door with a wash cloth. Parking a real problem, have to find parking a distance away and coordinate bag drop off, better with 2 people. Very friendly staff though. Not going back.",2,2016,11,17
219,An Excellent Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"One of the greatest advantages of the North Star Hotel is its proximity to the centre of Dublin and the areas surrounding O'Connell Street. The hotel staff are extremely polite, helpful and efficient. As regards the Breakfast buffet, it catered to all tastes and was well presented. The room which I stayed in during my stay in the North Star was functional and indeed extremely comfortable. On my last evening, I was able to use the restaurant in the North Star, and the meal which I had was up to gourmet standards, but was cheaper than a burger which I had in a pub close to the Royal Canal. Actually, my stay at the North Star was one of the highlights of my visit to the Irish capital in early November, and is in my opinion, a highly recommended place to stop in, during a trip to Dublin!",5,2016,11,16
219,Disappointed for price ,Hotel is lovely from the outside through the reception and restaurant. However I was disappointed with the room. We were on the ground floor so I understand there not being a view but the room was a lot smaller and more basic looking than the photos would suggest. Nice and clean but the room was not worth ‚Ç¨200 a night in my opinion. Reminded me of a travel lodge / premier inn when I was expecting more based on the photos shown. ,3,2016,11,16
219,friendly staff,"never meet so many friendly staff  from the time we entered the hotel till we left, 
hotel was very clean  with the room been very spacious ,  breakfeast  staff were very helpful  with the food been of a high standard",5,2016,11,15
219,"lovely staff, pity about the building works","Have stayed here numerous times. its an ideal location especially if travelling to the 3 arena or Aviva stadium, I even proposed to my wife here :). Staff are great, Rooms are lovely. Only annoying thing was the building works right outside our room. the scaffolding literally joined to our balcony. I know there's nothing that can really be done but would have taught maybe a discount or some hotel credit might have been offered.",4,2016,11,15
219,lovely lunch with the girls,"We came to dublin last week for a girly day and we went to the north star hotel for lunch its just across the road from the main train station.
We had a really friendly waiter keith who was telling us the best dishes and dish of the day we had the winds and sandwhich of the day and a good few white wines the whole experience was brillant and the staff where so friendly and professional .",5,2016,11,14
219,Weekend stay,"Room was beautiful modern and spotless , stayed bed and breakfast , price was very good and restaurant again very clean a good variety of food. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again. Thankyou",5,2016,11,10
219,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"Stayed here with my friend for the weekend while visiting Dublin for the first time. We got a really good deal so was not expecting to much from this hotel. When we arrived in the morning the reception staff were lovely and attentive and our room was all ready which we were also not expecting ( about 10am ). Normally check in times are lunch time/ afternoon. The rooms were big, comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. 
The concierge was lovely! He had a good laugh with us and helped us out with the best ways in which to get to the different places we wanted to go.  
Looking at other comments, people have said the area was not very good but I have to say we were unaware of that and even walking home in the dark we did feel perfectly safe. It was also pretty central to town and next the the train station.
Would really recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin. 
",5,2016,11,10
219,VERY GOOD,"I have been staying in 3 hotels in Dublin ( Hilton Garden - Spence) over the last 2 months and this with out doubt this is the best 

On the outside it looks like it will be noisy as its on the main rd but has you walk in it all changes

The decor is really good as is the reception staff

I had a room on the 6th floor and it was modern clean and had everything and more than you needed

The breakfast was very good we upgraded to a full irish which was fresh and the breakfast staff are really good

I had a meal at the bar (pasta) and it was superb 

Really good hotel & I am back next week",5,2016,11,09
219,Accommodating and friendly ,"The hotel staff was the greatest asset this hotel has going for it. Friendly and accommodating, always looking to help in any way they can. The hotel is clean, though it needs updating in the rooms, but overall good value. Some repairs to the rooms are subpar, for instance repairs had been done to the tub in the room and screws were actually sticking out of the tub next to the floor. There is construction going on next to the hotel so depending on the room you have it can either be disruptive or no problem at all, until construction is complete i would recommend being sure to have a room away from the construction. Location of the hotel was perfect for us, about 10-15 minute walk to temple bar if you're looking for that scene and some great local pubs close by the hotel. Overall I absolutely recommend the hotel and would stay here again.",4,2016,11,07
219,Convenient hotel - 4 stars!,"We were fortunate to stay in a family room at this hotel - 1 bed for mom and dad and 2 single beds for the children. The room was nice, perfect for a short stay. The breakfasts daily were excellent! The gym/sauna were above average. Restaurant/bar adjoining the hotel had good food and a family friendly atmosphere. We stayed for a total of 4 nights and would stay there again.",4,2016,11,07
219,Great hotel in a good location,"We stayed here for my Husbands birthday weekend, loved the hotel,
Reception are so friendly & helpful, we were given a free upgrade to the 7th floor which has a complimentary lounge where you can get water, fresh coffee, tea, biscuits - even yoghurt & croissants in the morning.
Bedrooms were modern & spacious - really comfy huge bed!
Would definitely stay here again - 2 nights wasn't long enough",5,2016,11,07
219,Good Quality and Centralized Location for the Price!,"We truly enjoyed our stay in this hotel.  We step out of the hotel and immediately immersed in the Dublin culture and hustle-bustle.   WE LOVE IT!!!! We particularly give kudos to two front desk employees and breakfast attendant that made our stay memorable, they are: Lara and Julia from front desk and Sara from breakfast room.  Thank you all for a GREAT stay.  We truly recommend this place!!!!!",5,2016,11,07
219,"Horrible stay, no sleep past 7am","The main hotel was lovely. However, the shower in our room was poor and when you sat down on the toilet, it lived off the wall. The view from our window was a construction sight with men walking around, therefore we had to keep our curtains shut our whole stay. The construction work, including loud tools and sawing began at 7am, it was impossible to sleep past this time. Having paid over ¬£150 for 1 night, I was extremely disappointed, we will not be back!!",2,2016,11,07
219,The only down side is ,"The hotel was beautiful the staff were very friendly and attentive Area not so good but it is close to the city centre. Only down side is the hotel is practically located right next to a steady train track so can be loads of noise and make room shake. 
The bar/restaurant attached was a good atmosphere and host and staff were friendly 
But overall enjoyed it ",4,2016,11,06
219,Why is the food unremarkable?,"It does not cost much more to provide fresh juice instead of reconstituted drinks. Likewise the preparation of eggs was very average
The room was small but clean and useable
The hotel location was good",4,2016,11,04
219,"Decent Hotel, not the best area of Dublin","The Hotel is pretty good. The rooms are decent, there is a good gym, and the breakfast was lovely. The adjoining bar was also really good, and didn't feel at all like a typical hotel bar. It had a good bit of atmosphere. The only downside is that the location isn't the nicest in Dublin. Quite a few people mentioned that we were close to some rough streets, and that we should be vigilant in the surroundings. The local area did seem to have a few shady characters, and certainly it was an edgier part of Dublin. That said, traveling in groups or by cab would be fine, and I have seen far worse in nearly every other corner of the world.",3,2016,11,03
219,Wonderful Dublin Hotel ,"We spent three nights at The North Star Hotel and had a very nice experience there. The staff, in particular Julia, who was absolutely outstanding. One point should be made when selecting room location. There are some locations in the facility that more quiet than others so be sure to request those areas. We will definitely revisit this hotel.",5,2016,11,03
219,Average at best,"Stayed here for 2 nights, and during our stay we had 3 different rooms.
Firstly, it must be said the staff on reception were brilliant, however...
We originally booked for a standard room, which was large enough, lovely and clean and the bed was very comfy! However, we had a lack of hot water. Upon asking about this, we had our room upgrading to premier and porters even moved our luggage for us as we were heading out! 
Premier rooms are fabulous, great views from the balcony! However,  neither of us slept well and we're woken at 5am by a noise from the corridor. So loud it vibrated the room. When we asked about this, it was decided it was the main air conditioning unit. 
Again, we were moved rooms. Again, very nice room.
Its just a shame that after paying nearly ‚Ç¨350 for a 2 night stay, there were so many issues. If it wasn't for the staff, rating would be much lower. I would not stay again, which is a shame as we can't wait to return to the city! ",3,2016,11,03
219,Good hotel,"The location of this hotel is great. Close enough to most attractions etc. Near to tram stops but we just walked everywhere. The Airlink 747 bus to and from the airport stops very nearby. There are also plenty of handy corner shops and takeaways very close by. It is quite noisy outside though, lots of traffic all night long.

The staff at the hotel are all really nice and helpful. Especially one man who gave me directions to the bus stop and even walked me to the door so that he could point and show me where it is and then checked the times for me without me even asking.

Room was good and clean, looked lovely. Plenty of wardrobe space and coat hangers for a short stay (we stayed for two nights). Tea and coffee making facilities and a free safe. Bathroom looked lovely and was clean. There were free toiletries in there and lots of towels. Two slight negatives. The pillows were incredibly hard meaning I had quite a poor night's sleep and also one night the shower wouldn't get warm enough. Waited and waited in case it was someone else in another room showering that was making it cold but after about half an hour I just had to have a lukewarm shower. 

Breakfast was great, especially the pancake machine! The selection is amazing, quality mostly good - although some things were a bit cold. It was also not too busy. Only slight complaint here is that the waitresses were a bit slow to offer tea or coffee.

Would probably stay here again but the hard pillows have put me off a little as a hotel should provide a good night's sleep which I didn't get.",4,2016,11,03
219,Good quality breakfast üç≥üçû,"Bedroom area and bed itself are very clean and comfortable. 

However I would have given a 4‚≠êÔ∏èbut the bathroom is dated and in need of a little TLC. Also takes ages for the warm water to come through but when it does the shower head is slow and desperately needs changing. 

Location is ok with a good 15/20 minute walk to Temple Bar. 

Staff are friendly and welcoming. However breakfast is by far the highlight. All food warm and very good quality. ",3,2016,11,02
219,North Star is a star,"We had a double stay at the North Star hotel. Our first night we were welcomed by a great from desk crew. We had bought a package deal from a travel agency and weren't sure what to expect. The ""family"" room was simple, clean and an interesting set up. Two twin beds planking a queen bed(would have been great if we had little ones with us), but was perfect for each of our suitcases. Breakfast was included and was more than enough choices and well prepared. 
A wonderful receptionist, Kristina, was a breath of fresh air, with her personal attention and pleasant attitude. The concierge, also gave great recommendations! 
We actually had three additional nights at the NSH at the end of our trip, and all of our wonderful experiences were reinforced, and would come again. 
",4,2016,11,01
219,fantastic,"we stayed here for the last part of our silver wedding anniversary for 2 great nights. cant say enough.  the staff were great and the room was huge. the bed was unbelievably huge and comfortable,  had a lovely letter and box of chocolates from the hotel for our anniversary. the breakfast was delicious.  not much of a view but  you don't go to Dublin to look at a view from your room.  
great hotel look forward to going back. üòÜ",5,2016,11,01
219,Weekend away,"This hotel is fantastic for a short or long break, it local (walking distance) to all that you could want. We enjoyed the morning breakfast which provides various types such as, a cooked breakfast, cereals, fruit and pancakes if you which. The hotel looks amazing and all the staff are welcoming and friendly. I will be booking with this hotel again",5,2016,11,01
219,Building work right outside of our room,"The hotel reception area is well decorated and room was clean

However if i could rate this hotel nothing i would. (but trip advisor doesn't allow it) The staff were incredibly condescending, immediately sold upgrades and breakfasts and told we wouldn't get a better deal anywhere else. As soon as we declined, it was an abrupt pay now please for the room. Although the hotel reception area is nice, as soon as you enter the room section, its nothing more than a travel lodge. Our room decor was outdated, small, and the walls are paper thin, to the point where I could hear ""our neighbors"" on the toilet. The worst part about this stay was there was building works happening directly outside of our room. Every morning we woke up to an insane amount of noise; drilling, banging, shouting - the works. We had to keep our curtains drawn the whole time because builders would see us change. We tried to spend as little time there as possible. We barely slept whilst there. Originally booked this hotel because it looked modern and great for a special occasion. It was not. The photos are incredibly misleading and you are most definitely not getting value for money. I grossly overpaid and the hotel is not worth it. I would strongly recommend NOT staying here.

This hotel has an expensive price tag without any of the qualities that justify it and I am really very cross because I feel massively ripped off.",1,2016,11,01
219,Really nice Hotel,"We stayed here with friends on a tour of Ireland,  It was a great stay with comfortable beds and the people there where absolutely the best!! we got in early and our rooms where not ready yet. we where real tired from the flight and really had no where to go. the staff was very accommodating to us.
the room we had was a view of the school dorms next door and the city. the bed,room,bathroom all top notch.
the bed and full size pillows very comfortable !
the breakfast was nice with a variety of different things to eat.
you are not far from transportation and near the city the normal tours and such are also within a stride away. I recomend  the bus system,or tram for any long distance.",5,2016,11,01
219,Colm the concierge so helpful,"A brilliant hotel with excellent staff, the service was first class in every detail....highly recommended,  I look forward to returning one day soon. The location was also really handy by being so close to the trains, trams and buses...",5,2016,10,30
219,Two days in Dublin,"Our family, along with our friends' family visited North Star Hotel for two nights, during our holiday in the UK and Ireland. It is definitely a four stars hotel, but it needs renovation... 
We have to admit, though, that NorthStar  Hotel has the most helpful staff!! Although we couldn't have our two rooms one next to the other, since we hadn't asked prior to our visit, the chief of staff did his best to arrange the most convenient booking; we had an upgrade at no charge!
We need to say a special thanks to Receptionist Julie, because every time we called reception, the sweet and kind Julie was there to assist us right away, with a huge smile!
We recommend North Star Hotel and we will visit it again, once we are in Dublin!",5,2016,10,30
219,Our visit to Dublin,"I went to the North Star Hotel last week, the staff were so friendly especially Colm at the front desk who helped us to find the best places to visit. The room was warm and kept clean every day, the Restaurant served really great food. Thanks for a great time, see you again.",5,2016,10,29
219,Quick break in Dublin,"Very nice hotel, well located opposite Connolly Station and near to everything in Dublin. Very friendly staff. Place was very clean. We did not opt for the breakfast as Dublin has loads of inexpensive places to get this. Plenty of shops around to buy provisions as well. Very clean. Only complaint (minor) was temperature of corridor, too hot. Nice bar attached where you are not obliged to eat, they were happy for us to go and get a drink even though busy with diners. Would recommend.",4,2016,10,29
219,Disappointing,"We were disappointed with this hotel - from the rooms to the location to the layout of the hotel.  

The hotel is a bit of a maze, and the views from the rooms appear to either look into a concrete courtyard or an alley with dumpsters.

The room was clean however, and the breakfast was good.

We would not stay here again.",2,2016,10,27
219,Shining bright in Dublin City Centre,"So impressed with this place! I am from Dublin and did not know Mcgettigans now have it ! I was there with my mum for a pizza and some drinks. The atmosphere is great and interior design is beautiful. The thing I was most impressed with was the friendly and knowledgable service by David our waiter. I can't wait to go back, and have a longer visit, I should also mention its suitable for all ages, had a great cocktail and beer list, and a very impressive menu.",5,2016,10,27
219,Nice two night stay,"My partner and I have just come back from a two night stay at this hotel.
This hotel was in the prime location for us. We travelled by bus (747) from the airport and the bus stop was literally round the corner from the hotel which was perfect. It is only a short walk away from the main high street and bars. 
From the outside the hotel doesn't look anything special but from the moment you step in it is well decorated and we were greeted by welcoming staff. 
Our room was on the ground floor. We couldn't really fault the room as such, it had all the facilities you'd expect from a four star. Our only negative would be that our room was facing some building work outside. Because we had an action packed couple of days planned this didn't really effect us as we weren't in our room for much of the day.
Previous comments mentioned about noise from the trains; again this didn't bother us as we weren't in our rooms for most of the day, but we were woken at 7am with the noise of the building work. Again this didn't bother us as much as we wanted to be up early with planned activities. 
We had continental breakfast included with our stay which was substantial and pleasant. 
On the last night we dined at their restaurant which was lovely.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We would recommend staying at this hotel and if we were to visit Dublin again, we will be sure to come back.",4,2016,10,26
219,"No Sleep, bad service and poor hotel","We booked the hotel for a long weekend break to Dublin on the premise that we wouldn't be spending a great amount of time there but it would be a good place to base ourselves with the home comforts you would expect from a half decent hotel. 

Unfortunately what followed was nothing short of a shambles. Our room was located on top of one of Dublins busiest stations which although I wasn't that fussed by the view the noise that followed was unbearable. The trains finished around midnight and begun at 6am leaving very little time where it was possible to sleep. 

This was only the beginning of the noise issues as around 7am the building work began. This constant banging and drilling made the noise from the station seem almost therapeutic. We were not pre warned about any renovation work before our stay and it did not appear to be close to completion. 

If the two above were not enough to wake you up in the morning you can look forward to the cleaning staff who although are extremely polite begin their work around 8am. Although well intended I am sure they bang broom ends against doors and walls and crash their trolleys around like its a destruction derby. 

Although the noise was the most significant issue it was by no means the only one. The bed might as well have been concrete and the pillows breeze blocks and the shower appeared to be designed for guests under 5 ft (I am 6ft 2 and it was fixed below my chest). The 'concierge' was a little rude and the staff lacked the customer service skills that you would expect from a decent hotel. 

We didn't get the breakfast as the brunch around Dublin is pretty good and cheaper than the hotel. 

Wouldn't go near this hotel again, they need to invest in some serious money sound insulation and training for their staff.",1,2016,10,25
219,New hotel wing replaces car park,"Basic room on ground floor this time in new wing which has been built on the car park between the original and second wing. Some building work still in progress but not intrusive. Ten minute stroll to O'Connell Street. Minutes to train, rail and tram stops.

Spotlessly clean but snagging list necessary for finishing touches. New reception is a feature - built under the arches of the railway which passes through the complex. 

Even in reception the trains are not heard. Nearest parking is now at the Connelly Rail station - nine euros per day.

Thanks for a hassle free break to reception staff for holding bags for half a day prior to check-in and half a day prior to return flight. Special thanks to Julia on reception and Sean, Shane and Dominic in the hotel bar. Sorry to miss Paddy! Will be back yet again.",5,2016,10,25
219,Good stay,"Check in/check out 

Check in/out was fine - no problems. The front desk staff were all really nice and helpful. 

Rooms: it seems that there are two buildings. We were given a room that is on the same building as the reception. There is no elevator, so if you have a lot of luggage, be mindful of this. The room that we were in was fine, not big issues. Noise was not a problem for us, even with the train station in front of us. It would have been nice if they had a mini fridge to stock beverages. Bed was comfortable. 

Location - it is about a 20-30 min walk to temple bar district. There are stores close to the hotel in case you want to buy food/snacks. ",3,2016,10,25
219,Not four star avoid ,"Booked for one night for a last minute trip to Dublin with work and no others hotels had availability. 

190 euro for a room only in a premier room. Twin beds and the beds seemed very small.  Room nice but on the small side and on top floor but heating could not be controlled and so room was scorching and opened the balcony door to let cold air in to find a buiding site behind. Water presure for shower or bath very very poor.

Premier lounge only offered hot drinks out a machine and ginger biscuits not very exiting.

Paid for breakfast the next morning to find food cold and bits of dont know what in the fruit juice. 

I would suggest you avoid as hotel also on very busy street so the niose of traffic and police not the most welcome and the staff not the most welcoming or prepared to deal with issues.",1,2016,10,25
219,Great time!,"Booked via internet for five girlfriends  to celebrate two of us turning 50. We were thrilled to be told our rooms had been upgraded! The rooms were lovely, clean and comfortable. The staff were polite and friendly. None of us were troubled by train noise. Overall we were very impressed with the hotel and would definitely recommend it. Not far to walk to all the attractions, but there is a taxi rank and train station just outside the hotel, also a tram stop round the corner if you need transport.",5,2016,10,24
219,The only good thing was location,"This hotel has a great, very central location, which is a plus. But, the parking is ridiculously far away and its price is not included in the cost of the room. The room I was assigned to was far from nice. The beds were terrible, I don't think we slept at all. The proximity to the city centre just made for loud street noise. It was by far the most disappointing place I've ever stayed.",2,2016,10,24
219,not 4*,"Stayed here last week for a short break for my birthday.  Booked it through lastminute.com and was swayed by the location and also the look of the rooms and views.  Location wise it is very central, approximately 5/10 minute walk to O'Connell Street and just down from the bus station.  The hotel was going through some work which we weren't aware of until we arrived and whilst the noise was fairly minimal it did disrupt us on our last day when the builders were banging on the floor below us from 8.15 onwards.  Our room was the main let down.  We booked a classic double but were given a family room which was a let down d√©cor wise as it felt dated especially compared to the pictures of double rooms on the website, also the description and pictures used promoted the fact that the hotel had amazing views, which again we didn't get and I suspect only applied to the premier rooms which were on higher levels.  Our room was to the rear of the hotel and overlooked a street, the window itself didn't seem to close fully or the seal was gone as even when shut (and it was slammed shut to ensure it closed!) you could still hear the noise of the traffic and people walking passed and also the wind.  The bathroom whilst adequate also felt dated, the light above the mirror was wonky as was the wood underneath the sink.  The lighting in the room is also terrible, only side lights and a small pretty useless light above the mirror.  Also it would appear that you cannot control the temperature in the room despite there being the console for the air con which it would have been nice to do as sometimes it was too hot and on other occasions too cold.  On the upside there was a safe within the room which was handy.  The staff seemed very friendly and the bar attached looked nice though we never used it nor did we eat breakfast here as it was an additional cost with our package.  You can leave your bags with them securely if you need to which we found very useful as we had to check out by 11.30 but weren't flying until the evening.  Could be nice and I suspect the premier rooms are the ones to go for.",3,2016,10,24
219,Amazing time,"We had an absolutely amazing time here for our honeymoon.  The front desk staff was wonderful.  They helped us book two dinner reservations to get into two restaurants that fill quickly during dinner time.  They had wonderful recommendations for tours and sites to see while in Dublin.  The staff remembered us each night and would ask if we had enjoyed dinner or a tour.  We also enjoyed drinks at the bar both nights after getting back from the Temple Bar area.  Sean and Dominic were wonderful bartenders.  Both were funny and talkative.  The room had a very comfortable bed and was very clean.  We ended up getting upgraded for our honeymoon to a room with a small balcony and it was nice to step out and see a few views of Dublin.  This is a very nice hotel situated within walking distance from some of the main Dublin attractions and shopping, but be ready to pay for a tour bus or rail to get to Guinness or the further attractions.  The staff really made this hotel experience the best.  We appreciated the friendly and helpful attitude from the moment we checked in to the moment we left for the last time.  We would absolutely stay again.",5,2016,10,23
219,Long weekend break ,"Me and my wife thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was very comfortable and emaculatly clean. The food was so good with a nice verity to choose from. The staff helpfull and polite. 10 out of 10 all round
",5,2016,10,23
219,Five nights in a noisy hole,"My company booked this hotel. Just took a look at the website it seemed ok. The firts disappointment for me was that breakfast was not included. Ok, could have been my mistake, but in my past 20 hotel stay i have never met this situation. It is a 4* hotel, but the room itself is a hole. Small with bad quality materials. But the big problem was the nois. The aircon itself was really noisy it was difficult to chose between the nois and the cold. Some previous guest complained of the trains and the nois if the nearby construction work. I agree, it is more than acceptable. My room was at the level of the stree and with a view to the construction... The staff was anyway friendly and the wifi is ok.",1,2016,10,23
219,Pleasant attentive staff BUT the facilities need updating ,Stayed here on business. Room comfortable enough and staff attentive and helpful. But the facilities were basic and there was building work ongoing when I was there. Continental breakfast uninspiring! So thank you staff but I would not return ,3,2016,10,22
219,"Restaurant review, absolutely fabulous!","Myself and my partner had been looking for a place to eat one evening and decided to give this place a go! From the moment we walked in we were truly impressed! The service was just fantastic, very friendly and genuine staff! The food was just amazing and the timing was efficient. I had the salmon and it was just delicious üòç after I had a berry cheesecake and omg was just beautiful, the best I've ever had! Will definitely be returning here for a meal, the restaurant is so cosy as well, really nice ambiance! It was also lovely to see the manager walking around asking customers how they were doing and how the meal was etc, thank you for a great evening! ",5,2016,10,22
219,"Only two nights, not enough","We thoroughly enjoyed our stays. We arrived on Sunday for our first night in Ireland, and returned on Friday for our final night in Ireland. Very nice accommodations, kingsized bed, bathrobes and slippers provided.  Location cannot be beat, across the street from Connolly Station, so getting anywhere in Dublin is a snap. On site restaurant is McGettigans Cookhouse Bar, a very enjoyable place to relax and have a great meal, or watch the locals watch a hotly contested football (soccer) match.",5,2016,10,21
219,Dr E Johnson ,"Centrally located
Nice 24 hour premiere lounge with 
Excellent coffees 
Very courteous front desk
Good service
Helped with tours
Called cabs and directed us on area to walk by and see.
For a first time visit to Dublin this was a good place to stay
Toured blarney castle. Did city tours and getting back to a comfortable and friendly hotel is a must. ",5,2016,10,20
219,Nice comfortable stay.,Hardest part of the stay was trying to get to park the car. The instructions we got from the staff to find the car park were vague to put it mildly. Even downloading a map to the phone didn't account for one way streets either. So it was the worse part of the stay. Anyways we stayed here for one night during the week with my friend in a twin room. Really comfortable sleep and nice and quiet. Bathroom was nice and clean and breakfast was delicious. Hotel would be perfect for any gigs at the O2 as the Luas runs right pat the hotel. Thumbs up from me.,4,2016,10,20
219,Terrible room for a Business trio,"As a light sleeper I always request a quiet room in a hotel. I was due to stay here for 3 nights and was meant to be given a Premier King room. 

Instead I was given a standard twin bed room, overlooking Amien St. (Connolly Station).  Worse than the windows that don't block out all the noise, the bathroom door that doesn't close properly, the room key that didn't open the door and necessitated a second trip to reception, was the room which was boiling on arrival right through to departure! The radiators were turned off already so it's obvious the hotel knew of the issue. There is a hot water tank/heating tank adjoining the room which meant the room was ridiculously hot, even with the windows open on arrival and all evening in the October cool air. That tank also fills the room with the constant hum of running water - a truly head wrecking sound.

The hotel are so accommodating that a half working desk fan is provided in the room to circulate the hot sticky air. And don't dream of leaving your window open once bedtime arrives with the outside noise!

The food is average for the City Centre prices. But the accommodation is extremely overpriced and shows that Dublin's lack of hotel rooms means even abysmal rooms can command a high price. That room is 207 for any unlucky readers who find themselves staying there.

My only saving grace was that due to a change of plans I only stayed one night (booking was amended within hotel's timelines for same just in case anybody thinks my poor room was karma). I shall not be staying again!",1,2016,10,19
219,Lovely central Hotel,"Stayed for 1 night on 14th October as it was close to 3 Arena and the bus station. Quick check in and were offered an upgrade to executive room for 30 Euro. Took a chance with room we had been allocated. It was super. 3 beds, large TV, hairdryer, tea and coffee facilities and a nice bathroom. Extra points for providing toiletries and decent shampoo and conditioner in the shower. Free WIFI. Location is great, beside bus and train station and nice dander to O'Connell Street. Our room was on the busy street side, but minimal noise... Had breakfast delivered to room and it was excellent. Well done North Star Hotel!!",5,2016,10,19
219,"Lovely staff, good location","Location is good for walking into town and is opposite train station and directly on airport bus route. The hotel has upgraded it's reception area since our last visit and is a welcoming entrance to hotel with staff that are very helpful and friendly. The room had been recently upgraded - very clean and super comfy bed, however, the overall finish in bathroom was not to a great standard - some snagging needing done by hotel operations. Although, there was building work going on as the hotel continues it's refurbishment, there was limited noise and we were not disturbed by this or traffic in any way.
The bar/bistro is a lovely space to eat/drink in and the staff are very accommodating - especially Shaun, who remembered us from previous visits.",4,2016,10,18
219,"Having read some of the reviews, very pleasantly suprised!","I recently attended a conference at the Convention Centre followed by an evening black tie event at Croke Park.  I selected the North Star Hotel because of its prime location, particularly in relation to these venues and a professional recommendation.  I was certainly not disappointed.  

I have passed this hotel on numerous occasions but never had reason to go in. From entering the hotel I had a lovely warm feeling and the recently refurbished reception area is beautiful and restored in a very sympathetic manner reflecting the age of the property. I was greeted by the reception staff in a very courteous and friendly manner (apologies I cannot remember the gentleman's name).   

My room was a restored room, in the original section of the hotel which was spotlessly clean and presented beautifully.  On returning from Croke Park I had a night cap in the bar and had some great banter with the very friendly barmen.

The selection at breakfast was vast and everything appeared to have been freshly prepared/cooked which is always a bonus. While waiting in the lobby I spoke with a beautiful lady who is the accommodation manager (Sharon I think), she explained about the large scale redevelopment which is on-going and looks amazing. As an engineer by profession, I am amazed how they have been able to keep such a perfectly functioning hotel operational during a large scale redevelopment, with what appears to be minimal disruption.  Looking forward to my next visit, hopefully for leisure this time. . . . . .",5,2016,10,18
219,"Bit noisy, somewhat dated","The North Star hotel is well situated, close to the river and at about 1.5 km from the centre. Staff is friendly and efficient and for example helped me wonderfully with a print job. 
I stayed in the old part of the hotel, with my room bordering Amiens Street. Unfortunately I found my room to be quite noisy, even with all windows closed. Much traffic on the road even in the middle of the night, and a clanking manhole on passing of cars. The first night it made me sleep badly, then I got used a bit. The bed was of good quality, as was the bathroom. Wifi worked well. The corridors look somewhat aged. The continental breakfast I had was OK (personnel friendly as well), but not above average: no fresh juices, no bowls of yoghurt but just packaged yoghurt. For the price I think it should do a bit better.",3,2016,10,16
219,"Wonderful Service, excellent staff, nice hotel.","I visited this hotel with a friend of mine and we were booked in for three nights, departing 13th Oct. Very friendly greeting upon arrival, allocated room 109. This was a very nice room with a large recently updated bathroom. TV, tea facilities, nice toiletries etc. However I was disturbed throughout the night by the loud traffic noise outside. We faced the main road at the front of the hotel and that coupled with people accessing the main railway station opposite meant lots of traffic. This is the older part of the hotel with old style windows that I presume cannot be changed. I visited reception the next morning and when asked if I was well I explained that the noise had kept me awake, I asked if we were able to change to a room located at the rear of the hotel. This was agreed immediately. We left our packed cases in the room and were told they would be moved to a new room for when we returned. When we did return only a short while later (I had forgotten something!) we had already had our luggage moved to another room on the 4th floor in the rear newer section of the building. This room was in fact a suite for 4 people. It was amazing, there was also a letter of apology and a box of chocolates! the room had a spa bath, a double and twin room, a kitchenette and dining/seating area, a total of 3 tv's (one in each bedroom and one in lounge area) as well as a cooker, hob, microwave, fridge, kettle and even a washer/dryer. It really was lovely and despite workmen working on the extension to the hotel during the daytime when we were out, it was very quiet at night. There is a well equipped gym in the hotel should you feel the need to exercise, I didn't. There is also a sauna which we tried briefly, very nice and would have used again if we had more time. We did not eat in the hotel instead choosing to eat out and about whilst we toured the city. Although we did pop into the bar area one day and it was very busy and the food looked and smelled delicious. The reception area is located in an area converted under an original railway arch which was lovely, well appointed and clean. The most positive aspect of the stay was the way we were treated by the wonderful staff. They could not do enough to assist in any way they could and dealt with all our questions efficiently. We left our bags after check out and collected later and again excellent speedy service by the reception staff. This hotel is presently undergoing renovation with the building of new rooms. Do not let it put you off it does not impact upon your general stay. However ask for a room that does not face the main road if you are a light sleeper. We would return if visiting again.",4,2016,10,14
219,"Good location, until you get into your room","Within walking distance to City Center and many area attractions. Nice lobby and common areas. Our room sucked. We had a reservation for 2, a couple, but were given a room with 3 beds. No room to move inside. I had to step outside to change my mind. 

The AC fan made so much noise, that I thought a cat was trapped inside the blower. The alternative was to open up a window, which meant that we had to deal with a very close, elevated train going by every five to ten minutes. Neither was acceptable. We were offered an upgrade to a premier suite for 30‚Ç¨ per night, but one night was already booked, so we couldn't stay there for that one night, and would require having to change rooms back and forth each day. 

No refrigerator in rooms, so forget about keeping your medicine cold. No ice machines either.  Oh, and the plumbing is built above floor level, so the toilet never flushes properly, and you may need a step ladder to get into the tub/shower. Not a good place for physically challenged or elderly persons, or if your wife is grossed out by seeing a nasty toilet after you've flushed. 
I would not ever stay here again.",3,2016,10,12
219,nice place,"This was a pretty nice place. WIFI good. 

As other reviews said it was a bit noisey. Train station just across the street. Every floor seemed to have a different bad smell. No on site parking so you have to park a bit of a ways away. Parking was 8.00 a day 

Staff were very friendly.",3,2016,10,10
219,nice room shame about the noise!,"The room was very nice, big, clean and spacious and had been newly redecorated. However unfortunately what the website didn't inform us at the time of the booking was that building work was taking place at the hotel. On arrival we were offered a choice of rooms which were either to be on the ground floor facing the building work or over looking the main road opposite the railway station. We chose the main road option! As you can guess.. it was was very noisy as the windows are only double glazed and also you can hear the trains rumbling through until midnight and then starting again before 6am. 
All staff were friendly and helpful but the noise ruined our stay.",2,2016,10,09
219,Disappointed ,"Very old fashioned furniture in room for the price, had a very unsettled sleep as fire alarm went off in the early morning,  certainly not value for money. However the staff seemed very polite and friendly.
",3,2016,10,08
219,Good stay,"Decent hotel, close to Connolly Station. The breakfast buffet was average. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was a decent size, the bed very comfortable. A nice short walk to Upper Connolly St where the Hop-on Hop-off tours start.",4,2016,10,08
219,Absolutely the best!,"My boyfriend and i got into Dublin airport and hour early and made our way to the Northstar. When we arrived (at 3:30am) Martin greeted us and explained that unfortunately they were full at the moment due to the Gaelic Football game the night before and that he would get our room ready first thing as soon and guests started leaving. In the meantime he gave us a guest card to access the gym locker rooms so we could clean up and change clothes. He then stored our luggage and gave us a key to the Premier Lounge so we could get a snack and sleep on the furniture which we did. Martin went above and beyond his job by American standards and made our first few moments memorable. Our rooms were ready by 11am and were just beautiful, clean, and homey. Definitely one of my top favorite hotels in Ireland.",5,2016,10,07
219,Avoid // Not as advertised,"I chose this hotel based on photos and location. Sadly the hotel was nothing like I expected. Indeed it is currently having major building work and right outside room 151 window.

I asked for a quiet room. The receptionist hesitated and I can see why. This hotel is wedged between a very busy road and a noisy railway.

Not a pleasant experience compounded by the builders starting at 6:45 am.",2,2016,10,05
219,Enjoyed our stay,"Me and my boyfriend visited Dublin in March and stayed in this lovely hotel. Very clean and superb staff who were super friendly and helpful. We found that the location of this hotel was perfect, close to the centre. Our room was very nice, clean and couldn't of really asked for a better stay. Only negative was our view but obviously it is a city and will be like a concrete jungle. Would stay again and recommend to travellers going to see the sights of Dublin. We actually ate in the hotels restaurant in the night time, it was delicious, would recommend.",5,2016,10,04
219,"Construction work & noise, DO NOT STAY HERE!","Construction work was going on right outside our window. It meant we had no view and they were still working at 6pm. They also began work with power tools at 7am, forcing us to wake up at this time- when the plan was to have a lovely relaxing morning in the hotel.

The hotel staff moved us to a new room and gave us a box of chocolates. But a box of chocolates means nothing when one of our two nights there was ruined. They did not offer us any form of refund even after further correspondence. 

Once moved the rooms looked like a run down old fashioned premier inn, definitely not worth the price paid.

The staff were friendly enough, but the stay was a bad one. Worst stay in a hotel I have ever had.",1,2016,10,04
219,Worst accommodations ever!,"Constant construction, bad neighborhood, noisy drunks and inconsiderate guests made my stay here intolerable. The hotel is NOT centrally located and is a good mile walk to attractions such as Trinity College, Grafton Street, Kilmainham Gaol and the National Gallery. In addition, the front desk staff consists of mostly overly formal, stiff, unhelpful people (with a couple of exceptions like Daniel and Colom) who smile while basically telling you to shove off. Because the hotel has a restaurant on the premises, outside food is not allowed. So, ""guests"" are either forced to eat at that overpriced restaurant (the food was awful....see review of McGettigan's) or risk leaving the hotel grounds after dark to walk to another restaurant away from the seedy neighborhood. I think I would have preferred staying at  Kilhainham Gaol.",1,2016,10,03
219,Avoid. Room 110,"Stayed here for  1 night 1st October a anniversary treat from our daughter , first impression looked good , room looked ok but felt very cold, scaffolding outside the dirty window train line outside sounded like some of the trains were coming through our room, ok it's close to the train lines guess we were just unlucky with the location of the room , we thought 1 night we can manage, but that night more noise herrendous we were either next to a boiler room or something constant droning noise enough to drive you insane !!!!!! On informing reception was told oh no idea what that could be ??? Great !!!!!! Breakfast was good , but while other people were shown to a table we were told to find any table they were offered tea or coffee we had to ask for ours !!!!! I'm sure there is good points to the hotel we just didn't see them , won't be returning.",2,2016,10,03
219,SO...SO,"This use to be a lovely old hotel, has changed quiet a bit due to renovation. Service was quite limited, with that said, the waitress was very efficient & friendly. The menu was varied if a bit expensive. The soup & bread was very good. A tiny mixer bottle of diet coke was ‚Ç¨3. Big pots of tea (teabags) that served 2, not sure of the price. 
Probably not a place I would put on my list of places to go in Dublin again since loads of other more interesting places in the immediate vicinity.",3,2016,10,02
219,50th birthday,I would go back again in an instant booked for a 3 night stay for my husbands birthday on arrival we where upgraded 2 a suit with birthday card and chocolates it was a lovely gesture I will definitely recommend this hotel 2 anybody the room was lovely and clean very large and warm the breakfast was faultless plenty 2 choose from an very warm which Is a real bonus,5,2016,10,02
219,Room 562 - nice visit needs improvment,"This hotel is lovely and the staff are very nice. 
There are a few changes and attention to detail that needs to be paid. In our room the air con was faulty and the tiles were loose which made a loud noise.

We got some free chocolates as it was our honeymoon, the room is very nice and the beds very comfy. The bathroom is very dark. At the moment the hotel is going through a refurbishment which is extremely loud and starts at 830am. The corridor to reception is damp and wet. Don't walk down here without shoes on as you will end up with wet feet. 

A lovely hotel and very central - however not worth the 200 euros a night. 
I think this is a fair review as the staff and hotel is lovely just needs TLC.

",4,2016,10,02
219,Terrible stay,"The hotel is on the north side of the River right across from the train station in a very undesirable area of town. The  20 minute walk to the city center proved quite the experience through rough and noisy streets. During the day was bad enough but at night is was scary. If you stay here and are not mobile and able to walk it could prove quite costly having to take taxis to all the sights Dublin has to offer.
The room was not bad and relatively clean. To get to the room you have to walk down a long,narrow hallway; like a tunnel. There are only 2 small elevators to take you up to your room. During our stay, only 1 was working. The room was unbearably hot; the AC was not working. It was 29 C. in the room! We had to open the patio doors and it was so noisy we could not sleep at all. One night, they turned off the power so even the fan they had provided us could not work. 
Also, the water was turned off for most of one day.
We have travelled quite a bit and this is probably one of the worst experiences we have had in a hotel. I do not know who writes some of these reviews, but  take it from me and do yourself a favour: Stay somewhere else and enjoy Dublin the way it deserves to be.
PS: for longer stays, they make you pay 'upfront' so you are stuck.",1,2016,10,01
219,"Too noisy, small room, not inpressed","Stayed here on the 26th of September after travelling from Las Vegas to Dublin had the room booked in advance for 4 people was not impressed at all. Arrived at the hotel around 8 checked in and went to our rooms. The room was tiny we could just about bring our suitcase into the room, at around 9 we decided to go down and get some bar food before going to sleep staff were nice on arrival however when we were sitting all we were listening to was the chef giving out and cursing horrible atmosphere straight away. The worst problem of all was the lack of sleep the next morning woke up to drilling and hammering shortly before 8 in the morning was not happy after a long day of travelling we just wanted to put our heads down and sleep this did not happen. On check out I said to a man at reception about the noise and about how we did not sleep well and he just passed it off with I'm very sorry about the noise. Not good enough I would not recommend staying here. It's a disgrace to pay money to sleep in a hotel right next to a building site !",2,2016,10,01
219,Wonderful staff terrible room,"Our room was unbearably hot, we had to sleep with the sliding door to outside open both nights. We were provided with a fan though. 

I complained after the first night and the manager on duty was nothing short of wonderful and made us feel much better about the place. We made it through night two. 

The Premier on the room description is misleading. I was sharing with my mum and we had expected a much bigger room. The shared sitting room on the 7th floor was great. The air conditioning worked in there! 
",3,2016,09,29
219,Noisy,We picked this hotel because we saw many good reviews on TripAdvisor. It is right across one of the city's train station. Unfortunately for us one of the elevated tracks ran by our room. So throughout the day and night you'd hear the train go by and quite loudly. I wish the hotel would invest in better sound proof windows to help lessen the noise. Also the housekeeping staff always popped the windows open while cleaning our room which I found irritating. They had construction outside and didn't want dust or whatever coming into our room. Lastly there is no elevator connecting the lobby to the 1st floor. This wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to carry out heavy luggage up a long staircase and through the maze like hallways. Of course our room was all the way down to the very end. Not the best way to end a long day of traveling. Overall we won't be coming back here.,2,2016,09,27
219,Wonderfull stay,"Lovely hotel situated  walking distance from the city center and facing the train station Connolly.
Great stuff helpful friendly.
They need to have more items for the breakfast.
The concierge is very helpful and his advises are great we enjoyed the trip discussion with him.",4,2016,09,26
219,Visit to Dublin 2-5 Sept 2016,"The hotel is quite strategically located, near the train station and less than 10 minutes walk to the center of Dublin. The service is excellent. The room is quite old but good amenities. The hotel rate is expensive though, not that worth the place. ",4,2016,09,26
219,Very very bad ! Pl read every line !,"We r 2 couples still residing in this famous expensive stupid North Star hotel besides the railway station. We have been sweating out in the night here as the air con is broken down.It has been giving out warm heated air. After shelving out so much money, one can't even sleep well. Called for a fan which has still not come! 

The bathroom is nice but the water flow sucks! Was not even able to wash hair ! 

Called for a soup at 10:30. Was told that the kitchen has closed and we can only get pizzas and sandwiches. On calling for a chicken club sandwich, we got a cold one which was not even cut into 2. They couldn't even grill it ! The salt pepper shakers were there but to my astonishment, they were totally empty. They are charging us 8 euros for a stupid bland Un appetising sandwich. 

The moment u step into the super expensive hotel , u get a feeling that ur here for a luxurious feel, but I'm telling u that my holiday inn express Manchester was quarter the rate of this but even came with a yummilicious breakfast included. It was worth every penny spent . This hotel is so poor that it can't even provide breakfast to its customers!

   Feeling completely cheated! Worst experience! Want a refund so badly ! A must avoid üò°",2,2016,09,23
219,Excellent location,"Stayed here for a few nights whilst working in Dublin, it's across the road from Connolly train station and very central for city centre. When you stay for business, they give you access to an executive lounge which is excellent - it has complimentary bottled watter, tea and coffee facilities and biscuits, as well as comfy sofas and a large TV. Wifi works well throughout the hotel. rooms spacious and very clean. Would highly recommend.",5,2016,09,22
219,PACKED TO THE DOOR,"Called in (again) last Sunday and wasn't disappointed a great pint , stout and cider  a warm friendly service and a first class meal what more could you ask for well besides a Mayo victory , roll on a week Saturday",5,2016,09,22
219,Modern hotel ,"Great hotel, booked 3 nights stay for my husbands birthday, arrived 8am, hotel looked after our luggage while we walked around Dublin, came back before room was ready and they gave us passes for premiere room, our double room was very spacious and clean, we ate at Mcgettigan's one night, food fantastic and fairy priced, would recommend and book again",5,2016,09,21
219,Lovely room shame about the noise,"We stayed one night at the North Star. We asked for a quiet room with a view. We were given a  ground-floor room  overlooking a' work in progress construction site'.   We complained but, were told that the construction workers would leave for the weekend and  it would be peaceful thereafter. However, if we wished to pay an extra 30E we could be up graded but we did not wish to incur an extra charge. We were  then offered Room 209 on the second floor, overlooking the busy front street below. This was a well appointed room with no air conditioning  but it did have a small portable fan instead. It did not have a lift. We had to leave early the next morning and miss breakfast but the hotel gave us a packed lunch instead. The hotel does not have a car park. Instead there is  public car park a five minute walk away and costs 9 euros per day.",2,2016,09,20
219,Superb,"We've stayed at the North Star on several occasion and love it.The minute we come in the door the atmosphere is relaxed,the staff are very welcoming and friendly.The rooms are comfortable,spotless and luxurious.Room service prompt.The resteraunt is well worth a visit,the food is excellent,varied and delicious.The premier rooms also have their own  shared large lounge area overlooking the city,with coffee machine,chilled water and  biscuits.A light breakfast can be had there too.I had mentioned we were celebrating my  partners birthday,and to my astonishment found we'd been upgraded to a suite.To say it had the OMG factor  is the best way I could cover a description.And also says a lot about the staff's kindness and thoughtfulness.Also the hotel is vert close to bus,tram and rail connection.Airport bus stops a few minutes away.Short stroll to city shopping centre.",5,2016,09,19
219,Needs attention,"Myself and 5 friends stayed at the north star from 15th to 18th of Sept.  We paid a good price for the pleasure so expected far better than we got. 
The location was quite good. Trains, pubs and restaurants all within a few minutes walk.
The bar on the ground floor was really good, friendly staff, and very knowledgeable about Dublin.
When we were able to check in we were given 3 double rooms all next to each other. Great start. The rooms were clean and tidy and had everything you could want when you only intend to use it as a base to SLEEP. Even though they were quite tired they were what we needed. 
So after our first evening out, we came back to the hotel for that sleep quite early as we had been on the road since the very early hours travelling. 
The rooms were on the ground floor next to a cobbled road and college so quite noisy. The room became very hot very quickly once the window was closed to block the noise of outside.The air con was extremely noisy and had NO heat settings only high or low fan speed. This was no use though, as the air it was pushing out was hotter than an oven. As we were trying to sleep the fire door in the corridor was being opened and closed every 15 to 30 seconds nonstop. The hinges were extremely noisy and squeaking then the closer on it would slam it shut. There was no let up on it. After a couple of hours of the heat and noise we could'nt stick it any more. My wife got dressed and went to reception to ask to change rooms. I stayed to pack the cases again. She came back with room keys for another room.  As we were about to walk down the corridor to another room the phone rang and the reception said not to go as there was a guest in that room. Close call for them and us. They offered us a room in staff quarters as it would be quiet for a few hours until the trains run again then it would be very noisy and also stated that the Aircon does not work in there either so they are very hot. The solution for the slamming,  squeaky door was to wedge it open. Bit naughty as it's a fire door but we did manage to get about 3 hrs sleep until people were getting up. Noisiest hotel I have ever experienced and I have stayed in lots. There is no sound proofing at all.
After negotiations with a couple of managers we were offered another room on the same corridor and ‚Ç¨80 back. I did push my luck and got breakfast for all 6 of us too.(that was not the point, I've never asked for a refund before)
However there was still no working air-conditioning and we could still hear the door,  just not quite as loud. The breakfast room was so hot we had to rush food and leave as our clothes were soaked with sweat.
I spoke with the manager and actually took him to the door and said about a little oil on the hinges and said a soft closer on top would solve that problem completely. However when I left 48hrs after that, they still had not managed even a little WD40 on the hinges. 
If you are going to stay at the north star, insist you're not on that bottom corridor around room 156. So many people need to walk past your  door while talking and the noise of the fire door made it impossible to relax and enjoy the stay. Due to the cobbles outside and the Air-conditioning being broken made the heat unbearable too. 
Sorry but I can't in any way recommend a stay here.",2,2016,09,19
219,"""fantastic stay""","From start to finish we had a fantastic stay @ The North Star Hotel  from taking the bus from the  airport  (Airlink Express) WHICH IS ONLY 10 Euros return which drops you round the corner from the hotel leaving you 2mins walk away only. We where greeted by two wonderful members of staff Ela & Krystyna on reception they was kind enough to take our cases etc as check was from 2pm was given maps & info.

when we returned to check in for our 2 nights b&b we was given a lovely room on the 7th floor with a balcony which had a view of the Aviva Stadium in distance. 

The bed was very comfortable room was spotless clean tea/coffee tray & fridge. Bathroom toiletries were very nice smell even shower cap was provided too. bath/shower bit on the  tight side but worked well plenty of clean white towels.

Breakfast was included with our room rate & we must say it was worth it excellent value for money  plenty of choice with a large variety we even  notice a pancake machine which you can make your own & watch them come out they looked very nice. sausages where of a very good quality bacon too was hash browns, mushrooms. black pudding & white pudding everything you could wish for was there :) enjoyed very much set us up for the day.

We was very pleased with the Hotel decorated very tastily& beautifully done  & all the staff that we came across were very friendly & helpfully We walked every where on foot easy to find where we wanted to go 
thank you for a fantastic stay. would definitely stay here again when we next come to DUBLIN

219,Would have got 5 stars but.......,"This hotel nearly had it all, great location, immaculately clean and tidy with high quality furnishings and a great bar with 5 star service! The only thing to let this place down badly was the fact it was so so hot!!! We stayed as a party of 5 over three rooms in completely desperate parts of the hotel, one room didn't have any aircon at all and the other two it was faulty which made for an extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant nights sleep. Breakfast is served in the basement restaurant and although there was plenty of choice and all good quality, again the room was stifling hot to the point where two of our party had to leave as they were beginning to feel unwell. I appreciate the place is going through a refurb but surely this shouldn't effect the heating? This issue was a real let down for what otherwise is a lovely hotel although I do think that our money could have been better spent somewhere that would have been far more comfortable. This review would have got 5 stars but I feel the issue with the heating had such an impact on what could have been a far more pleasant stay that I can only give it two. ",2,2016,09,18
219,Fantastic stay!,"What a great hotel in Dublin. We arrived early from an overnight flight from Canada and when we got to the hotel they had an upgraded room ready for us...so awesome. Great location lots to do and see, thanks north star for the great hospitality!!!",5,2016,09,16
219,Mr Paul Ellis,A decent hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Yes there is some train noise but what do you expect it by a station. Breakfast was a little bit expensive but you can eat as much as you won't. So no need for lunch The rooms where descent and a good standed It's a good central location for the city centre Would have no trouble stopping here again ,4,2016,09,14
219,A nice trip away!,"Just come back from this hotel this evening and thought I would write a review while it was fresh in my mind. We arrived on Saturday and booked a 2 night stay. Our flight got in very early so we were at the hotel around 10.30am knowing the check in time wasn't until 2pm. We sat in the lobby area and my partner who was feeling unwell after flying wasn't feeling the best. A gentleman at the lobby gave us a key to the premier lounge on the 7th floor so we could relax and enjoy a hot drink and some biscuits while we waited for the room to be ready which I thought was very good customer service. Check in was smoothly and we were given a lovely room on floor 5 (564). The bed was so comfortable one of the best I've ever slept in, the room was very clean. The shower pressure wasn't very good and the air con on our second night was awful. Me and my partner both couldn't sleep so we rang down to reception at 3am which a gentleman was up straight away to give us a fan. This worked wonders and then we enjoyed our sleep. The breakfast at the hotel was very nice, a good selection but a little salty for me.  The only down fall which I have read below is the cleaners in the morning. Helped themselves into our room where we were still lying in bed at 9am and then again a knock at the door at 11am. We knew check out wasn't until half 11 so we shouldn't of been bothered until then. Overall this did not put us off and we would definitely recommend this hotel. Great location and brilliant that they will look after your bags while you enioy your day before you travel back. Thank you north star. ",4,2016,09,12
219,Very impressed,"1 night stay for birthday. We were upgraded to a premier room with chocolates and a birthday card on arrival after I rang ahead. Room was very spacious, modern and clean with a balcony. Restaurant down stairs had lovely food and friendly staff. Over all we were very happy!",5,2016,09,12
219,Birthday trip,"Brilliant stay, and the breakfast was amazing. Went for partners birthday and breakfast staff put a candle in a muffin as an extra surprise. Rooms were clean and beds comfy. Couldn't find fault with any part of our stay",5,2016,09,12
219,Lovely stay!!,"The staff were really nice and helpful throughout our stay. We stayed for 3 nights and the room was lovely, clean and tidy. We also had access to the premier lounge on the 7th floor which was also very nice, could help yourself to teas, coffee, snacks throughout the day. Our first night we had dinner in the restaurant, the food was delicious. We had breakfast at the hotel on 2 mornings. The food was nice but the only downside I would say is I don't think is worth ‚Ç¨12.50 extra. Overall a very nice stay and would definitely go back again.  ",4,2016,09,12
219,"Great location, courteous staff, comfy room","After a long flight from Chicago, we arrived at the North Star Hotel. The desk clerks were very helpful, arranging for a slightly early check-in and offering maps and directions to tourist sites nearby. The room was clean and comfortable, and the wifi was solid. Did not try the on-site restaurant, so I can't really speak to that.",4,2016,09,09
219,"Disappointing, overpriced ",Disappointed with hotel - moved from 1st room because of Smelly mildew bathmat Safe not working Fridge not working No water as advertised Moved to room 767 and it's absolutely ridiculous! We have men working 6-10 meet from our window meaning that we have no privacy whatsoever and the noise is unbearable. I appreciate that the hotel cannot control the building work but to charge the rates you do for this room is scandalous. Huge mistake booking here!,1,2016,09,08
219,"Meh, the bed was comfortable","We stayed here for 2 nights. The bed was comfortable. The room was rather small.  The wifi was great the first day, Sunday.  On Monday it was offline more than on.  The front desk tried to tell me it was a problem with my iPhone. When I told him that my partner was having the same problem, he couldn't explain it. Other guests told us they couldn't get it to work reliably either. The shower had poor water pressure, but was hot. Breakfast was good.  I would try a different place if I came back to Dublin. ",3,2016,09,07
219,"A night at North Star Hotel in Dublin, Ireland","Our room was on what they called the first floor.  We went up the stairs and found three doors that you needed to use your hotel key for entry.  Once we got through that, with our luggage and bags we headed down the hall to another door we had to go through, down the hall again and then down some stairs to our room  They did not have a elevator to get you to your room which was not very close, especially when you area carrying luggage, a carry on, a purse and camera bag. Once at the room it was clean and nicely decorated, however, it was near the trains and the trains ran quite often and the room felt like it was shaking, but it was only because the trains were so close and so very loud. There was no place to park at the entrance or anywhere at this hotel to unload your vehicle. This is not a hotel I would stay at again.",2,2016,09,04
219,We left after arriving.,When I booked this hotel through Booking .com it was a 4-5 star hotel  at 275.00 a night . The website says feather pillows and feather duvets. The pictures look great with big windows etc. Looks are deceiving . WE pulled up to the hotel . Not a great area. Right across the street from the main train station.  Walked in front entrance looked really nice. People seemed very nice. After checking in  we proceeded to walk towards the elevator to our room. The carpets were rolling in the hallways. Walls were dirty and old. We to to our room . The paint was pealing off the walls. The walls were dirty. The carpet was filthly . The grout in the tile was falling out. When you walked on the floor under the carpet you could tell the floor underneath was loose . So it made noise when you walked. The window was ver small and the room was dirty. We were in a premier room . The beds were twin  that were on rollers and you could roll it around the  room. There was one small table and 2 chairs that were dirty. The pillows and bedding were old and NOT FEATHER .  I called the front desk and asked for a upgrade. They said I was in a upgrade. Told them on there web site it says Feather pillows and feather duvets. They said they don't have them and it was not on the website. They made a comment that I did the booking from Booking.com. They said the hotel was full and they could not move us . So they said they would send a manager up to talk with us. Shen did not come up I had to go down to the lobby . Since they said they couldn't do anything for us we made other arrangements elsewhere. I told the manager what the problems were she then said that she would get us another room. The room is ok for a hooker for a few hours.  When we left we were told that hotel was a 2 star. And a very bad area. I can see why. I just don't understand where people can give that hotel a 4 or 5 star. It needs a million dollar rents in the rooms. Its disgusting. Would never go back and would not recumbent this hotel to anyone.,1,2016,09,03
219,Short holiday ,"I stayed two nights in the hotel.  I booked through Expedia thinking I included the breakfast which I did not do this was an added extra cost.  The double classic room was very nice and comfortable.  Sade for personal belongings nice ensuite shower over the bath.  Clean and very tidy with hairdryer and tea and coffee facilities no biscuits.  The hotel is by the railway line so the noise of the passing trains can be heard. The gym looked good,  I did not have time to try it out.  Hotel staff very friendly and good room service.  The only real negative is that there is no hotel parking of cars for visitors you must walk 2 - 3 minutes to Connolly train station and it is ‚Ç¨9 per day fee for 24 hours on top of your bill, ‚Ç¨8 euro if you pay by text.  The prices of the evening meal also not included in the booking were high by comparison to other restaurants.  ",4,2016,08,31
219,Weekend in Dublin ,A pleasant hotel quite average for the price.  Location a little further out of the Centre than ideal however an easy 20 minutes walk to Temple Bar area. Room was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was not included in our price but we paid for it extra and found it very nice. ,3,2016,08,31
219,Amazing Staff,"Hotel is on the edge of the City, not a bad thing as it can be a little quieter and it is ogle a short walk in to all the heart. Staff here are amazing, all very polite & helpful, room was well kept and there is air con on floor 7, my only complaint, if it so worthy of a complaint is there was a constant droning noise at a very low level making it hard to get off to sleep at night, Not sure what this noise is, it was like an air conditioning unit buzzing all the time, all over the hotel on the upper floor, asked staff and was told it was ""Gas in the pipes""  mmmm yer! However, I would still stay here chain, but bring ear plugs for sleep time..

Food in the McGettigans Cook House & bar was great, all cooked fresh to order with a good atmosphere. Breakfast was in the basement, difficult to find, but follow the miles of corridors and you'll get there. 
Overall a nice hotel, right opposite the Rail Station with Taxi rank and a short walk in to town. Recommended.",4,2016,08,30
219,Great Hotel,"I stayed here twice with my partner and found it very pleasant both times,
Bar Staff are very nice and attentive at all times! 
Rooms are clean, great selection for breakfast.
Hotel is in a good location and overall a great find! 
We will be back again, 

Cathy and Tommy. ",4,2016,08,29
219,Excellent,Really helpful and friendly staff and the rooms were very clean and spacious. It was a very lovely stay. It is also very close to the central which is a 5 minute walk. Breakfast was also very good. An overall good stay :),5,2016,08,29
219,Good hotel ... need to sort leaks on corridors,Very good hotel with good facilities and breakfast.  Only minor issue was the leaks on the main link corridor between reception and guest rooms.  This was during a very rainy period in Dublin but it doesn't look very 4 star.,4,2016,08,24
219,Long weekend in Dublin,"Stayed at the North Star for 4 days, celebrating an anniversary and it was just what we needed. Room was lovely though we did have a squeaky floor board..would not have like to be the room below. Apart from this everything was amazing. Restaurant attached to the hotel was lovely..good food and service. Reasonably priced too. Hotel is a short bus ride from the airport. Hotel staff were very helpful..nothing was too much bother.
Handy for the main shopping area. Walk round the corner and your on Talbot Road. Which leads into the main part of the city. Where there's everything you could want....shops restaurants, cafes, bars, buses and tours etc.
Will certainly be going back",5,2016,08,23
219,Nice Hotel,"We arrived on a Friday at around 1200 and our rooms were ready for us, a couple we were travelling with were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite which was a lovely welcome surprise. 
Rooms were good, perfectly adequate for what we needed which was a bed to recover in having consumed the odd Guinness!.....
Breakfast was good although as ours wasn't part of the room price, we found it to be expensive at 12.50 Euros, it was all you can eat buffet style with a full Irish breakfast on offer. 
The hotel suffers when it rains, there were several buckets dotted around catching the rain as it seeped through the reception ceiling and the hallway from reception to the rooms was sodden throughout the stay. 
Staff were very helpful and friendly, the checkout time of 1130 was very generous and they allowed us to store our bags for the last day till our flight home. 
The area in general is ok, little bit rough as you are away from the main tourist area, however its about a 15-20 minute walk to the Temple Bar area which is quite easy and we didn't feel threatened walking home late at night. 
We would stay here again and the restaurant attached to the hotel is very very good.",4,2016,08,22
219,** North Star Hotel **,"We arrived late from our flight, there was someone to greet us at the door. Reception wasn't overly bright with too many bulbs. Walking up the stairs to our room we noticed the temperature got a little warmer. Our room was at the back of the hotel, spacious with a king size bed, vanity table, writing area and wardrobe with an iron and board. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as we wanted to try local cafes/bistros. When we checked out at 11am, our flight wasn't until 7pm, so the hotel held our luggage so we could enjoy the city more. Located opposite Connelly Train Station and close to bus station for those not wanting to walk constantly. We got a hop on/off ticket to see the sights. Advise booking to visit Kilmainham Gaol as it gets very full. Trinity College and Dublin Castle are both worth seeing for the history, as is the GPO right on O'Connell Street. The Guiness Storehouse was amazing to visit. There are plenty of bars, cafes, restaurants around for local food and plenty of it! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this fascinating and beautiful city. Can't wait to go back and visit more of it!",4,2016,08,20
219,Fantastic stay,We stayed here the night we arrived in Dublin from USA. Staff was very friendly & knowledgeable. We were dead tired and ordered room service. Food was excellent and fast. Beds were amazing! Not the greatest views of the city but we were happy. Only parking is at the train station though.,5,2016,08,19
219,NOT 4 STAR,"We booked two rooms at this Hotel, Rooms 350 & 351, August 15th for two nights, We were next door to the massive construction work going on at this Hotel, I totally understand that Hotels have work done to them, but not drilling at 7:30 am, COME ON !!!!

The lobby & bar area was very nice & modern, but our rooms were 1980's, Clean but very basic & old fashioned, These rooms worked out @ ¬£146:00 per night with no breakfast.   NOT WORTH THAT AMOUNT...",3,2016,08,19
219,4 star??? Not,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. We had hoped we could do early check in but it was not possible. The hotel is under construction. The first day we arrived, after an overnight flight from the USA, we walked into the resturant next door because the front door was being worked on. I was trying to have a conversation with the main desk but we had to talk in between the jack hammering. Later that day after checking in with very little sleep the night before we were woken up twice by a fire alarm going off due to the construction workers. Then woken up again due to a call from the main desk. We also had a construction worker looking in our window. The rooms air conditioner didn't work so the room was stuffy and hot. They did change our room after 2days. On day four, after a long day tour, we come back to a room that smelt of cigarette smoke. The tub grout and ceiling had spots of mold. They charge for outlet converters. The concierge desk only had someone at it on the first day and was empty from that point forward. The last day at breakfast we found mold on our toast. I do not see how this hotel can be considered a four star.

",3,2016,08,17
219,amazing hotel,"My fiance and I stayed in the hotel for the weekend I August 2016 and I couldn't recommend the hotel enough. We were checked in by the front office manager and she did everything to make sure our stay was perfect, so friendly. All staff in the hotel were amazing and did everything to make sure our stay was as smooth as possible. The hotel itself was beautiful an so clean. The hotel was central to everything that we needed. Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,08,12
219,Great location in Dublin,"The North Star hotel is a lovely hotel in a great location in Dublin. The hotel personnel were helpful and the rooms nice. It's a small city hotel and the room we were in had a view of the street. However, we were not bothered by either the street noise or the trains from the train station across the street. The hotel has a restaurant which serves breakfast as well as dinner and drinks.  However, we did not try the restaurant as there are so many restaurants in walking distance from the hotel. It was convenient to shopping and sightseeing as we could walk or take a bus to wherever we wanted to go. If you are looking for a small hotel, with nice rooms in a great location, the North Star is a place to go.",4,2016,08,10
219,Fine for a Night,Despite a four star rating it's really a three star tourist hotel that is pretty basic. The staff was nice and helpful but the only reason to really stay here is if you need to be close by the Connolly Rail Station or the Bus depot. It's not the best or worst neighborhood but it is walking distance to the city center. The included full Irish breakfast was good.,3,2016,08,08
219,Dublin Weekend,Travelled to Dublin to see Bruce Springsteen in concert. Stayed at the North Star Hotel which was easy to find when we came off of the Airport bus. Nice hotel on a busy road. room had all the usual comforts but looked onto a building site which thankfully wasn't operational at the weekend. Looks like a hotel extension going on - this might be a problem if you want peace and quiet during the week. Breakfast seemed to be served in the basement and was quite unorganised. Looked like they didn't expect such a full house (it was bank holiday weekend). Once we got a table the breakfast was good but due to the wait we gave it a miss for the 2nd day. Didn't eat in the restaurant at night so can't comment on this but the menu looked nice.,4,2016,08,08
219,One night stay at North Star Hotel,"Enjoyed our one night stay st the North Star Hotel, staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was also included and there was lots of variety. Room was very clean and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities.",5,2016,08,08
219,Over priced and disappointing ,"The picture tells the story. We payed nearly ¬£500 for 3 nights which incredibly didn't include any breakfast.
This was the view from our room which is bad enough but when the hammering and grinding metal on top of the train noise started at 8:00am on the Monday morning you can imagine our little trip was a little disappointing.
",2,2016,08,08
219,Excellent customer service and location,"The North Star Hotel is in the perfect location.  Public transit is readily available, but you really can walk everywhere. The hotel itself is quaint. The rooms are clean.  The lobby is rustic and beautiful.  Staff are extremely helpful and polite!",5,2016,08,07
219,Five star does not give it justice best hotel in Ireland,I have never been treated better in any hotel all the staff are pleasant the food is outstanding and I will not be staying any where else in future a big thank you to Ela which made our stay even better,5,2016,08,07
219,Thank heavens for North Star,"Thousands and thousands of years have made Eire what it is today.

Our six week European holiday started off badly when we booked (probably) one of the worst B&Bs in Lower Gardiner Street, Dublin.

Dublin has that je ne sais quoi factor which we loved to bits so we decided to return and booked (online) the North Star Hotel.

We had hired a car from Sixty (brilliant incidentally). I used my previously bought Tomtom GPS. The GPS got us to the bus station..... aaargh... it's really quite difficult to get to the hotel. Parking was a breeze though. Get a ticket from reception... Park the car. Try to remember four days later which level the car is.... retrieve car... find nearest Irish pub to scoff a couple of whiskys to recover.

We paid a tad extra to get a better room which included breakfast.

The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Temple Bar area. It is about the same from most museums.

Being a Scot who lived most of his life in Edinburgh I will never understand the stupid rules which I came across in Ireland. Is this normal?....

The hotel has a pool downstairs which is free to residents... so down I went.

""You HAVE to wear a cap when you swim"" she said.

 ""Cap will cost you five euros"" she said.

Embarrassed with not having a cap I asked if I could just go into the sauna without a cap.

""Yes"" she said; but make sure you don't stay longer than 10 minutes.

I think I stayed for around 6 minutes but got so paranoic in case she was watching me that I probably left three minutes after I had sat down.

The room we had was excellent. ""Money isn't an object"" we said. .. although you do have to go through a couple of security doors to get superiority..

Trump wasn't there but watch out..... North Star Hotel is exactly the type of hotel he would buy then destroy.",5,2016,08,04
219,You get what you pay for ,We looked at a number of hotels in Dublin and chose this one being in the centre the hotel was fine and we were upgraded free to a premier room which was very nice other rooms had a view of a building extension of the hotel no more than 10 feet from there windows ( ours wasn't ) all the staff were very friendly and courteous our breakfast was the normal full English/Irish type and we had one evening meal there again which was very nice my only fault about this hotel was that it wasn't in a nice area and was a bit run down wouldn't like to be out on my own late at night saying that I would use the hotel again as it was handy for most things bus and rail stops ,4,2016,08,03
219,Excellent location and friendly staff,"Stayed here in July, family of four in one room.
Family room quite small, but had everything we needed and was clean.
Hotel not too far from city centre and ideally located opposite train station for days out on the DART.
We used the hotel restaurant in the first night, food was good and the complimentary prosecco appreciated.
Breakfast room in basement gets quite warm, but choice of food was excellent and although it was busy there was no waiting for a table.
Overall an ideal hotel for a family to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,08,02
219,would return,"stayed at this hotel last weekend with 2 friends, had a good size triple room with 3 single beds, air con wasnt working in the room and we let reception know on our way out and they said they would look into it, when we returned at 5 am, there was a note in our room with a box of chocolates, to say they couldnt get the air con fixed.  I thought this was a nice gesture and even though we were all up extremely early the next morning due to the heat in our hotel room, i would return to the hotel to give it another try",4,2016,08,02
219,OK but expected a bit more for the price,"Stayed here 4 nights with the wife for a short break.  The hotel was pretty basic and clean so no issues, although hoped for a bit more given the price.  Paid ¬£115/night.  Staff were great however, the hotel seemed all about the Premier Suites which has its own floors available, and complimentary bars.  Whilst it didn't particularly bother me not having access to this, I feel the rest of the hotel to be more of a 3* than 4*.  Bed was pretty comfortable and air con worked fine.

Location-wise its about a 10-15 minute walk into Dublin.  A little rough area-wise but ok, and plenty of Spars to get your water/croissants in for breakfast.

Used the gym once which again was ok.

Decent enough hotel but sure there are better around for the price.",3,2016,08,02
219,North Star Hotel,"Excellent, friendly and informative greeting. Good value for money. A reasonable walk from city centre. A good base for exploring the city. We only had one meal - breakfast which was excellent. On arrival we were up-graded to a premier room with access to the Premier Lounge. This would be very useful for a meet up location for groups. ",5,2016,08,01
219,Excellent ambience and service,"At every point from - making a special request after booking, having to ring to say that we would be arriving a day late, and in all our contacts with staff we met with helpfulness and positive responses - the staff really seem to enjoy their jobs and this makes the hotel such an enjoyable place to stay. Our room was comfortable with tasteful decor and was well appointed. The hotel is excellently located for Connolly Station (trains did not bother us at all) and within easy walking distance of the city centre and bus transport points. It was perfect for us.",5,2016,07,30
219,Excellent value for money. Not too far from shops,"I was very pleased with this place. Decorated beautifully.  
Room was clean and had the usual hotel extras (soap, tea, coffee)
There was maintenance work being carried out outside so view was scaffolding but we weren't planning on staying indoors for long. 
Only down side was the shower. It was so temperamental, either luke warm or one tiny nudge steaming hot. 
I couldn't really hear outside traffic which was a big plus for such a busy place. It only took around 10-15 mi s to walk to temple bar so not too far out the way. 
Staff were very helpful and polite. Suggesting restaurants and places to see. 
I would love to come back and stay again",4,2016,07,28
219,Hub hotel for a country wide trip,"My family and I stayed at this hotel 4 nights over a 12 day period as part of a country wide tour in July. I truly was torn between 3 or 4 stars but the excellence of the staff makes up for any shortcomings I found with the hotel itself. The hotel is fairly well located in the city without being in a highly congested area. While most of the building is quite old it was clean and all in good working order. A lot of people have mentioned the train noise. While I did hear it occasionally it truly did not bother us at all. Unfortunately we hit a small heat wave on our last 2 days that not only the hotel but most of Ireland was unprepared for. A/C is a luxury rarely needed there. I would recommend booking the high end A/C rooms though if you go in the summer, the rooms can become quite unbearable otherwise if it gets above 75F. So on to the staff - we were well greeted each time we checked in (this hotel was a hub for us that we came back to twice during our trip). Bobby at the front desk was very accommodating with changing one room for us on our last night due to the excessive heat. They will also hold luggage for you in a locked room for several days at no charge if you ask nicely. We used this service as we traveled the country. This service in town is 5 euro per bag per day just for reference. The restaurant on premises is quite good also. Overall the hotel may be a bit old and not the most chic but the excellent staff made staying there worthwhile.",4,2016,07,27
219,Girls weekend away,"Booked a room for 4 for a girls weekend away and couldn't fault the hotel even if we tried. Location was perfect, not far from the shops and close to the temple bar area as well as transport links; staff were consistently friendly; the hotel itself was beautifully decorated and maintained; the room was again beautifully decorated and maintained; the attached restaurant served amazing food and cocktails and wasn't overly expensive. Without a doubt would recommend it and am returning myself in a few months!",5,2016,07,26
219,Good Location,"We stayed in a Premier suite, which was a larger room. It did have AC, which we used as it was hotter then normal in Dublin. The price was better than other hotels that I considered.  We walked to the GPO and to EPIC Ireland from the hotel. It is by Connelly station and close to a LUAS Red line stop, The Wifi reception was good. Had a safe in the room. We had the continental breakfast (juice, coffe/tea, cereal, yogurt, fruit salad, pastries) included but they had to  check each morning as we were on their list at the breakfast room as having to pay and we had to get that corrected all three mornings.  There was a hairdryer, but it wasn't in the bathroom. It was in a drawer near the coffee/tea station (electric water heater, tea, instant coffee (not a coffee maker).  The room was clean. We had a walk in shower and a tub in the bathroom. The soap/shampoo and conditioner were in pump bottles.  The towels were a good thickness and we had wash clothes. There wasn't a clothes line in the bathroom. My nits are that the floor was very creeky, the lighting was somewhat dim, and the lifts had a mind of their own. The lifts are pretty far from reception and we felt like we were walking in a maze to get to them.   There was no ATM in the hotel. The shop next store that had an ATM was closed for renovations when we were there.  The restaurant associated with the hotel was very good. There was some street noise, like street cleaning early,  We were at the end of the corridor so we only heard other room doors closing a few times.",3,2016,07,25
219,Ireland Family Getaway,"My family and I spent a nice 6 days in Ireland, 3 nights at the North Star Hotel. Right when we arrived we were greeted and felt right at home. The room was a bit small and the bathroom definitely needed a little renovation (I think they are in the process of doing that) but overall the hotel atmosphere was great. The restaurant attached to the hotel, McGettigans Cookhouse & Bar, was fantastic. We spent most of the time we had at the hotel there. The staff was very friendly and you can tell how hard they all worked! David who was our server on a few different occasions was wonderful. He really made you smile :). 

Overall great experience for our first time in Dublin, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,25
219,Clean & Modern!,"Hotel is walking distance to the centre (temple bar) within the day but by night it would be a taxi job! Besides that's everything else was perfect, the rooms were a lovely size and the hotel is clean, modern and well kept.",4,2016,07,25
219,great location!,"The room we had was good. the people there are just great. 
It¬¥s just in front of the train station. A lot of shops close by. Also close enough to the city center. It looks old from the outside, but looks great from the inside.",4,2016,07,24
219,"Convenient friendly location, really clean bedrooms","Recently stayed here for a concert and shopping trip and found it fabulous, one minute from Connolly station and taxi rank. Main shopping street (O'Connell st) and abbey theatre three minutes away. Had been thinking of staying near Grafton st but decided location near 3 arena/Bord Gais theatre  and so glad I opted for North Star hotel instead. Found the staff very friendly, from the porter in the lift to the breakfast staff, they were all so helpful and nice. Would definitely stay here again, stayed in a premier room (access to lounge with complimentary snacks/tea/coffee) - our room and bathroom was immaculately clean and fresh with modern decor- an amazing nights sleep and great breakfast with spelt bread, fresh fruit salad, full irish etc We arrived down just a few minutes before breakfast was supposed to finish but we were greeted with a smile. Nothing was too much trouble. Thanks for a relaxing break- I will be back!",5,2016,07,24
219,Visiting relatives,"Have stayed at this hotel a number of times and have been just about satisfied with the standard, cleanliness and price. It's a little over priced and in my opinion does not deserve it's fourth star as it is now. The breakfast is very good however, albeit it's served in the basement with no windows! Sauna and gym, next to the breakfast room, too could do with an upgrade.",3,2016,07,23
219,Spotless,Stayed here on business at ifsc...very good hotel...all areas good considering there is building work going on...rooms spotless....check in very good...food excellent...location second to none...im sure it will be top class when completed..staff are a credit..well done ,5,2016,07,23
219,‚Ç¨150 euros a night...,"My partner and i stayed here for his birthday this week. The hotel reception was modern, we were impressed upon entrance to the hotel. That soon changed when we walked up the squeeky stair case, the heat was unbearable!

We found our room number 210 down the hall, we didnt expect it to be like the sahara desert however. I have never felt warmth like that especially in the middle of july when its 25 degrees outside. We had a measly fan on one side of the bed which was coated in think dust and barely blew anything. So we opened the window.... To discover our room was on a train track! it was unbelievable, we realised that the trains were extremely regular the longer we stayed in the room. It was horrendous, apart from the train track we also had an unbelievable view of a construction site. 

Simply bliss! Due to the heat being such an issue we felt no option but to have the window open (despite the constant train noise). My partner was exceptionally frustrated and thought it would be sensible to request an additional fan from reception..........30 minutes later still no fan! We called again and this time they actually bothered to deliver a 2nd fan. In all honesty the 2nd fan made little difference, so we had to endure the heat and noise. 

The room itself was clean but rather tatty with a massive crack in the wall, and the bathroom door could barely shut properly and if you did manage to shut it, it felt like the whole wall would collapse. 

Apart from the major issues in our room the staff in the restaurant were fantastic and the food was impeckable! 
The rooms need totally gutting out and starting again! Then i feel this hotel would live up to its 4* rating. 
",2,2016,07,23
219,Surprise Birthday Treat,Would definitely stay here again it's amazing. Located right in the centre of everything was so handy for the stuff we wanted to do. Didn't eat in the hotel so couldn't comment. Only thing I will mention we was woken up at 7.00am by the builders working away which was abit early. But will definitely recommend and when returning to Ireland this will be our hotel to stay in. ,5,2016,07,22
219,Good value for money hotel,"I stayed there for 4 nights with a friend. Nice Reception staff, checking-in early (10 am) was not a problem, we were able to have a room straight away. 1st floor with no lift and 2 doors secured by the card to be opened. Spacious and modern room plus a large bathroom,  but no air con and above a very noisy street ( 5 lanes, lots of traffic,in front of the Station) so I couldn't sleep. The morning after, we asked to change the room and they immediately accepted and it was done by noon
: a smaller but newly refurbished modern twin bedroom, on the 5th floor ( with a lift )  with access to the lounge as an upgrade :-) . However the bathroom door couldn't shut nor be locked...And at 7 am we were awakened by an automatic sophisticated system which opened the curtains, switched on all the lights and the television. We don't really need that on vacation... And we struggeld to turn eveything off. We complained to the cleaning lady and the staff at Reception in the morning and that evening -  but it happend again the following morning ! We were told it was brand new and not perfect yet...
Once again, the staff reacted very well and offered free breakfast as compensation.
So overall, despite the little glitches, based on the staff professionalism and reaction, i would certainly recommend this very nice and friendly hotel.",4,2016,07,22
219,just ok,"Firstly if you are coming by bus from the airport this hotel is very handy being very near bus eiras stop.

 The hotel was undergoing refurbishment which did impact on the feel of the place. I had an executive room and overall the room was very nice. 

Things that let the experience down for me was the executive lounge is not well stocked ‚Ä¶only tea or coffee/water with the coffee bit not working. I had hoped that I would be able to use this to grab a quick continental breakfast in the morning but it was totally inadequate so I had to pay to eat n the restaurant which was the usual fare of warmish food under a hot counter. 

The area is quite run down but you are an easy walk into the city.",3,2016,07,22
219,Beautiful hotel & so handy to city centre!,"I stayed in the North Star Hotel with my husband when we were in Dublin for a concert. We were able to check in 2 hours early and the receptionist was pleasant and helpful. Our room was one of the hotel's most basic and it was beautiful. Spotlessly clean, modern, huge comfy bed and plenty of floor space which is rare for Dublin City centre hotels. The bathroom was average sized and possibly the cleanest hotel bathroom I've ever seen. Not so much a one mark on the seal round the bath or tiles. I'm very picky! The complimentary toiletries were lovely too. Our breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the staff were courteous and keen to help. All in all we were extremely impressed by this hotel and will definitely use it again as it's so handy to the centre of Dublin - 5 mins walk to Temple Bar. A great find!",5,2016,07,20
219,Clean but small rooms,"Stayed three days room was small and cramped,air didn't work moved us to another room,very noisey from the remolding.stff was great and very helpful.breakfust was good.had a good bar,good location.hotel would have been better if the remolding was complete.",3,2016,07,20
219,Concert,"Stayed here for the Kodaline concert. No hassle with check in even though it was before check in time. Very efficient staff.  4 of us in a room and enough space, although pretty hot. But for the amount of time we spent there it really didn't bother us!! Breakfast the next morning was amazing. Buffet breakfast and plenty of everything. Shower was powerful, just what you need and towels fluffy. Central to the Luas as-well from Heuston station. Literally a stop right across the road. Would definitely recommend! ",4,2016,07,19
219,A 3 day break in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed in a premier king room for 3 nights. We had access to the sky lounge which was convenient if you fancied a cup of tea or coffee with a few biscuits in a relaxing lounge rather than in your room. There you had a partial view over Dublin as building work was blocking some of the view. This building work was a distraction when in our room as it was quite close and discouraged the use of the balcony. Having said this the room was clean, spacious and comfortable with all the amenities required. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The location of the hotel suited us as we travelled to Dublin by train and was within walking distance to Connolly Street.",5,2016,07,19
219,"Super hotel, would stay again","Great hotel. Not much to critique to be honest, enjoyed my stay a lot! Didn't eat at the hotel so cant speak to the food, hence why i've given only 4 stars. The staff were very helpful and polite. Great location too in the heart of Dublin, very easy to get to the main areas of the city.",4,2016,07,19
219,Great hotel ,"Lovely hotel just a short walk from o connell street and the main shopping areas as well as temple bar. The room was comfortable, the breakfast tasty and the bar was cosy for a drink.  The staff were lovely during our stay especially the very helpful keith! Would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again!",4,2016,07,18
219,"Good relaxed bar, friendly staff",I've been to the bar restaurant in the North Star Hotel. It's a good combination of traditional and modern. Good beer and good food. The staff are really friendly especially Keith who really looked after us.,5,2016,07,18
219,Lovely,The executive room at this hotel was huge and the bed was so so comfy. I thought the hotel was in a great location and had everything that was needed. Such lovely staff members who checked us in and out and made sure we knew where we were going when we were wandering about. Definitely go here again if I'm staying in Dublin as it's so reasonable too. ,5,2016,07,17
219,Good views after we upgraded,"Our original room was located in an area where there was construction right outside the window and the was a heavy smell of cleaning fluid in the room. We asked to change our room and they gave us a free upgrade which included access to the lounge upstairs. That was fantastic to be able to use. Excellent views from both our new room and the lounge. It made our last night in Ireland enjoyable before we had to fly back home the next morning. 

The front desk arranged for a 20-Euro cab ride for us to the airport, however, they must have not communicated with the cab driver as we ended up needing to pay slightly more (around 25 E).

The location was ok. We had stayed in the Temple Bar area earlier which offered a lot more options for shopping, restaurants and the like. The North Star is located in a much more quieter area of the city, where there were more hostels in the area - not actual destination sites.",4,2016,07,17
219,Poor quality,"Stayed here in 2014 and loved it.  Got an upgrade and it was amazing and beautiful.  And then I came back over the space for 2 years maybe 3  or 4 times and it slowly deteriorated. The second time we stayed, the room was fine but they placed us by the rail line which woke us up every morning. Stayed here a third time and the same thing happened again but I maintained it's a lovely hotel to my partner regardless of the poor nights sleep and so we stayed there again. But I regretted it as they put us in an even smaller room with a broken lock on the bathroom door and an overall rundown feel. The hotel is not budget but I feel like we got a budget hotel room. It's a shame because the breakfast is great and the location but they do not reward return service and the high quality rooms are not plentiful. ",2,2016,07,17
219,Clean comfortable stay,"The hotel was very clean and modern. Breakfast was excellent, Staff were all friendly . Hotel is close to the centre but the wrong side for Guinness tour and kilmainham gaol but only a short, cheap bus trip away, Overall after reading some of the reviews on here we were pleasantly surprised! ",5,2016,07,17
219,forget it,"expensive, small rooms, extra charge for all amenities (such as breakfast), poor location (except for connolly station) view is terrible, rooms have poor air control, shower leaks, and so on. Bar lacks the european hosipitality, breakfast very expensive, and no other breakfast (6am-10am) locations within walking distance. I would not recommend.",1,2016,07,16
219,Fab time at The North Star Hotel Dublin,"What a fab place to stay,close to train station and all things you want to do in Dublin,the staff were great on checkin and very helpfull in every way,this is our 5 time staying here and it gets better every time,",5,2016,07,16
219,Outstanding!!,"Excellent hotel! This was our second visit to Dublin, our fist time we stayed at the Ashlings hotel which we found to be a great hotel. This time visiting Dublin we wanted to stay closer to temple bar that is why we chose the North Star hotel. What a choice! We got a great suprise upon arrival as we were  upgraded to premier club where hot drinks and water were free. Our room was spacious very clean with a great view! Staff are extremely helpful and friendly, full Irish breakfast was perfect. We highly recommend this hotel to anybody, We will defiantly be returning to this hotel! ",5,2016,07,16
219,Not worth the money.,"This was by far the worst place we have stayed in Dublin. We chose it because of the proximity to Connolly Station. They were nice enough upon check-in but the stay went downhill from that. Our room,was on the 2nd floor and there was no lift...that is not normally a problem but we had to carry our bags up all the stairs. The hallways smelled quite stale once you passed through the locked door. The room was decorated nicely but it was very hot in there. There was no thermostat or air conditioning. We were provided a small fan but it was not much help. The window only opened a few inches and no airflow came it. Our room faced Connolly Station and the road and pedestrian noise made it even harder to sleep. It was so warm that we ended up sleeping with our heads to the foot of the bed to be by the fan and on top of the covers. This was also the most expensive hotel on our 7 day trip. I am glad we only stayed one night. We booked the room online and met a few others who were staying there who said they had no a/c the first stay either. Would not recommend this hotel. ",2,2016,07,16
219,Pretty good but not great,"Good location for shopping, but long walks for site seeing. Stayed at the North Star Hotel for 3 nights, not continuing but stayed they and then returned after visiting other towns. My first room had a crack down the side of the tub where the water from short could drip. My second room was much nicer, but the door for the shower tended to swing towards the room and away from the tub. I had to take a taxi from the hotel to three airport and woman at the desk said they had a contract and the set fee was 29 to euros, when I got to three airport the driver told me 33.40 euros, almost twice the cost. So my over all feeling is that they try do well, but don't quite make the stay (rooms, information, details) top of the line. This is why I think of them as ok, but not my first choice.",3,2016,07,16
219,Fab,Myself and a group of friends stayed 3 nights and it was fab! The staff were lovely and Sean the receptionist was very welcoming and helpful. The room we were in was really big and clean and was perfect for the time we were in it. Breakfast was also good lots to choose from. Kieran the concierge was really helpful and told us so much about Dublin and what was the best way to travel to different attractions. Would definitely come back again and the location of the hotel was great too.,5,2016,07,15
219,Great Stay,An excellent stay. We had a premium room which was spacious with a very comfy bed and pillows. The shower was excellent and a good Irish breakfast. Only negative is that you need to use your key to access the newer part of the hotel - tricky with luggage,5,2016,07,15
219,Great hotel,"Just stayed at the North Star for the third time. Has been refurbished since my last trip and is really lovely. Staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. Breakfast was great, good choice of food, well cooked and well presented. Two minor cons, firstly the room was at the back and there was a lot of noise from the student accommodation across the road and secondly the soap dish was hanging out the wall in the shower. Having said that I was offered a change of room which I declined and returned later that day to find a hand written apology, a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates in the room. What a nice touch.",5,2016,07,14
219,Great hotel,"We upgraded as the only option for a twin room and was well worth it - lovely spacious room with a great bathroom. Very helpful friendly staff and a good location just a short walk to the river. The 7th floor lounge was very nice but limited drinks and snacks would have been good to have more choice and the coffee machine needed topping up. Food in the resteraunt very good and service excellent
Would stay there again .",4,2016,07,13
219,"great service, could use some renovation","the room and overall maintenance could really use some improvements.  our door didn't close without an extra shove, the beds were a little droopy.  it had all the feeling of an older establishment that needed a new everything.

that said, the thing that made us appreciate the hotel was the exceptional staff.  they really bent over backwards to accommodate.  for example, we were at the concierge desk and concierge was busy, but another staff member came over and answered a bunch of questions, then afterwards when we left, he thought of something else and found us in the gym (he noticed we were in workout clothes and checked to see if we were there to give us another restaurant recommendation).  they printed and delivered our boarding passes for us.

they also have a really inexpensive flat cab service to the airport for 20 euro per taxi.

the connected restaurant was quite good at reasonable prices.

they had a great family room with 3 real beds, not pullouts, at a reasonable price.",4,2016,07,13
219,"Fine staff, but that's all !","Airco not working properly, and if it did, very loudly. WC having flushing issues ... Issues known to the hotel management, but they still rent you the room. They were open to give me another room, but problems basically the same. Find something else if visiting Dublin.",1,2016,07,12
219,Fantastic hotel,"Our 7th stay at this hotel. We have never had a problem with any of the rooms, they are cleaned daily. The staff are very friendly & helpful.  The bar at the hotel is very nice, especially had a lot of banter with barman called Keith. Will be back again & again.",5,2016,07,12
219,Well chuffed :-) ,"Location location....very handy to all the main areas such as O'connell Street,  Henry Street, Temple Bar. We were there for the Beyonc√© concert so it was about a 15-20 min walk to Croke Park which was ideal. 
Room very clean and comfortable,  especially the air con as it was a very humid and warm couple of days.
Staff very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. 
Breakfast was lovely,  only thing was they could with air con in there as it was a sweatbox. 
They were able to hold on to our luggage after checkout which was excellent. 
The bistro belonging to the hotel was superb.  Food was excellent and had the best chocolate brownie dessert I've ever tasted!!  Also the manager of the bistro was fantastic,  very accommodating as we hadn't reserved a table on a busy Saturday evening and she was very welcoming and friendly to us and others we spoke to.
Would definitely recommend to anyone. ",4,2016,07,11
219,Pretty damn good,"Me and my partner stayed on the 8th july as we where going to the beyonce concert on the 9th and when we arrived we where greeted by very friendly staff at reception. We where checkes in and given our keys etc and when we got into the room we where very pleased.. It was clean, tidy and very reasonable for the price especially for its location. The breakfast the next morning was fantastic and I would most likely stay here again.",5,2016,07,11
219,I'm being generous,"Very disappointed with our room, especially for the price. The floor creeks and bends in places when I move around.  The bed is soft and not for some with back issues. The club room offers water and nothing else. We definitely over paid for this room (about $200 a night) and will be moving tomorrow to some place more comfortable. ",3,2016,07,10
219,Rooms all noisey*train over building,People are extremely nice and restaurant is excellent but the noise is horrible as well as poor bedding and rock hard pillows. In between a main street and a single busy street as whell as lower class apartments mad for a horrible experience. In a central location but pick a different hotel. This is more like a hotel 6 on steroids.,2,2016,07,09
219,"Nice people, poor amenities","I was given an ""upgraded"" room, but there were multiple problems in the room.  First, the toilet and shower did not drain well.  I was standing in water during my shower.  Also the plumbing fixtures were loose at the sink.  There were multiple fire drills while I was trying to nap.  Also the cleaning ladies were noisy cleaning rooms before 9 am across the hall multiple days.",3,2016,07,07
219,Well located,I didnt think I would get this close to the city center and be able to park. the staff is friendly but they did tell us and some Germans we were drinking with to go back to our rooms haha. Probably not the best place if your there to party.,4,2016,07,06
219,Bad Timing for a Stay & Trouble Getting Back to Airport,"Unfortunately the hotel was remodeling during our stay and there was additional construction outside our window.  This meant dodging work crews and a view of scaffolding.  The renovations will hopefully do a service to this place, as it is in need of updates.  It has that look of a place that once had some grandness, but is a little past its prime.  The bar attached to the hotel was a little over-priced, but comfortable.  The full Irish breakfast was quite decent and a lot more food than you'd get elsewhere in Dublin for the price, so I don't think it was over-priced at all.
PROS:  Right by Connolly Station & a bus stop, so if you are taking public transportation, it is just a short walk.  The staff was generally helpful & friendly.  A restaurant & bar are attached.  CONS:  Very strange bathroom with a door that kept getting stuck & locking us in (had to be opened from the outside).  Way more walking through long hallways to get around inside the hotel than you'd expect.  Pretty cramped room.  For us, the con was also the construction that was underway, but that just happens sometimes.  OVERALL:  I wouldn't recommend it based on our stay, but I wouldn't warn people away either.  ADDITIONAL NOTE:  Part of our choice of this hotel was the proximity to public transportation.  The bus system was terrible during our stay, with frequently late buses.  If you are staying a short time in Dublin without a car, do yourself a favor & stay in the city centre instead.",3,2016,07,05
219,stayed july 2016,"I stayed here for my birthday, as per hotel staff were excellent and beds comfy as ever only let down was the view from our room as we looked on to a building site from our balcony and had work men working right outside the room which limited our privacy. 
However as always great hotel, great people and im sure once the full renovation is complete it will be 5* not 4*.",5,2016,07,05
219,Don't plan on sleeping in,"The hotel itself was ok. Unfortunately, staff found it unnecessary to inform us that construction would begin at 8am. Right outside our room, and fumes from the generator and machinery would engulf our room. The noise and smell was bad enough for us to just leave the hotel early. And of course, this was our one ""sleep in"" day, as we booked a later flight to be able to rest up. We are a party of 10, involving three rooms all right next to the construction. 
Thanks for keeping the morning construction a surprise for us! But, seriously you should inform your guests of this. Very unprofessional! I've included the view from our room.  ",1,2016,07,04
219,Very nice hotel (small apartment in Ireland really). Great restaurant on premises.,"Very nice to have two separate bedrooms at a 3 guest rate. Had a washer/dryer in kitchen area which, although very slow, came in handy!
We enjoyed the restaurant/bar area very much. Staff very attentive, nice varieties of choices.
Nice breakfast served in lower level- extra fee for ""hot"" breakfast.
Staff helped us take care of a car rental issue and also was very helpful with directions to use our freedom pass-bus service.
Staff went above and beyond!",4,2016,07,03
219,Great hotel,"Stayed here in novemeber and had a lovely weekend away. The hotel was spotless and very peaceful, not noisy at all as i had a read in some of the previous reviews. The food in the resturant downstairs is definately not to be missed! We got a free continental breakfast every morning which was basic but just what we needed in the morning. Overall was a lovely stay and would stay here again.",4,2016,06,30
219,Take a trip to the Fair City,"Had a three night stay at the North Star, the welcome was as good as you would expect a Dublin one to be. It doesn't look like much outside but don't let this fool you. It is perfectly located near Connolly station for easy connections in and around the city.

Our room was huge and it was clean. Being a city girl the hustle and bustle you can hear didn't bother me, but it is worth approaching cautiously if this would irritate you. The only let down in the room was the fact that there was no air con. This is a feature of the older section of the hotel that we were staying in. A room fan only just sufficed, it wasn't too hot in Dublin last week (mercifully) but we did swelter a touch on some of the evenings.

The only small complaint I would level at the hotel is the fact that the breakfast is not included in the price, for 12.50 for a full Irish it does seem a bit steep. That is why you fill your boots when you do eat it (it's a buffet set up). Breakfast time was busy and there were some queing issues to get in, lets just say some of our European cousins are not as au fait with the art of queing as the Brits/Irish are.

Cracking hotel overall, the staff were great and always helpful and friendly.",4,2016,06,29
219,Great stay!,"The hotel is really modern, and super swanky.  Our room was comfortable, clean, and really nice - gorgeous bathroom with glass shower!  We enjoyed the restaurant and the bar too.  It was also convenient location (not far!) to drive to the airport - we stayed just one night before flying home.  We would return.",4,2016,06,29
219,Perfect start to our trip,"We arrived in Dublin earlier today to begin a weeklong tour of Ireland. We couldn't have asked for a better start. The hotel is centrally located and has a wonderfully striking lobby, modeled after an old train station. The lighting is moody and McGettigans bar is just off to the left (the food and service there is great as well). Very cool first impression. Sean, who checked us in (a couple hours early), was friendly and helpful. Due to the fact that we were celebrating my husbands birthday and our anniversary, we were given a complimentary upgrade to a premier king room that was sizable and well appointed. The hallways are a little maze-like, but one time is enough to find and remember where you're going. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was heavenly. Although there was some construction and scaffolding outside our window (we stayed on the 5th floor), we are not ones to be bothered by that sort of thing. The 7th floor premier lounge is beautiful and had complimentary tea, water, coffee, and snacks. A free breakfast is also included with our room. We couldn't have asked for a nicer reception to Ireland and look forward to staying here again on the last night of our trip. ",5,2016,06,28
219,Hen weekend,"I would definitely visit this hotel again. The rooms were very comfortable, food was excellent, though disappointed that breakfast wasn't in with the price of the room, as these were quite expensive. Even though the hotel was on a noisy road and full, the hotel wasn't noisy and I slept really well. 
The hotel's location was on the outskirts of the city centre, but still within walking distance.
Air con wasn't working ‚òπÔ∏è",5,2016,06,28
219,Hotel Hospitality,"We arrived to find that Travel Republic had not booked our room. Maria Bumbu and the staff at the hotel were excellent in organising alternative accommodation for us which was an upgraded hotel plus free transport. When we returned the next day we were treated so well. The friendly staff could not do enough to make us feel so welcome which included a room upgrade, Premier lounge, printing our return tickets and free breakfast. I would not hesitate to return to this Hotel. Our thanks to the excellent Maria.",5,2016,06,28
219,Great for a weekend break in Dublin,"I stayed at the North Star Hotel for two nights [Saturday and Sunday] with my friend in June 2016. It was our first visit to Dublin and noticed most hotels are expensive. We paid ¬£150 per room per night. 

On arrival we dropped off our bags and returned in the afternoon to collect our keys. We were upgraded to a premier room which had a balcony. The balcony was a sun catch so it would be good if the hotel supplied a couple of outdoor chairs to enjoy the weather. We had a spacious twin room with a fridge, tv and comfortable beds. The shower was disappointing because it lacked power.

The staff were polite and attentive. They remembered our names when we visited the desk and were happy to help with directions. The buffet breakfast was really good. I had a full English breakfast both mornings. There were also cereals, fruit, pastries and pancakes. Some of the bowls holding food were lined with bread which probably wouldn't be good for anyone with coeliac disease. 

We ate in hotel's restaurant. My pizza was quite bland and nothing to write home about. But the cocktails were nice. The ambiance was sophisticated yet relaxed. Ideal for a girly weekend away.

The hotel is located close to the bus stop where the airport bus drops you off. To return you need to get the bus from the large bus station about 10 minutes' walk from the hotel.

We found the local area to be a bit seedy in the evenings and were approached by unsavoury characters on several occasions. I wouldn't advise walking around on your own at night time. There is concierge on the door so you will feel at home once indoors. 

I would recommend this hotel if you are happy to walk 20 minutes into the centre. Otherwise shop around, but you may struggle to find a better quality hotel at this price.",4,2016,06,28
219,"Great location , nice hotel with friendly staff","Beside the bus & train station so easy to get to, not far from the centre of Dublin. We stayed here for weekend away with several generations and we all found it suitable. The rooms are lovely & very comfy. The restaurant was great & over all i couldn't complain.",4,2016,06,27
219,Old rooms and undesirable neighborhood,"Was not happy with accommodations. The pictures on the website look nothing like what we stayed in.  We are a family of five and stayed in a ""family room"", 2 double beds and 1 single bed. The room was extremely outdated with tired looking curtains and bed linens. The carpeting was extremely old and disgusting. Ours had red stains on it which looked like dried blood. The bathroom was very old, no new renovations as described in the description. The tile floor was very dirty and their was mildew on the ceiling. The shower/ tub had a half glass door that folded but would not stay shut when taking a shower. Very frustrating.  The walls seemed to be paper thin as we were constantly woken throughout the night by other guests walking down the hall or talking in the rooms next door. Also, the street noise was extremely loud. Although we always had the windows closed, it sounded like they were open.  The neighborhood was very sketchy. My husband was threatened by a very drunk man while he was waiting outside for my kids and I in one of the convenience stores next to the hotel. Honestly, we have never seen so many drunk people during the day walking the streets.  Everything we wanted to do and see we ended up taking cabs across town for. 
One positive is the restaurant/ bar had a nice atmosphere and we did enjoy a nice meal there one of the nights.",2,2016,06,26
219,Very disappointed ,"After all the hype was expecting a large restaurant that was buzzing - place is tiny.
While service was good - it's only ok.
Best of all - when leaving to go back to reception - had a stern blond female manager locking the door - she made no attempt to move aside, and was quite put out when I politely asked if I could get past !!!!!
And what was she doing ????? Berating some poor young chap in front of the whole room.
Sums up my experience perfectly ",1,2016,06,26
219,Short stay in Dublin,"The hotel is conveniently located near train station and bus station near the IFSC, but the immediate area is not very attractive with only fast food joints and conveniences stores. The hotel description said renovated in 2013, well they forgot to do the family rooms... Some parts of the hotel were very nice and obviously recently updated, but not the gym either however. The staff were very helpful. Overall, for us I found that the room was relatively poor value, there idea of a family room is a regular sized room with two extra single beds. This makes for very cramped quarters. Not the best stay we've had in Dublin.",2,2016,06,25
219,Short break to Ireland ,"Really enjoyed our first visit to Ireland. After reading previous comments on trip advisor about this hotel I was a little perturbed. We were given a room on the front of the building and realised this could be noisy so we upgraded to a premium room at the back of the building . Building was taking place there too but it didn't interfere with our stay. All the staff were very friendly and excellent at their job. The food was excellent both breakfast and evening meals in the restaurant.  There was no point in looking for somewhere else to eat , the menu and evening specials were really good. ",4,2016,06,24
219,"Clean, comfortable, with technical problems.","Pleasant staff. Generally accurate. I had a problem with the TV. Found out that the on/off didn't turn it on. They used a generic controller and it activated the screen by entering a channel selection. The elevators are bizarre. If you are going down and someone pushes a button on a higher floor, you will reverse direction and go up again. We had that happen three times on on trip. 
Breakfasts are basic Irish buffet, filling and adequate. It was the same each day for the week we were there. Good coffee and plenty of it.
Dining room was good. One meal with fresh sea bass was very good.",3,2016,06,23
219,Pleasant city hotel with good rooms but a little dated,"I stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights as part of a business trip. The hotel is very central and about 50 metres from the main train station to Northern Ireland. The room was large, clean and with a comfortable bed. Wifi was also good and free and water was provided. I was in an older style room at the front of the building and while it was reasonably well kept the hotel itself is looking a little dated. My room was overlooking Amiens Street and it was a little noisy from the road outside but the more exciting thing is the railway that runs at the back of the property when it passes even the water in the bottles vibrates! To be fair the on site restaurant/bar was very good and it is worth going to it even if you are not staying in the hotel. I ate there both nights and there was a good selection of food and beers. Overall, a reasonable hotel in a great location with a very good restaurant.",4,2016,06,21
219,just class    staff excellent,I think this is a special place the food is simply the best and if you want a good breakfast this is the place with first class ingredients including the pastries all made on the premises very reasonably priced for what you receive here a Dublin must. I hope they expand into a large chain.,5,2016,06,21
219,Location location .. Bruce could have stopped here!,"Had a fab stay in the North Star while over for The Bruce experience... Couldn't have picked better, 10 mins from Croke park and fully fed with amazing food, kept us going for whole gig!! Staff were great, Keith total legend... Had all the best tips for getting around. Looking forward to next stay! 

See ya again real soon! 

Niamh",5,2016,06,21
219,brillant for lunch,Went here for lunch recently and had a lovely time our wiater was really nice guy called keith he was so friendly and could'nt do enough for us .Food was great i had special of the day it was really fresh and tasty,5,2016,06,21
219,"Nice hotel, not so nice part of town","Stayed 1 night on business, normally I stay south of the river but had early morning meeting on the northern outskirts so stayed here. The thing that struck me about this hotel was the nature of service. Even for Dublin this was really friendly and made you feel welcome from the front desk through to the bar staff and manager.  Well done guys!

Room 662 was good but I have a major gripe about the bathroom. It was so dim. There were no lights near the shower (could not read what was in the little jars...) and the shaving mirror had no light either. As I have bad eyes I found this quite difficult. 

Also took about 3 minutes for the hot water to come through, long enough for you to start a cold shower...

Location, not the nicest part of Dublin.",3,2016,06,20
219,"Good service and location, strange layout tho","The staff is very friendly and efficient. The pub on site has terrific cocktails and the bartenders are so nice. Very quick service in the pub. While the hotel lobby is quite clean, the strange winding alway to the elevators lacked air ventilation, had a strange odor and had a bit of dirt and bits of trash on the floor. The breakfast room is in the basement and has no air circulation. We had to endure no air and burning toast. Had to leave just to breath. The room was compatible and had comfortable beds. The bathroom was very cramped and there was no shower curtain so the floor got flooded with each shower, making it very slippery. Gave this hotel an average rating because of the pros/cons averaging out. The location, pub and service make this property good.",3,2016,06,18
219,Great location but rooms need upgrading,"The location of the North Star is great, just a 10 minute walk from O'Connell Street, and upon arrival the staff were friendly. We were allocated a room on the second floor which I assume has not undergone renovations yet and was not accessible to by lift. The room was a good size and clean however the furnishings were worn and the floor uneven. The biggest problem we experienced was the room temperature. The room was always uncomfortably hot despite the radiator being switched off, using 2 fans and having the window open. There seemed to be no ventilation or temperature control in the room and when we came to reception with the problem the staff were only able to offer us more fans. The North Star served its purpose for a short 2 night stay but I would recommend upgrading to a renovated room or staying elsewhere.",3,2016,06,17
219,Was pleasantly surprised !,"We were amazed at how centrally located this hotel was. It was within walking distance to great shopping and eating.  The rooms were very nice. The views were what you'd expect being in the city center. The concierge was awesome, giving tips on places to eat that the locals would go to. All recommended restaurants were spot on, and the hotel bar and grill were great as well. The hotel was across the street  from the train station which we used on our way back from Howth. Everyone was courteous and helpful. We even got a glimpse of how the restaurant loads the kegs of Guinness into the basement. Super place!",5,2016,06,15
219,Great hotel and helpful staff,"We stayed here for five nights. Room was clean and size was ok. The only negative things in the room were loose floor tiles in the bathroom and some broken lights in the ceiling. Also the air conditioning was working weirdly and the temp meter showed that it was 25-27c in the room, when it actually was about 18-19c. That's why the air conditioning was blowing cold air all the time...

The staff was polite and helpful. We were able to leave our luggage to the hotel when we arrived early and after our check-out.

I would recommend this hotel to other couples! The bus station and railway station are near!!",4,2016,06,15
219,Fine hotel was under rennovations,"We found the hotel adequate.  no complaints, but nothing special.  the hotel was under rennovations, which caused unpleasant smell in some of the corridors. the Concierge was patient and knowledgeable. The hotel restaurant is above average.",4,2016,06,14
219,Pretty nice hotel with terrible breakfast service and,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the North Star hotel in early June. The front desk staff was very, very helpful upon check-in -- we got there around 7 AM, far before our check-in time, and the staff found us an available room and we were able to sleep for a few hours after our red-eye flight. The room was nicely decorated and clean. These were the pros of the trip -- a great first impression and a visually appealing room. However, there were two very major negatives. First, my boyfriend and I both have coeliac disease, which requires us to eat gluten free and is essentially an allergy (for example, we can't eat something that has touched gluten). We emailed the hotel about this months ago and were told it was no problem and just to mention it at check-in. We mentioned it at check-in and were reassured that this was no problem and that they had a ""gluten free table"" at breakfast with cereal, bread, etc. Great! However, when we went to breakfast the next morning and asked for this table, the woman running the breakfast had NO CLUE what we were talking about and said they had no such thing. She said they had bread and that a few things on the buffet were gluten free -- eggs, bacon, tomatoes, etc. We asked about cross-contamination and she assured us the food was all prepared separately, with the chef cleaning his pan after each thing he cooked. Yet when we went to observe the buffet, we saw that every item on the buffet except the scrambled eggs was served ON BREAD -- they were all in ceramic pans lined with white bread! This was weird, but what was so, so much worse was that the woman had assured us that it was safe to eat-- we aren't sure whether she was lying (clearly her explanation of cross contamination was just untrue) or she just had no idea and was trying to make it sound safe. Either way, it was a really terrible way to begin the day and we weren't able to eat anything except gluten free bread and yogurt. 

The other downside to the trip was that our room was blazing hot, much warmer than outside and even much warmer than other parts of the hotel. Our room was behind a swinging door, and when you opened the door, you could feel the temperature spike by about 10-15 degrees F. It made it very difficult to sleep and the one small fan in the room did very little to help. I understand that most hotels in Ireland do not have AC, but the fact that the rest of the hotel was so much cooler was a little off-putting.",2,2016,06,13
219,Lovely rooms and staff,Would recommend this hotel as the rooms were lovely and clean.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. The location was brilliant as not too far away from O'Connell st but far enough not to be noisy.,5,2016,06,12
219,Concert trip,"Staff lovely and friendly. Hotel clean and welcoming. Check in was quick. No residents bar, this was disappointing. The bedrooms were clean and really nicely decorated. Air conditioning meant that we were comfortable while we slept. Beds were very comfy.... bathroom was clean and provided courtesy shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. ",5,2016,06,12
219,Gem in the city,"Great little gem on Dublins North side, great location for events and plenty of public transport outside. Lovely decor, friendly staff and food is great too!!! Would highly recommend, lovely for a bite to eat to!!",5,2016,06,10
219,Hidden gem,"I was over for the football after a week at The Spencer Hotel for work. Due to the Friday night being busy with football and Bruce Springsteen, hotel prices were astronomical. I didn't want to spend the ‚Ç¨287 in The Spencer so looked for something else. Found the North Star which is situated right outside Connolly and next to the IFSC. It is being done up and looks really nice. I got an upgrade to an exec room which was spacious and clean. Staff were very welcoming too. On my next visit home for the football I won't hesitate to stay here again.",4,2016,06,09
219,Nice for a city break,"Friendly staff and a nice reception area. The hotel itself is built under a railway so the odd train passes over the reception area every 10 minutes or so which is a bit noisy. We stayed in a triple room, the rooms are a decent size but the bathrooms are a bit dated, the glasses in our room still had toothpaste in them from the previous guest! The hotel restaurant serves nice food, and the bar staff were very helpful. Good location, it's about a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar. Not luxurious but does the job. ",3,2016,06,07
219,The North Star Hotel Shines Brightly,"The North Star Hotel is lovely.  It is, however, not a large, bustling Hilton-type American hotel, but a charming Irish hotel.  It is located within walking distance of the city's center.

Part of the Reception area is quite modern, offering comfortable seating while you read the newspaper or chat with your friends.  The section where you check in has been formed from an old, brick railroad tunnel--utterly unique.  The entire area is decorated with art made from metal or machine parts.  It is striking.

Our room was quite nice.  The bed was comfortable.  The TV was large.  The bathroom offered a shower and tub with glass doors.  The towels and amenities were exactly what you hoped for.  Luxurious robes were also available.  The ceiling-to-floor windows let in all the sunlight you would want until night set in at ten o'clock.

The dining room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was delicious.  It featured eggs, bacon, ham,massage, breads and rolls of every description, oatmeal and dry cereals, fruits, juices, etc.  The American coffee was delicious.

The hotel staff was polite, helpful, and effective.  I would gladly return to the North Star Hotel.",4,2016,06,06
219,Brilliant!,Very pleased with the hotel - even though the it was being refurbished. The staff were very friendly and hotel was superb! Can't wait to return very soon - excellent location and loved every minute!!!! ,5,2016,06,06
219,"Average at best, not 4 star ","Nice reception area as you enter the hotel. Room and bathroom were a good size and bed is comfortable but this is certainly not a 4 star hotel...I've never stayed in a 4 star hotel that has a desk fan in the room instead of air conditioning, and it meant we woke up in the night boiling hot and unable to cool down. Room also had a musty smell and looked in need of some updating...perhaps some of the money spent on the flashy reception could have been used on the rooms. 

Location isn't too bad but it is a little out of the centre and takes 15-20 mins to reach Temple Bar area. I fully realise Dublin isn't a cheap city but still, for 150 euros a night I'd expect a little better.",3,2016,06,06
219,Nice hotel,"Friendly staff, great size room and very clean and tidy. Food in the restaurant was really nice with friendly bar staff. The only problem was that you have to have a credit card for pre authorisation, and not everyone has a credit card. Not much noise at night even though we were right next to the railway track and a busy street.",4,2016,06,04
219,Amazing ,"Stayed over at the North Star Hotel in Dublin for the weekend. I can honestly say North Star Hotel is best hotel I've stayed in. The room was really nice, couldn't fault it. Didn't even need to upgrade the room. Bed is really comfy and great tv as well as free wifi. The hotel is in a great location to the hop on/off buses as well as Croke Park stadium which is highly recommend. Its about a ten minute walk. We didn't book for breakfast when we booked our stay but we booked it when we got there. The breakfast was a buffet which was really good. Enjoyed it that much we booked it again the following morning. The breakfast filled us till tea time which was great. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to stay in Dublin for the weekend. I would go again! Pack a lot of clothes as it could be really nice for about ten minutes and rain the next!! ",5,2016,06,02
219,Adequate but noisy room!,"We stayed here 3 nights.  Our room was on Floor One. Our room and bath were spacious and clean.  However, extremely noisy traffic sound early in the morning (5 - 7 am)!  Plus train rumbles by and room actually vibrates.  We asked about the train noise when we checked in because you could really hear it in the lobby.  We were told we could not hear it in the room which was not an accurate description. Additionally, we booked our room through hotels.com.  Original posting indicated breakfast was included in our rate.  We discovered that breakfast was NOT included and was an extra charge (12 Euros each, I think).  On check in, the pleasant staff attempted to upsell our room to a king size bed (20 or 30 euros per night) which we declined.  Another couple we traveled with did choose to upgrade and it included access to a small lounge which had complimentary basic continental breakfast items. In our 3 week holiday travel throughout Iceland, Scotland and Ireland, the North Star Hotel was our most disappointing experience.    Would not recommend.",2,2016,06,02
219,A Two Night Stay In Dublin,"We were placed in the this hotel by our tour operator, the overall appearance was very good from reception to our room (No 167) which was very nice, but no view due to building alterations to hotel next door. Whilst there were building alterations taking place they were not imposing as far as noise is concerned, other than the work lights that were left on all night  Wi-Fi very poor if non-existent and getting connected a real pain blamed on alterations. Restaurant and bar McGettigans Cookhouse excellent and service by Deirdre was excellent, warm and friendly. Leanne your restaurant host was also very much on the ball, pleasant and welcoming. Do not forget their special menu. Close to Connelly Station a little far from O‚ÄôConnell Street (Main Hub)  if you have difficulty in walking about a 10 minute walk, but not impossible.",3,2016,06,02
219,Good hotel .... Good location,"Very friendly, helpful staff. Hotel is opposite the railway station, so expect both traffic and rail noise. Rooms are clean and comfortable. 
Hotel is very convenient for most attractions, including some very nice water front bars in the recently renovated dock land area. Most attractions are a 10 minute walk. Very convenient for bus station for air port shuttle bus -‚Ç¨10 return. 
Excellent wifi ..... No charge",4,2016,06,02
219,What a surprise,"We stayed at this hotel and found it charming.  What a change!  A lot of renovations have been done since last year. They were still going on while we were thereb but you would never have known it.  A wall appeared in the hallway one day while we were out, up, plastered and completely painted.  Lovely updated rooms and we were given a key to the premier lounge since we were past guests.",5,2016,06,01
219,Good Basic Hotel in Dublin,"Good location, about 10 minutes from the Hop On Hop Off buses, and plenty of restaurants.  We upgraded our room to get a higher floor (friends traveling with us were on the first floor, and said the trains got noisy about 5 AM, but we heard none of that).  Also, with the upgrade, there is a private lounge and free continental breakfast.  The room was a good size, and was very clean.  The staff was very helpful.",4,2016,05,31
219,Pubgrub and drinks ,"Food was great, burgers lovely, chunky chips perfect. Service was lovely.. little sit down area between bar and smoking area beautifully done with big cushions and lovely decor. Smoking area abysmal but maybe under construction?? Nice spot. Menu looked great for later meals.. want to try the smoked fish board some time!",4,2016,05,31
219,Nice hotel....great location,The hotel was fine.  Room was comfortable.  Right across the street from Connolly train station.  Very convenient for us.  Lot's and lot's of shopping and restaurants around.  Walking to many of the popular sites is not a problem.  We did take a taxi to the Guinness Storehouse.  It was on the other side of town.  We did have a mix up with our room one night but they ended up putting us in a suite for our inconvenience.   Could not have asked for better customer service!!  The restaurant attached to the hotel is great!!!!,4,2016,05,28
219,Springsteen visit,"Just spent a very enjoyable night in the North Star. Staff were all very pleasant and helpful and the rooms were clean and comfortable especially after standing for so long at a brilliant Springsteen concert. 
It's a pity there is no longer parking at the hotel but it's not too far to the station car park. ",4,2016,05,28
219,Classy hotel close to city centre ,Brilliant hotel. The reception area is beautiful and recently refurbished. The rooms were spacious and very well equipped with a powerful hairdryer plenty of plug sockets. Comfortable beds and very friendly staff! About a 20 min walk to temple bar and trinity college. To top it off the buffet breakfast was delicious. ,5,2016,05,25
219,Miserable at first.  Things got better.,"Arrived late at night after being lost in Dublin for hours.  We didn't have proper directions from our booking agent or a phone number on our reservation.  The night crew were very courteous but told us to drop our bags at the front and go park across the street.  We got lost again since one-way streets and road construction confused us.  The parking was for the train station but that wasn't made clear.  Not having a private parking garage seemed the most difficult issue since we ended up walking after midnight down a dark alley to get back to the hotel.  Once in our room a gentleman helped us with a key that wouldn't work, the thermostat that was too hot and the TV we couldn't figure out. In all fairness I think our exhaustion magnified any complaints.  Windows wouldn't open for fresh air. 

Tub was deep and roomy, water was good and hot and there were plenty of towels including small face towels which we never saw in B and B's.  Sadly, after a good night's rest we awoke to construction banging and our view was of a brick wall and scaffolding.  Breakfast was yummy but in a windowless basement.  It was raining and the front desk clerk gave us an umbrella.  That was really nice.  ADVICE...Create a map that directs drivers to the parking lot and advise in advance what the cost will be and provide change if needed. Also warn about any construction.  PLUSES:  Location was excellent.  Right across from the station if needed but we left our car in the lot for the day and walked down to the quay and visited Dublin Castle, Christ's Church and the Viking museum.  Plus had the most amazing curry at SIRI's. We probably wouldn't stay there again but I can see where once you get the lay of the land and if you can get discounts (a second night would have cost us 199 euros) it would be okay for business clients.",3,2016,05,24
219,Poor repection staff attitude and poor Continental Breakfast,"Hi My Wife and I have stayed at the North Star, Amien Street Dublin, before and we are sorry to see that the grand wooden stairs have gone! We checked in on Monday afternoon 16/5/2016, and paid for our room in cash on arrival, but the notification of this was so small and the receipt was noted ‚ÄòNot closed‚Äô. When I asked for it to be noted. i,e ‚ÄòCash paid with thanks‚Äô the reception staff were reluctant to do so and did not even give their initials. The room was ok, but we were disappointed to find that the Continental breakfast lacked boiled eggs and there were no bananas in the fruit section. We will use the North Star again when we are in Ireland again, but only as it is opposite Connonly Station!",3,2016,05,24
219,Sleeping in a train station,I spent two nights last week at the hotel. The room was like sleeping at a train station having the train passing by your bedroom every five minutes. I had to buy ear plugs to be able to sleep. I tried to change but the hotel was full. They did change me the second night but it was even worst because I had the noise not only of the train but of the main road. I am still waiting the visit or call of the hotel manager. At breakfast they do not serve expresos which after a night of bad sleep if was you need. It was like going back to the 80s. I have asked our travel agency to delete this hotel from our lists of hotels in Dubl√≠n.,2,2016,05,23
219,Excellent services,"Very nice experience. If we come back to Dublin sure that we are choosing North Star for our stay.
All the persons ware very kindly. Reception, concierge, cleaning personal all these persons ware OK. Thank you for the most excellent job.",5,2016,05,22
219,Nice Hotel in Dublin,"Very stylish reception area, helpful staff nice clean rooms with attractive decoration, the attached bar restaurant friendly atmosphere, great food, nothing too much trouble.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,05,21
219,Avoid,"I don't like to put down a hotel but unfort this time I think I have to say AVOID.
1 Noisey building works taking place outside room window
2 Train line right outside your window
3 No complimentary room water to drink
4 itchy bedsheets
5 A shower that would only suit a midget with poor water pressure
6 Cracks in wall decor

I could go on but enough said",3,2016,05,20
219,We had a great stay,"We stayed in a family room with our 2 kids, 9 and 11........everything was perfect. Wireless good, TV good, coffee in morning good,bathroom was nice...(I still have not figured out why most bottom of tubs are higher than the floor in Europe :) )......

The Guinness and Stella in the bar is good, and the food in the restaurant was excellent. 

The location was perfect for us.

Use the Hop On Hop Off buses !",5,2016,05,20
219,Where every lift journey is an adventure,"With the hotel reception underneath a railway arch, you know you've got a different experience coming. I stayed on business and had a 6th floor room. The bed was very comfortable, and you even got BBC South news. But the en-suite bathroom was very dark and poorly lit - and no tissues or cotton wool balls provided. All of these essential for a businesswoman (who needs makeup) on the move.

It was the lifts that provided the main experience. Getting into a lift, you never knew whether you would reach your destination floor. The first morning, the lift decided it was going to go up instead of down - twice. We ended up walking down three flights of stairs to the breakfast room.

The restaurant was good, although heavily meat-based, with friendly staff and efficient service. In fact, all staff were friendly - but that's a common experience in Ireland. Breakfast staff seemed very keen to tidy away, even before you'd finished eating from the plate.

It is directly opposite Connolly station, and there is a new, big building being built between the hotel and the station. It's already reached the 5th floor. Crossing the busy road can take some time. For all that, it's not too noisy though.",3,2016,05,20
219,Weekend break in Dublin ,Really enjoyed our star at the hotel . Staff extremely helpful.  Room was beautiful . The food in the restaurant was wonderful . Excellent value for money.Easy access to Temple bar district 10 minute walk .Would stay there again if visiting Dublin ,5,2016,05,19
219,First Class Service & Excellent Location,"This was my third time staying at this hotel and from the minute we arrived the staff were on hand when required, I always ask for a cheeky upgrade and I got one.  The room was fab with a balcony and a view of Croke Park and the Spire.  Will definitely be staying here again.  For those who need it the Wi Fi signal is great also.",5,2016,05,18
219,First class service,"We stayed here for two nights booking two suits and two rooms, both were very nice. Great location. 

One of our group is a song writer and accidentally left his song book containing all his work for the last few years at the hotel, after numerous calls I eventually managed to speak to the concierge Kieran Doherty who went above and beyond all expectations and tracked down the missing book. 
Words cannot express our gratitude to Kieran, please pass on our heartfelt thanks for his professional attitude and tenacity, he is an absolute star and a credit to the hotel. Kieran I salute you sir, God bless you for doing more than your job and ensuring this party have only fond memories of our trip. Kieran for president !!!",5,2016,05,17
219,Excellent Hotel,"Our 7 night stay at the North Star Hotel was totally awesome and we had a balcony!  It was quite nice to leave our balcony door open at night for a fresh breeze.  Our premier room was beautiful and exceptionally clean. The beds, pillows and all bedding were very comfortable and we were able to rest quite well each night.  We are allergic to any type of feathers/down products.  The housekeeping staff made sure prior to our arrival that all feather products were removed.  The rooms were quiet and no sounds from other adjacent rooms or hallway.  The bathroom was very luxurious and the thick towels were very absorbant.  I recommend pre-purchasing the breakfast option.  It was great to be able to peacefully enjoy the spectacular spread and outstanding service.  The breakfast was well run and there were many choices to choose from.  Food was very fresh and tasty.   We very much enjoyed this hotel and would choose it again next time.  It is across the street from the Luas (tram) and the DART which came in very handy.",5,2016,05,16
219,Excellent hotel,"Overall an excellent hotel - bar / reception are very nice / modern. Location is good with only a 10 minute walk into town. Rooms are slightly dated and bathrooms are very dated. The shower has a similar water pressure to that of an intravenous drip.

Would definitely recommend for a weekend break.",4,2016,05,15
219,"Really good position, really nice place...in the city center! ","Me and my friends were here at the begging of May for 3 nights/4 days. 
We were in three and we got a triple room (one double bed and one single). The room was not so big, but in good condition. Facilities in the room for coffee or tea every morning refilled. Unfortunately, the bathroom was not so good as the room standard: the shower was a little bit ""old"" and not so practical and the toilet got problem with the drain.
Really good position for this hotel: easy to get here from/to airport (Airlink bus got stop very close to the hotel), close to the city center (Henry Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar) and in front of Connolly Station, where you can get Dart or any other train. 
Great hospitality when we arrived.
They make up the room every day.
We didn't try the restaurant McGettigans Cookhouse & Bar annex to the hotel, but the atmosphere seemed very nice.
We booked with different website and we didn't get breakfast included. Price for breakfast: Euro 8,50 for continental breakfast or Euro 12 for complete irish breakfast. 
But outside is very easy to get your choice for breakfast and pay less. 
This hotel is really a good choice if you need to visit Dublin/or around Dublin in few days.
",4,2016,05,13
219,Decent hotel in a good location,"We had stayed in the North Star Hotel many years ago and were pleasantly surprised at the renovations that had taken place since our last visit.
We stayed in a lovely room on the ground floor which was part of the new extension.
We were lucky that there was no street noise and the room was quite spacious and very comfortable.
We had breakfast included in the room rate and this was the standard fare, but quite tasty.
I notice that the reviews are quite mixed, but we could not fault this hotel or any of the staff and the location suited us perfectly.",4,2016,05,13
219,Should be better ,"The service was very courteous. Beautiful flower arrangements adorned the reception area. The stairs creak and grown but i hear that in old buildings where the old wood needs to be stabilized and new carpet installed. 

The was a long crack in the ceiling and the shower could have used a good scrubbibg with a tile brush to remove mildew. With no air conditioning or humidity control, there can be those problems.

We left the windows open at night to ventilate since there was no air conditioning and there was alot of loud street noise so take ear plugs.

We had room service as the restaurant will not allow take out. It was well presented and delicious.  I ordered the meal in the restaurant from the full menu for more choices.",3,2016,05,13
219,Decent stay,"The hotel wasn't really bad, but it wasn't great. It was a good sized room, because we had really small rooms in London and Edinburgh, so this was an upgrade. The room was really hot though, we couldn't get the air to come out cold. After you showered, the room was extra hot. The shower, sink and toilet had really bad water pressure though. You had to flush multiple times and stand directly under the shower to get soap off. The shower also would change temperature quite frequently from hot to cold to warm to freezing. Another thing that bothered me was that the tub was really high off the ground, so you felt like you were standing on a step ladder in the shower. It felt hollow underneath the tub as well, which made me hesitant to move around. The staff were helpful and friendly though and the restaurant next door was convenient, but expensive. The hallway from the reception to the elevators also smelled bad and every so often you'd see the staff spraying it with Febreeze. I don't think the area around the hotel was that great either. I may come back if they fix things up, but it wouldn't be my ideal location.",4,2016,05,11
219,Not what I was expecting,"I will start by saying that we stayed here for our last two nights in Ireland.  We were in the country for the 5 days before.  This being my first time visiting Ireland Dublin was an drastic and unanticipated change in scenery, coming from the rolling hills and all.  

With that being said, it was a really disappointing feeling getting to our hotel.  It was on a major road and very noisy.  There was no parking and we had to search the streets to find one only to hope that we were understanding the parking rules correctly.  In the lobby it felt as though it was about 2 steps up from being a hostel.  The staff was friendly enough.  There was no elevator and we had to climb a flight of stairs with all of our luggage.  This was after I asked a staff member where the elevator was and was pointed through a maze of hallways.  Only to find that when I got to the elevator it did not go to the 1st floor because that was a different part of the building.  After making my way back to the lobby a nice employee carried my bag up for me.  Did I mention that there were several doors that I needed to get through that required the key card to open?  If felt extremely secure which made me feel insecure because I wondered what the need for the security was?  Weird i know, but that is how my mind processed it.

Now for the room, we finally made it in and it was really disappointing.  I understand that it is in the city and space is limited however, when I walked in the room it felt small and dark.  The tub was extra small, and I realize that seems to be a common trend in Ireland, but this was extra small, my husband is 5'11"" and had a hard time turning around in the tub without having to take a step out.  The rug was old and dirty, the floors were slanted.  And i really lost it when I sat down on the middle of our king size bed to find myself sitting on a hard corner of what I realized then was two uneven twin size beds pushed together.  We were on the first floor and it felt as though the double decker buses were able to see in through our window.  There was a lot of train and police activity.

Now, the nightlife around here was great, a 10 minute walk from the Temple Bar area, and some of the best fish and chips I have ever eaten, Leo Burdock Fish and Chips.  After that we went into the Old Storehouse for a couple pints of Guinness and some amazing music.  It was a great end to our trip..but then back to our hotel...ugh.",2,2016,05,11
219,poor,"This hotel looks nothing like the pictures on Trip Adviser. It's pretty dark and tired looking.
I have no idea how this is a four star rating. The beds were uncomfortable and quite small in length. the room was very cold and I was not able to adjust the temperature. The area isn't very nice ether. In fact I had a building site right outside my bedroom window about ten feet away ..........",1,2016,05,09
219,Very Accomodating,"As part of our vacation package, the first night in Ireland was at the North Star Hotel.  Through GPS, the hotel was easy to find.  The parking lot was not.  Also, the parking lot needed coins to pay for metered parking.

That said, we were able to register in the morning and sleep some of our day away after our trip from America.  Because the hotel is across from the transportation center, we were able to take a taxi to the shopping area.  We ate at the hotel's restaurant.  The food was delicious!",4,2016,05,09
219,an ok hotel but no carparking,"The hotel was ok! We stayed about 2 years ago & the hotel had a car park. Unfortunately on returning there was no car park, we did not think to ask! They state it says on their web page, I couldn't see it but it may be there & I can't find it! 
We were advised to park across the road at Connelly st car park, ‚Ç¨9 for 24hrs, but it was full so we were directed to a q park, which was a nightmare to get to with roads closed for road works & having never driven in Dublin it was a stressful experience, took ages to walk to hotel (again this could have been our fault as we don't know Dublin we probably took the long way round! )took about 2hrs out of our day! Everything else was grand but I wouldn't stay again as it had no car park ! The lady at reception just said it was beyond their control! Again I understand this !",3,2016,05,09
219,Birthday treat ( not),"Knowing there had been significant investment in this hotel my husband decided to treat me to a stay here for my birthday. As it was a significant birthday he 'upgraded' to Premier'. The room was average (view of a student accommodation block). We were also entitled to used the ' Lounge ' on 7th floor that was a soulless room with a coffee machine and empty fridge ( rotten fruit).
The hotel had a 'swipe card' entry system which was a complete farce.
Unfortunately, this dragged down the predominantly high standard of staff who tried their best to give good service.
There's ongoing investment with the hotel, they are extending to add another 70+ rooms, although whilst we were there we encountered buckets with water dripping in. In our opinion they should improve what they have as at times it appear they can't cope with what they already have!",2,2016,05,09
219,Great location for last night in Ireland,"Great location, very nice, clean and surprisingly quite since we were so near the train station. This was our last night in Ireland and we were very close to the Busarus to catch the airport shuttle to head out the next morning. Plenty of absorbent towels, coffee and such. Slightly small but very understandable for the location. Clean comfy beds. Would definitely stay again.  ",3,2016,05,08
219,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, very next to Conolly Station, not far from city center (10 minutes walk) , not far from historic center (15 minutes walk).
Clean bedroom, bathroom with bath.
It was very expensive on saturday booking",4,2016,05,08
219,Lovely little place! ,"After booking as a birthday surprise for my fianc√© we were very happy to find a box of chocolates and a birthday card awaiting in our room on arrival, such a lovely touch! We paid ‚Ç¨30 Euros for an upgrade, the room was fab on the 7th floor with access to premier lounge which included tea coffee bottle water and cookies! 
A full breakfast charged at ‚Ç¨12.50 was very reasonable and the food was great, lots of choice and all very fresh! Staff great couldn't do enough to help, the only thing was our flight wasn't until the evening and they wants to charge ‚Ç¨10 an hour to keep it safe for us! Pretty steep! But all over great stay and we would return. ",5,2016,05,08
219,"Good Value, Good Location","Great northside location near the Connolly train station and Busarras.  Very close to LUAS Tram on Abby Street.  Excellent value for Dublin, convenient restaurant and bar.  Perhaps 10- to 15 minute walk to Grattan St, Trinity, and Temple Bar. Good value for Dublin.  In fact, all was good.",4,2016,05,07
219,Great place in Dublin,With a tour group we were lucky enough to be booked into the Premier club level. We had a full breakfast on the first morning which was very good. The room itself was clean and comfortable. We checked out the premier club lounge the next morning for croissant and coffee. Really nice. Had dinner at the bar one night...just soup and salad. All good as was the service.,5,2016,05,04
219,Great place to stay in Dublin,This was our first trip to Ireland and while in Dublin we stayed at the North Star for a total of 3 nights.  We had a fabulous stay here.  It's obviously not a new building but some of it is refurbished quite nicely and it appears that other parts are under renovation.  We had 2 room in separate sides of the place and both were clean and quiet.  The restaurant was nice and convenient and the Irish breakfast was fabulous.  I had 2 travelers in their 70s and a 7 year old traveling with me and we all enjoyed our stay.  Staff was tremendously helpful.,5,2016,05,03
219,Lovely stay ,"My partner and I stayed here on a city break to Dublin. It is well located and easy to navigate to, with majority of main attractions within 15mins walking distance. All the staff were both friendly and professional. Sean, in particular, made our stay perfect. The room we were initially given had building works outside and was very noisy, he made sure that we were quickly upgraded to a quieter room, which we were very grateful for. The rooms are all modern and cosy. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to anyone. ",5,2016,05,03
219,Exceptional Service,On 22nd April 2016 checked in to this Hotel for my 55th Birthday a first time stay for me but my daughter Catriona @ her partner @ Daughter had been several times @ sang their praises now I want to Location was perfect left car at home in Gorey @ got the train so had no distance to walk first to greet was reception we were early but made us feel so welcome Bar Person ' waiting staff carried on the excellent @ friendly Service I had some retail theropy to do so left bags n hit the shops several hours later returned to Hotel North Star @ when got to our upgraded Appartment found a Birthday Card @ Chocolates thank ye all so much for making my stay so special I will be back @ highly recommend <3,5,2016,05,03
219,Quality stay,"Stay in hotel on a Thursday night after taking my son to the wrestling in the point,staff were friendly and very helpful, we ate in the bar before we left for the point and the food was excellent. This hotel is well worth a vist and city centre very easy to get to from hotel. We will be back",4,2016,05,02
219,Nice hotel. Good location,Good hotel with comfortable rooms. Great location for getting around Dublin. Our flight got in at 5:30 am and we were traveling with a baby. They were able to get us into our rooms around 11.  Ella at the front desk was incredibly helpful. Thanks.,4,2016,05,02
219,Excellent Service from Hotel Manager,"We arrived from a long, delayed 7 hour flight from the United States. Unfortunately, we arrived at 5AM and checkin was not available until 2PM. We were traveling with an 11 month old and waiting around for 9 hours to check in would have been a huge problem. Fortunately, Ella the hotel manager, was quick to assist despite the check in rules. She was sympathetic to our needs and we truly appreciate her exemplary service for our family.

Overall, Northstar Hotel fit our needs. The location is close to the buses and public transit and also close to the city center. The lobby is very basic and smells like cigarette smoke and the gym has outdated gym equipment. The rooms made up for the flaws. Note- We were given a room in the top floor which was an upgrade with access to the Premier lounge.",4,2016,05,01
219,Good stay ,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for his birthday recently and enjoyed out stay. We were upgraded to a premium club room on the 7th floor (perhaps as I asked for a quiet room) and the room was nice, the hotel gave my boyfriend chocolates and a birthday card too which was lovely!
The only negatives to this hotel are: it is still quiet on the 7th floor so I would refuse a room any lower down. The hotel is also in a rough area
Would probably stay again if the price was right 
Thanks :)",4,2016,04,28
219,very convenient for the bus and metro,Myself and partner have just returned from Dublin and stayed at the North Star hotel for 2 nights. We had stayed a few years ago but it has been refurbished to a good standard and had a really enjoyable stay. We had a meal in the evening and must say it was really nice the service was great and the bar staff and waiters were really friendly. The rooms are clean and modern.  We saw Sean who has worked in the hotel for over 20 years and Pat the consierge again he had been there for a good number of years! Pat was so helpful and had great knowledge of anything we asked him. He advised the best and cheapest way to go to the Guinness Museum and the airport he is a  really likeable guy. We called in at the bar called Clearys which is about 3 doors up from the hotel it's a really old fashioned irish bar n the Guinness is great! It's got a lot of memroblia about the uprising in 1916 and the locals are very friendly if you want to talk to them they are more than happy to join in.  We also went to Temple bar this is so lively and if you don't have a good time then you will never have a good time anywhere there is something for everyone! Goggartys is great with a number of floors and each one has  a different type of music being played.  One thing you will need is a lot of euros because Dublin is not cheap!!! Saying that though I would stay at the hotel again and will definitely go back in Dublin again very soon if possible. ,4,2016,04,27
219,Brilliant stay,"Stayed here with my sister for 3 days and loved it. Was expecting not to be able to check in as we were early however the lady gave us a room straight away! Our room was large with a double bed and 2 singles even thought there was only 2 of us but we weren't complaining! The beds were very comfortable! And the room was nice with a bath with things included such as body wash and hair dryers which were handy. The staff at the hotel were very friendly where every staff member you walk past says hello to you which is nice. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to the shops which was perfect for us. If you go out the hotel then right and keep walking there is the jervis shopping centre which we particularly liked with shops like forever 21, berksha ones which we don't have where we are in England. Also the Connolly laus station is opposite the hotel which is handy which we used to get to the guiness storehouse issuing the 'james' stop. The only downside of the hotel is the noisy building work. Right outside our room window was a building site with builders on it which was very loud drill like noises at some times however this didn't ruin our stay. We did not eat at the hotel restauraunt. Would definitely stay here again if we returned to dublin. ",4,2016,04,27
219,Excellent all round !,"What a great independent hotel , perfectly placed for the airport
Link bus and access to the centre and the temple bar area a short walk or bus ride away.
We didn't eat here but used the bar a couple of times and the food looked and smelt lovely. The staff were fabulous from the bar guys to the reception staff all very helpful friendly and ready to please. Rooms were very well appointed and the bed very comfy. It was my birthday and a nice touch was an upgrade to a premier room and a handwritten birthday card with some chocolates which was very thoughtful ! Would definitely  stay here again highly recommended .",4,2016,04,26
219,"Smelly, dusty place with noise and weird restaurant","If you look at the photos at one of the booking sites, you are going to think it is a nice hotel. I guess they spent more money on photoshop than the real decor. The staircases are creaking, the rooms dark and have an unintelligble smell that makes you wonder if something - or someone - died there recently. 
They claim four stars, I don't know who they paid off to get that, but ask the cab drivers in Dublin and you get a better idea: three different chauffeurs called it flat out a scam, I am in agreement and would recommend finding another hotel.

I booked a standard room and was first directed to a very small, narrow quarters with a small window facing a wall with dumpsters in front. There was one single bed and you could barely get around. When complaining, I was shown a much larger room facing the very busy and noisy street which I accepted... having payed a healthy sum for staying there, I thought the first room was a mistake, but it actually  seemed to me that they just ""tried me out"" if I would accept something lesser than I had payed for.
 
The restaurant is just a bar with food such as fish and chips... I wouldn't recommend this place unless you have absolutely no other choice.",2,2016,04,25
219,"No parking, but delightful hotel","There is a new section and old section to this hotel. We stayed in the old section, so we had to walk up (and then back down lol) to our room. That said, the room was fine, the location was good, the food in the restaurant was good. Overall, would stay there again.",4,2016,04,22
219,Poor WiFi,"The location is perfect, and employees very nice.
But room far too hot, not able to adjust down, and alot of noise from street.

The worst is WiFi access, it's so slow that reading a newspaper is difficult. Forget about doing some work.",2,2016,04,22
219,"Good compromise, well located, friendly and nice staff","Was there for a congress in Dublin, the hotel is well located, walking distance from Convention Centre and city centre (Temple bar). Good price for a good level room (a bit too warm inside). The view from the room (street side) was not so nice (on the backside of the railway station and a building on construction) but it was not too noisy although trains circulating at night. Breakfast and restaurant was fine and not too expensive. Staff was very nice, and gave us good advices for restaurant and nice bars in the city. Ask Daniel to help you if needed. 
Also good hotel for tourism and families.",4,2016,04,21
219,Less than impressed,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel in conjunction with a Groupon travel deal.  We had read the reviews prior to travel and so, arrived in Dublin thinking that everything would be fine.  Sadly, we were very disappointed.  The hotel is in a decent location (seems a tad rough in comparison to other areas of Dublin, but as two women traveling we never felt unsafe) and is within easy walking distance of a lot of what you might want to see while visiting in Dublin.  However, the hotel itself left a lot to be desired.  The room was tiny and extremely loud.  It didn't sound like there was any sort of insulation or soundproofing at all, as we could hear exactly what was happening in the hallways at all times.  We could even hear the people in the room next to us switching their light switch on and off.  Further, from the website it looks like some of the rooms have been renovated, so maybe those rooms are nicer, but we certainly didn't get one of those rooms (not entirely unsurprising given that we were traveling on a Groupon).  The beds were horrible and super uncomfortable.  We nearly switched to another hotel for our last night, but opted not to as everything was already paid in advance and we were leaving so early in the morning for the airport anyway.  

The staff was generally very nice, but they weren't able to give very good recommendations for things to do in the city.  They also seemed to be very unorganized.  

All in all, I was fairly disappointed during my stay (especially after staying at the other hotels we were booked at in other Ireland cities...which were much nicer) and would not recommend this hotel to friends and family traveling to Dublin in the future.",2,2016,04,21
219,North Star hotel,"This hotel is very convenient to train station, bus tour and 10 minutes walk to the needle point which is a landmark at the centre where you can shop to your content. The staff at the hotel are very helpful and indeed enjoyed my stay.  We could not get enough of shopping due to early closure to all shops. Fun at night at pubs where everyone enjoy the Guinness. I tried it and it's yummy. Be aware of the unpredictable weather which has 4 seasons in a day",4,2016,04,20
219,Good Location,"Across the street from Connolly station.  Talbot street around the corner with four block walk to O'Connell street.  Full service hotel with restaurant, gym, room service and a hot tub. Quick and friendly check in. Staff eager to help with your needs.   Rooms have the standard features but are very simple - pine furniture and no decorations on the walls.  Good free wifi.",4,2016,04,18
219,Brilliant hotel - great location ,"We stayed her for 2 nights and booked into the premier room. This meant we could get complimentary coffees, water and biscuits and also had access to the gym and spa.

The rooms very spacious with a decent king sized bed and a tv. The bathroom was a good size with a shower/bath toilet and sink. 

There was a safe in the room that was free to use. 

The hotel itself is located 10 mins from o connell street and the Temple Bar area and is opposite the tram station. ",5,2016,04,17
219,Brilliant,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my husband for my birthday and I must say its a lovely hotel.
The hotel is situated on the edge of town so it's a 10-15 min walk into the centre. We booked the premier room which gave us access to a private lounge where we enjoyed a complimentary continental breakfast and unlimited tea and coffee. 
The hotel itself was nice and clean and staff were both friendly and helpful. We did not try the food in the on site restaurant but heard the food is nice.",5,2016,04,16
219,Definitely not a four star hotel,"My trip was booked last minute so I did not have a lot of options but this hotel seemed nice, the photos looked great. The reality, however, was rather disappointing. 

Aside from the fact that the hotel could do with some renovations to update it, these were my main gripes:

- the room does not look anything like those in the pictures. 
- there is a distinct toilet smell in the lobby, it was there every day of my stay. 
- the wifi is spotty at best, and has required me to log in again and again in roughly 20 minute intervals. 
- there has been some sort of construction taking place at the hotel, and this has spanned outside of traditional office hours and is, as such, disruptive.
- the A/C in the room didn't work well.
- the TV kept losing signal and cutting out. 
- put a 'do not disturb' sign on the door, but our room was disturbed anyway. 
- despite the fact that breakfast appears to be included in their standard rate, we were told we couldn't have breakfast as we had booked through Expedia. 

Alongside these things, the hotel is a bit further away from the centre of the city than it had seemed. 

Personally, if I come to Dublin again I would stay somewhere else.",2,2016,04,16
219,Overall amazing.,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel, would stay again if we ever came back to Dublin.
The room was nice, the evening meal was good (even though it was a bit pricey) and the staff were lovely.
The breakfast was amazing, I personally enjoyed using the pancake machine (I've never seen one in any of the hotels I've stayed in the UK) and I think that's the first time I've enjoyed breakfast in a hotel.
My only complaint was the builders right outside our window, starting their work at 7 in the morning and that the TV didn't have many channels. The builders didn't disturb us, but some people in the rooms next to us said that they'd woken them up. 

As for the inside of the hotel, I thought it was lovely. The reception area plays soft music, which you don't hear too often, and the decor was definitely up-to-standards.

For the location, it's amazing. All you have to do is walk around the corner and you've got the main shopping street with all the different centres on it. You can spend hours there, there's lots to see, especially if you aren't familiar with a lot of shops outside the UK (or where ever you live). There's a Spar right next door, so you can pop down to get a drink and go back into the hotel at any time you like. Besides that, you've got all the taxi's waiting across the road (incredibly helpful for us considering we don't know buses or how to get to the venue/airport any other way) and the train station right outside (which we never used). 

Best of all, the hotel has free wifi. Something I needed, considering my mobile doesn't work outside of the UK.",4,2016,04,15
219,Lovely place,"What a lovely place just across the road from Connolly station. Breakfast was very good all you can eat. Reception was very good, quick and willing to help with anything. Meal in the adjacent restaurant was very good too.While visit Ireland i would definately stay again this would be the first place i would check out. ",5,2016,04,12
219,Perfect for a girlie weekend away,"We recently stayed at the Northstar Hotel for the Bank Holiday Weekend and couldn‚Äôt really fault it. We were away for a girlie weekend and arrived 5hours before check-in and luckily one room was available for us all to check, the receptionist also confirmed that they would ensure that both rooms were on the same floor which was really helpful! We were also upgraded to the premier rooms upon arrival which allowed us access to the ‚ÄòVIP‚Äô lounge on the top floor which provided free bottled water, biscuits, tea, coffee etc 24/7. 
The rooms were clean, contemporary and provided everything you would need for a short break away. The location of the hotel was perfect as it cost us only ‚Ç¨25 from the airport in a private taxi. During our stay everything was also in walking distance ‚Äì but not in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. It was also useful that there almost seemed like a ‚Äòtaxi rank‚Äô across from the hotel which ensured that each night we were able to just walk across the road to grab a taxi. The cost for example to Temple Bar was roughly ‚Ç¨14 ‚Äì easily walkable but not in heels! 
The only negatives I would say that the fire alarm went off twice during our stay ‚Äì once at 5pm on Saturday and roughly at 6.30am on the Sunday Morning. Both false alarms and an inconvenience but it definitely didn‚Äôt ruin our stay. Also, on our floor there was a strong smell of smoke throughout the hallway ‚Äì it was clear the guests in the room adjacent to ours were smoking, which I imagine is hard to control but causes an unpleasant smell every time you leave/enter your room!",4,2016,04,12
219,shining star at the north star,"just back from a wonderful stay at the north star. our room was lovely and the staff could not have been more helpful. we had a problem with a noisy and inconsiderate party in neighbouring rooms, the staff dealt with this very well and Ela the manager in particular was incredibly professional and compassionate and really tried to make our stay as comfortable as possible - she listened and offered to change our room, however, we chose to keep our existing room . the hotel is right next to the connolly train station so very easy to find and a short walk to the main shopping streets etc - hotel is clean, excellent food and outstanding staff - thank you would definitely stay again.",5,2016,04,11
219,"""Unbelievable Scenes""","Went for a one night stay with the lads, on the ale early doors, checked in around mid afternoon by then we was blind but the room was an absolute belter, free wifi came in handy for the Bluetooth speaker session. 

Quick shower hit temple bar got more ales in and it just resulted in absolute unbelievable scenes. By midnight we were absolutely flying then went and got an absolute belter Big Mac job done European away day, unbelievable scenes ",4,2016,04,11
219,Lovely stay,"This was my second stay at the North Star and there was a very good reason I returned. Lovely hotel in a great location. 
We stayed in one of the premium rooms and the decor and facilities were top notch. The bed was incredibly comfortable and our terrace looking out onto the city had a great view.
Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a trip to Dublin. ",5,2016,04,10
219,Great hotel with lovely staff,"We arrived at the hotel at 8am, a long time before check-in but they had a room ready for us and got us checked-in straight away. The receptionist was lovely and recommend some places to go that day. The room was spacious with a big bathroom and very very clean. The breakfast downstairs is the standard Full English for 12.50 euros or continental for 8.50 euros. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk to Temple bar, and a 2 minute walk from where the Airport bus drops you off. I would highly recommend this hotel, great helpful staff and a lovely place to stay!",5,2016,04,10
219,Holiday ,"Stayed for 4 nights in a triple room. The room was clean and well furnished with a hair dryer and shower gel and shampoo provided.  The staff were all friendly and helpful. 
The only issue I had about our stay is we had a triple room but only towels for 2 were left every day. The reception staff brought extra towels up when we asked. 
I think breakfast should have been provided in the price. 
Well located for the dart, train and buses.",4,2016,04,09
219,First Timers to Dublin--Stay Here..,"My new wife and I came here from the United States for a honeymoon in November 2015.

We haven't traveled outside the United States, so travelling overseas was a big step for us. We arrived in Dublin early on a foggy morning. Driving on the left-side of the road was treacherous enough, but due to the weather conditions, it seemed that the odds were stacked against us. We felt a bit lost, disjointed, confused, and as many would say, ""strangers in a strange land"".

After navigating the roads of Dublin, the first bit of relief and comfort we felt was when the manager of the North Star in Dublin came down to greet us after a long night of plane and car travel. 

""Hello, so you must be our American friends? Let me help you...""

I wish I could remember his name...I can only say that he was welcoming and excellent in understanding our situation. It's hard to describe, but he was one of the first people in this new land that was ""on our side"", so to speak. We met many more wonderful Irish people that made us feel even more at home. However, the hotel manager was motivated to listen to our tourist-related concerns and make us feel comfort.

After the manager helped us get situated, rested, and oriented, we had an amazing stay in Dublin. We spent a lot of time walking around the city...viewing historical sites, having a good time at the local pubs, and learning about Ireland's history.

The manager of the North Star hotel in Ireland shaped our trip. As a couple of Americans in a new land, he made us feel welcome. He made us feel confident in exploring many corners of the wonderful Irish culture. My wife and I are currently planning a follow-up trip to this same hotel.

Although, we've learned that it's probably best to use public transit..not to rent a car. If you want an authentic experience in the heart of Dublin, this is the place to stay.",5,2016,04,08
219,Older hotel in the city center,"This is an older hotel with two specific sections.  The older section is quite modest.  It has no elevator and narrow stairwells; the staff is very willing to half with your luggage however.  Stay in the newer section, the rooms starting above X50 (150, 250, 350, etc.) the rooms from X01 to X15 are in the older section.  The hotel is very warm at night but it is on a Main Street so you have lots of traffic noise all night if you open a window.  Our room was right next to a bright street lamp so for someone who prefers a cool, dark room to sleep in, it was not a pleasant experience.  The breakfast was not included in our room price so we paid extra for it.  It was 8 euro for the continental breakfast and 12 euro for the Irish breakfast.  The variety was limited, the coffee was warm and the ""hot food"" was barely warm.  All-in-all not worth it.  There is a small market around the corner has muffins, fresh fruit and hot coffee if you are willing to venture out.

I view the hotel as a transition hotel to stay while you are passing through for a night but no more.  It is a cross the street from one of the bus stations if you are lucky enough to be there when they are not on strike.",2,2016,04,06
219,Dissapointing meal,"Called in on Sunday as we had a couple of hours to spare before our train to Belfast and fancied a bite to eat.
It was 1215 and we asked a member of staff when were they serving lunch and they said ""now"".
Had a quick look at the menu and decided to order the roast lamb, mashed and roast potatoes and veg.
The two small slices of lamb were tough and inedible, the roast potatoes were hard and the ""veg"" (four pieces of carrot)were beyond al dente.
Left most of the meal and after telling a member of staff why we had left our food we were offered a cup of tea or coffee ""with our complements""
Everything on the plate could have done with 30 minutes additional cooking.
This was a meal that 99% of home cooks would have prepared in a far superior manner than these ""chefs""
14.50 euro !!!
We won't be back",2,2016,04,05
219,Great hotel,"Stayed here the beginning of April 2016 and really enjoyed my stay!
The hotel upgraded our room free of charge on arrival which was a lovely gesture, and the room was gorgeous! 
The room was decorated lovely, with a really comfy bed, lovely hot shower and everything we could possibly need. 
The only thing I would say is that there was building work being done outside our window which I was worried about when I saw it, but this didn't disturb us during our stay and we slept well. 
Staff were lovely and friendly, and the location was good to visit everywhere around the city. We visited the Guinness factory, which we got to using the tram (the laus) where the station is a 2 min walk across the road, you can also get to the temple bar area, or city centre on there too! And it's really cheap! But even a taxi to the airport only cost us ‚Ç¨25 which we thought was ok! There is also a bus direct from the airport which takes 20 mins and stops a 2 min walk from the hotel which was only ‚Ç¨6 each or something which we got on the way to the hotel :) 
You can easily walk to many of the places around once you get your bearings, it takes about 20 mins to get to the temple bar area for example. 
We used ""James"" stop to get off for the Guinness factory, and ""jervis"" to get off for the city centre, which is only a short walk to the bars :) 
Overall a lovely hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
",5,2016,04,04
219,Good location.  Solid hotel,"If you stay here you have a great location to take the tram around Dublin or walk to city center.  The rooms was clean and staff was friendly.  The breakfast was good,  McGettigans, next door, has a nice beer selection and good fish and chips.  All around, you will have a solid stay here, but its not a 4 or 5 star property.  The best way to get to the hotel is to take the red line tram to Connolly train station (or Busaras) which is right across the street.  That said, the train station is right across the street.  You will hear the trains, but I did not find them overly disturbing.",4,2016,04,03
219,Great location ,"I recently stayed in the North Star and found the hotel to be clean and tidy. The staff were all very helpful and eager to make our stay as pleasant as possible! 

The breakfast available was more than enough to satisfy our needs and set us up for the day!üòÄ

I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay there again!üòÄüëç Michael mc Geown ",4,2016,04,03
219,Dublin birthday break,"We recently stayed in the North Star hotel, Dublin. The hotel was clean, tidy and staff very friendly and accommodating! 

Bed was comfortable and the breakfast on offer was excellent. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend it!üòÄüëç Michael mc Geown",4,2016,04,03
219,Disappointment,"I paid extra to upgrade our travel package to 4 stars.  This hotel was no where near 4 star status.  

The front deskman was not friendly nor helpful.  Having never traveled to Dublin, I was not aware that I needed to use our room key to turn on the power in the hotel room.  We tried the phone, it was not working either.  There were no directions on the phone, I guessed and tried to dial 0, with no luck. There was no booklet with hotel amenities descriptions etc.  When I went down to the front desk to let them know this, the man was short with me and said he would send someone.  

The furnishings were not what was advertised on their website.  The furniture was very old.  The bed was not very comfortable.  The two chairs and a table were adequate, but also old.  During our stay the lock fell out of the bathroom door onto the floor and we were not able to get it back into place.  Twice during our stay the fire alarm went off, one of the times was at 5:45 in a.m..  

When I inquired about parking, the same man at the front desk was slightly more helpful and pulled out a map, drew on it and told me it is over there.  When we returned from a good distance with our luggage, we stated we needed to move the car in the morning due to the lot closing at 7 am.  He suggested another lot further away by a good distance!  We later learned from locals that the hotel area was not a good place to be walking alone back and forth to your car because of the neighborhood.  

The view from our room as that of construction behind the building.  The lights from the construction site were left on all night and could be seen even with the curtains drawn. The elevators were slow and to get to the rooms you had to drag your luggage down a long carpeted hallway, through a key card door and then to the elevators.   

Breakfast was ok, with a good selection.  Our package allowed us the full buffet and it was kept full.  

I rated this poor because the attached restaurant was a little nicer than the hotel.",2,2016,04,02
219,"Handy location, lovely hotel","Stayed at the North Star for a three night break with my sister. Reception staff were very friendly and efficient, and offered us a free upgrade to a premier room. Room was really comfortable and spacious    With all extras topped up each day by housekeeping.

Great buffet breakfast with wide selection of foods and helpful staff in the breakfast room. The hotel's bar and restaurant is lovely and reasonably priced. Staff were particularly helpful in preparing a breakfast for our early departure on last day.

Only 10 min walk from hotel to o'Connell Street where you can pick up sightseeing tours and only 15 min walk to Temple Bar for the evenings and Grafton St for shopping.  ",4,2016,04,02
219,Perfect city hotel,"Excellent location just a 10 minute direct walk to O'Connell Street and around 15 minutes to Temple Bar. Taxis directly across from the hotel with a 5 min ride to excellent restaurants in the centre, taxi only 7 euros. Our room was lovely, excellent breakfast with lots of choice and attentive staff. All hotel staff were very friendly helpful staff.",5,2016,04,02
219,Good Location to visit the city,"Hotel in a great location for a visit to the city very easy to get to by public transport from the airport. Hotel clean and staff very amiable, there is a lot of construction work at the hotel at present which can wake you up fairly early which we were not informed about, but this did not distract from the stay. Breakfast was excellent, we only had continental but it did fill you up for the day. We had a upgraded room but never used the lounge, the one day we did go to get  cup of coffee and chill it was closed for a meeting. A good value hotel though and would not hesitate to go back.",5,2016,03,31
219,Great little hotel,Stayed here recently and enjoyed my stay. The location was convenient to shopping and across from Connelly station. Staff also facilitated an early check in. Only drawback was adjacent Street ( Talbot) not the safest at night,4,2016,03,30
219,No car park.,"If you are arriving by car beware- the hotel does NOT provide a parking facility.

Instead you will be directed to the Connolly Station car park across the busy street then a five minute uphill trek where you will pay 9 euro a day.

We had prepaid and at check in nothing was said about charging items in the adjoining bar and restaurant. . So when my companion had some food she was told she had to pay in cash. I then had to go to the front desk and obtain authorization to charge by giving my credit card information. Getting a refund of the cash was a long, drawn out procedure. 

Why wasn't this explained at checkin? 

Three times the alarm system went off without any explanation.

Entering the elevator on 3 , I pushed 0 for the breakfast room. 1 had already been pushed. At 1 people got on and we went up , then finally back to 1where, at the recommendation of another guest , who had been trying to get to 0 unsuccessfully, I walked down the final flight.

On the day we left we got on at 3, pushed 1, stopped at 2 then went up to 7 then back down to 1. 

On the positive side the hotel has nice rooms, good location and friendly staff. The breakfast is very good and the attached restaurant serves good food.

I would give this establishment a higher rating if parking was provided. ",3,2016,03,29
219,Good place!,"The rooms were very updated and comfortable. The staff, very friendly and helpful. We only stayed one night,  but we were able to get around based on the good location. The only down side is having to take one flight of stairs to get to the elevator (normally not too bad, but with luggage a bit of a hassle). I didn't notice a ground floor elevator if it did exist.",4,2016,03,29
219,"Lovely hotel, good location.","Stayed here just after Christmas - and had a lovely stay. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was great- good size, incredibly clean and had everything we needed - we were facing the railway, which was quite noisey- so this would be my only slight negative of an overall very good stay.
The reception was lovely and the hotel is very beautifully decorated - and looked especially gorgeous at Christmas. The location was great for getting into the heart of Dublin and reaching all the key areas you would want to visit on your trip+ it is right opposite Connolly Train Station which is prefect if you dont want to walk everywhere!
We would definitely stay here again and would recommend the North Star to anyone visiting Dublin.",4,2016,03,28
219,Disappointed ,"We have been in Ireland for 10 days through an Aer Lingus vacation package.  We have stayed at amazing hotels in Amazing cities. This hotels car park is three blocks from hotel, there is not a place to pull over and unload, the staff will not help. The other couple we were staying with had to carry their suitcases up two flights of stairs. We were on 1st floor overlooking an alley/parking garage with hookers!  I would not recommend!",2,2016,03,28
219,Lovely hotel.. Great location ,"We flew to dublin and arrived early in the morning.  A taxi from the airport to the hotel cost us 20 euros. There was an option of a bus but we weren't sure how long it would take. Before we aerived at the hotel i emailed them to see if it would be okay to leave the bags there before our check in time and they said it was fine to do so. Very helpful. When arriving at the hotel our room was already ready so we were able to check in straight away. We booked the premier room which was very spacious and this also gave us access to a lounge upstairs where we could get free coffee and water etc. 
The hotel was a short distance walk from all the main attractions and about a 15 minute walk to the temple bar area. The jotel stadf were very helpful with giving directions etc. Geear customer service. On the evening we ate in the restaurant there. The food was very nice. We would definitely stay there again and have recommended to family and friends. Very enjoyable visit to dublin. ",5,2016,03,28
219,Sleep in the street before this place,"The reason I only gave this a one star review is because I couldn't give them a negative star review. We traveled with a group of 10 and if we were there for any longer than one night we would have left. To keep this brief, here's a list of the problems we had with this hotel. 
1) Rude staff
2) no thermostats in the rooms, it was so hot. 
3) we had to carry out luggage up 3 flights of stairs 
4) there were dirty towels left in our room, when I called to get new ones they told me I could walk down to the front desk and get them 
5) the fire alarm went off 3 different times in the middle of the night 
6) we complained about all these things and they did nothing for us. 
The moral of the story here is, Dublin is an incredible city. Our trip was unbelievable and something I was lucky enough to experience with my entire family. They're a ton of hotels in the city. Don't choose this one.",1,2016,03,27
219,Loved it,"Great hotel in really convenient location right opposite Connolly train station.Quick check in & room clean & comfortable.Had a really nice meal in hotel restaurant  & the staff were very friendly & efficient.bit noisy with the doors slamming shut & the work men outside the next morning but not too bad.had a great breakfast too,would definitely stay here again.great wifi connection as many devices as you want.",5,2016,03,26
219,"Great location, friendly staff","My first trip to Dublin and I was pleased that this hotel was within walking distance to markets, shops, pubs, and O'Connell Street. It seems common for the standard rooms to have one single bed and one double bed so if traveling with a friend, someone is going to have to give up the extra space to sleep. The beds are hard but with all the activity touring the city during the day and night, you are too exhausted to mind. The staff are very friendly and the bar and restaurant were very good.",4,2016,03,26
219,Great! ,"The staff here are so gracious & helpful! We stayed 2 different times  & first time we were so exhausted from an overnight flight & long day prior that we couldn't have been more pleased to have our room ready early.  We rested most of the day  in a pleasant room.  Even the construction going on outside our room didn't bother us!  The bar  & restaurant was a great place to drink  & eat. The fish  & chips were the best!  Room service that night was so appreciated!  The tram was across the street to take us to the train.  I wish I had gotten the name of the tram driver who went out of his way to help us!! Our 2nd visit we upgraded to a suite & had access to the lounge which had soft drinks  & cookies available.  The suite was not what we expected as it did not have a good view or as big as others we have stayed in.  Our room was very cold  & with a phone call we immediately had it taken care of!  Supervisor was a delight! Again the bartenders were the only very friendly ones of our trip.  Again room service was superb!  Beds were very comfortable!  Linens were great! Thank you all for  great stays!! Clean, clean was so apparent! !",4,2016,03,25
219,"Beautifully presented, Friendly staff.","Just returned from the North Star Hotel after staying for one night in a premier double room, went up for the night to see 1975 in the 3 Arena (not far from the hotel). The location was close enough to cafe's and places to grab some food. Staff didn't welcome but they where very friendly. Beautifully presented and the overall hygiene was great. I will definitely be back.",4,2016,03,25
219,Fantastic hotel in dublin City center ,"Firstly, amazing location beside the bus and train station and about a 5 minute walk to the spire on o Connell street. Right beside the luas where you can get to everywhere in Dublin fast and easy. 

Couldn't ask for a better hotel, have stayed in many hotels in Dublin City center but this one is by far the nicest, smooth check in and upgraded to a premier room (only paid for a standard) with access into the lounge where we could get cookies and coffees and water etc. 

Our room was a twin room very modern and spotlessly clean with housekeeping changing towels and cleaning the room everyday. Beside the train line but we didn't hear a thing. 

The staff were very friendly and looked after us well, chatted and gave advice on how to use the luas to get to our concert, brought fresh milk to our room for our tea(hate them uht milks) and looked after our luggage when we had checked out. 

Thanks for a great stay, will definitely be back!",5,2016,03,25
219,Rugby weekend,"Just back from the North Star Hotel in Dublin after a thoroughly enjoyable stay. Right from the start the reception staff could not do enough for us. The rooms were fine apart from the view into the back street. The breakfasts were excellent, but the staff were a bit harassed when busy. The restaraunt was excellent, so much so we ate there three nights in a row. They also have great gluten free options.The location is also excellent",4,2016,03,24
219,Ok but quite disappointed ,"My partner booked me a surprise night away to Dublin for my birthday and I was so excited! After reading the reviews I had no hesitation about coming to the Northstar, also a lot of people were advising for Birthdays and anniversaries the hotel were giving upgrades! The hotel didn't even acknowledge it was my birthday and we got a very outdated room nothing like the pictures show. 

At night the noise was unbearable, I thought our window had been left open but it hadn't and the banging of the doors could make the room shake. You could constantly here other people in the rooms close to you.

Don't get me wrong the rooms were clean and the staff were generally polite but I wouldn't say they go out of there way to make you feel welcome.

The location is great, tram on your doorstep and the Airlink bus just round the corner.

I would recommend the tour bus while you are there we had such a great time.

Also BrasserieSixty6 if you are looking for somewhere to eat other than the hotel, the food was exceptional!",3,2016,03,23
219,Great staff and hotel,We enjoyed our stay and found the staff to be very friendly and knowledgeable.They were a great help in answering all our questions.The room was clean and well equipped with easy temperature settings.,5,2016,03,23
219,"''Pristine, Cosy, Friendly, So Central''","We stayed overnight in the North Star Hotel and were immediately impressed by the quality of decor, the feeling of homliness and the high level of cleanliness in both the public areas and the bedroom/ bathroom (we normally opt to stay in one of the 5 star hotel groups when visiting Dublin and other cities) We could not believe just how central and convenient everything was. For 9 Euro for the full day/night we parked in the nearby Connolly St Station - in the centre of Dublin!! Everything about our stay was amazing the bedroom was so clean and cosy, the bed was really comfortable and the shower power was brilliant. Loved the very attentive and friendly service we got over breakfast ,The quality and range of food available at the buffet breakfast was first class - really delicious.We also enjoyed the decor and the general pristine feel in the dining room. I had to contact the hotel by email the day after our departure to say I had left a very important item behind in the room and I was very impressed at how thorough and speedy the hotel was in acting on this request. It was very reassuring to receive a personal phone call first thing the next morning from the Housekeeping Manager Sharon. Thank you for that Sharon. I'm impressed but certainly not surprised at such a high level of dedication to customer care given the way we were treated by the rest of the staff in the North Star. Love coming to Dublin and we will certainly be staying in the North Star Hotel again - such a friendly and relaxing place to stay.",5,2016,03,22
219,Felt right at home,Great location within walking distance of pretty much the entire city and just around the corner from the AirLink shuttle bus from the airport. Very welcoming and friendly staff. Got a complementary upgrade when we arrived which was really nice. Wonderful continental breakfast in a lovely dining room. Plenty of tourist information available in the lobby. Highly recommended and will definitely be returning for a future stay.,5,2016,03,20
219,"Not bad, works in progress","We were part of a group booking and had two rooms and the hotel was very busy as it was the St Patrick's Day celebrations week.  Our rooms were on the second floor and have to say they were really noisy.  Doors constantly banging at all hours and so much noise from traffic outside we couldn't sleep with the window open.

The beds were comfortable but housekeeping do like to tuck the bedding in rather too tightly, akin to be swaddled like a baby, but appreciate this is down to personal taste and some guests may like this style.

Had a good supply of tea/coffee/milk in the room which was replenished every morning although a little disappointing to find no hot chocolate or complimentary mini packs of biscuits which is a given in most 3 or 4 star hotels these days.

Bathroom was clean and plenty of fresh towels on a daily basis but had a problem with steamy conditions as extraction didn't seem to be working as it should.  Shower power not brilliant, bit of a dribbler rather than a jet at busy times in morning or early evening. 

Bar & restaurant were good, nice atmosphere in the evenings and able to sit in the pleasantly decorated reception area if busy and staff were helpful and friendly. The Tobelerone house cocktail was worth a try and good value.

Couldn't comment on breakfast as our bookings were for rooms only and personally we thought the 12.50 euros pp charge was quite high for this hotel so we used cafe  nearby.

Overall, not a bad stay and understand that building works are still ongoing as lots of banging and drilling going on when we first arrived which then stopped for the public holiday.  Good location for walking to city centre and lots of public transport almost at every corner so not a problem getting about.",4,2016,03,20
219,Will not stay again,"First floor room overlooking dumpster. Train goes by often and shakes the entire place, not to mention the awful noise. Walls are paper thin and we could hear conversations through them, along with everything happening above us (vacuuming, phones vibrating, the bathroom being used) and doors slamming above and down the hall. Our queen bed was actually two twins pushed together. The layout of the hotel is odd and we got lost just trying to find our room. No vending machines anywhere that I could find.

What I will say on the positive side is that everything was clean and the front desk staff was welcoming and patient upon our arrive despite the massive amount of people trying to check in and out at the same time.",2,2016,03,20
219,North Star sines brightly,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a fantastic stay. The food was delicious, the rooms first class and the staff could not be any more helpful. The breakfasts were just perfect - I have never seen a pancake maker in any other hotel and loved it. The selection for breakfast was brilliant and as we were attending concerts starting at 5.30 we had to eat dinner early. This was not a problem and again we were spoilt for choice. The hotel was so convenient as we journeyed by train and it was so close but also close to the town centre. Will certainly return and would recommend to anyone looking for a lovely stay in a beautiful city,",5,2016,03,15
219,Weekend away with other couples,The hotel is very central walking distance to every where and on the flat eAsy access to shopping and night life the wonderful temple bar is also walking distance we had local knowledge and  found everything so handy to the hotel,5,2016,03,14
219,Good Value,"Stayed here recently, we got upgraded on check in, rooms were good size breakfast was good car parking across the street at Connolly Station for 9 euro per day, staff were friendly, 15 min walk to Temple Bar, would stay again.",4,2016,03,13
219,ok hotel,"Staff were very nice except the manager was fairly rude. Hotel is close to the city without being IN it. The rooms were average and needed some repaired but overall were very nice., Beds were very comfortable. Area is a little ifie at night. ",3,2016,03,11
219,Depends on the room,"Our first room was on the 2nd floor, facing a construction sight.  Nice enough room, comfortable bed. clean and actually quiet considering it was an active construction site. They didn't seem to get started too early.  

BE CAREFUL getting out of the showers in Ireland. The bottom of the tub is about 6 inches higher than the ground and I nearly fell when getting out.

Our second room (came back for two nights at the end of a week long trip) was on the first floor. It obviously had yet to be upgraded. A cat urine smell came from the heater, but leave it off and no problems. Bed was comfortable.  Slamming of the entry door was a little overbearing though.  It could be easily cured by putting felt pads and I let the staff know.

Staff was amazing!  Very friendly.  Don't bother buying the breakfast, the restaurant is nice, but you can get more for half the price walking a block away.

The workout room was very well equipped. There is a sauna, but none of us could find it.",3,2016,03,10
219,Great Hotel!!!,We stayed here for three nights and we loved it. The hotel staff was so helpful. We booked through groupon and for some reason our reservation hadn't gone through. The hotel staff corrected the error very quickly and made our whole journey amazing! Thank you North Star Hotel!,5,2016,03,09
219,Central,"Room nice and spacious. Bit of mold in bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was just ok. Good location and great price. It says it's a 4 star hotel but I would have said more 3 star

No car park at hotel. There is a car park across the road in the train station, didn't seem very safe as very open",4,2016,03,09
219,Great customer service & lovely hotel,"I stayed last weekend & have to say it was a pleasure. We were given a free upgrade to premier which included use of lounge facilities with free coffee & water plus sofas to relax. 
The rooms were nice & modern with a good sized bathroom. 
The gym was better furbished than most hotel gyms which was a great surprise. 
I would recommend this hotel, it's a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar area and the team is just over the road. ",4,2016,03,09
219,Rooms and location,"This hotel is in a great location. I will say that the room we were located in had a view of what looked like a huge dumpster. We were located on the first floor and there was some kind of construction going on directly outside of our window. There was a lot of debris and construction material within feet of the glass. Additionally, the bathroom tiles had mildew and the floor looked as if it was not routinely scrubbed. Overall, the hotel staff were nice and the location is very convenient. ",3,2016,03,09
219,Absolutely fantastic overnight stay!,"This was a last minute booking and so glad we booked into this hotel. We arrived @ 10am and was aware we could not check in the room until 2pm. We had the pleasure of meeting Ella upon our arrival who did her upmost to get us settled in as quick as possible. We was given a room at 12pm unfortunately as we got there it had not yet been cleaned so immediately we got up-graded to a club premier suit, Lovely rooms and comfortable beds. All of the staff (Reception/Bar/Waiter/Waitresses) were all so lovely, very pleasant and extremely welcoming. As we were only there a night and had a late check out we thought we would sample room service on the morning for breakfast this was also beautifully served and very tasty, not forgetting the meal prior to our departure was just perfect. I have stayed in quite a few 4 & 5 star hotels and this is one of the most welcoming and accommodating I have ever been to. Could not fault anything with this hotel. We will definitely be returning again this year!",5,2016,03,09
219,fantastic,This is our 2nd time to this hotel and a huge change from 6 years ago only to the decor which is lovely and decorated to high standard the rooms are great the staff are very pleasant and helpful and the food was just lovely will be going back soon,5,2016,03,09
219,Very enjoyable long weekend stay.,"Stayed for a long weekend and had overall a very enjoyable time. Very good location for access to the city centre and Rail / DART links via Connolly station which is directly across the road.

Staff were excellent overall. A slight disagreement with the lady on reception upon our check-in who insisted we had made a reservation for two rooms, even though we didn't make the reservation and after showing her the confirmation from the booking agency to the contrary. Beside that, the staff couldn't have been more helpful!

4 star hotel and I think the rating was just about justified for the Premium room we had. Good size room, well equipped and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in! Rooms noise was noticeable, both from the street and from the hallway. Also you were quite aware of the noise you were making for other guests as the floorboards were very squeaky. 

Overall pretty happy and would certainly look to stay at the hotel again.",4,2016,03,08
219,Good 4*,"Huge room. Really, really quiet. I was a bit nervous reading some of the other reviews about the noise but we didn't hear a thing. We must have been on the other side. Anyway. Room was great, bed was really comfy and it had everything you'd want and expect - good shower, lots of space, WiFi, room service... It's 5 stops on the bus from the airport so nice and easy to find. Breakfast a bit pricey but delicious and the bar/kitchen next door is great for a pint. Would stay here again. ",5,2016,03,08
219,Lovely stay! Be sure to upgrade if possible!,"Upon arriving at the hotel, everyone was very friendly and keen to help us and we were able to put our luggage away until our room was ready. The first room we were taken to was really small with a double bed and a single bed. Something about having an extra bed in the room really puts me off so we called about upgrading. We were told that we could upgrade to a suite for ‚Ç¨30 per night so ‚Ç¨90 in total. We were put in the James Joyce (I think) suite and it was absolutely beautiful, ONE bed, a lovely bathroom and floor to ceiling windows. Unfortunately, being on the 7th floor meant we could see into offices and flats nearby but that didn't affect us too much. The restaurant at the hotel was also lovely and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Overall, the hotel was in a relatively central location (20 min walk to Temple Bar,) and after moving we were put in a lovely room! I would definitely return to this hotel when I next visit Dublin.",4,2016,03,08
219,Trip to Dublin for my Partners Birthday,"All the staff were very welcoming, friendly and happy to help in an possible way. On arrival our room was upgraded (double to king). The view from the rooms balcony was lovely and the condition of the room was pristine. As we were having dinner in the hotel that night we received a voucher for two free proseccos with our dinner. The food was tasty and the cocktails even better. Over all a lovely place to stay, we will definitely be back in the future. Good value for money.",5,2016,03,08
219,"Great Stay, Great Location",Found The North Star Hotel to be a great hotel. Very good location. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were of a very high standard and spotlessly clean. First class breakfast. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again. Well done North Star Hotel. ,5,2016,03,07
219,Great Customer Service!!,"The hotel staff could not have been nicer. It is conveniently located at the train station and in walking distance of everything. Very convenient from the airport, which was key. The rooms are comfortable enough. I would splurge (not a huge difference) for the upgrade to the deluxe rooms for a bigger bed, more space and access to an amazing coffee machine (honestly the coffee machine will pay for your upgrade). The gym is nice and clean. The lobby is nicely appointed, classic, and welcoming. We went during the renovation and, from the pictures, it looks even better now.",4,2016,03,06
219,Fantastic,"Stayed here for 2 nights.  What a lovely place.  The rooms were lovely and the bar and restaurant were fantastic.  Friendly staff, especially behind the bar.  Its a little out of the way of the main area of Dublin but we walked there without a problem.  There were a few bars close to the hotel too.  Will definitely stay there again.  Great value for money, clean and comfortable and a warm welcome.  We couldn't ask for any more.",5,2016,03,05
219,North Star Dublin..well worth the money,"My friend and I visit Dublin every year for our birthday., we always stay in the North Star.. Over the last few years the hotel has been updated the rooms are so modern and bathrooms too.. The beds are so comfy and staff so friendly.. We got upgraded to the premier suite as it was our birthday.. Fridge in the room dressing gown & slippers even a balcony.. We had 24 hr access to the premier lounge on the 7th floor where we had latte's or coffee out of the machine free whenever we wanted and bottles of still or sparkling water.. Such a nice touch and so clean & modern .. The breakfast in the Northstar is fantastic compliments to the chef.. Would def recommend this hotel to anyone heading to Dublin,  across the road from Connelly train station and a short walk to all the shops..Maria at reception is such a friendly and helpful member of staff and a credit to the hotel..Ciaron the concierge, a lovely man who was always there to help.  Thanks you North Star for making our stay in Dublin a really enjoyable one..We will def be back!!! Xx

219,2 year anniversary,"I visited Dublin for my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend, we had an early flight and the thought of traipsing the streets with our suitcases was not a good one. We found our hotel on the off chance we could leave our bags, they were extremely helpful and let us check in at 8:30 in the morning, we were able to settle in and freshen up before exploring! The restaurant was also lovely and the bar open when we returned each day from exploring! I would definitely recommend staying here and will be returning here myself again! ",5,2016,03,03
219,Second visit... maintained high standards ,I have reviewed this hotel once before and we made a second visit just last week . The hotel is well equipped very clean and the breakfast service was once again outstanding. thank you very much for a lovely welcome .,5,2016,03,02
219,Lovely place to stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights last weekend. After our flight arrived in Dublin and 9am we made our way to the hotel to drop off the bags and to our surprise the rooms were ready! This was great as were able to freshen up. Rooms are lovely and comfortable, heating and air conditioning available as well as tea and coffee making facilities. Staff were absolutely lovely and could not do enough for you. Restaurant food looked nice and was not overly priced compared to the rest of Dublin. Check out was not until 11.30am which was great for us and they kept our bags for us and didn't even mind us sitting in the lounge area waiting for our flight. Amazed by the value we got as this hotel was lovely- would definitely stay again.",5,2016,03,02
219,Friendly people,"The people in the hotel were friendly the rooms are okay , shower standard is very low for people who are longer then 1,70 for the rest bathroom also okay , the location is very nice, everything you need is near",3,2016,03,01
219,Perfection once again!,"I stay at this hotel every time I visit Dublin and each stay gets better and better! 
Could not fault the staff, the room, the food, nothing! 
Always sad to leave.. The new rooms that are being added on will be a fantastic addition to an already wonderful venue.",5,2016,02,29
219,Amazing,"Can not fault the price, location, rooms or service. Loved the place. We will always come back to this hotel. 
Try to get a room above the first floor as I found them nicer overall.
And their is a batman who genuinely looks after you",5,2016,02,28
219,A lovely place to stay ,"I would stay here again as it is a clean and well presented hotel.
The staff were lovely and friendly it felt like staying with friends.
A good central location as it wasn't too much of a walk into town to have a wander around. 
Taxi and train all nearby if needed though.
My first trip to Dublin and it was a positive experience will stay here again.",5,2016,02,28
219,Wonderful warm Irish welcome ,"I chose this hotel purely by researching Dublin hotels on trip adviser and wasn't disappointed.  We arrived at 9.30am not expecting to be able to check in but hoping to drop off our cases, not only were our rooms ready but we had been upgraded! I mentioned that was a lovely surprise as we were here celebrating my daughter and her partners engagement.  We came back that evening for them to find an engagement card from the staff and chocolates! How thoughtful! The staff couldn't have been more accomodating, happily printing off our boarding cards when asked, nothing was too much  trouble. The whole hotel decor is lovely,  spotlessly clean, rooms have everything you could wish for. Just a 10 minute stroll to Temple Bar.  Highly recommend, would definately stay again. (Taxi from airport was ‚Ç¨24)",5,2016,02,28
219,Amazing service!,My friends and I stayed at the North Star Hotel for a little holiday in Dublin. The hotel was extremely helpful and accommodating to our needs. The room was fantastic and clean and I would definitely choose The North Star Hotel next time I visit. We had a wonderful time!,5,2016,02,25
219,Spring trip to Ireland,"Visited Dublin for the first time ever in June. Looked online for a hotel to stay at with my son. Saw the reviews the North Star Hotel received and decided to stay here. We were not disappointed. Since we arrived at the hotel so early in the morning after a night flight from New York it was too early to check in. But they hotel had no problems checking in our luggage and watching it for us while we went and toured the city until our room was ready. Hotel is conveniently located near the bus and trains which was perfect for us since we took the bus from the airport. Nice walk from the hotel into the center of the city. 
Room was very nice. Took a while to figure out how to get the lights and electricity to work in the room. Yes I know how to flip a switch. What I didn't know is that a room key in the slot on the wall was necessary. Something we do not have in hotels in the USA. Perhaps the front desk should tell people from other countries on how to get the lights to work. Or maybe it is more fun for them not to. LOL
Overall I highly recommend the North Star for those visiting Dublin",4,2016,02,24
219,Bar,"I visited the north star hotel a few weeks ago and I loved the bar, especially the bar man Sean!!! His cocktails were delicious and very reasonable for the price. Will definitely be back to visit! :-)",5,2016,02,23
219,Lovely Stay and Top Shelf Service,"Spent 3 days in Dublin for the first time.  Our rooms were nice and clean and the hotel is located conveniently close to anything you want to see in Dublin.  That said, I was most impressed with the service we received.  Since it was our first time in Ireland from USA, we weren't sure what to expect.  It wasn't just the little things like using the room key to turn on the lights but even the big things - we lost a cell phone on our last day and the reception staff shipped it to us right away.  Every staff we came across treated us like family and made sure our needs were met.  I plan on coming back and thought about staying at another hotel but I will happily be staying at the North Star!",5,2016,02,22
219,We had the best time at the North Star hotel ,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the North Star as part of a present is arranged for him. The service was absolutely brilliant in the hotel and bar, all of the staff made us feel welcome it was a pleasure.
The location of the hotel was great, taxi drivers commented on the hotel being a great choice due to its central location and I totally agree.
The food and drinks from the bar and night service were great we thoroughly enjoyed it, we couldn't have asked for a better stay and I'd like to thank all of the staff for a great stay, we'd happily stay again.",5,2016,02,22
219,I just love the North Star Hotel,"I have stayed at the North Star Hotel twice.  It is a great location for visiting Dublin.  You can walk every place or catch a bus or trolley very close by.  The restaurant was also very nice.  They even accommodated my ""extra vegetables no carbs"" with a complaint.  I would book this hotel again for a future visit to Dublin",5,2016,02,21
219,Great stay,"Went to Dublin for the first time and stopped for 2nights at this hotel. Quite well located if you're doing the sight seeing scene but also not too far away from the temple bar area if you want to sample the nightlife of Dublin! 
Will definitely recommend. ",5,2016,02,21
219,2 Night Stay,"Didn't eat at hotel or drink so can't comment on restaurant, however did order room service. Pizza was lovely. Location great from train station but as for bars i.e the temple bar they are on the opposite side of the city, reception staff welcoming and room was overall spotless. However the pillows were not great, very hard. But I do realise not everyone likes soft pillows but there was a group of 6 with me and we all had same issue of hard pillows. Shower wasn't very powerful either. Great facilities in room - iron, ironing board, kettle, cups and great air conditioning.",3,2016,02,20
219,Great stay!!,"Stayed here for one night with my boyfriend. The hotel itself is lovely, from the moment you walk in the d√©cor and staff are so welcoming. Rooms are good and comfortable. The breakfast is out of this world and was even better that they served until 11am on a Sunday which after a night out is just what you want. Location is great with a taxi rank right outside the hotel. You can probably walk it to all the central areas however, we chose just to get a taxi as was only ‚Ç¨6 and was willing to pay it to get around quickly as only there for one night. The only downfall was where our room was the view was a lot of building works and a lot of noise which sounded like kitchen bins and doors etc quite early in the morning. Apart from that this hotel is great and would highly recommend.",4,2016,02,17
219,Great hotel!,"Stayed at the North Star Hotel for a weekend away with friends. It was very convenient as the coach from the airport dropped us off directly outside the hotel. The hotel allowed us to check in early, which was great. 

The rooms were very comfortable - each had 2 single beds and a double bed, in a modern style. Each room has a safe, iron and ironing board and tea and coffee making facilities.

We did not have breakfast included in our deal, but for ‚Ç¨12.50 we had an excellent breakfast - full cooked and continental breakfast which was lovely. 

The concierge was very helpful and gave us good suggestions on places to visit! All the hotel staff were very helpful! A great stay!",5,2016,02,16
219,WEEKEND AWAY,"This hotel wasn't as near to Temple Bar as I was lead to believe. However, it was clean, accommodating, and the breakfast was lovely. Unfortunately there were workmen present when we visited, so was a bit noisy. Our room was spotless. Reception staff were obliging, and the Hotel bar was lovely, with excellent service from men of all ages, who were charming. Paddy....oh dear, he was amazing. Such a charming old man.",4,2016,02,16
219,good location,"Hotel is in a very good location for the dart, which is across the road, and O'Connell street, which is just down the road a bit, about 5 minutes walk. Plenty of local bars  and eating places in the area. Breakfast is 12.50 euros and is very good, plenty of everything in a good relaxing atmosphere. Free wi fi is good.",4,2016,02,16
219,Weekend in Dublin,"You won't go far wrong with this hotel. It does look a bit tired from the outside but once you step inside, any reservations you may have will be dispelled!! 
We were upgraded to a room on the 5th floor, which had a super king size bed and flat screen TVs. With the upgrade, we had access to the Premier Lounge on floor 7 which had unlimited tea and coffee and great views of Dublin.
You are a 20 minute walk away from Temple Bar and a 10 minute walk from  O'Connell Street, which makes this a perfect location.
The restaurant adjacent to the Hotel served great food, and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. 
A very enjoyable stay!!",4,2016,02,15
219,Brill hotel and location,Amazing hotel clean great location also very close to the city centre also Connolly station is right across the way modern hotel staff were also very friendly and welcoming on arrival great stay !!!!!,5,2016,02,15
219,weekend in dublin,"great hotel, does not look like much from the outside but when you get inside its quite impressive. my only feedback would be this..pay attention to the little things, clearly work is being done on keeping the hotel and rooms up to standard but some of the finish in the rooms needs attention. the toilet roll holder is in accessable so you have to take the roll off!, the shower pressure in my room (150) was that weak i had to take a bath, also im not a short guy 5ft 10ins but i struggled to step from the bath to the floor, they are to high. Breakfast is great and the staff are very friendly and attentive. 8/10 .....would have been 9 if not for the afforementioned issues.",4,2016,02,14
219,A great place to stay!,"At first, the outside seemed sketchy, but it is just a fun, vintage hotel that is gorgeous inside. The staff was entirely friendly and informative! The hotel itself was beautiful and very roomy. It was a great location and close to many restaurants and attractions!",5,2016,02,13
219,Lovely hotel!,"I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews posted to this site but my concerns were unfounded. I enjoyed a wonderful stay at the North Star. First is the convenience. The hotel is the fifth stop on the airport bus route and clearly identified. Just hop off the bus and cross the street.

The hotel itself is charming. The rooms have been recently renovated so everything was beautifully maintained. The beds were very comfortable. I didn‚Äôt experience any of the train noise others have mentioned. I heard some distant pedestrian noises but nothing disruptive. Perhaps I was on the other side of the building or they‚Äôve improved the soundproofing? There was loud noise from a party in the room across the hall from me but a call to the front desk resolved the issue.  

The breakfast included delicious porridge and Irish soda bread along with the usual traditional fare (bacon, eggs, toast). The staff is efficient, welcoming, and very helpful. I‚Äôm planning to stay at the North Star Hotel again during my next visit to Dublin.",5,2016,02,12
219,"Lovely room,excellent location friendly and helpful staff","We stayed in a lovely refurbished room, the hotel is very near the City Centre and located very near a Luas Line and Busarus and Connolly Stations. The reception , housekeeping and bar/restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful, the food was lovely plus it was great value for money, will definitely stay again!",5,2016,02,11
219,21st Birthday weekend!,"Such a brilliant hotel! I booked this hotel for the weekend for my birthday and it was just perfect! Our room was stunning, very comfy bed.  My friend had made sure my suprise bottle of prosecco was waiting for my arrival and it was just what i neededüòúAte in the restaurant and had a few drinks in the bar and it was all very tastey. The whole hotel was just beautiful! Friendly staff and a very homely place to stay. Deffinately will be returning again!",5,2016,02,11

219,Second visit as good as the first,"Myself and my wife have just got back from our second stay at the North Star Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it as much as our first stay last year. From the moment you walk into the reception area you are given a warm welcome and within minutes are on your way to your room which are beautifully decorated. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in although on Friday & Saturday morning there was a little noise from the building site outside the rooms as new rooms are being built but the noise was tolerable. The North Star is a great base to stay as the city centre is within a few minutes walk and of course their are many bars along the way to stop in and have a pint of Guinness. We ate in Mcgettigans Cookhouse which is located within the hotel on our first night and the food was superb before retiring to the bar to end the evening with a few drinks.
Without a doubt we will be back for a third stay when we next visit Dublin as its a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location with fantastic service and an ever more fantastic price. 10/10 from us.",5,2016,02,09
219,Great hotel with friendly service,"Stayed at The North Star last weekend for the 6 Nations Rugby and couldn't have chosen a better hotel.  The staff were friendly and helpful, located directly opposite Connolly Station made travel to Landsdown Road so easy.  The only complaint was that we could hear the rooms either side.  Not noisy revellers, but other guests using the shower and even plugging in to sockets.  Nevertheless will definitely return.",4,2016,02,09
219,Amazing Hotel,"We visited the North Star for New Years Eve in Dublin. 

Firstly, the staff are all super super lovely. They could not have been more welcoming, and during our time were so nice and helpful. 

The hotel had clearly recently had more renovations and it looked beautiful. Carpets were lovely and bouncy, there was still the very faint smell of fresh paint in the halls and everywhere was really clean. 

The Christmas decorations were actually beautiful, and there was plenty of seating in the lobby and in a little nook on the corridor. 

The room was plenty big, with tea and coffee, safe, large t.v, and a full sized bath with shower over. Beds were really comfortable. I have a spinal condition, so can often struggle in hotel beds but this one I didn't want to leave. The room had its own temperature control too, so you could keep yourself comfortable. 

Breakfast was fabulous. Lots of hot and cold options, which were constantly restocked by the staff, and everywhere was kept really clean. 

The hotel is quite well located. It's right in the airport bus route, and opposite the train station. It's literally a 10-15 minute stroll up to the Main Street and shops, and is 5 minutes along from the bus station. 

To summarise, I am (completely unexpectedly) desperate to get back to Dublin and am refusing to stay anywhere except for the North Star. 

We had a truly amazing stay, and can't wait to come back! ",5,2016,02,08
219,weekend,"this was a fantastic hotel all the staff was great and nothing was not to much trouble, the rooms was very clean and very comfy, the food looked and tasted fantastic and not over charged. in the morning you can have a full or continental breakfast.",5,2016,02,04
219,Birthday weekend,"My fiance treated me to 4 nights in Dublin to celebrate my 30th birthday. Neither of us had been to Ireland before but we will definitely return and would definitely stay at the North Star Hotel again!

We arrived earlier than the stated check in time to find out they didn't have our reservation - panic! Maria on reception was lovely and said she would look in to it so we went for a coffee in the adjoining restaurant/bar McGettigan's. Thankfully we didn't have to wait long before Maria returned to say everything was sorted and we could check in early. We were in a premier suite on the 7th floor - the room was bright, clean and comfortable. What more could you want?! The bed was amazing! The bathroom looked like it had been newly refurbished but there were a few finishing touches which were missed such as the toilet roll holder not attached to the wall properly and damaged tiles. 

Tea & coffee making facilities in the room as well as a coffee machine & snacks in the premier lounge were a great addition. 
We had prepaid for breakfast and found it fine, the cooked breakfast was lovely (the sausages were fab) but there wasn't much choice of continental breakfast - that didn't bother us, 2 helpings of Irish breakfast each was the perfect way to start the day!!! :-D We were on holiday after all, who wants a healthy breakfast?!

Location was great, about 8 mins walk to the main shopping area & O'Connell Street. Connelly station and the LUAS stop right across the road. If you don't want to walk everywhere jump on the luas. Really easy. We also caught the DART train to visit Howth & Malahide. 

We booked a table for dinner in McGettigan's one evening and in doing so received 2 free glasses of prosecco. The food was great value and great quality. I had fish & chips and my partner had the venison casserole. The chocolate brownie was to die for!!!!!! The best we've ever had! We also had the sliders to share one afternoon for lunch - also delicious! David was our waiter and worked extremely hard. Kathleen is also a great asset to the hotel - she was there all the time, breakfast, lunch & dinner!

As it was my birthday I received a box of chocolates and a card was posted under our door - such a lovely gesture.
Massive thanks to the North Star Hotel for their fantastic hospitality - in particular Maria and the duty manager Ela (I think?!) We will be back! ",4,2016,02,03
219,"North Star Hotel & Premier Club, Dublin","We stayed in this hotel between 18 August -21 August 2015
The front of the building is ok, not great, not bad either. They built an extension at the back.The check in process reasonably quick.
The staff was friendly. We stayed in Room 216, facing the front road.

Location
It‚Äôs 7- 10 minutes walk from O‚ÄôConnel Street and City centre in the relatively busy road.
There are trams just opposite the hotel that can take you to various places in the city.
The draw back on this hotel, because we had front facing room (which is in the original building), there wasn't a lift in this part of the building. So we had to carry our luggage up the stairs.
We didn‚Äôt see any porter in the reception. It didn‚Äôt bother us much but I can imagine an elderly person would certainly need help to carry their cases up and down.

Room
Our room is quite spacious, reasonably clean with ensuite bathroom.
There were tea/coffee making facilities in the room and we got ‚Äúcomplimentary‚Äù wifi, which I think is very good extra service. Although we stayed in the room that faced the main road, the room was relatively quiet at night because the window is double glazed.

We also tried their Sauna Room at the basement, next to the Gym area, which can be use for all guest hotel. It was clean with towels, etc provided.

Breakfast 
Breakfast room is located in the basement of this hotel. The space is clean and a reasonable size. The food was great. Plenty of various types of food, hot food, cold, etc with a good standard of food.

We enjoyed so much staying in this hotel and we recommend this hotel if you ever visit Dublin.",3,2016,02,03
219,Another great stay at the North Star hotel,"Having stayed in the North Star last year for a friends hen party and having a fantastic stay,we decided to go back this weekend to celebrate friends 40th birthday.  From the minute you enter the hotel you are greeted by warm,friendly and polite staff.  Maria on reception is great and Claire is so lovely and will go out of her way to make sure you have a great stay.  

The hotel is having extensive work being carried out but this didn't affect our stay. We ate and drank on several occasions in the cookhouse bar and we couldn't complain about anything,again all the staff were great.

The hotel is 15/20 minutes walk to the templebar area which we didn't mind,although late at night we would get a taxi back to the hotel.

Myself and 2 friends had a great 2 night stay and can't wait to return.",4,2016,02,01
219,North Star Hotel,"Very good Hotel. City centre Situated Close to buses & trains. Very comfortable hotel great staff  Good selection of food & drink. I would recommend this Hotel to those looking for a well situated very clean hotel.  Breakfasts are very good. Big selection of food. Big Gymnasium. Sauna a big plus. 
",4,2016,02,01
219,Otherwise Ok but watch out for house keeping,Myself and my boyfriend went for the night. It was good and good bar food. We upgraded to a premium room. Check out is not until 12. The door was locked from the inside and yet a maid barged in at 9:30am!Absolutely frightening the life out of us both from our sleep. The lady on reception was very apologetic. Never before in anywhere we have stayed have we had this happen. ,2,2016,02,01
219,Was good apart from the lift and breakfast wasn't the best,Lift never worked correctly always taking you up down and everywhere and the breakfasts had a lot off variety but didn't think it was to much of a high standard everything else was spot on and can't complain about anything else there was building work going on but didn't really impact us with noise even tho we was in the same side as the work ,4,2016,01,31
219,Very good!,"Recently stayed here for one night while visiting Dublin.
On arrival, reception could not find our booking which took a while to resolve, however, I have to say the staff were fantastic and gave us an upgrade to a fabulous room which we gratefully accepted.
Room was spacious and very quiet!
Well located hotel and would probably stay again!
Tip:
This place was yet another bargain found on Trivago!",4,2016,01,31
219,Birthday weekend!,Good hotel for a trip away visiting from the UK...lovely & sophisticated reception & cookhouse restaurant attached (definitely worth a visit as it's nice for food or even just evening drinks) the bathroom in the room was quite dated but due it's job & was acceptable & clean. A bit of a walk from Temple bar etc (20mins) but only a few mins away from the main shopping street & buses! ,4,2016,01,30
219,A nice little hotel but make sure you have your walking shoes on.,"We have just returned from our stay at the North Star hotel in Dublin and overall I was pleasantly surprised. 

After reading other reviews I think we got lucky with our room as although we were at street level we were nowhere near the train tracks so noise was kept to a nice minimum. I can agree with other guests about the noise especially from the building work as this is very noticeable when walking round the hotel however.

The room itself was comfortable and did the job. My only criticism was the bathroom was on the small side and in need of an update.

We ate one night in the restaurant attached and although the two meals for less than ‚Ç¨20 early bird option is a good deal I was a little disappointed in the food received. The chicken was very greasy and when I asked for mashed potato instead of fries I still ended up with fries. My partner on the other hand really enjoyed her meal so not all bad.

If breakfast is not included in your room price make sure you investigate the numerous cafes around the hotel who offer the same types of meals but for at least half the price.

The drink prices at the hotel bar are on the pricey side as you'd expect but they were nowhere in the region that some people seem to exaggerate about Dublin being ""so expensive!"". If you want an alternative there are always a number of bars within walking distance of the hotel.

My only negative about this hotel is really the location. Although it claimed it is within walking distance of Temple Bar on the information we received you are looking at least at a 20 minute stiff walk to get there, so not perfect for older guests or people who may struggle to walk for that length of time.  Also the surrounding area is not the greatest as when walking to O'Connell Street for example you will pass a number of homeless people which is sad but doesn't make a nice atmosphere or place to pass through.  I certainly wouldn't want to walk through this area on my own at night.

Overall the hotel did a job and if in Dublin again I would consider it again but look for somewhere in a nicer location first.",4,2016,01,30
219,Don't book if you want sleep,On arrival friendly staff lovely reception area . Rooms ok basic but freshly painted and clean. Had couple of drinks in bar/ restaurant. Breakfast was nice plenty of choice. Good location just 5 min walk from o Connell street. Although it says it 4star hotel I would def say it only 3star. Now as for noise train line just outside bedroom window so from early hrs every 20mins train goes past and if that was not bad enough from about 8.00 extension being built below bedroom window so there was workmen shouting and banging and to top it off at 8.30 staff started hoovering corridor and nearby bedrooms. I booked this hotel after readin great reviews but they must have been staying in different part of hotel to us.,3,2016,01,29
219,Friendly Staff & Great Breakfast,"The rooms are as advertised and the staff and really welcoming and want to help. The late night pizza room service can take a while to arrive but its worth the wait!
If you want to use the sauna you'll need to ask reception to heat it up in advance (FYI these are single sex saunas).
Breakfast was worth every penny, but get there early (there enough food but you may have to queue for a table first).

219,Great hotel ,"Lovely hotel friendly staff and great location.

Went to a concert in the 3arena 22nd January me and my friend checked into a room that was spacious and clean, the balcony over looked a building site tho the noise was not a problem as we where getting ready to go out, 

The reception staff where very helpful in explaining the best way to get to the arena and nice places to eat, 

",4,2016,01,29
219,Great service and very good value.,We went for a weekend away and wanted somewhere quite central. It turned out to be a good choice to stay here. Right from checking in the staff were excellent. We were very happy with every aspect but have to add a special mention to Rebecca in the restaurant who' gave exceptional service. Definitely a place we would stay at again.,5,2016,01,28
219,Lovely Dublin Break,"Good location, good hotel. Really happy with the service and the service and the room. We upgraded our room which gave us a more spacious room and access to the club lounge which was a nice novelty. It is within walking distance to temple bar although enough of a distance away to not feel busy. Try the restaurant, especially the sharing pudding!!",5,2016,01,27
219,30th Birthday treat,"Stayed Thursday and Friday night for my 30th birthday. The bus dropped us just around the corner, the receptionists were lovely from the outset. Despite our early arrival our room was ready and we were upgraded :) 

The room was spacious, bright and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. As we were only staying 3 days in Dublin we spent most of our day out sight seeing, but did make use of the restaurant and bar in the hotel. The staff there were great and drink prices were reasonable for Dublin.

We had continental breakfast included in our stay, which we found more than enough, although, a few biscuits or pastries would have been appreciated with morning tea/coffee. The breakfast room wasn't as well presented as the other rooms but was again clean and fit for purpose.

Only downside was the proximity to the train tracks. This wasn't much of a problem but could be a little noisy in the morning if you want to sleep in.",5,2016,01,27
219,Perfect Location and Wonderful Hotel,"My wife booked a two day trip to Dublin for my 50th birthday and chose the North Star for our stay.  From the moment we stepped into the reception the staff were friendly and attentive, which never wavered across the next 48 hours.

On both nights we made use of the onsite bar/restaurant McGettigans which was a lovely experience.  We sat at the bar on both evenings and the service was first class as were the drinks and the food. 

Our room was a good size and although it was close to the railway line we barely noticed any noise at all from the trains.

I'd have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.  I'd definitely stay there again.",5,2016,01,27
219,Location location location ,"Stayed at the North Star for a weekend break. We had never been to been to Dublin before so we were keen to explore the city. The location of the hotel is great. The popular Temple Bar area is walking distance. The hotel room was clean, nice and good standard for the price. I'm sure I will be back again. ",4,2016,01,25
219,Disappointment of the club lounge.,"Stayed at this hotel 23/24 Jan 2016. The hotel itself is lovely, staff friendly, hotel clean and across the road from Connolly station.  The only downside was we paid a little extra for the Premier room to avail of the Club Lounge only to find no refreshments or papers. There was tea/coffee/ water which were available in our room anyway (not the water)  We will be staying here again I'm sure but won't be paying extra for the premier rooms as it isn't worth it.",4,2016,01,25
219,Not bad for the location ,"4*

Firstly- check in was quick and simple. It was early Saturday afternoon and busy but the staff got us checked in as quick as possible. The reception area is beautiful, like, really nicely decorated. 

Then you walk to your room. You sort of travel in to an alternate universe... Walking down a long long long white corridor to the lifts and rooms. Totally different to the feel as you get when you enter the hotel

We had a room starting 1 (164) so you'd think this would be on the ground, or 1st floor. Well we were a little confused as reception told us to go up a floor In the lift and when a member of staff saw us looking puzzled, she told us to go up a level. 164 on level 2? Ok? 

Except it wasn't. 

It was on the floor we were originally on. 

ANYWAY....

We got the room and it was a good size. There was aircon, a safe, a tv and usual amenities. The bed was also comfy. The decor was whites, creams, a lovely dark slate colour paper on one wall. And the bathroom? TERRACOTTA. In your face... Again, not awful but just out of place!!

There was 1 thing however, a strange thing... The other guest heard her name being spoken whilst she was in the bathroom, when the door was closed... I know that the hotel is old but could it be haunted??? We may have met them!

Breakfast- buffet style for ‚Ç¨12.50 is not a bad price at all!

In total, 4* for 4*. Slight room for improvement but good for the price and location",4,2016,01,25
219,Ed Sheeran Concert,A wonderful experience and pleasurable stay. The Staff were friendly and accomadating. Great value for money. Located in the city centre so it was convenient to all the local tourist attractions and shopping,4,2016,01,24
219,Let down,"Hotel itself is ok, a bit dated but it's very central. The staff were pleasant. 
The room we had was by an elevator and security door which slammed all night due to foot traffic. I know you can't really control the drunken guests and their noise levels but maybe sound proofing the rooms better could be an option? 
If you are in Dublin for a drunken experience I would recommend but not for a quiet getaway.
",2,2016,01,24
219,Breakfast was the only thing wrong,"Two of us stayed here one night and I am glad to say the only problem I encountered was the white pudding in the buffet at breakfast, I would expect paying four hundred and eighty nine Euros for 2 singles to have a top notch breakfast (I have encountered better breakfasts when staying at far more cheaper establishments) as I have all ready mentioned in this review other than the issue with the breakfast we encountered no additional problems.",4,2016,01,23
219,Centrally located,"Stayed at the North Start in January with my mum for a few days.  When we arrived we were giving an upgrade to a premier room, can't compare the difference in premier and a standard room but we were given access to the premier lounger, were there was a tea/coffee machine, bottles of water and biscuits.  We had breakfast both of the mornings we were there, we had paid extra for the full Irish breakfast but not sure it was worth the money.  It was just a buffet of typical fry foods, although if you're happy enough with cereal, toast and fruit this is all included in the continental breakfast.  Any hotel I've stayed at usually gives an Irish breakfast as part of your breakfast with no extra costs. The hotel is easily located to the transport system, we got the bus which left us at the bus station, the hotel isn't even a 5 min walk away.  Connolly station and the tram service are right across the road as well.  The shopping area of O'Connell street is about a 5 - 10 minute walk away and to get to Grafton Street its about 20 minutes.",4,2016,01,22
219,Very dated and noisy,"We had a late check in due to our late flight arrival at Dublin, but the front desk couldn't find our fully-paid reservation.  As a result, our family of 4 were placed in two rooms--one right above the restaurant on the first floor - no elevator access--and one far away down a long, awkward corridor to the ""renovated"" section, which was not much better than the older section.  Music was played through out the night past mid-night which was disruptive to our sleep.

Although the hotel claimed that they are newly renovated, it is still very dated overall and only partially updated, with peeling wallpaper, extremely old and worn-out carpet, and loose tiles in the bathroom. We also booked this hotel because their website advertised their early-hours airport shuttle (because we had an early flight) only to be told when we arrived that there was no shuttle and we would have to book a cab at a flat fee. Then when we booked the cab, the driver charged us by the meter rather than as a flat fee.

We also asked for a wake-up call on the morning of our flight and never received one. We're very glad we managed to wake up on time on our own.

Overall we had some negative experiences but we do want to emphasize that the hotel employees were polite and tried their best to be helpful despite the conditions of the hotel.",3,2016,01,21
219,Fab location.,"Me and my partner stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in January 2016. The people on reception were very friendly and extremely helpful. Our room was on the 6th floor and it was very large with very comfortable beds. The balcony was nice with a lovely view over Dublin. The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk to Temple Bar and a 5-10 minute walk to the main shopping area. The tram station is just across the road from the hotel with the bus station a bit further along the road. There was free WIFI and the TV in the room had English channels which was a great bonus! We had a premier king room which was very clean and the bed was huge and very comfortable. There was a safe in the room which was free of charge and slippers and a dressing gown left in the wardrobe for our use. There's a gym and sauna downstairs on the ground floor which can be used by all guests. The only downside was the smell of the corridors and the lift, and the speed of which the lift goes (very slow)!! Overall we found the hotel to be very warming, modern & in a great location and we would definitely stay again and recommend to friends/family.",4,2016,01,19
219,Chic and Central,"We were in the UK for a wedding in October and decided to spend some down time in Ireland after the hustle and bustle. We had read the reviews on this place so we decided to check it out. They had booked us into a room that had three beds. I'm a bit neurotic and two extra empty beds kind of freak me out so I had them move us to a smaller room with just one bed. The hotel might be a bit dated but it is still in good condition and most importantly it was clean and had a nice, contemporary feeling decor. The location can't be beat. We were within walking distance of all the major sites and the LRT lines were also very close by. We were also able to catch a bus from and to the airport that stopped quite close to the hotel. All very convenient.",4,2016,01,17
219,Highly Recommend ,"The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to O'Connell Street giving it a good location!

Hotel room was not massive but for ¬£24 a night cannot complain! Maid did room up everyday and left new toiletries.

The staff were very friendly and attentive.

The restaurant beside hotel is very good value! Two courses for ‚Ç¨20 and if you reserve a table beforehand at reception you get a free prosecco each! 

Lovely stay ",5,2016,01,17
219,Nice,"We spent 4 days last week in this hotel and the total result was quite good.

The hotel is perfect for business trips, in the city centre.

Rooms are very good, but not as good as we saw in the photos when we booked.

Maybe this is because we booked from a third party company and we were at the back of the hotel.

The food was very good and the breakfast as well. The restaurant next door was very minimalistic and quite expensive, but i have to admit that the food was very good as well.

Also the rooms were very clean and all the staff very friendly and helpful.

Recommended.",4,2016,01,17
219,Good base point.,"Decent hotel, fairly comfortable room (4 bed, family room), couple of little niggles like exposed wires in the rooms telephone cable, and the sauna & gym being closed for unforeseen circumstances is annoying (we stayed over a weekend: Friday 8/1/16 till Sunday 10/1/16, and at around 9pm 3 fire engines arrived at the hotel, we asked the night porter upon arrival back to the hotel, and he was sure not to let us know the reason, but the Gym & sauna was closed the following day...) Overall, fine hotel, good location with great local amenities; and it's good alternative with friends instead of a hostel.",4,2016,01,17
219,Lovely place ,"Really really nice hotel. The staff was great and the room was a new suit very nicely done the great location bar/restaurant on the side was amazing we will be definitely go back there in 2016 highly recommend

219,Great Hotel in a Good Location,"TIP - Upgrade to Premier Room - It is worth the extra few pound

Good Location. Easy access to shopping streets and public transport.
Clean hotel - has had some work done recently.
We have stayed here a few times & plan to return.

Downside from recent stay - they have closed the car park beside the hotel *nightmare* - but you can park at the train station car park for ¬£8 a day approx.

Wouldnt rate the hotels restaurant very well - not great - but nice to sit in and have a few drinks (good cocktail list).",5,2016,01,15
219,Breakfast before tours from Connolly Station,"We had several early morning tours booked from Connolly Station (almost across the street from the hotel). We arrived at 7:15am and let us none guest purchase the breakfast buffet. 

Highly recommend it! Just ask inform the front desk you wish to purchase breakfast they will tell you how to get the dinning hall! 

Was very nice to have a  lovely breakfast not just a ""tea & muffin"" at the station to begin our day!",5,2016,01,13
219,Great location,"Recently returned after a stay over New Year. A great location just 5 minutes from O'Connell Street, though the road up from hotel to the main areas of Dublin is a bit dubious. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, especially the breakfast room staff. The room was probably one of the nicest we have had, very modern, looked like the hotel has just had a refurbishment. Ate a New Years Eve meal in the hotels adjoining restaurant, again this was lovely, can recommend the steak!  Drinks were as dear as anywhere else in Dublin. We used the bus station which is a 2 minute walk away to go to the races at Fairyhouse on NY day, the concierge phoned to find out how often the buses ran, which was kind. The staff in the bus station were brilliant though and helped out with any queries we had. The buses in Dublin ran ten times more reliably than they do in West Yorkshire!! The Temples Bar area in town was heaving, but there are many great bars all over to choose from. Shocked a little by how many beggars are everywhere. Visit the Guiness Storehouse, surprisingly enjoyable. Downside to the trip, we were both poorly so in bed early on NYE which was a bit disappointing, especially when people were coming back to hotel after a great night and banging their doors. (Maybe would have been us if we weren't so I'll!) Definitely would use this hotel again.",4,2016,01,11
219,A show or a shopping day out this is a hotel for you!,"On a recent trip to a show in the 3 Arena we stayed in the Northstar hotel. The first thing that struck me was the  staff, they were welcoming, honest, polite and helpful. I had booked the room over the phone and the Shona on reservation could not be more pleasant or helpful, we stayed in a King premium room. The room was situated on the 5th floor to the side rear of the hotel, it was away from the busy main street so it was relatively quiet. The bed was huge and one of the most comfortable I have every slept in, there was tea and coffee making facilities  in the room along with a mini fridge and a safe which was at no extra charge.    We did not have time to try out the gym or the 7th floor facilities but maybe next time however we did try the  breakfast buffet  and it was excellent, I was very amused at the interest that two children had taken in watching the pancake maker make little pancakes. Over all we  enjoyed our stay at the NorthStar Hotel, it was clean, warm and inviting. The only one little downer for me personally and I stress me personally was the room was a little too warm for me, but other than that I would have no problems recommending a stay here.",5,2016,01,10
219,New Years Eve,"When checking in we got a free upgrade to a suite. Room was lovely, spacious and clean. Breakfast very good, nice room and friendly staff. Kettle, hairdryer and iron in room and it was cleaned everyday. Great location as was on the edge of main strip so close to everything but with no noise at night. Would definitely use again when staying in Dublin. ",5,2016,01,10
219,Great hotel,"I stayed here in June 2015 for 5 nights with my Fianc√©. The hotel is on a busy main road but we had a room towards the back so didn‚Äôt notice any noise. The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and clean and very well sized. It is a bit confusing with the layout of the hotel but you soon find your way around. We had dinner in the restaurant at the hotel most nights because it was cheap, delicious and opened late. There are also a lot of different places to eat around as well. I used the gym and was happy with the equipment. The location is great, you can walk anywhere from here, we walked to the Guinness Factory. There is a laundromat close by where you can drop off your washing for a wash and fold which was cheap and reasonable. I would definitely recommend staying here and think that it is great value for money. 
",4,2016,01,07
219,Very friendly service,"We were welcomed at reception by a very helpful young woman. We were upgraded to a premier room . The room was great. We had a meal in the restaurant where the spruce was good, the food well presented and tasty. 
After a visit to local theatre we ruptured to the bar and had a drink. The bar staff were friendly and the bar had a good atmosphere 
Breakfast in the morning was good again with friendly and helpful staff. 
A good experience and good value",5,2016,01,06
219,Weeks New Year Stay,"Great Hotel a very clean and comfortable room with access to 7th floor facilities. Excellent sauna and gym, conveniently situated in walking distance to city centre. Staff excellent very helpful and friendly nothing too much trouble",5,2016,01,04
219,Excellent stopover option,"Planning my trip home from Australia for Christmas I opted to stop over in Dublin with the hope of a good night's sleep after 20 hours in the air. I chose North Star partly because of it's location directly opposite Connolly Station, from where I could take a train home to Wicklow the following morning.

It was the perfect choice. After a short cab ride from the airport I was met by helpful and efficient staff and booked into a very comfortable room (an upgrade) with a wonderful view over Connolly Station. The room and hotel decor is smart and inviting, adding to the warm & welcoming atmosphere. There were several late-open stores and supermarkets nearby for me to pick up a few last minute provisions - and that done (sadly, I was too tired to visit the bar or try the food) I settled into a wonderful night's sleep and woke to the sound of Dublin's famous seagulls next morning!

The breakfast was more than adequate and the breakfast room staff were lovely.  I'm happy to say I left for Wicklow refreshed and full of the joys of the season! And I'm not kidding when I say I'm planning to make North Star a stop on all future journeys home!",5,2016,01,04
219,Nice hotel but let down by small things.,"We stayed at the North Star hotel for 3 nights over New Year. We arrived early and were able to check in to the room straight away which we really appreciated. We stayed in room 101 which was nice, but a few things let it down. 

The room smelt of damp which we reported to reception. We asked to change rooms but were told the hotel was fully booked and there was no where for us to move to. 

Our room was also really close to a train line which we weren't aware of when booking. The room shook when a train passed and kept waking us up. The train ran from about 6am until about 11pm. 

The shower in the room also had a mind of it's own. It took ages to warm up and when it did it was too hot, if you tried to turn the heat down, it creeped back up on it's own. The towels that are provided are rather small, but you can ask the hotel for more it you need them. 

Another small thing, the music downstairs (maybe the lobby) is switched on about 7am and you can hear this in the room. 

Apart from this the hotel is in a good location with a handy tram station just across the road.",3,2016,01,04
219,Great Hotel,"Just got back from a New Years break to Dublin and stayed at the North Star for 3 nights, I travelled with two friends and we stayed in a 3 bedded room which was lovely and clean and quite spacious. Tea and coffee facilitys, clean towels and toiletries daily, safty deposite box and even an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe. 
Everyone of the staff did their upmost best to make our stay pleasurable.I think the hotel has had a refurbishment as everywhere looked with clean lines and new carpets.",5,2016,01,03
219,New Years trip,"My boyfriend booked this as a surprise trip to Dublin for new year after neither of us had been before. On first opinion it was very good, we got into our room early, was large and comfortable (we had a premier club room on 7th floor) however we were directly next to the railway line which we soon found was quite busy and loud. It ran till late at night and from early morning. We asked for earplugs but there were none. We also tried to get into the premier club lounge quite a few times as its '24hours' and we got in once. It was locked the whole time so couldn't get the complimentary items as stated. We didn't watch the tv much but when we did it was poor quality and the picture didn't even fit on the screen, even after trying to change it. The bathroom is poor layout and I struggled to get in and out of shower as the toilet was right next to where you have to get in and as it was a bath, it was quite deep which isn't easy for someone quite short... Nearly fell out twice. Only a small thing but the beds are advertised in the more expensive rooms as having feather pillows and duvet, it had neither which was a shame. 
The breakfast was good and never too busy down there which was good. The staff were good most the time and the restaurant next door was good for drinks that we had. If our room had been on the other side away from trains it may have been better but unfortunately due to quite a few minor things and then that I feel it only warrants a 3 for the fact we paid for a more expensive room but seemed to get none of the benefits with the noise and lack of premier lounge etc.. Shame. ",3,2016,01,03
219,What a lovely hotel,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here over the new year and what a great hotel it is.

We arrived early on our first day and our room was not ready which really wasn't a problem as we had arrived before the check in time. We were willing to wait around but Ella on reception upgraded us to one of the premier rooms without us even asking. This got our stay off to a great start. She is a fantastic member of staff at the hotel.

I'm a head housekeeper in a hotel so I am usually one of those annoying guests that looks for issues with cleanliness etc but after trying my best I could not find fault with our room or any other area of the hotel. Very high standard of housekeeping clean towels and linen each day.

The restaurant and the staff are excellent. So friendly and helpful. I could eat here every day! Really high quality food. Great value for money. Lovely heated seating area outside too.

Me and my boyfriend loved Dublin and hope to return with friends in the future. We will definitely book to stay at the North Star Hotel again. This is a perfect example of what a hotel should be.",5,2016,01,01
219,Leaky Toilet For a Birthday Present!,"A leaky toilet on your birthday would normally lead to a bad review, but the after reporting a non flushing toilet which then began to leak the manager ( sorry I can't remember his name) personally came to try to fix the problem then provided a bottle of Prosecco, before moving us to a bigger better room with 2 complimentary cocktails and 2 free breakfasts! The breakfast was lovely and the rooms clean. The view wasn't anything to write home about but don't let that bother you.",4,2016,01,01
219,Sad introduction to Dublin,"Hotel  was booked by Aer Lingus and they should rethink this choice.
Hotel has no elevator on main floor; have to carry luggage up a
flight of stairs then down a long hall to elevator. No help was available
when we arrived after early AM flight with 2 seniors in family party.
View from our rooms was a heavy equipment operator a few feet 
from the window.
The noise from construction was unbearable. Think jack hammers.
Switched rooms but the noise was still unpleasant.

We had required 3 taxis for our group from the airport.
My driver went on at length about taking the bus lanes
to save time and money {D8820}. My ride cost 45 euro 
while everyone else paid 30 or 35.
Not the warmest welcome to Dublin.",1,2016,01,01
219,First time to Dublin,"Well, what a lovely hotel. Beautifully clean modern rooms, outstanding food and staff that can't do enough for you, especially Keith the bar manager.

219,"Joy,Whitby Uk","We stayed at this hotel en-route to Galway as ferry was delayed we did not arrive till after midnight,the staff were very helpful and understanding, as stayed in a premier room which was even better than expected, we booked for a night on our return from Galway and as we had to get up early next day to get ferry we missed breakfast so the wonderful staff on reception organised a packout for us which was delicious and really appreciated we are already booked for a

219,Quaint and Comfortable!,Have stayed here a few times and have always been satisfied.  The location is great for public transport. Breakfast is very tasty.  Decor pleasant!  Air con a big plus. Bed comfy and not too noisy so was able to get a good nights sleep.  Parking also available and onsite restaurant serves good quality food featuring lots of fish dishes! ,4,2015,12,30
219,Could be better! ,"Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel, with a comfy bed, nice ajoining bar/restaurant  and friendly staff.

Unfortunately we can only rate the hotel as average due to the fact that the room was constantly far too warm and therefore uncomfortable. We did ask reception if they could help us with the air con system however they never arrived to help. 

The breakfast was perfectly tasty and there was a wide variety of food to choose from. We did however have an issue on the first day.. We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated and then another 10 minutes for a clean plate! We recommend going to breakfast early-ish as we did on the second morning and experienced no problems. We must add that 2 hotel managers were present on the day with the problems and we're doing their utmost to ensure all guests were happy- we were very impressed with this. 

Finally.. We were very disappointed with the view from our room (metal bars and a dingy building) and it was slightly annoying that there was nowhere to hang coats or wet towels to dry out. 

A few improvements could be made but we cannot fault the hotel staff and the lobby area also is lovely. ",3,2015,12,30
219,Yearly Birthday trip,"We have visited this hotel every year for the last 6 years.  It is great value and the rooms are comfortable.  The staff are very attentive and cannot do enough for you.

We were checked in by the lovely Ella who seemed to be always genuinely happy and at ease with the general public while being extremely hard working, we even seen her helping out at breakfast next morning!  Room was really lovely with a spotless bathroom. Bar was lovely and seemed really busy with food orders and what was coming out to the tables looked really appetising. We had a lovely couple of drinks in a nice relaxed atmosphere in the bar with courteous, friendly bar staff and this hotel seems to be really accommodating to both families, groups and couples alike (as it should be)!

Bar was lovely and warm and v friendly staff - you can even see the kitchen area. We were seated by a v nice girl called Zooey who helped my mam to the smoking area. Great service by a guy called Keith who was very friendly and professional, he knew the menu and could answer all questions, he spent time with my Mam even tho the bar was busy. Great value for money as 2 steaks for 29 quid and they have different specials every day. Haven't been in there in years but will def return, def worth a visit",5,2015,12,23
219,Amazing,"My girlfriend and I stayed here the weekend before Christmas, and had the most pleasant of stays. Right from check-in to check-out, the staff were very helpful and friendly. 

We had a couple of slight issues. Our room was really warm, even with the temperature system set to very low, it was quite uncomfortable at times, but not anything worth making a fuss about. There were also some repair works ongoing during our stay which were inconvenient- but again not a huge problem as I'm still happy to give the hotel 5/5. 

We ordered room service two nights out of the three and received it within minutes. 

The best part about this hotel is its amazing location in Dublin, a short walk away from all the shopping, Temple Bar, and other attractive areas in the city. 

Family members of mine stayed here earlier this year and they were just as thrilled as I am with the hotel experience. 

I will make sure to recommend this hotel to as many people as possible because it can't be beaten! ",5,2015,12,22
219,Great service at the heart of Dublin,"For a weekend break at Dublin we booked the North Star Hotel. This based on earlier reviews and location close to Connolly Street. We arrived early but it was no problem to get our room already. The room we chose and I recommend all to do same = the Premium Room was really nice: very large incl bath and a small balcony. The services we encountered on all levels: reception, housekeeping, breakfast room was great and actually what every hotel should have as a standard! Last but not least the late check-out request was honoured with even the smallest problem. Overall excellent service and a place to use in the future & recommend to all Dublin visitors. Slight point of attention = the temperature on our room on the 6th floor was very warm and not easy to control without opening the terrace door day & night.",4,2015,12,21
219,Weekend,"Stayed here with my wife for the weekend. Would recommend this hotel and will be definitely staying again.  Looks great, rooms are nice, spacious and clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful too. Also the restaurant has great food. 
10/10 from us.",5,2015,12,15
219,Premium room,"We stayed here last weekend. Hotel is in a great location beside tram, Busaras, and across the road from Connolly Station. We had the premium room booked, and to be honest, we were a little disappointed with this. We had no balcony, and the bed was two singles pushed together, bed was comfortable all the same. Fridge in the room is a nice touch. We were told that the premium lounge was opened 24-hrs this was not the case, as we had to ring twice about it, and our key card wouldn't work to open the door. This room is a little disappointing too, facilities are poor here. During the night we were woken up by a fire alarm, with no explanation or apology on check out. Breakfast was good, buffet style. ",4,2015,12,15
219,Excellent service once again,"Travelled to the North Star this time by train ,hotel so handy to Station, i mentioned when booking that my wife had walking difficulties and requested a ground floor room if possible ,what a pleasant surprise awaited us when we arrived, we were allocated a room suitable for a disabled person, brilliant. My wife was a happy guest. Due to the bad weather we only got as far as the 3 Arena(?) which was at a very stormy location. Hotel organised transport for guests attending the Concert . Thanks once again for making this a memorable weekend.See you all again next year.",5,2015,12,15
219,Excellent hotel,"Just back from √† girly weekend in Dublin, we stayed in the Northstar this is our second time at this hotel and it is a great hotel very clean and comfortable with very friendly and efficient staff ,we ate in the restaurant and it was lovely,it is right beside Connolly  station and just a short walk to the main shopping areas, we would have no hesitation in booking this hotel in the future.",5,2015,12,15
219,"Great location, food and staff!","We work nearby and always try and go here for lunch. The food is delicious and the staff are really friendly. They're always great for the chats and eager to please. Great location aswell, right beside Connolly station and near the Bus Aras luas stop.  ",5,2015,12,14
219,Comfortable stay excellent breakfast,Couldn't  find fault with the North Star hotel great location great food and clean comfortable room also the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We ate in the hotels restaurant on the night of our stay and the food was excellent. Also the cooked breakfast was the best id had in a while. Great location across the road fro connolly station.  ,5,2015,12,14
219,Great hotel in a great location,"Second time staying in the North Star. Was very happy with my first stay and just as happy this time round again. 

Myself and a friend had booked for one night in a premier room. Both were very satisfied with the cleanliness of the room and the very comfortable beds plus having a balcony was very efficient. The location is also a stone throw away from busaras and Connolly station and is very handy to the city centre too. 

When checking in, we asked if it was possible to check out a little later than the states check out time of 11.30am as we wouldn't be getting to bed until the early hours of the morning and had a long drive ahead of us the next day. The duty manager Eva was very helpful with our request and allowed us to check out at 1pm completely free of charge. This is something that we both appreciated very much and we felt more prepared for the drive the next day because of this. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying here again in the foreseeable future. ",5,2015,12,11
219,Would definitely stay again :),"So I took my girlfriend away for a weekend in Dublin. I'm really glad I chose the North Star Hotel. The location is spot on and as it says in its description central to all the top attractions you would want to see. All the staff are very friendly, really helpful and easy to talk to. The rooms were very clean and tidy fresh towels and cleaned daily.
The bar and restaurant is very classy the food was amazing and again very good service. I'm glad to say I proposed to my girlfriend on this trip, all the managers and hotel staff went out of their way to make sure this was a very special accession for us so to you all we'd like to say a BIG THANKYOU. Would definitely recommend to anyone and would love to stay there again. :) :) :)",5,2015,12,10
219,Good location,Hotel is in a good location across the road from trains and busses or you can walk to the shops in around 10mins. Rooms were a good size and comfortable and breakfast was very nice. Staff were also pleasant and friendly. However the fire alarm being set off at 3.15am slightly ruined our stay! Took around 2.5 hours for the hotel to get it sorted resulting in a very disturbed nights sleep.,4,2015,12,09
219,Disregard for costumers,"Unfortunately the incident with the fire alarm spoiled completely what otherwise would have been an average experience. Based on that and because the sad incident with the fire alarm and the way the problem has been handled, I cannot say anything other than I am really disappointed with this place and wouldn't recommend to anyone. 

The fire alarm went off during the night around 9 times. I tried to keep myself calm as I recognize accidents can happen but after the alarm went off for the 4th time and after receiving several assurances earlier during the incident by hotel staff that the problem had been sorted I lost my patience. In the end we didn't manage to sleep until around 5 o'clock in the morning.

Next day the hotel offered a free breakfast and promised to keep in touch for further compensation or at least an explanation. Still waiting for this contact after more than a week but I assume it will never come. I guess they don't care as we had paid already. 

I am not sure how it works in Ireland but in UK the hotel would be committing an offence allowing guests to stay in their rooms with a faulty fire alarm.

To complete this bizarre experience there was a previous review with the title ‚ÄúPlease READ Regarding FIRE Alarm Reviews‚Äù that looks more a PR exercise them a real review. What a shame. Pathetic. Tripadvisor please investigate!!!

The hotel itself?

The pictures on website are a bit misleading showing a hotel that is much newer than it is in reality. There are a few previous reviews that agree on this point. 

The room was quite cold as the windows were not sealed properly and my girlfriend felt uncomfortable with that. Perhaps that was just my room. 

The double bed was a junction of single beds and as such quite uncomfortable. 

Positive?

Staff in the morning shift were very helpful however the ones on the night shift were completely lost. 

Also the location at least is good right by one of the Luas tram stations so not far from the main attractions.",1,2015,12,09
219,Return visit,"Our second year in a row to stay at the North Star hotel, we love the location, the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly, the great food and excellent value for money. Can't wait to rebook for next year üòÄ",5,2015,12,08
219,Raymond A.................Enjoyable Stay,"Excellent service and accommodation. Had a very comfortable and quiet nights sleep. Thanks for the Upgrade.
Good food in the restaurant and a excellent breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff. Convenient to train station and a short walk takes you to the main shopping area. We will return.",5,2015,12,08
219,Relaxing and beside city centre,"Staff, food , rooms great, stayed there a few times now and will go back. Bar food was fab, breakfast was a buffet and they had everything, sausage, rasher, pudding, egg, hashbrown, tomato, tiny tasty button mushrooms, fried bread, beans. Its only 3 min walk to bus station.",5,2015,12,08
219,Recommended!,"Helpful, friendly staff, good food, pleasant and spotless rooms in a central location.What more could anyone wish for?  Many attractions were within walking distance. We pre-bought a hop on/off bus ticket for all other journeys. An airport shuttle bus was also arranged to pick us up from the door, which  was a tremendous help. A good two day stay. Thoroughly recommended.
",4,2015,12,08
219,Dublin Stay,"I found the hotel very central to town and to the 3 arena.
We were upgraded when we arrived and were given complimentary chocolates and 24hr access to the lounge on the 7th floor with complimentary tea/coffee.
Rooms were very comfortable.  Staff were exceptionally nice.
Would stay there again and would recommend to friends also. ",5,2015,12,08

219,The staff were very helpful.,"My room was just amazing, the best I've ever stayed in. If you're a light sleeper the trains may be a problem but they weren't for me at all. I was only there 1 night. The staff at the front desk were so nice and helpful and the food was fairly good too.",5,2015,12,07
219,Fabulous as always ,"Stayed here at the weekend fabulous as always! As part of our annual trip to Dublin for Christmas shopping we love this hotel the location,the atmosphere,polite/friendly staff..couldn't praise this place more we really do consider it home from home the hotel has an amazing Cookhouse restaurant you'll find it hard to eat somewhere else after your visit to here! We stayed here again in October and that was equally as enjoyable and relaxing! We want to say thanks also to the girl Maria on reception for the Upgrade on arrival made our weekend!! Honestly we definitely  recommend this hotel to everyone! ",5,2015,12,07
219,"""Great weekend""","Great first impression, friendly reception ( thanks for recommendations Bobby), room perfect, location just across the road from train station ( ideal for us ). Tram around corner. Breakfast plenty of choice, smiley staff. We also were lucky enough to eat in the restaurant on the Friday, thanks for getting us a table John so glad we stayed. It was very busy with great atmosphere we were served by Keith great service all round. Our meal excellent compliments to the chefs.
We will be back after Christmas for the January sales :-)",5,2015,12,07
219,Great Hotel in a central location,"Highly recommend this Hotel when visiting Dublin so close to everything - Train, Bus and LUAS (Tram) stop. Reasonably priced with Hotel spotless, great Staff and Great food - Thanks to all for a brilliant weekend.",5,2015,12,07
219,Location Location,"We booked the North Star for the Simply Red Concert and some retail therapy. The Staff at the hotel reception where wonderful.
We made reservations in the hotel restaurant, again the service was great and the food was very reasonable priced and at a very high standard. We looked a various restaurants in the area and we found this to be the best one for service and value.
We will definitely be returning.",5,2015,12,07
219,Girls away,"The service was excellent from check in to check out. Everyone was friendly and professional. The room was a very acceptable standard just a little dated. We had booked through a third party which gave us excellent value for money, but it didn't effect the service in any way. The breakfast offered was very varied and a high standard, (including a do your own fresh pancake making machine-fab!). Very close to central Dublin- easy walk. 
Although not the hotels fault, during the second night other people in the hotel set off the fire alarm. This got annoying after the 5/6/7, I lose track! The staff were very apologetic. A shame that people think this is an acceptable way to behave, and compromise others safety. 
I would highly recommend the North Star for any travelling to Dublin.
      ",4,2015,12,06
219,Honeymoon,Had a fantastic time in Dublin.Hotel was clean and well equipped.Breakfast was not worth the 12.50 Euros.But apart from that and fire alarm going off on our 1st night it hasn't put us off and we hope to be back soon. ,4,2015,12,05
219,Excellent Hotel!!,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of November and I must say it was excellent in both location and service. We arrived at 9:30am on the Saturday morning and the hotel informed us that even tho we were early our room was already available, given that we had been travelling since 4am we were delighted with this service.
The room was lovely clean and comfortable, yes there were some issues with the fire alarm on the Saturday night but this was no fault of the hotel and the staff were quick to inform us that it was a false alarm and could not have been more apologetic the next day.
The location was around 15minutes walk from Temple bar and the train and tram station were right opposite so we couldn't have been in a better location if we had tried. The hotel staff were also extremely helpful with directions to locations and stops needed for the trams and busses. 
I would definitely recommend staying here, I will be booking again next time I visit Dublin",5,2015,12,04
219,40th Anniversary celebration,We visited this hotel on 2nd Dec. It is a spotless hotel with friendly and lovely food. HOWEVER on arrival the computers were down and we were told the view from our room would not be good. They weren't  kidding there was a building crew yards from our window drilling & hammering. We were told this would stop at 17.00.  We went to bed at 23.45 but we did not get to sleep as our neighbours had a party. I had to get out of bed & go down to reception at 12.45 to ask the noise be quietened but I had to go down again at 2.00am as it just got louder.  We were then woken at 8.00am with drilling & hammering. So much for our Anniversary celebration....Barbara,3,2015,12,03
219,Lovely stay ,"I have just spent three nights at the hotel with friends. My room was lovely, comfortable and quiet. We enjoyed dinner on two evenings and the food was very good. Staff were friendly and helpful. As I was travelling by train the convenience to Connolly Station was an added bonus. I would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2015,12,02
219,Excellent hotel would recommend ,"My friend and I stayed here for 2 nights. We arrived early Saturday morning and were told our rooms we already ready. Our room was excellent, very clean and everything we needed. Yes there was an issue with some idiot setting the fire alarm off however the staff did reassure us it was a false alarm. All the hotel staff were amazing, very friendly and efficient and nothing at all was too much trouble. It is about 15 mins walk to Temple bar area and a tram ride away from the Guinness Storehouse which is a brilliant experience. I would defiantly stay here again. Ten out of ten.",5,2015,12,01
219,5 star amazing thank you,"Just returned form a amazing weekend at this hotel we were attending a concert in the city with off course some early Xmas  shopping as a treat for my birthday girl  . From the moment we walked in it was fabulous beautifully decorated and a very friendly welcome .

Thank you all for a amazing trip see you soon

219,Great spot,"Came down for my stag and stayed in The North Star. The staff were exceptional given the fact that a group of 9 turned up looking like Johnny Vegas' drinking buddies, they couldn't do enough for us. The rooms were very good and the hotel bar was brilliant to get ready for the night ahead. Yes there were problems with the fire alarm going off throughout the night but given the fact that these things can happen the receptionist didn't deserve the angry mob the next morning. The receptionists handled the complaints  very well and even got involved in some banter with our group.....A+. All in all, I will be back in this hotel and would recommend it to others.",4,2015,11,30
219,Please READ Regarding FIRE Alarm Reviews,"I feel that the bad review because of the early morning fire alarm is unfair.  My wife and I were awakened early by a very loud fire alarm in our room on the 5th floor.  We dressed quickly and proceeded out in the hallway toward the stairs where we encountered a hotel staff member who informed us that it was a false alarm.   The very loud alarm persisted for a long time, however, so we went down the stairs to the lower floor lobby which is in a separate building connected by a corridor.   This part of the hotel was quiet (no alarms sounding). There were guests there waiting in no danger as they were within feet of the front door of the hotel.  

After returning to our room we were awakened by the fire alarm a second time and returned downstairs and this time we stopped the manager Claire and asked what was going on.  She informed us that someone had deliberately activated the fire alarm again and also discharged a fire extinguisher in the hallway.  She said that the glass plate covering the fire alarm switch was not only broken, but the switch itself was was also intentionally damaged so that the staff could not reset the alarm system themselves, so that we were forced to listen to the siren for quite awhile until the alarm company arrived
While we waited we were offered free drinks and the manager was very apologetic. 

REGARDING SAFETY- while we were evacuating we found ALL of the fire doors to have closed automatically, the lifts had returned to the ground floor, the stairwells to be clean and easily accessible.  There are also fire extinguishers located at several locations on each floor, near the lifts/stairwells, and at the ends of the hallways.  The long hallways not only have fire doors at their entrance from the main hallway on each floor, but have additional fire doors halfway down the hall.   These fire doors are normally open so that guests do not even notice them, but all of them closed automatically when the alarm sounded.   I consider the NorthStar Hotel to be VERY safe because I witnessed the safety system in operation myself.",5,2015,11,30
219,Sean the Barman,"Called into the Bar of this recently upgraded Hotel yesterday, on the way back to the Train and home. The Staff were so friendly I thought they knew us. I have to mention Sean behind the Bar. He was amazing. His service and manner were so impressive we have booked a Weekend away at this Hotel. Already looking forward to it.",5,2015,11,29
219,Very friendly staff and clean rooms! Issues with fire alarm....,"The room was great, the staff was great. I am giving it only 3 stars because of the fire alarm that went on for hours and hours during the night without an explanation or reassurance from the staff. Tough situation for them surely, but they could have handled it by alerting the guests that there was no actual fire/emergency. I did really appreciate the apology from the manager this morning during checkout, but that doesn't ease the pure panic I felt from 2am-6am. I'm glad that the across the hall neighbors could let the entire floor know there was no actual fire...but that message could have come from staff. ",3,2015,11,29
219,Do not stay here,5 am. Been in lobby for 2 hours. Fire alarm going off. No communication from any staff. Could have burnt alive and no one in this hotel could have cared less. Absolutely shocked. Please avoid staying here,1,2015,11,29
219,Beautiful Room - excellent service - ideal location,"We stayed here for one night and we were fortunate to get one of the new rooms on the 7th Floor, beautiful, large modern rooms. Over the years I have stayed here many times on business and I cannot fault them on anything, Beautiful breakfast and attentive staff",5,2015,11,26
219,Absolute Bliss. ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Had the pleasure of staying here for one night not so long ago & I was not disappointed. 

The staff were so lovely and made us feel right at home, always pleasant and ready to help with anything at all. 

Our room was gorgeous with a massive comfy bed, a flat screen TV and a clean up to date bathroom. The presentation of all was gorgeous. 

We had food and cocktails from the bar which were all top notch & delicious. Also, all at a reasonable enough price. The cocktails were my favourite - check out my picture (if it uploaded)! 

Overall, I love this hotel and would definitely return. üíó",5,2015,11,22
219,Convenient and homely,"We stayed in the North Star for one night while attending Graduation Ceremony in DCU.
We travelled to Dublin by train and arrived on a wet, dark, miserable evening. Hotel was very easy to get to, being literally across the street from Connolly Station. Check in was very quick, price of ‚Ç¨99 for room B&B was good. Breakfast was excellent...lots of choice.
Some kind of building development going on out the back but builders did not start til 8am.
Thermos with hot chocolate on table on landing was a lovely touch. Room was clean and cosy with all basic facilities. All staff were friendly. Our bag was stored til train time in evening which was also very welcome. I would definitely stay there again.

219,Its is centrally located and good for a night,"This is an old train hotel across the street from the station, they do not have parking and told me to put the car in a lot  down the road for 9 euros a night prepaid at the machine.  The hotel is older there were stains on all of the chairs in the hallway and the carpets showed signs of wear.  The room itself was standard fare.  The toilet was sanitized for my protection.  It was comfortable and clean and the shower in spite of its anemic water pressure was adequate. The staff was attentive and pleasant.  I was worried when we arrived because it seemed like there were a bunch of people there for a party or just to party.  But it was quiet.  Also couldn't hook up to the wifi.",3,2015,11,17
219,Great Hotel for Our Shopping Weekend,"Just back from this hotel and I can't complain.  It was opposite to Connolly Train Station so we didn't have far to trail our cases.  Beautiful reception with friendly, efficient staff, check in went smoothly.  We stayed in a classic twin on the fourth floor.  Lifts and hallways were clean and tidy.  Room didn't have much of a view, but we were there to shop so that didn't really matter to us.  The room was warm and had everything we needed. Beds very comfortable.  Buffet Breakfast was included in our price and was fantastic value for money.  The hotel, although a little out of the centre was fabulous for us as we didn't want the noise of some of the areas in Dublin but we were still well within walking distance or, in our case, was able to get the Luas pretty much back to within 100 metres of our hotel.  We ate in McGettigans on Sunday evening before heading home and had a lovely meal, the Roast Beef dinner, well worth the price paid.  We will be back to Dublin and we will make this the hotel of our choice for our next trip!  Well Done guys on a fab hotel! x",5,2015,11,16
219,Another great stay!,"Comfortable hotel, very hand for both the bus station and Connolly station. 5 minutes walk to O'Connell street and all that Dublin has to offer.
Some building work going on when we were there, but it did not bother us.
Will stay again.",4,2015,11,16
219,Midweek trip with family including young baby,"I am just back from staying at the North star hotel for the last two nights with my wife and our 5 month old baby daughter. Overall the experience was very positive. 
While I have never completed a review before I do travel a lot for business so am used to staying away quite a bit and so will complete with the review in order of events as they would have unfolded during my stay. 

The only downside to our stay was the car park location and the fact that there is no lift to the bedrooms due to some construction work being undertaken at present both of which added a little stress to the stay (initially at least). I was not aware prior to arrival that the hotel was undergoing some construction works and as a result I had to park across the road at Connelly station and with a few bags, buggy (including car seat and a few other attachments) and our baby it wasn't the easiest start to the trip. However once we arrived at the hotel the front desk team were really friendly and engaged in conversation about our baby straight away and told us if there was anything they could do for us they would, one of the members of staff on the front desk had a newborn baby herself and was exceptionally nice to us at both check in and check out (today).
In order to get to the bedrooms it required us to lift the buggy and luggage up a flight of stairs in order to access the lift to the bedrooms. However the help the hotel staff gave us throughout our stay was excellent and made this a lot less of an issue as there was always someone on hand to help from the front desk team, porter and even the barman in the restaurant / bar.

We stayed in one of the premier rooms and while it was a little The room was very clean (albeit a little tight once we put the travel cot in the room). 

Other than the initial part of our stay everything else was excellent. We had dinner on both nights in the hotel restaurant and both the food and service was excellent on both occasions. If anyone likes ribs, I would certainly recommend the rack of pork ribs although make sure you're hungry as the portion is very big. :)

I would like to give a special mention to two members or staff who certainly went out of their way to help in any way they could over the three days of our stay. The staff members were Keith in the bar/restaurant and the porter Mateusz (I hope I got his name correct). 

I would certainly stay here again and would even recommend this hotel to my work colleagues for trips to Dublin.",4,2015,11,12
219,Really nice lobby - rooms a let down,Location is pretty good - 15 minutes walk to anywhere we wanted to go but the room itself wasnt great maybe if we had asked for a room on a higher floor it would have been better. Was also quite noisy at night as you can hear doors closing all down the corridor,3,2015,11,10
219,Not a 4* resort.,"Arrived late on a Wednesday evening, check in was quick and easy, with relatively friendly staff. The hotel is well loacted, a mere 10 min walk across the river to the main area of the city.

Our room was on the 'first floor' which included going up a flight of stairt in order to get the lift down a level. The first thing we noticed on the 'first floor' was the heat. It was unbearable! As we entered our room, it was nothing particularly special, but seemed fairly clean & other than the ridiculous temperature of the room, there wasn't an immediate issue with it. 

Sadly the air conditioning was feeble and very loud - meaning our night's sleep was disturbed either by the noise or heat. The shower was pathetic - tiny shower head & not at all powerful. The following day it was clear that the cleaners had been in (the bed was made) however the room was not clean & the bathroom had not been touched. 

A hotel should be classed on it's worst rooms - assuming there are no worse rooms than the one we stayed in, it is a 3* at the very best. Such a shame after booking due to good reviews on here - perhaps we just got unlucky!",3,2015,11,10
219,Nicely Renovated Rooms and Helpful Staff,"When I arrived to the North Star I was not feeling well and hoping for a quick check-in and comfortable room. Check-in was quick, and a porter was available to help me get my bags to the room so I could get some much needed rest. The hotel itself is nicely appointed for any type of traveler, and located in a decent area of town. I had one of the renovated Premier Club rooms, with access to the Premier lounge. I didn‚Äôt have a chance to make it up to the lounge so I can‚Äôt speak to that part of the experience. Though my room had an underwhelming view of a construction pit, it‚Äôs a temporary fixture. My favorite part of the stay was having Mc Gettigan‚Äôs Cookhouse right downstairs. If I return to Dublin would not have a problem staying here again.",4,2015,11,09
219,Great location and not bad for a weekend stay,"had a family room - x2 small double and 1 single, beds were bit small but the room was a good size - shower wasnt amazing but it did us well for the weekend - wouldnt rate it a 4 star more like 3 star but it did the job and was clean!!",3,2015,11,09
219,Overall good experience,"Me and my friend stayed at North Star Hotel for 3 days in November. Great location (close to River Liffey for a long walk, just 5-8 minutes walk to Jervis Street Shopping Centre, Ilac Shopping Centre, various places to have breakfast/dinner in the town etc). 
The rooms are very standard / clean. The water pressure was not strong, however, we did not feel this was any issue. 
In addition, I had some issues with my sleeping due to the noise from the traffic and the WiFi connection was unstable.
The reception staff were friendly and we were well received! Also, the reception gave us very useful information regarding sightseeing, shopping, bus to the airport etc. I would recommend North Star hotel for a short / long trip holiday.",4,2015,11,09
219,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, great bar and restaurant. Rooms are very standard but clean, however water pressure in shower was awful. Apart from that, I would definitely recommend for the price. Very central and easy to navigate Dublin using this hotel as your base. ",4,2015,11,07
219,a good place to stay,"Staff were friendly and helpful, there's a great restaurant within the hotel. Most mornings there's a knowledgeable travel guide who will tell you about Dublin sights, give directions and provide maps. There's a standard Irish breakfast each morning with a variety of hot and cold items. Hotel is within decent walking distance to major city sights, Temple Bar, River LIffey.",4,2015,11,07
219,Gave me First Class Treatment,"My first day of arrival, my luggage was lost, I came in too early to check into a room.  The staff found me adapters for my laptop, put me up in the premier room for breakfast, and found me a room early.  I was a nervous wreck as I had a speech to do the next day, had no clothes or toiletries, and went out of their way to make me comfortable and were very calming.  The room are comfortable and clean.  And all the staff go out of their way to take care of you.  The only downside is there is major construction by the train station on the back side of the hotel.  Not their fault but it was very noisy with cranes, jack hammers, etc.  Not the hotel's fault and construction should be over soon.",5,2015,11,07
219,"Great location, great friendly hotel","A lovely friendly welcome from staff. Great location, used the 747 air link bus from the airport and stopped 50 yards from the hotel. Family room, spacious, clean, air con. View of DART from window but no noise.  Super breakfasts, staff very efficient and helpful.  Would stay here again.

219,Birthday Weekend ,"Before visiting I was in contact with Shonagh Byrne to organise some birthday surprises for my partner whilst we were visiting Dublin and she was nothing but helpful and easy to talk to. Whilst visiting Dublin our stay was perfect, check in was quick and easy. We stayed in room 768 and it was beautifully decorated and cool. We also had access to the premier lounge which was a nice touch. 
We had breakfast both mornings and both mornings it was lovely. Always hot which isn't always the case with buffet breakfasts. This hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Luas station that takes you to the temple bar area and o Connell street. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you like stylish decor and excellent service.",5,2015,11,05
219,A nice stay in Dublin and A nice Hotel,"This hotel is a nice hotel. It's a oldish hotel but with a face lift. The Rooms where very clean and room service every day. We stayed for three nights. The breakfast was ok, Buffet style not bad value for money. The hotel offer a bus back to Dublin airport, which is a really good service and it only five euros each. All in all a good stay and only about a 15 minute walk to the Centre of Dublin.",4,2015,11,04
219,Great Value,"Stayed here a few years ago and the place and staff were wonderful.  the room was clean and modern; not much of a view but this is a city hotel.  the food in the breakfast and the restaurant were fantastic, especially recommend the cocktails in McGettigans bar; where the bar man was friendly and helpful with recommendations.  It is close to bus station and train station but the streets around it are a little rough but the hotel was excellent.",5,2015,11,03
219,Not as good as it looks,"The reception was very stinky and the rooms were far from what you see in the pictures! The area is central but just outside a train station  so it's a bit dodgy compared to the rest of the city centre. Many rooms are also facing the railway which is not ideal! 
I would choose a better hotel if I had to come back! ",2,2015,11,01
219,A true Irish welcome,"Fabulous staff, delicious breakfast (pancake machine was a hit with all of the family), free hot chocolate and brilliant rooms with very comfy beds.  The hotel is directly accross from Connelly Station and around the corner from the Airport 747 arrival bus stop. It is 5 minutes walk to O'Connelly Street, the River Liffey and the tour bus stops. There is a Spar shop and fast food places nearby. There is a choice of restaurants in Temple Bar 10-15 minutes away and we would recommend 'Mexico to Rome' as it has delicious food and special deals. K",5,2015,11,01
219,great place to  stay,"I've just stayed here and it really helped make my weekend away enjoyable.  Staff are courteous, friendly  & efficient.  Check in/out were fast  and they keep your bags if you want to go out for the day. It's beside the train and bus station and 5 minutes from the main shopping area. There is free wifi, tv, hairdryer & iron in the clean & comfortable room. There is also a gym and sauna to use. The breakfast was fresh & plentyful and McGettigans restaurant is a must. There is noise from the trains but as it's beside the station you can't expect anything different!",4,2015,10,31
219,A great find,"Booked the North Star Hotel for a two night long weekend trip to Dublin.

I was taking my two teenage daughters and one of their friends so we asked for a quadruple room. This consisted of two singles and a double.

Check in was efficient and the staff very helpful.
Breakfast was amazing and all nicely presented.

Room was compact but more than adequate and it was spotless. The hotel is really convenient for central Dublin and transport links. The Airline Express bus stops just round the corner from the hotel. The main bus station and tram stop is also near.

My only negative comment as like several other reviews the hotel is like a furnace. The temperature in our room was just too warm. 

I would recommend this hotel. The street environment outside isn't so nice but the hotel and the staff are great.

I'm planning to come back in May 2016.",4,2015,10,31
219,Decent hotel choice for Dublin,"We were there mid October 7 nights for combined business and pleasure.  This hotel was perfectly acceptable, a good location and a fair value.  We stayed on the premier level floor seven and our premier king room is all we can review regarding the rooms. 
Reviewing the hotel in general, all employees we interacted with were friendly, professional and helpful.  It is a very old, but updated hotel, and it's layout was a bit quirky but fine. The optional full Irish breakfast downstairs was excellent and plenty for everyone to choose from.  The attached restaurant was very nice and the couple times we ate there, we enjoyed the food and the service.  There is construction going on right next door and the train actually goes over the center of the hotel.  So there was noise from those things, but since we weren't often in during the day, this didn't bother us.  But it is something to ask about when booking a room location.
Reviewing our room, the positives were:
Housekeeping did an excellent job during our stay.  The updated room was nicely decorated and modern and the bed was comfortable.  There was a large desk area, plenty of drawers and a large armoire.   
The bothersome things were:
Small size room but the hotel is old and it actually ended up not being too big of a problem for 2 people.  The bathroom was very small and the lighting was extremely dim, too dim to apply makeup.  Didn't really like having the hair dryer permanently plugged in, inside a drawer, under the coffee maker though it was in front of a mirror.  The cord was a bit short to easily work with since you had to pull it out of the drawer.
We had to get new keys twice because apparently your cell phone can disrupt the card.  
All said, we did enjoy our stay at North Star and we thought the price was pretty good for what we got. Location was nice and about a 10-15  minute walk to the convention center and also to Temple Bar area.  Management was always present and willing to help with any problems.",4,2015,10,30
219,"Return visit, not disappointed","Return visit to this excellent hotel. Have used it several times and we have always enjoyed the experience.. Staff friendly; service very good as is the food and bar.
Nice relaxed atmosphere, rooms well appointed - only downside is the noise from work being carried out on the railway but nothing that spoilt our stay. Will return again. Good base for the Dublin Marathon.",5,2015,10,29
219,marathon,"I stayed recently over the weekend witha group off friends doing the dublin marathon it was are first time staying in this hotel, wow its amazing form the moment you enter you feel its home away form home, we didnt eat in the restaurant becuse off are dietry needs but we regreated it after what a breakfast that was sereved the following morning, 
Also while leaving we all recived marathon packs which contained fruit, juice and a homemade granola bar complaints off the hotel which was a nice gesture 
we all will be returning when back in the capital 
keep but the amazing work",5,2015,10,27
219,nice hotel god location,"Great location 600 yards from train station,hop on the train went up Belfast to go to the Titanic exhibit! Lots of pubs close by. Hotel was clean and staff were very friendly. Try to get a room opposite from train tracks.
",5,2015,10,26
219,Birthday weekend 3 night stay,"We arrived early in the morning after an early flight to ask if we could leave our bags/check in for later, reception checked our booking we were told we could check in then, they asked why we were visiting & it was actually my birthday the manager was there at reception & we were given a room upgrade free of charge with the use of the lounge on the 7th floor for our room, my daughter's room remained the same on floor below. After putting our things away in our rooms (2) we went & had breakfast (we paid for this as an extra) on returning to our room there was a birthday card & a gift from the hotel - such a lovely unexpected touch. Both rooms were really good - very clean & fresh, tastefully decorated, & the beds were so comfy. The buffet breakfast was v.good & had a good selection, we ate this every day. We also ate in the bar/restaurant 1 night & the food was excellent. We had drinks in the bar before going out for the evening & also when we returned, the drinks were reasonably priced & there was a good selection available + cocktails too. All the staff were really lovely, pleasant & so helpful. The reception staff even helped us book in for our return flight check in. On our departure day after we checked out we were able to leave our bags at the hotel & collect them before going to the airport later. Thank you for such brilliant service. We would definitely use this hotel again. ",5,2015,10,26
219,Great spot to meet friends in the city,"I've been here a number of times with friends for lunch, dinner and post work drinks.  The service is fantastic, price is really reasonable and staff are really friendly.  I'd make particular note about a real charater in the hotel 'Keith', who provides service with a smile and goes above and beyond. Gill",5,2015,10,23
219,Staff,"I have not in this hotel for a couple of years. I was amazed by the transformation. It is so elegant and classy. Food is fabulous I go there now as much as I can for lunch, as I work in the IFSC. The Staff are extremely friendly especially Keith such a character and very handsome if I do say so myself lol.",5,2015,10,21
219,1st anniversary luxury,"We spent almost a week here in a premier room for our anniversary and loved the place. We arrived tired from our early flight and were delighted to find we could check in early to our room, so our stay started off with a real positive! From there it just got better, a clean comfortable room with bright stylish decor, friendly staff, and an excellent bar/restaurant, plus the use of an exclusive 'executive lounge' with views of the city a real bonus! Our room was a tad on the small side, but we were on a corner and only used it to sleep/get changed, etc. Also the room did get awfully hot really quickly as the air con was broken, but to be fair we didn't report it so can't complain really!! 
We will definitely be back!!",5,2015,10,20
219,Great Stay,"We had a wonderful stay in Dublin.  This hotel is great, easy access to the 3 arena for the gig.  Our room was modern and spotless and the bar area was lively and beautifully designed.  Staff were great, Keith the bar man looked after us wonderfully.  The bar food from the cookhouse was lovely and the craft beers were delicious. One fault - no smoking area.  We would definitely recommend this Hotel for visits to Dublin.",5,2015,10,19
219,Regular Guesr,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times on business as it is within walking distance of my companies Dublin office and in a good location for other parts of Dublin including the City Centre.

The first time I stayed the rates were excellent at only ¬£68 a night and I was surprised to enjoy a pretty good stay. The public areas of the hotel are a bit dated and in need of a refurbishment but the room I was allocated was just fine and for the rate was good. I have however stayed several times since my first stay and the room rates have been getting higher and higher and last time I was booking the rate was over ¬£150 a night!

I am unlikely to stay at this hotel again not just because the rates have increased so much but there is a lot of to noise from Connolly Station if your room is facing the main road. I have complained about noise on seve3ral occasions and even though I was upgraded to a suit last time I stayed this room was still facing the station just on a higher floor so noise was still an issue.",3,2015,10,18
219,"Great hotel, service was mediocre","We really liked our room on the 7th floor--the king bed was very comfortable, two TVs in the room, bathroom was very nice with a large tub, and we had a small balcony.  We also had access to the executive lounge, which had drinks and snacks available in the evening, and a continental breakfast in the morning.  I didn't have a chance to use the sauna, but I give them points for having one; I heart saunas.

The service/management, overall, was not fantastic.  Several conversations we had at the front desk were very unclear because the staff members didn't have great English.  When we arrived we found out that the water would be off from 10 AM until 4 PM the next day, but it ended up remaining off until 7 PM.  One of the things they advertise is babysitting service, but when my wife spoke to someone at the front desk about it, they had no idea what she was talking about.  She eventually found a manager who was able to arrange a babysitter for one of the evenings of our stay, and that was all fine except we were told they charge for it would be added to our bill, but then the babysitter herself was expecting that we would pay her.  We worked it out, but it was awkward.",3,2015,10,17
219,weekend,"Nice warm welcome on arrival at reception as been a few years since here a number of changes reception move to ground floor as before up the stairs
 Our room was at the rear of hotel a bit newer nice room comfy. bathroom ok   good nights sleep only problem early morning bin collection.
Breakfast in the basement was  very good variety full irish  or continental available tea/coffee/juice etc,
Nice hotel with friendly staff",5,2015,10,16
219,staff,"Myself and my friend go here every week for our lunch.The food is delicious  and the staff are so nice and friendly .. Keith the barman always looks after us, very polite and so attentive .. Its always a pleasure going there . Highly recommended ..",5,2015,10,16
219,Not impressed.,"Stayed here in mid September for a weekend visit. The hotel first impressions aren't bad, it's nice inside and the reception team are good. The room we were given seemed alright and was at the back of the hotel, the room itself was fine, unfortunately the orange colour was very appropriate as it felt like we were inside a furnace as the air con wasn't working. When the staff eventually turned up to look at the problem they admitted they had previously replaced the aircon units as they had been noisy. However they seemed to have put units in that don't bother working instead. We were given a fan rather than offered a room change, which was initially mentioned. If it had worked or been dealt with better then it would have got a 4. ",3,2015,10,16
219,We just went in for breakfast and it was quite good,We were a group of 8 siblings going to Dublin to have som fun. We stayed at a private flat with no breakfast available. So on the second day we went hunting for som quality breakfast - and we found it at this hotel. We just came in from the street and bought breakfast tickets at the reception. It was a bargain. Great price for at lot of different breakfast menus. A perfect option if you are staying in Dublin a need a place to have breakfast. ,5,2015,10,14
219,Mrs Tracey  mcgrorty ,"Beautiful rooms with complimentary robes and slippers.  Access to the private lounge with complimentary tea coffee and water.  All the staff were lovely and helpful.  Had dinner on the Saturday and the service was excellent and the food was great and good value. They even provided balloons on the  table for the birthday girl.
The location was perfect and all transport was on your doorstep.  I will definatly book again.
Huge thanks to all the staff for everything ",5,2015,10,14
219,Great Hotel for a Family Stay in the City,"Our family of four stayed at the North Star recently for a family trip to the Capital.  The hotel was easily accessed by car and is situated perfectly for walking to the city centre -or for the buses, trains and Luas.  We had dinner on one of the nights in the hotel's ""McGettigan's Cookhouse"" and it was fantastic (had the best chicken wings we ever had).  Everyone was happy with their meal, and great value too. The family room was spacious enough for us as we weren't planning on spending much time in the hotel.  The room facilities were adequate and met our needs during our stay.  The bathroom was clean but could be doing with some attention e.g. lock not working; shower running hot and cold; hazardously steep stepping from the bath out to the floor. Window was facing the train tracks, which we were apprehensive about, but it turned out not to be a problem - we all slept soundly.  The free wifi was available in the rooms, and the connection was fast. Breakfast was tasty, with a great selection for all of us. Nice that we could eat up until 11am (weekend time). Staff were friendly, and the atmosphere in the place was nice. The only disappointment for me was that there were no parking facilities, (although I acknowledge that there are improvement works underway) which meant us having to source alternative parking late in the evening - quite daunting when you're not familiar with the area and not enough change, then credit card issues in an unsupervised carpark. If I had known in advance about the parking situation, I may have chosen an alternative hotel. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good hotel, with good food, in a convenient city centre location.",4,2015,10,09
219,3.5 rating if I could,"The hotel is not bad at all. It is a bit of a struggle to pick up your bags a few stairs to get to your room, but the hotel itself has a B&B feel to it. We actually stayed here twice with a tour company--1 night in a standard room with two beds which I liked better than the 2 nights in the ""suite""--which hds a handicapped bathroom/accessible room. The bathroom grossed me out because I felt like I was in a rest stop. The walls were small and gray tile covered the walls and the shower covered the whole bathroom with terrible water pressure. However, the beds were comfortable and comforters were great. I also enjoyed the breakfast they offered. Overall the hotel is quaint but could use a little help to spruce up the walls a little bit.",3,2015,10,09
219,First trip to Dublin,"The hotel is opposite the railway station, and so the area can get busy but the staff and room easily made up for it. 
The reception staff were attentive and helpful with advice and directions.
Breakfast was amazing, especially the pancake machine! Food was tasty and plentiful.
Will book again",5,2015,10,09
219,Very acceptable hotel for a biz trip,"I stayed at this hotel during a conference at the CCD Dublin. A good location about a 15 minute walk from CCD and the hotel has good links with both taxi rank and tram station outside.  The room was fine, basic with good shower and bath.  Curiously a train line runs over the top of the front part of the hotel but I was not bothered by any noise. Breakfast was buffet, nice and quick with a good selection.",4,2015,10,07
219,Amazing hotel!,We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights over August bank holiday. It's such a gorgeous hotel and so pretty! Free wifi throughout. Very close to the bus station and about a 15 min walk to temple bar. Our room was lovely with a very very nice bathroom. Can't wait to stay again!,5,2015,10,07
219,Nice hotel,"The hotel is really nice and the rooms are modern and beautiful. The only bad thing is the location. It's in a sketchy area and also, right outside our window they are demolishing the building next door and it's really loud. I would make sure your room is no where near that. Otherwise, the hotel is beautiful and the pub on the first floor was great. ",4,2015,10,06
219,Suzanne & Steph repeat visits over & over again . ,"Well I have been to this hotel at least 10 times over the last 4/5 years and can honestly say it is simply the best . I feel safe here with all the lovely staff and nothing is ever too much trouble for them . Maria on reception is a total gem in every way possible and the management are very lucky to have her . She always greets with a lovely smile and welcome. The hotel  bar staff Shaun, Keith & John are totally amazing in their job in the restaurant & bar area. Clare who is in charge of nearly everything is like the hotels MUM & nothing is too much trouble for her and she is a lovely lady . The cleaners are totally trust worthy and I've left my personal belongings and money in my room and never had any trouble , the cleaners are always polite and happy to help in any way. Kieran the concierge is absolutely a gentleman .. & can arrange any trips/ outings you need & I can't recommend this hotel enough to family's , elderly , young people. YOU must have the hotel breakfast as it is amazing . The hotel has had a revamp over the last 4/5 years I've been going and is totally amazing in every way . They are building 70 new rooms at the moment and not once did this effect our stay . Room service is available and always prompt . It is located across from the train station and is within walking distance to anywhere of interest . Rooms have hairdryers, irons & ironing boards & toiletries . I love room 203 & request on booking as its at front of older part of hotel and never noisy even though it's on main road stretch . Air con is in the rooms too . Beds are soooooooo comfortable you don't want to leave them . Towels are changed daily and are luxury thickness and brilliant white . The hotel has lifts/ stairs so caters for everyone . 
All in all a totally amazing and helpful, caring hotel . Well done yet again to you all at North Star . 
Will hopefully see you all in December .

219,First stop for Dublin Weekend break!,"This is my 3rd time staying at the North Star and was happy to get great reports back from my friends who were also visiting from the UK.  Rooms were sparkling clean and had everything anyone needed.  Central to all the hot spots in town, staff were great in recommending places to go.  Their own restaurant in the bar had a lovely range of food.  Keith in the bar was brilliant at making sure we got our regular table and ensuring we all had a great time for the whole duration of the stay.  

See you next year and thanks to all the staff especially Keith for fab trip!",5,2015,10,05
219,Centrally Located,"CIE Tours booked us here for two night on September 15-16, 2015 and is located in the city center.  Room was nice and had A/C. There are train tracks that run between the front of the hotel and hotel room tower in the back.  The trains run until 11:00 PM, but they were not noisy enough to keep up awake.  Bed was very comfortable. We ate at McGettigans Cookhouse & Bar located in the hotel.  It was fabulous food and great service. Breakfast buffet was typical Europe breakfast.  ",4,2015,10,03
219,Not the best experience,"My husband and I stayed there for a weekend recently and will probably not return. The staff was very friendly and welcome. The lobby looks absolutely fabulous but the rooms didn't live up to that decor. They were plain, clean - nothing to complain or rave about. However, we were not lucky with the room itself. It faced the street, 1 st floor and therefore, it was incredibly noisy. In addition, the radiators were on full blast and it felt like a sauna in there (I think the outside temps during the day were 15 - 18 degrees). We didn't sleep well at all and were grumpy all day. For the second night we asked whether the radiators could be turned out - and they were but it was still somewhat too warm - opening the windows wasn't an option since the traffic from the street and train station was too much too handle. 

We also ate in the restaurant which had been recommended by friends. Again, lovely decor and atmosphere but the food wasn't particularly great. Also, the acoustics in the restaurant were anything but acceptable. While there were probably about 20 diners in there (it was busy but not crowded) I could not understand the waitress or my husband albeit being next to me and across from me.",3,2015,10,02
219,"Great location, welcoming staff",We loved this place. We arrived at 1:00pm and were able to go right to our room. The concierge advised us about nearby restaurants and places to see. We ate lunch in their restaurant and the food was delicious. It was a quick walk to O'Connell Street and other points of interest. Connolly Station was right outside our window but we were not disturbed by any noise. The breakfast was more expensive than we expected--and the location of the breakfast area was just weird--so we went elsewhere and found great food just around the corner for less than half the price.,4,2015,10,01
219,Good hotel conveniently located,"Was given a very quiet room in the back of the hotel. Room was excellent, bed very comfortable. Area where the hotel is situated a bit edgy, but only a short walk to more touristy spots. Friendly staff.",4,2015,10,01
219,Good 3 / 4 Star hotel to stay for work,"For a 3/4 Star hotel, the rooms were clean and modern. The wifi was good. The bathrooms was ok but had a weird odour. The location is a 5 - 10 min walk to the IFSC or 15 min to 25 min walk to the tourist area. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. There is a lounge for guest staying in the Premier Rooms, this was very basic and nothing special.",3,2015,10,01
219,lovely stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly. 
A couple of people in the reviews are saying that the train was noisy, we were positioned directly opposite the train and didn't have any problems. We could hear the train but it wasn't loud enough to wake you up.
The hotel is in a really good location, just a 10 minute walk into the center, it's surrounded by cheaper shops too which we visited a lot. 
We thought it was really good value for money considering how close it was to city center.
The shuttle bus service to and from the airport was also really good and very cheap. 
I would definitely return to this hotel if I ever went back to Dublin.
The only thing I would complain about is the WIFI, it kept cutting out.",4,2015,09,30
219,A very pleasant older property of character.,"Situated opposite Connolly Station and very convenient for the LUAS (tram) stop at Busaras the North Star provides a good standard of accommodation near the city centre. The room has been refurbished to a high standard and tastefully decorated. All the facilities that you would expect are present together with a comfortable bed and an en-suite bathroom. We didn't sample other meals but the breakfast, which is a buffet-style serve yourself, was very good. Having a room overlooking the street there was a certain amount of traffic noise but the double glazing coped with that pretty well. The wi-fi was reasonably quick, and free.",4,2015,09,29
219,"Great location,a bit tired in places","Stayed for 3 nights with friends. Perfect choice as the hotel is in a great location for most of the city sights. Very helpful and friendly reception. Rooms were spotlessly clean with a nice bathroom but as we were on the first floor at the front it was a bit noisy all night and the overhead railway was a bit annoying. Excellent bar and restaurant with great staff. Breakfast is really good value but  you have to pay extra for it. Corridor on first floor starting to look a bit drab, but this should not put you off as this is a great centrally located hotel. A 20min walk takes you to o,Connell street and another 10 mins to temple bar. 20 euros from airport to hotel by taxi and plentiful. 
We plan to go back to the hotel in the spring.",4,2015,09,28
219,Perfect visit with friends!!,"Really fab hotel with great friendly staff loved the room and full Irish breakfast is a must quality food, decor superb all clean and fresh had a fabulous time in Dublin at temple bar will return only reason have not rated it a five was the heating all the hotel is red hot corridors the lot, overall great hotel though ",4,2015,09,28
219,Lovely Hotel,"Everything was fine and the hotel is so close to all amenities.  My only grumble would be that the bar area was not so comfortable with having half of it as a dining room.  Also there is a staircase to go up before you get to the lift.  This might be a problem for people with disabilities or heavy suitcases.
      
      
      ",4,2015,09,28
219,Perfect,Does what it says on the tin! Clean rooms and bathrooms and decent size! Bed was comfortable I slept well apart from people slamming doors as they came but that to be expected ! Good facilities tea coffe and hairdryer! Nice decor in corridors ! Good reception staff very helpful booked us tickets for a fottie show. Location was great good transport links and easy 8-10 min walk to the centre !,4,2015,09,27
219,Nice room with a tall shower in a smallish bathroom,"Clean, new room with a king bed and enough space. Bathroom was smaller which wasn't a problem. Shower height was great since I didn't have to bend down for it. It probably could fit someone 6'5"". Easy walk down Talbot Street to O'Connell Street. ",4,2015,09,25
219,A little gem in the city,"Although the location is not glamorous, this hotel is delightful. The staff are attentive, the rooms are spacious for a city hotel, the decor is attractive, the space is clean and well-maintained, the restaurant has a great locally sourced menu with flavorful food, and the cost is very affordable. The only negative was the fitness center- it's cramped and poorly ventilated.  ",5,2015,09,25
219,Extremely disappointing,Would never stay there again.  Paid for premium room which did not look like photos on site.  There is a commuter train that runs over the hotel from 5:30 am to 11:00 pm.  Noise made sleeping impossible.  We were to have continental breakfast in premier lounge every morning.  First morning we could only find four boxes of cereal in a cabinet and 1/2 liter of milk.  Only one day out of five was there enough food to eat when we arrived.  Bathroom was too small and not enough light to see yourself in mirror.  Had to carry luggage up one floor before you get to the elevator.  Would have moved but could not get another reservation in our price range.  Must say the pub and restaurant were the only bright spots.,1,2015,09,25
219,Nice hotel in a bad area,"We stayed here on our bus tour of Dublin.   Very nice but in a poor section of the city.   Rooms are spacious, clean and fairly well lit.  Lots of electric outlets too.  It is showing signs of wear--- grout in bath empty in spots.  Restaurant & breakfast were great!! Nice atmosphere!!!!",3,2015,09,23
219,4star bed but 1 star bathroom...,"This is classed as a 4 star hotel...sorry but it's not. The bathroom and rooms which have been tarted up in an overall renovation whilst clean are dated and probably waiting to be renovated in full, a new sink with an updated splash back do not make this 4 star. The bath/shower had distinct mould in the corners (room467). Very Ordinary. However the quality mattress and  pillow were brilliant, definitely 4star!, The staff in the restaurant were friendly and the service was excellent, they could not have been more helpful,Deirdre and David in particular were just lovely and the food was really good. Would i stay here again, not sure...",3,2015,09,22
219,Great Location!!!,"Arrived in Dublin and stayed 2 nights at the North Star Hotel.  When booking your room make sure to ask for the upgrade to get the better room and breakfast. We made that mistake and I asked if we could upgrade but they were completely booked.  I called the hotel a few weeks before we left to check in early since we arrived at 6AM and they said ""we are booked and we are sorry but check-in is in the afternoon"". The staff was more than accommodating since we arrived 7 hours early and asked if we could check in early (once again we tried) and they did!! We were thrilled after a 24 hour day of travel! The location is ideal if you want to see Dublin. Almost everything is in walking distance and if it isn't the hotel is right across the street from the rail, take the ""red line"" it was VERY convenient, only 30 second walk and takes you all over Dublin! 

We also ate at the hotel restaurant and it was very tasty! I had the seafood special which was a pasta dish and mussels, incredible! It was quiet being in the city and quaint, which we enjoyed. 

We would of stayed here at the end of our trip for the last 3 days but it was booked and now we know why. I will stay here again if I'm in Dublin. Wonderful! Thank you to the staff for letting us check in early, you have no idea how happy you made us!",4,2015,09,21
219,Great staff,"We spent two nights here in early September. I will begin by saying we received exceptional assistance from the front desk clerk, I wish I could remember her name! There is no parking at the hotel (which I realize I should have checked on before arriving).  We arrived later in the evening from Killarney for the last two nights of our trip.  Did not feel comfortable leaving the rental car on the street for the night, so ended up taking it back late at night. 
Our room was nicely decorated, but directly on the street and EXTREMELY loud from all of the cars, buses and trains.  There is also no air conditioning which made for a very stuffy room. We ended up cracking the windows and sleeping with headphones on to drown out the noise. 
Breakfast was ok. Service was fast and had typical continental food.  I will say that we were slightly uncomfortable walking back from to the hotel from dinner in the evening.  Walking past the bus station and side streets you encounter lots of people loitering.  
I would try another hotel if visiting Dublin again.  ",3,2015,09,19
219,Great Dublin Hotel,"We stayed here two nights, in a triple room, which was one queen bed and two twins. There is a full bathtub and plenty of products in the bathroom, as well as a surplus of towels. The beds were quite comfortable. The hotel is right across the street from the train station which made it very convenient. Also, the AirLink bus from the airport dropped us off right around the corner from this hotel. We could hear and see the train from our room, but it didn't bother us. 

Talbot street is right around the corner and we walked to restaurants and the supermarket easily. ",4,2015,09,18
219,Amazing Hotel & Experience,"After my partner surprised me with a visit to Dublin I was dreading arriving at the hotel he had booked... Well, I couldn't of been more wrong! 

The North Star was fantabulous, the entrance and lobby were well decorated with lovely furniture and the staff greeted us with the warmest of welcomes.. We was given our room and they kindly upgraded to us a suite... WOW... I didn't want to leave, the suite was light, spacious, well designed and with complimentary robes... winner (hehe)!!

We decided to eat in the ajoining restaurant and we weren't disappointed, the service was exceptional the staff do enough for us.. The food was of the highest of quality and utterly delicious.

Wouldn't hesitate on staying here again.. Thank you :)",5,2015,09,18
219,Shining Hotel,Best night sleep our whole trip.  The staff was very accommodating of our early leave next morning and brought us a bite before normal breakfast hours.  They even printed our boarding passes.  Beautiful building and enjoyed having a balcony.,4,2015,09,15
219,Impeccaple service.,"We were a family of 4 that staid 3 nights at the hotel in August. The location is very nice when you arrive late in the evening, they are just across the main train station. From the moment we walked in the service was perfect. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is about 15-20 min walk from the main down town area, but we loved the walk so much to see on the way. We went on a 2 day tour of the west coast and had to storage our luggage. When we asked if we could do so at the train station the hotel offered to storage them for the two days free of charge. The rooms were a perfect size and had nice soft beds. The Irish breakfast at the hotel is really good and keeps you full for the bigger part of the day. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin.",5,2015,09,14
219,Overnight stay,My wife and I had the pleasure of staying in this centrally located (5-10 minute walk to oconnell street )hotel on an overnight stay prior to flying to Italy.The hotel is directly across the street from Connolly station so ideal for train and bus connections though you are not aware of any noise disruptions and the hotel provides a shuttle service to the airport for a modest 5 euro per person.The bar/restaurant provides a well laid out comfortable area in which to enjoy a wide range and tasty menu moderately priced and the staff are friendly and informative from reception to bar to waiter/ess service.rooms are well equipped and clean and comfortable. All in all top marks North Star ,5,2015,09,11
219,Gonna give it a five due to fantastic overhaul,"I was in the bar here for a work function. Honestly when I got the invite I was a bit worried. Pass this place regularly and was in it years ago so expectations were low. 

From the moment I stepped over the threshold it was a WOW !!! 

The decor is really fab. The outdoor area is amazing. Everyone there was suitably impressed. 

Finger food was gorgeous - huge compliments to the chef I Loved the smoked salmon presentation and the salad in the lettuce leaves. Mini burgers yum . 

They have screens over the bar which show deals for every day. Eg Wednesday was 2 cocktails for the price of 1. 

Will go back here. The youngsters in our group all said they would love to host a party there. A hidden gem it was generally described as üòÄ",5,2015,09,10
219,Perfect Hotel. ,"Felt like we had walked into a 5 star hotel when we checked in. It's very lavish & posh. Great service & facilities, including wifi. 
Within walking distance of the main shopping area in Dublin & about a 20 minute walk away from the Temple Bar Area. 
Great hotel in a great location for tourists. Families may prefer to go closer to the centre to save walking. ",4,2015,09,10
219,Very disappointing ,"Car park is more like a yard @the back which they insist on holding onto your car keys & take the liberty of moving your car without consent & charge you ‚Ç¨8 per night for the inconvenience.
The hotel is no more than a 2‚òÜ‚òÜ & extremely noisy at the front rooms. Pictures are very misleading!!!!!!",1,2015,09,08
219,Not impressed,Front rooms had to contend with noise from cars out front and a dart train at the back which rattled the windows each time it passed. Needs serious updating to become a 4 star. Carparking not great for the prices charged.,2,2015,09,08
219,Good Experience ,"We stayed at the North Star Hotel for 4 nights in late August. The hotel provided us with an apartment - very nice and had the added benefit of two separate bedrooms (very helpful with little children). 

Although the hotel is close to Connolly station rest assured the train activity is hardly audible. On the other hand 'internal noise' from the wooden flooring in some of the corridors can be disturbing to some.

Breakfast is served in the basement and can be crowded at times. Food is decent although it never varies and one big area of improvement would be to serve an expresso or cappuccino instead of the standard bland coffee.

We dined three times at McGettigans at the hotel and found the food and service to be very good. 

All in all it was a good experience and I would certainly return again when visiting Dublin.",4,2015,09,06
219,Nice Older Hotel,We stayed 2 nights at this hotel and were very pleased. It is older but the beds are comfortable and the staff were very helpful. It is conveniently located across from the Connelly train station and is an easy walk to the O'Connell street which is a walking/shopping street. The only small negative is that you must go up 5 or 6 steps to get to the elevator. However there are bellmen if you want help with your luggage.,4,2015,09,05
219,Centrall located Hotel,"Service and staff top, breakfast great, bar and restaurant were staff and food are super. Room dependent off What you get. We changed without any problems. Ask the staff for placer to see or Eat allways helpfull.",4,2015,09,03
219,Fab hotel! ,"We stayed here for 3 nights, and got upgraded on arrival, access to the premier suite, room was excellent, reasonably priced, staff went out of there way to make it a great trip, Keith from the bar was amazing really looked after, food was lovely, we celebrated our anniversary here and staff make it feel extra special (Keith again) üëçüèΩ would most defiantly return üòä",5,2015,09,01
219,"Great location, okay hotel....","The location of this hotel is outstanding....right across the street from Connelly Train station, where you can catch the train or luas light rail.  Its also within a block of the bus station.  You can walk anywhere!  The staff was wonderful.  The hotel room was ok, but I didn't think it warranted a 4-star rating.  Compared to the other hotels we stayed in during our Ireland travels, I found the North Star to be more like a 3-star hotel.  Although I wouldn't avoid the North Star, I will likely try other hotels on our next trip.",3,2015,09,01
219,Brilliant,"Just returned from a 5 nite stay, could not fault the hotel whats so ever,  location was fab right across from connelly station. Temple bar a 10 min walk away, shopping was turn left at hotel exit and straight along the road 10 mins to all the shops! All staff were helpful and really made our stay. Breakfast omg fantastic really brill sets you up for the day! Tea and coffee refilled everyday in the room, the hotel bar was very nice especially the beer garden. Only drawback i would say is main restaurant was la carte and some dishes were really small,, apart from that no negatives ",5,2015,08,31
219,"Fab hotel, lovely room great food!","We are here at the moment and are in a fab room on floor 7. This is a premier room and really great. Bed is amazingly comfortable, furnishings and decor lovely. The is a fridge in the room along with a digital safe, ample storage and hospitality tray. We have stayed here before and will certainly stay again. We have just enjoyed an afternoon snack of a meat and cheese board in McGettigans bar and it was superb, lots of lovely cheese varieties, grapes, chutney, olives, crackers, bread and butter. The staff are really friendly and helpful and keen to ensure we are enjoying our stay and have everything we need. Our upgraded room ( thank you Rhona) means we have access to the premier lounge where we have just enjoyed a cappuccino looking over the landscape of Dublin city centre. The weather has been kind to us and we had the sliding doors fully open without a breath of wind. All in all a great stay and we will certainly stay again next year and highly recommend to other visitors. We intend to dine here this evening as the menu looks great with keen prices. Location is great with everything within walking distance. Free WIFI also if that is on your list as an important factor.",5,2015,08,29
219,Comfortable rooms and good food,"We stayed for five nights in a premium club room and I do think it is worth paying the extra for the upgraded rooms. It is still very good value overall, in comparison with other 4 star hotels, The bedroom and bathroom are very well appointed and nicely decorated. The continental breakfast which is included in the price is excellent with freshly baked croissants and really good cooked meats - well above the usual standard. We also ate extremely well  in the restaurant and would recommend it for lunch or dinner. We had access to the premier lounge and had coffee there a couple of times a day.
The location is convenient. It may not be Dublin's most prestigious address but the access to public transport is very good,  the surrounding area is well used by commuters, office workers and shoppers and feels very safe.
My one caveat is that, for anyone with mobility issues, the lifts cannot be accessed at reception and you have a flight of steps to climb, with your luggage, and a walk to the lifts on the next floor.",4,2015,08,29
219,Nice place,"Stayed only one night before leaving to France - got a free upgrade for some reason...Yeahhh^^ Love the place but the area...ummmm NO!!(not for me) room looks great, big size, got a balcony lol , super comfortable bed, staff not that friendly - no chance to try breakfast...",5,2015,08,28
219,north star hotel,"Room was a fantastic size with a great bathroom. It was very warm and to keep the window open you had to listen to traffic all night. Food and staff were excellent. Great location and within walking distance of the city centre. My husband and I walked everywhere but you were also close to public transport.
      
      
      ",4,2015,08,27
219,"Central, busy, fun!","When travelling solo on business to Dublin,  I often stay at the North Star. It has a few things going for it, it has a great cental location and is handy for both the financial area and Temple Bar, both being less than 10 mins walk. 

The hotel is definitely a tourist hotel but that makes it lively and there is always a bit of life in the bar (often lacking in the more expensive hotels in the financial centre). I usually end up chatting to Americans or Italians or both. 

The rooms are of a good standard, the staff are always friendly and welcoming and I always enjoy staying there and it's always better value than many of the other hotels.",4,2015,08,25
219,A gem of a hotel,"I stayed in a family room with three of my friends for a surprise birthday get away for one night. The hotel is stylish, clean and in a central location with easy access to all transport links. The staff are superb- friendly, helpful and attentive. 
The room was modern and well stocked with tea coffee, shampoo etc. although there is some noise from a train line that runs behind the building, the train does not run through the night so a lovely sleep was had by all in comfortable beds. It does get a little warm in the room, but there is air-con which is a little noisy.
We did not eat at the hotel, however we were impressed by the menu and the surroundings and if staying longer would have eaten there as the menu was impressive. 
We had a great trip: the Irish people are by far the most welcoming, friendly people I've met and we loved every minute of our stay in What is one of my favourite cities.",4,2015,08,22
219,Feel right at home @ this hotel,"Wonderful staff and great room. I arrived in the early morning without warning, but they got me a room right away. I had food from the restaurant delivered to the room without any problem, and they efficiently addressed my other requests as well. Very friendly and helpful. When I had to take the 5am airport shuttle (only ‚Ç¨5), they packed me a breakfast. My only negatives were that the room was too warm (August visit), and that my particular room was about 15 feet from a very frequently running train. I don't think this would be an issue with most rooms at the hotel. Great location too. Walked everywhere.",4,2015,08,21
219,A quick trip,"The hotel is beautiful with great rooms.  I stayed in August for 3 nights and had a pleasant stay.  Even though the room wasn't air-conditioned (I had a standard room), the temperature outside was cool enough so that you can sleep with a window open and be comfortable.",5,2015,08,21
219,Short Stay in Quality Hotel,Stayed two nights here on a break away. Staff were amazing and helpful. Room was spotless. Pleasure to stay in and would stay again. Good location beside the train station and short walk down Talbot Street to town.,5,2015,08,20
219,A Short Stay,"I spent a couple nights here.  The individual at the front desk was quite cold and impersonal when I arrive during a hail storm (Yes!) but I liked my room.  The bed was comfy and bath clean.  Breakfast, included with my room, was delicious & a great start to each day.  It was a little off the beaten path but not terribly so.",4,2015,08,18
219,"Convenient, but nothing special","I stayed here with a large tour group and had a room in a corner on the ground floor across the parking lot from the main building.  Breakfast was very good, and the restaurant was alright.  But the room was dreary, with a commuter train outside my window and the neighborhood transitional.  I probably wouldn't choose to stay here on my own.",3,2015,08,16
219,Fab location ,"Stayed here for 3 nights, really nice hotel. Very clean, with lovely furnishings. Great location the airport bus drops you very close, and the dart station is just in front, town centre is a 10minute walk. Staff all friendly and willing to help. Also free access to gym and sauna. Can't fault it x",4,2015,08,15
219,Restaurant not bad,I went to the restaurant on business an got seated quickly although they could do with more tables as it was mostly reserved tables. I had the burger which was lovely and chips. My colleagues had the seabass  and fish and chips which was nice also. Prices are a little high but quality is good. ,4,2015,08,13
219,Great location and stay!,"We were lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the premiere rooms and the stay was fantastic. The hotel is definitely an older building, but had been redone and is comfortable for the modern traveler. By that I mean all the basic amenities and needs were met, the rooms were beautiful and comfortable, but sometimes the floorboards squeaked. I appreciated the helpfulness of the staff, the early check in, and the access to the premiere lounge with it's snacks and water. GREAT location. It was a 10-15 minute walk to Trinity, and the LUAS redline was at the next corner. The train ran right behind our room, but the noise was hardly noticeable.The interior soundproofing wasn't the greatest, though. We could hear people in the hallway, and it sometimes sounded like they were in our room (unpleasant feeling if you're in bed). Overall, great stay, and would definitely stay again.",4,2015,08,12
219,Wee gem of a find!,On North side of the river. 10min walk to Temple Bar. Airlink 747 bus stops outside. Only 20min transfer 10‚Ç¨ return. Quite posh. Nice room/bathroom. Lovely buffet English brekkie. Grubby area though!!,4,2015,08,12
219,very helpful,"The staff were very friendly and more than helpful,hotel has obviously had a facelift,all good.We will definitely be back very soon.We were visiting Dublin for a football game,hotel is 100 yards from bus station,10 minutes walk from O Connell st,10 mins walk from football stadium,so we couldn't have been more centrally located.All in all a great stay",5,2015,08,09
219,Quirky but nice hotel ,Initially we chose North Star because it was close to the centre of Dublin and had a parking facility. First impression was that it was a bit of a maze however staff were great and it didn't  take long to understand the place and relax. Breakfast was above average and our room was great - softest bed! Great sleep. After getting over the tight inner city check in I'd recommend this hotel which is not far from everything. ,4,2015,08,09
219,Nine day stay was excellent,"My wife and I stayed at the North Star Hotel for 9 days and used Dublin as a base for exploring the city and the surrounding area. The hotel itself was fantastic. The rooms were clean and tidy, the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The concierge helped us book city tours and helped us find different attractions that we could explore. Finally, the restaurant that is attached to the hotel was the only place we ate twice during our stay. The Goat Cheese Spring Rolls are probably the best thing I ate in the city.

I would highly recommend this hotel. The price is right, the location is great, the staff is helpful and the rooms are clean.",4,2015,08,09
219,Amazing,"Well my daughter and I have just returned from a four night stay in this hotel . Fantastic it was my daughters 18 th and we were given a room upgrade to a premier king room .It was so lovely .We also got to use the premier lounge for breakfast where tea coffe ,cereal and pastries were available plus juices in a relaxing atmosphere .
Our room was so comfortable the bed was amazing .Everything was spotless the room was cleaned and fresh towels everyday .
All the staff were very helpful with directions and everyone we met had a smile .
We enjoyed the 2 for1 cocktails on Wednesday night both the bar and outside seating area were beautifully decorated and a joy to sit in.
We even tried the gym and sauna fab
We were only a 10 minute walk to everything shops, bars and museums
This hotel made my daughters birthday very special and our trip to dublin very enjoyable 

A big thank you to everyone",5,2015,08,09
219,"Great hotel, stay away from the restaurant in the lobby.","Hotel and staff were great, very friendly and happy to help with what we needed.  the sold the electronic converter in the lobby, which was a huge help.  Had dinner in the lobby restaurant, and it was horrible from beginning to end.  We were seated in the very back for no reason, only offered bottled water (when the rest of the tables had tap) and then over charged.  We had the fish and chips and it came with only ONE small piece of fish...very disappointing.  I would give the hotel itself higher marks, but because of the restaurant experience it lowered my rating.",3,2015,08,09
219,Long Weekend stay with friends,"I was a little anxious about staying at this hotel reading some of the reviews.  However we all had a brilliant time.  The staff at check-in were great and took minutes to book all 4 couples in. Each room we had were really nice, no complaints from anyone.  Having the aircon was a bonus.

The bathrooms are quite small but were really clean.  Maids came in every day.

We did not eat in the restaurant but we did have breakfast which was really good, although maybe a little overpriced.

The bar staff were fantastic.  We went to the bar every night before we headed out to dinner and they were all so friendly and helpful.  The outside seating area was nice too.

The location of the hotel is great as about a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar.  There was a general manager constantly walking around asking guests if everything was okay with their stay.

We all had a brilliant weekend at this hotel and if we were to visit Dublin again, would not hesitate to come back.",4,2015,08,07
219,Disappointed,"I've traveled a lot using the Tripadvisor's recommendations as my guideline during the last 5 years. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed. This time I just couldn't agree with the given evaluations on the hotel. Honestly, we expected more.

The room was in the basement, it was small and had a view (behind the dirty iron bars) to an alley. There was poor sound isolation, we could hear everything in the corridor and even outside in the alley. Room had a very small TV, no minibar and only one duvet (although big one) for two people. We found a dead insect from the bed and my spouse had her eyes irritated by the bad air condition inside the room. The room and the corridors were also really dark. Bathroom smelled like mold and didn't dry after shower. The shower also didn't have enough pressure. The bathtub was nice thou. The breakfast was not included. We bought the continental breakfast 8,5‚Ç¨ one morning and it had no kind of fresh vegetables and only very few fruits. The hotel itself was a labyrinth, where you never really knew which way to go.

The service was good, but couldn't make up for the overall shortcomings.",2,2015,08,06
219,Lovely hotel ,"Lovely hotel, staff so polite and welcoming. We had half board and enjoyed the food very much. Would certainly stay again.

We went out late one night, and the doors to enter was closed, however we quietly knocked and was let straight in! Thank you to the staff who also assisted us when we had an issue outside with a member of the public who was quite abusive, not the hotels fault at all. They helped us feel safe and was very reassuring. Many thanks 

",4,2015,08,04
219,Perfect for a city break.,"Highly recommend this hotel after staying here for two nights. Staff are very friendly, and the rooms are exactly what you need if you're in the city for a few nights. Location is excellent, just yards away from the trams which gives you easy access to all the attractions in the city. But if you don't fancy using the tram, all the nearest restaurants, pubs etc and the Temple Bar district are a short 5-10 minute walk away. There are some reviews on here saying that the tram makes it a bit noisy but we were at the back of the hotel so we never noticed this. Another huge plus to staying here is the breakfast! They provide everything you can think of and it is all delicious. The restaurant next door which is accessible through the lobby is also excellent and the staff are really friendly and brilliant at what they do. Will be returning to Dublin again soon after a great weekend and will be heading for the North Star again.",4,2015,08,04
219,"Friendly staff, lovely hotel","Visited this hotel last week with 3 friends, on arrival we had been upgraded to a suite, staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our apartment was very clean and spacious. Breakfast at the hotel was excellent with plenty of choice. The staff in the restaurant were brilliant especially Deirdre. Already planning our next visit.",5,2015,08,03
219,Nice Hotel,"I can recommend this hotel, we enjoyed our stay. The Hotel is clean and the staff were happy and friendly. It is very close to the center of Dublin and opposite the railway station. Despite it's close proximity to the station we did not hear any trains.
      ",5,2015,08,03
219,"Great hotel, location and food","Just got back from a weekend break at this hotel.    Fab hotel, staff and location.  A steady 15 minute walk into temple bar area great for shopping and seeing the sites, close to,the river and the amazing bridges.  Staff were hard working and looked after you.  Had a double room which was adequate for our needs.  Very comfortable bed and coffee making facilities in the room.   In room safe too which was great.  Breakfast was amazing, plenty of choice and again hardworking staff.   Lovely meal in the restaurant the food is superb I had the lamb shank and my husband had steak we were both impressed.   Excellent value for money will definetly be returning and will recommend this hotel to,our friends.  Thank you staff at the North Star hotel you certainly know how to look after your customers.",5,2015,08,02
219,Very old hotel but does not seem old.,"Yes this hotel is old, yes you have to walk up 14 stairs from front desk to the elevator, but they will help you with your baggage if you wish. The front desk on check in was very pleasant and helpful as we were tired driving for at least 4 hours to get there.  The room had three beds, was clean, overlooking the small parking lot for the hotel.
Yes they have valet parking which was great. We spent two nights and did not need the car to get around.  The breakfast each morning was typical Irish breakfast we had during our nine days of vacation.
The staff for Breakfast was very friendly and very good at removing the dirty dishes. The food was good. I really enjoy the make your own pancake machine.
Check out was smooth and the staff from house keeping to front desk did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable.",4,2015,08,02
219,Lovely hotel and staff,"Visited here last week to celebrate an anniversary. The staff were all helpful and welcoming and the hotel looked modern and clean. The public areas were stylish and comfortable. We had a classic double. It was a standard room and the bathroom was rather dated compared to the rest of the room and hotel. The housekeeping staff were fantastic, high standard of cleaning and even replenished all the toiletries each day even if half empty - supplying 4 of each product! Which is rare in some hotels. However one fairly big criticism is the location of our room was very noisy. Throughout the night we heard doors slamming. Also each morning we were woken very early to a food delivery truck outside our window. However it is in a good location with travel facilities close by and the Main Street 5 minutes walk away. The food was also of a high standard as we did have an evening meal one of the nights. I would recommend this hotel and we had an enjoyable stay.",4,2015,07,30
219,Good Hotel - Great Staff,"Stayed here during a vacation in Ireland.  It's in a convenient location - Connolly train station across the street as well as several bus stops and a taxi stand that made getting around Dublin very easy.  The staff are really nice - they helped us with our bags, directions, printing transportation schedules, dining recommendations.  Free breakfast was part of our vacation package and was pretty good - try the popcake (pancake) maker and make your own pancakes.  It was buffet style with plenty of options to choose from.  The restaurant at the hotel was great.  Make sure to get a room on the third floor and above, especially if you're a light sleeper.  When we stayed on a lower floor (2nd floor) on the second leg of our trip, we could hear the constant street noise and I don't believe those rooms have air conditioning.  Floors 3 and above are newer and have air conditioning.  Also, you have to take the stairs to the elevator - something to keep in mind if you have a lot of luggage and/or have mobility issues.",4,2015,07,29
219,Second visit & took a Premier King top floor room,"10 minutes from O'Connell Street. Opposite Connolly Railway station, bus and tram stops. Great staff throughout but special mention to bar staff Paddy, John and Sean (who never stops working!) Tiny smoking area for the lepers. Great views across the city from top floor balcony. Special private room with free snacks and bottled water for Premier King residents. Great bed but not as good as Classic Double Room for some reason.",4,2015,07,29
219,"Clean, Efficient, Relaxing","This hotel is not the most centrally located (yet it's still in walking distance or a short taxi ride to everything.) But if you want a clean, comfortable, charming hotel with a delicious breakfast service then the North Star is for you. While they have maintained the historical charm of the downstairs (I kept imagining Oscar Wilde dropping in for tea or a pint) the guest rooms are entirely modern. We REALLY appreciated the lounge on the 7th floor with its 24 hour complimentary tea, coffee, and bottled water. They offer a full hot Irish Breakfast with eggs, bacon, black and white pudding, sausage, potatoes and tomatoes, and also cereals, pastries, etc. We loved Dublin and we definitely want to return.",5,2015,07,28
219,'Secret Hotel' - so glad we tried it,"My partner booked this hotel through Lastminute.com's Secret Hotel, and it was terrific. Its location, in a poorer part of Dunlin, probably would have put us off if we'd been booking direct, and our taxi driver warned us to be careful when walking about at night, but we need not have worried. The hotel is genuinely 4-star with lovely decor and excellent staff; we had a room in the new section away from the traffic (with air conditioning - make sure to ask when booking) which was beautiful, the bed was great, the bathroom excellent. We ate in the restaurant which was really super delicious (an excellent decision on a very wet Sunday evening). As for the aforementioned  neighbourhood, it IS typical train station territory, but there was no sign of anything seedy going on as we and loads of other tourists walked about at about 9pm. Just a few minutes around the corner and we were in the middle of the main shopping district- excellent! ",5,2015,07,27
219,A week's stay in the north Star,"We stayed one week in a room on the first floor, just opposite the car park. The pics here on the web site look nicer than from the window of our room. There was a terrible noice outside at night and in the morning like a jet trying to start. We did not notice the nearby trains from the station as some customers remarked.
The personnel was very friendly, the service in the breakfast room was excellent as was the breakfast. The waiters were very attentive and helpful. Bus shuttle service  to the air port ordered at the reception worked fine. The location for a short stay is OK, not to far from the city centre, The Celt pub only some hundred yards away, two other pubs round the corner.
Anyway - we liked it!

219,Great spot for an Ireland stop.,"The hotel is located near the heart of the city, within walking distance of nearly all the major sites and across the street from a major rail/bus station. We found our room to be very comfortable, the staff to be very helpful--answering our questions and helping us deal with the airline when our luggage was lost, and the breakfast to be good.",5,2015,07,27
219,Perfect!,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my family to celebrate my husbands 50th and daughters 18th. Hotel was delightful. We arrived on an early flight and left the luggage at reception until out room was ready. A central location, 15 minute walk to Temple Bar area, less to the shops! When we checked in, we were kindly upgraded to a family suite, room 270, it was perfect. We had a lovely meal in the hotel restaurant that evening with complimentary prosecco. The staff were so helpful and friendly, we were made to feel very special. Breakfast was equally perfect with something for everyone. We will definitely be back. Thank you!!",5,2015,07,24
219,Bliss couple getaway,"This hotel was lovely. Not too far from the town centre, the room was great, kept clean and refreshments were topped up daily. Also I paid extra for the full Irish breakfast which was definitely worth it as there was so much choice to choose from. The only downfall I had was that our room was next to a tram track so that was a little loud at times but I think that was just the location of our room in the building. Overall this was a great hotel and I would recommend! The staff were very friendly and attentive.",4,2015,07,23
219,Birthday celebration,"The location of the hotel was fine for us, about 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar area.  We were very disappointed with our room (Room 266) as it had the most disgusting smell of dried urine, so we requested be be moved to a different room.  Obviously not a great start to our weekend away.  Not comparable with other 4**** hotels we have stayed in before.",2,2015,07,22
219,Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed at the North Star in July. The Hotel is located very near the centre of the city, the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was a reasonable size, clean and comfortable, we did not eat in the restaurant in the evening but the breakfast was very nice. I can recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay again",5,2015,07,22
219,Very Mixed Feelings About This Hotel!,"First off, let me just say that this is a great mid-sized hotel in great condition, in a great location and good value for the prices you pay.  The rooms are quite spacious and feature a quasi chic d√©cor.  I also loved the Moorish statues at the boom of the grand staircase in front of the entrance.  So, all in all, the hotel itself is great, it's staff, however, are not!  I must say, this hotel has the most inattentive, lackadaisical and, sometimes, down right rude staff I have ever encountered.  After check in, with the exception of the housekeeping staff (who kept my room absolutely spotless during my stay) the service level dropped off completely!  In my day to day goings in and out of the hotel, the front desk reception never even acknowledged me as I passed the desk, half the time they didn't even bother to look up from their computers!  For all they knew (or cared) I could had been Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy casually strolling into the guest quarters!  It wasn't until the very last night of my 10 day stay that I met a receptionist who actually seemed to care about her in house guests.  She was a lady with blond hair and worked the night shift as she let me inside the hotel my last night there and also checked me out the following morning.  Of all the staff, she was the only one who acknowledged me (actually said, ""Hello!"", ""Good Morning/Day/Evening!"") and inquired as to my well being while there (""How was your stay?"").  Her coworkers could and should take a hint from their much more professional coworker.  First off, a smile doesn't cost a thing and, if you seek employment as front of house staff in the hospitality field, you cannot possess an ""I Don't Care/Oh whatever"" attitude!

I should also mention that, about the 5th or 6th day into my stay, the hotel carried out some repairs/refurbishments on my floor.  Although the hotel did offer to relocate everyone on my floor to other floors, I had absolutely fallen in love with my room (with it's lovely view) and decided to stay.  What I don't understand is that, if the hotel had scheduled maintenance during this time, why would they bother to book these rooms in the first place only to inconvenience guests by having to relocate them after a few days?",3,2015,07,22
219,Close to train station,"This is a really nice hotel.  We chose it because it is close to the train station, it's right across the road.  A bit of a walk to the Temple Bar area, but not too bad really.  Right next to a  Super Valu store as well.  The staff was wonderful and the room was very nice.  This hotel did have A/C so that is a plus.  Internet is good and the price for the hotel is fairly reasonable.  Fairly quiet area after dark.  No problems for us whatsoever.  Shuttle to the airport for 5 euro per person.  We took advantage of that.  A lot cheaper than a taxi and quicker than the bus.   Picks you up right out the door of the hotel.",4,2015,07,22
219,Lovely Room,"The stayed in The North Star hotel for a weekend break. We'd booked a Premier King room and it was lovely. A good size room and with a small balcony, a fridge and a very comfortable bed. We ate in the hotel the first night and the food was good and reasonably priced. The hotel is nicely situated as it is an easy walk to the River Liffey  and shops. 

One or two niggles though, we had entry to the Corporate Lounge where we were supposed to have coffee and snacks available but we couldn't find any snacks and at 10 pm there were no clean coffee cups. There was no water in the fridge (although we collected some from the lounge) no biscuits were supplied with the tea/coffee tray and the toilet paper was the horrible cheap type. These things are penny-pinching and not what you expect when you book a premier room.",4,2015,07,20
219,Ideal place to see Dublin from,"second visit to this hotel.  We had a room in the old part of the hotel.  The room was huge and well appointed, but there is no aircon in the old part - it was very stuffy and uncomfortable at night but much more of a problem is the traffic noise.  Breakfast is great and it really sets you up for the day.  Right by the tram stop, bus station and Connolly train station, it could not be better placed",4,2015,07,19
219,Dublin trip,"We had the best time in the North Star hotel and staff were brill,we will be back to stay at this hotel again,and will tell all my family and friends to go to the North Star Hotel,the room was big and had everything we needed,
      
      ",5,2015,07,19
219,It was ok - just ok,"Lots of energy needed to stay here. The lift is at the top of the stairs and along a corridor! ! The reception looks very nice and you can get into the bar/restaurant next door from there too.  Both myself and my husband had a large suitcase and a heavy hand luggage each,  which we had to lug up the stairs in reception, along a corridor and through a set of doors, before reaching the lift!! The room was ok and clean. The beds were very comfy, with nice fresh bedding. The bathroom however was a different matter. It was very grubby, with stained grout, I have taken some pictures. It really did not make you want to have a shower in there. There is a mini mart next to the hotel if you need to stock up on provisions. I would not really recommend to friends.",3,2015,07,19
219,"The good, the bad, the ugly. ","We stayed here on a Sunday after a red eye flight from the States and had a decent enough experience. They must have over booked or something because we were ""upgraded"" to one of their premier rooms. The room was clean (a bit small), bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice. Staff was nice and we enjoyed our stay. This stay was 4 star. 

After spending the next few nights around other parts of Ireland, we returned to Dublin for the final leg of our trip. We checked back into the north star, arrived in our room....The room was VERY hot and soon we discovered that it had no A/C. This must be a Euro thing because I would never even think twice about a room having A/C. The only reprieve was to open a window to a very loud and busy street (train station). We soon called the front desk to ask for another room with A/C. They gave us a room in what we are jokingly now referring to as the dungeon. This room is straight out of 1980. The bathroom is gross (the grout is BLACK...definitely used to be white), the bed and pillows remind me of college and the room is so small. The ""A/C"" has been on full blast since we got here and actually the room is now hotter. I think someone is doing tile work in the room above us! 

This stay so far is one star at best. 

I'm frantically trying to find another hotel to stay in tonight, I'm on my freaking honeymoon for Pete's sake....",2,2015,07,18
219,North Star Dublin City Centre,"We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night. In Dublin for a weekend city break. The hotel is located close to the train and bus stations so very convenient. The room was comfortable clean and a good size, tea and coffee making facilities provided. En suite was clean also. Staff are friendly and helpful. The restaurant is well recommended, the food very good as is the service. Breakfast choice is from a wide variety of cooked and continental. I thought the cooked breakfast was great. The only draw back when we were there it was a warm night and opening a window meant sleeping was difficult due to road noise,  no air conditioning. We were in the old part of the hotel and the new part may have air conditioning. Although the trains run nearby don't let that put you off they are barely noticeable. Easy walk to O'Connell Street and city centre attractions and big name shops.",4,2015,07,17
219,Not all rooms are created equal,"Location is good - walkable to pretty much anything and train station is just across the street. Our family room was extremely cramped - not as spacious as pictures depict. Accent blankets and pillows were the only remodeling done to our guest room - online pics must be of renovated Premier rooms. Mattresses were lumpy but we were still able to sleep ok. Bathroom was outdated and grout was practically black. We also kept getting smells of urine from a corner of our room and in the bathroom. Fire alarms, drilling, sawing all happened during our stay with no warning or apology. McGettigan's is good with a great beer garden - Sean was particularly very kind. This is a two star hotel at best. ",2,2015,07,16
219,"Lovely stay, very comfy beds!","My friend and I visited Dublin for the weekend and found this hotel via trip advisor. Most of the reviews looked positive so we booked up.
The hotel has great curb appeal, and we were warmly welcomed. The hotel is located in short walking distance from shops, bars and tourist sites.
The room was very clean and the bed was very comfy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who want a relaxed weekend break.",4,2015,07,15
219,Not what was expected -- 2 star at best,"The pictures presented for this hotel are very misleading:  the rooms were old and grungy, and very much in need of updating.  The beds were terrible.  The front desk staff were also not very helpful.  The concierge, for example, sat and watched me struggle through the narrow front door with luggage.  We booked tickets for the airport coach, which was also quite old and grungy, and dropped us quite a distance from the terminal.  (We paid a similar amount to stay at the Shelbourne Hotel later in our vacation -- which was wonderful.)",1,2015,07,14
219,Poor experience!!,"This is my first review of a hotel - normally I don't feel the need to, but in this instance I felt compelled.

My fianc√© and I had booked a couple of nights at the North Star and we were very disappointed with the hotel overall - here's why:

First morning we were woken at 7am by drilling above our room. We notified the reception in the first instance, but to no avail. The second time we rang, and we managed to get speaking to the manager. He insisted that there were no works being undertaken at the hotel, and that the noise was coming from across the street (which also persisted during our stay). After offering no apologies and with some struggle, we convinced the manager to visit our room to hear for himself.

He arrived and continued to argue that the noise was out of the hotels control - we found his lack of understanding very frustrating and unprofessional. It was only when a cleaning manager (who was lovely during our entire stay) passed the room, informing us and the manager that there was in fact workmen directly above our room, fixing the air conditioning. How the manager didn't know the works going on in his on hotel is still beyond me. After the manager reluctantly accepted defeat, he left saying he would look into the situation. We were later moved to another room for our second night, but found the whole episode very annoying.

The fire alarm also went off twice during our stay - the second time was the following morning. We were instructed to head to the courtyard as a result but found no organisation of staff or guests, just a group of people with no clue what was going on. Again, another morning ruined.

Our stay was booked via late rooms as a 4 star hotel - something I would certainly dispute. In the end, we were pleased to be checking out, and will not be returning to visit again. ",2,2015,07,14
219,No way a 4 star,"Room smelt of cigarettes, towels are thin cheap ones, they thought it fine to get construction works to pull the room apart underneath me from 8am in the morning, they shut off the water when a I tried to take a shower, twice someone came through the door in the morning to clean the room with just that slight knock that you don't have time to respond to then they just walk in on top of you. Its very simple to check with front desk who has checked out of not. Parking is tough since it's very hard to get in and out of. Place would be fine if you were without a car staying in the city but it's not 4 star by any means.",2,2015,07,13
219,"Comfortable, moderately-priced, central hotel","Some may remember the North Star as a rather ordinary pub-style hotel, but following refurbishment in recent years the whole ambience has been transformed and the hotel now offers spacious, well-appointed rooms and a very good bar and restaurant, as well as hearty buffet breakfasts. The hotel could not be better placed - opposite Connolly Station (DART and mainline) with direct LUAS (tram) service to Dublin's other mainline station, Heuston; round the corner from the central bus station and airport buses; and five minutes' walk from O'Connell Street. It is an excellent choice for a city break or as a stopover en route for rail travellers to other parts of Ireland.",4,2015,07,12
219,Overnight Stay for Fleetwood Mac Concert,"Have just come from a nights stay at the North Star Hotel, what a great place with helpful, pleasant staff, to be honest we were sorry to leave.  Breakfast was really good with plenty of selection.  This hotel is directly opposite the train station so location is perfect for convenience.  I will definitely return to this hotel only next time it will be longer. The only thing I would say is we had a few cocktails before we went to the concert and they weren't very good so that was a bit disappointing as the bill was 73 euro but that would be my only criticism and hopefully that can be improved on.",5,2015,07,12
219,"Excellent Hotel - Great Location for the many attractions in Dublin, Ireland","My wife and I was very much impressed with this hotel,  The room was very spacious and very clean.  The staff was very friendly and helped us get tickets for a show in Dublin.  They gave us a very helping hand with directions and provided maps with the locations highlighted for attractions for us to see.  It was like having your own touring guide.  We would highly recommend this hotel for others staying in Dublin.  Very convenient for bus and  rail transportation.",4,2015,07,11
219,Fab Hotel,"Stayed at North Star Hotel last week. The hotel itself was lovely, clean, spacious rooms, lovely lounge / bar restaurant / area. Very relaxing, and lovely atmosphere.
The beds were super comfy, and air conditioning was very good.
The food was fabulous, and the cocktails are 2 for 1 on a Wednesday which we took full advantage of. Drinks and food cheaper than in Temple Bar which was very expensive.
Shops restaurants and bars within walking distance. Temple Bar was a very short taxi drive away
Hotel staff were lovely, helpful, and friendly, especially David, who was so friendly, and always had a lovely smile for us!  Sean? ( night bar man ) aswell as John were also both very helpful, and friendly.
All in all a Fab hotel, and Fab staff..We will definitely stay here again!!",5,2015,07,11
219,Go all out for the premier room,"I had booked a standard room which was OK but the aircon was not working - as soon as I reported this to reception they sent someone up to check it out, confirmed it was true and transferred me to a premier room - WOW - fantastic room, fantastic service, great nights sleep, great breakfast, parking at a reasonable rate, really helpful friendly cheerful staff. Brilliant location close to rail, tram and bus network.",5,2015,07,10
219,"bit noisy, but good price/performance-ratio","small, but clean rooms, well equipped, breakfast very ok, but not as continental as expected neither variable, noise from street & dart-train, well located to easily get into the city/suburbia, after all good price/performance-ratio",4,2015,07,10
219,Fantastic Hotel,"I'm a regular visitor to this hotel for both business and pleasure and it's one of the best hotels in Dublin for comfort, customer service and fantastic food. I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,07,10
219,Pleasant find,"Stayed in many places in Dublin, but this little gem is great and reasonably priced. with so many hotels resembling the inside of a space ship this is modern yet comfy and staff really are welcoming and warming. Stayed for business and would certainly stay again, a good place if you get it on a good deal and just far enough out of the madness, yet close enough to walk back to.",5,2015,07,09
219,comfortable hotel," comfortable quiet rooms in premium club but overlooking very close railway, rooms very warm we needed the air con,breakfast very good. drinks expensive. A good 20 minutes walk to any decent restaurants.close to buses and trains",4,2015,07,08
219,Lovely decor...Don't go past the bridge!!,"We travelled to Dublin for a weekend adventure. (Dublin is amazing) 

We spent a little time in the hotel. The hotel decor was a little confused. The room was very spacious. I wasn't very fond of the choice of furniture for the wardrobe or the dressing table. The hotel reception, bar and lobby is very chic but the room was more like a 70s/80s making an effort to get to 2015. It would be nice if the hotel replicated each other in all aspects. Our room was too hot. The hotel are aware of this because there were two fans in our room (only one worked). Our room was on the end next to the bridge where trains would go past. Its loud and a little annoying. The good thing is that they don't drive past at night so you'll get a good sleep. The beds are large and very comfortable. 

The staff were very friendly. We went when there was a big boxing match that my partner was oh so desperate to see and the guy in reception was ringing around hotels nearby to see who was showing this match. This is going above and beyond and for this we thank you! Wifi has a very good signal too which I was very happy with. 

The breakfast ranged from full Irish to healthy fruit and yogurt. Delicious all round. 

The hotel is near the city centre. You could probably walk it to the centre if the weather is good. Alternatively  there are busses not far away or you can flag down a taxi which are parked outside. 

We were told by one taxi driver not to go past the bridge, so I pass this message to you if you are considering staying at this hotel.. Don't go past he bridge!!",3,2015,07,08
219,Great hotel.....food Where is it!!?? ,"We use this hotel everytime we come to Dublin. It's great value,  lovely rooms, comfy beds and nice staff.
This last stay we decided to use the restaurant for a meal before a concert .
All nice in restaurant. ..saw the special of the day "" roast beef dinner "" the table next to us had it , it was huge .Result . We then saw the "" 2 course for ‚Ç¨19:99 "" great we thought get the main and sweet . The roast of day was cheaper than main meals so you'd think it be on 2 for deal ....NO . we then thought "" well if other mains are as big as the roast then it will be good .we ordered chicken breast meal , I got fish and chips . The meals came ..we looked at each other ..kinda thinking there was more  to come....NO ! TO SAY they were small was an understatement. The waitress layer asked if it was OK. .I said "" no there was hardly food!  She didn't do, say anything! !  The size of portion was so small we both went for pizza right after we left! !  
Apart  from that and a broken toilet seat ( room 364) it was OK .We will be back ..but will eat out . ",4,2015,07,08
219,Monday Night Over Night Stay Dublin,"I had to stay in Dublin due to an early morning meeting in the city.  The North Star is a real Gem of a hotel close to Connolly Train Station, Car parking provided at an excellent 8‚Ç¨ over night rate, Check in was fast & friendly.  My room was on the 7th floor, large room with some bright furnishing which was a welcome change from the norm, nice size bedroom, decent coffee, Bath robe & Slippers provided.  I had dinner in the Bar which was buzzing for a Monday night, lots of excellent waiter staff working who knew the menu well.  I had starter & main course which came with a glass of complimentary Prosecco,  Lots of tourists around.  Gym provided which is a great perk for the business travel.  Overall very impressive and I look forward to going back again to this great hotel for both business and personal.",5,2015,07,07
219,Location,Great location for sightseeing. Trains and buses are less than a block away and it's a short stroll to the Liffey.  The restaurant & bar is Dublin's newest and the food was very good.  Watch for the daily specials.,4,2015,07,07
219,Central Hotel,This hotel is very central to every where and any where you want to go in Dublin. You can get to the Dublin Horse show or to any of the great theaters in Dublin. Great hotel to say in and great food and wonderful rooms.,5,2015,07,07
219,When I am going to concerts in Dublin I stay at The North Star,"The North Star Hotel is where myself and other family members stay when in Dublin. The staff are very friendly and helpfull, the rooms are very nice and comfortable.  We always pay the extra for the breakfast, which is amazing.  The breakfast room is roomy and well lit, the food is great and the staff working there are more that helpfull, I cannot rate The North Star Hotel highly enough.  I will be staying there again.",5,2015,07,07
219,Ok stay!!,"I booked a normal double but was offered a free upgrade to a premium king room which was great news as we were staying 2 nights. When entering the room we found it rather small so goodness knows what the normal doubles were like!! The bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom was clean and tidy. The television didn't offer many channels and the TV reception was a bit fuzzy. Also being a 4 star hotel I would of thought the mini bar in the room would be stocked up but no it was an empty fridge. 
We were at the front of the hotel with the train line outside our room so it turned out to be quite noisy. Generally the staff were very helpful and friendly. So mixed reviews about this hotel.",3,2015,07,07
219,Central,"A really central hotel, a short walk to the Temple bar entertainment area and right beside Connolly Station.  Rooms clean and tidy with an excellent breakfast.  What set this hotel apart for me was the friendliness of the staff.  They really couldn't do enough for us.  I will go back next time I'm in Dublin  ",5,2015,07,06
219,Great food. Nice and clean.,"We went in here today for food before a hurling match and met up with family here. . Lovely relaxed atmosphere, the food was very tasty and staff were very friendly. We'll visit again. Great location too. ",5,2015,07,05
219,Can't wait to go back,We went here as a couple staying for the first time in Dublin great experience the staff were very welcoming and after getting there really early and thinking we wouldn't be able to check in straight away we were delighted when they gave us our room key straight away. The breakfast was great with a good choice. The location is just right to get around sight seeing only a few minutes walk to occonnell street,5,2015,07,05
219,Comfortable Stay,"I stayed at the North Star whilst attending a concert at the 3 Arena, which is in easy walking distance or one can take the tram which stops just round the corner. On arrival I was upgraded to one of the executive rooms with balcony on the 6th floor but the pleasure of this was slightly dimmed by the wonderful view of the railway tracks! The room itself was comfortable with all the amenities one would expect but it was nothing outstanding however the bed was supremely comfortable. Everywhere was very clean. The bathroom was nice but the lighting is seriously inadequate and impossible to apply make-up by. The proximity to Connolly Station isn't actually a drawback unless one opens the patio doors, then the continual rail traffic is a nuisance and it is very handy if planning a trip by Dart to the coast.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and the restaurant pleasant.  All the staff I encountered were extremely friendly, kind and helpful.  Free WiFi throughout the hotel was a big plus and there is a PC and printer in the Residents lounge for free use by guests. I would certainly stay here again if visiting Dublin.",4,2015,07,04
219,Nice stay and great staff!,"We stayed a total of five nights at the North Star during three different visits on a recent tour of Ireland.  After our first stay, we weren't so sure about it.  Our room was very nice, but it was on the front of the hotel on Amiens Street.  It was in June and it was a little warm, so we tried to open our window, but the noise from the buses and trains (and a manhole cover) was too much.  However, our rooms for the next two stays were toward the back of the hotel and our stay was perfect!  The staff was very nice and very helpful, and we enjoyed sitting in the bar in the evenings.",4,2015,07,03
219,A place to sleep...,"This was a hotel selected in travel package that we purchased.  It included a 2-night stay at the beginning of our trip and another 2-night stay at the end. 2 slightly different experiences, giving it an ok/middle of the road rating.

Let me start by saying the staff was amazing. Kind, courteous, informative, and helpful to the dumb americans...

We arrived early, checked our luggage at hotel and ventured out to explore and kill some time until our room was ready.  Once we were able to check in, we got to our room, and marveled at the differences in American and Irish Hotels. Being as tired as we were (not to mention cold - as our cooler weather gear was in our luggage during our exploring and it was cold and rainy), we decided to shower and nap a bit before dinner.  The beds...full size beds...my husband and I are used to the queen, so we knew we would be cramped, but ours had a BIG DIP in the middle...we both rolled to the center...I'm sure if we had said something they would have corrected the problem, but we decided we can live with it for 2 nights, we were too tired to really care anyway.  Let me say again, we did NOT complain. but we decided, we would ask for a different room upon our return at the end of the trip.

When we returned, we were asked if we wanted the same room as it was available.  We said we would love a different room, and they cheerfully made the switch for us.  The second room was wonderful.

We did go and talk to the concierge about taking a day trip the next day. He was quite informative and helpful.  His name escapes me now, but we took his suggestion and he arranged it for us. He recommended the tour that took us to Northern Ireland and into Belfast.  He told us about the wonderful things we could do, and we decided to take the risk and do it...that day tour was a highlight for us.  (Look for my other reviews soon, on this portion of our vacation.)

Back to the hotel..it really was a lovely hotel. Clean, just needed a bit of updating here and there but I think that they were working on that when we were there, and the first stay was in one of the older rooms.  The second was in a newer one.  I would stay here again, and would recommend it.  It is directly across the street from Connelly station, which makes it very convenient.  Also right on the edge of the sight seeing bus route, making it easy to see it all.

(being late to my reviews...I selected the furthest back that I could..but we traveled in late March/early April 2014.)",3,2015,06,30
219,Surprising,"From reading reviews about this hotel, I started to worry as there were quite a lot of bad reviews. When I arrived at this hotel, I was genuinely surprised as I thought our room was lovely. The bed was huge and very comfortable. If I knew where they bought all their furniture and bed sheets, I would change my own bedroom to this. I also saw reviews about bad noise levels from the train station. I'm a very light sleeper and I didn't have any problems with this.",4,2015,06,30
219,Just OK,Service was great however the property is old and tired. Had an awful smell in the corridor on the way to the lifts which they tried to hide with overpowering air freshener. Fantastic location as walking distance to main street. The pizza shop next door is amazing and the restaurant at the hotel is good with great service also. Beds very uncomfortable but saying that it was pretty cheap so you get what you pay for.,3,2015,06,30
219,Expectations exceeded.,"Hi Tripadvisor friends, What a wonderful place Ireland is,plenty to see and do.
On arrival we were greeted by a warm irish welcome, by the man on the conceirge desk,
We got checked in quickly by the receptionist, Maria a wonderful girl, the hotel was busy,
our room on the 6th floor was amazing, dropped our bags had a shower,and back downstairs, had a whiskey in the bar, middletons, and then back to checkout what to do,
On introducing ourselves to the conceirge, Kieran, we sat down and he explained what to do and see , restaurants etc, and i have to say,  he was 'On the money'.
We had tried to book an irish dancing show, earlier on in the week but told it was full, by the hotel, we mentioned this to kieran, he said to give him a couple of mins, he would ""sort it out"" and true to form he did!!  A table for six mysteriously appeared!. A great night of music and dancing,highly recommended.
The next day,we had a full irish breakfast, its on the lower ground floor, the lift access's
it, although it seemed to have a mind of its own.
The restaurant in the hotel as kieran explained has 3 of the ""better chefs in dublin"", I tend to agree, very tasty food.
All in all , a great time, Kilmainham goal was interesting ,as well as glasnevin cemetary,/botanical gardens and Howth.
We shall return.",5,2015,06,29
219,Amazing hotel,"I would recommend everybody  to stay at North Star hotel. This was our 5th stay at the hotel & we will go back again & again.  The staff are friendly, rooms are lovely, we usually stay in a premier king room but was upgraded to a junior suite on arrival, which made us very happy üòÑ . The staff at the bar McGettigans are always very welcoming & friendly .  5* from me üëç.",5,2015,06,26
219,Not bad for the price! ,"Groupon purchase with the rating being a 5 star hotel (as the hotel advertises) we paid for a 3 star! So when we arrived we were not overly disappointed when we got a 3 star room we got what we paid for! The rooms are clean the carpet smells of stale beer, the bathroom could use some updating and a little help removing the mildew! Location is in North Dublin directly across from the train station and as night approaches there are some shady characters who are in the area of the hotel! However during the day it is a great location just a few blocks from the Main Street (O'Connell St) which made getting around pretty nice! I would most likely stay here again the price and location were Right! ",4,2015,06,25
219,Not exactly what I expected,"Our stay at the North Star started off on a very sour note. The shuttle from the airport never picked us up. This was in spite of the 3 phone calls to the hotel. The staff continued to tell me that the shuttle was on its way. Then on the 3rd call they told me to take the bus which would leave us a short walk to the hotel. The reason I picked this hotel was because it offered shuttle service to and from the airport. I wasn't about to tote our luggage on a bus during rush hour in an unknown city. After 2 hours of waiting, I took a cab. The shuttle never showed. To their credit, the manager did defuse the situation upon our arrival.

We booked our room on the premier level and to be honest it wasn't very premier like. The concierge lounge was supposed to have light snacks, coffee, teas, etc.. Well it didn't on the week end. The coffee machine in the lounge was without water and we had no way of filling it. For breakfast, there were exactly 2 croissants and 2 pastries available, a couple of boxes of cereal, and a small assortment of meats, yogurts, a bowl of fruit salad and juices. Nothing was out for the evening or late afternoon.

The room itself was clean and modern, but, the bed was a bit uncomfortable. I would have given this hotel an average rating under normal circumstances, but, because of the lack of amenities normally associated with a premium room and the ridiculous shuttle fiasco, it gets a poor rating. I would not stay here again.",2,2015,06,25
219,Just about okay! ,"Good things first : Location! Price! And of course the interiors. 
North Star hotel has a very impressive location in Dublin which is very near to the city centre, and an equally impressive interior with bright warm colours as it's decor. They also have rooms for families which is a brilliant thing. 
The brightly lit spacious room with attached balcony deserves brownie points in truest sense. The concierge services are good and they keep your luggage free of charge in their cloak room for quite some time. 
Now the list of things which obviously was a source huge disappointment during my stay, we were in room number 652, which has a view of other apartments, where you get to peek into someone's living room ( didn't enjoy that very much ) though they claim they have an air conditioner inside the room, it never worked for the three nights we were there, we had to keep the balcony door open for some fresh air but realised that since the balcony was common with the other rooms it wasn't exactly a very safe thing to keep the balcony door open at night. Upon complaining regarding their air conditioner, management did place a table fan in our room but it was just not comfortable inside the room, again a couple of incidents took place where the shower fittings just came off delaying our process of getting ready. A plumber came and fixed it within 5-10 minutes, their water pressure is minimal and the toiletries provided in the bathrooms just not good enough for a self proclaimed four star hotel. 
Also while checking in ( about 9:30 pm after a visit to Belfast ) for some reason the person behind the counter couldn't swipe my VISA card, I insisted that let me pay US dollars for the time being, to which he said no, I then insisted that it's really late and am feeling tired whether I can pay the next day to which he again said that he required the payment then and there, I had to walk out go to an ATM and get the full payment (which is fine)  but I think it's a little unfair because my card was working perfectly fine ( I withdrew cash from a nearby arm, also swiped it at a nearby store ) so there was some fault with their cash machine. 
So finally after the full payment I was allowed inside the room somewhere around 10:15 pm and after a very hectic day trip to Belfast. A little trust from the hotel people would be nice. 
The Internet connectivity also needs a special mention which keeps on getting disconnected now and then and when I had asked about it the receptionist just shrugged off her shoulders saying ""maybe there are 200 devices connected at the moment ,you have got to wait! ""
There's a shuttle service which can be absolved from the hotel to the airport which we had availed for 5 euros per person, it was nice and cheap and we reached within 20 minutes ( sans traffic ) 
The hotel is nice compared to the other hotels regarding it's price but I feel some of their staff ( not all ) actually needs to do a little bit of hospitality course if possible and I would definitely recommend other areas of Dublin to stay in if possible like Temple Bar area or City Centre, for people who can't walk, the ten minute walk to O'connel street from this hotel is difficult and taxis mostly overcharge or refuse to go because of the short distance. 
My stay wasn't up to the mark, but I am sure others opinion may differ. 

",3,2015,06,24
219,If you staying in Dublin this is the place to stay,"i would highly recommend this hotel. the room was very clean  comfotable bed great night sleep. friendly staff and very helpful, we had our evening meal at the hotel it was freshly cooked and very enjoyable, lovely breakfast in the morning looking forward to staying at this hotel again",5,2015,06,24
219,Perfect time ,"We spent the first three days and the last two days of our two week vacation at the North Star. The concier,Kieran(spelling) and staff were the most gracious I have ever experienced. The attention given to us was above and beyond just being polite. A genuine concern that  our time was well spent was evident. I have to recommend the most incredible person we met on our trip. Our cab driver Kerin. He drove us from Dublin to Port Rush, we stayed five days and we were picked up for the return to Dublin five minutes early. Kerin sang the song the Voyage to my mother and us. Kerin was a gentleman to all 8 of us. We found the song the Voyage, it brings a teary happy memory we will never forget. Thank you all for your hospiality. We will remember you all forever. It was truly a 5 star vacation. I could go on, but I would rather go back soon 

",5,2015,06,24
219,Would be great if... ,"if they would just care about the customer experience. I'm a tour guide, working dozens of days without a break. Hotels know that and yet they give you a room which is not acceptable. It's a great hotel with great staff and food, but if you need some time out, avoid. Just listen to the attached audio, with a view out of the bedroom's window. ",1,2015,06,23
219,"If you're going to be in Dublin, this is the place to stay!","The rooms were great. The beds very comfortable. The restaurant, before 10, first class.
The thing that makes me recommend the hotel so highly, however, is the staff. They were on the ball and so helpful. We were a of group of 8 from the states ages 12 - 81. They couldn't do enough for us. One thing that sticks out the most is the concierge. He was helpful beyond words. We were going to be traveling from Dublin to Portrush in Northern Ireland. We were planning on taking the train, not realizing we'd have to change train stations in Belfast with all our luggage and a wheelchair. He arranged for us to take a van cab from Dublin to Portrush at less that the cost (and hassle) of the trains. We had the best cab driver, Keiron. Kieron is a veritable encyclopedia of Ireland. He was so kind and even came back to Portrush to bring us back to the North Star in Dublin where we enjoyed even better accommodations the second time!  He and the North Star were unanimously two of our favorite things about the  whole trip. When I go back to Dublin I will be staying at the North Star on Amiens!",5,2015,06,22
219,"OK, Good Location, Needs Updating","This hotel is ok but not a 4-star or 5-star property today.

It is across from Connelly Station so if you have an early train it is very convenient. Feels a bit run down. The lift is up one floor from the lobby. No views. Breakfast was not included and was expensive so we ate elsewhere. Staff were friendly and helpful.

Given our itinerary and need for an early train, I would stay here again.

If this review is helpful then please indicate so below.",3,2015,06,22
219,Short stay,"Enjoyed an overnight stay at the North Star Hotel. Staff we encountered through out our stay were helpful and friendly. Room was spacious an clean and contained all you could possibly need. Only complaint  was the room was very warm, even though we had use of a fan. In fact the entire hotel was very warm. Food was excellent. Had a lovely lunch on arrival. Breakfast was equally delicious with an excellent choice of hot and cold options. I look forward to my next visit to The North Star and would recommend it to friends.",4,2015,06,21
219,Good but needs improvement for its price.,"The Hotel is in a good location just 5-10 minutes walk to ""the spire"" on O'CONNELL ST. The ferry transfer bus stopped directly opposite which was very convenient, it cost just 2.50 Euros. We got a taxi on our return to the ferry which cost 12 Euros. Great reception & restaurant area. The hallways and standard double rooms really do need updating. The room was noisy due to the large fans outside our window. The worst part of our stay was the temperature. It was very hot in our room, in the corridors, and in the breakfast room. Breakfast was pretty good but had to pay extra for it and wanted to finish asap due to the uncomfortable heat. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall it was an average stay but overpriced at ¬£85.",3,2015,06,21
219,Nice hotel,"There are several positives about the North Star Hotel.  First, the hotel is near public transport.  The 747 bus from the airport stops pretty much right outside.  It is a 2 minute walk to the Luas tram stop at Busares and is right across the street from the transport centre.  It is in a good location, not far from the financial district, O'Connell Street and doesn't take long to get to the tourist bits.  It is a fair distance to walk to places like The Guiness factory so would recommend the tram or some good walking shoes.  The hotel itself was decorated nicely, but you can still see the history under the decor.  

The staff were friendly upon arrival.  We had booked as a package and were not offered any free upgrade but for ‚Ç¨30 per night, we paid to change our room to premium.  The room was adequately sized and the bed was very comfy.  We had coffee making facilities in the room.  There wasn't too much else that jumped out as being ""premium"" about the room though.

The restaurant in the hotel is very nice and food was delicious.  All in all very good.

The negatives are the fact that every morning were we awoken at around 7 by doors slamming from others leaving their rooms.  The breakfast was okay, but not great.  We also had to put the Do Not Disturb sign out fairly early to avoid the cleaners coming in.  They seem to start very early too.  The premium lounge that was included in our upgrade was nicely decorated.  It offers an espresso machine, ""fancy"" water and biscuits.  Unfortunately no one was manning this room and the coffee machine was out of supplies when we went in.  Nothing that said premium upgrade in it! 

All in all, a good place to stay for 4 nights.  We weren't bowled over but, if a deal came up, would stay again.",4,2015,06,20
219,Great location but needs a facelift,"My family and I stayed two nights at the North Star hotel. It was advertised as a 4 star hotel with recent renovations. We booked a family room, for me, hubby and two teenagers and another room for two adults. 

The public areas of the hotel seem to have had a recent facelift and are in generally good condition. The staff are friendly and helpful. When we arrived, there was only one room ready so,we checked into the one just to have a place to put the bags. The housekeeper on our floor knew we were waiting for the room and made sure it was done quickly. 

Keith, the barman, in McGettigan's was very attentive and took great care of us during our stay. He was quick with our drink orders and was very knowledgeable about the menu. 

The rooms are spacious enough as we didn't expect anything large but they are terribly in need of a facelift. 
Our bathroom floor had cracked tiles which moved when stepped on and the shower was dingy and blackened. 
It was clean, just very old. 
The lighting in the bathroom was dark and made it difficult to apply makeup. I had to sit at the desk near the window. 
The room was also advertised as having a power shower which we absolutely did not have. 

The two single beds in the room were comfortable and my children were happy with them. However, the double bed was very lumpy and had a huge dip in the middle which caused me and my husband to tend to roll towards each other while trying to sleep. 

A few more shelves and drawers would have been helpful in storing our belongings. The night stands have no drawers, they are really little side tables. There are only two decent size drawers on the desk and the bottom one was broken. We had t all put everything on the top shelf of the closet. 

I think the oddest thing I encountered was the hair dryer. It had been placed in the desk drawer but because the plug was fixed, it could not be unplugged and moved to another plug. The cord was so short that it could only be used in a sitting position. 

We did enjoy the breakfast the one morning we chose to stay in. There was a wide variety of choices. Eggs, bacon, sausages, toast and potatoes were on the hot buffet. 
There was also fresh fruit, cereals, muesli, yogurt and juices available. 
Overall, the staff and service were great. I really wish the room had been just as nice. ",3,2015,06,18
219,Two night stay May 15,"Nearly opposit  the train station, local to shops, about 20 min walk to bar temple. Friendly, comfy and central. 
Breakfast lovely, lots to chose from.
Room ok, basic clean and modern.
Next to a restaraunt if you don't want to go far for food (we didn't eat there but looks lovely)
      ",4,2015,06,18
219,Great Hotel and Service,"I've stayed here on a couple of occasions and it is in an ideally location is travelling by train. 
Good sizes rooms. 
The breakfast is one of the best I have had from a hotel buffet breakfast, all plentiful and hot ",4,2015,06,17
219,Poor,"Booked through a lastminute website and thought we got a reasonable deal but. why it was on the site I do not know. Car parking was a nightmare and so small car keys have to be left with the attendant so we had to remove all our luggage from the vehicle.  Building is old so no elevator service from the lobby -  a real problem if you are carrying a load of luggage even if there is only a dozen or so steps. Must have been given the worst room in the place.  The bathroom was last updated in the 70s.   Receptionist so unfriendly she should look for a job in a prison! When called to ask for the wifi code which I needed urgently, she refused to tell me and twice directed me to the book in the room for a code as simple as  northstar55. Breakfast in the basement was fine. There are better cheaper hotels in better neighbourhoods with even better access to tourist attractions.",1,2015,06,16
219,Pleasant stay,"Stayed 2 nights at North Star as a special occasion with Mrs L. Room was fine: clean and with enough room but not spacious. Problem we had was that room / hotel was unbearably hot so fan was on most of the time we were there - not really possible to keep window open as our room was rather adjacent to the very noisy train station. Breakfast was fine - I don't normally like buffets as food can linger somewhat, but this had been looked after so was fine.",3,2015,06,14
219,Fantastic hotel,"Very nicely presented hotel with friendly staff who were very accommodating. Room was spacious with everything you would need, breakfast was a huge buffet of hot and cold food which was delicious. Couldn't recommend it more great value :)",5,2015,06,12
219,Great Location.Great breakfast.,"I atayed in the North Star Hotel on Fri 29th May and was delighted that it was located so close to the bus depot and City centre was within easy walking distance.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean and spacious. Breakfast the following morning was lovely with a wide choice of cereals, fruit and fruit juices, fresh breads and hot foods including pots of fresh coffee. Delicious! I will definitely stay again when I get a chance to fisit Dublin. ",4,2015,06,08
219,Fantastic Staff,"stayed last night at the North Star for one night only for a theatre break. The staff were great however our room was a little bit stuffy and there was a lot of noise very early in the morning.  I just wanted a toasted cheese sandwich for lunch when we arrived as we at 2.00 pm as we had booked early bird menu pre theatre, however I can only say I was given a loaf of bread (ciabatta) with cheese melted in the middle, it was the strangest toasted sandwich I ever had.  your food is great but you could really do with having some snacks on your lunch menu.

219,Very nice hotel with great service,"Stayed here in July 2014 with my girlfriend. The trip was a last minute city break and we were not disappointed. After sifting through plenty of hotels we came across the North Star and picked it due to how nice the rooms looked a long with a great location. Upon arrival we were greeted at the main reception and were immediately told of a free upgrade to a premier room along with 2 glasses of prosecco in the hotel restaurant. The room was fantastic, very spacious, clean and modern. We tried out the hotel restaurant on the first night and had a lovely steak which was rather expensive however very tasty. The second night we had a drink at the cocktail bar in the outside seating which had a great atmosphere and feel, which was a perfect start to our night. 

I highly recommend this hotel for its great location, wonderful service and very spacious and comfortable rooms. A great choice for a great city break.",4,2015,06,04
219,Quaint!,"Lovely rooms and hotel lobby: good size, clean, and quiet rooms.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Didn't eat at the hotel though so cannot comment on F&B.
Gym is really poor though: and that green carpet?!  Equipment is poor too.",4,2015,06,04
219,Could not have been happier,"We arrived to very pleasent staff.
Went to the room to find it was a suite we only paid ¬£214 for 2 nights for a double room which ended up being a double with a single as well really roomy with tv/hairdryer/free wifi and coffee etc.. The room had a sofa/longue area and a massive bathroom and walk in shower.

The bed was super comfortable to the extent it was hard to get out of in the mornings.

The bulb blew in the room and tripped the fuse and they were up repairing it within minutes, the hotel also printed all of our tour and bus tickets and were very accomodating.

We had room service pizza and also ate from the bar and grill attached on the staff there were lovely and the food and drinks were delicious and reasonably priced.

Overall we loved our stay and will definately be coming back (hoping we get the same room again)

The only issue was the heat in the rooms but the aircon soon solved that!",5,2015,06,04
219,Well pleased,Staff are just amazing could not do enough for us rooms were spotless and beds so comfy. Had a meal in the restaurant and the food was amazing. Great central location will definitely be back.highly recommend,5,2015,06,03
219,Excellent hotel within walking distance to city centre,"Stayed five nights at the Northstar Hotel in Dublin.  It was such a nice hotel within easy walking distance of Dublins main attractions.  We were upgraded to a suite which was perfect as we had been travelling around Europe for a month and the extra room was great.  The room we had was very spacious with fully renovated bathroom.  We ate at the hotels restaurant and bar 4 nights as it was such a great experience.  The bar and restaurant staff really made our stay very special.  Dominic, Zoe and David went out of their way to make our stay even more pleasant.  The food was very good also.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Northstar hotel.",5,2015,05,31
219,Nat bad but not 4 star,"Hotel was clean and comfortable. Was within walking distance of the city centre. We booked a classic room and when we arrived we were dissapointed with the room. The standard was of a 3 star Hotel. We upgraded our room in the end. The room was quite small. Television only had 5 channels which were not good at all. The room ameneties were ok.
On the first night we asked to have our two single beds joined together, but nobody in the hotel seemed to want to help. We had to do this ourselves. I then asked for a king size duvet as we had two single duvets, but the Hotel had apparently ran out of them. Odd for a four star Hotel? 
The Hotel has a nice restaurant which serves good food. We ate here twice. 
Overall, ok. The only saving grace for this Hotel is its location. There are probably better four star Hotels around Dublin.",3,2015,05,29
219,Perfection,It was our first ever stay at this hotel and from the moment we walked in we knew we had made the right choice. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful even ordered a cake for my husbands birthday. Breakfast was filling with plenty of choice. Evening meals in the restaurant was well cooked and presented well. Rooms were lovely plenty of space bed was very comfortable never wanted to get out . Room was cleaned daily . Thank you North star.,5,2015,05,29
219,Best Trip Ever,"Just arrived home after spending 9 glorious nights in Dublin at one of the nicest hotels I've had the opportunity to stay in.
From the moment of check-in to the time we left my husband and I were treated with care and kindness that helped make our holiday wonderful.
The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful in every way possible.
The Breakfast was a great way to start your day with many options to choose from and again wonderful staff to help you.
This hotel also has a restaurant /bar that serves wonderful meals or is also a place to have a pint or two. Sean(one of the bartenders) helped us find a church close to the hotel so I could attend Mass on Sunday morning.
The rooms were beautiful. I was so happy with the attention to detail and the cleanliness that was reflected in the rooms and throughout the hotel.
I want to also give a special shout out to Diana who went above and beyond to help make this stay so fantastic and making this a home away from home.
Also hello to Thomas who was always asking how he could make our stay more enjoyable and asking how to improve for the future.
When I come back I wouldn't think about staying anywhere else.
Keep up the good work.",5,2015,05,29
219,Long Spring weekend,"Stayed for 4 nights in April. The room was very spacious and all the facilities were excellent. I was given a room facing onto the main street however i never heard any noise either from the traffic nor the trains passing nearby. The breakfast was excellent although the breakfast room did take a bit of finding being hidden away in the basement.
The bar was very nice and drinks prices were reasonable. I did not have a meal in the hotel but did think the bar food menu looked good. The hotel is great for transport links, the bus from the airport stops just across the road and a tram stop is only 50yds away. The railway station is also just across the road. The hotel also provides a shuttle service to and from the airport for 5 euros each way.
In summary, this hotel was idea for my visit and will certainly consider it again for my next visit. .",4,2015,05,28
219,Great location,"Stayed for four nights, great rooms and facilities near to CBD and walking distance to most attractions staff very pleasant and helpful would recommend to anyone making a visit to Dublin. Public transport right outside front door as well. ",4,2015,05,27
219,Allright,"This is a basic property, old, but coddled so as to appeal to the average traveler...
There was a smell of old people in the lobby, but that was likely due to the old people in the lobby. It seems a place for large tourist buses to drop off their groups. My room was a lower level with a view into my room from the street,so you can imagine that I was not impressed. It may be that the other rooms are nicer with better views...likely the upper floors ae nicer.
The best thing about the hotel was the decent breakfast included...a fulll Irish. They had a pancake machine (?) that I did not try but was fascinated with. Fresh fruits, coffee, tea, beanie weenies, tomato, eggs two ways, toast, jams, porridge....sausage, bacon, cereals, croissant...I needed a nap after breakfast.
Location is allright...near the Customs House. I like to walk so that wasn't a problem. 
The property has a restaurant attached and the lamb was very very good. But, then again, Dublin has no lack of awesome pubs and good food. There is a Quick mart right on the corner and that's handy for travelers. Also transport is across the street. So, all in all, a decent location with amenities at hand.
Booking through Amoma is magical...all is done in advance. Easiest check in and checkout ever! Hooray for that....

219,Lots of character,Eight friends went to Dublin for a weekend and had a great stay in the North Star Hotel. Really full of character. Staff really helpful bar and restaurant served good food for a reasonable price. Beer garden under the railway arch is a lovely place to spend some time.,5,2015,05,26
219,My stay,We stayed in the north star hotel last march a family room. we went to a show had a fantastic stay staff was s friendly would recomend it and would stay there again. The menu was great and the hoteld itself was lovely.,5,2015,05,24
219,A little Gem,"We stayed here with friends through a ""Secret Location Unnamed"" deal,  we were more that pleasantly surprised, the location was perfect for exploring Dublin.  Our room was clean, tidy, quiet, with tea and coffee facilities, tv, hairdryer etc, which, in fairness, is probably what you would expect from a four star hotel, fresh towels daily, lotions and shampoos etc in the bathroom.   It was 10 minute walk from the Town centre, with nearby tram station, which we did not hear at all. Buses also run close by. 

There is a Residents lounge which no one seemed to use, it was quiet and comfortable, we used to sit and have a chat after our days out and make arrangements for our evenings.

The staff were very helpful supplying maps and information.  Wi-fi through the hotel. There is a restaurant where you can eat a nice meal, breakfast is eaten downstairs, there is also an excellent gym, a shuttle service to the airport I would highly recommend this Hotel for your visit",5,2015,05,23
219,Excellent Hotel,"Hotel perfectly situated for travel purposes. One of the main train stations on the opposite side of the road with the bus station a very short walk away. Rooms quite spacious and very comfortable. The restaurant/bar area is not confined to  hotel guests so can become quite noisy in the evening. Otherwise this is an excellent hotel and I would have no hesitation in recommending

219,Boutique Hotel near Bus/Train Station!,"We stayed two nights while on a tour of Ireland.  Very nice boutique hotel.  It is a big dated and could stand a renovation to update it.  But everything was very clean.  Staff were friendly and helpful, giving us information as to where to find dinner (as most restaurants on a Tuesday night in the area had closed).  Check in was super easy.  There is an elevator, but you have to go up about 8 steps ‚Äì so carrying large pieces of luggage was a big of a struggle after a day of travel.  The room was pretty nice ‚Äì and the bathroom was really clean too.  We didn‚Äôt have much a view.  No worries as we were very tired in the evening and didn‚Äôt spend much time in our hotel room.  The bed was comfortable.  Our only complaint would be the shower head was very low ‚Äì so my husband had a bit of trouble bending down.  I on the other hand had trouble getting in and out of the shower as the tub is very deep and getting out, it was a bit of a step.  Great wifi.",4,2015,05,21
219,Not bad at all!,"I stayed here for 4 nights recently with work. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially the supervisor over breakfast. Check in was quick and uncomplicated. Room was nice, but the view was terrible, as I was ground floor, and my view was of air conditioning pipes, and the street. Bed was comfortable, and wifi was fast. However the bathroom was slightly old fashioned. The flush on the toilet was weak, and the shower pressure was also quite weak, but when i brought this to their attention, it was dealt with quickly. Breakfast was fine, but not stand out. The evening food from the room service menu however, was lovely, and treasonably priced. Parking is plentiful, and is looked after by a 24 hour attendant, and is ‚Ç¨8 per night. I would gladly stay again if attending something in the city centre, but would like to book the upgrade room next time to see how much of a difference it would make to my stay.",4,2015,05,20
219,We'd come back and stay again,This hotel was part of a fly drive package we bought from Aer Lingus. Three of us stayed in the room and found it quite comfortable and clean. We ate dinner in the bar area and really enjoyed the reasonably priced food. In fact my cousin who lives locally joined us there as well. The bar itself was fine. We saw many locals stopping in for a drink or meal. We walked to Temple Bar and the Guinness brewery from here. Parking is adjacent to the hotel. Front desk personnel were very friendly and accommodating calling a cab and allowing me to use the phone to make local calls.,5,2015,05,19
219,A good place to stay in Dublin ,"Although it is located north of the Liffey, this hotel is opposite Connolly Station and just a short walk to the Temple Bar area, Trinity College and O' Connell Street.  
The standard suite was very comfortable and the full breakfast set you up for the day.  The hotel staff were both polite and helpful.  ",4,2015,05,19
219,Okay,"Booked it for a decent price for a twin room for three nights with my friend and relatively close proximity to city centre, it only takes about ten minute walk to get there. Nice clean room, modern decor. Clean bathroom, fast check-in. Wifi working all the time which was great.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest negatives was a very uncomfortable bed, too high, too soft and too wobbly. As I turned on my bed, the whole bed wobbled along, I was afraid my mattress would slide off the bed. Also, the duvet was uncomfortably tucked at the foot of the bed between bed and mattress and really hard to pull out, one of my pet peeves. After pulling it out I've realized the duvet linen is not closed on the bottom and the duvet itself is sticking out a bit. It's sad, I would have loved to give it a better review, but the hotels I always remember most fondly are those with super comfortable beds in which only a couple of hours of sleep make you refreshed and bright. This was not it.
 
It's slightly complicated to navigate the whole building, quite a long walk from reception to the lift and then to my room on 7th floor. Also, for about 130 euros per night, one would expect breakfast included in the room rate, but this was not the case. I took it the first morning, which I spent alone (my friend only arrived the second evening) and stressed couple of times to the seater that it will only be me taking breakfast, i.e. one person. But of course, I've been billed too and had to tell it to reception staff at the check out. Fortunately it wasn't a problem. Also, no minibar present.

Overall an okay stay, pleasant staff and great on-site restaurant. I only wished they had better beds.",3,2015,05,19
219,Friends Birthday celebration,"3 adults in a triple room. Room was very clean and spacious.
Hotels customer service very good, when we arrived we received complimentary drinks and balloons to wish my friend  Happy Birthday, much appreciated, many thanks.
Breakfast is very good, all piping hot, lots of variety, cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, full Irish.
This is our 2nd time staying at the hotel and it probably won't be our last.
Many thanks again",5,2015,05,18
219,GREAT FOUR DAY BREAK,Visited Dublin for the first time and stayed at the North Star.It was a great choice the staff are so friendly and helpful.Everything clean and tidy nice restaurent and bar area and the breakfast offers great choice both hot and continental.Very well  equipped gym area to get rid of the excesses that Dublin has to offer.Nice room with large comfy bed.Will return .,5,2015,05,18
219,"nice hotel, a little bit away from downtown","this was a great find for us! it's a little bit away from the touristy area of Dublin, but right near the bus station and a train station which helped us get around. the room was nice, super comfortable beds! the floor creaked like crazy when you walked on it, i felt bad for the people below us. we were looking forward to the breakfast that was included with your room, but we never seemed to make it out of our room in time to eat it. and while we had a coupon for a free glass of Prosecco for the restaurant, if you ordered food, we just found too many great places in town to eat at to ever want to eat at the hotel restaurant. i would recommend it.  maybe a little pricey for some, but it was clean, the staff was helpful and for most, i'm sure that the free breakfast and free wi-fi is a hugh plus!",4,2015,05,17
219,I'll be back,"Took my mum for her 70th birthday and stayed in a twin room. 

The location of the hotel is very good. It's about a twenty minute walk to the main bits, like temple bar and has a taxi rank outside. The hotel also provide a ‚Ç¨5 shuttle service that takes you directly to and from the airport. The hotel is in the business area of Dublin, it's central but not noisy and you can get a good nights sleep.

The hotel itself is impressive, beautiful decor and furnishings, beautiful. The rooms are very nice. We had a problem with our heating and Luka came immediately, apologised and sorted it straight away. Our room was one of the ones were the bathroom has not being updated, it was clean just not so pretty with orange tiles.

On the evening, me and my mum went for a drink in the bar, Aoife and John, the waitress/bar staff had recognised it was my mums birthday and brought us over a free glass of prosecco each. What a lovely gesture. The food was great.",5,2015,05,15
219,Clean Hotel Near Dowtown,"Just finished a two night stay at the North Star Hotel. The hotel itself was clean and comfortable. Accidentally left some jewelry and a few other things out during the day that at other hotels probably would have gone missing but I was pleasantly surprised to find them set neatly on the freshly made bed. The room was a bit on the small side but that was to be expected. 
The restaurant downstairs was delicious! Noticed a lot of local people in for a quick bite and a pint, which is always a good sign. 
Only issue we had was the impression the check in desk gave us. It was our very first time at their hotel, let alone in Ireland and they were extremely curt. Locals on the street were so friendly and helpful yet the hotel staff turned up their nose and made us feel like ""dumb"" Americans. **STEAR CLEAR OF THE CHECK IN DESK & DEFINITELY DONT ASK ANY QUESTIONS!**
That aside my friend and I both agreed we would stay again because the location was within walking distance of everything we wanted to do while in Dublin. Just don't go out and walk around after dark... The neighborhood didn't have the safest vibe after the sun went down!",4,2015,05,14
219,"Central for city, 3 arena, Croke Park","Had a great stay last weekend. Premier room well appointed, very clean (bathrobe, slippers, safe, fridge, plenty of drawers etc) , bathroom excellent (marble & quality fittings). Bed superbly comfortable and king size.
McGettigan's Bar, reasonable prices, skillet of fish superb, wife's issue dealt with straightaway (with a smile), breakfasts good choice.
Bonus for premier rooms of a Premier Lounge on top floor which provides a complimentary continental breakfast on midweek days -not Sat/Sun (great if like us you just like cereals/muesli/ yoghurt & fresh fruit) plus a view over the roof tops.
Transport links - Connolly railway station -100yds, Tram opposite, 747 bus from airport 10euro return (every 15mins), or hotel Paddywagon same price.
One problem solved by Ops manager Colm again with a smile. Thank You.
Handy for walking back into city (10mins O'Connell St) or catch tram direct to 3 arena.
Gym aerobic well equipped.
Will stay again.",4,2015,05,12
219,Leisure break,"Great location and across from the train station. Rooms spacious and lovely breakfast each morning. Nice bar but had no entertainment at night, maybe as we stayed mid week this was the reason but will return again when we are in dublin.
              ",5,2015,05,12
219,great hotel--great staff,"stayed at the Northstar again a few weeks ago (had stayed there in 2013). rooms are great, good restaurant, excellent breakfasts,  a genuinely-short walk to the centre of Dublin; a Laundromat two minutes walk away where a bag of washing can be dropped in and picked up later in the day, washed and folded, at a very reasonable price. I realised, while on a plane about to leave Dublin Airport for London, that I had left an important personal item in the room. a phone call to the Northstar, and an email for their records, had the item in my hands, the following morning by courier, at our London hotel--wonderful service. Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,12
219,Girly break,"Lovely hotel located by Cononley station,  decor throughout is modern and very clean. Greeted at reception for an early check in our room was ready and our bags carried to our room which was appreciated. Stayed in room 203 facing the street wasn't noisy at all. The room was spotlessly clean and stocked with tea coffee etc iron and board and hairdryer. Bathroom was big with a great shower and stocked toiletries if required. Cannot find fault at all with this hotel big thanks to Kieran at the concierge desk full of knowledge and will go out of his way to help you. Bar area is lovely and priced on par with the rest of Dublin.  Breakfast was fab so much to choose from and served till 11 am at the weekend . Would highly recommend this hotel x",5,2015,05,10
219,Lovely hotel,Really nice hotel. Easy to get to when get airport shuttle bus. Just be aware that round the corner is the polish capital of the world. Rooms are nice but very warm at night. Use the air con. Within walking distance of most tourist places. Would stay again.,4,2015,05,09
219,Nicest place we've stayed so far,"We stayed one night here at the end of a tour. Paid the extra 30 euros to upgrade to club. It was well worth it. Staff were friendly and helpful with information about the area. Breakfast was great with offerings for everyone. After staying in tiny flats in London it was wonderful to have some space and amenities. We were able to print out boarding passes for the next day, and enjoyed dessert and Irish coffee in the restaurant. Would stay here again any time.",5,2015,05,09
219,What a lovely hotel!,"I have stayed at this hotel for 6 night and I did have a great time, absolutely perfect. The room was very big and clean, the staff where very helpful and the location perfect, most attractions are just a short walk away. A big thank you to all the members of the staff from the North Star hotel for making my stay so pleasant !",5,2015,05,06
219,Great Hotel,I've been to Dublin many times in the past 3 years and the North Star is the best hotel I have sayed in. The room was lovely and clean and the breakfast couldn't have been better! What more do you want?,5,2015,05,06
219,Enjoyable weekend break,"Just back from our second visit to the lovely North Star, comfortable rooms and great staff, big shout out to the lads in the bar, particularly Paddy who share stories of his travels and was a joy to speak to,
Great breakfast and location, looking forward to visiting in the not too distant future.",5,2015,05,04
219,Nice hotel but...,"Okay, so first of all, the room was nice, the hotel has been renovated and is nicely laid out, breakfast was yummy and I'm sure the restaurant food was as well. The problem was probably the maid service.
I stayed recently and in one of the drawers we found empty boxes of hair colour. Some stains were on the blanket, and a chair and apparently the carpet too. The bath was a bit discolored too. This was what me and my partner found when checking in. Anyway, we dont make trouble and we had lots planned so we put them in the bin. The few marks didnt bother us, everything else was clean, the previous guests must have thought it was a great idea to dye their hair in a hotel room. Maybe the stuff stains really bad. Anyway we had a comfy nights stay, checked out and all was fine. 
Today I get an email from someone at the hotel asking me to contact them to pay for the damage which I didnt do. So the maids probably didnt report anything after cleaning before we arrived, and then it looks like it was me and I need to go back to the hotel and pay even though I'm about to leave for a business trip.
So yeah, good hotel, maybe some tired maids that caused this misunderstanding, whatever. I was considering staying here again but now I think I'll stick with a place with a more friendly management who dont just send me an email and demand I pay.",1,2015,05,02
219,Fanastic Stay. Will Be back,"My partner and I stayed at the North Star for 2 weeks in April and everything about our stay was exceptional. The North Star is in a great location -  a short walk to O'Connell Street (main street), close to the Luas (tram/light rail), and across the road from Connolly Train Station. With trains moving very slowly as they approach/depart the station, there was barely any noise from the trains. We stayed in a Premier Club King room which was spacious, spotless and had a very comfortable bed. Overall the hotel was very clean and charming. All staff were very friendly and attentive with special thanks to Linda who arranged our booking and who, along with Kieran, suggested some wonderful and interesting sites to visit. We had a few drinks and meals in the restaurant/bar McGettigans and thoroughly enjoyed each visit. After a long day out walking and seeing the sites it's wonderful to come 'home' to a pint, warm delicious meal and comfy bed. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2015,05,01
219,excellent hotel,"This hotel is exceptionally clean. The staff were without exception friendly and helpful. 
Our room was a large twin room and had everything you would need. It was well heated. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. 
This is the second time I have stayed in the hotel and I would highly recommend it.
Breakfast offers a wide and varied choice.",5,2015,05,01
219,Excellent base in Dublin,"The hotel was ideally located - 5 minute walk from O'Connell St.
It has recently been tastefully refurbished. The whole hotel was clean, fresh and a joy to stay in. Bedroom was enormous and had everything in it that you could want.
Hotel staff very pleasant, helpful and friendly.
The bar of the hotel was brilliant - not what you normally expect in a hotel!!!
We ate in there our first night and the quality, and cost of the food, was amazing. Drinks were almost half the price of a bars in Temple Bar!!!!
Breakfast was that good that we didn't feel hungry until it was time for our evening meal!
Would definitely recommend staying at this hotel, and we will be returning to it again!!

",5,2015,05,01
219,Outstanding ,"I stayed at the North Star hotel for one night and it was fantastic, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, the rooms were average sized with extremely comfortable beds and a TV. The wifi at the hotel was free and worked fantastically for me and my party. Breakfast... I could go into detail but let's just say it was absolutely magnificent. They had a wide choice of food to choose from and had many different cereals as well as the usual fry up. The service at the North Star was also fantastic they were polite and always smiling. I would definitely recommend for everyone to stay here. ",5,2015,04,30
219,Birthday trip,Hotel centrally placed for tram connections and walking distance to O Connell St. Excellent evening meal in restaurant and good breakfasts. However train running immediately behind room was disturbing and no heat in bedroom on chilly weekend was uncomfortable. But we were supplied with a heater after informing Reception. ,3,2015,04,30
219,Great trip and location.,"Recently stayed in The North Star for shopping and a trip to rte. Location is great no need for buses or luas. At the edge of town so not too noisy. 

Check in was ok. However there was a mix up.. we booked a deal on the hotels site 2 nights with full irish, 3 course meal, robes in the room and premier king room, yet at reception no one mentioned it apparently it wasn't on their system which is not the fault of hotel or staff . 
But when I went down to find out why I had none of this stuff staff looked at me as if I was making this up. Eventually after calling the manager we were told breakfast was sorted and we got a dinner voucher. Still no robes its only a small issue but if your going to offer something it should be provided.

Room was a good size this was a king room. Bath tub and shower. Room and bathroom was spotlessly clean. Wifi available in the room. Flat screen tv however I have never stayed in a hotel before where you have to pay for tv ? This didn't affect my stay since there was plenty of things to do around dublin city. 

Breakfast was excellent! Staff were very friendly great choice of hot food and continental. Both morning breakfast was relaxing and enjoyable.

Fine sized gym and sauna, we didn't use it since we were having more of a lazy trip worth a trip.

The restaurant was amazing food was great, staff really went out of there way to make sure we got everything we wanted. Well worth a meal .

Overall other than the way the mix up was handled by staff this hotel was great! Would stay here again.",3,2015,04,30
219,Great Hotel,"Nice hotel, good location, very good premier rooms, simple and very tasty food in the bar, legendary breakfast, great service, staff very helpful and customer orientated,  Good value accommodation for a Dublin hotel. Overall experience exceeded expectations.",5,2015,04,27
219,OK for a sleep,"We needed a room for one night in Dublin and managed to get the North Star where we have stayed many times before.  The staff are all wonderful and very helpful and friendly.  The room was very clean but totally devoid of any features.  It was dark, and the one window was absolutely filthy and did not close properly.  The hotel is like an oven and the common areas are hotter than Hades.  An OK hotel but I would not want to stay for more than one night.",3,2015,04,27
219,Business trip,Very close to downtown in an excellent position for a visit of Dublin. Staff is very efficient and friendly. Breakfast is quite good in quality and quantity. Restaurant located beside the hotel is an excellent solution if you don't want to go downtown. Ratio quality/ price is good. Hope to to Dublin for holidays and will go in North Star Hotel for sure. My room  (566) was big and clean  (bathroom little bit too small ). Minibar fridge was empty and you have to manage by yourself.,5,2015,04,26
219,Really lovely hotel,"Visited Dublin in February and stayed in The North Star. Really lovely hotel and staff.  Breakfast good and room well presented.

We arrived early and we're able to check in at 8:30 am which was great considering many hotels won't allow this. Additionally we had an early flight on the last day and the hotel arranged an early takeaway breakfast which was nice.   

I would recommend it for anyone staying in Dublin.",4,2015,04,26
219,In Dublin's Fair City.......,"4 day break just after St Patrick's Day  found us at this hotel, conveniently located a 10 minutes window shopping stroll from O'Connell Street the main thoroughfare in Dublin.

The hotel itself has an unpretentious facade which hides  a veritable tardis-like interior which covers 7 floors and is a startling mix of Georgian splendour and modernity

We were in one of the Premier Club Rooms on the top floor and pleased to say that the lifts were always available and never crowded.

The staff were helpful and courteous throughout and  buffet style breakfast really set you up for the day.

If you want a good location close to the heart of the city, a bit of character and luxury then this is the hotel for you.",4,2015,04,25
219,Short break,"We came to the for a weekend break. The hotel from the outside look like any other building on the street. Inside nice and clean reception decorated in an old fashion way with a beautiful staircase give us a feeling of a long traditions of that place. We stayed in the Georgian wing. Room was nice and cosy larger then we expected for a standard and with very clean. There was no lift but as that part of the hotel is a listed structure we didn't complain. The hotel is old and new combine. There are a lot of nice areas to chill out. Well equipped gym with saunas and great back garden under railway arch. Dinner in the bar/restaurant exuded our expectations. Food was made to order and it was delicious for a reasonable price, we head ribs in size of a chopping board and a fish and chips. Breakfast was overwhelming and just as it should be. All staff seams to be happy and very professional. Great stay. We definitely gonna be back.",5,2015,04,22
219,Good Hotel,"Within walking to all the tourist areas, very clean hotel with a good breakfast. Staff very friendly and helpful. food and drink very reasonable and of a good quality. Would stay again if visiting Dublin. ",4,2015,04,20
219,"If you love friendly staff members and people in general, stay here!","Hotel are situated a little outside city centre, but gives you a nice walking distance to and from Temple Bar district.
Very friendly staff, and a decent local pub withing hotell premises.
If you thinking of seeing moore of Ireland, you are situated close to bus and train, and a great base for this 1 day trips out of town.",5,2015,04,20
219,Not Bad. Not Great. Just all right.,"On the positive side, we were able to check in far ahead of normal check-in hours (about 0630), which allowed us to nap after our extensive travel-time from Denver. The staff was helpful and friendly. The attached restaurant, McGettigans was absolutely delicious and their bartender was gregarious and funny.

On the negative, parking is not clearly identified (it is accessed through the alley in an unmarked corner of a cul-de-sac), and you have to check in before you have access to the garage in spite of the fact that the hotel has nowhere to park your car WHILE checking in (it is located on a busy main street with no pull-up area out front). As a result, we ended up paying for parking at the Connolly Station lot about a block away and schlepping our luggage to the hotel. Not a big deal, I suppose, but kind of annoying. The included breakfast was mediocre and the tea tasted like bathwater (must be the old pipes?).

Neutral factors: the room was passable. Not nice. Not bad. There is no elevator in the front section of the hotel, so you have to lug your bags up a full flight of stairs before you have elevator access (does the historic nature of the hotel exempt them from accessibility laws?). Regardless, the older parts of the hotel are quite charming from aesthetic standpoint, but from a practical standpoint...",3,2015,04,19
219,Not very helpfull,I left an expensive charger behind me in room 103 i was told that it wasn.t found but  i know it was left.i emailed management but they said on trip adviser that postage arrangements had been made to show people how good they make their selfs out to be it was pure lies no charger and no postage arranged .and havn.t heard back from them .place is ok but room we got to near road and you have to pay to park which is a joke.if management want to rimg me do on 07709614094 instead of putting vibbs on tripadviser,3,2015,04,19
219,"Good standard hotel, a touch further out than we would have liked","We enjoyed our stay in the North Star, staff friendly and helpful, rooms clean and comfortable, that said the bathroom was somewhat dated and in need of an upgrade.   I think that generally the rooms need a refurbishment programme and until this is done, it struggles to meet 4 star accommodation.  It  was just a bit further from the centre that we had anticipated, but not ridiculously so.  Despite the fact that this hotel is in close proximity to O'Connell station, you would never know once in side the hotel, never heard the murmur of a train.  Breakfast good, and McGettigans restaurant, part of the hotel, excellent.",4,2015,04,19
219,Unfortunately not a 4 star hotel bedroom,"The location of this hotel was fine but not central. The lobby area is lovely, staff extremely helpful and friendly. Our room was OK (2nd floor, family room) with the necessary amenities however did not meet our expectations of a 4 star hotel. The shower didn't work properly and the room needs updating and a proper clean. The hotel restaurant was amazing, I would definitely recommend eating there.",3,2015,04,18
219,CHOOSE YOUR ROOM CAREFULLY!,"The Aer Lingus Vacation Store failed to specify that this hotel has two sections: a very, very old section with remodeled bathrooms, and a much more modern section for a higher rate. Of course, Aer Lingus put us in the ""old"" section.   Beware: the ""old building"" does not have lifts and you will be schlepping yourself and your bags up many, many creaky staircases. The ""old"" section also has many noise issues with busy streets and rail tracks.  The ""newer"" section does not.

 Additionally, you should be aware that Dublin is divided (by a river) into Northern and Southern sections.  This hotel is in the far LESS desirable Northern section where is can be unnerving to walk at night.",2,2015,04,16
219,Not 4 star,"Good reception and offered to take my suitcase to the room up a number of floors and I walk with a stick- no lift
Its very close to the actual trains
Had an odd ticking right out side the room
Room was averagely furnished - the bathroom was clean but the bath doesnt drain
Felt a bit let down against my expectations",3,2015,04,15
219,Luxury upgrade !!!!,"We stayed here in on St. Patricks Day last year paid for a triple room and go upgraded to a two bedroom suite, helpful staff beautiful decor clean and quiet given its location, situated opposite Connolly train station, less than a 10 minute walk from O'Connell Street, be wary if walking to hotel late at night and i don't want this to tarnish the hotel but the area can have rough characters hanging around, as i am from Dublin and know the area i was confident to do the walk after midnight myself with 2 children (after a concert) so dont be put off but do be vigilant.",5,2015,04,14
219,A perfect break!!,"Having visited The North Star for four days in April 2015, me and my boyfriend have already decided we are coming back ASAP!! 

The hotel offers excellent service all round and amazing food in the Mc Gettingans Cookhouse restaurant- the steak was delicious. 

The hotel is within walking distance of temple bar and dead opposite Connelly station so wherever you want to be in Dublin, it is easy enough to get to. 

The staff are all friendly and very very  helpful- remembering to keep the guiness flowing (John in the bar is fab). 

We absolutely loved our stay here and will recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting the gorgeous Dublin City.",5,2015,04,14
219,Very good hotel,"I stayed here in March and it was a really good hotel to stay in. I could get a bit nosy at times as the train station is just across the road. The Luas station is about 2 minutes walk away and this takes you to the main attractions in Dublin. However it was about 15-20 minutes walk away from crooke park and about 15 minutes walk to temple bar and all of the shops. The rooms were very big, clean and comfortable.",4,2015,04,12
219,They dont bother replying to emails,I left an expensive charger behind me at this hotel i emailed  them twice for a return of charger but no reply they just want your money in dublin and forget about wanting them to help out.hotel was nice but dont get a room at the front as its to noisey near the road .its a handy hotel near train and bus depot,3,2015,04,12
219,Spacious rooms great value,"Large, spacious, comfortable, well appointed rooms. Clean, close to train and tram. Not in the city centre but within walking distance to city. Great in house bar/restaurant. Good value. Happy to recommend.",4,2015,04,11
219,Great location with friendly staff,"We stayed in this conveniently located Dublin hotel for two nights. From the outset we experienced excellent service. Arriving early from the airport, and well before the check-in time, the receptionist apologised that only one of our rooms was available. He had upgraded this room to a room with balcony overlooking the city and railway line. This was an unexpected bonus which set the tone for our stay. Our second room was available on our return from the shops. Both rooms were excellent,  our three teenage children enjoying their own space. Breakfast was very good, again with friendly and efficient service in the restaurant. Good choice of cereals, fruit and juices. The cooked breakfast was very nice, the only issue was the cool temperature of the food. We did not find the need to complain as the quality of the food was excellent. This is something easily rectified by hotel management. Our children enjoyed room service on the second night. This was very prompt and good quality.
The end of our stay was enhanced by the reception staff keeping our luggage until it was time to travel to the airport.  We would definitely stay here again. Great location, service and staff.",5,2015,04,11
219,Any negative comments should be ignored!,"Thanks must be sincerely given to all the staff at The North Star Hotel. Truly, a lovelier and more professional group of people couldn't be found anywhere. They go out of their way to please and accommodate: after making a complaint about the noise we experienced in our room, the lovely and understanding Maria (Bumbu?) on reception went all out, upgrading us to one of the hotel's best rooms. This made our trip to Dublin even more enjoyable and special. 

The furnishings in and around the rooms and hotel itself are plush, opulent and beautiful, impressing visitors from the moment you walk through the door. 

The only downside to the hotel is its proximity to the train line; however, the trade off is that you're incredibly close to the LUAS and all public transport types, via which navigation around Dublin is made simple and convenient- a very positive factor. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone; indeed, my son and his girlfriend intend to make the trip at Christmas! 

Thank you, North Star Hotel for a trip that was memorable for all the right reasons!",5,2015,04,09
219,Great Hotel 5 mins walk from city centre ,"What a great hotel, went with my partner for a few nights and it was our first time in Dublin, the hotel was clean and perfectly situated, staff were all helpful and friendly (special mention to the bar staff, especially Paddy) and the hotel had all the basic little extras that make a trip so much easier (free wi-fi, safe, ironing board etc) We are planning another trip to Dublin in a few months and will definetly be looking to stay at the North Star again.",5,2015,04,09
219,As good as it can be in a marginal spot,"The staff and  management could not be more friendly and accommodating. We felt like visiting royalty at every turn. Breakfast is amazing.  There is an attached (newly opened?) restaurant which is also  quite good .  The bad news is the location , a little seedy, across from the train  station.  The building is funky, there is a lift, but there are two sets of steps, about12 steps total, to get into  lobby reception.  Quite awkward with roller bags.  Porters are promplty  available,but they cannot even use trolleys because of all the steps.  Rooms can be noisy from trains, but we were OK with  that.  The negatives cannot go away, because they are due to location and awkward architecture .  The staff more than makes up for it in attentive treatment.",4,2015,04,08
219,Pleasantly surprised,After reading the reviews I was nervous about staying here. We had booked via Last Minute and this was a Top Secret deal. The hotel does look like a bit rundown from the outside but it's on a main road that never stops so unless they go out and power hose the front of it every hour there isn't a lot can be done about that but don't let this put you off. Inside was lovely. Very clean and quite a big room. We had a suite room 170. We slept soundly and really had no issues at all. We didn't eat so we didn't have the full hotel experience which is why I am only giving it 4. I would have no hesitation in staying here again. ,4,2015,04,08
219,"Central location, lovely hotel","This hotel is superb value for money.  It is in a great location, minutes away from bus and train station, 10 minutes walk to O'Connell street and 15-20 minutes to 3 arena.  Hotel rooms are modern, clean and large for city hotels.  One thing I liked was that there were two pillows on the single beds -a small detail but rarely seen in other hotels. Staff were all very friendly.  Will be my go to hotel when I go to Dublin.  Have already recommended it to all my friends and family.",5,2015,04,07
219,The most amazing hotel.,"Could not recommend this hotel any more, it was perfect :) 

We were able to check in to our room at 9am, with a complimentary upgrade to a premier room which was absolutely gorgeous, the most comfy bed! Access to premier lounge so we were able to get free hot drinks and water throughout the day. Complimentary prosecco with our meal in the restaurant. Brilliant continental, and my partner really enjoyed the full irish breakfast. Lovely staff, very very helpful. Restaurant with the beer garden was fantastic and not too expensive like some of the restaurants in Dublin. Very central, close to the Luas (tram), buses, trains - also a short walk to centre with lots of bars, shops, restaurants on the way! Beautifully decorated, every where you go its wonderful to look at. Of course very clean too.

All this may I add, with a brilliant price!

This hotel made our stay absolutely amazing, I couldn't recommend it more and I don't have a bad word to say about it.

Thank you North Star, when I come to Dublin I know where I'll be coming :)",5,2015,04,06
219,"Friendly staff, great location!","The hotel is literally right across the road from Connelly station which is very handy if you need to use the DART or get the train elsewhere. It is also only a short walking distance from Temple bar and Grafton street, roughly 10 minutes. 

The hotel itself has a nice reception area and the bar/restaurant is very nice. We found the staff in the bar were very nice and good craic.

The rooms were quite basic but they were clean and provided all the necessary facilities including a safe and ironing board with an iron. 

The hotel has decent WIFI and we got good signal in our room and had no problems connecting. 

All in all a good stay and a nice hotel in Dublin.",4,2015,04,02
219,Best hotel so far.,"Super clean, compfy, safe. Staff are so nice and everything is just round a corner, shops, takeaways, restaurants. Will defo be returning next year. The food was georgeous as were the room, which you could chose if you wanted it cleaning everyday.",5,2015,04,02
219,Nice clean room,"My wife and I stayed at the North Star hotel recently.  We found the rooms to be clean and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful in arranging tours, taxis, and reservations for restaurants.  The hotel is within walking distance of the main part of the Dublin.  The breakfast though not free was adequate.  In addition, they have a restaurant that serves a nice dinner.  All in all we had a pleasant visit and would stay there again.",4,2015,04,01
219,Education visit with student's,Just returned from group trip with student's.  The location is very good and close to transport links.  The hotel facilities are good and the breakfast was excellent.  Best of all was the staff customer care; it was outstanding.  Thanks for a great stay!,5,2015,04,01
219,excellent staff,"We arrived very early but they stashed our luggage so that we could get out and see Dublin right away. When we asked about nearby music shops, a kind woman at the front desk got out a map for us and put dots on the locations of all the music shops in the city- so helpful (said her ex was a musician, so she knew them all!). The breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff there was also very nice. Rooms were comfortable and the location was convenient.",5,2015,03,31
219,service and comfort.,"We have stayed at the hotel a few times but nothing prepared us for the attentioned we got this time.from the moment we got there the attention my wife got was fantastic,she was in a wheelchair and they could not do enough to make our stay more welcome.the management were top class .I will always stay there in future when I have to go to dublin",5,2015,03,29
219,Great Hotel with fantastic location,"Staff very friendly & helpful. Room was comfortable with a table and chairs. Breakfast is amazing with so uch choice - even a pancake maker - wow!
Restaurant/bar great for meals any time of the day.
Location is excellent for those wanting to explore the city or may want to visit surrounding areas as very close to Connolly Station.
Can't wait to return",5,2015,03,29
219,Best Location Ever,"I stay here every year and plan my tourist visits from here, all local transport is at the door of the hotel.  The staff are excellent very welcoming and informative. There is also disabled access through the carpark.  The rooms are very comfortable with everything you need and are centrally heated, room service is always available. The buffet breakfast is wonderful so tasty and so much variety!  McGettigans restaurant is great for a leisurely lunch or lingering dinner again with lots of lovely food. My favourite stay in Dublin.",4,2015,03,26
219,Lovely hotel & staff,"The hotel is lovely, beautifully decorated and high level of cleanliness. Location is perfect walking distance to visit main sights in Dublin, about 15 mins walk from Temple Bar area. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,03,24
219,"Lovely Dublin hotel
With very friendly staff would stay here again",We booked a two night stay for myself and my husband and our daughter and her boyfriend via amoma on a bed and breakfast deal and arrived early morning approx 9am to the hotel we recieved a lovely welcome and were able to have early check in for one room so we could put our bags Safe we were given room 101 which was explained beforehand could be noisy because of the nearby station however we didn't find if to be a problem and the room was very cosy with very modern decor and a lovely new shower facility we done some sightseeing that day and had a verY good nights sleep as the bed was very comfy The following morning we went to breakfast were met by a very friendly hotel concierge who seated is at our table and explained there was a plumbing problem on the floor of our hotel and we would need to relocate to another room but we would be given a nice room for the inconvenience however this was not the case we were relocated to 363 which wasn't as nice as the previous room it wasn't as plush and didn't have the nice shower room but we were given late check out even taking into account the room move I would use this hotel again it's a short walk to temple bar berlin castle And  st Patricks cathedral and the welcome and breakfast were second to none definately going to make another visit to Dublin sometime soon,4,2015,03,24
219,Weekend Birthday Treat,"This trip was a weekend away for my birthday from my Daughter the hotel is very nice the staff are very helpful we got a room that was right across from the train station I rang reception and within 10 mins we were moved to a another room.
The hotel has a restaurant that is very nice lots of different things on the Blackboard every day house specials there is also a beer garden, the breakfast is also good from cooked breakfast to fresh fruit they also have a pancake machine where you make your own and add syrup etc to them.
They have suites on the 7th floor you get your breakfast free with those otherwise it 12.50 Euros 
We enjoyed our stay there are lots to see and do we went to a comedy show on the Sunday night its called The Comedy Crunch its really funny and its free which is a bonus, its about a 15 minute walk from the Hotel ......Enjoy your stay we did  Plus free WIFI throughout the Hotel",4,2015,03,24
219,"Lovely place, great location","Me and my husband stopped for 2 nights booked through ebookers.com and we were extremely happy with the room and service we received. We got in to Dublin very early and the hotel kindly let us in our room 3 hours Before check in! The premier lounge was a big bonus to us and is a great little extra for drinks etc. The location is ideal as we brought a card for 3 days unlimited bus and tram travel but without this its only a short walk to a pub, restaurant or town. All in all this hotel was perfect for us all our questions answered, directions given to us and when a request was made we had room service within 10 minutes. We also ate in the restaurant and bar within the hotel and can highly recommend this as well.  The prices are good and bar staff were amazing and made our night more enjoyable. We will definitely return to this hotel when we next visit.",5,2015,03,23
219,Such an enjoyable stay!,"We got to the hotel around 10pm, and were checked in quickly and easily by the welcoming front desk staff. Our room was spacious, clean, and overall very quiet, with decent sized bathroom, tea/coffee making facilities, iron and hairdryer. O'Connell St is about a 10 minute walk away from the hotel, or you can take the route down to the river in about 15, which is also nice. The breakfast is great value - cooked items, cereals, fruit, pancakes, tea/coffee, etc., so there is no need to go hungry! We also used the gym and sauna, which were great to have at our disposal and as clean and pleasant as the rest of the hotel. When we checked out we were allowed to leave our luggage at the hotel while we explored, and took the shuttle bus (only 5 euros) to the airport, which was prompt and efficient. All in all, this was a marvellous hotel and made our trip immensely enjoyable.",5,2015,03,23
219,"Wonderful trip to Dublin, Ireland","My daughter and I traveled to Dublin, Ireland for a trip which included Dublin and Killarney.  Our experience at the North Star Hotel was excellent.  The staff was wonderful, the food was delicious, and the concierge was able to answer all my questions and guide me.  The location to the Connolly Station tram to get the Heuston Station was ideal.  The shuttle service to and from the airport was timely.  I would come again.",4,2015,03,20
219,Nicely situated.,We stayed at this hotel for the last two nights of our Ireland vacation. The parking was a bit flighty but the hotel was great. The lobby is impressive with its grand staircase and beautiful decor. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. My kids loved the WIFI and the tea service that was in every room. We could walk to O'Connell street in less that five minutes and there were a multitude of shops and eateries along the way.,5,2015,03,20
219,Home away from home,"We arrived on 3/11 at the North Star, and from the minute we walked in the door we felt welcome and relaxed. This is our first trip to Ireland and we needed a lot of guidance. Clair, is fantastic . She takes great care of us, and you can tell from her attention to detail that she takes her job very seriously. She wants her guest to be happy and to have a great time.
John the bartender , went out of his away as well to advise us, and make sure we have everything we need. I really wish I could name every person that works here and thank them personally because they all , every last one, go out of their way to make our stay they best experience. 
We are a party of 6, we started our vacation here with a 3 day stay,  and are now back here after a 6 day tour taking a break before we head to Belfast. 
We think of the North Star as coming home between our trips. 

Thank you every one,
The McCabe/Ingeman group. ",5,2015,03,19
219,Another good hotel & excellent customer service!,"We stay at the hotel a couple of times a year when we organise gigs in Dublin. I am really pleased to say that every visit is more and more pleasant.  Customer service is excellent, especially Maria who works at reception is extremely helpful. I was very surprised when I called the hotel one day before our arrival to confirm something and she recognised me immediately.  My advise is to book premium rooms on the 6th and 7th floor. They are slightly more expense, but have a balcony and access to the premier lounge where you can grab a cup of coffee, juice or a bottle of mineral water for free at any time of the day and night. It's quite useful when you get back to your room after the whole day of working and the last thing you want is to look for a shop to get a drink. Would I recommend the hotel? Of course, we have already book it for October.",5,2015,03,19
219,5 star service for the average tourist,"The North Star hotel had exceptional accommodations, the lobby appeared to be plucked out of a gatsby era & the staff was incredibly welcoming. Diana & Claire went above & beyond answering our questions & arranging our travel needs to & from the train stations. If you have an opportunity to dine in the restaurant, sit at the bar! John was amazing, as well as the other bartender Shawn (?). We dined there our first night (March 15) & were particularly impressed with the fish & chips, the house made tartar was quite tasty & the fish was perfectly seasoned with sea salt! Breakfast was better than expected, my only complaint would be they ran out of English breakfast tea, but the fruit tea (purple label) was a perfect pair of strawberries & mint, very refreshing...which I wouldn't have tried if they did have the tea I wanted, blessing in disguise! The staff working breakfast was quite friendly as well! Our room was the perfect size for the three of us! Beds were quite comfy, however our neighboring guests were quite loud...but who can control that! All in all, it was a fantastic place & I'm looking forward to my return!",5,2015,03,17
219,Lovely little vintage stay with a upbeat attitude.,Everyone from the staff was extremely friendly! The vintage decor was very fitting. The concierge helped me and my friends get accompanied to the area by suggesting local pubs to dine in and traveling adjustments. Our bartender John was exceptionally friendly and very attentive. I order the fish and chips. T'was delicious! The house keeper personally delivered fresh towels to our room. The front desk host Diane arranged a taxi for our pick up. Absolutely every staff member was fantastic! What a great place to stay so close to the city of Dublin.,5,2015,03,17
219,"Handy to O,Connell Street",nice place. Good staff. A couple of hundred yards from main bus station and opposite Connolly Train Station. Very relaxing. Rooms ideal but a bit warm. However there is a fan in room on arrival. Lovely burger in the main bar. Friendly bar staff. You won't be disappointed,4,2015,03,17
219,Decor and amenities all outdated - not like the renovated pictures,"I paid just under ¬£300 on Lastminute.com to stay in a room for three nights that had a TV in it from the 90s, and a bathroom with a bath/shower combo where they had matts for non-slipping. It was worse than an apartment I rented in my 20's. Very outdated - clearly there was no renovations done in the room I was given. I would never go back or recommend it. Waste of money. I am not sure how many rooms look like the pictures, but mine definitely did not. There was also a smell in the hall ways that reminded me of a retirement village. Service was average. Everyone was of course nice, but nothing that I would consider above average.",1,2015,03,16
219,Great hotel! Highly recommended,"Just back from a 2 night stay. Great location, great staff and fully worth at least 4 stars. As a visitor from the north I drove to dublin. The hotel was easily found and the parking was secure and cheap. I highly recommend this hotel and any future trips to dublin will be spent in this fantastic hotel.",5,2015,03,15
219,Beautiful hotel! Would stay again,"My boyfriend and I had a weekend in Dublin booked for us by his parents for our Christmas present. First time in the city, we got the airlink bus from the airport which dropped us off around the corner from the hotel for just ‚Ç¨6 each or ‚Ç¨10 return. 

We arrived a little early for check in but we were asked if we wanted to store our bags behind reception until we could check in which we did. We left the hotel to get our bearings and bought some essentials before returning and checking in. Check in was very quick and we proceeded to our room on the 7th floor. It was a lovely room,  king size bed with a safe, fridge, hairdryer, tv and kettle with tea, coffee etc. everything we needed. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the bus station side, you do hear the trains coming in but it's barely noticeable. 

We had our evening meal in McGettigans Cookhouse & Bar located just off reception on the ground floor. It was a lovely meal! Staff were very friendly and attentive. We were served by Keith who advised us on the menu (as the food was on a ‚Ç¨19.99 offer and the two courses did not add up to that cost so he put them through separately) as well as chatting to us about where we were from etc. Could not fault the service or food. We ate there the next day too. If you are served by Paddy or John at the bar you are in good hands they are absolutely lovely!

We were also booked in for the breakfast which was buffet style with your usual cereals, fruits, juices, pastries, tea, coffee, toast and hot food with the added bonus of cold meats, speciality teas and cheeses as well as a pancake making machine (which was taken advantage of by us of course). Lovely staff here again with Thomas welcoming us to our table and great food to fill you up to start your day. 

The hotel itself is located in a good place, we walked everywhere we went even to the Guinness storehouse which was a walk and a half but it was good to see the city. You are close to busses, trains and the trams so you aren't short of ways to get around. 

Overall the hotel was exactly what we wanted and more than we expected. Could not fault it and we would definitely go back here again. Thanks for a wonderful weekend! ",5,2015,03,11
219,Perfect,"Just home from a two night stay. The staff couldn't be more helpful, we got a free upgrade on arrival which was lovely, our window wouldn't open so they kindly moved us to another room with no hassle at all. Room had a balcony and sliding doors which was fabulous.
Very central to all tourist attractions and within walking distance to o'connell street.
The icing on the cake was the restaurant which had a superb course of different food and drink.
5 star all round!
Thankyou North Star :-)",5,2015,03,09
219,2 night break,"stayed here as we were attending the High Flying Birds gig in 3 Arena
good value for money and pretty central 5min walk from O'Connell Street, plenty of bars and shops round about the hotel and straight across from Connelly Rail/Tram Station.
the hotel is fine for a couple of nights stay, the rooms could do with an upgrade as could the shower as it went between cold, ok, roasting, ok, boiling throughout but nonetheless it was fine and i would recommend if you were only looking for somewhere to put the head down",4,2015,03,09
219,Great hotel,"Booked this hotel for my hubby's 40th birthday and really loved it,!!! Hotel rooms are really nice, breakfast was fab too. We also eat at the cookhouse and that was gorgeous. The lobby and bar area are also really lovely too. Location was great only 10 min walk into temple bar. Great hotel and dublins  a great place..",5,2015,03,09
219,Overnight stop.,The best thing about this hotel is the staff.  They are so helpful.  Was quite happy with the accommodation but felt the room to be a little on the small side.  I booked a family room for myself and my 2 daughters both in their early twenties.  The room was big enough for two adults but it felt a little overcrowded with 3 of us. The bathroom was also on the tiny side.  Then I am a big woman so room size means a lot to me. But it is so convenient that I would overlook that.  Clean and well presented. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will definitely go back again.  I meant to tell them though about their air freshener.  I am allergic to certain kinds of perfume and also air fresheners.  As soon as I walked in the odour just went for me...I always have to ask whoever I am with what do they smell as it comes across as blocked sewage to me - just certain kinds...so I hope they will change it before I return. My daughters assured me that it was just air freshener.  If that had not happened I would be rating the hotel as very good.,3,2015,03,08
219,Lovely hotel. Excellent customer service,My husband booked this hotel for a celebratory night away. We had heard that it was lovely. It didn't disappoint. Staff very courteous. Hotel lovely. Restaurant was very busy. Atmosphere buzzing. We had upgraded to a premier suite and it was simply gorgeous. Bathroom really luxurious and bed super comfortable. Great nights sleep. Very little outside noise. Great that you can park at the hotel for as little as ¬£8 overnight to 12pm next day. Within 10 mins easy walking distance to city centre. Would definitely recommend and stay there again.,5,2015,03,08
219,"Nice hotel, very accomodating staff","We were happy with our stay.  From check in to the porters to the restaurant, we have no complaints.  The rooms are clean.  The staff go out of their way to accomodate requests.  It was very nice relaxing in the evening with a cup of tea in the lobby - it is just a place that makes you feel comfortable.  The hotel is very close to shopping, tours, the train - you do not need to find transportation as you can walk from the hotel.  We would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,07
219,Excellent customer service!,"My boyfriend booked this hotel for my birthday weekend away to Dublin. We arrived the hotel and booked in and everything was fine, the staff were smiley and friendly.
Our room was clean and spacious and was lovely, just perfect for the weekend! Especially for the price, very good value for money.
However, on the Saturday evening we were getting ready for our night out, a meal and drinks and I was about to get into the shower and realised there was no hot water at all!!
This obviously was not ideal and we were both very annoyed and called down to reception. They then sent a handyman up to our room to inspect, this then lead to the plumber being called to the hotel as there was an issue with the plumbing.
After being brought up in a hotel in Blackpool, I understand that these things can happen.. however, in order for us to go out we needed to take a cold shower (not what we paid for)
Therefore the next day we were told to speak to the manager, she was the most lovely woman ever, she was small with blonde hair (forgotten her name)
She was very apologetic and then offered us a free meal each and desert. Even served us herself, which I really appreciated. The food was absolutely delicious. The manager also paid for our taxi back to the airport which was worth around 25 euros. 
Overall the stay was excellent, because of the staff and I would recommend as the shower was fixed by the next morning too!",5,2015,03,07
219,Delightful find.,"What a delightful hotel, wonderfully clean and well presented. We upgraded to premiere before we arrived so were able to check in early and use the executive suite for coffee and bottles of water on the top floor. On our first day we had a problem with the tv, the staff quickly moved us to another room at no extra expense, throughout our stay all of the staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative I can find is that the bathroom felt tired but this was only looking with a very critical eye at grout and sealant. One tip I have is that if you want food late, don't order room service, there is a huge papa John's next to the spike in town which seems to be open 24hrs. The north star is within walking distance of Dublin centre, pubs and attractions and if you require any advice there is usually a very jollly gentleman sat behind a desk in the foyer offering tourist advice. Overall we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2015,03,07
219,Don't let the area put you off ,"The Hotel itself is nice & Central, near Connolly St, & a short walk to Henry St. Fabulous decor inside & lovely food. Daily menus & food prep my top chefs.     Staff very friendly & efficient. Highly recommended.                            Worth a visit for lunch, dinner or stay. ",4,2015,03,07
219,Fantastic hotel in fantastic location,"Short break as attending concert at the Arena. 2 min walk from the 747 link airport bus. Opposite Connelly station that links you around the city. Great breakfast, luxury rooms, friendly staff, good facilities & short walk from town. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,03,07
219,Very relaxing!!,We stayed at the North Star at the beginning of our rail trip of Ireland and again at the end.  It was a wonderful place to plan our upcoming excursions and decompress after the trip. It was very close to city center to finish any last minute shopping. Highly recommended.,5,2015,03,06
219,"Very nice hotel, convenient to city centre.","Very nice hotel, convenient to city centre. Main interior was quite sleek and modern. The bedroom, though clean was a little bit dated in look and feel. Bathroom was modern and spacious with full-sized bath. Considering the proximity of the Dart line and the main road outside, the hotel was surprisingly quiet.",4,2015,03,04
219,Nice reception - tired bathroom ,"My wife and I travelled to the North star in mid February for two nights. We booked with Alpharooms and got a good deal. We got into Dublin about 9am and found our requested room ready for early check in which was great. We were greeted by pleasant and helpful reception staff. 
The Bedroom was ok but not spotless with a decent mattress with an old fashioned square small tv. 
The bathroom looked tired and had a DIY finish and really needs updating  - Cracked tiles - poor silicon etc and poor lighting. The shower controls was just a threaded bar. 
After my first shower the bathtub was streaked with dark dust/grit? as if it hadn't been cleaned for a while. 
Breakfast was great with everything you could want including pancakes. 10/10.

It's a steady 15min walk across to the Temple bar area.

We used the hotels shuttle bus (paddy-wagon) to get to and from the airport (‚Ç¨5each) which is good value. 
Would I stay again?........yes but the rooms need updating first. ",3,2015,03,03
219,Adequate and average. Stupid parking fees!,"I stayed here with my husband while he was on business. The staff were friendly enough and our Executive Room was a good size. The executive lounge was in a terrible mess on my first day - breakfast things were never cleared and there was no milk. On other days the breakfast was ok, with a selection of cold meats, cheese and cereals. After that there was only biscuits. I thought it was a poor executive lounge compared to others. The bathrooms had several of my pet hates : inadequate lighting for doing ones make up, squeezy soap/shampoo in the correct position for a shower, but hopeless for a bath unless you enjoy hopping up and down and no conditioner (when will hotels ever learn that women with long hair do not find ""conditioning shampoo"" satisfactory). The hotel is handy for the business district and station area. I don't mind paying a parking fee of ‚Ç¨8 a day, but on the day I took the car out (I left 2 days before my husband) they wanted to charge me ‚Ç¨12 for the day as I had parked for 6 hours after midday, at which point it becomes ‚Ç¨2 per hour. Does anyone follow the logic of charging you more for taking it out than leaving it in until the next morning, even when you have a room?! Ridiculous.",3,2015,02,28
219,One of the best hotels in Dublin !,"We always stay at the North Star when traveling to Dublin. The rooms are modern and tastefully decorated and great value for money, the hotel's location is excellent but most importantly the staff are so friendly and accommodating. From the reception staff to the car park attendants you can tell that they all enjoy their work and will do anything to help you enjoy your stay. Mc Gettigans Cookhouse and Bar is also great value and serve the most delicious food i've had in any hotel.",5,2015,02,27
219,Gem of a hotel and star staff,"Our first night room was small and when we mentioned it ,the on Duty Manager sorted it in 20 mins. with a delightful touch.FOOD is excellent and beautifully presented, wont get better Hotel Grub in DUBLIN.The staff  in Mc Gettigans Cookhouse are a delight to deal with .....Refreshing to see in Hotels these days. Right outside Dublin is waiting to be discovered .",5,2015,02,25
219,What a lovely hotel,"I recently stayed for 3 nights.  Superb value for money, lovely room, great staff, nothing was too much trouble.  The Buffet breakfast was great value and set us up for our days sightseeing.  The sauna was lovely to relax in at the end of a day's walking.  The bar and restaurant were very inviting and a lovely environment for both hotel residents and locals.  Monday night was build your own burger night, fabulous ",5,2015,02,22
219,Great little find,"Made to feel very welcome from the second we walked in the door. Cosy rooms, good breakfast and close to bars and restaurants. Main streets only a 10 minute walk away, fantastic!! 
We will definitely be back!!",4,2015,02,21
219,great hotel close to car ferry and railway station,"Chose this hotel because we were sailing out of Dublin at 8am and wanted to be close to the ferry - literally took 5 mins driving from hotel to the port.  They have a carpark beside the hotel with valet parking. It cost 10 euro for the night.  We stayed in the hotel for supper which was absolutely fine.  The restaurant do specials every night plus a normal bar food type menu and we were pleased with what we had.  The barman was great - really attentive and witty - nothing too much trouble - he went off to reception to get us a map and pointed things out for us but we decided to just have a stroll around rather than get into a taxi to go further afield.  There is nothing much around the hotel so I wouldn't do that again!  If you want to go somewhere like Temple Bar there is a taxi rank directly opposite the hotel by the railway station and i think it takes about 10 minutes to get to the main restaurant/pub area.  You don't hear trains from the hotel.
Our bedroom was perfectly adequate for our one night stay - very clean with really comfy beds and tea making facilities.
The hotel has been recently refurbished and it looks great and is very comfortable.  Corridors still smelling of fresh paint but that is but a very minor irritation.  Overall, very handy location and i would definitely use the hotel again.",5,2015,02,20
219,Great base for a city break,"Short (2 night) stop in Dublin as part if a longer trip in Ireland. Got a family ""triple room"" which is three single beds (not what we expected but fine). Friendly staff. Valet car parking. Ten walking minutes to a number of central locations. A little bit hard to find from the driving directions - it's further up Amiens St than you expect. ",4,2015,02,20
219,A Very Comfortable Centrally Located Hotel,"My mum and I decided to brighten up a dull January with a couple of days shopping in Dublin and selected the 'Winter Warmer' deal at the North Star Hotel.  This hot chocolate on arrival and a three course meal during the course of our stay.

As far as location goes, if your coming in via Connolly Station, you won't get handier.  If you walk out the main doors of the station, go down the stairs/escalator, walk over to the main road, look down to your right and you'll see the hotel sign just across the road.  To walk to the city centre, take a right at the hotel door, walk past the 'Spar' next door and take a sharp right down that road.  It's the very first junction, a few metres from the hotel.  The bottom of that (admittedly quite long) shopping street is the huge 'needle' on O'Connell Street.  As a point of reference, it is a brilliant means of making sure you're never lost!

I had asked for a quiet room and that's exactly what we got.  We had a room on the top floor at the back and I can honestly say, we barely heard a train.  It was one of the 'premier' rooms and while no larger than an average hotel room, it was beautifully appointed,  It had robes, slipper, tea/coffee making equipment and a small fridge.  There was also a club lounge available, though we didn't use it.

The majority of the staff we came across were very friendly and helpful.  One small issue was the night we had our meal in the restaurant.  We 'waited to be seated' as the sign said, and waited .... and waited.  The restaurant was less than a third full and a couple of waitresses and a waiter passed us several times.  In the end we got bored and seated ourselves.  It then took another 10 minutes for anyone to come over to us.  However, the waitress who eventually did serve us was lovely, chatty and helpful.

One odd thing was that when we arrived back, quite late from the theatre on our first night, and opened our bedroom door, waves of heat hit us immediately.  There was almost a haze of heat in the room.  I hadn't looked for or noticed a thermostat when we'd left our bags in earlier so had to find it.  When I did, we discovered it was sitting at 37 degrees!  Now, I'm sure the hotel are not in the business of wasting heat like that so it must have been the previous occupants but it's odd that the heating would not be set to knock itself off when it reaches a certain point.  As it was, my mum and I spent an uncomfortable night without even a sheet over us until about 5 am when the temperature dipped.

The food in the hotel is lovely. The restaurant/bar has a nice ambience and, even if you're not eating, it's a nice place for a relaxing drink.  Breakfast is in the basement but the room has been decorated well with plenty of mirrors so you don't get a 'cellar' feeling!  The breakfast definitely sets you up for the day, ensuring you need nothing more than a snack at best, to keep you going until dinner time.  If you're from the north of Ireland it's worth noting that what we call 'wheaten bread', southerners call 'soda bread'.  Which is strange really when it's made from wheat flour rather than soda flour. Anyway, if, like my mum you ask for soda bread, be aware that you not be getting what you think!  Also, if you have children with you, look out for their little pancake machine - they'd love it!

I would definitely recommend this hotel as it is good value for money in Dublin terms, is clean, comfortable and, from my experience, very, very warm!",4,2015,02,20
219,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel recently refurbished, Got a free upgrade the second night I stayed here, There is a handy area for drinks and bar times were very good, Very clean and well up to date, Only problem was the receptionist could not find my booking, But got it sorted",5,2015,02,18
219,Good Night's Sleep,"I stay in Dublin semi regularly for business and tried this hotel for the first time this week. I chose it because it's very handy for Dublin Connolley railway station. If you're travelling to or from Dublin by rail, there's no handier place.

Check in was friendly and efficient and my room was comfortable with a small balcony to enjoy the nice views of the city. The bathroom was nicely decorated and well fitted, however, there were lots of hairs in and around the bath, which was disappointing.

The hotel restaurant was comfortable, welcoming and well staffed. The food was reasonably priced too. They had a two courses for 20 Euros offer, which was good value and, unlike some other hotels, a pint of lemonade was only 80 Cents! (I paid ¬£5 for a large lemonade in  a hotel a couple of weeks ago!)

After a nice meal, I had a really good night's sleep in the very comfortable bed in my room.

Breakfast was nice and there was plenty of variety.

If you're travelling to Dublin for business or pleasure, I'd recommend this hotel.",4,2015,02,18
219,Clean City Centre Location,"I've stayed here before, although on this trip I didn't get the same great deal as before. But despite this, it is still a really good place to stay. It's within walking distance to the train station, and main bus station. The shopping area is also only a few minutes walk away. The classier shops on Grafton St., and St. Stephen's Green, are about a 15 minute walk away. 
Rooms/bathrooms are very clean, and the staff very bubbly, and friendly. Can be a tad noisy (street/train), as with most hotels located in the city centre. But nothing that would put me off. I look forward to staying again.",4,2015,02,17
219,Brilliant!!!!!!!,"My brother in law organised this for 4 couples...approx ¬£64 per person. 1st class return translink, one night in North Star bed and breakfast. 
Can honestly say was a brilliant experience.
The 2 hour journey down in the train was fantastic, very relaxing....girls loved it!! Arrive in O'Connell station at 10 o'clock walked to North Star (3 mins!). Left our bags at reception and went to the Guinness factory for a tour.
On our return to the hotel at 2.30 the men went to the back bar which is in an arch below the railway track. The staff were brilliant...very attentive. Large flat screen TV to watch the Ireland match.
We had pre booked dinner for 7 o'clock. The menu was very good and again staff very attentive and could not been more helpful. Food was brilliant..would recommend the burger!
Most were in bed for 10.00. 
Next morning up for breakfast. This was fantastic! On offer, full Irish breakfast, continental breakfast, scones, pancakes, cereal, fruit, different juices, coffee, tea etc....self service eat as much as you want!!
Overall a fantastic hotel...credit to the owner, manager and staff, will def be back.
See you soon",5,2015,02,17
219,Miss Lisa Martin,"PERFECT!!!!! Just got back to England after a girls weekend away in Dublin, and what a beautiful, beautiful hotel this is!! I read the reviews so thought I'd give my point, just to show the truth! 
   The hotel really is amazing! It's spotless, smells gorgeous as soon as you walk through the door, fresh flowers on reception and the staff are just so welcoming! Our rooms were immaculate and had everything we needed. Toiletries, tea, coffee, wifi etc.
   I noticed a few complaining about silly things in these reviews, such as the train noise, etc, well our room was very close to the station and we didn't hear a thing, as the trains don't run all through the night!! Petty!!!
   The food in the restaurant was gorgeous, as were the cocktails! Also, I'd like to mention the bartender who served us (completely forgotten his name, but he has shaved, sandy hair, and played the whistle for us!!) what a lovely man, and please thank him for the cupcakes!
    I can't praise this hotel enough, it's absolutely perfect, in every way, and I didn't want to leave.
    Thank you to all who made our first trip to Ireland such a memorable one. When we visit again, there's no doubt about it, we will be coming to this hotel, absolutely!!! 
Thank you. üòòÔ∏èxx",5,2015,02,16
219,Quick break,"Spent one night here with my mum, son and sister.  We arrived around 10.00 am and we just wanted to drop our bags.  We were given our room straight away which was great.  This is a lovely hotel, staff friendly and helpful.  The Irish breakfast is amazing!   I would definitely return!  Xxx",4,2015,02,16
219,Very clean and friendly,"My boyfriend and I stayed last week for two nights. We paid ¬£120 for two nights, including breakfast (booked via Alpharooms). 

We arrived at the hotel at 8:30am expecting to just leave our bags, but we were allocated a room immediately. This was just what we needed after our journey. 

The room wasn't exactly modern, but it was well equipped, comfortable and clean. The breakfast was lovely, with a large selection of food. I noticed fresh fried eggs being served at 9:50, 10 minutes before breakfast finishing, which was very good as hotels are usually clearing the food away at this point. 

The staff all seemed friendly and helpful. We used the airport shuttle bus for both airport journeys, and this was very good. The hotel bar/restaurant looked very good but we didn't get chance to use it. 

The location of the hotel was fine for us as we walked everywhere we went. We were very glad that we chose to book this hotel, especially for the price we paid. ",4,2015,02,15
219,Not What I Had Hoped,"My boyfriend and I stayed there in December and we had high hopes. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver. I felt the hotel was slightly run down. Our room was stark and the bathroom was actually kind of grubby. Worse still, the smell of natural gas permeated the lobby. When we went to breakfast one day there was a bad sewage smell. On the up side, the breakfast was nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. I wouldn't stay there again though and for what I paid, I could have stayed in a nicer hotel that was more convenient to Temple Bar and Grafton Street.",3,2015,02,14
219,Centrally Located,"The North Star is centrally located in Dublin across from Connelly Train Station. It's just a couple of blocks from O'Connell Street.  I booked this hotel through the Air Canada site. As a solo woman traveler, I wanted a safe, clean spot. Haven flown in from Toronto, I was delighted to be able to check into my room at 10:30 in the morning. There is a restaurant/pub attached to the hotel. Great coffee shop just around the corner. The staff was warm and welcoming. I needed an extra adapter and they quickly supplied one.",4,2015,02,12
219,Great weekend!,"We spent two nights at the hotel. We were greeted warmly at the front desk informed us that we were allocated a room on the 7th floor with access to the premier club lounge (we had paid for a regular room). The rooms are nice and clean, another plus for the balcony. Premier lounge very nice, you can enjoy a cup of coffee and sit in the evenings. Take advantage of the sauna. Although the room is missing slippers and bathrobes. Close to downtown, great service. I really recommend it!",5,2015,02,09
219,Hidden gem,"Great hotel keep going back . Staff are very helpful and pleasant and very quick check in . The rooms are always  clean and beds are so comfortable tv ,iron ,hairdryer , tea and coffee facilties . Breakfast are lovely to much food to choose from.  The bar food was to a high standard also. there is also all night room service which is a good price  lovely and very quick service . Short walk to O 'Connell st  . Just across the road there is the train station ,luas [ which is there tram service] ,bus station and a taxi rank  . Cant wait to go back",5,2015,02,09
219,Great Stay For Dublin Break.,Myself and wife stayed at the North Star Hotel for three nights whilst visiting Dublin for our tenth wedding anniversary as well as a get together over the weekend with friends. The hotel is right opposite Connelly Train Station and from the outside just looks like a pub but as soon as you walk through the front door you realise what an lovely place you have entered. Our room wasn't ready but the reception staff looked after our luggage whilst we went for a quick wander around to get our bearings. Once back at the hotel we were quickly checked in and on our way to our top floor room with tonnes of floor space and a massive extremely comfortable super king size bed as well as a bathroom with rainforest shower and bath. The bar staff were really friendly and the banter between us or (the Craic) as the Irish call it was soon in full flow and added to the pleasurable experience. Without a doubt the next time we visit Dublin this is where we will stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone.,5,2015,02,09
219,The North Star Hotel,"We stayed here last night. Hotel is beautifully decorated, the staff were very helpful and kind, the bed was ridiculously comfortable and the room was gorgeous. I think we found our new favourite hotel in Dublin. We'll definitely be back.",5,2015,02,08
219,Brilliant Stay,"Stayed here for one night on 5th February. I have stayed here before and chose this hotel again because of what I've read here on TripAdvisor. We were welcomed warmly on arrival and allowed to check in early, which was great after the long drive from Lisburn. The reception area was lovely and clean with beautiful decor, not at all what you would expect from the outside! (Not that outside was any different, very clean and well maintained!) We were given room 760 on the top floor, I had requested a room with a balcony on the top floor and got exactly what I asked for; excellent customer service (thanks to Jackie in reservations). Our room was very spacious and well decorated with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! We had a great view over Croke Park, just had to be careful that we had the nets pulled at all times otherwise the residents of the apartments opposite may have seen more than they wanted! The bathroom was nicely laid out with a great waterfall shower. 
We ate in the restaurant that evening and again, I had some of the best food I have ever tasted! Very reasonable prices too. 
The only gripe I have was trying to collect our car after checkout. The valet was nowhere to be seen, even after my partner went back in to reception to see where he was after ten minutes of waiting. After a total of almost twenty minutes, he finally arrived laughing as if everything was OK and said he'd only been gone a few minutes; he ignored me when I said that he could not have been seeing I had been there waiting for almost twenty! 
All in all though, still a fantastic 5* stay, we are currently booking time of work in August to come back down with some friends we have (and will definitely continue to) recommended this fantastic hotel to! ",5,2015,02,07
219,Comfortable spot near lots,"15 minute walk to temple bar ... So much activity around. Comfy rooms - great beds and nice pillows. Very nice restaurant in lobby 
All night room service - good price and good food. 
I would stay here again.",4,2015,02,03
219,great location,"fab standard room, cleaned daily with very friendly cleaners, it is just outside the main area of dublin but the tram is just outside your door! people of dublin are very friendly, would definatly stay here again. we didnt have a chance to eat in the hotel but looked like a popular place to meet and eat. thanks ",4,2015,02,01
219,great location for tourists,"first to mention the hotel location is very good,
right next to the connolly train station and the
Luas stop, so good transportation links including 
the 474 airport bus. the hospitality was average, 
the hotel seems to me quite strange from the inside, 
You have to go up some stairs before the access to the lifts. 
my room was nice, large and spacious but some things 
needed to be replaced,for example the mattress was worn, 
the A/C made loud noise, not handle shower,
and the niagara was tired. still to mention that I took
the classic room and not the premier. 
the breakfast was good at a reasonable price.
the staff was nice and welcoming, wi-fi was free of charge.
all in all my stay was O.K. 
for a tourist I think this hotel is fine.",3,2015,01,31
219,Amazing stay!,"Recently stayed here on a suprise trip for my birthday all booked by my boyfriend and wow did he book well! Hotel was really clean and situated in the middle of dublin, where it was easy to walk to local pubs, restaurants and croke park! 
Had a nightmare when we arrived as I thought I'd lost my passport! A lady on reception (who was the food manager) put me at ease and was very kind in calming me down and helping me, ringing the airport etc! 
Also got engaged on this trip so will this hotel will always be a special one for us! X",5,2015,01,28
219,A fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is very central to all that is happening in Dublin.  Close the the station, the tour buses and the shopping areas the hotel is ideal.  We had booked a twin room but were given a suite which was lovely with a large wet room for a bathroom.  The staff here, like most of Ireland, were just so friendly and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble for them. The breakfast was full of everything you could wish for and more though I did find it not as hot as I would like. Another disappointment was when we had a meal in the restaurant on the Saturday evening.  The restaurant was also a bar and there were some very noisy folk in the bar who seemed to have had  a bit to drink!!  Our meal was really very good but the ambience was slightly spoilt by all the noise.  However, overall, we would return to this hotel on out next visit to Dublin.",5,2015,01,28
219,Lovley hotel,"Hotel is beautiful inside , room was basic but had everything we needed. 
location was great , 5 min walk to o;'connell street , 15 min walk to temple bar. 
plenty of places to eat nearby and straight across the road from the train station.
would definetly return !",5,2015,01,25
219,Great Hospitality In Dublin,"The North Star Hotel is lovely. Accommodations are chic and well decorated with nice views of the city. The staff is very accommodating and friendly! The housekeeping managers, Vera and Angela, went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was exceptionally delightful. The hospitality and warm welcome that we received, specifically from Vera, was second to none. We are looking forward to our next stay at the North Star hotel!",5,2015,01,24
219,"Fantastic, thanks","Had a fantastic stay here, I took my husband for his 50th, room was so comfortable, breakfast was great, with plenty of choice, staff were all lovely, very helpful. If we were to return to Dublin, I would defo return to this hotel. Many thanks, Tony and Michelle",4,2015,01,23
219,Excellent,We stayed at North Star hotel on the 15/01/2015 and found this hotel to be very clean .The room we stayed in was very comfortable.we found the staff to be very helpfully and friendly.On the night we arrived our flight was late so when we got to the hotel the restaurant was closing .We had not eating all day so we explained this to the staff and they were wonderful and keep the restaurant opened for us .The next day we had a lovely breakfast well worth the money and it set us up for the day.,5,2015,01,23
219,Very nice. ,"First of all I have to thank them for letting us check in 6 hours early and upgrading us to the premier room. The hotel was nice, all staff were friendly. Location a little out the way so we got taxis back at midnight for ‚Ç¨10. The gym equipment was a little dated but all in good working order. Didn't try the restaurant but it smelled delicious. Overall I would recommend this. Our stay cost ¬£200 for 3 nights. Can't say the difference between standard room and the upgrade. ",4,2015,01,21
219,Excellent ,"I used this hotel as it is close to my place of work in Dublin. 

Staff are pleasant and very well mannered, rooms have a nice modern layout to match the rest of the hotel. 

Nice selection of hand lotions left in the room on a daily basis. 

My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is due to the gym. Now I wasnt expecting it to be perfect but when you step into the gym it almost feels like you have walked into an old hospital from 20 years ago, it could definitely use some renovation. ",4,2015,01,21
219,Fantastic value,Booked into the for the all you can eat breakfast. Fantastic choice from the cereals to the hot food all the way to the cheese and meats. Couldn't fault it and didn't need to eat again till early evening. Would highly recommend it and will definately be booking again on any future trips to Dublin  ,5,2015,01,21
219,The most amazing breakfast,"Recently went on a day trip to Dublin, and thanks to tripadvisor we found the north star hotel. The aircoach dropped us off on O'Connell street, 10 minutes later we arrived at the hotel for breakfast.  We had emailed the booking and paid at the reception desk then went down for breakfast. 
We were spoilt for choice, fruits, cereals, continental and full Irish. The hotel was spotless, clean and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. 

Value wise, 12.50 Euro - well a cup of coffee in a coffee shop is 5 euro, need i say any more!!",5,2015,01,21
219,Super weekend,"Stayed at this hotel which is only 10 mins walk from centre of Dublin. Rooms clean and very comfortable, staff very helpful, dining very very good. Car parking was an added bonus. On morning of departure we were leaving well before breakfast was served and we were supplied with a bag containing sandwiches, apple, water and a yoghurt together with a spoon and serviette. Really helpful and considerate. Would use this hotel again.",4,2015,01,20
219,Great hotel in an ideal location,"Fab hotel for a very competitive price if booked in advance. Lovely staff, food is delicious & reasonable. I adore the decor and funky colourful furniture! You have everything you need in the rooms and bar area/restaurant is also very comfortable. Superb location and a very pleasant visitor experience overall.",5,2015,01,18
219,Great little hotel,"Stayed here as part of a tour, but it was a true find!  Very convenient to train and bus stations, and a short walk to the main drag.  We walked to the Abbey Theater, to restaurants, and to catch the on and off bus.  Their restaurant was also delicious and very quiet, after a busy day.  The staff was amazing!!!  They remembered us every time we came in and helped us find all kinds of things.  It was a true find.",5,2015,01,15
219,"Amazing hotel, perfect location, bargain price","The North Star hotel is a wonderful place, very friendly and helpful staff and received a free upgrade on arrival, beautiful room with balcony, massive king sized bed. Lovely bathroom and shower, clean, fresh towels and toiletries/condiments replenished daily. 

We stayed for 2 nights (09.01.15 - 11.01.15) and had an amazing weekend. The hotel is ideally located for the city centre, O'Connell's Street and then over to Temple Street and surrounding areas. Took me and my partner 10-15 minutes to walk to the Temple Bar area at a relaxed pace and only half an hour to the Guinness Factory tour, which is an absolute must. Also had one of the best nights in The Oliver St.John Gogarty bar and lovely meal at Gallaghers Boxty House, both on Temple Street.

One of the best weekends we've ever had, culture and Irish music/dancing is unreal! Dublin is an incredible place and the North Star hotel is a credit to the city - we will definitely be back in the very near future.",5,2015,01,12
219,Very nice,"We just got back from a weekend in Dublin. We bought our Room at the North Star hotel through the mystery hotel deal. We paid in total ¬£265 for our return flights and Friday and Saturday night in the hotel which was an absolute bargain!!
The hotel was lovely even though we were in one of their most basic rooms. Breakfast was around ‚Ç¨12 euros for a cooked Buffett and was very tasty. There was a full gym and sauna available and although it looked as though it was out of town a little, it was around a 5-10 minute walk to o'connell street and we didn't end up getting busses or taxis all weekend (apart from to and from the airport) you can literally walk to nearly everything you might want, even the zoo only took around 40 mins to get to and was incredible!! 
On our first night we did the ghost bus tour which is definitely worth it if you want to hear some of the darker history of Dublin, you get taken to graveyards and get to see the underworld of Christchurch.

 
Beautiful city, beautiful hotel, would highly recommend to all. ",5,2015,01,12
219,Very Average,"Rooms are very small and not soundproof.  You can hear every little noise outside including the nearby train.  Also, we stayed on two separate days and each room the shower head looked to not be connected very well to the wall.",2,2015,01,12
219,Lovely break,"Arrived early on the 5th Jan, checking in around 10am and was pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. Room was lovely and clean. Although we were happy with our room, we decided to upgrade to a Premier room for an extra ‚Ç¨30 per night. Bed was massive and very comfortable, the rainforest shower was also lovely. Breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice while the restaurant downstairs offered a variety of different meals including special offers on different nights. Tried the burger night on the Monday and was very satisfied with the quality and presentation of the food.  Staff were friendly throughout our stay. Great location, 10 minute walk from the main street with plenty of shops and restaurants. Also made use of the transport shuttle bus which tool us to and from the airport. Only ‚Ç¨5 per person each way- definitely cheaper than a taxi! Overall great break and would recommend the North Star Hotel to anyone wishing to visit Dublin for a few days.",5,2015,01,08
219,Simply great.,"Stayed for 5 Days in November. Great location, just across from Connolly Train Station. Very clean and comfortable hotel. Lovely food. Very helpful and friendly staff. Outstanding value for money. Have already booked for my next visit.",5,2015,01,08
219,Most uncomfortable night I've ever had.,"Perhaps the room I stayed in was an isolated case, but the beds were awful.  The double we had sank so badly in the middle that we had little sleep & very sore backs in the morning.
Staff were very curt during check in etc, the phone didn't work in our room, the toilet seat was broken and the bathroom just wasn't quite clean enough.

It seems since the North Star became a 4 star hotel, their standards have slipped.  I was very disappointed as this was a return trip to the hotel, but I think it'll be the last. 
",2,2015,01,06
219,"Mature hotel, friendly staff, and quaint rooms.","Had the opportunity to stay at this hotel, on the tail end of my trip in August of 2014. Before this, we spent the better part of our journey on a Disney Cruise ship in the Mediterranean sea.So, a larger, less ""wavy"" experience was in order.

I typically try and provide a robust and thorough review of my stays and visits, but my experience at this hotel, didn't really inspire strong feelings from me, one way or the other. The hotel staff was friendly and courteous. The lobby and adjoining bar, cozy and warm. The rooms were...quaint...and clean. 

I found the hotel layout to be odd, having to take stairs to a security door and then walked through a common area waiting room with a second service desk (which I hadn't seen staffed); Finally, we made it to our room on the far end of the facility. But I recognize that this is an older building with some real history, so overall, this actually added to the charm. 

Location wise, this would have been a REALLY good place to stay, had the public transit workers not been on strike the two days we stayed. The station is right across the street from the reception desk. Regardless, we actually prefer walking through the foreign cities we visit, so no big deal for us. On this trip, our furthest hike found us trekking several miles to the Guinness brewery. But not many of the other sights we were interested in seeing, are much closer. So...if you like to walk, bring sneakers and an umbrella...cuz you'll be hoofing it quite a bit. 

A couple of experiences of note:

First, there was check out day. On our arrival, we booked travel via their airport bus for our plane for check out morning. We wanted to get it out of the way and simply enjoy our Dublin experience. That morning we headed down stairs, and patiently waited. Unfortunately, the bus was over full, and we were bumped off. The staff IMMEDIATELY coordinated a private taxi for us, at no additional cost. Then, when we realized my son left his iPhone in the room, they had it shipped and waiting for us in New Hampshire, a day after our return; (at a fee of course, which is to be expected). So, this staff is exceptionally accommodating and efficient. 

So, with out a doubt the staff is very good at accommodating guests, and streamlining your stay. 

Experience number 2..the ""Traditional Irish Breakfast"" buffet....Simply put, I was a bit disappointed. We were excited to hear that they offered a traditional ""Irish Breakfast"". Unfortunately, the food was cold, and the dining facility was just flat. A dreary dark basement/underground floor, turned dining center that was next to the gym. They would probably be better off hosting the breakfast in the bar/tavern next door. 

Ok..so here is my high level bullet points:

PRO'S:
1) Efficient and courteous staff. Not friendly per-say....but courteous and polite. Which seemed typical for most of the hotels we visited in Europe. Not like the friendly, jovial hosts we are used to in the US. So....while I like friendly......I appreciate how professional they are. 

2) Location- Close to the public transit. GREAT...when they aren't on staff.

3) Quiet location off the beaten bath. I was just a couple floors above a main street...and it was a QUIET nights sleep.

4)Very clean, homey and dignified. 

5) I know its relative, but we got a 3 bedroom suite, for my wife, and two children, at a reasonable price. 

CONS:

1) Nothing really spectacular about the hotel...which is fine. We may be jaded, because the hotels we acquired in Barcelona, were brilliant and very stylish. 

2) The buffet. Just..no....no....find anywhere else to have breakfast.....

3) Location - Yip...I realize I  listed this as a Pro as well...because this is either a pro or a con. If you like to walk....you might want to find something more central to things....if your gonna hop a bus/trolley...this will do nicely.  

4) The rooms...again...clean...quaint...nothing spectacular. Just a good place to lay your head down at night. So...not a con per-say....just not really a pro. 

Overall, I'd recommend this hotel for most folks. Particularly if you don't plan on spending much time in your room. For me, the staff made the experience much more pleasurable then it might otherwise have been....and thats a good thing.",3,2015,01,05
219,Pre New Year break,"This was our first time to Dublin and we were very impressed with the North Star Hotel.  We arrived early (9.00 am) expecting to just be able to leave our bags until check in time but were told we could have our room as it was ready-we were in fact upgraded to a Premier room which was very spacious, had an extremely comfortable bed and excellent facilities. The room was on the 5th floor and faced the railway line but it was not noisy at all during the night.
The breakfast was plentiful and there was lots of choice.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  We did not go to McGettigans restaurant so I can't comment on that. If we return to Dublin we will definitely stay at the North Star Hotel again as it is very convenient for transport links and the city centre as well as being a first class hotel.",5,2015,01,05
219,Post Christmas weekend in Dublin,"We have just spent two nights in the North Star and as usual we were not disappointed! It is a great hotel in a great location. It is within walking distance from the main Dublin bus station,and although we got to the hotel before 12md our room was ready, which was super because we were tired. Our room on the 5th floor was really nice, very modern and clean. The continental breakfast was more than adequate ,and the hotel restaurant was excellent. I love the fact that you are within walking distance from O'Connell Street and the Luas transport system. I have stayed in The North Star many times and look forward to going back in March! The staff in all areas are really pleasant  and are more than willing to help with any queries that we had. Thank you for a very enjoyable weekend!",5,2015,01,05
219,Such a lovely hotel and in a great location!,"My boyfriend and I went to stay in Dublin from 31 Dec 2014 to 3 Jan 2015.

This really is a lovely hotel. It is located 5 minutes walk from O'Connell Street, which is one of the main high streets, and 15 minutes walk from Temple Bar, which is the main strip. 

If you're coming from Dublin Airport, I recommend getting the Green Paddywagon Bus to the hotel. I think you are meant to book this with the hotel first (‚Ç¨5 each) but we just waited for it to come (the North Star website gives details of what time it is due) and hopped on. It took us about 25 minutes to get to the hotel, which we thought was pretty good. 

We arrived early, so we weren't able to check in straight away, but they were really good about taking your bags and storing them for you until 2pm. There is a man sat at a table to the right of the staircase with all the information about where to go in Dublin and how to get there, which is very useful. 

Once we had been out for the day and came back at about 1.30pm, we were able to check into our room. We were on the first floor right at the end in a 'Suite' room, which was a double and a single bed.We had a lovely sitting area too and a huge wet room. A hairdryer is provided and there is also a television. The bed was extremely comfortable and air-con was available as well. 

The free Wi-fi was a great thing for us and it was really quick to use, which I wasn't expecting and could be used all over the hotel. The room was cleaned every day, and cleaned well. Our free toiletries were topped up every day (even if they had only been moved and not used) and it was always very presentable when we returned. 

My only bad point is the shower. I am used to a very powerful shower at home and I have very long thick hair, so I struggled a little with how weak the shower was. It was a lovely bathroom and the shower was easy to use and the temperature was constant etc., it just wasn't quite strong enough, especially around 6/7pm when everyone was using the water, but apart from that, the room was perfect!

Breakfast was amazing. By far the best breakfast set up I have ever been to. We had the bed and breakfast deal so we didn't have to pay, but they charge ‚Ç¨12.50 for a buffet breakfast, definitely worth it! They have all the typical continental and they also have a large range of cooked options and a pancake machine. Excellent quality and very tasty. 

I had a very enjoyable stay at the North Star Hotel and I would not hesitate to go back! Highly recommend.",5,2015,01,05
219,Pre-Christmas mini break.,"We stayed at the North Star hotel for 3 nights just before Christmas. 
The room was great, very comfortable beds. Spacious, with a nice big flat screen TV and plenty of storage. Other facilities included a kettle, hairdryer, iron and ironing board and mini-fridge. 
The bathroom was very nicely fitted with full length bath and a decent shower, the only slight criticism was a few cracked floor tiles and missing grout. 
We had a fifth floor room opposite the railway line, but the trains were quiet and didn't really bother us. On the plus side, Connolly station was very handy for the Dart railway and there is also a tram stop there, making it easy to travel east-west across Dublin. However, the hotel is only a 10 minute walk from O'Connell Street in the city centre.
The on site restaurant - McGettigans, was really good. Great choice of food and drink, friendly and helpful staff and a lovely ambience. No more expensive than the city centre pubs.
We had breakfast included which gave us a choice from Full Irish breakfast and continental buffet style breakfast with lots of choice. It really set us up for the day!
All staff were really helpful and friendly, there was a really spacious hotel lounge should you choose to use it, as well as a gym and sauna free to residents.",5,2014,12,29
219,Dissapointing,"I had read good reviews about so expected it to be really good but were dissapointed with quite a few things.....

When we arrived the lobby smelt terrible (of sewage) and remained there for the whole of our stay - I have seen a couple of people write about it on here so I think it has been like that for a while! 

I mentioned in the booking that I had booked the 3 night trip as a surprise anniversary present for my boyfriend and they put us in the smallest, dingiest, oldest room. It was not the sort of room we wanted to relax in - especially being there for 3 nights. The TV was old, the bathroom was bright orange and we were on level 1 which looked out onto a small car park and a few buildings. When we mentioned that we wernt happy, they were really good and upgraded us to their exec rooms which were 10 times better - lovely bathroom, bed and very spacious, however we were 100 metres from the railway track (which ran from 5am - 12pm every day) and put right by some meeting rooms which were extreemly noisy at 8am.

I cant fault the staff as they were really helpful, but cant help but think that they chance it by putting people in the non updated rooms first, which were definnalety not a room you would want to relax in for 4 days - and defintely were not up to a 4* standard.

The location was also good as was an easy walk to everywhere, but probably would spend a bit more to go somewhere else if we returned to Dublin.",3,2014,12,28
219,Good cheep hotel,"This hotel is a very centeral hotel with the luas line right across the road. The hotel is a very clean hotel also it has a lovely bar and restruant for dining ,the staff are very helpfull ,the rooms are a good size and clean ,we stayed there for two nights and I would highly recommend this for anyone in taking a Dublin City break",5,2014,12,25
219,Loved it,"Visited Ireland for the first time in November and the North Star Hotel was part of a package. Im glad it was. When I will go back to Dublin I will book there directly.

The staff was very nice and responsive. The rooms were clean and the beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The restaurant had good food and atmosphere.

The best part was the location. It was a short walk to almost everything you want to do in Dublin, yet off the beaten path enough that you dont feel overwhelmed by crowds. I was surprised at how quiet my sleep was being so close to the train tracks. I never heard a thing. 

I would stay there again.",5,2014,12,23
219,Most wonderful staff!,"Yes, the rooms are quite nice and the location is good, close to O'Connell Street and the train station; but most of all, the staff was amazingly accommodating.  They graciously moved our things to another room after we experienced an airconditioning failure.  They relayed messages to and from our tour director, as we extended a few days beyond our trip.  Whatever we asked of them, they were most gracious and helpful.  It was as if we were staying in someone's home.  It was also nice that this was not a large, chain hotel, as North Star had a personality all its own. Be sure to ask the staff about the hotel's connection to James Joyce!",4,2014,12,23
219,Faultless,"Me and my best friend travelled to Dublin on the 19th December and stayed at this hotel. We arrived around 9am in the morning and on arrival to the hotel there was a slight issue with our booking, however the staff were so brilliant at resolving the issue that it did not affect our trip. They offered to hold our luggage until check in at 2 however advised we come back at 12 and our room may be ready. We were so tired so took that offer and as advised our room was ready at 12.
The room was spacious with 2 beds one single and one double, however the single was large. The beds were gorgeous so comfy with lots of space. Then room was tidy and very clean. 
We booked our stay as half board so recieved a dinner voucher for both nights of our stay for the McGettigans cookhouse located at the hotel. To our surprise we were told our vouchers entitled us to a three course meal at the restaurant which was easily worth ‚Ç¨30. The food was gorgeous and again the hospitality was perfect. Buffet breakfast had all you would need with tons of choice and very high quality. 
The location of this hotels is perfect close to shops, transports and nightlife. 
On our last day we had an unpleasant encounter with a homeless man outside the hotel. The staff at the hotel were quick to check if we were okay and one lovely lady went above and beyond and even walked us up the road to ensure we were safe.
The staff are a credit to this hotel. All service we recieved was perfect. Thank you so much to the North Star hotel for a wonderful stay, it would be a pleasure to stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,12,23
219,Amazing birthday weekend,"I took my boyfriend to Dublin for his 25th birthday and we had an amazing time. The room was beautiful with a balcony overlooking Dublin, luxurious king-sized bed and waterfall shower. The hotel staff were friendly and gave us prosecco because we were celebrating. Would definitely return here, made the trip.",5,2014,12,22
219,fantastic hotel,"our first time in Dublin,  this hotel has all you need, lovely rooms, good breakfast, very helpful friendly staff, very good value and by the train/tram station, we went for a short 3 night break and enjoyed every minute, definately recommend this hotel, we never heard the trains as some people seem to have stated but guess that all depends on your room, ours was ace, once again a big THANKYOU to the staff, we WILL be back x",5,2014,12,19
219,Happy Traveller,"We stayed at this hotel on the 6/7 of December2014 as we were going to the Andre Rieu concert  at
The 3Arena.  This hotel really caters for concert goers and provide a shuttle service to and from that venue which is perfect. The room was really comfortable and very clean and cosy. 

The staff were so pleasant and extremely helpful and polite both in the restaurant and at breakfast, both of which we could not fault, you were spoiled for choice.

We have now found our perfect place to stay when we go to our next show in Dublin.",5,2014,12,19
219,Fab Location,"Myself & my husband stayed here a couple of weeks back and i couldn't fault the hotel at all. The staff were lovely & really helpful. The location is fantastic 5 minute walk and your in O Connell street. Really close to the 3 arena as well. We ate in the cook house on both nights as it was so good the 1st night we had to go back again. Parking is handy it is an extra ‚Ç¨8 a day but well worth it as you know your car is safe and being looked after.

Have already booked again for January so looking forward to getting back.",5,2014,12,19
219,Great location,We arrived very early in the morning after an overnight flight. The check in clerk worked to find us a room that was available since we were very tired. Breakfast was great with many things to choose from. Rooms were clean and the sheets smelled great! Only down fall is the hotel is near the train station and you can hear the trains at night. Very close to to O'Connell St. where you can get on the double decker bus. Best money spent because you can hit all the landmarks of the city.,4,2014,12,18
219,A very pleaseant hotel.,"Our first time in Dublin,staff we all very kind and attentive,Paddy the barman made us laugh with his tales,very good breakfast indeed.
Rooms very clean and well presented maybe a little warm,a really good base to see Dublin.
All in all would return again.",4,2014,12,16
219,Does it's very best,"Just back from one night stay in this hotel and found it quite good. 
Pros: Staff, parking, food.
Cons: Rooms while big are basic. The location is somewhat ran down as it is in a north inner city area. The breakfast room has a claustrophobic feel to it as it has no windows.
Overall the staff and value are good and the rooms are clean but the location while central let's it down.",4,2014,12,15
219,Great hotel and location!,"I stayed here on my visit to Dublin with two other girls, for one of their 21st birthdays. 
The hotel was in a great location- 10 minute walk to the shops, 15 minute walk to temple bar- the main place for a night out. The hotel staff were all great and very informative on the best places to go for a night out etc. The hotel was lovely- clean and easy to find. Nice lounge rooms around the hotel that we used for drinks before our nights out! 
Loved our stay here and would be more than happy to come back. Already planning a trip in the new year.",5,2014,12,15
219,Star Hotel,"This was our first time at The North Star Hotel and we would definitely go back again. The service was excellent and we were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived.  The staff were friendly, helpful and nothing was ever too much trouble for them.  Our room was lovely, very spacious and clean, and we were pleased that there were tea/coffee making facilities available.  Downstairs there was a large breakfast room with a good selection of food to choose from and, once more the service was faultless.  My only criticism would be that the scrambled eggs were always lukewarm and the coffee wasn't strong enough, but apart from that, everything else was fine.  The hotel also has other amenities, including its own gym and sauna and I instantly regretted not packing my gym kit when I saw how well equipped the gym was!
The North Star is not far from the city centre and most places we wanted to visit were easily within walking distance.  Opposite the hotel is Connolly St train station, handy if you want to take a day trip out and an airport shuttle bus service is available at the hotel for a small fee.
We enjoyed our stay at the hotel very much and, if you are in Dublin for a few days, we would recommend it as a place to stay.",5,2014,12,13
219,Absolutely Fantastic,"From the time we arrived here to the time we left everything here was just fantastic. Every single member of staff were so friendly and welcoming. Reception staff, restaurant staff, bar staff everyone was just wonderful. Our room was fabulous and so comfortable. We ate in the restaurant that evening and the food was gorgeous and all cooked fresh. We retired to the bar later that night after being at a concert in the 3 Arena (the hotel provided a shuttle bus to and from) and it was so friendly relaxed and welcoming. Overall I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.... We just can't wait to visit again soon. ",5,2014,12,12
219,Fantastic. All staff were helpful and attentive and attention to the little details was great. Thank you NORTH STAR,Very clean well presented in every part we were in. We received an upgrade to premier and took full advantage of the amenities available to us from the pent house club room with all day refreshments and free breakfast to sauna and gym. The rooms were immaculate and had everything you need and more. I loved my stay at the North Star and will be staying again very soon. Sinead Maude,5,2014,12,11
219,Fab return visit,"Not our first visit to The North Star Hotel and won't be our last. Havn't been for a few years and were pleasantly surprised by the complete refurbishment of the whole place. We were greeted by a friendly, helpful receptionist and were given our room keys promptly. I went to the bar to get a jug of milk to make a cup of tea in the room and was met by a lovely, smiling bar man, The bar has been completely overhauled and looks fantastic, it was warm and homely and judging by the crowds eating there on a Friday evening, it is frequented by guests and locals alike, Always a good sign to see locals going into a city hotel bar. Though we didn't eat in the bar, the amount of food that was been brought to tables and the look of it tells us that is has to be pretty darn good and we will make it our business to try it next time! 

The room, as before was spacious, spotless and airy but  we were amazed with the beautiful decor and the fact that it was like a mini suite with a kind of seperate little seating area and bathroom off it. We had a really good nights sleep and a lovely, fresh, varied buffet breakfast awaited us the next morning, again it was served by polite, helpful and courteous staff even though they were rushed off their feet. 

Car parking was available to us right beside the hotel for a rate of eight euros per 24 hours and the gentleman in the car park was really nice and helpful.

If you want a really lovely homely hotel with a city centre location with professional staff, then I would highly recommend going no further than the North Star.",5,2014,12,07
219,very good hotel with parking,"couldn't fault this hotel - near citycentre/ 3areana - parking beside it ‚Ç¨8 for 24 hrs. staff  & food very good. very comfy bed - would defo stay there again this hotel would suit any age - will be back

              
              ",4,2014,12,06
219,Good Hotel,"We have just come back from a 5 night stay in this Hotel We were there with our severely disabled son who celebrated his 30th birthday while we were there. It is very hard for us to find a Hotel which has a wheelchair adapted room which can sleep 3 people but the North Star came up trumps. Our room was large with a double & single bed with a sitting area with couch & 2 chairs & a large wet room. The only slight drawback was there was no direct access from reception area to our room without going outside but this did not really bother us at all. Our only other slight complaint was the shower was not very powerful but again this didn't spoil our stay. We were pleased that it was so close to main shopping area & it was a pleasant and more importantly for us pushing a wheelchair, a flat walk. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly & helpfull & food both at breakfast time & in the vening was good We will definitely go back to this hotel next time we are in Dublin.",4,2014,12,06
219,Great Hotel,Stayed here in November for 2 nights with friends.  Have stayed here before a few times.  We were upgraded to Premiere Rooms which was a wonderful surprise.  We had a great time the staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble.  Really close to train and bus stations and a short walk into the centre.  Really looking forward to returning there again.  North Star cannot thank you enough for a great time.  Our friends were really impressed also and said they will return again.,5,2014,12,05
219,A great hotel,"I booked this hotel for a couple of nights stay in November and what I found was a great hotel.
Located a few minutes walk from O'Connell Street, The Liffey and various other places in Dublin it was ideal for me and at ¬£119 for the 2 nights was well worth the money.

The staff were welcoming and helpful, the hotel and room were very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was superb you could easily have enough to eat to last you the day.

On returning home I discovered I left the gifts I had bought for my family at the hotel but they sent the items to Edinburgh for me which was great, all in all a great experiance and would happily stay again and recommend highly to others.",5,2014,12,04
219,This was a surprise weekend for my now fianc√©,"I stayed here in the Oscar Wild suite. Was impressed by the room although it was pretty bare. It could have been doing with a mini bar and maybe snacks seeing as it was a suite. Clean, decent location and the staff were very helpful. I decided to dine in the restaurant that evening and chose the steak option. I was very disappointed as the meat was extremely fatty. I left the steak and when the bill came they had taken the ""supplement"" charge off the meal and not the actual steak. Told the waitress I was not paying for a steak I didn't eat and she came back after speaking to the manager to say it had been removed from the bill. I am really fussy when it comes to steak but when it's a fatty as it was I knew it wasn't a great cut. The chef was not to blame at all here as u can only do so much with the tools u have as they say. I would definitely stay here again tho because my fianc√© and I did enjoy the trip overall. ",4,2014,12,03
219,Good all round hotel,"Stayed here in November while visiting family, very nice looking hotel. Didn't spend much time in the hotel using the facilities but that bar is very nice. Booked breakfast for one day missed it due to myself reading the wrong times, the staff agreed to change it to another day which was very helpful and much appreciated. The breakfast itself was 10/10. The only negative I would give the hotel is our room looked directly out onto the railway track.  ",4,2014,12,03
219,An unexpected gem,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights recently.  The hotel is situated less than 5 mins from the Airlink bus stop.  Check in was easy and we were allocated a room on the 6th floor right at the end of the building.  The room was of good quality with nice fixtures and furnishings and a lovely big bed.  The room looked out onto a quiet back road with residential apartments so we weren't bothered by noise of trains, roads, etc.  
Towels, soap, shampoo and shower gel are all provided within the bathroom
Breakfast everyday was a buffet style but with plenty of options for your 'full Irish', as well as cereals, fruits and yoghurts.
The location is good in terms of access to trains, trams and buses, although a few of the roads behind the hotel were full of some unsavoury characters, but hey, it was Saturday night after all.  Please don't this detract from what is a wonderful hotel and one which I certainly wouldn't hesitate in staying in again should I stay in Dublin",5,2014,12,03
219,Vacation to Ireland,"My daughter and I went to Ireland in Oct 2014. We took a package thru Groupon and everything went like clock work. Our hotels were wonderful along with the train rides. The people are so friendly. We went to Dublin, my favorite fun city. Then to Limerick. Then to Cork to see the Blarney Stone then we were off to Galway. We saw the Cliffs of Moher they were breath taking!!
Had all the Irish food wish was delish and saw so many other sites. The hotels were we stayed in were great! Will go again in the future.",5,2014,12,02
219,Absolutely brilliant,"I have recently returned from a weekend away staying in the North Star hotel and I cannot fault the place. I took my boyfriend away for a surprise birthday weekend and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was exceptional, even before we got there. Nothing was too much to ask. We arrived at the hotel at around 8 in the morning and although our room wasn't ready for check in, they took our bags and put them in storage so we could wander around Dublin without having to lug the cases. It is about a 10 minute walk from the heart of the centre and the main shopping area. Just far enough out of the way so it is quiet. 

When we checked in, we were allocated room 566. The room was spacious and exceptionally clean and modern. It was lovely. I was slightly worried that we might hear the trains passing on the bridge overhead but can honestly say we didn't hear a thing. We also had complimentary robes and slippers which, for the price I paid, I wasn't expecting at all. 

Breakfast was beautiful and fresh and the staff also kept hold of our luggage on the Sunday as we weren't flying back until late. We used the shuttle service that the hotel offers both ways and it was so quick, convenient and cheap at ‚Ç¨5 each.

Dublin is a beautiful and friendly place, albeit, it is very expensive so make sure you have lots of spending money! We were paying around ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨11 for 2 drinks (a pint and a half!). We went on a trip up to Northern Ireland on the Sunday which was also great and very picturesque. 

I can't recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be back to stay again. Absolutely fantastic place with fantastic staff. Next time we will definitely try the hotel's restaurant as the food looked amazing! 

Thank you North Star for a memorable stay and a brilliant birthday treat for my partner! ",5,2014,12,01
219,An Early Christmas,"My boyfriend and I stayed stayed for a weekend in November as I live in Scotland and he was going abroad with work for 6 months. As we were going to be missing our first Christmas together, I asked the hotel if there was any chance they could help me surprise him with an early Christmas. Straight away I was told it they would take care of all the arrangements and when we turned up, our room was decorated in a lovely Christmas theme with loads of Christmas lights, Christmas trees and snowflakes. It really made our weekend extra special and we hadn't a bad word to say about the staff or the hotel itself. We are already planning our next stay there :)",5,2014,12,01
219,ireland,The north star is a little out of city center but well worth the stay.  The hotel is 1 block away from the drop off point for the airlink bus from the airport.  The airlink is only 6 euros.  The staff at the hotel were exceptional. Always helpful whether it be room service or directions on public transportation.  The hotel is within walking distance or a bus ride to all the major sites in dublin.  The room was clean and comfortable.,4,2014,11,30
219,All that need,"I needed an overnight stay in Dublin close to the city centre. North Star looked the right one and it proved to be the perfect choice. No regrets. My room on the 5th floor was spacious and comfortable. Clan linen and bathroom. Walking distance to just about everything. The breakfast was as good as any. If I need accommodation in Dublin this will be my choice again.
The reception desk was helpful. I really appreciated the use of the Gym change rooms for a shower and change of cloths in the evening before my trip to the airport, long after I had checked out.
Thank you.",4,2014,11,29
219,Excellent,"The hotel is newly renovated, but some areas were not so ensure to request for the renovated rooms. The room is clean, big and nice. The hotel is near the tram station and the bus going to the airport. It is also near the connell st which is the city proper area. Highly recommended.",4,2014,11,27
219,Great location ,"I booked this hotel as a last minute deal for Dublin.
What a great location , firstly the airport bus drops you off just around the corner.
The hotel itself was clean welcoming and staff were great.
Right next to tram and bus station
15 minute walk in to the city passing lots of nice shops, pubs and restaurants.
Malloy pub is just around the corner and with Guinness at ‚Ç¨4 a pint you can't go wrong.
Our room was 108 and was huge, clean and kept nice and warm.
Our friends stayed 102 they had more of an unsettled nights sleep due to doors banging etc. Opposite their room was the maids room and they were always in and out.
Breakfast was perfect all you can eat Buffett, nice and fresh sets you up for the day.
Would recommend this every day of the week. ",5,2014,11,27
219,Excellent,"Our stay was awesome. The rooms were newly renovated, nice toilets, high speed wifi, clean and helpful staffs.it is near in one of the tram stations and it is very near to the first mcgettigans restaurant. The city proper is a walking distance from the hotel.",4,2014,11,26
219,Had it's ups and downs!,"Booked here for one night for a concert, as they run a shuttle bus to the venue-great! And it's across the road from the train station. When we arrived at 2pm we were greeted by a slight sewage smell (it disappeared that night but was back in the morning?), it wasn't that bad, and was only in the reception area. A lovely woman checked us in promptly and we went to our room happily. She checked us in too prompt however, as at 7 o'clock that evening 3 lovely German people walked into our room demanding to know what we were doing in their room! The woman hadn't checked us in properly and our room was registered empty. However the manager sorted it out, and we got free cocktails and a breakfast upgrade. Otherwise the room was nice, a bit dated but the beds were really soft and the room lovely and warm! The shower was a bit of a disaster, no hot water or power. The door didn't lock either, which we were concerned about due to the earlier incident, so we slept with a chair against the door to prevent any other intruders! Breakfast was lovely, the stay was great value for money and if I will be staying again for future concerts, or one night trips, but not long term stay. ",4,2014,11,26
219,Best hotel around,Stayed with my mum for two nights in one of the premier rooms. Room was beautiful and very spacious.  Restaurant and bar was gorgeous and staff were second to none.  I would definitely recommend to everyone,5,2014,11,25
219,"North Star Hotel, Dublin","Location is good as the Luas light rail stops across the street.The hotel is 4 star which is hard to believe.Can't comment on the food as we did'nt eat there.The room was nice but the view from the window was of part of a roof, no view really.I would say that for a night or two it's adequate.",3,2014,11,25
219,Great place to stay - would stop here again,"Came to dublin for 2 nights and this place was in a great location. On arrival a room was ready at 10.30 but this was in the old side of the building, why we believe to be closest to the train line, possibly noisier. So we waited for another room, just in case. 

Room we had was fine, nothing spectacular but not bad for the price. 

We paid for breakfast in the price and that's a must! Great choice and was all fantastic, certainly best part of the stay here. 

Staff were friendly and helpful, guiding us were we wanted to go from a map. 

We obtained leap visitor cards, ‚Ç¨19.50 each which got us from airport to hotel returned and usage of trains and trams for the 3 days! Again another must as once you're familiar with Dublin you can hop on and off the tram into and out of centre all the time! Must have saved us a fortune.

Only small bad point of hotel was that they didn't replace our towels after the first night. But if we're that bothered we would have asked them to and I'm sure they would have obliged. 

Oh, and Dublin is as expensive as London, if not more expensive but something you can't hold back on! 

Lovely Irish music in friendly (but very busy) bars and we even found a lovely Thai place ",5,2014,11,25
219,Would def stay again,"Perfect location, cosy and clean. Great value for money. Beds were so comfortable. I would def recommend this hotel for convenience and a comfortable stay. The luas and Connolly station is right across the street, 3 stops away( 5 mins) and your in the middle of everything the city has to offer. Only downfall about the room was the sink, when u turn on the tap to wash your hands or brush your teeth the sink fills up with water immediately and takes ages to clear. ",4,2014,11,25
219,Nice little hotel,"Hotel was terrific. Shuttle picked us up from airport, no charge. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. Fairly close to O'Connell St., able to walk there in 15 min or less. Bus and train stations very close. Rooms nicely done. I would stay there again!",5,2014,11,24
219,"Lovely hotel, staff very friendly and welcoming","Would defianately go back, the hotel was lovely staff were all friendly and very welcoming especially the bar staff who worked very hard. 
About a ten minute walk from the centre but lovely walk along the river. 
Rooms were always lovely and clean and also very spacious.
Right outside was a taxi rank train station and tram station so plenty of options to get about.
Ideal as most hotels in the city were amongst the noise of the nightlife.",5,2014,11,24
219,Not too shabby,"Great location! slightly dated room but perfectly fine for a city break. most of the hotel has been updated however we ended up in one of the older rooms. slightly expensive breakfast option as an add-on, so we opted out.",4,2014,11,24
219,"Lovely Hotel, Friendly staff","This is a lovely hotel with friendly staff and nice rooms only thing was our room was right next to the train lines so had trains running from early morning and the rooms where very hot with no control over the heating, prices in the bar were reasonable and very nice relaxing atmosphere breakfast was very good with lots of choice and again very friendly helpful staff.",4,2014,11,24
219,2 Night Trip to Dublin,"This hotel is great, the staff very friendly and helpful. the rooms are modern and clean with tea and coffee in them. The breakfast is also great, if you like bacon it's back not streaky like on the cruises.The Airlink bus drops you off 100 metres from the hotel for 10 Euros return,  It's only a 5 minute walk to the Spike in the city centre or you can take a tram from across the road to the GUINNESS STOREHOUSE experience. I know were we are going to stay when we return to Dublin.. no brainer",5,2014,11,24
219,WOW Had a fabulous time.,"Just returned from 2 nights (3 days) with a groupon voucher to this hotel.  We travel with our son and daughter-in-law, and we flew from Stanstead Airport.  I have never travel with Ryanair, and after hearing all the terrible reviews, I was very, very anxious.  But without cause.  The airportand flight staff were lovely, it was so easy, we just arrived and went through security and then when the time came, got on the plane.  No-one said my bag was too big, which it wasn't, but some went through with enormous bags and no-one stopped them.. The hotel is absolutely lovely.  the rooms, the beds, the staff the food ....ALL excellent.  It poured with rain the first day, but we still had a great time.  We went to the Brewery, The castle, National Museum, The Natural History Museum, The Prison, A cruise on the river and best of all we went on THE GHOST BUS !!! Great fun.  The Irish people are lovely.  can't say enough good things about this hotel, places to visit and the people.  THANKS.",5,2014,11,24
219,"Great Service, Great Location","The staff here was so helpful and friendly.  Rooms were clean and modern.  Breakfast is great, and from the hotel we were less than a 10 minute walk to O'Connell St and about 15-20 minutes to Trinity College and Grafton St.",5,2014,11,24
219,Can't complain.,Very clean with very pleasant staff to boot.  Excellent buffet breakfast. Convenient 10 minute walk to the the three arena and local shops.  There is also a useful shuttle bus to and from the airport.  Will be staying here the next time I'm in Dublin.,5,2014,11,24
219,John f,"The first time we have been to Ireland we stayed in the North Star hotel the staff were very friendly and always ready to help you .the rooms were excellent we only had the cheaper room with was great ,the hotel is close to the town and the tram over the road to catch into town defenatly stay there again .",5,2014,11,23
219,clean and well presented,The d√©cor was nice and everywhere was clean and well maintained. Staff were pleasant and helpful and the location was within about 10-15 minutes walk of O'Connell street. It was convenient for airport bus but also had a shuttle bus which could be booked at reception to go to airport if it was suitable to your departure time. There was a good selection for breakfast.,4,2014,11,19
219,"Overall, a great stay.","The hotel is quaint and has old charm, but has been remodeled.  The remodeling isn't the greatest (the handle in the shower came right out of the wall when I grabbed it, for instance) but it's beautiful nonetheless.  The hotel is very clean, and close to many great shops, restaurants, and conveniently close to Connolly Station (across the street), the Luas, and the bus stop.  The staff are superb!  Very friendly and helpful.  Would recommend to anyone!",4,2014,11,19
219,Great location!!,"This hotel is great for travelling around Dublin. Literally across the street from Connelly Station, 10 minutes from O'Connell Street where you can catch the HoHo sightseeing bus tours and 20 minute walk from the o2/3 arena if you are going to a show. I did all of the above easily and saved a fortune on transport costs. The staff are excellent, really seem happy in their job and always aiming to do their best.

Only two very small negatives, the rooms in the hotel, I stayed in 269 are noisy and a bit tired (especially the bathrooms) but serviceable and as we were busy out and about we didn't mind. However they have got to do something about the sewer smell in the lobby very off putting.

I didn't really fancy the food in McGettigans. We shared a slider platter and the beef burgers were very tough and the chicken had a lot of veins and sinew which wasn't nice. Chips and cocktails were good though.",3,2014,11,18
219,Nice,This was our 4th time staying in the north star. It is very conveniently located beside the luas and right across from Connolly station. Only downside is the noise of the trains in early morning. Very clean and beautiful decor,5,2014,11,16
219,One night in Dublin,"I would recommend The North Star Hotel every time! We received a very pleasant welcome from the staff on arrival. The beds was comfortable, bathroom a good size and plenty of hot water:-). Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice and the Irish soda bread was delicious. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,16
219,Great location and handy to the train station.,Apart from the cleaning staff entering the room while we where sleeping everything else was great! Staff where pleasant and helpful. Room was clean and good value. Overall a great hotel and in a good location,4,2014,11,16
219,Cannot fault this hotel,"The staff are excellent, the food is fabulous (especially the breakfast buffet).  Cannot fault this hotel at all, had a great time.  Directly opposite the train station and just a short walk to O'Connell Street.",5,2014,11,16
219,Great nights's stay,"I am just home from an overnight stay in the North Star with my daughters and daughter-in-law. We had booked a room for four and were delighted to have been upgraded to a suite. Everything was spotless, comfortable and spacious and the hotel was conveniently situated for travel, shopping and for restaurants.  The breakfast this morning was plentiful and so good.  What can I say other than a good all round experience at a very good price.",4,2014,11,16
219,My double North Star stay,The room(s) were really nice. Only thing I would have changed it was so hot in the room while we tried to sleep and I wasn't able to bring the temp down at all. The location was excellent. Right next to the luas at Connolly station.,4,2014,11,16
219,A Dublin Welcome,"We popped over for the weekend and could not find fault with this hotel. The rooms were great and the staff even better. 
A great way to spend a weekend at a great price. 
I wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel in the future. ",5,2014,11,16
219,Amazing hotel,"I flew over from london to see a beyonce concert and stayed at this hotel. It was the best hotel i have ever stayed at. Everyone had a smile on their face and were very friendly. The hotel offered a bus to the concert for a few euro which was amazing and took any stress off travelling out of the way. The rooms were amazing , modern and spotless! In my opinion this is the best hotel in dublin! My visit here could not have been better",5,2014,11,15
219,"Thank you, Dubliners","A recent (Oct. 28 to Nov. 5) trip to Dublin was wonderful. We stayed at the North Star and it could not have been any better! Hotel staff that goes 'beyond the call', accommodations were excellent, and breakfast every morning was great way to start off the day! Rooms immaculate. Directly across the street from train Connolly train station and cab pick up.",5,2014,11,15
219,Customer service at its best,"I highly recommend this hotel based on the location, customer service, amenities and very modest price. Suits business person and tourist alike.

The welcome was warm, staff are multilingual and attentive. The hotel is modern with rooms well equiped. Bathrooms are modern and pleasant. The bed is huge and room generally large and clean. 

The breakfast was abundant, hot food and continental. Staff at breakfast were friendly and helpful.

The hotel has a lounge and gym. The gym is open until 11pm. Machines are a little dated but fully functioning and certainly more than enough for a solid workout after a day of business meetings. Big plus are the free weights, kettle and bar bells. Dont often see them in hotel gyms.

There is a sauna but I didn't use it.

Central location, 5 mintes from the financial district and also close to local shopping areas.

Most impressive was the manner in which the staff ensured I got my phone back after I had forgotten it at the hotel. I was already at the airport. They found the phone then arranged for it to be delivered to me at the airport during rush hour, all before I took off. Thank you once again.",5,2014,11,14
219,Marvelous place to visit !!!,"I am really pleased to say that my business trip to Dublin was amazingly calm and soothing because of my stay at this hotel. Lovely environment and clean confortable rooms with excellant services. Staff is really helpful and hospitable specially Diana was really an exceptionally great personality. I wish I visit again very soon.

Regard,

219,lovely stay,"Stayed here for one night with my fiance.we stayed in the king premier room.spotless bathroom, flat screen tv, mini bar, tea and cofee making facilities, king size bed, nice decor and a balcony.use of the premier lounge when you can get free bottled water, biscuits, tea and coffee.dinner in mcgettigans bar downstairs was really nice.i had the goats cheese spring rolls and the beef burger.staff were very friendly.couldnt fault the place!",5,2014,11,13
219,great hotel,stayed at the north star for 1 night in November 3 middle age men going to a concert at the three arena. room was excellent the breakfast the next day was excellent location of the hotel was good.25 euro in taxi from airport 15 mins.tram stop 2 mins away 2.6 euro to arena. would recommend this hotel to friends .,5,2014,11,13
219,Back for 2nd Time,"This hotel keeps improving the room we were in had two flat screen Televisions and was very spacious.I was a bit worried at first when I saw the train track from my window but it didnt really bother us,the trains go past slowly but if you are a light sleeper ask for a room at the other side of the hotel.The hotel offers parking for a small fee each day,you get free Wifi and I must say a great breakfast,you help yourself to as much as you like and its delicious.the staff are first class also very polite The walk to Temple bar area is about 15 minutes its in a great location,Will be back again next year for sure.",5,2014,11,12
219,Worst hotel of our trip,"We are at the end of our trip and Ireland and have stayed at 2 other hotels and had wonderful experinces... until we checked in here.

We have been here for 1 hour and the following has been our experience thus far:

-unfriendly check in staff
-I have a visible handicap and when asking for an elevator the staff member told us the stairs were the way to get to our room was the stairs. He didn't offer to help us with our bags and we are two females traveling. We had to travel up 2 flights of stairs and back down another (total maze) to get to our room.
-bathroom floor looks dirty and has hair and left over soap in shower
-our windows are blacked out???
-probably to hide the loud train or something that runs next to our room and the alarm going off in the alley
-our room smells like roach spray and smoke
-can hear every door that is shut in our hallway and every step taken above us
-and we have 12 channels to choose from to mask all the multiple noises. 

Wish us luck for the next 2 nights as the first hour has been terrible! :(

This ",1,2014,11,12
219,Thoroughly enjoyable stay for my 2nd time in Dublin,"I actually stayed in this hotel with my partner in January 2014 but I have booked a return visit with some friends for Feb 2015 for the same hotel :)

Location

Fab - only 10 min walk into the centre. Close enough to Temple Bar to stumble back after a night out! Really easy to find way back.
The bus you can catch from airport which runs to centre of Dublin stops no more than a 2 min walk from the hotel which is perfect.

Room

Our room was lovely - nicely decorated, very comfortable bed. Tea and coffee facilities. Flat screen TV. Small fridge/mini bar. It was my birthday the day before we travelled so I emailed the hotel to request a possible cheeky birthday treat room upgrade and when we arrived we were told that the request was granted. We arrived very early in the morning but the gent at reception said the room was ready so we could check in early.

Breakfast

Yummy - nice produce, plenty of choice, waitresses will bring you tea/coffee. Everything else is buffet style and was very tasty - my only criticism of the breakfast was that it was quite cold one morning so we went down earlier the next day and it was cold again but this was in Jan 14 so hopefully the hotel may have upped the temperature of the food since then!

Facilities

Didn't try the cookhouse restaurant but it always looked nice in there and quite busy. The reception area is well decorated and staff were friendly and approachable.
There is a lift which we took up from breakfast in the basement in the mornings and we found a couple of times it did break and there were some intermittent problems with it so we'd like to think this has now been resolved because let's face it - who wants to take the stairs after overdosing on Irish sausages and bacon?!

Things To Do

There's loads of things to do in Dublin - we did a free walking tour of the city with New Europe and tipped generously at the end as it was free. We also did the New Europe bar crawl. Did a lot of the tourist type things like Book of Kells, Temple Bar, Christchurch Cathedral, Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin Zoo etc. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel to friends and family and I'm clearly keen as we're going back a 2nd time!",4,2014,11,12
219,An under rated surprise in a great location,"Stayed one night on Business
Car parking was Key for me but everything else was very good & I will return
Great room - with WiFi - near all city centre venues - very good breakfast & overall place was very good value.
Staff very helpfull - overall a good experience.",4,2014,11,12
219,Poor lounge service,"Pleasant staff. The absolute worst service in the lounge. No drinks or snacks throughout the stay. I'm talking about the executive lounge which would provide breakfast and beautiful pastries according to photos and information on the website. Booked this hotel for a special occasion and are very disappointed. It really was not worth the money. I'm very disappointed and would like to have compensation due to no breakfast, snacks and drinks.",2,2014,11,12
219,"Central Location, very nice hotel","I stayed with a friend for 4 nights and we really liked the hotel. The breakfast buffet was EXCELLENT. The staff was very friendly and helpful. (the concierge was so so nice... we picked his brain a few times).
We were concerned as our taxi driver warned us that this hotel was in a ""bad part of town"" but we found that to be not true at all. The neighborhood was perfectly nice and very close to the tourist sites in Dublin. We also took a train from Connelly station and it's literally across the street.
The only downside was that there were two sets of stairs (one long and one short) to reach the elevator to our room. My friend is 7 months pregnant and I'm not getting any younger so it was something to carry the bags (though, if we had asked, someone would have carried them for us) but that was no way a deal breaker. The hotel was great.",4,2014,11,12
219,not a 4 star,"nice hotel,great location but shower in the room was very poor for a 4star hotel.lovely buffet breakfast which was nice and hot.within easy walking distance of o'connell st and temple bar.right next to bus and train station.",3,2014,11,12
219,"Friendly staff, a little run down","Stayed her during the Dublin Web Summit. Very close to the railway station, however the entire place vibrated as trains passed. Shower in my room was poor with very little water flow, room had a stale smell. The decor was nice and staff very friendly however I feel the place was a little run down.",3,2014,11,11
219,Great Location,"The hotel was in a great location easy to walk to all attractions in Dublin.  We booked as part of a larger package and both stays at the beginning and end of the trip we were placed in rooms just over the restaurant.  I only mention this as the music came up through the floor very loudly making hard for my mother to sleep.  So if you get a deal and are not planning on staying out late try to avoid the ""100"" rooms in the front of the hotel.  Other than that this would have been a perfect stay,",4,2014,11,11
219,Nice hotel great location,"We really enjoyed our stay at the North Star Hotel. It was within walking distance of most of the points of interest in Dublin and many pubs and restaurants and directly next to Connolly Station. It was very easy to get to the hotel on the Paddywagon shuttle. Our room was even ready when we arrived at 9:00am! The staff was very accommodating and friendly. 

There were a few downsides to the hotel. Though they were not major and I still wholeheartedly recommend this hotel, I feel like I should mention them if I want to be helpful! 1) no elevator, 2) the trains at nearby Connolly Station could be a little disturbing sometimes, and 3) the front door was locked late at night and we had to ring the doorbell to get in. It wasn't a huge inconvenience, but it was a little bit bothersome. 

All in all, I definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin!",5,2014,11,10
219,Bistro/Bar review,"I have not stayed in the hotel so am giving 4 stars based on what I have seen at entrance level and in the bar. I had lunch there on two occasions now and have found the food very good, the prices reasonable, the bar stafff excellent and very friendly.  The ambience was very pleasant at lunch time and the facilities were excellent. A nice place to meet friends for lunch on this side of the city, in my experience.",4,2014,11,10
219,Perfect for city break,"All staff were accommodating and pleasant, from arrival to departure. As we arrived, my boyfriend and I were treated to a complimentary room upgrade, and a free glass of prosecco in the restaurant/bar. We had breakfast included which was brilliant, had everything we needed to fill us up for the day of sight-seeing we planned. The meal we had in the restaurant was also lovely, all staff were helpful and polite. The room was very clean, modern and spacious. We had no issues or problems at all throughout our stay. If we return to Dublin, we will make sure to stay at the North Star Hotel.",5,2014,11,09
219,Good hotel,"Stayed for one night.  Weather was atrocious, difficult to blame that on the hotel, so never really got a feel for location as went everywhere by taxi - which was easy as there was a rank outside the hotel.  Room was nice, bed comfortable, all the facillities you need, plus a nice breakfast.  My room was at the back, so was nice and quiet.  Odd to walk up a long corridor from reception to get the lift, but the odd little quirk adds to the character of the place.",4,2014,11,09
219,Thank you for a great stay again,"Returned to stay in the North Star Hotel again the week before last while on a training course in Dublin.  I just can not fault this Hotel.  Just a few stops on the Luas from Heuston Station it could not be more centrally located.

I was met on arrival by the Manager. She remembered me from my last stay, which was impressive as I am sure she meets hundreds of people every day,  The girl on reception was so lovely and had me checked in in no time at all.

I had booked an executive room, which was on the 7th floor overlooking Connolly Station with its own private balcony. Thought there might be alot of noise from the trains, but because of the double glazed windows it was not a problem.  The bed was the best i have ever slept in when staying in a hotel. It was a huge King size bed with snow white linen. So so comfortable

I ordered room service on both nights..........Ribs the first night and fish & chips the second night.  Both were delicious and I was treated to a glass of Processo with each meal.  I could have had breakfast in the executive lounge on my floor, but chose to eat in the breakfast room on the bottom floor.  The buffet selection is great, just help yourself to as much as you want and within minutes of ordering my pot of tea it was on my table waiting for me when I finished getting my breakfast at the buffet.

I will definitely be staying in this hotel again when back in Dublin.  From start to finish I could not fault anything.  The staff are a credit to the hotel, so friendly, helpful and professional.  

Thank you North Star Hotel.  So you all again soon.",5,2014,11,08
219,Brilliant short break,"The Staff were all very pleasant and helpful throughout our 4 day stay. Our room was spacious and well equipped. Even though we were on the front of the hotel where it could be noisy, the double glazing prevented any noise disturbances. The bar was good and the outdoor drinking area was well heated and decorated.
We will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2014,11,07
219,Ok,"The hotel is next to the station. Not too far from O'Connell street, but not as central as other hotels, taxi to Temple Bar cost less than 5 euro.
Beds were very comfy, the showers not great, towels minute.
Rooms very clean, breakfast good, bistro bar food ok, had better in Temple bar area.
Staff extremely helpful, although our travelling companions would not agree with this as they complained about the window needing sorting in their room as it did not close properly hence the room was too noisy and therefore lack of sleep due to the noise then in the room, they asked for it to be sorted and had to push the matter before they could get anything done.
Overall an ok hotel, but there are cheaper ones in Dublin of the same quality.",3,2014,11,04
219,Lovely Hotel!,"lovely rooms, lovely decoration! Delicious food and friendly staff!
The only thing that bothered me was the smell at the reception, the rest of the hotel smells good!
In addition the hotel is in the city center, so it's near to the pub area, the main landmarks..",4,2014,11,04
219,Outstanding! Return would not be questionable!,"This hotel was superb, a stones throw away from everything, great rooms, great staff and couldn't name a single fault. 

Accessible transport links nearby, and airport links available to and from the hotel directly! 

Would return in the future, great weekend away",5,2014,11,04
219,monday madness,"my best friend came over for one night in Dublin 46 sterling for us a real treat. we arrived early n were given a room at the front. it was noisy as opposite connolly stn n stuffy they moved us to a rear room which was peaceful n well decorated, bathroom was lovely too. single beds x2 were comfy. staff were friendly and helpful. the bar is great especially garden area enclose non smoking all lanterns n cushions great for a chat.the breakfast was hot and yummy lots of choice and as self serving you could pick portion size.the gymn n lounge looked brill.the hotel is central to famine statues , and a short walk to oconnell st i,d definately recommend a stay here.",5,2014,11,04
219,Brilliant Hotel,"I have just returned from a two night stay with a large group of friends and have only good things to say about this hotel.  From arrival to departure the customer service was second to none and our visit to Dublin was enhanced by staying there. Rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean, the restaurant provided a menu with lots of choice and reasonably priced and the food was lovely. The location is perfect with all modes of transport for sightseeing on your door step. The staff were fantastic and went out of there way to ensure customer satisfaction. The manager Claire obviously takes great pride in making sure you enjoy your stay and made us feel so welcome. Although we had arrived to late for the lunchtime menu we were able to reserve our choice of food beforehand which was served to us on arrival with complimentary proseco to toast the bride to be.  This is an all round fantastic hotel and everyone in our group has said when they revisit Dublin this is the hotel they will be staying. Looking forward to visiting again soon.",5,2014,11,04
219,"Nice hotel, convenient to transportation and close to several attractions","I recently returned from a 10 day trip to Dublin, Ireland (10/6/14-10/16/14).  I stayed at the North Star Hotel in Dublin.  It was a nice hotel, the photos they post are very accurate.  You are across the street from the DART station (their subway), the LUAS (a cable car that runs on tracks) is also across the street,and they have several buses that take you right to several attractions in the City Centre area or you could even walk (about 10 minutes, and I really mean 10 minutes even for an overweight 50 year old with a recently healing fracture to my left foot and with some herniated and bulging discs in my neck) to the Giant Spire (which is like the center of Dublin or at least most of the attractions).  The lobby is very cozy with several tables and chairs so you can sit while you wait.  The front desk staff are very friendly and try to be helpful although not all of them are as familiar with how to get to certain attractions.  Thank you Lorna for going the extra mile to help me out with several things I asked of you.  You were a life saver!  Some of the furniture looks a little worn and could use a little sprucing up but the color scheme is nice and very warm and homey.  It is a little inconvenient to have to climb the stairs and walk that long corridor to get to the elevator.  I was in room 360 and the air conditioner was fine and I didn't really hear too much street noise or train noise.  The walls however were a little thin and I heard the doors slamming a lot.  The beds were comfortable, but the carpet could have been a little cleaner.  I also did not have any facial tissues in the room the whole time I was there.  It was a little strange to have a hair dresser in the drawer with the plug through a hole in the back so that I couldn't remove it completely to make room for my clothes.  There were definitely not enough drawers to put my clothes into.  The bathtub is nice and deep but it was strange to the the hot and cold water come out in separate spigots.  The water pressure in the shower was awful!  When you turned the water toward hot, the water pressure went almost to a trickle,  I had to take cool showers to get any water pressure and since you couldn't bring the shower head down, it was hard to clean your private area unless you take a cup into the shower so you can get some water down there.  It was very convenient to have a restaurant on site since I came back some days so tired that I didn't feel like going back out and they have a SPAR (kind of like a Seven Eleven or bodega) on the corner and a pub on the corner and some more restaurants and pubs within a couple of blocks.  There were several nights when I returned to the hotel with swollen ankles and I ordered buckets of ice to ice down my ankles and they were always very accommodating.  Their front desk staff were very nice, however I did have a couple of problems when I was checking out.  They were updating their computer system and first they had a charge on my bill that I did not incur, then they told me I owed them money for a room and I told then that it was prepaid with Travelocity and I was told that they had me in the system with 2 rooms.  How does one person use two rooms?  I know the information is contradictory about the wi-fi, but it is free for hotel guests, in fact, in Dublin, there is free wi-fi almost everywhere (on the bus, trains, etc.). They also offer a shuttle service, when you arrive, you might want to use the airport shuttle service which cost 6 euros per person since they run every 15 minutes and leaves you around the corner from the hotel, but if you have 3 or 4 people, it might be worth it to take a taxi.  When you are going back to the airport though, you could use their shuttle instead, since the driver comes into the lobby to pick you up, the only thing is the shuttle only runs to the airport once every 2 hours, also you have a long walk to the terminals from where the shuttle bus drops you off.",4,2014,11,03
219,Good in some ways but improvement needed,"Three for us stayed here for a few days. The hotel is decorated very nicely and definitely appeals from that perspective. The service from the staff is good and the rooms were clean and comfy. The hotel was nice and warm. However, where improvements could be made are: the avoidance of doors being slammed by staff in the morning, the bathroom we had could have had an electric ventilator as some of the tiles in the bathroom were a bit mouldy, there was a strange smell in the lobby area (smelt damp) and the food we had as part of the room service lacked flavour. Overall a good hotel but not worth the cost we paid. If it was cheaper or improvements made as above then I would consider staying again. ",3,2014,11,03
219,First Stay,"Stayed here for the first time for 3 nights.  The hotel was lovely and the staff very helpful.  Only issue was the room, we unexpectedly had a suite for just the two of us which was a lovely size and very clean...but was on the 1st floor (room 169) - if you are a light sleeper do not expect much sleep.  Very noisy with the outside trains, when the window is shut the air conditioning needed to be on which also made one loud racket and without the air con on the room was far too hot.  Being on the low floor also meant that your room had a strong smell of the breakfast every morning.  Other than the noise and smell no issues at all.  Would happily stay again but would request at time of booking a higher floor or the premier suites.

Highly recommend the breakfast it was lovely and lots of choice.

The Cookhouse and Grill Bar and Restaurant I also highly recommend.

Location - is about a 10 minute walk to the the Temple Bar Area but is next to bus stops, Laus and Dart stops which can take you everywhere and anywhere.  We paid 19.50 Euros each for a Leap Visitor card at the Spar at Dublin Airport which covers all methods of transport including the bus from and to Dublin Airport a bargain for three days travel especially if you do not want to walk everywhere.  We used our pass with an App/Website call hittheroad.ie which told us which bus/laus/dart to get on from the hotel (or nearby) to get us to whichever attraction we wanted to see.

Would defiantly stay here again just a different room/floor.",4,2014,11,03
219,Lovely hotel ,Had a lovely stay here room was nice and spacious. It is a short walk to O'Connell St and other local attractions. Spent 2 nights here. Food in the restaurant was very enjoyable and staff was very friendly we have booked up to stay next June as well would recommend it.,5,2014,11,02
219,4th time to stay here,"just returned home from our 4th stay here. i had emailed before and requested a high floor, quiet room. i got a reply email saying that my agent had booked a twin room but they would change it to a double room. i was also offered an upgrade at a small cost but declined. however on arrival to the hotel the receptionist couldnt find our booking. they asked for confirmation and took my letter away. we were asked to take a seat and wait. they then said that all was ok and booked us in. we were allocated room 467. this room had a single bed and a double bed. this was the highest floor before the executive rooms. my heart did sink when i seen that the trains were running in front of our window and were very noisy even with the window shut. however they did stop around midnight and started again around 6.45 in the morning. all the rooms on that side with uneven numbers were facing the train track. the room and bathroom were clean but a bit dated as was the old tv. we had tea and coffee making facilities, a safe and an iron and ironing board. the breakfast was fantastic and hot with lots of choices. all the staff were pleasent at all times. the car park was 8 euros a day and it was packed most of the time but they keep your keys so that you can get out if needed. we didnt eat in the hotel except for breakfast but we did have drinks in the lovely lounge. i will be returning to this hotel because of the location and nice staff and car park but i will probably upgrade to an executive room the next time.",4,2014,11,02
219,Slightly off the Beaten Track,"The hotel is perfectly located for the train station but not central.  It is a good ten minute walk to the Spire on O'connell Street so be prepared for a jaunt or two.  On a nice day this isn't too bad although you will have to pass by some unscrupulous characters on the way.

The hotel is absolutely fine as regard the accommodation,  more low 4 star than high 4 star.  The staff are friendly and helpful and the concierge can assist with trips etc.  You are also able to leave luggage safely for later departures.

What is not to miss is the breakfast.  Service and quality were excellent.

Also recommend the restaurant, the food is top drawer and high quality. The hotel also has a nice bar and a trendy little terrace.

If you are not bothered about the trek to the centre I would recommend.

As you are close to the station,  catch the Dart to Howth.  It's about ‚Ç¨5.75 return (half hour ride) and suddenly you are at a picturesque harbour with great fish restaurants and walks with great views.  Well worth the trip.",3,2014,11,02
219,Poor quality and safety,"We were unhappy we were about our stay at the North Star Hotel on Oct 28 and 29,2014.  When we checked in we asked for an upgrade and were told the hotel was full. Our room number159 was not up to standards we expected.  The ventilation system was not in good operating condition and the temperature could not be adjusted.  Maintenance did come to try to fix the problem, but it was set a one temp. When we tried to adjust it, we couldn‚Äôt.  The fan, blower was very noisy, no matter what speed it was put on. We finally just turned the system off.
The room was located overlooking the parking lot. So we kept our drapes closed at all times for privacy.  The area outside was very noisy as well with other guest coming and going at all hours of the night.   We had 2 very bad nights with little quiet sleep time.  On the morning of Oct 30 at 4:30 am we got up to get ready to catch our bus to the airport.  My wife opened the drapes to see if it was raining, this was the first time we had done this since arriving in the room.  To her surprises the entire right window frame was pushed into the room and touching the drape.  As if someone had pushed it from the outside to gain access. She was horrified to say the least. She had questioned the safety of the room to me when we first arrived and I told her not to worry it would be fine!  Upon checking out 15 minutes later she tried to tell the young man at the front desk twice about the situation, but he was distracted by other people, delivering papers or something else and did not give her his full attention.  We just dropped off our keys and exited the lobby to walk to bus station.
This doesn't speak well of the  staff and hotel safety along with quality of accommodations.",2,2014,11,01

219,North Star Dublin ..Very Good..,"We stayed 3 nights in room 102..easy to get to from 747 airport bus which stops just round the corner 6 euros... From the outside and the street on which its situated  it's not very complimentary..inside you are very pleasantly surprised.Reception area is very welcoming as are all the staff..our room was huge and wasn't part of their executive deal!!..very large double bed ..table and 2 chairs.. very spacious, clean.. Breakfast was great ..buffet style ...not too busy, relaxed atmosphere...Bar area was lively at night situated in the restaurant which was well attended (McGettigans...part of a chain) . Only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars was the noise levels from the room...it was fine for us but if you are a light sleeper..the proximity to the railline could be a problem..All in all would highly recommend as a great base for your stay in Dublin",4,2014,10,31
219,Very nice Hotel,"Don't let the train tracks in the map scare you, spent 4 days in the hotel and never heard a single traing during my stay. It only 4 blocks away of the main avenue and a lovely walk.  the attention was correct and did not had any problems during our stay. Free wifi (limited speed) but ok for texting home. good breakfast, remember to try butter and dairy there, ireland is famous for it and they are correct.  the breakfast hall is big but not really beatiful.  the beds are comfortable and room was good. nothing bad to say about the hotel.  considering the location it's on the border between the nice zone and the ""not so nice zone"" so you should be carefull when walking aorund at night, if walking at night just remember to take  right as soon as you leave the hotel and you should be nice, went walking every night and nothing happened,  but you moight see a few scary faces...
the hotel has coach services to the airport, remember to check those to save a lot of money!",4,2014,10,30
219,Girly weekend,"Stayed here with 3 friends (‚Ç¨26 taxi from the airport). Left our bags there first thing and went out shopping which isn't a far walk at all, it was a great location! (Minus the train line straight behind but it didn't effect us as we were out during the day and only in for a few hours to get ready and the trains stopped at 12am). 
Very clean and great room service, we asked reception for an iron when we came in as we didn't have one and someone was at our door before we got up and it was only up a few steps to our room... Except the iron burnt a hole through my top :( the iron wasn't even on high! I wasn't impressed and nobody seemed bothered when I mentioned it, never even got a sorry! 
Over all  it was a great weekend :). ",5,2014,10,29
219,Ten minutes from O'Connell Bridge,"Clean, quiet and popular hotel just outside the busy central area. Bed was the most comfy and huge ever slept in. Staff attentive without being obtrusive. Special mention to Paddy and Bruce at the bar. Will stay here again.",5,2014,10,29
219,Excellent hotel,"we have just returned from a 3 night stay at the hotel. Everything was faultless. The staff were extremely helpful throughout. The hotel is in a good location and close to the train station. The breakfast was fantastic with lots of choice, everything was fresh and plentiful. We ate lunch in McGettigans which was excellent and a good price too. We would definitely recommend this hotel and should we return to Dublin in the future will stay there again.",5,2014,10,28
219,brilliant hotel,"excellent hotel, great location and very very clean. Food and drinks were exemplary and was served by nice locals at the bar each night, rooms were very spacious and had everything you could need in them, would recommend",5,2014,10,28
219,Fabulous location and friendly service,"We had a 3 night stay at the North Star Hotel in Dublin. We loved the hotel and the staff were so friendly. The location is fabulous right opposite the train station which makes it ideal for exploring the coast. It is a lovely walk into the centre.  We loved the breakfast selection and lovely eggs and Irish soda bread. We would definitely stay here again. We loved it. We would recommend purchasing a  Leap pass for 3 days unlimited travel on bus, tram and Dart for 19.50 Euros only available at the airport and gives you a transfer into the centre too! Great value. Dublin is a beautiful city and the people are the friendliest people in the world. We felt so at home and they have a fantastic sense of humour which kept us laughing! We cant wait to return to Dublin which now feels like a second home.",5,2014,10,26
219,Weekend in Eire,"First time in Dublin, we arrived at this easily reached hotel, I was really pleasantly surprised when we entered the reception area, I was even happier when they upgraded our room for free.

The rooms are clean and spacious with a Queen sized bed, bathroom was spotless. There is a really nice courtyard outside under the arch of the railway, fully heated wonderful space.

The staff could not do enough for us and were really pleasant especially the older guy in the bar, what a cracking bloke.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",4,2014,10,26
219,Better than I was expecting.. after reading some reviews!,"Stayed 2 nights with hubby. Great Location - right across from Luas & train station. Felt like a rough part of Dublin.
Room - we stayed in standard room..a bit small, but clean. Bed was like a rock! Was woke up during the night with people fighting on the street.
Restaurant - couldn't find a fault..tasty, great service & friendly.
Would come back...

219,A Dublin Gem,"With Canadian friends,my wife and I stayed three nights at this centrally located Dublin Hotel.The welcome was great,the rooms really good,the ambiance impressive and the food most tasty.A breakfast choice to please anyone and the evening restaurant experience was quite special (though disappointingly the ""specials"" were no longer available far too early.The lovely Clare could not have been more apologetic about this and,in fairness,the restaurant had been extremely busy)

The walk to O'Connell Street was not too far but take a brolly if it is raining.

There may be hotels more central but you will not be disappointed if you choose the North Star.It's a ""gem"" in so many ways.",4,2014,10,23
219,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week. Arrived at the hotel around 10.30 and was very surprised that the room was ready. We had room 217 which was at the back of the hotel where the Luas ran but to be honest even with the window opened wasn't too noisy.

The room had 2 single and one double bed, tv, tea making facilities, hairdryer, iron and ironing board.

The room was very clean as was the rest of the hotel.  Breakfast was really great serving cereals, hot food including bacon, sausages, black & white pudding, hash browns, beans and tomatoes.  There was a selection of breads, brown and white for toasting and wheaten bread. There was also a selection of Danish pastries along with the usual meats, cheese, fruits and yoghurts. Everything was fresh and replenished immediately. There was also juices and fresh water.

On the second evening we ate in the McGettigan's restaurant in the hotel and had a very nice meal. The waiter who served us was very pleasant and when my brother in law could not find anything on the dessert menu he found a chocolate muffin for him, free of charge. I think it was from the afternoon teas.

All in all we found this hotel excellent and would definitely go back and would recommend to family and friends.",5,2014,10,22
219,"Great hotel, great staff, great location","Great hotel in a really good location everything is a 5-10 minute walk,very deceptive when you first see the hotel but rooms are nice and modern, good choice of food and drink, and to be honest the staff really finish it off, always helpful and smiling one of the managers was super nice Diana couldn't do enough to help anybody and always with a big smile, great stay can't wait to return soon.",5,2014,10,21
219,Great Hotel and Restaurant,"Stayed here for 2 nights on bed and breakfast. Rooms were fab, spacious and bed was huge! Breakfast was fantastic, catered for everyone. Our room was very very hot the first night but we spoke to reception who rectified it straight away. We were on the side of the train track but hardly heard the trains. Location was great 5/10 minute walk away from most things and airport bus drops you off round the corner! Would recommend the 30euro freedom of the city pass. We ate in the restaurant on the last night, food was excellent and well worth it. Was a lovely hotel and would certainly return to this hotel.",4,2014,10,20
219,Good hotel and price,"This was a nice hotel and about a mile or so walk to get to the center city. It is just north of the River Liffey and close to Paddy's Palace (great for tours) and about a 15 minute taxi ride to the airport. On arrival, the room was not ready until 2 PM, however, the hotel did store our luggage for free which was a plus. My husband and I went to a pub around the corner (Grainger's) and had lunch and a Guinness. There are many places to eat nearby, which was a plus. Not far from a Starbucks either. The interior is nice and newly redone to more modern furnishings. The rooms are decent-sized with comfy beds and air conditioning. Our room had good wifi connection that worked well. The downside was lack of insulation. You could hear everything outside and in other rooms. This was the biggest downside for me. Also, there are stairs that go from the reception to the elevator so you have to carry your luggage up that. We were able so it wasn't that much of an inconvenience. It was a good hotel overall and a decent price for staying Dublin so close to the sites.",4,2014,10,20
219,A little gem!,"Stayed here with friends for one night to go to a concert in the 3Arena. Excellent choice of hotel.  I stayed in North Star over 10 years ago and .....wow...what a change. I agree with other reviewers, the outside and surrounding area can't be helped but inside the foyer is beautiful, staff were fine (we didn't ask much of them though!) and the food in the bar/restaurant was very good!. The rooms were clean, comfortable, quiet and easy to locate. We looked out onto an apartment block and noise was not an issue. The bathroom, while small was incredibly clean and functional. We didn't have breakfast as there are plenty of places in have brunch in around the corner.  For a city centre hotel, rooms were a decent size and the place was reasonably priced.  It's a great spot to stay in for concerts but don't get taxis from outside. The hotel ran a shuttle bus to the concert. Overall, hotel was a lot better than I expected but I am not fully convinced of its 4* rating.  An excellent 3* would be more accurate. For the best rooms book rooms on 6th and 7th floor. They have balconies. I might stay again for another concert but I prefer the hotels on the south side for a city break!",4,2014,10,19
219,Bad Choice,"We weren't happy from the beginning.  This hotel is in a poor area and we actually had to step over the fresh urine while walking under the railway tracks to get to the hotel.  Our first room looked out onto barbed wire and an alleyway also beneath the tracks.  We asked to move rooms and our second room was smaller, wifi didn't work and the TV was broken.",2,2014,10,18
219,Good break.,"Stayed with my partner for 2 nights. First time in Dublin. Staff friendly and helpful both on check in and any time we needed to speak to them. Room clean and perfectly adequate. Found breakfast to be very good and had one of the best meals I have ever had in mcgettigans. Perhaps a little pricey but I would rather pay more for a nice meal than Pay less for a crap one. Location was good for our needs i.e. Shopping, sightseeing, bars & restaurants. Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to friends and will definitely check availability on further trips to Dunlin. ",5,2014,10,17
219,Lovely Stay,"Me and my partner stayed at the North Star Hotel after searching the internet for a place that was affordable as well as convenient for travel and safe. The North Star ticked all these boxes. Getting around was very easy with the tube only a couple of minutes walk away. This will take you to within walking distance to the Guinness Factory, Dublin Zoo as well as the Cathedral and Viking Museum. We stayed for 3 nights and managed to cram a lot in. I would also recommend going to the Celtic night which includes a three course meal followed by evening entertainment.
Definitely work staying here for a fun packed trip to Dublin.",4,2014,10,17
219,Nice hotel.,"Hotel is nice. The continental breakfast isn't worth the money, you can do better elsewhere. The bar and restaurant is nice if not slightly pricey. The staff was nice and the room was clean. I was surprised that there was two different sized beds when I thought I reserved two of the same size beds. There is an airport ride that runs every two hours but you need to reserve the day before, cost is ‚Ç¨5 and worth it compared to taking the airport bus back for the same price but you have to walk a few blocks to the nearest stop. I did like the members lounge that was mostly empty and useful for next day planning.",4,2014,10,16
219,Basic and very noisy!,"On arriving myself and my boyfriend were slightly reluctant due to the exterior state of the hotel however on entering reception were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful decor and warm welcome of staff. They also offered to hold our luggage until 2pm (check-in time) due to our early arrival. This was a huge relief! After checking in we were giving a family room after only requesting a double, rang reception, room phone was out of service. After explaining the hotel staff quickly changed our room but seemed as if it was a hassle to them. Second room was basic but all we needed however very noisy and we could even hear our neighbour using the loo! And the domestic staff hoovering at 08.30 am!! Not something you would expect! You can definitely see that a lot of money was spend on the reception/bar/communal areas of the hotel and a lot less on the rooms as the double rooms, I found, were not as advertised. Mcgettigans bar was beautiful with friendly staff and good daily deals including  2 for 1 cocktails!",2,2014,10,16
219,2 star at best,"This is a very old hotel that looks ""used"". We had travel for 6 nights in Ireland staying in old hotels that had all been updated successfully. Check in was unhelpful. Due to other reviews on Trip Advisor we asked for a room off the street noise area. Our room was on a busy street. We asked for help to book a tour the next day. They said they could not help but that the concierge would be there in the am. I asked for directions to a self serve launderette. The check in folks had no idea and would not look it up on the computer. There is not a computer at the hotel for guest use. The keys did not work on the first door on our way up to the room. We had to drag our luggage back down stairs to the front desk. Once in the room we discovered the toilet did not flush without trying the handle 4 or 5 times. The next morning there was not a concierge to help book tours. Again the front desk would not help. They directed us to the tourism office. The breakfast was downstairs in a room with no windows. It was lackluster. Box cereal, cartons or yogurt, nothing fixed to order. My husband wanted a croissant. I asked and was told they were out. The next morning when we checked out I asked at the front desk for the managers card. I was told that he could not find one. The desk clerk did not offer the managers name. I have never reviewed on Trip Advisor. This hotel needs serious help training their employees in customer service. I was disappointed since all the other hotels we stayed in while touring Ireland had been as advertised 4 star hotels. ",2,2014,10,16
219,4 stars? NO WAY!,"A 4 star hotel, no minibar. This is the first 4 star hotel I wanted to get out asap, 
The rooms are extremely small and very noisy. The entire hotel is more like a maze.
The music in the breakfast room is loud on bad quality speakers what makes it really annoying.
Never going there again, especially for business.",1,2014,10,16
219,convenient for the city,I had a misgiving or two when we arrived due to its position on a busy street and the closeness of Connelly station but these were quickly forgotten by the warmth of the staff and the internal quality of the hotel. We liked the bar and restaurant and breakfast served in a separate room is good. Many of the rooms are down a corridor under the railway line to a lift which takes you to the breakfast room and also the gym and sauna and of course to your room. It is only when you look out the window that you see the way the hotel has utilised the space. 15 minute walk to O'Connell St and over the Liffey to Temple Bar which is everything you expect it to be,5,2014,10,15
219,Very lovely hotel and a world away from the outside,"Booked this hotel for our weekend stay to see ed sheeran in concert. Hotel was awesome, lovely welcome, facilities, restaurant and nice decorated rooms. Location was good for all sight seeing places. Just not in the most beautiful part of town but don't let that put you off",5,2014,10,14
219,Our perfect Irish adventure!!,"Having never been to Diblin before it was difficult to know which location/hotel to choose - many say they're in a great location only to find that when you arrive you're miles out (which we have experienced several times in cities before). However, we were extremely happy with the location of North Star and what a gorgeous hotel to stay at. Beautifully decorated and such friendly service. I had read reviews of rooms being noisy due to it's close proximity to the train line so I emailed prior to our stay to request a room away from any possible noise. They were extremely accommodating and went above and beyond my expectations, making our stay even more pleasurable. Thank you!!",4,2014,10,14
219,Terrible,"Myself and my partner both work near by and after some coaxing from me he eventually agreed to try the new Mcgettigans bar in the North Star. 
While the decor and staff are well presented and staff are friendly the food was a major let down. 
I had chicken wings for starter but for some reason the bones had fragmented through the meat on them leading to me nearly bringing a tooth, very unpleasant. My boyfriend had goats cheese filo wraps which tasted good maybe a little too greasy. 
We both got the steak and mash, I asked for mine medium rare and my boyfriends steak medium, they both came out like leather.....I gave up eating half way through as it was just too tough! We opted out of dessert as everything else was just too unpleasant! 
Will not be back, which is a shame because it's a great location, pleasant decor and nice staff....chef is letting this place down  
",1,2014,10,13
219,Great Location,"Love this hotel, great location, great food, perfect for shopping and concerts.  I asked to be bumped up to the executive rooms and was at no extra cost.  We were also given access to the executive lounge which has great views over Dublin and for smokers the lounge has two smoking balconies.",5,2014,10,13
219,Tour hotel. ,Arrived with my tour and had no room. Fortunately 1 couple left our group the day before and was given their room. No problem at all. The room was clean and had a balcony.  The restaurant for breakfast was less than okay. Had to hunt down a wait staff for coffee and it seemed that our group was ignored by staff. It was the last day of an 8 day tour so we were all tired and aware of the GREAT service we had received at our other hotels.,3,2014,10,12
219,"Warm, comfortable ambience and friendly, professional staff","The North Star was our anchor hotel for our three city, seven day, tour of Ireland. Our first day in Ireland was 4 Oct. Dublin was fantastic, thanks to recommendations on where to dine and find great traditional music.  We returned to the North Star on 9 Oct. and enjoyed a wonderful dinner in the hotel's restaurant after strolling through the downtown area, the ladies even getting haircuts on Talbot Street. 
We will recommend the North Star to all our friends and definitely plan to stay there when we return to Dublin.",5,2014,10,11
219,Four days in Ireland,"We only had four days in Ireland, very happy we chose this hotel! We arrived a little early taking the Paddywagon and our room was almost available so we spoke with consierge while we waited, he was very knowledgable and helpful. Our wait for our room wasnt very long, we checked in, walked up a few stairs to the elevator takng it to the seventh floor room 760. It was perfect! Very clean, comfy bed, little fridge, inroom safe, hair dryer. This floor has access to the lounge where you have bottled water, coffee, tea, cookies. In the morning they offer yogert, cereal as well. This hotel is walking distance from the city. Lots of stores and restarants nearby. Yes, it is near the train station but the sound was no problem,I slept very well. The food in the restarant was very good too! I would love to stay here again.",5,2014,10,11
219,Surprised,My wife and I stayed here for 1 night. Checked in on sunday afternoon. Pleasantly surprised. Hotel was bustling with people checking in for a concert nearby in the 3 arena. That's the reason also we checked in. Reception very attentive. Offered to get our bags brought to our room if needed. We dropped everything in the room and went to the bar for dinner. Fantastic is the best way to describe it. Room was clean and cosy. Only downside to entire stay was the shower. No water pressure so it was a poor experience. The following morning the odour of stale stagnant water in the bathroom ftom the drains was evident but quickly cleared. Left comment card in room filled out. Rm168. No other issues. Highly recommed for a stay and idealy located for the 3 arena. Will definitely stay there again. ,4,2014,10,11
219,too noisy!,"we stayed in this hotel for 2 nights & the noise is horrible!  the front of the hotel faces a very busy street, the middle of the hotel has the train running right through it and the back of the hotel is again on a less busy street but constant traffic.  it was miserable but the staff is great!  I had them bring me xtra duvets to use on top of my bed as the beds are hard.  rooms are clean & small.  breakfast is ok but it might be that I am tired of the Irish breakfast.  location is very good for buses & the tram  easy walking distance to the main city center",2,2014,10,10
219,Just OK,"We stayed here 2 nights via the Groupon. First night standard room back of hotel. Staff very friendly and room was clean. However, standard room was very small and bathroom tub old and difficult to get in/out of. 2nd night we paid for upgrade to one of their nicest rooms and the room was beautiful with a great view, however again bathroom was way too small and old small tub (cracked caulking). The reason for only 3 stars is due to the above, it's very close to train noise and the location is north of city center",3,2014,10,09
219,"Short but excellent stay, would come back with pleasure!","First, i have to say i'm sorry for having waited so long to write a review about your hotel. We've been checking in here after special circumstances. That was the final night of our trip and the previous stay was terrible. It doesn't bother me to sleep in little comfort and questionable rooms as i am an luxury hotels professional and is keeps me away from work :-) But my girlfriend had a terrible night and was really excited and happy about the room. We've obviously been upgraded as the staff gave us the W.B Yeats suite which was large, extremely clean and comfortable for our standards.
 So thanks to them to allow my girlfriend being able to rest and enjoy our last night in Ireland before flying back to Paris. If back in Dublin we'll for sure book the same room in the same hotel. Location is great, at walking distance (for Parisians) from the main highlights. Breakfast ok, other amenities all right. Thanks to the staff and hopefully we'll be back here!",5,2014,10,08
219,Perfect for what we needed.,"Stayed here for a long weekend and we found it to be a great hotel. 
The quality of the hotel was fantastic, very clean and very classy. When we arrived we got a free upgrade to the premier suites, no reason other than they had some spare, so that was a welcomed surprise! The room was spacious, clean and modern, the bed was huge and comfy and there's a free safety deposit box - can't have any complaints with the room whatsoever. With the upgrade we also got access to a club lounge which has free biscuits, hot drinks and bottled water, again another nice surprise.
The quality of breakfast was fantastic, all hot and fresh and all the usual stuff; sausages, bacon, beans, as well as cheeses and fruits. The bar was very nice, well priced and good choice of beers and cocktails. The bar staff were friendly, as were the rest of the staff within the hotel.

The location was also good, approximately a fifteen minute walk to temple bar and that's at a leisurely stroll. Most things are in a reasonable walking distance, however if you don't fancy walking - there are always plenty of taxis just outside the hotel. The Zoo is one of the furthest things away and that cost us about 12 euros. A taxi to the airport from just outside the hotel cost us 19.50 euros.

Overall a very nice hotel and would definitely recommend.",5,2014,10,07
219,Vintage Hotel,"Vintage hotel in a relatively convenient location. Comfortable rooms, professional staff. Highly recommend the breakfast. Especially enjoyed the big city environment with trains, taxi's  and busses nearby. A 10 minute walk puts you at town center where on-off bus tours are available.",4,2014,10,07
219,north star hotel dublin,Great spot great hotel its in a great location lovely staff . Room was good standard very clean n tidy. Would recommend it to anyone needing a hotel in dublin. Close to all the main areas of dublin great stay.,5,2014,10,07
219,Excellent customer service.,"We arrived very early before. 2:00 checkin. Front desk went way beond to get us into a room within 10 mins of our arrival,after travelling non stop from Texas. Rooms were great, great location to pubs and transportation. Beds and shower were better than most . Would return",5,2014,10,07
219,A hidden gem,"I heard ""mixed"" stories about this hotel, it certainly seems to have had a bad reputation historically.

Now, it is very comfortable, with good clean spacious rooms.  I heard no noise from trains or the road from my room.

It is maybe a little off the track for central Dublin, but it's only a Luas / short taxi ride away.",5,2014,10,07
219,Great stay,We stayed her for a concert very convenient for that got a free upgrade over a minor issue the receptionist was very helpful and very apologetic rooms superb beds comfortable and very clean will deffo be back,5,2014,10,05
219,Convenient Location,"My wife and I found the hotel a good stepping off point for touring the city of Dublin. We walked to most major sites. The Tram (Luas) station is directly across the street, should you be so inclined to use public transportation. The Connolly train station is also across the street and the bus station is a short walk. The hotel staff was very accommodating. Our room was small but adequate and the breakfast was excellent with numerous choices. Some people complained about the noise (train station is across the street) but our room was quiet since it was located in the back. Note check-in is 2pm but If you arrive early, they will secure your bags. Calling ahead for early check-in would be advisable. The hotel does offer an airport shuttle, for a fee, but we found the Air Link 747 bus to be more convenient (leaves to & from the airport every 15 minutes).",4,2014,10,02
219,Brilliant 70th birthday break...,"I decided to take my mum to Dublin for a long weekend for her 70th birthday. We went will our friends and arrived at the hotel at about 10pm. Everything was ready for us and allsorted out. My mum has severe MS, and we was allocated two rooms opposite each other with all disabled facilities, which made our stay pleasurable. The hotel staff where so polite and friendly and couldn't do enough for us. They brought my mum a bottle of wine with 4 glass to celebrate, and a lovely letter from the Manager wishing her a happy birthday. We had breakfast in the hotel every morning as the food was gorgeous, hot and fresh at all times. Staff constantly asking if everything was ok and did we need anything else. I would certainatley recommend this hotel, and will be revisiting again.",5,2014,10,01
219,Wouldnt come here ever again,"I stayed here with my partner to celebrate our anniversary and to experience Dublin for 3 nights. Initially we were very unhappy with the hotel. We paid nearly ¬£400 for 3 nights and our room was so basic and ugly I was gobsmacked. We were on lower floor next to a noisey road. Immediately I complained and was upgraded to the premier sutie room. This room was amazing and exactly the same as the photos online, however I still wouldn't pay so much for so little! The lady at reception was lovely. The restaurant food was delicious but again so overpriced, we only ate there once. However if money is no issue, I would definitely recommend the sea bass/bream ( cant remember specifics) it was the best fish ever eaten but still too costly. Beware they lock the doors at night which was annoying as we were stuck outside for 10 minutes trying to get in, whilst being pestered by a very violent drunk. The location is perfect for the train station but not so good if your visiting for night life! Around 25 minute walk to Temple Bar, which is a lot if your in heels or pee a lot when you've been drinking! The taxis are rip off. cost us 35 euro to get to hotel from airpport. The reception lady said if we book through the hotel for a taxi it would be no more than 19 euros. which was perfect as by the end of our trip we were skint. Bars are ridiculous price. the taxi actually cost us 30 euros so we weren't happy with the information we were given. Overall it was ok, but save your money and find somewhere with better location, that is cheaper, and has its own entertainment.",2,2014,09,30
219,ok but wouldnt visit again,"I stayed here with my partner to celebrate our anniversary and to experience Dublin for 3 nights. Initially we were very unhappy with the hotel. We paid nearly ¬£400 for 3 nights and our room was so basic and ugly I was gobsmacked. We were on lower floor next to a noisey road. Immediately I complained and was upgraded to the premier sutie room. This room was amazing and exactly the same as the photos online, however I still wouldn't pay so much for so little! The lady at reception was lovely. The restaurant food was delicious but again so overpriced, we only ate there once. However if money is no issue, I would definitely recommend the sea bass/bream ( cant remember specifics) it was the best fish ever eaten but still too costly. Beware they lock the doors at night which was annoying as we were stuck outside for 10 minutes trying to get in, whilst being pestered by a very violent drunk which made me feel very uneasy and ruined the evening. The location is perfect for the train station but not so good if your visiting for night life and has a slight dodgey feel about it!

219,Practical Choice,"Very easy to get to from the airport. The Air Link stops about a block away, and for the return, the pick up point is only a couple blocks away. Probably had the friendliest staff of the three hotels we used on this trip to Ireland. Always trying to be helpful, with a smile. While not right in the heart of a tourist‚Äôs focus, it is only a short walk away, plus Connelly Station and the Tram were across the street. Breakfasts were included in our plan, and they were very good. Breakfast room is very pleasant, well organized, and the service was congenial and prompt. For convenience, the attached restaurant, McGettigan‚Äôs Cookhouse, was very good, but that‚Äôs for another review.
Our room was comfortable, and clean. This older hotel has received timely, effective maintenance to keep it in good condition. The only drawback we experienced was for rooms on the north side of the building, the street noise could be loud fairly long into the night. It was noticed by a light sleeper, but not by the other.",4,2014,09,29
219,Awful check out but amazing hotel,"We booked 2 nights at this hotel. The check-in was smooth and the guy was a pleasure to deal with, absolute hassle free. The room was 553, worth the money, very clean and the king-size bed was very comfortable. 

We need a clean room, a comfy bed and a decent shower when we travel thats it.

Everything was very cool until we went to pay for our room. The lady from reception had an attitutide with me, mocking me and she talked like I was a doormat. I kept it professional but when she said that my credit card was declined( she tried 5 times) i said I will pay by debit card. After i called my credit card company, they told me that they declined the payments as the hotel pre-authorised my card upon my arrival which I knew and the transaction was suspicious. I went to desk and said that I dont have time and She need to refund the money that she took from my debit card, she started to play the victim role and all I wanted is to pay for my room and to go the airport. I start to be frustrated because I really dislike emotional people and I became emotional when I realised that I will lose my plan if I stay a minute more. This is my fault as I should pay in the evening when we have arrived. 

A manager came along but I needed to go in that moment and she was smiling like this is nothing. Maybe for the manager was nothing but for myself that moment was very important. Until now I don't know if the money are refunded but I will suggest to pay either by cash or upon your arrival to have your check-out hassle free.

We will visit again if the hotel will refund our money and we will have them word that we wont experience what we have experienced in the morning we checked out.

219,Good but not great,"The hotel is nice and in good condition. If you are travelling by train, it is probably convenient, but we drove into Dublin and walked or took the tram (Laos) during our stay. The hotel itself is nice and so is the staff and restaurant. The parking on site is a plus at 12 Euro per day. Beds are comfortable and the room was spacious enough.

Some things to consider is that the lift is on the second floor so you do have to take some stairs to access any room. Our room was in a quiet location though - we did not hear any trains or street noise at all. This may actually be the advantage of the maze design.

The main downside of this hotel is the location. If you are a tourist in Dublin, almost everything you want to visit is on the other side of the river. So, you spend a lot of time walking (of course you could take a taxi). While we were fine with walking, the streets near the hotel are lined with transients and intoxicated people and are not clean at all.  It is not a pleasant walk after the shops are closed.  I will add that this is true for the Temple Bar area also, so it depends on what you are comfortable with.

Dublin is a city and a great city. But, the next time I visit, I would stay closer to the cathedral or judicial area.",4,2014,09,28
219,James Taylor concert,"Great hotel location we where going to Dublin by train from Portadown and the train station is just across the road. They upgrade us to a suite as it was my hubby's birthday present and it was lovely two tv's a small balcony nice decor. We travelled to the 3 arena by team which we got just around the corner and it left us to the door of the arena and back again which was great. We did eat in the hotel and the food was good they have specials on every day. When we came back from the concert we availed of the cocktail menu which had great choices. When we got up the next day we went down for breakfast which was a buffet and there was lots of choices for every taste ,we had the hot breakfast and some cereal to start with (the bacon was delicious) everything was lovely and hot and the staff where very helpful. I would use this hotel again and would certainly recommend it. Location great for shopping and concerts. We had chocolates and a lovely letter in our room wishing my husband a Happy  Birthday which wad a lovely touch .",4,2014,09,27
219,"Convenient, roomy but noisy.","Room 657 Large, good views over railway, small balcony. Everything you need, including friendly staff, great food in bar/bistro. Loved the goats cheese spring rolls, prawns wrapped in carpaccio , hamburgers, sounds plain but yummy. 

Big drawback drunk and swearing noisy neighbours from 1.30 to 4.30 am, very noisy creaking bedroom floor and doors that slam when shutting. This is an issue as in Dublin people are coming back from night events or leaving early for airport or ferry. Also no tissues and only liquid soap dispenser. For the price they charge this is ridiculous. But they do have a safe, iron and good bed.",3,2014,09,27
219,"""Premier"" is a gross mis-representation of this hotel","The hotel is modest by any measure.  It is definitely over stated in its title!  The local trolley train runs over the top of the building and just outside my room every 30 min from 730 in the morning till late at night.  It's a block from the local bus station so there are lots of transients in the area. 

You have to tote your luggage up two half flights of stairs to get to the elevator.   They did offer help, however.  The breakfast buffet is good, the rooms are clean, and the staff is pleasant.",2,2014,09,27
219,"""Real Average""","We got to the hotel after dark and had difficulty finding the parking area because it was so dark in front of that side of the hotel.  We checked in after parking two blocks away and decided to get some dinner at the hotel restaurant .  Dinner was fine, while waiting for it to be prepared I decided to find the parking area, it was right in front of the hotel but there was really no entrance to the hotel for a vehicle, just an alley to pull into.  The parking guy got me squared away and I went back to dinner.  After dinner I asked the young lady at the front desk if maybe the shouldn't have some type of lit sign for parking and she told me that I should have gotten details from my travel company about the parking arrangements.  I found this to be kind of rude but I was too tired to argue.  Room was average at best, it was clean, and quite noisy in the halls and outside.  We went out exploring on our second day because I didn't feel comfortable at night around the neighborhood.  We walked to The Temple Bar area where we had a great time, we made sure to walk back to the hotel during daylight so we could feel safe in the area.  One of the young ladies working in the middle reception area had given us great tips on The Temple Bar area.  As far as the hotel was concerned, it was clean, had a nice restaurant but hey need to brighten things up on the outside so you can find the parking area at night.  Overall it was OK .",3,2014,09,27
219,Excellent crossroad place in Dublin,"This hotel is really the best place in Dublin, close to a main station O'connoly station, close to the shopping areas (Talbot Street), close to plenty of restaurants and close to the main places to visit in Dublin. Rooms are excellent, very clean. Reception is extremely helpful and they are speaking several languages. Internet is working very well in your rooms and everywhere in the hotel. The TV is quite old. Just close your eyes and book it, no regret at all.",5,2014,09,27
219,Overall good - several flights of stairs to the elevators,"Excellent breakfast
Beds were comfortable 
Had to take staircase to get to the elevators/lifts to the rooms
Neighborhood was a little iffy.  Twice we were overran with teens on bikes, so much that the corner kiosk rolled down their door when the kids showed up.   
Easy access th the airport bus stop.",4,2014,09,27
219,"Good hotel, comfortable room","Stayed only for one night. The room was clean, beautiful and comfortable. It was on the second floor and there was no elevator to this part of the hotel.
There is some train noise that didn‚Äôt bother us.

Breakfast was served in a very nice dinning room, was full and good.

There is a 20 minutes walk to the center of Dublin, mostly on Talbot street, which has many shops as well, makes the walk longer‚Ä¶ :-)",4,2014,09,26
219,Comfortable with good service,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights and we booked through an external site so we didn't have a choice of room. On arrival we found we had a huge room to ourselves, three beds! It looked onto a back street on the far end so thankfully we didn't have any of the noise or disturbance that other guests have mentioned, i'm not surprised there are issues as you can see the train line running pretty much across the corner of the hotel. The decor and furniture in the room was old fashioned, nothing like in the photos and the bathroom was out of the 70's but cleanliness and maintenance were good so no complaints. We both slept really well during our stay. Service was great, at reception and also in McGettigans Bar and Restaurant and the food was faultless.  

Free Wi-fi. It was a bit unreliable but we weren't reliant on it and if it's free you can't really complain can you!

We walked in and out of the city centre to the Guinness Storehouse and Temple Bar, a fair trek but very easy with the city tourist map and took the Dart up to Howth Head to see the beauty of the coastline. Only 20minutes away and the station is right across the road. I had mentioned our sightseeing plans to the barman when we arrived on the Monday night and ten minutes later he re-appeared with the maps we'd need and details of coastal trips! That was typical of the kind of service we received from everyone. Helpful and friendly.

We had a really enjoyable stay and would be more than happy to come back to this hotel in the future.",4,2014,09,26
219,"Ask for a room away from the trains,  and you'll love it","The hotel is right across from Connelly (not sure of spelling)  train station so it's imperative that you get a room on the other side. It seemed that the even numbered rooms are the quiet ones.. We moved from 359 right across the hall to 360 and it made all the difference. We arrived at about 6am and they let us rest in the guest lounge... A quiet room with comfy chairs and couches.  I actually got a few hours sleep in there.. And they very kindly brought us toast and tea while we waited for our room to be ready. The rooms are comfortable and clean, but a little on the small side. You can walk to Trinity College and the Temple Bar area in about 15-20 minutes.  To get to the Heuston Train station  you can catch the above ground tram right across the street. The hotel has a shuttle bus to the airport for 5 euros.  This hotel is fine as a home base for sight - seeing... Not as a romantic get-away.",4,2014,09,25
219,Wonderful Hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"We found the North Star to be simply fabulous accommodation. The atmosphere is homely&friendly and every member of staff we met and spoke to where extremely nice, professional and helpful in every way. An added bonus was the food in McGettigans in house restaurant was outstanding! Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,22
219,Nice hotel shame about the noise,Booked a 2 night break in Dublin to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  Our travel agent had asked if there was a chance of a nice room higher up with a view as it was a special occasion. Unfortunately this wasn't the case and we were allocated room 210 which although clean and well equipped was located just above an extremely noisy ventilation unit.  Added to this was its close proximity to the busy railway line with trains running from before 6am to after 11pm.  The room was also extremely warm as were the corridors outside and this necessitated the window being left open as there was no air conditioning.  Having said that we had no option but to shut the window in the night as the noise from the ventilation unit was so loud that it was impossible to sleep through it.  On the plus side the buffet breakfast was excellent and good quality and the hotel staff friendly and helpful.  If the stay had been longer we would certainly have asked to be relocated and I would add that when booking in we did not get offered the opportunity to upgrade.  It was just such a shame that a special request was disregarded and we probably ended up with one of the worst located rooms in the hotel on what was a special occasion.,3,2014,09,18
219,enjoyable city break,"this was a long planned city break for me, so I was lucky to get a stansars double room (sole use) at the early booker's rate (highly recommended). the room was spacious enough for me, not too sure I would have felt the same way if I actually had shared the room. room well equipped, though (lovely bathroom with tub). room was situated on the ground floor (street level) facing a side street, passersby and lack of daylight seemed an issue, but weren't in the end - enough artificial light and had a good night's sleep even with windows open. there is an upgrade option (from ‚Ç¨30) which may be worth to be considered for longer stays. location of the hotel absolutely top (~7 min to O'Connell by foot), make use of the shuttle service (cheaper and more comfortable)!!! staff was welcoming and more than friendly. good and comprehensive breakfast buffet, was even refilled within its last 15 mins for the later birds.",4,2014,09,18
219,"Helpful staff, great rooms, felt safe...would stay here again","The North Star Hotel was our first and last place to stay in Ireland. We had a wonderful experience here and I loved the quirky decor. We arrived very early in the morning on our first day, and the staff securely stored our luggage for us, and gave my husband a map of the city, circled sites of interest, and marked the easiest route to get to the from the hotel. We used that map so much it was falling apart by the time we left. Our rooms were very comfortable, clean, noise was not an issue, and everything in working order. The last night we stayed, we were upgraded to a suite on the 7th floor with amazing views, a little balcony, and a much larger room.
The hotel is away from the city center, but across the street from Connolly Station, and has great proximity to the LUAS station, which we used to navigate to the city center. The last night we had left our adapter at our previous hotel in Galway, and they had an extra one at the desk they let me use during the remainder of our stay. Had no issues with ""brown water"", I even drank water from the tap and it was fine. They even have a shuttle that runs to the airport very early in the morning so we did not have to find our own way there. All in all, great hotel, well staffed with friendly and helpful people, and would definitely stay again.",5,2014,09,17
219,Lovely  friendly staff and great place,This is the second  time I stay here and have to say I love the update they made and staff is great and great to city centre and breakfast  was great the only down side to it is at night the area come little scary i wouldn't let my wife walk there by her self  but would stay again ,5,2014,09,17
219,Birthday Trip,"Traveled to Dublin with my mom and best friend for our birthdays.  We got a triple, basic room, with three twin beds - no perks; it served its purpose nicely. Some minor setbacks in the poor ventilation in the bathroom (3 women/3 consecutive showers caused the fire alarm to go off), and the air conditioner rattled loudly when it was on.  Luckily, keeping the window slightly open all the time kept the room cool enough.  

 Overall the room was good, the restaurant attached to the hotel - McGettigan's - was amazing, the people were very friendly.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,09,17
219,Watch out for the brown water,Staff are lovely and very welcoming. The hotel is clean and modern but whilst cleaning our teeth the water came out brown as mud. Again whilst showering the water was brown.   When we informed the staff they just said sorry?!?!?,1,2014,09,17
219,Lovely hotel in handy location,"Dublin hotel rooms that can accommodate a family of four are hard to find, so we were pleased to find such a nice one. Done in a contemporary decor, our room was clean and comfortable, with lots of hot water and a well-flushing toilet.  Located at the back of the hotel it faced on a fairly quiet back street. The hotel set-up is a bit odd, as you have to climb several steps up from the lobby and walk down a long hall and through a set of locked doors to get to the elevator - not easy for anyone with mobility issues, though the bellhop was helpful with our heavy luggage. The location was great - steps from O'Connell street's tourist buses and Talbot street shops, about 15 min from Temple Bar to the west and Trinity College to the south. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Restaurant was ok.  Breakfast buffet had an adequate selection and the price was competitive with other offerings in the neighbourhood (we found it a better bet than the local coffee shops). Airport shuttle stops at the door and costs only 5 euros - about 20 minutes drive.  Solid, enjoyable stay - recommended.",4,2014,09,16
219,"Spotless, comfy and welcoming...",Myself and partner stayed here for 2 nights as we were going to a show in the O2 and wanted to make a weekend of it.  We really enjoyed our stay even though room was quite small and basic it was spotless and very comfy bed. I arrived before check in on the friday and there was a room ready which was great. I went of shopping for the day as hotel is close to everything and right across from connolly station.  We ate in hotel both nights as we loved the atmosphere and service in the bar and food was very nice. Staff are very attentive but not in your face which is great. The twe free glasses of processco with a la carte was a lovely touch and i really enjoyed it.  Breskfast was fresh and plentifull although breakfast room was a bit warm and stuffy.  All on all it was one of our most enjoyable hotel breaks weve had and already thinking about going to stay over christmas even though we live close to dublin city. :) ,5,2014,09,16
219,Ok for a quick stay ,"My partner and I stayed here for 1 night whilst on a quick tour of Dublin. we got an extremely good price for the hotel on travel republic (¬£65 for bed and breakfast) so expectations weren't that high. The hotel itself and public areas are lovely very modern and decorated tastefully, as is the restaurant. However our room on the first floor was not modern and not a reflection on the pictures shown online. I'm guessing this is as a
Result of the price paid. It was however clean and suitable for a night. The real issue came with the room service, I was unwell and so just wanted dinner in the room after a long day and the room service menu was extremely limited, about 4 options. They did serve pizza after 9 o'clock and it was about 8.15 so I rang to ask if they could make us one a little early, they couldn't so I rang back at 9 o clock and ordered one along with some drinks. They mentioned nothing about a wait so at 9.50 I rang back to chase it as it still hadn't arrived. The lady on reception said they had attempted to deliver it and would send it back up, this came as a surprise as we were reading quietly and heard nothing no knock at all. When the drinks and pizza arrived at 10.05 it was piping hot so I found it difficult to believe it had already been brought up. It was quite tasty and reasonably priced so if reception had told us it was busy we wouldn't have minded waiting and would have gone to the bar up get the drinks ourselves. 

Overall a nicely presented hotel a good 15 min walk from the centre but perfectly located off the 747 airport bus and very reasonably priced.",3,2014,09,14
219,Good location,"It was good location for city centre just a few minutes walk from O Connell Street , nice hotel but not great for kids, we had our 1 year old with us and found it awkward with the buggy as theres 2 sets of steep steps before you get to a lift. Other than that cant complain just wouldnt return with children.",4,2014,09,13
219,Had a wonderful stay,"We were here for the Penn State vs. University of Central Florida game. The hotel is very close to all main attractions and the Temple Bar area. We arrived before our room was ready, but we were able to leave our luggage with the hotel until we could check in.  We were within walking distance to everything. Our rooms were very spacious and clean.  Breakfast and wifi were included in our room rate. We had a wonderful visit and everyone was very friendly and helpful.  I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",4,2014,09,13
219,Location,"This hotel is in a great location across from the central train staion.  Even though I arrived in a late Friday evening it was a convenient location.  It is easy to reach and central to the transportation hub, trains buses and taxis. Quick reach by bus from airport. I walked a few blocks with a rolling suitcase from the bus stop and passed an active night scene with plenty of restaurant/pubs open at 11:30pm. The staff was helpful and very accommodating.",5,2014,09,13
219,Great value and wonderful staff,"My mother and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights.  Very close (within walking distance) to all the main attractions.  Rooms were a good size and very clean.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Arrived very early, but was able to check into our room by 1pm.  Very good transport system around the hotel.  Would recommend and certainly stay there again.",5,2014,09,11
219,Great value for money. Main attractions within easy reach.,"The hotel is easy to get to from Dublin Airport via the Airlink bus service which leaves the Airport about every 15-20 minutes. The stop is directly opposite the Airport Arrivals building. We arrived at the hotel at about 11.00 well ahead of the scheduled check in, but as our room was ready we were able to check in early which was great. Our flight home was in the evening and on our last day we were able to leave our bags at the hotel after we'd checked out & collect them later when we needed to go to the Airport.  My friend & I shared a twin room which was very spacious, nicely presented & very clean. The room was situated at the front of the hotel above the bar. The music from the bar was a little loud, we rang reception to mention this & the volume was turned down. Breakfast was included in our room price & was very good. There was a good variety to choose from e.g. cooked Irish, continental, cereals fruit etc. Staff were very friendly & helpful. The hotel is well situated with many of the main attractions within about 15 - 20 minutes walkng distance. There are also good transport links for those who prefer not to walk. I was very impressed with the hotel. I felt it was very good value for money. I would certainly stay there again & would definitely recommend it to friends.",4,2014,09,10
219,Very nice stay,Booked for 2 nights and was very satisfied the rooms were a good size and very clean. I was also welcomed at reception upon arrival. I would reconmend this hotel and would stay here again the location is very close to the temple bar (walking distance) with good pubs and resturants. ,4,2014,09,10
219,Pleasant hotel,"This hotel was part of our tour group for one night.  Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  We were concerned about sleep with the nearby train tracks, however, we had no problem sleeping with the window closed.  From inside our room, we could hear foot traffic in the narrow hallway.  The two elevators are small - holding only 4 people with luggage.  After checking in, we found using the stairs much easier and faster.  The buffet style breakfast was very good with a large selection of items.  We found the staff to be pleasant.",4,2014,09,09
219,affordable and central,"The hotel is affordable and easy to reach with the bus from the airport. It's central to train and bus stations. Short ways to the sights. The free WiFi was great.
Breakfast was a little too expensive for our taste, but good alternatives are in the surrounding areas.",4,2014,09,08
219,Holidays 1-5sept,"Hotel was good, near the train station,even though DUB is more fo a walking city.
Breakfast was good, staff was very nice. Cleanliness was top, staff was very carefull with this point.
It has a Spar market just at the corner that is open 24h (not sure here, but i went there at midnight).
In general its a good hotel to spend a couple of days in.",4,2014,09,08
219,Convenient location - basic room,"My boyfriend and I spent 8 nights at the North Star Hotel in August/Sept 2014. Overall, the stay was comfortable although we spent most days out and really only returned to turn in and sleep. 

First, the pros: the location next to the Connolly Station in Dublin is fantastic (access to train, Luas, and buses). It was also within walking distance to many locations. Another pro was free WiFi. While it was not stellar speeds, it got the job done (surfing websites, checking emails, no streaming). 

Now for the cons: the room we had was very basic. Far from the pictures that are posted. The bathroom was a bit odd - the tub/shower was raised which meant that each time I took a shower, I had to carefully hang on to the door/handles to get in/out. Plus, the water temperature went from tepid to scalding hot. There was no cold/warm water. Some of the fixtures were loose, and the toiletries (shampoo/conditioner/wash gel) had an odd smell. 

All in all, it wasn't luxury experience, but then again, I wasn't really expecting that.",3,2014,09,08
219,Fantastic place to stay!,"Great location! We were able to walk to several shopping areas and the pub at the hotel was one of our favorites during our entire stay in Ireland. Rooms were clean and they did everything to accommodate us, even an early check-in.",5,2014,09,08
219,"Nice room and location, avg value for price","We stayed here in August 2014. Location good for us, away from downtown noise but close enough to get there in a short walk. Public areas are somewhat worn but the room was nice. Small improvements would be meaningful such as screens on windows, proper shampoo and soap dispensers, and USB ports for charging.  Staff was very nice though checkout was somewhat challenging because of billing errors. I would stay here again unless I find similar accommodations for a better price, I think the cost was a bit high.",3,2014,09,07
219,Not quite as advertised,"This was rated as a four-star hotel, and the pictures seemed to indicate that.  The first room that we checked into was very basic, plus the electric kept turning off (using your key to activate).  I can say that they were responsive to our complaint and shifted us to another room.  It still was basic and when we turned on the a/c, the fan was incredibly noisy.  Again, they were responsive, finally putting us in a ""suite"", which certainly wasn't 4-star, but was adequate, and really designed as a ""handicapped"" accommodation.  Thus, while I compliment the staff for trying to please, the property just isn't as advertised.  It is relatively convenient to the ""On-Off"" bus system, but that was over 1/2 mile away.  For the rate we paid, this certainly wasn't a bargain.",3,2014,09,07
219,Overall comfortable,"The staff were great and we felt welcome and cared after.  The first room we were in however, they just couldn't get the wifi to work.  Also the bathroom drain would not drain, so after trying to deal with the wifi issue (which we needed in order to communicate with our fellow travelers etc) I figured I would just drop the trap and have a check myself.  Turned out someone used the bathroom sink as an ashtray for about ten smokes and just stuffed the butts down the drain.  Not the hotels fault for that, but housekeeping should be checking these things when they clean the room (i.e. trash cans empty, sinks and shower are draining, toilet flushes etc).  
The staff were great about upgrading us to a nicer room (without us asking, they just offered because of the wifi issue).  In the USA you would have had to screamed and fought for something like that.  The only reason this has a 3 instead of a 4 is that the value for the basic room is just out of line for the area.  A room without AC, clogged sink, no functioning wifi, one bed, and a hell of a hike through halls and up and down stairs (like a maze) was inline with any of the many hostels in the area for less than half the price.",3,2014,09,07
219,First night in Dublin,"Looks so much better on the inside. Wish rooms were available early morning, but certainly understand. Concierge gave us great advice as to what to do until rooms were ready.  Are staying three more nights there on this trip. ",5,2014,09,07
219,a warm welcome,"only called in for a drink and a bite to eat and yet again the staff and the food did not disappoint, a pleasant pub/hotel where you are guaranteed a warm welcome , the back room under the railway arches is a novel idea for those who want a comfortable  area without  the stuffyness that can sometimes occur when a venue is packed",5,2014,09,06
219,Staten Islanders trip to Ireland,"1 week in Ireland and our last stop was the North Star Hotel.  When we booked I didn't hear good things, but when we arrived early and were given our rooms right away. The rooms were nice and clean.  The lobby was spacious and a great place to sit and talk with some wine beer and/or tea. 
If you have a high floor room its a walk up the stairs to the elevator.  Not many bellhops to help with Luggage.
The Restaurant was very good and they had an outside beer Garden area which was nice to sit and have dessert and drinks after Dinner.
All and all a nice place to stay",4,2014,09,06
219,"Good bedding, great 2 bdr apartments, excellent breakfast","Stayed at NorthStarPremier on our landing day in IRL before touring the country. Checkin at 2am, staff was welcoming and helping. Swiftly moved into our Conolly Suite, 2 bedrooms... perfect for family. Very quiet and we had a wonderful sleep. Price tag was rather high side (220eur night, excl bkfast) but it was peak season in early august. Excellent irish breakfast served until 10am and ready to explore the city at 10-15mins walking distance. Easy walk indeed. The vicinity of rail tracks may raise some concerns about noise at night/dawn so check which side of the hotel you are being given.",4,2014,09,06
219,Loud,"Have stayed few times here, last time I stayed which was a couple of weeks ago I was put in one of the newly refurnished rooms, it was beautiful, nicely decorated. When I got to my room at 6pm there was very loud music coming from somewhere,  I thought it was coming from the reception area so took no notice. At 10pm when I went back to my room the music was still very loud , twisted and turned till midnight when I got up and crept down the corridor stopping at each room to see where it was coming from. I finally realised it was coming from the room above me, rang reception and they finally put a stop to it. What I can't understand is why nobody else reported it, it was blaring from at least 6pm. Went back to bed only now to be kept awake from whatever the hell they were now up to...think I finally dozed off about 4am.. Beautiful hotel but must say I did not enjoy my last visit at all.",3,2014,09,05
219,Fab hotel and central location,"Me and my husband stayed there for sightseeing purposes. It was a very central hotel and only a couple of streets away from the Main Street O'Connell Street. However, it is right next to the train station but I can't say I ever noticed the noise. 

We were upgraded for free and had a fab, clean room and free cocktails. I can't fault the hotel but the only thing I will say is that I wouldn't recommend it for wheelchair users as there is only a staircase up to the rooms. Also, check out the beer garden under the arches - with outdoor heaters and fairy lights! Very snug! ",5,2014,09,04
219,"Nice hotel and staff, noisy room and poor breakfast","Stayed for one night with my Mum on Sept 1st. I emailed Diana the manager in advance requesting a quiet room as we had a busy couple of days in Dublin. She said they would do their very best to accommodate our request.
When we checked in it was lovely to be checked in by Diana, who was very friendly, and she even remembered me from my email, recognising my name :-)
She very kindly upgraded us to one of their Premier Club Rooms on the 5th floor which was lovely, one of the nicest hotel rooms we have ever stayed in! The marble bathroom was beautiful. The beds were very comfortable.

However, as our room (555) was almost on the same height level as the Train/Dart line, it was far from a quiet room with trains passing every few minutes from early morning to late night. This disturbed our night's sleep and was very disappointing, particularly after my contact with Diana prior to arriving at the hotel. 

The breakfast was average, the hot food was unfortunately merely lukewarm and seemed far too small for purpose. If the room was full, there would have been barely any room to move!

The staff were friendly, however, and the hotel was generally very clean & beautiful and we would return if given a quiet room, we would not take breakfast though.
",3,2014,09,04
219,Fantastic,"Everything was great! The staff were really nice and very helpful. Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were nice and clean, great view of the city. Breakfast was good. Walking to shops or pubs took only 20-25 minutes. Or if you prefer taking taxis they're always waiting across the street. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,09,04
219,Nice place,"Nice hotel with a friendly staff.  Breakfast was average but dinner was pretty good and the bar staff was very nice.  A little disappointed to have to pay for parking though.  It was nice having the train station across the street, and the hotel was convenient to walk to and from the city centre.",4,2014,09,02
219,Great Value,"From start to finish the experience of the North Star hotel was brilliant. I was a bit skeptical when I got such a good deal for 2 nights B&B but when we arrived we weren't disappointed. The room was spotless, shower was great and the staff were so helpful. The room we had DID have the trainline running by the side of it but ask at the reception to be moved if you're bothered by it and I'm sure they'll accommodate. Luckily for us the trains weren't running over the weekend due to a strike though. 

The breakfast was a buffet and had everything you needed to set you up for the day. It catered for all.

The only thing I regret is that we didn't eat in the Hotel Restaurant as it smelt fantastic. The location is a tad out of the centre, a nothing walk of 5 minutes onto O'Connell street though. If you like a nice pint of ale then I recommend the BrewDock, it's on the same road as the North Star and serves a great selection of ales. The food wasn't the best (hence regretting not dining in the restaurant). 

We were leaving extra early to the airport one morning and were given a continental breakfast delivered to the room which should of cost us 6 euros each but free of charge, nice touch. The airport shuttle bus can be arranged through the reception and only costs 5 euros per person & is well worth it, the first one is 07.10 though.

I would definitely go back and would also recommend the place to friends and family so give it a try.",5,2014,09,02
219,"Average Hotel Room, Friendly Staff","My husband and I arrived in Dublin at 8 a.m. for a week tour by rail.  Bus from Dublin airport using Airlink is 6 Euros and drops you off just around the corner from the North Star Hotel near the Connolly train station.  .  Easy walk to front door.  Note: The name Premier Club Suites is deceiving.  Suites are on upper floors and we did not have one since we booked through a tour company and had a lesser value room.   I would give it two and half stars for comfort.

Very friendly, helpful desk staff.  Room was not ready upon arrival and the staff stored our luggage until we returned at 12:30 pm.  Room was ready when we got back from a walk to check out the neighborhood.  Unfortunately it was a Sunday and most businesses (including restaurants) are closed.  Note: Most restaurants open at 12 noon or 12:30 pm for lunch.  We were given Room 268 which is up 12 stairs and through a hall with two more steps before you get to the building behind the front desk area.  If you are handicapped, there is no elevator at the reception area.  You have to use steps to go downstairs (6 steps) or up 12 steps to reach an elevator.

Our room was what Americans would call the second floor (European is First floor).  We were in the rear of the building.  The noise was so bad from being just one floor above the street.  We did not fall asleep until 2 in the morning when cars quit going by and honking their horns and people stopped partying outside the windows.  Two nights of this was enough for me and I could not wait to leave for Limerick.  

The room apparently had been recently renovated with carpeting and a new bathroom.  There was one full bed and one twin bed.   Typical European bathroom with just a tub/shower.  Always hard to step up into the tub to use the shower.  Plenty of closet space and a safe.  Television is sparse with only 9 channels.  One electrical outlet did not work so our iPad was not charging, so check your outlets before you try to charge something.  

Went to dinner at the McGettigans Cookhouse and Bar.  Typical pub food.  Had a great burger and of course beer.  They also offered a Margarita as their special drink.  They were confused when I asked for a Margarita on the Rocks with no salt.  The taste was OK, but not what you would expect in North America.  Bar staff was very friendly.  The only problem was at lunch on a Saturday there was only one waitress and she was overwhelmed.

WiFi is included in room rate which made it nice to check our e-mail and weather for Dublin.

Only one suggestion is get a Premiere Suite.  Regular rooms are sparse and the beds not comfortable.  Our second stay a week later was on the opposite side of the building and on the fourth floor.  Room was quiet after the train stopped running about 10 p.m.  Room was the same with one full and one twin bed.  Bath had been renovated.  Rooms were always clean and everything in order.",3,2014,09,01
219,Lovely Hotel,Stayed in the North Star a few times very good hotel very clean staff very friendly. Got upgraded to the Oscar  Wild Suite second last visit. King size bed beautiful room lovely decorated. Connolly rail station just across the road.,4,2014,09,01
219,Very good :),Great location - across from the train station and a 10 min walk to O'Connell Street. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was beautifully decorated and rooms were up to standard. Overall i had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend to anyone,5,2014,09,01
219,No complaints!,"I stayed here for two nights a few weeks ago. Nothing but good things to say about this hotel! The decor is tasteful and modern and the rooms are spacious, quiet and feel luxurious - Great for the price!
The location is excellent, especially for anyone coming into Dublin by Bus and travelling about on foot/public transport - its right across from the Luas station and round the corner from the bus Aras.
Good area too, busy but not bunged - nice vibe about the place!",4,2014,09,01
219,Nice place for a beer,"Some of the pubs round by Connelly look a bit sketchy to say the least, so we were rather pleased to find a decent old-school station hotel with a decent bar.  Good Guinness and not too pricey - though don't be fooled by their claim of having 'craft ale', it's not true!

Would actually consider staying in the hotel next time i'm over, just on the strength of the bar!",4,2014,09,01
219,Nice hotel but staff miserable ,"Stayed here for 3 nights this August, room was beautiful as was the rest of the hotel but the staff working there have to be some of the most miserable rude people I have ever met. The restaurant in the hotel mcgettigans is lovely, food amazing and staff in there seemed a lot friendlier ",4,2014,08,31
219,Average hotel,"I found the North Star hotel quite good.  It is across the road from Connolly train station, our room was average size, but the bed was very uncomfortable, did not sleep, pillows and mattress were quite hard.  Staff were friendly and location was good, 10 min walk to city centre.",3,2014,08,29
219,City centre location,"First off, this place has either a brilliant location or it'll drive you nuts. 

Rooms at the front will get street noise from a)traffic b) tram and c) train. The train noise also has vibration

Rooms out the side or rear won't be as noisy. It didnt bother me at all but if you're the type to grumble, do yourselves a favour and book somewhere else.

Room itself; clean, tidy and well organised. Ironing board was a bonus, free WiFi around the hotel was reasonably quick

The bar/restaurant attached is well stocked, food is great and drinks well priced.

I got there by Air coach, jumped off at O'Connell St, walked straight down Talbot St to the end, took maybe 5 minutes from the coach drop off point

There's a spar shop next door for anything you might have forgotten and hotel staff are really helpful

Extras - residents lounge is a quiet area to get work done or just have some space to do your thing and is nicely thought out",4,2014,08,27
219,North Star Hotel Dublin,"My Husband and I  took a rail break and stayed at the North Star hotel for one night. Our room 212 was a very odd shape but was well decorated, clean and spacious. The staff were courteous and the breakfast was good.  I have only given a two star rating because we never got a wink of sleep, there appeared to be some type of generator underneath our room  and it.  was very noisy all night long. We phoned reception about it and were informed that they would deal with it. But it continued all night. on checking out we mentioned  the noise and lack of sleep to the receptionist.She apologised and said that they normally had complaints from room 208 about noise and not 212!",2,2014,08,27
219,This is my go-to in Dublin,"I like that the hotel is near the bus and train stations.  It is the perfect distance from all the action.  There's a great chipper a few paces up.  The lobby, bar and restaurant are just right.  The overnight parking situation is very good and affordable.  If you tire of walking the hotel is close enough to all the landmarks that a cab is nice and cheap.  I love the recessed lighting in the ceiling. It's our go to place in Dublin.  We really enjoyed it.",5,2014,08,26
219,A nice weekend away.,"Firstly I visited this hotel 3 years ago and it was nice then but since the renovation it is a lot smarter and trendier, I booked this weekend break for my partner as a birthday surprise the lady I emailed regarding a room upgrade was lovely and tried helping me as much as possible, when we first arrived the gentleman at reception was helpful and polite, we paid for a room upgrade and was not disappointed for an extra 30euro a night we got a lush room with a small balcony, the room was clean and spacious and the added extra of the luxury lounge was an added plus.
now the breakfast was just as good if not better than I remember freshly cooked food and helpful waiting staff.
the restaurant was lovely and good value for money the food was tasty and delightfully presented.
now the only thing I did have a problem with on the stay was apart from the 1 polite receptionist as stated at the beginning the 3 other receptionists we dealt with throughout our stay didn't seem to want to help us and quite frankly didn't seem to want to even be at the hotel. I'm not one to complain but just saying a smile goes a long way.

but apart from this everything else was wonderful and I would happily recommend anyone to come to this hotel as the location is spot and its comfortable luxury.
so many thanks for a great stay hope to be back one day soon!",4,2014,08,26
219,very nice,Very nice hotel very good location to city center this hotel had the best room I have seen for any hotel in its price range food was very good also as was the staff most help full it's a very fresh hotel in every way,4,2014,08,25
219,Good location... Poor bed/mattress,"I found this hotel has a good location which is close to the tram line (essential to get to the Guinness factory) and 15/20 min walking distance from temple bar/trinity college.

We requested a room in the newly furnished part of the hotel- which is said to be quieter. However, we still needed to close the window at night to reduce the noise.

No early check in, and late check out costs 10euro per hour. But staff accomodating with locking our bags away for us.

The mattress was horrendous- you could see a visable 'dip' in the middle of the mattress (which was concave in shape). After our first night in the hotel we reported it to the concierge. However, nothing was done to the room- and there was no follow up communication regarding the bed.

Breakfast ordered to the room was lovely. The porter was overly persistant about being paid then and there for the food (in cash only) rather than adding the bill to the room. 

Overall, pleasant enough room, lovely shower and good location. Poor mattress with ongoing noise throughout the night.",3,2014,08,24
219,Little Known Treat,"My husband and I stayed at The North Star Hotel for a wee mid-week break. We were impressed by the staff, the decor is very fresh and morning and it must be mentioned the price was amazing!!! 
Very good location, 100 yards away from the train station and five minutes from O'Connell Street.
The in-house restaurant has a great atmosphere and a good menu selection. 
The only draw-back we experienced was breakfast, although we upgraded to a Full Irish Breakfast, all we were offered was hash browns and fried bread rather than our soda and potato.
Do not be put oof though, we are planning to stay here again soon, we'll just take the standard breakfast option though.",4,2014,08,23
219,very nice,"We started our trip through Ireland here.  They were really great, even putting up with 2 very jet-lagged and tired tourists upon check-in.  
You will have to carry your luggage up a flight of stairs to get to the elevators, and not always was there someone to assist you.  The room was pretty nice, although for 30 Euro you can upgrade (if available, which it wasn't when we were there).  The shower had been ""fixed"" and was a little confusing, but worked well once we figured it out.  The view we had, well, it was an alley and I believe there was a pub nearby because we could hear people well into the night.  There was not much for AC, so we had to keep the window open until the noise just got to be too much.  
One really bright note is the in-house restaurant.  It was great-friendly staff, great food, great atmosphere!  Another shiny note is the man working the tour desk.  He was really sweet, had a lot of useful information and even gave me a great idea for the shileliegh I picked up.",3,2014,08,22
219,we love Ireland,"for first time travelers to Ireland we could not have been happier with this hotel. it has access to everything a traveller needs to have a good stay, transport, restaurants, (including the hotels own) shops and sights. it was clean and very comfortable. these kind of experiences when traveling make you want go back, thank you.",5,2014,08,21
219,The best Four Star Hotel in Ireland,"I stayed in the North Star hotel two weeks ago for three days and two nights. I have visited many cities and towns in Ireland over the last few years , however none of the hotels are anything compared to the North Star Hotel.The North Star Hotel ticks all the boxes , I must compliment the exterior and interior design of the hotel is magnificently beautiful with fantastic bedrooms especially the Premier rooms   .The location of the hotel could not be better , it is in the heart of Dublin city centre .Also the Mc Gettigans Cookhouse is a top quality restaurant , the food was delicious and the staff were so friendly and welcoming throughout the hotel , in particular one of the breakfast room staff whose name i cant remember , he was a red headed gentleman , who on my first morning in The North Star Hotel was so welcoming and helpful . Over all my stay in The North Star Hotel was magnificent and I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone who wishes to visit Dublin and I cant wait until I visit Dublin again",5,2014,08,21
219,Brilliant start to our holiday,"Me and my boyfriend checked in to the hotel the day before we went on holidays. We were upgraded to a premier suite which was absolutly beautiful and had a view of croke park from the balcony. The room was very spacious, comfortable and clean. The staff at the hotel where  very friendly and welcoming espically the manager Rhona who was very accommodating.I look forward to my next stay at the hotel, would definatly highly  recommend it.",5,2014,08,21
219,"Great hotel, dicey location","I stayed here with my partner and daughter for five nights. The hotel itself is very nice and located across the street from Connolly Station which worked for us to head to Wexford after our stay. Some rooms have been renovated and those are beautiful. (We did not get one of those rooms, but my sister did so I was able to see it first hand). Our room was fine, the beds were comfy, clean and for us that was all that mattered. It was quiet as well for a good nights sleep. The staff is exceptional, accomodating and friendly. Our room did come with breakfast, which was continental, and for another cost (about 12 euros) you got a ""full"" or hot breakfast. Absolutely NOT worth it. The full breakfast only gives you few more hot food options, so perhaps the addition of eggs, bacon/sausage & beans. If you must have these things, take a short walk and go find it for a fraction of this price. Otherwise the continental is quite filling and just fine. (Tea/coffee, yogurt, cheese, ham, danish, hot/cold cereal, fruit and more!)  I did not go to the restaurant so I can't speak to that part of it.
It is easy to get to from the airport, a quick ride on Airlink and it dropped us off right around the corner.
Location:  The location is not really in city center but close enough of a walk. But for about the same price you can be much closer to it all. There are also good places to buy things like trinkets or toothpaste. The only part I found dissapointing is that the area is not the best. At night walking back the area is not busy and very desolate. If you are alone, or just overall skittish about these kinds of things, perhaps looking closer to the river or the other side of it may be a better option (Christchurch area). This is the only reson I am giving it a 4 verus a 5.",4,2014,08,19
219,Excellent Hotel,An unexpected surprise...circumstances beyond our control we ended up staying in this hotel ....In one word 'a Gem ' lively bar food ...great staff and the room is as good if not better than any hotel in Dublin...parking great value as well and right in the city centre ....well worth a visit,4,2014,08,17
219,excellent hotel,"This hotel was lovely couldn't fault it we even got a free upgrade , rooms lovely bed comfy and bathroom very clean, breakfast lovely and very filling , pub and restaurant very good and quick service from bar staff, would stay here again if came back to Dublin , also close to  connelly street",4,2014,08,15
219,Great Experience,"Went here for a family vacation Our 1st trip to Ireland.  We had a great experience at this hotel. Here's all the reasons why: Lovely staff (very helpful, remembered us), nice room (linens/beds), easy location (walk right down to the river and all the action, easy highway access in/out of town), nice ambience (nice pub downstairs and lots of sitting areas), convenience (free wifi, 24 hr secured parking). Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend the hotel",5,2014,08,15
219,Unexpected Upgrade On Arrival,"We visited to Dublin to celebrate herself's latest birthday. The trip began with an unexpected upgrade on arrival at The North Star Hotel to a Premier Club room up on the top floor, which incidentally, offers a most comfortable lounge too. We found the accommodation most comfortable, but more so we thought the service throughout the hotel was very good. Breakfast kept us going all day so much so we could not manage a desert on our final night - tip: go enjoy a meal at Fire in The Mansion House!!",5,2014,08,15
219,"Good location, friendly staff, good room.","Stayed with my partner, we received a complimentary upgrade straight away to a premier room on the 6th floor, a very good start. The room was excellent, TV signal was a bit shaky but it wasn't that important, as it was only used at night time. Air conditioning didnt work which was disappointing, and the DART trains passed by right in front of the rooms which could be annoying for some, but didn't bother us. Staff at reception were friendly, breakfast was tasty. Would suggest putting the drinks in a fridge to keep them cool, they were actually warm, warm water or orange/apple juice isn't nice with breakfast! Hotel is a 10 minute walk from the center of O'Connell street, very near LUAS station which provides good transport links to the center and docklands.",4,2014,08,15
219,Business and leisure,"I booked a family room for the stay for myself and my two teenage children, and whilst the room possessed enough beds (a double and a single), everything else was as per the single/double occupancy room I had previously had stayed in.  The first room we received had a sink that did not drain and a toilet that did not flush, but we were offered another room as soon as I complained.  The second room was adequate, however the AC was too noisy to have on at night, fortunately the Dublin weather meant that was not an issue after the first day or two!
I also used the laundry service, however this was a frustrating experience.  I sent a bag of clothes, including shirts, for the wash/dry/iron service advertised in the hotel services folder, and received back washed and dried clothes, but un-ironed - not great for work the next morning.  Again the hotel resolved this within 24 hours, however I would not expect that this sort of thing should happen in a hotel that insists on its 4-star rating.
The breakfast service is adequate, and my family and I enjoyed evening meals in McGettigans.",3,2014,08,12
219,Excellent!,"Perfect in every way. Staff very helpful and available to help with every need, whether it was questions on Dublin or hotel needs. The location is brilliant - walking distance from Connolly and Lucas - parking available too which was a plus! Thank you for a wonderful stay. ",5,2014,08,10
219,Overall - lovely!,"We had a lovely stay at the North Star Hotel in Dublin. We found it was in a good location, within walking distance of many of the attractions, the bar was relaxing, breakfast tastt and staff very friendly.

The only downfall waa our room was at the front of the hotel on the main road. The room was boiling, boiling hot, with no fan provided, so we had to have the window open 24/7 which ended up being quite noisy.

We coped and it didn't ruin our staff.

We would definitely recommend this place!",4,2014,08,10
219,Very nice hotel well commumicated,"We have been in the hotel for two nights. The room was very clean, well decorated and with a lot of facilities; hairdresser, iron,...the restauurant was very very good. About the location is not in the center but 10 min walking and just near the first station of Lya tram.
 ",4,2014,08,08
219,Staff and Hotel.,"Your staff was very helpful and accommodating. They were right on top of things. The room was pleasant. The Hotel is about a ten to fifteen minute stroll to the city center. The North Star is just across the street from the railway station, so its handy for rail travelers. My wife and I stayed at the North Star for the two nights we were in Dublin. I would recommend this Hotel to everyone",5,2014,08,06
219,Surprise anniversary stay,"We decided to stay in Dublin for a night for our anniversary, and checked out some last minute websites - there was a surprise hotel for a super cheap rate, so we booked it on a whim and it turned out to be the North Star Hotel.

Reception is small and friendly, the layout of the hotel is a little strange, with lots of small corridors and inter-joining buildings, but all in all for the price it is a great value hotel! 

The room was everything you would expect it to be, tidy and clean with normal hotel type things. For a more budget hotel, everything was well designed and the bed was large, lush and super comfortable.

We didn't eat in the hotel, but were really happy with the close proximity to shops, restaurants, bars etc. For the price we were extremely happy with our stay and would recommend the North Star Hotel!",4,2014,08,06
219,Our 'home' in Dublin for a week,"We were worried when we first arrived, as it appears that a train (some sort of electric tram?) runs right through the middle of the hotel.  But whether it does or not you cannot tell from inside the hotel.  We never heard anything nor felt any indication of it's presence.  The Northstar is a strange layout.  The elevator to the rooms is not located on the ground floor.  it's up a steep set of stairs and down a long hall (that crosses over a street I believe).  Carrying our luggage all that way was difficult for me as I am a senior.  Fortunately you only do that when you arrive and when you leave ... since we were there for a week the rest of the time it was just a the stairs and walk but no luggage.  Everything else was as we would expect from any decent hotel.  The staff was friendly the 'full Irish' breakfast was very good, the room was large enough and clean, there were makings for tea or coffee in the room etc. etc.  Would definitely consider staying there again.",4,2014,08,06
219,Garth Brooks Weekend,"As our GB weekend was doomed, we decided to abandon our previously booked Travelodge which was now a bit too far away( despite being described as city centre). We were now much handier to see things and liked the hotel.  Food in the bistro was excellent. Room was a bit noisy but don't know where the noise came from. Would go back.",4,2014,08,06
219,Could've been better,"We stayed a this hotel for a total of 3 nights: a single night when we first flew into Dublin, then two nights at the end of our vacation in Ireland.  The first night we were given a fairly nice room that looked recently refurbished.  Only problem was there was a place on the floor next to the bed that when one stepped on it, it sounded like the entire floor was giving way.  Kind of annoying when getting up at night to use the WC.

About 6 days later we checked back in for our last two nights in Dublin.  There was only me and my wife but we were given a ""family room"" with 3 beds--a double and two twins.  Had enough towels, shampoo and soap to service a small army.  Problem was the AC was not up to par.  That week the temps in Dublin were unseasonably warm and the room was very uncomfortable.  We asked to be moved and were told there were no other ""family rooms"" available.  We explained we were only two and didn't need a family room.  When we came back from touring we were told that the AC had been fixed and was working ""perfectly"" and we could keep our family room.  Sadly, the AC was NOT fixed, but instead of making a stink we rode it out our last night there.  

The staff was very polite and seemed to try to work with us, so I don't know where the resistance was coming from.  I'd avoid staying here if possible.  

On the plus side it almost across the street from the tram and Connelly Station, making it very convenient for town travel.",2,2014,08,05
219,Very clean and good location,"Great experience overall.. Lovely food, great location and friendly staff.One thing to mention is the car park.. The hotel car park is run by a seperate company which the guest is required to hand over the keys, me and partner where not very comfortable with this so we requested to keep the keys but the company would not oblige. We then spoke with the hotel manager who was ever so helpful and got our keys back. This is the first time of such a policy and totally disagree!! But as I stated it is not the hotels fault and they where very helpful. ",5,2014,08,05
219,Great hotel in a good location,"Stayed for one night here in July 2014. Central location ten minute walk to city centre. On site parking available which is a plus in Dublin! Rooms were clean and a good size. Good breakfast plenty of choice, and friendly staff. Well definitely stay here next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2014,08,05
219,"Great staff, great location, great rooms, great foot and even greater drink!","From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, everything was perfect. We arrived way before check in, expecting just to leave our bags, only to find out that we'd been upgraded and that our room was ready. 
Later we had lunch in the restaurant, which was delicious, and the barman, when bringing us our drink, even stopped to have a chat. Later when we had lunch, the staff were all lovely, and they took the time to send us in the right direction for a bit of craic. 
All the staff were really lovely and the room was really clean. 
Couldn't fault our stay at all! We'll definitely be back!! ",5,2014,08,05
219,Back in Dublin,"This time we went up to the mountains a few times, we did a show at a fancy place. 
We were at Jonny Fox place a nice pub.
The hotel is in a good location for most things you want¬¥s to do. The room is excellentvery comfortable beds and very well cleaned. Staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast is nice.",5,2014,08,05
219,North Star Review,Only pity was that our visit was for one night only (missing the GB thing!).  The hotel was in a good location for most things we wanted to do.  The room was excellent being larger than expected together with a large en-suite - very comfortable beds and very well cleaned.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was out of this world - very good choice and good quality.  Cannot fault and am now counting down when we can visit again - but for longer.  Will be booking this accommodation again.,5,2014,08,04
219,Cool decor in a decent spot to be able to walk to most of Dublin's attractions!,"We stayed a few nights on the 4th floor, I don't think these rooms were lucky enough to have enjoyed the refurbishment but we're ok enough. The only problem was even when the window was closed it sounded like it was open and you could hear everything...... We asked to change room which the staff happily did but ended of right next door with the same problem!!

The staff are amazing and the bar staff next door and restaurant staff in the breakfast room very attentive. Good good as well and not too expensive for the old tipple compared to the rest of Dublin.

All in all a good stay and I would recommend it.

If we didn't have the hiccup with our room(s) it would have got 5 stars!",4,2014,08,02
219,Amazing! Third time staying here,"This is firstly my third time staying here. It just gets better every time! We stayed here during the very warm weather, but the air con was fabulous! It was so great in the room I loved it. The beds are just so so comfy (hard to get out of in the morning).. The rooms and hotel are just spotless.. And of course the service in the North Star hotel are just top class. Every single member of staff have the best manners I have ever came across. They make you feel so welcome. Can I also add in that the air freshener spray that is in the corridors are out of this world too wish I had them in my home! As well as that, yes it is beside connolly station but in my 2 say stay I heard the trains during the day fair enough, but at night I heard none and I only heard one in the morning so the train noise is nothing to complain about.. Breakfast was so tasty yet again and room service is perfect and so cheap! Thank you sooo much North Star and your wonderful staff I cannot wait to book it again!! ",5,2014,07,29
219,What more could you want!,"Stayed for the ""no show GB"". Hotel and food excellent. Parked in hotel car park 8 euro per day so cheaper than hilton in Belfast! ! Excellent wee bar and food. Breakfast plentiful and fresh. Not a rip off either. Rooms have everything needed and air con was a dream. Room lovely and cool on the really hot weekend. Connolly station across the road for the luas and was handy for scooting about instead of walking about I'm the heat. Definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,07,28
219,No air conditioning??,"We stayed in this hotel as we arrived in Ireland and at the end of our vacation.  I would consider our 1st room ""tired"".  The room was definitely clean but could use an update. It was air conditioned.  The morning  breakfast buffet (not included) was basic.  No complaints on this-just basic unless you wanted the more expensive option.  Upon our return after traveling around Ireland, we were put in another wing.  It was totally renovated and done nicely.  But there was no air conditioning in the renovated wing.  We were given three fans to keep cool.  Our room was on the main street.  The street was loud so we had to close the windows and use the fans.  I don't understand the logic of nicely renovating a wing but no air conditioning??  I think I would choose another option if I was to return.",3,2014,07,27
219,Stopover before heading to Wexford,"Stayed on a Friday night before setting off to visit family the next day. Arrived in the middle of a torrential downpour, so was grateful to check in quickly, Room was very comfortable, nice bathroom and tea/coffee facilities. We headed downstairs to McGettigans, nice atmosphere and reasonably priced drinks (we went to one of their bars in Dubai so were keen to visit).
Great breakfast selection available, lots of choice and you could eat to your fill.
Would definitely choose again on future visits to Dublin,easy to get to and great transport links.",4,2014,07,27
219,D and G do Dublin,"The North Star Hotel is well located. Sitting just across the road from Connolly railway station and a five minute walk from the main bus station, the hotel provides excellent access to public transport. The Airlink bus from Dublin Airport dropped us round the corner from the hotel while the bus returning to the airport leaves from a bus stop just outside the nearby bus station. The hotel is also convenient for Dublin's main attractions. O'Connoll Street is a ten minute walk away while another five minutes will take you to the vibrant Temple Bar area, Trinity College or the shopping area around Grafton Street. We stayed in the older part of the hotel on the first floor facing onto Amiens Street which is a very busy thoroughfare resulting in some traffic noise in the room. The room itself was large, clean and spacious with a well equipped bathroom. We visited Dublin during a heat wave which meant that the room did become extremely hot and stuffy due to lack of air conditioning and a window that only opened a few inches. Two fans had been thoughtfully provided in the room which helped to keep temperatures down as much as possible. Staff in the hotel were extremely friendly and courteous. The breakfast  which was included in our room rate, was very good with a full Irish cooked breakfast available alongside the standard continental breakfast fare which included fresh fruit salad, cereals, cold meat, cheese and bread. All in all we had a very enjoyable stay in the North Star Hotel and it is an hotel we would happily return to if we visit Dublin again.",4,2014,07,26
219,Can I park your car ?,Highly recommended not to park in the adjoined parking as I had my car key lost by the parking attendant very poor organisation and afterwards no form of apology !!!! Hotel management helpful in some respects but generally didn't want to know !!!,1,2014,07,26
219,Ace,Could not fault this place.wet on a wowcher  deal costing 200 quid for 2 nights for 2 people including flights.we were in amazement at the hotel we ended up staying in.rooms 1st class staff 1st class food 1st class .All in all just a wonderful stay.thank you north star for giving us such a memorable weekend.,5,2014,07,24
219,Nice hotel but not 4 stars,"The hotel is fairly central and only a few metres from one of the Airport bus drop-off points. There's a Tesco nearby for snacks and only 5 mins from the river and about 15 minutes to the City Centre. The wifi can be hit and miss depending on your room. The breakfast room is windowless and a bit claustrophobic. The fruit is tinned which is below the standard for most 4 star hotels. The Continental Breakfast option is fairly limited. The staff are very polite and friendly and they offer a shuttle to the Airport for ‚Ç¨1 than the bus but only runs every 2 hours. When you arrive at the airport, buy a 3 Day Explorer Pass as it's valid on the Airport Bus, Tour Bus and local buses (but not the tram). ",3,2014,07,23
219,"Good location, impressive interior, pleasant stay","Hotel is conveniently located and has beautiful decor. We were satisfied with our room, which had a pleasant view, and with the quality of the food. Staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, a great stay.",4,2014,07,23
219,Just o.k.,"North Star Hotel has a lot of work to do before it can be considered a nice hotel. The building itself is charming, but the hotel misses the mark. One side of the hotel does not have A.C., that same side has been completely remodeled too. The rooms with A.C. were not updated. Seems to me that they would want to update and add A.C. 
The location is worst of all. It is directly across from the Connelly train station, noise is a constant. Not to mention, the surrounding neighborhood. I would not travel here on foot beyond dusk. It seems that the hotel is offered in a lot of trail packages, that must be the only way it is staying open. 
I would recommend only to young students with little money--cleaner than a hostel.",3,2014,07,22
219,"Good, not great","Rented a family room.  Room not very big for a family room.  Air conditioning barely kept the room cool, definitely not cold.  Did not tell the staff about it so don't know if they could have improved it.  WiFi was given to us at no charge, but it did not reach deep inside our room.  The kids laid on the floor in front of the door to obtain service.  Bathroom clean.  Beds were strangely slanted from the feet downward to the head of the bed.  Blow dryer pretty much useless.",3,2014,07,21
219,Great welcome in Dublin,"We stayed two nights here whilst touring Ireland.  It is opposite the entrance to Connolly station so perfect and only 10 minutes on the tram to Heuston station.  There is a really warm welcome, nice bar and outside space for a nightcap after being out on the town.  It is a 15 minute walk across the river to the main streets of Dublin, but this means the hotel area is fairly quiet.  Wifi is really hit an miss, but you will log on eventually, speed is good once you jump on.  Breakfast is served in a hot windowless basement, and a bit stuufy and claustraphobic.  It is great though and set us up for the day.  A bit expensive though,so eat all you can.  All in all a great hidden gem and great for getting around.",4,2014,07,20
219,Excellent,"We enjoyed our stay at North Star.  The staff was wonderful.  Over our stay in Dublin, we were in two different rooms.  Both were clean and nicely furbished.  Loved our bathroom (especially with the second room:-)  it was huge and beautifully remodeled.  We loved the location of North Star to all the places we wanted to see in Dublin (Temple Bar, Henry Street, Grafton Street)",5,2014,07,20
219,"Great Location , Staff , Food , Room just to hot !","JUst back from the north star ,very clean ,  lovely hotel , great location ,  very near  the train , and  bus station ,Breakfast was absolutely superb with very helpful and attentive staff , We had a room in the older part of the hotel (room 210) initial reaction was clean modern and well appointed ,with small opening window ,
 It Was always very warm but as the day drew on it became even hotter  and stuffier  (i think it must have been over a kitchen and caught afternoon sun ) , so we opened the little window , (no aircon) , Problem was its within 20 yards of a busy railway , not much of a problem in the day with double glazing  but a nightmare in the evening and early morning as it was just so hot ,even with the widow wide open ,! Sleep was very interrupted which spoiled our break .
If we went again would try and stay in the newer part  of the hotel (premier rooms ?) 
The management really need to address these issues , as the hotel itself is a great place to stay and eat .",3,2014,07,20
219,Ireland,"The hotel was in a very convenient location. Nice first impression and most of the staff was friendly and helpful. The only issue we had was the air conditioner didn't work and our room was very hot. We asked if we could move to another room, but they said the hotel was booked, except for the upgraded rooms. They offered to move us for $30.00 euros more per night.",3,2014,07,20
219,Made my experience in Ireland that much richer.,"Staff was wonderful! They were so helpful and welcoming. Rooms are gorgeous (though, A/C was either not working or the room didn't have one-- didn't deter us from enjoying it). Great location. Loved it.",5,2014,07,19
219,A little tired,"This hotel has seen better days. Room was OK, comfortable bed and clean. 
Only 7 TV channels, no sockets near the bed (had to charge phone/alarm across the room, very inconvenient), bathroom lighting was very dark.
In room Wi-Fi reception
 was so appalling it was pointless trying to go on line.
Buffet breakfast was reasonably good and the Bar served excellent local food, reasonably priced with friendly service.
",3,2014,07,19
219,A GREAT REFURBISHED ESTABLISHED HOTEL,"A major facelift has brought this hotel into the 21st century. The bedrooms are well furnished with lots of space and really comfortable with good lighting. The buffet breakfast gives a wide choice that will cater for most tastes.

On arrival you will get a warm and welcoming reception and feel very much at home. Situated over the road from Connolly Station and a short walk from the central bus station this hotel is well sited to help you enjoy Dublin",4,2014,07,19
219,Bad A/C and beds not worth the stay,"We stayed for three nights

The good part was location.   Just a short walk up the street to most of the main areas.  However this hotel is not a 4 star hotel (more like 2 1/2)    We had two rooms and the a/c was not working and the beds were not flat so you wanted to ""roll"" into the middle of the bed all night.   Front desk staff were interesting and my opinion on them is mixed.   They definitely have a attitude.   We arrived early and know that it was not the official check in time.  Thought we would ask just incase.   After checking and telling me ""no room are available"" I got the lecture that checkin was not till 2:00 and why would I even ask....   funny part was not 2 mins later when we asked about leaving our bags he finds two rooms ready for us to check in.

Everything about the hotel is old and not maintained.  From the tv's to the bathrooms.    This could be a great place with some basic annual upkeep every year.",2,2014,07,19
219,Not at all a 4 Star hotel ,"We went to Dublin for the first time and wanted something really close to everything and this hotel certainly has the greatest location ever, no doubt about that. Though, the rooms were not living up to the standard of 4-star hotel at all ! We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and we had to complain 2 times over the room and housekeeping. First problem was that we payed nearly a 100 euro for a night in this hotel ( bit expensive so you expect to get what you pay for). In our room there was so hot and air condition did not work at all. The bath had to low a shower head so you could not really stand up in the shower ( this could not be moved). After we complained about this we got a new room, but here our room didn't have any trash bags so we had to put all of our trash on a tiny coffee table, which was very disgusting and very unprofessional. Last but not least all the power went in our room one night, and only in our room. So when we complained again we got a free breakfast to the value of 25 euros it was a gratis but still not enough to compensate for what we was expecting from a 4- star hotel. So great location. But everything else, also the hotels restaurant is expensive and not worth your while trying. 
",2,2014,07,18
219,North Star Hotel Dublin,"After previously arranging to arrive early and have facilities to change for a business meeting we were told that one of our rooms was ready and all 4 of us were checked in and agreed that we could share just to change.  However our ""ready"" room was still occupied when we entered.  On  informing the housekeeper she arrived and couldn't be more apologetic and immediately offered us a complimentary breakfast (which we were planning to go and purchase anyway) to while away some time until the rooms could be made ready.

We arrived before 10.00am so had expected only some store-room type of changing facilities until the usual check in at 2.00pm/3.00pm.  We had booked 2 twin-bedded rooms but we got 2 small suites with a sitting area, small but very useable kitchen and 2 bedrooms (1 double and 1 twin).  The rooms when we were finally settled (straight after breakfast) were fairly spacious, comfortable and very clean with ample tea/coffee making facilities.  (Apparently the previous occupants had checked out but not yet removed their baggage which is what had greeted us on entering.)

All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and that evening pointed us to a very local pub playing Irish music and serving great Guinness.  They went to some lengths to locate our meeting address and arrange a taxi to get us there, even advising on the approximate cost.

We had dinner with our business colleagues, so cannot comment, but breakfasts were very hearty and delicious (even the free one).

By the time we went to bed it would have taken more than music to disturb us, but personally I never heard anything untoward.  Such disturbance may be a factor of your room location.

I guess we were very fortunate in being allocated suites instead of simple twin rooms, but from everything I saw I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",4,2014,07,14
219,Great hotel for  short break,"Just returned home after 2 days at the North Star hotel. Very friendly, efficient staff and the room was very clean and pleasant. Only down side was our room was quite close to the train track and was a little noisy. Breakfast had a good choose of food and the Irish breakfast had a good choice and everything was hot. The gentleman on the Concierge Desk was very entertaining.",4,2014,07,14
219,3rd stay,"Just back from my 3rd stay in the North Star hotel, its a fantastic base to visit Dublin from. Just across the road from Connolly station so very easy accessed. A train line does run by the hotel, but I couldnt hear it! So, not too big of a problem. We stayed in one of the superior rooms which is certainly worth the extra money, the rooms are beautiful and very big- with everything you need. A nice touch was the proper hair dryer - not common to get these in hotel rooms! The bed was so comfortable, and air conditioning was a bonus. Over all - a very comfortable stay. The staff were friendly and well presented. The major attraction of this hotel is the decor, room and common areas are all very tastefully decorated and make for a very calm and welcoming atmosphere. 5 minutes walk to O'Connell street, very central yet far enough away to be quiet. 15/20 minutes taxi ride from the airport cost less than 20 euro.",4,2014,07,14
219,Good location nice place,Although the hotel is a big labyrinth and hard to navigate - we enjoyed staying there last weel on our visit to Dublin. The location is great. Rooms are nice and the food is good. The receptionist were nice and helpful,4,2014,07,13
219,Close to being a really great hotel,"This hotel needs a few tweeks to become top shelf. They need to change the way to get to the elevators. It is a long walk especially for older people. The room was comfortable. The location is a ways to the center of Dublin, but not that inconvenient if you enjoy a walk. The staff was first rate. The bar and beer garden was fun.",4,2014,07,13
219,The terrible hotel to stay having music in the middle night,"I stay this hotel because of the groupon packgage, it's 1am but the music up floor still on and I was told it will keep aloud till 3am.never stayed in this kind of noisy hotel for vacation. Cannot go to sleep is going to drive me crazy.......",1,2014,07,12
219,Excellent place,"Our 4th stay at the North Star. Very clean, friendly & helpful staff. Not a bad word to say. About 10 min walk from O'connell street. Worth upgrading to premier king rooms as we have done for last 3 stays.  Also recommend the full Irish breakfast.",5,2014,07,12
219,Excellent hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel 4 times now with my boyfriend anytime we are up in the capital and it never fails to disappoint. The rooms are always spotless and staff are very friendly. The hotel is located directly across from Connelly station which can cause a bit of noise but overall it's perfect if you aren't too light of a sleeper. We ate in the adjoining restaurant on our recent trip and it was lovely, reasonably priced and good portions, what more could you ask for! Overall this is a great hotel and we will defiantly be back.",5,2014,07,11
219,Handy location,"I picked this hotel as it was on the bus route (number 53, stop about 80m away) to the Ferryport. It is also just opposite Connolly Station and many buses and the Luas pass the door. A 10 to 15 minute walk to O'Connell St. There is car parking on site, but tight to get in and out of.
The rooms are okay, but I couldn't get the wifi to work in the room. ",4,2014,07,11
219,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here with a friend for one night last week. Staff was very friendly. Our room was on the 5th floor facing the railway and unfortunately it did cause some noise. Breakfastroom and the breakfast itself were also excellent. 
Airport shuttle service was also a great. 
Before heading to the airport we had lunch in the restaurant of the hotel, The McGettigans Cookhouse & Bar and the food was also excellent!",4,2014,07,11
219,Very dissapointing,"This was the only terrible experience we had during our 8 day trip throughout Ireland. First, they claim they have a gated parking lot for guests. The lot is tiny. We drove around the block several times, but the entry was blocked by a car. We ended up having to park at an expensive paid lot several blocks away and walk to the hotel to check in. We asked the front desk staff about this, they called the lot, the lot said they had one spot left and that they would hold it for us. We told them it would take us about 20 minutes to retrieve our car and come back - ""sure, no problem."" We were there in less than 20 minutes but they gave the parking spot to someone else. After much discussion with the parking attendant, I was assured they could find space for us. Turns out, the space they found was in the ungated alley behind the hotel (we still had to pay the full price for ""gated parking""). 
Upon arrival, we asked to be placed in room that didn't face the train track. We were given a room that not only faced it, but was on the same level of it. Trains run from 5am-midnight. Ok, close the window to dim the noise.... But the rooms below the 5th floor don't have AC, so it becomes hot and stuffy in the room. Called the front desk but there were no rooms on a different floor or the other side of the hotel that we could switch to. They offered to bring us a fan. It was a desk fan. It didn't help. To top it off, the bed wasn't very comfortable either. Neither of us got a wink of sleep. 
We were told the next day that they might be able to switch us to a different room after checkout, but they couldn't guarantee that it would be on either a floor that had AC or in a part of the hotel that didn't face the train...AND we wouldn't be able to find out until early afternoon. There were very few rooms available at other hotels so we decided to check out early and change hotels rather than risk having to spend another sleepless night  at the North Star. Since it was less than 24 hours notice the hotel said they couldn't refund our room charge for the 2nd night. 
On a positive note. Staff was friendly and polite, even if unable to resolve out issues. Breakfast wasn't bad.",1,2014,07,08
219,Perfect for a short break,"I booked this as a surprise for my girlfriend and wasn't disappointed.  I was worried it could be a little far out of the city centre but it turned out to be just a short walk away or a taxi which was cheap enough.

We ordered room service on both days for breakfast and was well worth it and the breakfast was delicious.  The rooms themselves were clean, well equipped and perfectly comfortable for our two night stay.

We didn't eat at the hotel but we did have a drink in the bar where we met the friendliest bartender we've ever met!!",4,2014,07,08
219,Will always stay here when in Dublin,"Was in Dublin for a surgical conference. Found this hotel on the internet and booked it as it was in the right location(on foot); 10mins from conference hall, 10-15mins from Temple bar, 2mins to river front.  The hotel experience was 10/10. Right from the onset of my stay, until the end, I received nothing but great service. The staff were very friendly and helpful (i know that this should be a fundamental thing in all hotels, but we all have seen completely awful services right).  The room was excellent, a nice size, stylish and very clean. The hotel interior was that of a stylish boutique hotel, which is what I prefer. The breakfast room and breakfast was excellent.  To be honest, I'm finding extremely difficult to fault this place.  The price was just right.  I hope to stay there again on ,y next trip to Dublin. Thank  you to the hotel staff for making my trip there very enjoyable.",5,2014,07,07
219,Good Locality,"We enjoyed our stay at the North Star.  Other than having to change rooms because the radiator would not turn off, which made the room into a sauna.  We did not encounter any problems changing rooms and the staff we very helpful.  The rooms were cleaned every day.  The hotel is in a very good spot with the train (or Dart) not sure which is just across the road.  Unfortunately it was a couple of days into our stay that we discovered just how easy travelling in the train was.  Also we did get on a bus and were turned off because you have to have the right ""cash"" to board, but you live and learn.  Other than that we had a very nice stay in Dublin at this hotel.",4,2014,07,07
219,Brilliant,Stayed here for 1 night for kings of leon concert. Located just across from train station so very handy for catching train and they also do an airport shuttle. We were upgraded to a superior room for free which was beautiful. The place is just lovely and the staff so helpful and nice. Breakfast was lovely so much to choose from in a lovely room. Will definitely be coming back to stay here. I would recommend this hotel if going to dublin. ,5,2014,07,06
219,"Beautiful suites, great location.","I have stayed in the North Star Hotel Premier Club suites a few times now, and each time has been wonderful. On arrival, the staff are courteous and friendly, and the suites themselves are beautiful and spacious. With dual aspect windows/balconies, the views are great, and the location of the hotel is perfect. You are not so close to the main stretch of pubs and bars for the noise to be an issue, but everywhere you want (restaurants, shops, cultural sights, Temple Bar) is in easy walking distance. Definitely the place to stay for a memorable Dublin break!",5,2014,07,05
219,Family Trip,"Our family trip to Europe started and ended by flying through Dublin. The North Star Hotel was a good spot for our family to start our trip. Clean and close to city center. We were able to either walk or trolly to anything we wanted to see. We did not purchase the breakfast option, but found a nice coffee shop with good food one block away.",4,2014,07,04
219,"Great Stay, Clean, Convenient Location","We stayed five nights at the North Star Hotel and really enjoyed our stay. Our 5th floor room looked out over the train tracks and we were worried it might be noisy, but that was not the case. We received a complimentary upgrade on our room, which was large, clean and comfortable. The hotel lounge was a great place to meet up and relax with our friends who were also guests. Breakfast was nice and they even had gluten free bread for me. We took the PaddyWagon shuttle to and from the airport which worked out great. It is only about a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar area which was convenient for catching our day tours. Overall I would recommend the North Star Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2014,07,04
219,"Convenient Location, Lackluster Experience","Hotel is right across the street from Connolly train station and a short walk to the bus station and that means the public transport links are outstanding and within easy walking distance.  The Airlink 747 bus dropped us within a block of the hotel.  Our initial greeting by the front desk was chilly at best (we checked in very early but paid for the night before so we could be guaranteed a room at 8 am), counter to the warm Irish greetings we expected and got everywhere else we went.  Our room was a Premier room on the 7th floor and we didn't hear train noise.  It was quite small, but tastefully decorated with large comfy bed.  There seemed to be air conditioning vents and climate control, however the air conditioning didn't work.  This was a factor, because our two day stay was during very warm weather and the room was quite hot and stuffy.  We called three times to the front desk to have the problem fixed and were told someone would fix it.  No one ever came, and the problem wasn't fixed.  No updates were ever provided and we had to continually call.  The bathroom lights didn't work and neither did the hairdryer.  Someone did show up to fix that  - eventually.  Overall, the hotel had a few positives as well as a decent breakfast buffet served in a very stuffy breakfast room, but the negatives outweighed the positives.  I would find a different place to stay next time.",3,2014,07,03
219,Convenient city centre location,"Very convenient central location, just across street from Connolly train and DART station, five minutes walk from LUAS trams and main bus station means great transport links, and easy access to city centre, Temple Bar, etc. My room was in the Amiens street side, and despite the closeness of the DART line, I did not find the train noise objectionable. Food was of a good standard, staff friendly, helpful and efficient, and hotel spotlessly clean. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,07,03
219,Two Stays,"Stayed twice for two nights each, book ending a self drive around the Republic. First time were upgraded to a suite, which was roomy, modern and very comfortable. Second stay not so fortunate, but standard room was more than satisfactory. Hotel well situated within walking distance of Dublin centre, and Temple Bar area, although adjacent Talbot St is quite seedy. Breakfast excellent, although pretty standard, but breakfast room hot and noisy when full. Would stay here again.",5,2014,07,02
219,OK,"An ok hotel. Negative: tiny and not well equipped gym, not much to choose for breakfast, the internet did not work in the rooms - had to go in the hallway to get a signal.  Positive: great service and great location. ",3,2014,07,02
219,Good Location,Very friendly and helpful. Stayed in the back annex which was fine. Room clean and good wifi i room. The location was great - could easily walk to centre and close to train and tram system. Would stay here again.,4,2014,07,02
219,Great value.,We enjoyed our stay at the North Star Hotel in Dublin.  There was a kind and helpfull staff and good service. The room was quite good and clean. If we would return to Dublin we surely go back to the North Star. ,4,2014,07,02
219,Very inviting atmosphere.,"Great place.  They even checked us in early even though we arrived 9 hrs before allowed checkin. That saved us because we were exhausted. They even upgraded the room! 

I wish continental breakfast was free because it's definitely not worth an extra 8.50 for a bowl of cereal and orange juice. The hot breakfast was tasty though. That cost extra.

The restaurant was very good. Awesome food and although the world cup was on, it wasn't ridiculously noisy.

I noticed a lot of places in Ireland had a unique floor plan layout. This was another very neat one to explore. 

We thought we were in a prime location because of all the shopping,  but more exploring revealed that we were far from the area we wanted to be in. The downtown old part of Dublin. It is right next to the train station  though. This can be convenient, or cumbersome because of the loud trains. It didnt bother us though, although our window wouldn't close completely. 

I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay in Dublin.",5,2014,07,02
219,Very Nice Hotel,"Very nice hotel, room was spacious , very clean & tidy. Reception & bar staff were very helpful. The staff attended to you quickly when entering the breakfast room.Good English breakfast every morning ,choice of food was plentiful and hot. Train station just over the road and not too far to walk into the main centre of Dublin.",4,2014,07,02
219,Disappointing..,"I booked a premier room with hopes of using premiere lounge. Advertised pictures premiere lounge with food. But that is only a coffee machine, mineral water and tea bag no snack or any food. Room is clean but there is no sleepers or bathrobe. Beforr I booked this hotel I made a call to the hotel to find out about the lounge if they serves afternoon tea or evening cocktail in premier lounge. They staff a lady said yes. But I really disappointed there is nothing in there. I felt cheated.",3,2014,07,02
219,disappointment,"Booked a room in this hotel in November 2013 to stay overnight for the Dolly Parton concert . the booking form specified that the room I booked was air conditioned. When we got there we were allocated a nice room in the old section of the premises. The room was well equipped except for one big drawback it had old style radiators which despite the high temperatures at this time we were unable to switch off. I spoke to the receptionist who agreed to send somebody to solve the problem. within an hour a very young porter arrived, looked at the radiator and departed. silly me thought that a plumber would deal with the problem while we were at the concert but we arrived back to a sweltering room compounded by the noise from the trains which travelled just outside the window.",3,2014,06,30
219,3 days in Dublin,"Dont stay at the front of the hotel, very noisey with traffic and station opposite.
Resteraunt in the hotel was quality.
Rooms clean and tidy and the hotel was in a handy location, I would stay there again but would take earplugs just in case I got another front room",3,2014,06,29
219,"Pretty nice hotel, great wifi","We stayed in Dublin for a few days in June, and found the North Star to be one of the better inexpensive hotels in the area. We had no problem walking around and finding good places to eat and to visit from the hotel's location, and for the most part our room was very quiet. The wifi signal was pretty strong, which was nice. In regards to critiques of the hotel - my boyfriend and I arrived during a surprisingly intense hot spell, and found that the air conditioning could not compete with the heat, so we had to leave the windows open and allow some noise from the back street in. The first night we were there, there was also somebody in the hallway painting the walls, so we had to throw a towel under the door to prevent the paint fumes from wandering in (it seems this hotel is still doing minor refurbishments). Overall though, we had a very nice time.",4,2014,06,28
219,Great place to stay for your city trip,"Good hotel, clean, friendly, good location, nice breakfast but be carefull you don't eat too much ;-).
Used the airlink bus which was perfect to get to and from the hotel from the airport.

Also had some food in the restaurant which was very tasty!",5,2014,06,28
219,Inner city gem!,"We can't believe our luck in stumbling across this wonderful hotel, so close to Connolly station and a brisk 10 min walk from Grafton street.  The staff were friendly and efficient and the rooms were absolutely beautiful.  Clean, comfortable with all modern updates.   I have to mention also that this hotel adjoins McGettigan's bar which supplied us with amazing food when we didn't feel like going out late in the evening.  Even if I wasn't staying there I'd make the effort to eat here again.  Really good stews and cheese boards and a bartender who knows his stuff!  He was friendly and hospitable and made our time there an immense pleasure.  This hotel is near the train station but we didn't hear a thing - we slept soundly and happily during our stay.  Will definitely plan to return.",5,2014,06,27
219,The North Star,"Great hotel, nicely remodeled, delicious restaurant inside called McGettigan's. Directly across the street from Connolly station-easy access to the DART.  Very nice hotel for the price. Staff were very helpful. ",5,2014,06,26
219,Lovely stay,"We are already arranging to come back!!

What a lovely hotel, clean tidy, friendly staff.

Only complaint is our bathroom could do with some modernising as it has been partially retiled but not completely.",5,2014,06,26
219,It was a great place to stay.,"We started badly in Ireland with our luggage not arriving; still hasn't & it's day 5!
The room at North Star was perfect & the staff always accommodating & helpful. They helped source chargers & adapters for us.
Our only problem was the duvets which were too heavy & they were quickly changed for us.
All good.",5,2014,06,26
219,Everything I would expect,Only thing missing was  no water in room daily and need larger bath towels (bath sheets) when described balcony don't expect to sit out it's only to step out and view the surrounding area  but the hotel itself was a very pleasant stay the bar /restaurant/outside area very nice but I would say its ten minutes to o'connoll street and I'd say 15 maybe a bit longer to walk to grafton streat and that area ,4,2014,06,26
219,Great stay- wonderful customer service,"Great customer service. They helped keep with my bags, brought in a fan, delivered breakfast to my room for no extra charge, and even made breakfast earlier than breakfast hours for me because I had an early flight.",5,2014,06,26
219,Good,"We stayed here for two nights and three days in January. The staff were fantastic, they did everything possible to help us organise our stay. We came up from Belfast on the early train and they were able to organise our room to be ready for 9 in the morning, which was fantastic as they couldn't guarantee it so it was a nice surprise. The breakfasts were good and it was nice to be seated. Our room was fairly quiet, you could barely hear the trains passing overhead. It was nice to have wifi in the room although it could be temperamental at times. We booked through trivago, saving a lot of money and getting a brilliant room. When leaving the hotel, we were getting an afternoon train but wanted to enjoy the last dublin had to offer in the morning. We asked reception could they look after our bags for a few hours, which was no problem. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back.",3,2014,06,25
219,Old and newer part,"I stayed in the newer part of the hotel. Facing the railway and the noice from it did not bother me. The room was nice and had enough space to make me feel well (double room, one person). With a small lounge chair, a desk with a chair, an empty fridge and a double cupboard it suited me well. This is 15-20 minutes walk from the most touristic area and 10 minutes from the main shopping street. Across the road there is the Connoly Railway station and 50 meters away you will find the tram.
The front might not look impressive and the walk to the rooms reminds you that this is not new. Still it was nice to stay there. No problems with the cleanliness. The bathroom was fairly small, but I does not stay in that romm more than I need. I would recomend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",4,2014,06,23
219,WAFA World Flower Show 2014,"We booked for the above and wanted to see Dublin properly, so stayed 5 days. Premier suite on top floor has great views at the back of the hotel looking Northwards towards Croake Park stadium and includes use of the premier lounge with very good facilities (entry with key card). The room was very clean, beds were very comfortable and there was no street noise even when out on the balcony.",4,2014,06,23
219,"Excellent location, clean rooms, friendly staff","Especially if you are planning to take the train to other cities in Ireland, including Belfast in Northern Ireland, consider the convenience of this hotel. We stayed here at the beginning of our trip to shake off jet lag for a couple of days and at the end of our trip before departing for the airport. Both times we had clean rooms, enjoyed the easy walk to the center of Dublin and its shopping and sites, as well as being able to walk across the street to the train station. Some of the areas around the hotel are a bit seedy, so we didn't go out walking late at night but we felt very safe and comfortable in the hotel. The beds are super comfortable, and the air conditioning kept the temperature in our room where we wanted it. At one point, we opened a window, but the street noise was too annoying, so we relied on the AC for temperature control.  We would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,06,22
219,bad end to holiday,"Just got back from my  break to galway  and dublin  must say i was very dissapointed in the stay in dublin , i have stayed in the northstar hotel 2 or 3 times ayear for the last eight years loved staying there but not this time  booked a premier room as always normaly on 6th or 7th floor got 5th floor room not up to usual standard toilet was blocked reported it just after i arrived still the same when i left  . The staff where not as helpful or friendly as they where before seem to change all the time will not be booking again",2,2014,06,22
219,Dublin break,We have just returned from a six night trip to Dublin staying at the North Star hotel.The hotel is situated opposite Connelly railway station making it convenient for travel on the Dart along the coast and just a short walk to O'Conner Street.  The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful The room was immaculate and well serviced.  Unfortunately we hit a heat wave and the room was without aircon but a fan was provided. Breakfast was plentiful and meals served in the bar in the evening were good and reasonable.  The concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable also the reception staff. The whole hotel wasextremely clean and well worth a visit.,5,2014,06,22
219,You won't regret the Hotel,"The hotel facing the Connolly station, half a mile distance to the landmark tower Spire, very near to Airport coaches and Luas tram stop. The area may be called as Bus, Coach, Train and Tram junction.
We requested to change our standard room from back to the front building. Unfortunately the old front building has no air condition then the room is being too warm. We did not prefer such a change. Safe, iron board, tea/coffee machine are standards in the room. You have to ring the bell to enter the hotel after midnight for the safety. There are few doors you can only open by plastic card for safety again to get to the room even in the day time. Safety is strict. Full ƒ∞rish breakfast contains many choices, hot and cold. Finding seat at the basement breakfast room is so easy. There are fitness, meeting rooms, premier suites too. Staff were warm and friendly. ƒ∞rish people is incredibly warm and helpful too though they are northern people. The manager lady is always on duty scrutinizing the hotel. We have stayed five nights, enjoyed well. Price/service ratio of the Hotel is reasonable. ƒ∞reland and their folks really mesmerized us. We have had heard of praises of Dublin from magazine journalist Mr. Er√ßeting√∂z in Turkey and wanted to see this country very much. That was the reason we were in Dublin. Don't miss ƒ∞rish stew, the Temple Bar, Guinness beer, ƒ∞rish coffee and whisky.",4,2014,06,20
219,Pleasant end to a Lovely visit to Ireland,"Our CIETOUR booked us all in to this hotel the night before transportation to Dublin Airport. Room was clean and well equipped but WARM. The evening manager was most gracious about our concern about breakfast.  Our taxi was booked before to arrive before the dining room opened.  She assured us we would be accommodated.  In reality,  in the AM, it took some questions to various staff  to accomplish this, BUT eat we did.
Pub food was geeat and service even better.",4,2014,06,18
219,Take it for one reason: Quality of the beds!,"The hotel is well located - except for being bank opposite the railway station which does cause a bit of noise. It is within walking distance of the shopping and tourist district. 

However the USP of the hotel is one: extremely comfortable beds. The beds are by far the best I have slept in over a decade of business/leisure travel. I didn't think other reviewers would comment on this but clearly people have noticed this aspect which means other experiences also reflect this fact. Also, the rooms are tastefully done and cheery.

I would definitely recommend this hotel - do stay here if you want to sleep like a baby!",5,2014,06,18
219,Nice place.,"This hotel is small enough to feel like a local spot. Location is convenient to the train station (across the street), and there is some shopping nearby - mostly little grocery and convenience stores. We were on the 2nd floor and it was noisy, especially after games let out, plus the train tracks run close to the hotel at one spot. AC was nice though! Internet access is s-l-o-w in the rooms, better in the lobby, but still if a lot of people are online at the same time ... you'll wait forever to get a signal. Hotel staff is very nice. I had gotten sick one of the days, and they were very helpful to my daughter who was worried about me. They told her to bring me tea, which she did and it was lovely. And then I went down to dinner with her that night and just had a bowl of mashed potatoes, which were really very good. Everyone in the dining room, including some of the customers, asked me how I was feeling! We had a ""Family Room"" which was pleasantly large. Beds were comfy, rooms were clean, huge deep bathtub! Don't know that I would walk around that neighborhood after dark, but that might just be me.",3,2014,06,18
219,"Fantastic stay, really comfortable room","We had a great stay this weekend. The room was great, really comfortable beds and was lovely and spacious and the balcony a great asset to enjoy! All staff were really helpful and great service was received. The restaurant and bar was very good and excellent friendly service, nothing was too much trouble.  ",4,2014,06,17
219,"Excellent Location, Good Food and quiet sleep!","Despite being in a noisy area the rooms are very quiet and clean too... no mini-bar in my room though.
Dinner at the hotel pub was great.. average price and good food... loved the chicken wings :)
All the people that I have met are nice and helpful and it makes you feel good. They do really care of their customers! :)
Location is great for any purpose. City tram and many buses pass in front of the hotel and trains as well as it is located in front of Connolly Station and beside Busaras (Coach Station).
5 Minutes walking to the Spire.
The breakfast included was ""continental"" but you can also get the upgrade to the ""full Irish""...
:)",4,2014,06,17
219,Fantastic stay!,"I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely this hotel is! My personal experience of city hotels is that you have to pay quite a lot of money to get a decent hotel, however this hotel was decently priced and had a lovely interior. I also did not realise how big our room was until we arrived, as there was a separate extra room adjoined to our room which had a tea and coffee maker with a dressing table. The man at reception was extremely polite and breakfast was fantastic (and included in our stay!). The hotel is only a short walking distance from the bus station which was handy, as well as a short walk to temple bar area. I would definitely stay at this hotel the next time I'm in Dublin and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,06,17
219,Lovely Hotel in Dublin,"My best friend and I staid here at the beginning and the end of our tour of Ireland. The first stay was very good. The view was horrid, but we're in a city... 
There was air conditioning in the room because the windows didn't open in that particular room. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the rooms very clean. 
Our second stay in the North Star was... warm. Be aware some rooms do not have a/c because they really don't need them. They supply fans and the windows open to let in a breeze. 
The staff is very nice and I totally recommend this hotel. 

Also, I don't know how the in-house restaurant is, but please go eat brunch at Graingers on the corner of Talbot right by the hotel.",4,2014,06,12
219,Star Quality,"Spent a night here recently while experiencing Dolly Parton. Great hotel in a convenient location close to Connolly Station and Luas Stop with easy access to nearby major Theatres and Shows. Very nice hotel with exceptionally clean rooms and great front office and bar staff. A special mention for Paul in the Bar/Restaurant, very friendly and super efficient. Breakfast room a bit out of reach, no windows and staff could be a little brighter. Bedroom was well kitted out and exceptionally clean. Only downside was we needed to have the window open for air but nearby air-conditioning equipment caused some irritating noise interrupting sleep. (Ok, it was at a budget price and someone has to draw the short straw, but staff should have warned about noise and provided earmuffs.) Overall, highly recommended.",5,2014,06,12
219,VERY GOOD - PERFECT AREA,"We booked 2 double rooms for 5 nights without breakfast, so I can't comment on the latter. Our room was very good and well equipped, clean and with coffee and tea preparing machine. The only disadvantage: our room was located on ground level and consequently the windows were barred. The staff were very friendly and helpful while we were also very pleased with the restaurant. 
 The hotel is well situated, just opposite to the Connoly Railway Station and the Busaras bus station. There are plenty of bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants nearby",4,2014,06,08
219,Not up to scratch,"I stayed here for the eagles concert and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. The toilet in our room didn't flush properly , it was a small arm wrestle to get it to drain. My biggest gripe was the service in the bar! As a person who works in the hospitality industry management position, I would be embarrassed to see my staff work the way these guys were! I sat at the bar and said hi to the barman who didn't even acknowkledge my presence! I then sat for a further 15 minutes as he made other drinks. At this point 3 other gentlemen joined the bar and he proceeded to serve them and left me sitting there! Shocking service! When I went for breakfast the next morning I had been told that my room had been in for breakfast when we hadnt... God knows who helped themselves to my breakfast! ",2,2014,06,06
219,Concert Stay,Stayed for 1 night while in Dublin for Eagles concert. Had booked a single room but was given a family room 2 single beds and a double so no worries about space Room was spotless and beds very comfortable . I can understand some peoples concerns about the area it does seen a bit dodgy but for handiness to the O2 Arena I would stay again.,4,2014,06,05
219,Not As Advertised at all!!,Showed up to check in after our train around 5 to 10pm. 5 min til the kitchen closed and they wouldn't serve us. we get into our room. So hot. AC doesn't work. Asked them to send someone to fix it they didn't because we were sweating all night.  Found local pizza around the corner. Good place. Will never plan to stay again. Will be reporting our review to the vacation business we booked with. They could care less too. Staff was not that friendly. Worst place on our trip. ,1,2014,06,04
219,great hotel,"stayed here on sat to see a show in the 02. After reading some reviews on here i was a bit nervous about staying here but to my delight i had the complete opposite stay to some people. we arrived early around 10:30 and were greated by a lovely receptionist who was training (and doing a wonderful job) We were lucky enough that a room was ready and we were checked in right away. We got to the room and it was lovely. Clean, bright very spacious. The only down side was the train ran right beside the room so if you didnt want any1 looking in you had to keep the blinds closed. You could also hear the trains during the day but not at night which was a bonus so dont let it put you off. Sat was very warm and the heat in the room was rediculious but a quick stop at reception and we got a fan for the room.... problem solved :) We opted for breakfast in our room and i dont have a single bad word to say about it. Delisous and realli set us up for the day. The hotel will also hold your bags for you after check out which again is a bonus. All in all i would recomend this hotel. All the staff we encountered were lovely and the room was perfect. we will be back..... Thank you :)",4,2014,06,03
219,Room for improvement,"Stayed a week at this hotel while on ""holiday"" in Ireland. There were some positives and negatives to comment on. The price was reasonable and it was convenient to Connolly station which we used for several day trips out of Dublin. I can understand, however, why many commenters felt the area around the hotel was 'sketchy'. While I never felt unsafe at any point, it did seem to be on the somewhat 'rough end' of town. The staff were all friendly but as other commenters have noted, it's FAR from the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in. If quiet is important to you, I'd probably look elsewhere. Also, the wifi in the rooms is basically non-existent and you need to go into the lobby to get a signal. They also advertise a sauna but of course, it was broken during our stay. The room itself was nice and the bed super comfortable but some of the other issues-- noise, location, etc would probably prevent me from staying here again. Also, this is a minor thing but became an annoyance-- every single day our room keys would 'demagnetize' and we had to go back to the front desk for new ones. Drove us nuts by the end!!  lol",3,2014,06,02
219,Lovely room but noisy & stuffy,"Lovely spacious room & bathroom with modern decor but we were on the front of the hotel above a busy main road, which was very noisy most of each night, also the room was very warm and stuffy with the window only able to open a few inches. the breakfast was good but we didin't much like the room - again stuffy with no windows or natural light.",3,2014,06,01
219,Lovely hotel,Had very pleasant stay here. The airport transfer was a very useful service. Lovely breakfast too. The room was very comfortable and we were able to check in early. Would recommend to anyone staying in Dublin for the first time. Close to the centre and a Luas stop. ,5,2014,05,31
219,"Great, easy experiance","This is a great and friendly hotel in the heart of Dublin. We booked on a trip package, so thought it may be just a basic hotel. I was pleased to say I was wrong. The room was a large space, very comfy bed, nice service, beautiful restaurant. There are only 2 negatives to the hotel. Firstly the shower is not made for anyone over 5""6, and is very short. Being 6"" tall I had to crouch to get my head under. The second negative was that our room was very close to the train track, and we got a wake up call each morning at 6am. Although the room had double glazing windows, it was very warm so had no choice but to keep the window open. Overall a great experience in a beautiful city",4,2014,05,30
219,Stayed here for a week,The accommodations were nice. I didn't have the issues with noise from the trains. I was on the second floor directly across from the station. There is a convince store of the street to buy water and snacks. The hotel is also a 15 minute walk from Trinity College. The breakfast at this hotel is the best I have had in Ireland. The chocolate croissants were wonderful and there was a great selection of juices. I would stay here again.,4,2014,05,30
219,great hotel!,"The hotel is clean, a short walk to the main attractions, public transportation directly across the street, friendly staff. Breakfast was a little expensive for all you got. Bar/restaurant in the hotel is nice and friendly as well.",5,2014,05,30
219,Beautiful over than the noises of trains!,"A beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin. Attractions are easily accessible from this hotel. Breakfast is great and the hotel price was extremely reasonable. Room was lovely. However, every 10 minutes a train would go past the hotel. It literally felt like it was travelling OVER our room and not alongside of it. After the first night we got used to it, it became quite comforting(!), but the first night we had a terrible sleep hearing the trains every few minutes.",4,2014,05,29
219,still in the center of Dublin,"this hotel is not the largest one that we have stayed in but ranks at the tops for service, cleanliness and a feeling of a homelike atmosphere. it is very well located near the train station. in Europe that is a definite plus. our stay here was the result of the wonderful planning of Rail Tours Ireland. we woke the last day of our tour and it seemed like minutes and we were on our way to Northern Ireland. there is so many good things to say about this trip and I will save that for another time.

P>S I cannot get your awards page. I get a security alert",5,2014,05,29
219,Regretting my stay already!,We are currently staying at the North Star hotel and after our 1st night I am already regretting my decision to stay at this hotel and seriously considering booking elsewhere for the next 2 nights! On arriving we were greeted by a receptionist who wasn't helpful at all and simply said 'come back at 2' and then walked away into a back room! Spoke to a 2nd receptionist who was a little more helpful and at least told us we could leave our bags until we could check in! When we finally checked in we were given a small and very dark and dingy room on the 1st floor with a lovely view of railings and people constantly walking past. So if the room isn't dark enough we now have to keep the curtains shut! Shower is shocking and it's a choice of scolding hot or freezing cold and as for wifi...what wifi! And to top it all off being woken by drilling and steam rollers directly outside our room was not what I'd planned for our anniversary getaway. I did speak to a receptionist about my concerns last night and she wasn't interested in helping us other than offering to send someone to look at the shower..which never happened!! I'm very upset as I did lots of research into lots of hotels in Dublin mainly through reviews on trip advisor and now I wished I'd booked elsewhere!!,2,2014,05,29
219,Very Clean,"We enjoyed our stay on our honeymoon.  The staff was friendly, the hotel was very clean, and the room was spacious.  The Premier Club was a nice room with a view.  The only problem we really had was that the coffee/hot chocolate machine was out of service 6 of the 9 days we were there.  Continental breakfast was typically standard, we never sprung for the full Irish breakfast.  The bathroom in the room was top of the line.   There was a gym that we never used, but it did look more spacious and functional that most hotel gyms.",4,2014,05,27
219,Overnight stay,"We stayed in the hotel overnight for a concert at Croke Park. We stayed in the new part of the hotel in a family room. Rooms were spotless and beds were very comfortable. Food was very good, both at dinner and breakfast. Staff were very pleasant, welcoming and helpful, especially the hotel manager and Deirdre, a waitress in the restaurant who couldn't do enough for us. The hotel is in a good location for concerts at Croke Park -15 mins walk away. The only downside was the hotel parking. We arrived and the gateway to the car park was backed up with cars. After waiting in the 'no parking' street, we gave up and parked in the Connolly Station car park -‚Ç¨9 for 24 hours. (5 mins walk from hotel)

On the whole, we had a very nice stay in the hotel and would recommend it :-) hopefully will be back again soon.",4,2014,05,27
219,Great Hotel in Excellent Location,"Booked this for a concert that we were going to in Croke Park.  Firstly the bus station is only about 4 mins walk away which was really handy.  The train station is opposite the hotel.  Croke park itself was less than 10 mins walk.  The hotel was really busy because of the concerts but staff remained polite and friendly and were very helpful.  Rooms are exactly as shown on their website, they are bright, clean and spacious.  Had dinner in the restaurant and the food was perfect.  Also had breakfast there and their was so much choice, hot food was lovely and their was plenty.  Loved this hotel and the location and will be going back!",5,2014,05,27
219,Great Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel just after Christmas time, it was about a 10 minute walk into city centre or the luas was just basically across the way.  Staff were friendly.   The room was really nice and clean and so was the bathroom I wasn't expecting such a high standard and the room was pretty big too.   We stayed on the 1st floor, when we got into the room during the day there was music playing and we thought it was the people next door but we didn't mind cause it was during the day and we were heading out anyway.  When we got back that night the music was still going but we soon found out it was cause are room was above the bar downstairs.  It came to 12am and we rang down asking about the music they said they would turn it down but they never, but they did eventually turn it off at 12.20am.   The breakfast was included with our price which was good and the breakfast was nice.   I would gladly come back to this hotel again, great location, nice staff, big rooms and clean rooms, great breakfast.  It's worth the money!",4,2014,05,26
219,Spotless,"When you enter the hotel it becomes apparent that it was very clean and friendly.
But I think most Dubliners are friendly, it comes across as a friendly city, that may be why it's so busy.
Bed was comfortable had a good nights sleep, tea facilities if required, iron and ironing board, free safe and toiletries.
Breakfast was more than adequate something to suit everyone and set you up for the day.
Would certainly return to the hotel as well as recommend it",5,2014,05,26
219,Newly renovated Hotel in a very good position,"This is the perfect Hotel for a City Trip! The complete Hotel is renewed and all rooms are in warm colors. You can walk to every sight, also to the temple district. 
Restaurants and bars are just around the corner",4,2014,05,26
219,Excellent accommodation,"I would like to add my comments to those included in my colleague Paul Smith's recent review to say that I very much enjoyed my stay.   I was a member of the party mentioned and certainly echo the comments that we were well looked after the during the whole time of our stay and the accommodation was excellent.

A special thank you to Linda McNeice for making the arrangements in the first place in conjunction with Paul.

Brian Boddy",4,2014,05,26
219,Always a great stay!,"I have stayed here on a number of occasions and ive never found fault with it. The staff are always so helpful and polite to deal with, in particular the bar men who are probably the friendliest I've ever come across! Great location only minutes away from O'Connell street. Hotel itself is beautiful, with spacious rooms, ridiculously comfy beds and brilliantly clean bathrooms. Definitely will continue to stay in future.",5,2014,05,26
219,Amazing!!!,Everything was brilliant. Staff very friendly especially in the bar/restaurant. Couldn't have done enough for us especially the children. Food was amazing. Will definitely stay again. Can't wait to come back.,5,2014,05,26
219,An excellent start to our wonderful two week vacation!,"North Star is well-located in the heart of Dublin, allowing us to see much of the city by foot! The hotel staff is very accomodating and even allowed us to check in early! If I ever get lucky enough to come back to this beautiful country, I would stay here again!",5,2014,05,26
219,greate service,"me and my sister had a super weekend in Dublin. The staff at North Star Hotel was really nice and helpful. if we ever return to Dublin, we will book this hotel again. The rooms was good for the price and we also enjoyed the breakfast.",4,2014,05,25
219,close to everything,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Very friendly staff! The hotel is only a 5-10 minute walk to the centre. Our room was situated in the old part of the hotel, which is noisy at night (Street) Considering the good deal for the room, I can‚Äôt complain about the noise, but I think you should know this if you book a cheaper room.",4,2014,05,25
219,Extremely friendly,"We had asked for early check in time, as the hotel was very busy it was not possible. The staff went outof their way to accomodate us. Clare? From housekeeping was really good, as were the reception staff. Great price through the hotel for taxi to airport. Great stay highly recommended.",5,2014,05,25
219,Birthday/Anniversary Celebration,"We stayed here 22/05/14 for 2 nights. From arrival to departure the staff made us feel very welcome ,so polite , friendly and especially helpful. McGettitgans bar staff were exceptional in their service. The only complaint we have is that the room at night was very warm and uncomfortable at times even with the air-con on. However this will not deter us from returning there and already have plans to return later in the year and will recommend highly to friends and family",5,2014,05,25
219,Beautiful,Well worth a stay ..friendly staff... Beautiful room..great location.. If you want to see all around Dublin this hotel is in a perfect location. Fantastic stay in dublin.... North star is in a great location for Oconnell street,5,2014,05,25
219,Convenience and comfort,"I've stayed at North Star Hotel & Premier Club Suites several times now. I live in Limerick City but fly from Dublin twice a year to visit family in the U.S. I stay at North Star the night before departure and also stay there on the day I arrive back in Ireland. The location only a few minutes from Busaras and the airport shuttle service are the main reasons that I prefer North Star Hotel, but I also like the comfortable rooms. I like being able to control the heat or A/C, which I don't find in some hotels in Ireland. The bathrooms are always super clean. It's less than 10 minutes walk to O'Connell Street. Staff are always courteous and helpful.",5,2014,05,25
219,Overnight stay for 1 Direction concert,"Stayed here for the 1 Direction concert on Friday 23 May. Very convenient for us as we got the train down to Dublin and the station is just across the road.  Arrived at the hotel earlier than our check in but we where able to leave our bags at the desk, so we could go shopping.  The girls at the reception where lovely and spoke to my niece about the concert.  When we returned to the hotel it was very busy because of the concert, but the waiting time for our room key was quick and again the staff where very friendly. The room was a triple it was very big, the beds where clean and comfortable.  We had breakfast included in our stay the following morning which was lovely and there was plenty of it from cereal, cooked breakfast (sausages,bacon etc), fresh fruit salad, mini Danish pastry and toast.  We checked out but again left our bags at reception while we went to the zoo.  When we came back to the hotel we had lunch in the bar and we had steak and chips which where very nice and very well priced. Great stay will definitely be back.",5,2014,05,25
219,Overnight stay for concert at O2,"Stayed here in March for a concert at the o2. We got a good deal - ¬£50 for the room including breakfast! Close to Busaras and across the road from Connolly train station. 

The receptionist was friendly and we were given a room on the second floor. You do have to walk up a flight of stairs before coming to the lift as the hotel is built under like a railway bridge. The building itself had a lot of character. The room that we got was ok, but forthe price we paid, i didn't expect much. 

The breakfast room is in the basement and there was a good variety. Staff were friendly and courteous during our stay. I really like the outdoor area beside the bar which hadheated lamps and was nicely decorated. I would stay again if getting a good deal!",3,2014,05,24
219,"Easy, convenient and great hospitality","I arrived a little earlier than checkin, no problem I was immediately offered a room with a complimentary upgrade.  Met by warm, enthusiastic and helpful checkin staff, particularly Mariana.  Abundantly helpful, good value and an excellent restaurant next door, McGettigan's Cookhouse.  The room was comfortable and the facilities very well matched.  Will come back. ",4,2014,05,23
219,Amazing!,"Love this hotel, staff where friendly the moment we arrived. We where given a free room upgrade to the premier suite over looking the city of Dublin. 
Would stay here again. Fantastic hotel and restaurant. ",5,2014,05,22
219,A lot of potential ,The North star hotel is a great looking period georgian building. However the layout of the hotel is rather peculiar. Having to walk up and down stairs to get to a lift and vice versa. The room was kept clean however the bedding wasn't changed in 3 days. Also I do understand that the television volume should be limited but not to the extent of what we experienced. We stayed in room 157. This was probably the worst positioned room within the building along with the one opposite. This was due to being situated next to two different entry doors which fiercely slammed every time somebody walked through. ,3,2014,05,22
219,THE NORTH STAR HOTEL,"We stayed at the north star hotel for one night. It was ideal as wdew were going go The O2. The room was comfortable and immaculate. The bathroom was warm. Breakfast was ok but not the worst we had. But unfortunately, when my girlfriend was on her way to take a bath, the water was emptying as the plug wasn't keeping the water in. My girlfriend was slighly peed off with that.",3,2014,05,21
219,"North Star Hotel, Dublin, Ireland","Room was like having a bowling alley above every time a train went by & room shook.  Left a ring in room and when we returned we were told it had not been turned in but it has to be on the finger of the housekeeper. Second room we were told was a ""suite"" well it was a room for a wheelchair patron.  Although I have no idea how a person in a wheelchair could use this facility. Lift is up a whole flight of steps. Don't try to check in any earlier than their check in or you will be rudely told they have no rooms available.",1,2014,05,20
219,dublin break,Well appointed room and friendly staff. Food in the grill restaurant was excellent. The location was a little too far from the shopping areas to go on foot but hop on bus stopped outside the Hotel. We would definitely go back again.,4,2014,05,20
219,"Some rooms are a 5, others not so good","We loved the location of the North Star Hotel, except for the rail tracks which were overhead, tracks, about the level of a second floor room, where we were. Very noisy, as the rails are busy, even at night. We were to return in a week or so after touring other parts of Ireland and asked for a quieter room. The manager upgraded us to a room away from the rails and we were very happy. The staff is excellent. We would return, with the caveat that it's best to be careful about room location.",3,2014,05,20
219,good hotel,"tha room was clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay.  The restaurant was nice the food was good and prices were not too bad.  the breakfast buffet in the morning was well stocked and was staffed well.  overall we enjoyed our one night stay and we might stay the again in the future.",5,2014,05,19
219,Wonderful in every respect...,"This is the seventh time I have stayed at the North Star, and I would not choose anywhere else to stay in Dublin. On this occasion, I also made special arrangements with the hotel to accommodate a dozen friends from a club to which we all belong, as we were having a special visit to the city. Without exception, they were all very impressed with their stay at the North Star, and have said that they would choose the hotel for any future visit to Dublin. 

Room quality and cleanliness and housekeeping were all very good, and the breakfast exceptional - the staff also trying to ensure that our party were seated adjacently. Reception staff and Kieran, the concierge were all extremely helpful and I should like to give a special mention to Linda McNeice for her attention to the needs of the group and especially with the arrangements for the Friday night gathering that we had in McGettigan's Cookhouse.  Here, the staff did everything possible to make our evening memorable, and service and attention to detail was impeccable. The food was also first rate.

Excellent in every respect, this was a stay to remember for a long, long time. Thank you so much!",5,2014,05,19
219,Beautiful Hotel,We visited Dublin and we stayed ad North Star Hotel... I strongly recommed you this hotel. And Dublin suprised me very well. The hotel's staff was very kind and they helpel us to discover the most interesting places of Dublin.,5,2014,05,19
219,great value!,"Rooms were clean and neat, staff was exceptionally helpful! Very convenient location.  We did have dinner at the hotel on our first night and while the restaurant was inviting the food was just edible.",5,2014,05,18
219,"Staff very friendly and helpful, excellent service.","Area not great but closeness to Dublin City centre a great bonus,
Would certainly like to come again, the rooms were beautifully decorated with good facilities and the staff were friendly and very helpful.",5,2014,05,18
219,Good hotel,"We have just returned from 2 nights at the North Star, the room was clean and comfy, with tea and coffee making facilities. We were close to the railway line but only noticed the train noise early morning, (about 6.30ish), but this was not an issue as we were there to explore Dublin not for long lie ins. All the staff we met were lovely and very helpful, the restaurant was good and the food was excellent. Yes it is a little in the wrong area but it's only a short walk to O'Connell Street, and though the side streets are a bit run down you actually got less hassle from the beggars than you do on the main streets! All of the main areas of Dublin seem to be overrun by beggars which is a shame as it is a lovely city.",4,2014,05,15
219,Redeemed itself in the end!!,"My partner and I have just come back from a trip away in Dublin. We stayed at the northstar hotel. The location was not very good I would class it as 'the wrong end of town'. We got given a room right under the railway line and as you can imagine,  the noise was horrendous and also shook the room every 20 mins or so. Also the taxis line up across the street so u hear honking of horns all night. We were very deflated as we were looking forward to thid break. Anyway the nxt morning my partner spoke to a manager who I must say was very accommodating and understanding,  he automatically offered us a premier suite located at the rear of hotel which was beautiful and much more fitting of the four star that the hotel boasts. I must say the service is fantastic staff helpful and the breakfast each morning was spot on.  The location is the only issue it is in the rougher part of town a few beggars hovering and druggies around (But the whole city has this issue) But overall I was happy and enjoyed the rest of our stay :)",3,2014,05,14
219,Good location at the right price,"Some people are slightly wary of staying ""north of the river"" but we had a great stay at the North Star. Within walking distance of O'Connell street to get to the Temple Bar area, and directly across from the Connolly station. The Airport shuttle was a nice perk too - we took it to and from the airport in under 30 minutes! I had emailed ahead asking for some extra pillows in the room and they were there when we checked in.  My only complaint was that our TV was terrible - not that we spent that much time watching it but even to watch a bit before going to bed was not very enjoyable (horrid picture, and really old!) If you are looking for some pubs very close by we enjoyed the Celt a few times and O'Sheas.

We had a few drinks in the Lounge too - Paddy was a great character! Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2014,05,13
219,"Fantastic service, comfy beds","We booked the north Star hotel through a special offer on Wowcher. We were very impressed from the moment we arrived, the location was prefect being across the road from Connolly Station and Luas and only a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar and Grafton Street. 

We arrived early and were able to check in and were even upgraded to a Premier Suite. The breakfast every day was good quality with a good selection of hot a cold food. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, we did not try the restaurant for lunch and dinner and felt we should have after walking through there one evening. 

Would definately go back.",5,2014,05,12
219,Good stay,"I found a good internet rate due to staying for 5 nights so I was already pleased with the price. My first impression of the area was a little 'iffy' but I had no problems. However, I'm not sure how much I would walk around that particular area by myself at night. 
The location is fantastic - not directly close to anything, but everything is within walking distance.
The hotel itself was fine, the rooms fine/basic, the bed and pillows were ok but not great.
Staff was nice and accommodating. I had arrived early in the am (around 1030) just expecting to drop off my bags and come back later in the day to check in, however a pleasant surprise was that my room was ready so I got to take care of that right away which was nice.
The airport shuttle is convenient and only 5 euro, but check ahead with the staff on the shuttle times as it is not overly frequent.",4,2014,05,11
219,Very bad staff,"Would never stay at this hotel again!! Staff were so rude!! Price of the drink was disgracful, food was over priced and wasn't the best tasting. I walked out side the hotel to find two homeless people fighting, around the corner there was where 3 men dealing drugs, the lane where my room was facing had people sitting out side it drinkin, signing and fighting all night. 

So overly priced, they show you lovely rooms on the site but give you old fashioned smelly rooms. My friend had a room out the front and side the noise of the trains where very loud and the traffic also.",2,2014,05,09
219,Definitely return to this Hotel,"We spent three nights in this Hotel. Everywhere is very clean, good choice for breakfast, but food not kept hot. Staff all very helpful and pleasant. Rooms spacious with comfortable beds. Would definitely return.",4,2014,05,08
219,"beautiful entry, friendly staff","the reception area is beautiful and the staff was wonderful!  I have heard that the ""new"" part is great, but our ""family"" bedroom was in the old section and not great, could be worse but could be much better.  the train station was across the street and we could hear the trains coming and going.  the beds were not comfortable.  the location was fine- about a 10-15 minute walk to the Liffey and edge of Temple Bar and we were comfortable walking to and from the hotel to sights and areas of Dublin.  The breakfast was great.  I think we would have been happy in the new section, but were not thrilled with our room- but everything else was great and the location was manageable to where we wanted to go.",3,2014,05,07
219,Great hotel,Stayed 2 nights and had emailed before arrival and informed the reservation desk that it was our wedding anniversary and we wanted to request a high floor room. There are 7 floors at the hotel. I got a return email saying that a nice room on a higher floor was reserved for us. We got a room on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel and even with the window closed we could still hear the trains and people talking. However the trains stopped around 12. There was a residents lounge on the 2nd floor which was well furnished but there was no tv. The room was very hot however it did have air conditioning. The car park was beside the hotel and we could look down at our car every time we went out. The beds were clean as were everything else and they were very comfortable. We did not have a fridge I  our room but we had tea and coffee facilities. Also hairdryer safe iron and ironing board. The breakfast was very good. The location was great but I would not have liked to have been walking back to the hotel in my own late at night. We would return to this hotel again,4,2014,05,05
219,A nice surprise,"A last minute booking at to be fair I hadn't expected the hotel to be up to much (didn't have to be for what I had in mind).
On arrival I was pleased to find that parking was available and that it was only 8euro a night. Very reasonable; and valet parked too! :)

The decor was nice and fresh on entry, and our room was nice and clean and reasonably decorated.

The staff were helpful and friendly, with a quick response to a request.

The food (lunch only) was lovely and it was a pity we'd already booked a table elsewhere for dinner as I could easily have ate there again that evening.",4,2014,05,03
219,Excellent Hotel in Dublin,"For those who don't look to spend time inside the expensive halls and reception rooms and hit the town instead and enjoy your day outdoors, and yet still stay in pretty luxurious room with conditioned air on demand, private bathroom, wardrobe and even a small refrigerator to keep a few things cool, great amenities in all, the North Star Hotel on Amiens Street is the the best choice that I would select without a doubt on my return trip to Dublin. Situated right across the street from Dublin Connolly train station that links Republic with the Northen Ireland as well as DART ‚Äì the suburban train system, LUAS red line tram that connects east and west Dublin and the Bus√°ras (Bus √âireann) bus station to take you anywhere including the airport., are the options The hotel also provide a shuttle to take you to the airport for 5 Euros. Check for the time schedule with  the front desk clerk. The hotel staff is extremely friendly. Of course! It's Ireland!

As mentioned, the location is near to excellent! A 12-minute light stroll will take you to the Temple Bar and just about any site one would like to see is within a ten minute mark. For a one who's a good on feet can cross entire town to the west side in 25 minutes where Gunness Brewery dominates several city blocks near Heuston train station that connects Republic's west and south cities and counties.
 
The usual check in time in Europe is 14:00 hours (2:00 PM) and sometimes your room maybe available earlier. Shall you arrive prior check-in time, the front desk will store your luggage so you can freely walk away and start enjoying the city. Come back whenever you please. Just let the staff know and they'll be happy to oblige. We arrived at the hotel at seven in the morning when the entire city is still asleep. Too far from even asking for our room. So we left our bags at the hotel, spent all day roaming Dublin and returned to our room in the evening. It was that simple.

Shall you cut your first day short and relax in the evening at the hotel, then there's a choice of two restaurants and a bar on the ground floor, cozy environment, great food (fairly priced for a hotel), and it can be delivered to your room if you'd wish (no extra charge was involved while we were staying there in April 2014). The bar/restaurant has a handful of brews on tap including rare Caledonia, a super smooth triple hop Scottish ale. Food cooked fresh of course! Very friendly staff, high tables and a Beer Garden patio in the back to enjoy fresh air when it isn't raining. Connect with the world with a free WiFi provided and enjoy your stay.

I give this Dublin newest 4-star hotel the FIVE FULL STARS according to my own experience traveling the Europe and the variety of hotels I have pleasure to stay in the past. 
Those ones that usually I keep returning back to over and over again. And so I hope, will you.
Happy trails! Bon voyage! Go n-√©ir√≠ an b√≥thar libh agus c√©ad m√≠le f√°ilte!

219,Dublin city,"Stayed here for 3 nights over Easter, lovely atmosphere, Resturant/bar. Clean, bright rooms. In a great position to explore Dublin and for transport to and from Dublin airport. Would highly recommend and would definatly return!",4,2014,05,02
219,Dublin Trip,"Stayed at this hotel 23rd to 26th April 2014. The hotel was in a good location within walking distance of shops bars and restaurants. We booked a twin room but got a room with a double bed and single bed, the room was large and spacious, lovely decor and nice and warm with a comfy bed, the room was kept spotless. Staff were all very polite and helpful.
Had a meal in the restaurant one night and prices were on par with outside restaurants. Breakfast was excellent every morning where staff were very efficient.
Would recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again.",4,2014,04,30
219,"Very nice, good location","Staff was very kind, and hotel is in a great location (near the LUAS rail station and by Connolly train station)-- An easy 10 min walk across the Liffey to the Temple Bar area and other attractions.  The room was a little small, but you don't need your room for anything besides sleep; enjoy the city!",4,2014,04,28
219,"What a lovely, clean hotel.",This was booked off a groupon deal and what a deal it was. Lovely clean hotel great location. Bit worried about the tram line outside my bedroom window but was not a problem. Easy stroll into temple bar. Rooms very clean and spacious. Bit of a maze but you get used to it. Bar prices no different than local bars. Def recommend this hotel. Would prefer this than staying in temple bar.,5,2014,04,27
219,"Location.Location,Location","Stayed here on numerous occasions over the years, now under new ownership/management. Has been refurbished to a high standard. Convenient to Rail/Bus connections throughout Ireland--perhaps too close to DART rail system. Excellent value, good accommodation, would not stay anywhere else.",5,2014,04,27
219,A great location,"We stayed at the hotel for four nights this April.  The room was a good size with decent amenities.  The location is excellent as it is close to train/bus routes and is about a ten minute walk to more touristy locations close to the river.  We were in a room by the main road and while there was noise it was never very distracting or too loud.

The only problems we had was that the room was absolutely boiling - even after we turned off the radiators, and the shower was very erratic with changing water temperatures and pressures.

A good breakfast was provided and all at a decent price.",4,2014,04,27
219,A very good hotel with exceptional staff.,"We arrived in Dublin at 5 AM and took a cab directly to the hotel. Although check-in time was 2 PM, the folks at the front desk found us two rooms where we could rest up and shower after an all-night flight. The front desk staff were exceptionally helpful, and the buffet breakfast was very good. The hotel layout is a bit odd, and is comprised of an old building and a new structure. Still, it was quiet, very centrally located directly across from the train station that services Belfast, and within walking distance of the major attractions including the GPO, the Speier, and many restaurants.",4,2014,04,27
219,Great,"My Mother and I stayed here for 2 nights, the room was beautiful. The location is handy if you are arriving by bus to Busaras (only a short 5-10 minute walk) and about the same time to walk to O'Connell Street in the city centre. We also had the opportunity to dine in the restaurant, the portions were generously sized and both mains and desserts were lovely in taste and presentation. We had some difficulties with the wifi cutting in and out but aside from that we really enjoyed our stay and would happily return.",4,2014,04,25
219,Excellent place for a few days near to all attractions,We found the staff very helpful especially reception. We arrived on an early flight and intended to drop off bags but they found us a free room at 9am and let us check in. The room was spacious and all facilities were clean. two little bugbears. Firstly they make a big thing of the free wi-fi but it was not available in the room and we had to go to the small reception area or the restaurant for a connection. Continental breakfast was included in our package. The publsihed price was continental at 8.5 and full Irish at 12.5. However to upgrade was 7.5 Euros which seemed a bit unfair to me.Would definitely stay here again as only a few minutes from O'Connell street and the bus station.,4,2014,04,25
219,"Good Location, Friendly, Recommend","Great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff!! I had to arrange another night's stay after booking through Expedia and they were very prompt in their email reply and accommodated our request with no problems. We were also greeted by wonderful front desk staff and a hilarious concierge ! 

The hotel was located directly across from Connelly train station, which was great for day trips and it was just far enough away from the St. Patricks day action to ensure a good night's sleep. However, if you are looking to stay close to the action, definitely try to get a hotel nearTemple Bar. 

The rooms were immaculate and huge! The bed was by far the most comfortable of any place we stayed in Europe and the King size was an added treat. Breakfast in the morning was also very good and definitely worth the additional cost (if it wasn't already included with the room). 

I would certainly stay here again and would definitely recommend to friends and family!",4,2014,04,24
219,"Good location, excellent breakfast and would definitely stay again.",The hotel is in a brilliant location. Easy to walk into centre or buses trains and taxis on the doorstop. The food was lovely. Staff helpful. Hotel lovely and clean throughout. Although we didn't actually use it the gym looked well equipped. Would definitely stay again and recommend to friends and family. ,4,2014,04,23
219,Warm welcome and very friendly,"Stayed overnight with my two grown-up daughters as we were at a concert at the 02 arena. Location was fantastic, just across from Connelly train station, checked in by a very helpful and friendly male receptionist (sorry don't remember his name) who advised us on the hotel facilities and offered to take our bags to our room. Our room was for three and had two single and one double bed which were spotless and very comfortable. The room looked recently decorated in a very stylish and modern way, complete with tea and coffee facilities, iron and hair dryer. The bathroom was also spotless and again decorated in a modern sleek style. We decided on room service for our meal before heading out for the night which was delivered quickly and professionally and was delicious and came with three glasses of Prosecco! Had a great nights sleep, checked out and left our luggage with receptionist while we headed off for some retail therapy! Returned a few hours later to again a very friendly receptionist who returned our luggage and thanked us for our stay. I have recommended the North Star Hotel to my friends and family and will definitely choose this hotel on my return to Dublin.",5,2014,04,23
219,Lovely hotel!,"So happy with our choice of hotel. The room was lovely, bed was comfy and the staff were very helpful. We had a meal in the hotel restaurant which was very very nice! The hotel is only a short walk from the centre and close to lots of shops. I have no negative comments at all. Will definitely be returning. ",5,2014,04,23
219,satisfied customer,"Everything was great  We were very pleased, the service was great, location is perfect, then we think the food is really good, we longed for breakfast every day Vi rekomenderar detta hotell till alla som bes√∂ker Dublin",5,2014,04,23
219,Great First Impression,"This was the first stop on our tour of Ireland. My best friend and I arrived early and our room wasn't ready yet. We explored around the local area before coming back. They had upgraded our room into a premiere suite. Room was great, very clean. BEDS WERE AMAZING! Seriously, we stayed in 2 other hotels while in Ireland and the North Star beds were by far the best. Hotel breakfast (not included) was delicious. Hotel reception was very helpful when giving us suggestions on what to do and where to eat. Hotel was a bit of a walk (15-20) from Temple Bar, but for a 10 euro cab ride, wasn't too bad. Overall great stay and would definitely come back!",4,2014,04,22
219,good hotel friendly staff great b/f,"stayed here for concert in o2--- hotel first class warm welcome, had booked 4 rooms of which 3 were up graded, all 4 rooms were great. hotel had arranged a shuttle bus to concert very handy although a little pricey. have to say breakfast in the morning was 1st class the best hotel breakfast i have had in a while .over all a great wee hotel worth a try",5,2014,04,22
219,Trains?,The train sound like it is travelling through the centre of the hotel. My room wasn't clean the bed sheets seemed to be dirty??? The staff were nice but be aware you will be charged for parking even if you are a guest. I arrived a 21:00 and left at 06:00 and was still charged 10 euro parking.,3,2014,04,21
219,Good Old Style Dublin Hotel,"Stayed in North Star Hotel for a  concert in the O2....Perfectly located for this, or a match in Croker..both within walking distance. The O2 through Dublins financial district, passing nice pubs.
Rooms were cosy, warm and quiet. Staff were friendly. We had a meal in the bar, and again friendly, local staff...good food and nice atmosphere. Would recommend and would stay again. Car park small, but good price for city centre.......",4,2014,04,21
219,"Good Choice, Great Location, Great People","We stayed here last week Mon-Fri, part of AerLingus vacation package. Room was fine, no problem with noise as other people have said in some reviews. We were in the back, 4th Floor. Room was immaculate, bathroom immaculate, front desk so nice and responsive... restaurant first floor nice to have if you get back late to hotel and don't want to go out again. Very friendly staff. My husband had fish and chips -- very good. Location is great in that all public transportation options are close by;. it is across the street from Connelly Station which is for commuter rail and Irish Rail. So you walk across the street and can get commuter rail to any of the coastal towns north or south.. very quick, trains come all the time, very clean, safe, easy access to the towns. If you want a break from the city. 1/2 hour or less to Howth, D√∫n Laoghaire, Clontarf, and many others as well slightly longer ride. Also, Bus 27 stops there at / near Connelly so easy to get back to hotel. And then you can use the Luas, like a tram around town which is one street away or walk up to O'Connell street about 15 minutes easy walk and busses everwhere including the hop on and hop offs. I got a Leap Card online, you save money and no deposit for the card. Then you can 'top it off' as needed / add money to it across the street at Connelly station. I also got the Freedom Pass for three days and can use it unlimited for Luas, Intercity Busses, Hop on Hop Off.. I think you can get those for shorter times and also possibly for one week. It makes it so easy and no worry about having the change. We felt very safe there... Just not too many going out options right near North Star so either find that before returning or use the restaurant in the hotel. Small '7-11' type market right at the corner next to the hotel.",4,2014,04,21
219,Excellent concierge,"The North Star Hotel was the first and last stop on a six night trip.  We spoke with the concierge the first day there and he recommended we visit Howth, a quaint fishing village 20 minutes from Dublin on the DART.  We didn't feel we had enough time the day we arrived, so we decided we would visit on our return.  We are so glad that we did, it was a wonderful experience.  The views are amazing and the restaurant scene fabulous.  The hotel was nice in itself.  The restaurant and bar were very good for hotel standards.  The only disappointment was the upgrade we took the last night of the trip.  We paid 30 euro and didn't feel that it was worth the price. Basically, we got a king size bed in the same size room, with a tiny balcony.  Otherwise, the stay was lovely.",4,2014,04,20
219,Great location and lovely hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a city break in January. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room was very clean and comfortable.  Despite being right near the train line, didn't hear anything and had a very relaxing stay. The location is brilliant. 

My only criticism was when we accidentally smashed a glass in the bathroom and asked the staff to sweep it up while we were out. When we can back they had swept it up but hadn't done a very good job and here were still large shards of glass on our bathroom floor which obviously wasn't very safe.

I would however definitely stay here again.",4,2014,04,20
219,A Pleasant Stay!,"As students it is not often that we get to stay in a hotel that has been awarded more than two stars. The decor throughout the entire hotel was tastefully done and the room we were given was lovely, bright and above all clean! The breakfast was fairly good, a wide variety of cereals, juices and pastries with the added bonus of being free! The only issue that we had with this hotel was its location, Talbot Street (I think) just next to the hotel was very dirty and a little run-down which didn't give us the best first impression, however, we were within walking distance of all of the tourist attractions and the bus shuttle from the airport had a stop very close to the hotel which was very convenient. Overall we had a really pleasant stay at the North Star Hotel!",4,2014,04,20
219,Outstanding stay with outstanding service,"I took my partner to Dublin for his christmas present to see Miranda at the Dublin O2. 
The North Star hotel came up on Last Minute . Com as a mystery hotel. I took a chance and booked and am very pleased to say it was simply Devine. Staff were so accommodating and pleasant and the rooms and general update were of top class standard. 
Very much recommended ",5,2014,04,20
219,Irish holiday,Great experience.  Only compliant is not very handicap accessible. Friendly staff. Within walking distance of everything perfect for sight seeing. Excellent food in the restaurant and fast service. Would definitely come back.,5,2014,04,19
219,Excellent,Excellent hotel. We arrive at around 8.30am and went to the hotel to leave our luggage and were delighted when we were told our room was already available! Rooms are a good size and lovely and clean. We didn't have enough towels so went to reception on our way out and more towels were in our room when we got back. The bar was lovely and had some really nice cocktails on offer and the food was also really nice too. It is in an excellent location. You can walk into Dublin city centre in about 5 minutes and even into the temple bar area. We got a taxi there and it cost around 7-10 euros depending on the time. Would definitely stay again! ,5,2014,04,18
219,Amazing Hotel in the heart of a Beautiful City,"This was mine and my girlfriends first trip to Dublin and this hotel was an incredible base for everything we wanted to do. Oddly enough we got to the door of the hotel and felt we were in the wrong place, as the hotel looks so ornate and regal in comparison to what we actually paid. The staff were very friendly and helpful, there was a hotel joining to the hotel with delicious food and even a gym included which we were unable to use, unfortunately. The location of the hotel is a few short minutes from Dublin's main street and across the road from Connolly Station, meaning transport was never an issue. They were even able to arrange transport back to the airport when we left. Fantastic place and would definitely stay there again when I return to Dublin.",5,2014,04,18
219,"Lovely rooms, great location & friendly staff","I have just spent 2 nights at this hotel with my daughter. The hotel is across the road from Connolly Station & up the street from Busaras. It is a 5-10 minute walk from O'Connell Street. 
We were in room 109. The room was spacious, tastefully decorated & spotlessly clean. 
The staff were very friendly & helpful. We had clean  towels & room made up daily. 
The breakfast was lovely, with plenty of choice. We did not eat in the restaurant or drink in the bar.
The only slight negatives were that our room was above the bar, so we could hear music when we were in bed. The music stopped just after midnight on the 1st night & about 11.30pm on the 2nd. Whether that was because someone else had complained I'm not sure. I did not feel that it was necessary to complain, however, it would be annoying if you had an early start the next day.

Our room was very warm, but as it was at the front of the hotel looking onto the main road, I had to close the window at night to sleep. 
I would recommend this hotel and I would book to stay there again. I would request a quieter room next time though. ¬£110 for both nights with breakfast was very reasonable. 
",4,2014,04,18
219,Stay at North Star,Excellent hotel. It was a last minute trip but I was still treated 1st class. Next time I will avail of the gym and sauna. Great location and close to all amenities. Located only five minutes walk from everywhere I needed to be.,5,2014,04,18
219,top hotel,"very friendly staff especially in the bar and restaurant the room was very clean and tidy and excellent value for money, the breakfasts were very good and there was lots of choice would definitely stay here again",5,2014,04,17
219,Lovely!,"The hotel was absolutely gorgeous, well priced and well placed! I'm so glad we decided to stay here! The room was lovely, the staff were very pleasant as well! Would stay here again and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Dublin.",5,2014,04,17
219,Very Nice,"Nice Central location, Hotel is very good and The Staff even better.
Breakfast was great with plenty to choose from.
May seem expensive but when you can eat what you want it is no more expensive than you would pay anywhere else.
The evening meal is also good with a good varied choice.
Will book again when I visit Dublin Again.",5,2014,04,17
219,1st trip to Ireland,"Rooms were very nice. Didn't know that you need your room key to activate lights. Front desk should have told us. Tub was very high and hard to step out of. Not safe for older customers. Loved the electric tea pot and had plenty in room. 

The restaurant and bar were excellent. Staff was amazing - very friendly.",4,2014,04,16
219,Great!,"A perfect hotel with all service you might be needed on your stay in Dublin! Staf 24 hours every day, big and clean rooms, restaurant and pub:) And just 6 minutes walk from shopping street! 
You can also get special price at the hotel on the tourist busses ""hop on hop "" and they also help you with taxi service. ",5,2014,04,16
219,Good Tourist Class Hotel,"The rooms are larger than typical tourist class hotels and are quite comfortable.  The staff was friendly.  The breakfast was typical fare for the region which didn't do a lot for me but was well done.  It is  quiet hotel compared to the south side of the Liffey or OConnell Street.
The building is interesting in that it weaves in and out of the rail tracks and has central open beer garden.  Instead of being a typical square with one room on top of the other it reminded me a bit of a country inn.  
There is a sauna and gym in the basement and they offer airport shuttle service for a small fee.  The location was convenient to Connelly Station and immediately around the corner from Bursas (better for using the LAUS).",4,2014,04,16
219,Love staying here,"Couldn't ask for better, great value. Great food. Perfect location. We stay here each time we go to Dublin. Will continue to do so. In fact just booked another stay.
The breakfast is good and the restaurant always great, especially the service
Try the cocktails too. ",4,2014,04,16
219,Fab Hotel,"We stayed here for St Patricks Day, there was 8 of us. 
The hotel is good location, a short walk from O'Connell St, theres a few bars nearby. 
Rooms were clean, fresh towels every day too. Breakfast was a hot buffet which was really good. Would definetly stay here again!",5,2014,04,16
219,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"we stayed there on holiday, for St. Patrick's Day 2014.
warm welcome, staff very kind and HELPUFL.
our room was very big and well furnished, also very clean
we chose this hotel cause it's near the city centre (TEMPLE BAR etc.) 
and we visited Dublin entirely on foot.
you won't regret it

ps: in front of CONNOLLY STATION (we took a direc train to Belfast, only 2 hours!!!!!)",5,2014,04,16
219,Dublin 9&10/4/14,"Started with our trip to the hotel on the 'Paddywagon' this was great and the bus driver dropped us just around the corner from the hotel.  A great hotel, staff very friendly and helpful.  Gave us a very helpful map to get around Dublin.  Used the City Bus and tram.  Room was lovely with a comfy bed.  Had dinner there for the first night and because it was so good we opted to eat there on the second night!  Look out for the special deals each day of the week - Wednesday night was 2 for 1 cocktails which I took advantage of.  

If I was to make one small complaint it would be that on entering the reception area of the hotel, the smell of fish was quite noticeable.  I know their menu includes a 'catch of the day' but I did find it a little off-putting to start with.

Overall however I thought the hotel was excellent.  Thank you.",5,2014,04,16
219,Dublin March 2014,"Had an overnight stay in Dublin and got a great deal on B&B at The North Star. The stay was mostly good. Room a bit too warm on arrival but that was easily sorted. A bit of noise from the nearby railway line but not too bad. Breakfast was very good. 
Reception staff and staff at breakfast were very good too.
Would have no hesitation in staying again",4,2014,04,16
219,First visit to Dublin,"I stayed with a couple of friends for the weekend on our 1st visit to Dublin. We had a warm welcome & stayed in a triple room. Staff were really helpful, hotel was kept very clean, nice bar although didn't eat there. We had breakfast in the main breakfast area & it was lovely although it is a buffet breakfast & the plates quite small to fit it all on.
The bathroom was well stocked for everything & we had clean towels daily. The tea/coffee/milk was replenished regularly so there was no scrimping on how much milk to have! At the end of our stay we were able to leave our baggage at the hotel for no extra charge which was great as our flight wasn't till 4.30pm. Overall a really good stay.
I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the train track that was literally 50 yards from our bedroom window. We probably could have moved but as we only used it really as a base, didn't bother making a fuss. Would definitely recommend & definitely come again.",4,2014,04,16
219,"Clean, friendly and excellent location","Stayed at the North Star Hotel, sharing a twin room with my Mum and we had other members of our party staying in other rooms in the hotel. My Mum paid a little extra to have a premier room and it made a big difference, our room was lovely - big high beds with nice comfy bedding and a really nice, modern, fitted bathroom with a cascade shower. Hotel is only a 5minute walk away from the millenium spire - which makes it easy to locate after a night in Temple Bar! 
Some of our party stayed in more standard rooms and as much as they were also clean and comfortable, there is definitely a difference - right down to the bedding and the TV.",4,2014,04,16
219,So not stay here!,"Awful, don't waste your time. The hotel has a good PR firm that's for sure, not what it appears online. They threw is in a dormitory room, not even a hotel room. Not a single picture on the wall. You have to leave the main lobby and go outside to enter. Valet was not really valet, they move your car off site! Stay somewhere else to ensure your safety and hassle!",1,2014,04,16
219,Great Hotel,"Having stayed at this hotel a few years ago, I thought that I would go again as I enjoyed my last stay, what a transformation!!  When I had stayed before, I would say it need a bit of a lick of paint, still enjoyed it though and found it comfortable. The refurbishment has totally transformed the place, lovely furnishings, very comfortable and clean, staff are very welcoming and attentive,  the breakfast was fabulous !!  It can be a bit noisy with trains, however that is bound to happen next to a railway, I wore earplugs as my partner snores so it didnt affect me.

Would recommend and will definitely return",5,2014,04,16
219,our stay in dublin 10/04/14,"if you wish to stay in Dublin for a few nights then you will not go wrong with this hotel. Everything was faultless. The location was good, the rooms were great, the eating/bar area was lovely, we didn't eat there but the food looked superb. we did have breakfast each morning which was excellent. Plenty of tea and coffee in the room and shower gels etc in the bathroom. also had a good flat screen tv, steam iron and board and a hair dryer. railway line very close by to our room but never heard a thing. really comfy bed and pillows (nice and firm,not hard) .well equipped gym and a nice sauna (didn't get chance to use them though). Terrific value for money too. best of all,  really friendly and helpful staff all round, from reception to bar staff to cleaners. If we ever go back to Dublin then this is where we will stay. 5* hotel I say. well done North Star Hotel. you should be proud of yourselves .",5,2014,04,15
219,Such a warm welcome,"Claire, the Manager and her staff are so welcoming.!! A family arriving with a disabled member can cause a problem for many hotels, not the staff here!!! Claire organised blended food, sorted out a gluten free meal,and made sure our accommodation was suitable for us.
The meal in the hotel was fabulous, a long time since I have had a better one!!! The newly refurbished restaurant is beautiful, ambient and the food is delicious. The staff are friendly, professional and really helpful too.Claire listens to your needs and makes it happen! What more can we ask for?? The rooms are quite good for disability. You have to go outside the hotel and in a different entrance, the corridor and turning circle for a wheel chair are a bit tight but the bathroom was really a good size and we were able to manage fairly well. 

I would love hotels to consult with families who have a child with a disability to find out what our needs are  but the North Star hotel was a lovely experience!",5,2014,04,13
219,"Wooden floor, too noisy","I'm staying at the hotel for 3 nights. The staff was extremely nice upon arrival. We even got an upgrade and early check in at no charge. However, the corridors and rooms have wooden floors covered with carpets. The wood makes so much noise it's very difficult to sleep at night as when someone passes by your room not only will the floor on the inside of your room move but also you will be awaken. I don't have sleeping problems but in a quite night sleep the floor's noise is very loud. I would come back if it weren't for that big problem. However, as I couldn't sleep well for 2 nights now I wouldn't recommend it. ",3,2014,04,13
219,Always an enjoyable stay.,"We always book in to this hotel when staying over night,or for the weekend in Dublin, with the kids or by ourselves as a couple and a few times with friends when going to gigs in the 02, Vicar St, etc. Its location is perfect as regards trains, the Luas, buses etc and the staff have always been very friendly, pleasant and helpful. There is a relaxed atmosphere around the whole hotel itself, from reception to bar staff and managers. On our most recent stay in March a few weeks ago, whilst checking in, we were delighted to be informed that we had been upgraded to one of their premier suites at no extra charge. Well we were over the moon and fell in love with their fantastic King Sized bed with Egyptian cotton sheets. It made our stay even more enjoyable. We are really looking forward to our next stay and definitely upgrading again. I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2014,04,11
219,Lovely staff but improvements needed,"Great value hotel, great location and very friendly staff. Clean rooms and cosy beds. The room service breakfast could have been a lot better - it was very early and good of them to do it but the coffee was undrinkably bad, no milk for coffee or cereal, no croissants and only one slide of toast each... Not a satisfying breakfast! Otherwise great.",4,2014,04,11
219,"Great location, lovely rooms & brilliant restaurant","We visited this Monday & Tuesday for a hen party, we had a great time.

We were early for check in so left our bags & popped into the bar for a Guinness :) the bartender was so friendly and pointed out places of interest on a map along with some bars & clubs for the evenings

We were allowed to check in to our rooms earlier than expected. The room was a great size for 4 people; 2 singles & 1 double. We had a large shower & complimentary toiletries, there was an iron, tv, ample of storage & hair dryer too.

We dined at the restaurant that evening and had a lovely meal with complimentary glasses of prosecco :)
We ordered chicken & beef burgers and sausage & mash, all of us enjoyed the meal. 

Our room was cleaned & towels refreshed once we left the room at midday. On our final evening the hotel kindly booked us a taxi to our restaurant.

We had a fantastic stay and will be definitely be retuning with my partner later this year :) x

",5,2014,04,11
219,"Poor return visit, lack of customer service.","I have reviewed this hotel in recent months, and I was very happy with my stay. As a result I chose to return to The North Star Hotel for one night. 
As we travel quite a lot, we thought it would be a good idea to contact the hotel direct for the best price, after doing this I was shocked to be told that one night would cost over ‚Ç¨200. I looked around and found a price of ‚Ç¨62 on Hotels4u (including breakfast).
Our check in wasn't very swift and I was surprised when I was asked for ID on checking in. We weren't greeted, welcomed or acknowledged as return customers. 
Our room was tiny. The bathroom was also tiny. There was a stain on one of the walls but apart from that it was clean, just very small. Our view was of the car park.

There were a lot of young, drunk guests also at the time we stayed. It felt like a hostel at times.

It was breakfast that cemented our decision not to return to this hotel. The last time we stayed breakfast was probably the highlight of our stay, however when we waited to be seated we were told to sit at a table by a rude, abrupt female member of staff. She then said 'tea or coffee?' With her back turned to us in the most rude, abrupt tone I've ever experienced from hospitality staff. There were only two female servers, this particular one had her hair up and was the younger of the two. She then sat another couple right beside us (there was an inch of a gap between the tables) when there was barely anyone in the dining room. The whole experience was awkward and rushed. I witnessed her lack of customer service with other people so I wouldn't be surprised if she earns more complaints for The North Star. 

Not a very warm welcome back from the North Star. So as a result...We won't be back. ",2,2014,04,10
219,Good value for money,"Smooth check-in and check-out the next morning by a very helpful gentleman at Reception. Rooms nice, bright, up to date  and modern. Breakfast well presented and good quality. Good location with lots of things to see and do within walking distance. 
Only downfall: no hot water in the morning and awkward to get to rooms - lots of stairs!",4,2014,04,09
219,superb,"We travelled down to dublin by train . Booked train and hotel through NI railway travel service short breaks deal.It was our 25th anniversary and receptionist congratulated us on our arrival which was lovely hotel just across road from connelly station , it was our first time in dublin and didnt want to tramp around looking for hotel so superb location only 10 min walk tomain shopping area and the liffy with all its lovely bridges to walk across. Our room was lovely it was a premiere one with a little baloncyoverlooking a quiet side street hubby has sensitive hearing but didnt complain once of noise which is unusal for him, his only gripe was the bed was a little soft for his liking oh its huge by the way. He loved the big tv and I loved having a fridge in room to store freshmilk for tea cant stand those uht capsules. Wifi was good and free grat for organising our trips to tourist attractions. Room super clean made up every day breakfast was great served up to 10am during the week so no really early wakeup calls breakfast room was large and deco was lovely, lots of mirrors in this hotel hubby had the staff chuckling as he couldnt resist admiring himself! Breaky included fruit ,yogurts ,cereal, various breads ,and full range of cooked items fried eggs were always perfect and yes we sampled everything on offer! Dont think hotel made any money that week! Our break included one  3 course dinner which was so lovely we dined there again on another night lovely food good value,super pleasant and efficent staff both in the restaurant and breakfast room cant wait to go back! Thankyou north star for a fabulous 25th anniversary break",5,2014,04,09
219,Good place to stay,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend break and thought that it was good value for money, on arrival Simon on reception was very good and full of information about places to eat and drink, also the best places to visit, and how to get to them, if we wanted to walk.

The room was standard and clean and we stayed on the 6th floor and used the premier lounge which was relaxing and a great place to have a coffee, breakfast was very good and the staff attentive, we also had a dinner at the restaurant which was well presented and tasty.

The hotel is close to all especially the bus stop from the airport which means that you do not have to carry luggage far.

All in all we would recommend staying at this hotel",4,2014,04,08
219,Very disappointing,"I stayed here with my brother for 4 nights, and had high hopes for this hotel but overall I was disappointed. The lobby was nice, the location is great to hop on a train or walk around the city, and the rooms were ok, but we ran into quite a few issues. The TV simply did not work in our room, the wifi in our room simply did not work, and our toilet simply did not work! For the money we were paying, those should not be issues. I am not one to complain very much, but the size of the rooms were A LOT smaller than the pictures on the website made it seem. 

To make things worse, I booked a taxi through the front desk for the following morning at 6am, and when I went out to meet my taxi, it never showed! I went to the front desk and they called the taxi company who then told me they had not gotten a call from the hotel for a taxi. This was unacceptable. On a similar note, the hotel has an airport shuttle service. When we took the shuttle to the airport we left 40 minutes late! Again, unacceptable. 

Its too bad all these issues came up because I feel it was a great location. But honestly, its just not worth staying here.",2,2014,04,06
219,"Great hotel, lovely breakfast, great value for money!","Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for a long weekend, and we couldn't praise it enough!  
From the decor to the friendliness of the staff everything was first class especially breakfast! 
Would definitely stay here again :) ",5,2014,04,01
219,mothers day weekend,"Really enjoyed our stay at the North Star Hotel. Right from the beginning the staff were so 
helpful and pleasant. We were upgraded to a premier suite which we loved.We had dinner before going to  The Bord Gais theatre, the meal was excellent, the restaurant. staff were very courteous.
We enjoyed a very good breakfast, lots of variety to suit all tastes, staff very attentive. This is my second stay in The North Star Hotel and I look forward to many more visits!",5,2014,03,30
219,Good overall,"The staff were extremely helpful with suggestions of places to see and things to do. The room could have been nicer, but it was decent value for money. We checked in early and slightly late at no extra cost.",4,2014,03,29
219,Fantastic location with great breakfast included in price,Staff very helpful and friendly. Liked that we were able to park the car at the hotel. Room very clean and a good size. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of variety. Really good stay and would go back. Good value for money.,4,2014,03,29
219,Mixed feeling!,"First the positives: The staff of the hotel are friendly and always ready to help. The hotel itself, is located just opposite the Connolly train station, so the location was a great plus point. We went on a package trip and had breakfast included. The continental buffet breakfast had nice variety and was ample.
Drawbacks: We were not very impressed with our room which was in level 1. The room was clean but it was a bit dingy, probably because we had the package deal? 
Overall though, we enjoyed our stay and enjoyed Dublin!",3,2014,03,26
219,Really Enjoyed My Stay,"I stayed here on business - primarily booked due to proximity to our office but I would happily return for business or pleasure.  The staff are all extremely friendly, polite and accommodating, particularly the bar and restaurant staff who are brilliant and very funny.  Food was delicious - fabulous full english (irish?) breakfast with a great selection of other goodies, and I ate in the restaurant one night too which was excellent.

The room had everything I needed and aircon that actually worked. The only slight ""downsides"" were that the bath towels were absolutely tiny, there was not a great selection of english TV channels and the mini bar was empty.  Not good for my midnight munchies!  But a great place to stay.",4,2014,03,26
219,Fantasic Hotel - Friendly Staff,"I have just returned from a trip to Dublin and we had stayed at the North Star Hotel. 
In all honestly we were a little worried as we found the price of the hotel cheap so we weren‚Äôt expecting very much and boy were we surprised.

As soon as you walk in you are met with smiling faces and a homely feel, beautifully decorated, lovely and warm! Ok, we thought, maybe the rooms aren‚Äôt great and again we were wrong. Lovely size room, plenty of storage and warm bedding another big thumbs up! Breakfast was incredible, lots to choose from and it was nice a hot, just want you needed after a few pints of Guinness. 

Location was fantastic, 10 min walk to the city center of Dublin, right by a bus station and a train station should we wish to venture further than Dublin City!. 

Overall, I was very impressed with this hotel and will certainly we staying there again.",5,2014,03,25
219,just ok,not great location. hard to find. partial elevator - pain to lug bags up steps. expensive car park and not part of hotel. wifi in room didn't work and lousy tv- plus loud from train. rooms clean and people nice but prob wouldn't stay there again.,3,2014,03,23
219,Great stay. Annoying noise in our room though,"The hotel was in a great location. Easy to get from the airport, close to the O2, easy access to the town and close to the luas. 

The room was brilliant and the staff very accommodating. 

Only issue was a loud buzzing sound which could be heard in our room throughout the night. Sounded a bit like a large fridge!

Overall a pleasant stay. Will recommend but advise to steer clear of room 752! !",4,2014,03,23
219,Good value for money,"We stayed at the North Star Hotel in north Dublin for 3 nights. The hotel has been newly refurbished recently but still smelled old and unpleasant in some areas, e.g. the gym, the residents' lounge, and to a lesser extent, the bathroom in the room we stayed at. 

Location: 
The airport link bus stop towards city centre was just across the corner within a 2-minute walk. 
Connolly rail station and Luas stop are just across the road, and Bus√°ras Bus Station is just down the road. 
5-minute walk to O'Connell Street, one of the main streets
15-minute walk crossing the River Liffey to Grafton Street, where there are also lots of shops but the area appears more high-end

Quietness: I requested a quiet room away from the main street and railway which was what we got. Occasionally you do hear trains pass but it wasn't that loud nor frequent. And trains don't pass during sleeping hours anyway.

Wifi: The wifi signal in our room wasn't brilliant so Mr B and I ended up having to go to the residents' lounge at times. There you could experience the whole floor vibrating accompanied by really loud train noises when trains pass.
The gym: One of the reasons I chose the hotel was because of the gym. There was a good variety of machines but none of them were switched on and I gave up on trying after a while. There were no staff around to help and I couldn't be bothered to ask the reception about it. The place also smelled very strongly of food in a bad way as the breakfast room was in the basement as well.

Breakfast: Buffet style. A good variety of choices from cereal to pastry things to full Irish breakfast. Found it bizarre that some guests were down for continental breakfast only and told they shouldn't take any of the hot food. 

The room itself: Very clean with tea making facilities. Adequate size.",4,2014,03,22
219,Short Stay,"Stayed for 2 nights, found the staff helpful, requested an early checkin which thankfully was available. Room was spacious we were on the 7th floor with a rail line running past but this posed no issue. Breakfast was ample and the closeness to the areas of Dublin we wanted was great, within walking distance.",5,2014,03,21
219,Ok hotel nothing wrong but nothing over the top,We stayed two nights as part of a package deal. This was are least favorite of all the hotels we stayed. The breakfast was good. The staff were friendly enough. I had no problems here but it did not wow us either. Good location to walk to town.,3,2014,03,18
219,Great value for money,"Stayed in the North Star hotel in early January. A friend and myself were going down to Dublin for the weekend and wanted somewhere handy to the city to stay. My parents had recommended this hotel as they often stay there when in Dublin. 

We travelled down on the train from Belfast, the station is so handy, literally across the road. The receptionist was very welcoming, allowing us to store our bags until we were able to check in. The d√©cor in the hotel is beautiful, free wifi in the lobby was an added bonus.

When we finally got into our room later that day we were surprised at how big it was. It was very clean and it looked like it had been recently redecorated. The only major problem was the noise in the room. Our room was situated right above the bar and you could hear the music so clearly in our room. In the end, I had to ring down to reception as I couldn't sleep. They were very accommodating and turned the music off for us.

The breakfast the next morning was delicious and there was a wide selection of foods to choose from.

I have booked into the North Star again for my next trip to Dublin, but will be avoiding staying in a room directly above the bar.",4,2014,03,17
219,Average,"Alot of noise from outside, the hotel is seriously overheated. Accessibility to upper floors is a nightmare: my eldery mother struggled up and down the stairs. Front desk staff quite rude. One passing staff member offered to carry my bag up, another staff member directed us to the lift which was a bit painful to find. Bed was comfortable, location good. Room was poky. 4 of us were squeezed in. Clean. Not worth the money we paid. ‚Ç¨7.50 return to the 02 for the concert per person and the luas down the road for cheaper. They should be ashamed of themselves charging that price. ",2,2014,03,16
219,"Excellent hotel, great central location","We stayed in the North Star recently for a concert. Hotel has a beautiful lobby, bar and our room was perfect. The hotel had a shuttle bus going straight to the concert venue which collected us again after the concert. The hotel was very clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious also. And the hotel is located across the street from Connolly train station which was handy and we heard no noise from the station which was great. Staying here again soon.",5,2014,03,16
219,Great stay!,"Stayed a few nights before St. Patricks day so I expected hotels to be quite expensive but me and my boyfriend got this hotel for a great price. It's in a good location.. short walk to temple bar area and just beside busaras bus station so very convenient. The reception was lovely.. and I was pleasently surprised at the size and look of the room! Our free breakfast in the morning was really nice and the hotel allowed us to leave our bags at check out to collect later. Great value, clean and spacious.. especially for a city hotel! :) ",5,2014,03,16
219,North Star Hotel - Premier Club Suites,"Centrally located and only a short walk into the Temple Bar area of the city. Clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful.
I arrived on early flight getting to hotel at 9am expecting to just drop off cases but were able to go to our allocated room. Exceeded our expectations in service.",4,2014,03,14
219,City Break,Centrally located and only a short walk into the Temple Bar area of the city. Clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. We arrived on early flight getting to hotel at 9am expecting to just drop off cases but were able to go to our allocated room. Exceeded our expectations in service. Use concierge for information and discount on tours and buses. Food is very good both breakfast and evening meal and comparatively priced to eating out in the city. Catch 747 bus from airport 10 euro return. This is cheaper than AirCoach and the 747 stops near hotel.,4,2014,03,13
219,Second visit to the north star hotel,"this was my second visit to this lovely hotel, although i was a little dissapointed that mccoy's irish pub was gone, i was pleasantly suprised by the refurb downstairs of the cookhouse and bar, the food was awesome and no more expensive than anywhere else i had tried in dublin in fact a little cheaper....but such good quality and generous portions, the staff here are amazing so friendly and the service fab nothing is too much trouble, the room was the same as the two yrs previous i had stayed, really lovely, fantastic beds lovely bathroom....the rest of my party, there were 11 of us were really impressed......and I will definately be going back again next time I am lucky enough to visit the wonderful city of Dublin....I really didnt want to leave!",5,2014,03,12
219,Good night stay,"Stayed here for one night on the 11th March as me and my boyfriend was in Dublin to go to the Beyonce concert in the O2. Got a city link bus which took us to the hotel. Could not check in until 2pm but we was able to store our bags at the hotel and go for a wander around the local area. Arriving back at 2pm the room was ready. The room was an average hotel room. Was clean, tidy and modern. Not the rooms that was pictured on the website though but that is just to do with colours etc. all staff seemed friendly. Had a residents lounge which is a really good idea. The hotel also done a airport shuttle bus for only 5 euros per person. This was perfect for us as we had a very early morning flight. Shuttle bus arrived on time but was left waiting for two guests to come down cause they had overslept. 
Only moan I would have is that the hotel website does state that rooms are sound proof. This is not the case - the walls seemed paper thin but this didn't bother us. 
",4,2014,03,12
219,Perfect hotel.,The hotel  is situated north of the Liffey. A good location for public transport. The rooms are big and clean. Breakfast is elaborate : continental as well as full Irish. It was our second stay at the hotel and next time we are in Dublin we will definately go back to the hotel.,4,2014,03,12
219,A Hidden Gem and Best Value in Dublin,"This hotel is a gem and totally unknown. It has been totally refurbished and can now match any four star hotel in Dublin but at extremely reasonable rates.

Being opposite Connolly Station it is in an ideal location for travellers.

The breakfast is one of the best I have seen in any hotel and the food super. The staff are friendly and will do anything to help.

I know this sounds like it was written by the hotel but it is not and is absolutely true and I stay in over 100 hotels per year and this is one of the best. I cannot recommend it too highly and I do not tolerate poor hotels easily..

Michael Grimes",5,2014,03,12
219,Really lovely- perfect for weekend away,"Me and 2 friends decided to go to Dublin for the weekend to visit a old work colleague who now lives there. Had an amazing weekend and the hotel was really lovely, I was pleasantly surprised. We were just going to book a Travelodge or something as wanted to do the trip cheaply. As the rugby was on everywhere was fully booked so we booked the North Star, lovely d√©cor, looks like it has been recently modernised and the hotel bar was really nice. 

Was so pleased we picked this hotel and paid a bit more

Great location for everything we wanted to do, I would totally recommend a trip to the Guinness store house and use the red tour bus as was really reasonable and will show you everything u need to see. 

I would definitely recommend a friend to stay there",4,2014,03,12
219,Nice but flawed,"After flying from the US, a shower is imperative. I was disheartened to find out there was no hot water. Guest services came and said I just needed to let the water run a little longer. Thus began my vacation, waking up up every day to have to let the water run prior to getting in the shower. The room was very clean, as was the hotel in general. The location was superb. To be considered four stars, I expect to have hot water without having to wait fifteen minutes. ",3,2014,03,11
219,good location,"We came up for the weekend had a great time.This hotel is in a good location and there are plenty of buses and taxis.The room was lovely, nice and clean.The breakfast was lovely. The only fault i have is the dinner wasnt that great and if you wanted veg you would have to pay for it which in my opinion is rediculous but overall all a good stay",4,2014,03,11
219,Beautiful clean modern hotel great atmosphere and service,"Really nice hotel great service and food ! Good location great breakfast and very efficient friendly staff, the shuttle bus to O2 is great, room very modern and stylish. Had a great sleep very comfortable beds!",5,2014,03,11
219,Excellent short break,"Just had a wonderful two night stay at the North Star. Close to the station and easy walk to all the attractions. Excellent accommodation and friendly, efficient service.Would recommend this hotel to all. Excellent value too! - can you tell I was impressed!",5,2014,03,09
219,A Wonderful Hotel with Very High Standards.,"This hotel came as a shock to me. It's somewhere I'd never considered before, in fact I'd never heard of it but I'm so glad I discovered it.

This hotel is very stylish in a comfortable way. The rooms are very tastefully decorated, beds are very comfortable and every room is well equipped. The standard of cleanliness is outstanding. The rooms are impeccably serviced every day by a team of very smart and very polite staff. In fact every member of staff I encountered over 6 nights were very helpful, friendly and professional. The staff really stand out as being so professional, far more so than in virtually every other hotel I've stayed in.

The food is first class, the bar is well stocked and not as over-priced as many others are. There are comfortable communal areas, a quiet residents lounge, a gym & sauna and a concierge in the reception to help plan any day trips etc.

The hotel is within easy walking distance of O'Connell Street and there is a Luas (tram) station opposite the hotel. There are supermarkets and restaurants within a two minute walk of the hotel. It's an ideal hotel for a stay in Dublin. I'm very impressed indeed.",5,2014,03,08
219,North Star Hotel : A great find !,"North Star is in the process of upgrading to 4 star.
There is a distinction however,between Premier Club Suites and the regular hotel rooms.
The Two of us stayed in the regular rooms.
A short walk from the very centre,15 mins,the value was outstanding. 
Walking is no problem,even at night.
If it were located in Temple Bar,room prices would at least, be doubled.
Staff are obliging,rooms comfortable,breakfast very tasty,
The hotel is sparkling clean and a good place to relax.
Bar staff are great.
There is a rail station opposite,but the commuter access is round the back.
Train noise is not a problem,as they do not run through the night.
I certainly recommend.",4,2014,03,07
219,Our stay in Dublin,"First we booked a package with Aer Lingus and got a great deal. We stayed here for 7 nights, in one of the older rooms which is very small and a bit dated. Rooms are clean and staff a very good. The website advertises a free continental breakfast, not true unless you are on premium package, not even coffe service in lobby. The breakfast available for sale I thought was a bit pricey. Overall if you don't mind a small room no continental breakfast, and you are looking for central location good choice. Restaurant is excellent.   ",3,2014,03,06
219,very pleasant experience,"We thoroughly recommend this Hotel to those looking for really good and comfortable accommodation, at reasonable cost, and at a location within 15 minutes of walking distance from the City's main throughfare at O'Connell Street.  We booked online and got a special offer of ¬£67.73 for an overnight stay with full breakfast for 2 adults.

On arrival (mid February 2014) there we found that a massice and very attractive refurbishing had been completed since our last visit 4 years ago.  The Hotel is ideally suitable for those arriving in the city, either by rail or by bus, as both stations are within 5 minutes walk from the North Star.  The Staff employed there, without exception, did everything possible to make our all too brief visit a very pleasant memory.  We also decided to have our evening meal there and lunch too before departing.  The quality of the food and range of options to choose from were excellent.",5,2014,03,03
219,A Pleasant stay,"Stayed here Sat 1st March. I was pleasantly surprised by the standard of d√©cor. Check in was prompt, room spotless. Good location, just across road from Connelly Station and a short walk to Temple Bar area. Nice bar and restaurant in Hotel and seems popular without being overcrowded. Beds were comfortable, although room was quite warm. Too noisy outside to open window as often the case in City break hotels of this type. However, there was air con. Breakfast was great, plenty to choose from. There was a spa that I didn't get to use and I certainly did not pay 149 euros for 1 night. If I had I might have knocked a star off or grounds of not being as good value. But would def stay here again.",5,2014,03,03
219,Not worth ‚Ç¨149 per night,"Reception staff were prompt and helpful. The heat in the room was unbearable, for luck we had a ""premier room"" with a balcony for fresh air but couldn't leave that open all night as Connolly station was directly outside our window and also our balcony was joined to the room next door. Toilet wouldn't flush. Very annoying. We didn't complain about this as we didn't want people going in and out of our room nor did we want to have to sit in the hotel room while they fixed it so we said nothing. We paid ‚Ç¨149 for a twin room with only a continental breakfast included (no hot food) I thought this was a bit steep. Could hear everything in the corridor from the bedroom, people walking, talking and dragging luggage so very broken sleep from early morning. Very early checkout too 11:30am.",3,2014,03,02
219,Great breakfasts,"Stayed at this hotel for a short midweek break in February. Easy to get to from the airport by the 747 Airlink shuttle bus that drops you off just around the corner from the hotel.  The room was very clean and appeared to have been recently refurbished. Nice size bathroom with a full size bath and shower.
We had asked for a quiet room and it was on the opposite side of the hotel to Connolly Station but unfortunately the window didn't close properly and we could hear traffic and people passing in the street, even though we were on the fourth floor. That said it didn't spoil our stay and wasn't worth mentioning to reception. The hotel is a ten minute walk to O'Connell Street and about twenty minutes to Temple Bar. The hotel Resteraunt has a decent menu and the prices are similar to others in Dublin, although they all seem quite expensive now, ¬£11.00 for two pints of lager in Temple Bar. The staff were very friendly and the breakfasts were exceptional, well cooked and variety of cereals/fruit. All help yourself so you can stock up for the day ahead. Would stay here again and recommend it to others.",4,2014,03,02
219,Quirky hotel in a great location.,An individual hotel within walking distance to the city centre. The stay was spoiled due to the fact I had no hot water and after returning to   a cold room it took staff nearly 40 minutes to switch the heating on in my room not ideal as this occured after midnight! ,3,2014,03,02
219,Four in a Bed Style Review,"How were your hosts at the North Star Hotel? - 8/10
The staff in the hotel were, on the whole, pretty good. The bar man and reception staff were great, particularly when we realised that we had left our key in our room and they got us back in quickly and without hassle. The breakfast staff were good but there just weren't enough of them really.

How clean was the North Star Hotel? - 7/10
The hotel and room itself were very clean but the room had an odour to it that wasn't too nice. It's my understanding that up until recently smoking was allowed in the hotel and I think that's what the smell was so, hopefully, in time that will improve.

How were facilities at the North Star Hotel? - 3/10
The room itself was nice, far nicer than I expected with quite modern, comfortable decor. There was a small table and two chairs in the room plus a desk with a mirror and light above it, which is nice as not all have them and they're useful for doing make up at. The things that let the room down were the TV that looked about as old as we were, it was an old big back CRT TV with very few channel choices and no way to see what was on the different channels other than to flick, not a major issue as we weren't there to watch TV but a little bit of a disappointment. The big issue though was the shower which was, well, pathetic. It had a very poor water flow and the temperature control wasn't great either, it would go between hot and cold without you even adjusting anything and one morning was so hot that it was impossible to shower properly.

How did you sleep at the North Star Hotel? - 9/10
Comfortable bed with good pillows and duvet but it would have been nice to be able to open the window for some fresh air.

How was breakfast at the North Star Hotel? - 8/10
Nice food, freshly prepared and hot. Bit slow to get seated at times as there weren't really enough staff and sometimes things like sauces went unfilled because of that.

Would you at the North Star Hotel again? Yes (as long as it had a better shower!)",4,2014,03,01
219,Weekend break,This hotel was fab the staff were brilliant and very helpful. The food was gorgeous plenty of variety in the menu also it was affordable to stay. The only downfall is the antisocial behaviour that goes on outside the hotel by young people we were cursed at etc walking past them totally put me off! But I suppose it's out of the hotels control other then that I would definitely return to the North Star hotel :) ,4,2014,03,01
219,Good location near Connelly train station,A nice brisk walk to Temple Bar area.  Cool pubs in the area with train station across the street.  Rooms are typical European rooms but good nights sleep.  Didn't visit the restaurant on site but it looked good.,4,2014,02,27
219,Lovely Hotel,"We have just returned from a two night break at this hotel and have nothing bad to say about it at all. The rooms were clean and really nicely finished, the air-con worked well too. Although we generally like to explore we did eat in the hotel restaurant on the first night because we hadn't quite found our bearings in the dark and rain and time was getting on. We found the next day that its really easy to walk everywhere from the hotel and although we didn't seem to be walking through the most exclusive end of town it felt really safe. The concierge was really helpful in sorting us out with the tickets for the open top bus tour.",4,2014,02,26
219,Amazing 3nt Break.,"What a fantastic stay we had ..... Thank you North Star. Conveniently situated in the heart of Dublin and walking distance to anywhere. Clean hotel and rooms, very efficient and attentive staff especially the overly helpful barman who made a special Whiskey drink just for me ..... Dublin dream !! We would most definitely love to come and stay again. A fantastic short break for myself and fianc√© . Thanks again. ",5,2014,02,22
219,Great gift,"This hotel was booked by our children for our Xmas present, although we had just a basic room, we were pleasantly surprised, very spacious even with one double and two single beds, great to have a table and chairs (so often there is only one chair) really clean, well stocked with toiletries as well as tea and coffee...having read that the rooms were noisy we did not find them too bad even with the window open and over looking the station.
Staff were pleasant on all occasions,
The only thing I found wrong was the poor barman was rushed off his feet resulting in the bar being full of empties, maybe some of the other staff could of helped !",4,2014,02,20
219,Fantastic,"My husband and I booked this hotel and was pleasant surprised when we got rhere. Thinking it was 3 star but when we arrived it was lovely and all staff were great nothing was too much trouble . The rooms were clean and modern with all facilities , fresh towels daily , and all toiletries provided.
The breakfast was super , excellent quality and plenty of it.
The whole thing was a great experience and made our first visit to Ireland a one to remember , we will defo be returning and recommending the North Star Hotel to others 
10 out of 10 in every aspect
 ",4,2014,02,19
219,great hotel,"excellent value, rooms were clean, staff were really helpful and friendly and breakfast was really good, not too far to walk to shops, bars etc and being so close to the station was not an issue, not disturbed by any noise",5,2014,02,19
219,Can't Fault!,"Ive stayed here maybe 5 times all short 1/2 day breaks! Have stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin city but this always stands out! The beds are so comfortable! Staff are friendly and welcoming along with cleaners saying Hello in the mornings :) (the amount of hotels where cleaners pass you by without a look or word, I find extremely rude!!) ive stayed as a couple and as family! they were great with my 1 year old at breakfast chatting away to him which he loved ! Great location! Breakfast is good an hot, plenty to chose from! Oh not to mention the barman that made a me Mocha even when there weren't on the Menu!!

Looking forward to my late Valentines night that I have booked with you's Tomorrow :)",4,2014,02,18
219,Really Great Hotel,"I booked this trip via Groupon and really didn't know what to expect but I have to say that this place has exceeded all expectation.
Really good size room with all mod cons, lovely clean bathroom and powerful shower, attentive and  Knowledgeable staff in particular Simon and Maria who welcomed us to the hotel.
Although we did not eat at the hotel, the menu was well priced.
Breakfast is amazing and the bed very comfy.
Would stay again if in Dublin.
",5,2014,02,16
219,Super stay,"We stayed for two nights for the 6 nations rugby and got upgraded as it was busy. Easy walk into the Temple Bar area. Train station across the road (yes, that might annoy some people, I think of it as convenient!) which is 3-4 stops away from the Aviva stadium. Restaurant and bar downstairs are both lovely. Staff really friendly. If I have to think of something that wasn't brilliant it would be the lifts which seem a bit far from the reception area and up a set of stairs - to be fair if that could ruin your stay, then you must have stayed in some pretty amazing ground-floor rooms only hotels!",5,2014,02,14
219,5*,"The hotel was lovely and easy to find. Across from a train station which can only be heard with the window open. Three beds to a room, one small double & 2 single beds. nice sized clean bathroom. Would definitely stay here again. The breakfast buffet was hot and the staff were friendly & helpful.",5,2014,02,14
219,Very Central,"Just returned from a two night stay. Staff very friendly,breakfast excellent, room very clean with all the amenities. The location was perfect. Everything close to hand. Would defiantly stay there again.",4,2014,02,12
219,"Lovely Room, But......","Me and my Fianc√© stayed here in December 2013. The room was lovely, and well kept, lovely big comfy bed, but, the room was like a sauna, it was very hot and just outside our room was very noisy, with the train track and busy freight traffic, but we didn't mind that, we are staying in a city, so you will have to expect noise. But for those who like a silent night, take ear plugs.

The staff are very nice, we didn't interact much with them (our choice, romantic get away) but they were helpful and polite whenever we needed them.

The hotel is an easy walk to the main bars in temple bar and easy commute to and from the airport (we used the bus, was 12E each for a return)

The breakfast was not great and quite expensive for the quality, so we didn't bother with room service on that basis. I did find the restaurant staff quite rude and dismissive.

I would stay again, but maybe mention that the room was hot and have that sorted instead of being shy, and I would take ear plugs. I would also avoid the breakfast. All in all a nice hotel. Some improvements to be made in my opinion, but my main thing was the room and couldn't fault that (except the heat) Perfect for couples",4,2014,02,07
219,Very convenient for Dublin 1,"I stayed at this hotel two nights ago as I was arriving in Dublin by train into Connolly Station. The hotel is right across the road. The check in staff were very efficient and friendly. Wifi was free and straightforward and the room was very comfortable. As it was pouring with rain, I broke one of my usual habits and decided to eat in the hotel. I am so glad I did. The staff were very friendly in the bar/restaurant. I ordered a smoked fish platter as a starter and steak for the main course. The barman was good enough to point out that I probably wouldn't need both but suggested I go for a large platter if I was going to skip the steak. It was quite simply wonderful. Smoked salmon, mackeral and trout - and loads of it! As much bread as anyone could cope with and a fab salad. I will certainly go back and will certainly have the smoked fish board. Full marks all round.",4,2014,02,06
219,"Staff are amazing, would definitley recommend.","Booked this hotel on the recommendation of destination Dublin, as part of a theatre package connected to the Bord Gais Theatre. It was fantastic value and we had a two course meal there as well. On arrival the receptionist was bright and very friendly, the hotel d√©cor is recently done and gives a boutique feeling. The rooms were spotless and the beds were very comfortable, and the d√©cor was very nice. We had dinner in the restaurant (two courses) and it was fantastic, a real credit to the chef.  The service here was also very impressive, with staff being extremely attentive. Likewise breakfast the next morning was great, it was buffet style and you could not want for anything, with great choice available. The staff booked us a cab and came to let us know when it had arrived, so there was no need for waiting by the door. On return the staff asked if we had enjoyed the show and checked again that we had everything we needed.

The only blip was the car park, it is behind the hotel and a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, I had a hard time fitting the car into the space I was directed to (it didn't help that I was driving a car twice the size of my own) and the attendant was getting very irate with me.  I did mention this to the girl on reception along with the fact that I thought I would never get the car out, she apologised and said they would get the car out. The following morning however the car was brought to the hotel door for us.

We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and I have to say the staff made it really, we were amazed how helpful and friendly they were the whole time, a real personal touch to the service.",5,2014,02,05
219,Value for money,"We stayed here as part of a package deal that included breakfast (wasn't great) Dinner (lovely but limited by deal) and tickets to ""Wicked"" the hotel was easily walking distance to the shops & the staff  were super friendly and helpful. It was v clean & lovely decor. Only down side was the breakfast that was quite rubbery as was prob reheated etc. I would def recommend. ",4,2014,02,02
219,Good shame about smoke,"Hotel was clean, staff were great. the part of the hotel we were staying had a strong smell of  cigarate smoke about also sauna not working properly. food was good just ashame about smell would stay again in different part of hotel
      
      
      ",4,2014,01,30
219,Brilliant customer service....,Myself and my husband stayed in the North Star for one night as part of a package with the Bord Gais Theatre. I have to say from the moment we drove into the car park the customer service was top class. Our receptionist couldn't have helped us anymore. She was very friendly. She ensured that we got our dinner in plenty of time before having to leave for the show. She also organised our transport to the theatre. The food in McGettigans was top class and the service was excellent. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,01,29
219,Hotel and show weekend,a great hotel the only thing was the bar had not got beer i like on draft only guinness The food i would recommend and the room was excellent so anyone who stays in it It is central for everything. verygood hotel.,5,2014,01,29
219,Good location,"We were booked here as part of an Aer Lingus package and were a bit apprehensive about the neighborhood after reading reviews.  We needn't have worried.  We found Dublin to be very compact and walkable with all the attractions south of the Liffey within easy reach.  We arrived at six in the morning after our flight, expecting to have to just leave our bags, but were checked right in to sleep for a few hours before hitting the city. The lobby furniture and wooden staircase ooze history, while the rooms are simple, modern and clean.  Daily service left nothing amiss. The buffet breakfast offers a bountiful array of options - priced at either continental or hot inclusive.  The train station across the street made for a convenient jaunt to the country to visit our cousins.",4,2014,01,26
219,Excellent value central hotel,"Needed to stay in Dublin for one night only and picked the North Star as it is very convenient to train station , dart , bus aras and city centre.  It was a real bonus to discover that the staff were very helpful and the room was spacious and clean. Would recommend this hotel to my friends.",5,2014,01,26
219,Weekend stay,"This is a great hotel - very friendly and welcoming staff. We had a premier room on the 6th floor and it was lovely. McGettigans had great cocktails and morning breakfast offered great choice and was yummy! 
Only downside was that one lift was out of operation so there were some long waits to get back to the 6th floor.
If we come back to Dublin we would definitely look to stay here again.",4,2014,01,26
219,History and Comfort,"It was truly wonderful to capture both the history and modern comforting conveniences at the North Star...the renovation of this historic building is very well done/we enjoyed our time in Dublin, and Ireland over all, and cannot wait to return someday :-)",5,2014,01,25
219,Great weekend. Staff excellent. Will be back for sure,We had √† great time in Dublin and have recommended your hotel to many people. Special thanks to claire who surprised us with champagne when we got engaged on our stay. Food great and breakfast plentiful. Cant wait go go back .,5,2014,01,25
219,"Excellent hotel, very friendly staff","We had a great time at the North Star hotel, friendly staff, gorgeous room, very comfortable bed, lovely food and great location with convenient parking.

Will definitely be back at this hotel and would get the train from Belfast as right beside Connolly street train station",5,2014,01,23
219,Excellent service," Really enjoyed my stay at the North Star hotel. Very helpful staff, good location, clean rooms and comfortable beds, Had a meal in the hotel restaurant one night the food and service was very good. Will stay here again when I'm back in Dublin. ;)

219,Wonderful Dublin stay,"I have stayed at the North Star many times before and I have always had a lovely stay! It's friendly and welcoming and the staff are amazing. It's a great location of you want to shop in the city or see something in the theaters, they are all about 5/10 minutes away and the Luas is right across the street. They also have a small onsite car park that is very reasonably priced. I always stay there when I'm in Dublin. They only think I would like to see changed about the place is that the bedding on the premier club rooms being renewed. They were very worn and bobbled,not what I'd expect for a room advertise and priced as a premier room. But that really is the only fault I could ever find with the North Start Hotel. ",5,2014,01,23
219,Dubliners are nuts! :),"great value, good location, good wi-fi, nice service and clean rooms. And it's pretty :)

You will meet a lot of people, willingly or not, and they are so positive and funny! Not all of them are drunk, but it's a common site. :)

Make sure you go and visit the Cliffs of Moher, it's mind blowing.

p.s. Drink as many pints of Guinness as possible!",5,2014,01,23
219,02 concert,"The receptionist who greated my daughter and I when we arrived at the hote,l was really very nice and welcoming. 
The food was lovely and the staff in the restaurant do their job very well. 
We were going to a concert at the 02 arena. If the weather is nice, the distance from the hotel to the 02 is within walking distance. There is a shuttle bus available from the hotel to take you to the 02 arena and the charge for this was around ‚Ç¨7.00 return. 
Very close to busaras.",4,2014,01,23
219,Male staff not very nice,"We got the stay for 55 euro for one night.  I would not pay any more then that the decor of the hotel was shabby and felt very cheap. The male staff on leaving the following day were very rude and dismissive. Especially when we asked them to hold our bags until later that day, when we collected them they were even less friendly and practically threw the bags at us. We normally stay in the beacon hotel and decided for a change never again. And the shower was a disagree it went from hot to cold all the time bad barely a trickle as well. We were also asked to leave the bar by a bar man because we had a child and told we could only use the residents area  not good enough",3,2014,01,23
219,My Second Home!,"Our annual stay here (early January) with the rest of the 'Phil Lynott' Group (part of the Vibe for Philo in memory of Thin Lizzy's frontman/genius).  
We never stay anywhere else, we've now been visiting for nearly 10 years.  And we keep coming back!
This year was slightly different (& slightly disappointing) in that the hotel now has 4 Star rating & transformed the bar area (looks nice but lost it's character) & employed (some) overly-attentive & zealous staff (management) who seem to have a different view of customer service to mine.  HOWEVER, year in year out the long-serving staff are second to none.  They MAKE this hotel - the warm welcomes, their experience, their knowledge, their good humour - THAT is customer service.  So, roll call - Bar Staff: Paddy, Keith, Sean & Co; Vera & the Housekeeping Staff, & Linda (Reservations). A huge ""Thanks a Million"" to each of them - they are the reason we keep on coming back - you make the hotel what it is, 4 Star or not....you always provide a 5 Star service.",4,2014,01,23
219,"Lovely hotel, lovely city","Great hotel short walk from o'connell st. Lovely staff, had a complimentary upgrade to a premium room and free glass of prosecco on arrival. Comfy bed, warm room. Ideal. Would definetly visit again. Restaurant on site does great food too. ",5,2014,01,23
219,"Good value, clean rooms","Great location, good value, comfortable, clean rooms, if somewhat lacking in atmosphere. Room was on street level, but slept fine. Staff were very nice and helpful. Would stay in the hotel again - great budget option.",4,2014,01,23
219,Top class from start to finish.,Top class from start to finish. Staff were fantastic in every way. Central to every thing in Dublin. Hotel clean .and tidy. Food very good. Irish breakfast is outstanding. Guinness has to be some of the best I have ever had. ,5,2014,01,23
219,Travelled by train with 3 others from Belfast,"Ideal for a short stay in Dublin, excellently placed next to the train station. Breakfast is good value, good selection of both hot & cold food.  Bathroom is clean but old, perhaps a re-vamp is overdue in the older rooms, didnt stay in a suite but a ""family"" room which had one double and 2 single beds.  Parking is extra.  Would stay again.",4,2014,01,22
219,Close to Luas & Connoly Train station,"The paddy wagon, noted on the hotel's website, was hard to locate at the coach stop, so we took the bus.  The bus driver dropped us off and directed us to the hotel location which was only a few steps.  However, it took us some time to find the entrance to the hotel because the miniscule sign was covered by renovation apparatus.  We finally found the entrance after going up and down the street and decided to peep into and under a lateral ladder.  The lady at the reception named Maria was nice and did her best to get us into our room although we were very early check-in time.

The room was small but comfortable.  It had 1 twin bed and 1 full size bed, instead of just two twin beds.  The sheets were fresh and clean.  The bathroom has the typical European tub that is very deep and not elderly friendly to step into. It is a little bit tight even for petite individuals.The hotel has good exercise facility with several machines.

The location is great since it is just across from the Connoly train station and walking distance to Luas.   There are a variety of restaurants within walking distance to the hotel.",3,2014,01,22
219,North Star,"Stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate husbands 50th in Dublin with friends.  Price paid for hotel was fair for the accommodation.  Rooms were not the ones the online agent we booked with were showing in their pics, which was a little disappointing but they were adequate.  We were situated at back of hotel next to the railway, however the trains didnt actually really bother us.  Our room didnt have flat screen tv but our friends room did, however limited channels.  Staff very very friendly and attentive - BUT I had 'liked' this hotels page on FB and mentioned it was my husbands 50th more than once and we also mentioned it again in the restaurant, but there was no recognition of this during our stay.  Breakfast was lovely, included in our price we had booked for and again staff couldnt do enough for us, especially Deidre.  Hotel stored our cases after we checked out until we needed to travel to airport, and lunch before we left was really nice.  However the evening Saturday meal, we thought, was expensive for what it was.  The hotel is situated about a 15 min walk from the heart of Dublins Temple Bar area and although other people have said its in a rather rough area of the City we were not fazed by this.",3,2014,01,20
219,Ticked the boxes.,"This is a 3 star hotel and for the price I paid it was a good one night stop over. Staff were friendly and professional. Room was okay, no flat screen tv and limited channels but bed comfortable. The bathroom needs some resealing around the bath(room 260) to tidy it up.
Breakfast was good and I had a really nice evening meal in the restaurant and waited on by excellent staff. Fine 3 star hotel.",4,2014,01,18
219,colin newtownabbey.,"excellent hotel ,car parking very handy as attendant parked car and had it sitting ready for us to drive away, didnt know it was so close to connelly station will travel by train next time just to cut out the long drive.have already told friends who have free travel passes about excellent location.",5,2014,01,17
219,Dublin Experience,"I was in Dublin to see a show at The O2 Arena and needed a hotel for the night, a friend of mine recommended The North Star as it was easy to get to from the airport, was central for the shops and to get to The O2. The hotel staff were very knowledgeable of the area and how to get to places, nothing was too much for them. I had such a good time that I plan on returning next year for a long weekend and stay at the hotel again. The breakfast was very good, plenty of choice and the bar/restaurant offered a very good food.",4,2014,01,17
219,A great hotel and great location!,"The hotel was lovely, the minute we went into the hotel they where so friendly! The location is brilliant a walk away from town centre!!!! Going back to this hotel again in feb! Can't wait. The bedrooms are nice but basic, however very clean. The value for money is great, the resturatant food was lovely and we eat there 2 nights out of 3!! ",5,2014,01,17
219,Dublin Christmas,"Thanks a lot North Star Hotel!
We enjoy to stay 6 nights and everything was fine.
Internet connection available, Breakfast excellent, reception and personnel completely friendly and always available for guests.
I will repeat it in near future.

219,Nice hotell with nice staff.?,"Nice hotell with nice staff. I like the style and they have a good resturant in the 1.floor. Lounge for realaxing and nice rooms. Only thing to remember is that the hotell is 5-10 min from center, and rhe train is going outside the window on one side if the hotell. So ask for the ""right"" side. But it was a good stay. Breakfast is expensive. 12‚Ç¨. Half price any place else. ",4,2014,01,17
219,North Star Dublin Hotel,"We had an enjoyable stay at this hotel.    The parking was a little hard to figure out when we arrived, but that was handled nicely and we enjoyed our stay.    The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating to us when we booked a dinner show with them for an evening of our stay.  They delivered the tickets to us just as promised (to our room actually).   We were there around the Christmas holidays and loved the location of the hotel as we were right in town to enjoy the season and observe the street decorations as we walked thru town.      We would stay there again without hesitation.   The breakfasts were very good and the adjoining restaurant/bar offered very good food.",4,2014,01,16
219,Complete affordable luxury,"Brilliant hotel, friendly staff amazing breakfast. Stayed there for New Year's Eve and the staff in the bar were more than happy to accommodate us even when we got back very late after a skinful. Rooms weds immaculate and we had a maid service everyday.",5,2014,01,16
219,Fab little hotel!,"Fantastic little hotel, staff were lovely as was food!! The bar was very nice and in an excellent location. Would recommend to friends and family and will be staying again on return to Dublin. Very clean modern and stylish hotel!",5,2014,01,16
219,Great People and Service,"While the North Star is right across from the rail station you wouldn't know it, the place was very quiet.  It's layout is somewhat odd as they have expanded into connecting buildings beyond the original, however, this is of little consequence with the exception of having to carry your own bags up some stair IF you choose too.  Not a big deal.  The concierge desk was MOST helpful as was the front desk staff.  Don't skip the in house restaurant, it is well worth a try, we went back more than twice.",5,2014,01,16
219,Great value for money,"I stayed at the North Star twice last year and would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Dublin. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable and staff always helpful. Just a short walk to city centre, would highly recommend.",4,2014,01,16
219,new year 3 night stay,"We enjoyed a 3 night stay over the New Year period. The welcome was great and room very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Tea and coffee etc + decent hairdryer and iron and board all in room. Lighting in bathroom could be better (for applying make-up) and would have liked decaf coffee option in the room. Staff exceptionally friendly and bar staff very smart and efficient. 
The breakfast was buffet style, very tasty with waitress bringing tea/coffee - again staff very efficient and friendly. 
The town is a little walk but not a problem unless raining! The bus from the airport stops very close to the hotel which was great. 
We visited the Guinness storehouse (ticket price includes a free pint!), Temple Bar, St Patricks,  the famine memorial, and Trinity College (unfortunately the castle was shut).The ambience on New Year Eve was friendly and relaxed - even in the lively Temple Bar area. Loved all the live music. 
Would like to visit Dublin again.",4,2014,01,14
219,Very bad experience,"HI had a very bad experience with this hotel
they charge for wifi but the wifi network did not work on my level room ( that was located on first floor, room was decorated with what looked like 2nd hand furniture) 
after several complains on the wireless work ( considering I was paying for it) the hotel gave me another room on a superior level ( room was up graded, very nice size rooms, brand new and very fashionable with a very good wireless connection) 
it was a shame that i has to experience the bad of the hotel to get the best out of it so if you are booking make sure you ask for a up-grade room ( superior) otherwise it will be a disapoointment 
location is close to teh center, right in front of a train station but no noise can be heard so ok",2,2014,01,13
219,Good Clean Rooms but not for the Disabled,"We enjoyed a night in Dublin over the Christmas break at this hotel. The rooms were clean and comfy and staff friendly. However, at no point were we asked whether we wanted a smoking room. We absolutely don't and surely in this day and age the default should be 'non smoking'?

The hotel has been recently refurbished but unfortunately the lift does not reach the ground floor, so anyone who is less able to carry heavy luggage will struggle or require help. This seems a surprising omission for a 'four star' hotel.",3,2014,01,10
219,the north star hotel,we went the day before new year and new years eve  as soon as we walked in we got a free upgade the room which was fab it was spotless everything  was there tea coffee and nice toiletries we had a meal on new year which was very very good cant fault it the only fault was it was a good walk into town but it didn't spoil anything all in all very good,4,2014,01,09
219,Show Deal Exstravaganza,"What can I say? Fantastic service, beautiful room and a fantastic show deal. Customer service on arrival and during our stay was excellent, room was available immediately. The Room was spotless and I loved the decor. Tea and coffee facilities fully stocked. Toiletries supplied, beautiful bathroom and shower and a tv that worked with a fully functional remote control. That doesn't happen very often. The evening meal was part of the deal and was cooked to perfection, served just how I'd asked - I'm a fussy eater. The service from all staff was faultless. The manageress was especially lovely. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name. She made time to chat in the bar that evening and at breakfast the following morning. All you can eat breakfast buffet and tea and coffee served to the table. There was a convention on and as there was a large group of guests the hotel moved them to the breakfast room on the lower floor, away from the residence bar to avoid disturbance to the other guests. What more could you ask for. Will definately make a point of staying here again. ",5,2014,01,08
219,Had a great stay.,"Convenient location with easy taxi rides to anywhere in Dublin. 
The room was really nice, cleaned and restocked daily by attentive staff.
Any hotel is judged and rated, more than anything else IMHO, by the service delivered by it's employees. The North Star are lucky to have some of the best bar staff in Dublin. In particular Shaun, Keith and Paddy made our stay terrific.
Will be back next year.

",5,2014,01,07
219,Re-visit,"My partner and I made a visit to this hotel, as we stayed here 3 years ago..It has been refurbished to the point that there is very little drinking area where you feel at home, as we could the last time we came here, outside of the rear of the bar used to be an area which was open in area's so you could sit and have a drink and a ciggy if you wish..  now they have changed this so if you smoke you have to cower into a corner of a little alleyway type area, so if it rains you get wet..   The hotel bar is mainly now an eating restaurant with new seating, the older type settle  seats have gone which were very comfortable...  I think perhaps our booking into here again has gone by the board... shame.",3,2014,01,07
219,Exceeded all expectations!,"I have recently returned home from a 2 night stay in this hotel and it really did exceed all expectations! 

On arrival into Dublin, we caught the Dublin airlink bus from the airport to O'Connell Street, which, when you get off at this stop, it is just around the corner from the hotel! This was very handy as it only cost 10‚Ç¨ for an open return.

When we arrived at the hotel, it was only 11am due to flying early in the morning, we asked the receptionist if there was a chance that we could check in then. The staff were very helpful and we were upgraded to a suite after originally booking a standard double room!

The suite was spacious with a comfy bed and nice interior, the suite had a large bathroom with bath and shower facilities. However, the room did have two TVs, both of which did not retrieve much of/if any signal, this didn't bother us too much though as we didn't intend on watching it for long periods of time. 

The breakfast runs until 10am during the week and 11am on weekends and it was delicious! It was a full, hot Irish buffet breakfast (similar to an English breakfast with the exception of white pudding being served in addition) as well as including cheeses, fruit and cereals. Tea/coffee was offered to us after being seated by the polite member of staff. We were spoiled for choice!

The hotel is in a good location. About 10 - 15 minutes walk from Grafton Street and Temple Bar area. We found the city to be very compact and most sites within walking distance.

All in all, we had a very pleasant and comfortable stay in this cosy hotel and would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying here! ",5,2014,01,04
219,Mixed feelings about North Star Hotel in Dublin...,"We had a one night layover in Dublin on our way back home during our European trip and booked the North Star hotel just a few days prior.  The price of a room in this hotel is pretty affordable, however, it felt short on a few categories...

We bought the bus tickets from the airport to the hotel inside the airport (Airlink 747) and got dropped off about 3 minutes walk to the hotel (round trip for $10).  Note that the bus stop to go back to the airport is not at the same location and not at the main bus station either - be sure to ask several people to point you to the right direction.  Overall, it was in an easy access location especially if it's not your first time in Dublin.

Upon our arrival, we checked in at the front desk.  The reception staff was pretty friendly and welcoming, however, did not bother to ask for any of our travel documents.  Once we got the room key, they did not help with our luggage, which made our walk to the room harder since it was already a bit confusing.  The room itself was in a smaller size, equipped with older and very basic essentials.  We searched everywhere in the room and only found one small electronic outlet that is compatible with our phone charger in the bathroom (we even had an outlet converter that worked in Berlin but didn't work here either).  The showers water temperature was impossible to control - either too hot or too cold and wouldn't stop changing.  

Tripadvisor reviews for the hotel's restaurant was pretty sad, so we decided to have dinner at some much better restaurant nearby.  Dublin itself is a small city - we walked from the hotel to the Cathedral and back in about 2 hours and covered most of the main attractions easily.  

Not sure if our travel path would end up in Dublin again, but we probably will look into some other hotels for our next trip.",3,2014,01,03
219,Pleasantly surprised,"My husband stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago on a business trip and said it was ""ok""  so we were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived on an overnight trip to Dublin late December to find that the hotel was fully refurbished.  The reception staff were very friendly and efficient. The hotel decor is very modern and pretty.  The room was lovely, one double and one single bed  - even though it overlooked the carpark- very clean and warm and the bathroom was nice everything you would need, nice fluffy white towels.  There was plenty of storage space in the bedroom and tea/coffee making facilities.  
It did get a little bit noisy in the corridors during the night but we put that down to the busy Christmas season.  
Breakfast was very good - again staff very friendly and efficient.
Hotel bar is lovely - menu looked good but we didn't eat there.
Very centrally located, only about ten mins. walk to O'Connell St. and across from Connolly Station,
Will definitely return to this hotel and next time we'll probably dine here too. Very impressed!!",4,2014,01,02
219,A most enjoyable stay,"We stayed for three nights and had absolutely no issues with the hotel. The location was excellent,  just a short walk from O'connell street and the centre of dublin. The room was spacious and very comfortable, with a quality ensuite. The entire trip was enhanced by the excellent value for money; very good deals could be found online which easily made the hotel one of the best value for money in the center of dublin.",4,2014,01,01
219,Good Value for Money,"It's hard to fault this hotel when taking into consideration the rates for bed and breakfast that are available from various hotel booking sites.  It's the type of old-school hotel more usually found in Irish country towns than in bigger cities.  The walk from reception to the room can be a bit of a magical mystery tour depending on where your room is located.  The room itself was perfectly serviceable if a little old fashioned. But it was spotlessly clean, everything worked and the bed was very comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was good.  It's a good option if arriving into Connolly Train Station.  The surrounding area seems a bit dodgy but not an issue if not planning to go out at night or if returning to the hotel by taxi.",3,2013,12,31
219,Overnight sty in Dublin,"Just home from overnight stay in the North Star Hotel in Dublin city. For us, while the accommodation is always very important and this was a beautiful refurbished hotel, it's the staff who make our stay. The staff were super and very helpful, special mention to the staff in the restaurant, they were extremely helpful and attentive and friendly. The food was excellent and obviously cooked fresh. Any staff member we dealt with were  helpful, friendly and very pleasant. We will go back without hesitation",4,2013,12,30
219,christmas present,"Stayed here for a  weekend break with my wife , hotel is spotless , Staff are very helpful and polite and go all the way to making you feel very welcome . Bar food is excellent and i thought very good value for money with very quick service . Its a buffet breakfast and very nice with clean and tidy surroundings . We were so impressed we will be going back in the summer . The hotel is located opposite the train station going out of the main bustle of the city which is good if you want a good nights sleep . You dont notice any noise from the train station but it is a good ten minute walk to the main parts you will want to see in Dublin , but the bus stop is just on the corner of the hotel . I would recommend you get the tour bus pass on arrival at the airport and this gives you free transfers to your hotel and back to airport for 24 euros ! This is a hop on and off bus that goes all around the city to all the main attractions and is valid for 48 hours from the first time you use the card . Very good value for money as cabs are expensive .",5,2013,12,30
219,Great breakfast... lovely rooms,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night, we got a great deal online.
The breakfast is buffet style.. the best selection i've seen. Really enjoyed by both of us.
Room isn't that big.. nice bathroom. Ours overlooked the car park.. but for what we paid we were doing well. The receptionist who checked us in couldn't have been nicer. So helpful, checked us in early and let us leave our bags behind reception after check out.
We ate at the restaurant in the hotel (Mcgettigans Cookhouse and Bar) little bit pricey for what it was but we got a voucher for two free glasses of prosecco which went down well. The desserts were really nice.
Planning to go back for a few nights next month.",5,2013,12,29
219,Great hotel,North star hotel in Dublin has been renovated to a high standard.This is are third time staying at this hotel we got a free upgrade to a premier class room excellent.hotel is very central just around the corner from the train and dart station.,5,2013,12,27
219,"Great Location, Helpful staff","My daughter and I spent a pre Christmas five night break in Dublin at the North Star. Even though we appeared for check in before 7AM after a trans-Atlantic flight, the hotel receptionist was able to accomodate us and allow a very early check in. 
The room we were given was extremely large with two single beds and a large bathroom. Furnishings are plain but the TV is was a large flat screen. It faced the main street opposite the Railroad Station but because we kept the windows closed (it is winter, after all!), the traffic noise was not bad and we were able to sleep well.
After two nights, hotel management notified us that maintenance was required and asked if we would be willing to move to an executive room (upgrade) on a higher floor. We moved to a different wing of the hotel in a very quiet area to a room which was actually a bit smaller than the first but was spacious enough. The room was more updated and nicely furnished.
There is a concierge at the hotel who will book tours and give directions and advice. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is located about a 5-10 minute walk from O'Connell Street which is a main shopping street. It is 15 minutes or so from temple Bar. Very convenient.
All in all the hotel is an excellent choice for a good, comfortable stay in Dublin and I will stay there again on a future trip to Ireland.",4,2013,12,25
219,North Star Hotel (Dublin1) Rip off Parking,"My husband and I had the last overnight stay in this hotel during our eight day Irish vacation in mid-November. It was pre-booked by Great Discount Vacation. At around 11:30 am it took us an hour after entering Dublin to get to the hotel in the congested streets with numerous stoplights. Even with a GPS system it was easy to make wrong turns. 

To find actual entrance to the hotel was a little nerve racking. In mid-November the front of the hotel was obscured by scaffolding and the hotel name was not displayed. It was easy to miss the entrance and the gate.  If you drive very slow and keep looking on the left, you may be lucky to see from your car through the gate the sign ""Parking and Entrance"" but not the name ""North Star"". 

The business that operates the parking made me feel uneasy. We arrived at noon and were charged for parking before 2 pm and for overnight for a total of $14. There is no discount for North Star guests. I was refused a printed receipt. The North Star service desk does not want to talk about parking. They pretend that it is not their business and they do not want to have anything to do with it. Their main point is ""hotel does not have anything to do with parking because parking is operated by the different company."" For the last two years overnight parking was $7 (photo). But the hotel keeps publishing obsolete information on its website. The parking guy and the service desk personnel lied to my face.

Location. It is close to Connelly station with all possible kinds of public transportation to travel in and around Dublin and across the country. Talbot Street with Talbot Mall, Dunnes, Super Valu, Tesco; other shops, stores and eateries are also close.  It is a ten-minute walk to the ticket booths of the green and red hop on-hop off tour buses and the Temple Bar. It took one hour to walk around and see nearby architectural buildings such as the Customs House, the IFSC, the Convention Center, the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and the Gaiety Theatre.

The quite small size of the room and the bathroom is justified by the location in the capital of the country. The beds, pillows and blankets were comfortable. The room is clean and quiet. Everything is well thought out and space efficient. There is a safe for valuables for no extra charge. The lights were weak. It was impossible to study maps or to read in bed or do tourist planning. WiFi was picked up only in a couple of spots in the room and was slow. The fitness room is very big. A sauna (called a Scandinavian) is available. The fitness hours of operation are generous but not 24 hours. If you decide to stay at this mediocre hotel, be patient flushing the toilet - it may take a few attempts. At 12.50 euros the full Irish breakfast served in the hotel was the most expensive of all the hotels we stayed at in Ireland. See the photo of the dinner menu. 

On the way to the airport there are lots of gas stations where you can fuel your rental car before returning it.",2,2013,12,25
219,Central location with easy access to the train & bus depot!,"Lovely central hotel with fabulous restaurant attached, very helpful friendly staff with a delicious breakfast. Stayed here during a weekend theatre break, also within walking distance of shops and theatres.  Staff on hand to give recommendations of what to do, where to see in dublin. Couldn't fault the hotel, perfect!",5,2013,12,21
219,Fantastic Hotel,"Just back tonight from a 3 day stay at the North Star.  Situated a 10 minute walk from the heart of shopping.   A fantastic hotel and extremely clean.  Rooms were spacious with a comfy bed.  The trains can be heard but noise is nothing and they don't run during the night.  From the moment we arrived to departure the staff throughout the hotel were courteous, helpful and cheery.  If you needed advice or direction they gave the simple solution.
Breakfast was what you would 5+star a great selection of juices cereals and cooked breakfasts. If you just wanted a continental toast croissants were plentiful.
Even the transfer from Airport to Hotel by Paddy Wagon was 1st class.
A great hotel and would recommend.",5,2013,12,20
219,Fantastic hotel! ,"I stayed at your hotel last weekend and cannot compliment ye enough! The staff are super friendly in this hotel! We were delighted when we got upgraded to a suite free of charge! It wAs amazing! The room was spacious, comfy and moderne! Will Defiently be returning and will 100% recommend this hotel to friends and family! Keep up the good work!! X",5,2013,12,16
219,very nice hotel,"Just returned from a 2 night break at this centrally located hotel. The room was nicely decorated, was very clean, was spacious and had comfy beds. The staff were pleasant, breakfast was tasty and it was all well placed to the city centre. We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel at 8.30 am hoping to drop off our bags but in fact we were allowed to check in which was very welcome as we were very tired and were able to have a short power nap before exploring the city :0)  

So thank you for a nice stay!!!",5,2013,12,14
219,Amazing hotel,"I stayed at this hotel with my parents and it was just amazing from start to finish. The rooms were superb, spacious, and had the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. McGettigans Cookhouse was great. The food was delicious, the ambiance perfect, and the staff very friendly. They also have a beautiful outdoor garden which was also lovely.
The breakfast was fantastic. The food was so fresh and there was so much of it. The best breakfast in Dublin! Location is perfect....only a few minutes walk from O'Connell street.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and I already have a few friends booked in to stay.
Thank you nice again for a fantastic stay!!",5,2013,12,13
219,Pleasantly surprised.,"I stayed here for one night with my wife. It was booked at the last minute and it was just somewhere to put our heads down for the night.

I heard some very mixed reports about this hotel but I can't fault it really. Rooms are basic but very clean (there is an upgrade to better rooms for around ‚Ç¨30) and the bar and foyer was very nice.

Hotel was warm and comfortable and staff were friendly. I had a few drinks in the bar on my own early in the day and the bar staff were a good laugh.

I hadn't expected a lot from the hotel but I think the bad reports I'd heard were from years ago.I would definitely stay again.",4,2013,12,04
219,Spacious room,"We were on the 6th floor. The elevator was creepy and I often thought it wasnt going to make it. They are also located in a odd spot that was a hike for several older people with luggage. 
The room was nice and spacious with a step in tub and shower (very nice for europe). 
Bed was super comfy!
Breakfast was good but wish it was included or monitored several people said they were ""continental"" but then ate off the hot bar. Why did I pay for the extra??",3,2013,12,02
219,Wonderful service,"We have just returned from an overnight stay at the North Star in Dublin. From the minute we arrived the entire team were helpful, friendly and we got a free room upgrade to the seventh floor with balcony. This is the third time we have stayed here as we go to concerts and the theatre and I can honestly say I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else! It's location is perfect if you want to go anywhere in Dublin, Connolly station is opposite, as is a taxi rank and the concierge will happily give u walking directions to anywhere. The newly refurbished Mc Gettigans bar is wonderful, and their food is Devine and reasonably priced. This hotel in my eyes is a gem . Beds we're comfy, room spotless and staff always smiling.... Looking forward to our next trip.",5,2013,12,01
219,Night in Dublin to see BZ20 @ the 02.,"Never stayed here before got a great deal with this hotel on booking.com We got the Luas direct to the hotel across the road from the hotel. We went into reception, meet a lovely girl, I think her name was Maria. She informed me that we got an up grade for our stay. I love a free up grade. We were put on the 6th floor. Balcony view of the Luas station. Adjoining to next room. Ashes outside the sliding door. The temp stats could not be adjusted the room was too hot temp stat was loose and coming away from the wall. The shower glass was not very secure the water leaked every where when we showered. Not enough lighting in the Bathroom for shaving. During the night the water kept flowing in the toilet we even closed the door and still could hear the water. The walls were like paper we could hear next door people walking up down the floor. The wall sockets under the TV very loose. No RTE 2 picture FROZEN could not be watched.  We had dinner in the restaurant, too much of a wait between courses. chips were hard under cooked. We found the hotel central but that was it. We could hear the Luas when it was running. No sound proof in the room. Hotel interior dark. Staff friendly.",3,2013,11,30
219,beautiful hotel experience,"we stayed at north star only one night (nov 18, 2013) but it was a great experience.  our first trip to Ireland and we had no idea what to expect.  we arrived at 8 AM from the airport with the hope that we could leave our luggage until check-in time later and go get breakfast and sightsee.  The staff said they would have our room ready in an hour - WOW !!!!  the room was great, comfortable, spotless bathroom and a great mix of old dark woods and modern convenience.  beyond anything I expected.   Hotel is convenient to bus and train service and there are plenty of shops and cafes in the walking area.",5,2013,11,30
219,Lovely!,Right in the center of town near everything. The staff are lovely and helped us with directions. The room was lovely and warm and the bed was comfy! The breakfast was yummy and filling! The creme brule dessert was so nice i would go back just for that! i would stay here again The goats cheese salad was tiny though so i wouldn't get that again. The decor is posh and up to date.,5,2013,11,29
219,Unexpected service....,"Ok,you expect a certain level of service from a 3 star hotel....... But this hotel , blows that to smithereens,!
On arrival we were greeted by one of the nicest and accommodating receptionists we have ever
Encountered in our years of travelling, Maria, we arrived early in the morning ,we were tired, she explained that she would get us into our room ASAP.. Although , the official checking in time was 2.30pm,  true to her word and after a cup of tea ,served to us by the concierge,, to help us get over our long flight, and to keep us, fighting fit!, in his words, our room became ready,
After our 8 hr flight we sunk into a very comfortable bed , in a very nice room on the 6th floor.
After a few hours we awoke and decided to check out dublin city,
We got down to reception , and Ciaran ,the concierge , greeted us with a huge smile and asked how we were feeling now.?
He very kindly gave us the run down on dublin, where to go, suggested restaurants, ""the one in the hotel, is one of the best on the north side of dublin"", and some other good restaurants on the south side of the river Liffey ,he also suggested some tours to do, the big red bus hop/on/off, and the fishing village of howth I personally recommend, 
Later that evening we arrived back to the hotel, had the fish and chips , as recommended, delicious!
The bar has an excellent whiskey menu, and we partook , Sean the batman is very knowledgeable on his whiskeys, and paddy is a character of note
This hotel would give some 5 star establishments a run for their money, but without the price tag,
The next day we went to the cliffs of mother, organised by Ciaran , they are wonderful, but a 3hr trip across Ireland one way, with it , but you need the following day to recover!
So to summarise
Great service
Great rooms
Good food
Fine whiskey
People who care
Book it !",5,2013,11,27
219,Superb Hotel,"Just returned from a fabulous weekend at this most welcome hotel,everything was excellent,nice big bedroom on the fifth floor,this hotel is right on the railway line at the station and I was rather worried we would be disturbed by the noise,but we hardly heard a thing and had a good nights sleep in a very big comfy bed.The staff at this hotel could not have been more helpful and friendly,a very nice young man from Argentina on reception,quickly printed out our boarding passes,with no extra cost,I have stayed at hotels before where we have had to pay for this service.The breakfast in the morning is excellent,everything you could want for a truly good Irish breakfast,my partner and I love a good breakfast as it sets us up for the day,and you will most certainly get that here.We never had dinner in the restaurant in the evening as we ate out, but I spoke to other guests who did and enjoyed it very much.
The hotel is in a good location to explore the city,we walked everywhere even to the Guinness brewery,well worth a visit,we will most certainly visit Dublin again and stay at the North Star.",5,2013,11,25
219,"Very Nice Hotel, Great Location","Arrived last Thursday, 21st November, 2013.

Excellent service from all staff.

Food was very good.

Rooms very clean and spacious.

Superb value.

Bed was simply superb will memory foam mattress.

Would recommend it for singles, couples and family stays.",4,2013,11,25
219,A nice hotel is nothing without nice staff,We booked this hotel for 1 night as we had a grappling competition nearby. These occur every couple of months but it was our first time staying in the north star. The rooms were nice nothing special but you get what you pay for. We spent no more than 5 minutes in the hotel when we arrived simply checked ourselves in and left because we were on a tight schedule. When we returned later that night the manager on duty began giving out to us saying there was many complaints about our noise level. When we explained how we weren't even present in the hotel at the time. He simply shrugged offering no apology or explanation. Also one of our members booked a double room for himself but when his partner decided to stay last minute we asked could she stay in the double room and we would pay the balance. Not only did he decline but his demeanor and attitude was so aggressive and uncourteous it makes you think how he ever obtained the position of a manager in the first place. If your looking for a warm atmosphere with nice staff this isn't the hotel for you but if your just looking for a bed to sleep in then why not.,1,2013,11,24
219,Enjoyed our stay,"The rooms are a good size and very quiet. They have an excellent, bar, bistro and restaurant with a dedicated separate guest lounge. Good location as it is within easy walking distance of the city centre and across the road from Connolly Station, taxi rank, bus and light rail station. They also provide an Airport Shuttle service at 5 Euro per person. There are a few negatives. A full flight of stairs before you can access the lifts. Reception is happy to help with luggage whenever asked. Often there are smokers in the entrance doorway escaping the cold and wind. Overall an enjoyable stay.",4,2013,11,24
219,Back to another time the right way!!!,"On November 11th, 2013, my companion and I went to Dublin Ireland on an Aer Lingus Vacation package (FANTASTIC BEYOND WORDS for 7 days). The Hotel we were booked into is the North Star Premiere Suites. It is an older Hotel, which is being remodeled, but in the best sort of way, they are keeping it old~style, which I liked very much. The Hotel reminded me of everything I wanted Ireland to be (Oscar Wilde). It is centrally located, just across from the Redline Train Station, and just around the Corner from the Bus Station and just a few Blocks from the Quay along the River Lee (there is some train noise, but it's part of the experience and was never TOO noisy). Inside the Hotel, the lobby is full of places to sit and lounge, and Concierge is very available for all and any help one requires, a winding staircase leads to the ""lifts"". The Desk is always staffed with courteous knowledgeable staff. The entry to the Hotel is secure 360 degree's requiring room keys to enter. There are plenty of rooms in which to sit back and read a paper or just relax. It has an outstanding FULL IRISH BREAKFAST buffet that is better than any I've encountered in the States (even though I brought Mexican Cholula Hot Sauce). Staff are eager to help and not expecting a tip, in fact reluctant to accept gratuity. It was, to me like a trip back to the 40's that I had seen in movies as a child. There is also a restaurant and Pub onsite and a conversation with Barman ""Paddy"" is an experience not to be missed. I just cannot say too many nice things about this place. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be immersed in what Dublin has to offer, and that is quite a lot. Thanks North Star and Aer Lingus Vacations.",5,2013,11,24
219,well run hotel,had a short stay recently while working in dublin well run hotel very pleasant staff exelent choice of food in the bar worth checking out the location of the hotel is ideal close to train and bus stations and the centre of dublin is only a short stroll,5,2013,11,24
219,Avoid not worth being treated like crap,"I have never seen staff in a hotel so ignorant. Excluding cleaning staff who were friendly reception and everyone else act as if they are a class above you. Not friendly or accommodating. I have stayed in hotels in Miami, Las Vegas, Lisbon and even other hotels on Ireland and never seen the likes of it.",1,2013,11,23
219,Really handy,"My wife and I spent a very enjoyable two nights at this hotel in November 2013 and found that it was a really nice hotel, we had written to the hotel in advance and asked for a room in the part of the hotel furthermost from the station to avoid noise and although I never received a reply we were indeed in this part of the hotel .
The hotel was in a really great location and handy for the station for  trip to Howth and a short walk to some great bars.

Breakfast was great too with a warm and cold buffet available.

I would go back again given the chance.",4,2013,11,22
219,Brilliant Hotel,"Booked this hotel for a two night stay with my mum on 18th November. Previously been to Ireland and stopped at Jury's inn. We arrived at the hotel around 0845 hrs, spoke to reception, hoping to leave our bags until we were able to check in. We were more than surprised that the receptionist told us we could have our room. The hotel was lovely, all staff were friendly and courteous . We booked into the restaurant for our first evening meal and received a complimentary glass of prosecco . The breakfast was plentiful and tasty . Some reviews have said they felt the hotel was in a bad area, I didn't find this to be the case. The hotel was across the road from Connelly st station, it was easy to walk yo Grafton Street & Temple Bar.  The hotel transfer on the PaddyWagon was also good 5 euros each way and very convenient. First class hotel and good location, excellent value for money and I would definitely visit again. ",5,2013,11,21
219,Lovely Hoel in an Ugly Neighborhood,"Booked a four day Dublin escape through Aer Lingus for myself, a cousin and aunt. Our rooms were at the North Star just across from Connolly Station. We took a shuttle and though we arrived very early the hotel checked us in. The rooms were clean and comfortable but plain. The maid service was exceptional, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The concierge was extremely knowledgeable. The pub downstairs was nice, too, and on the night I arrived I had a pleasant drink and a chat with the bartender. 
But there was a soccer match that weekend and things changed once the hooligans came out. O'Connell street is about a five-block walk, and most of the area we covered was very shabby and littered with trash. I did not feel endangered, but I don't think I would have walked around the neighborhood alone.  If the hotel were anywhere else, I would eagerly return. I probably still would if I were traveling with someone, but not traveling alone.",4,2013,11,20
219,otchris,"Just spent the weekend in this hotel. Very comfortable bed, hot shower, efficient and friendly staff, wonderful breakfast, Good location. Looks a bit tatty from outside as being refurbished but dont be put off. We really liked the communal lounge areas , great for late night chatting with friends, some good local pubs if you dont want to walk too far and local shop next door, Overall very good value for money.",4,2013,11,19
219,don't judge a book by its cover,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at the North Star Hotel for a total of 3nights (15-18th October) Prior to the visit I had read various reviews of the hotel and had my reservations.  On a arrival we were both pleasantly surprised with the standard of the hotel.  The room was clean and spacious and the overall standard of the hotel was excellent.  We ate in the restaurant of the Saturday night and we were both really pleased with the meal.  The staff were friendly and approachable.  The only downside of the stay was the walls of the hotel appear very thin and every door slamming and noisy guest could be heard.  This only effected me one night of our stay and my boyfriend slept through this so this could be down to being a light sleeper.  At the minute the hotel is having works done on the exterior of the building....don't judge a book by its cover as the interior really makes up for this.  I booked the hotel through travel republic and paid just over ¬£40 a night for two people, at this price you cant complain.  The hotel is a good location and has excellent bus and tram links near by.  I wouldn't necessary write a review after an enjoyable stay, however I feel this hotel deserves some recognition",4,2013,11,19
219,Good Hotel,"The hotel is well situated, and easy to access the main areas, being only 10mins walk north of Talbot street to O'Connell street. I stayed at the hotel 15th - 17th October. I stayed in room 102, and whilst a lovely room it was very noisy. Mostly because it was situated close to the entrance door, which would probably benefit from a quiet closing mechanism. The room may also benefit from secondary glazing to cut down on the noise from the road outside.
I initially phoned to order room service on the Saturday night, and was not called back for 20mins. I then decided to go to the hotel restaurant. The hotel restaurant on the ground floor was very busy , and this showed by the slow service, and having to wait 15mins before my order was taken. The waiter was very apologetic and the meal was okay. 
Got back late to the hotel on the Saturday night, and was asked by a man smoking outside the hotel, what room I was in. I did not initially answer, as he did not identify himself. I asked who he was, and he said he was the night security man. I asked for his ID, which he then produced from inside his inner pocket (Waqar) would suggest that this approach needs to be looked at. As I pointed out he could have been any random man standing outside the hotel that night. 
The hotel is pleasant enough.
Of note is the young lady working in the ground floor restaurant on the Saturday night, who was very professional and attentive.",4,2013,11,18
219,Great location & service but terrible sleep!,"Just back from 2 nights at this hotel. Overall a decent hotel which was around 20 mins walk to Temple Bar area and 10 mins from O'Connell Street. Excellent breakfast choice and hotel is certainly 4 star in its decor & cleanliness. The downsides were that our room - 357 - was right next to the railway track, the corridor stunk of smoke (and therefore so did our room...there didn't seem to be an option of a non-smoking floor) and the beds were the lumpiest, most uncomfortable beds I've ever slept in! If u get offered this room - ask to be moved!!",3,2013,11,18
219,Great hotel!,"Stayed at the North Star for just one night in a standard room. The service on reception was very friendly and efficient. Our room was spotlessly clean, modern and well equipped and available to us before the official check in time. The bar area of reception was again clean and the staff were very friendly and clearly enjoyed their work. The outdoor area of the bar was very pleasant, even on a november evening, situated under one of the railway arches with heating and lounge style furniture. Bar prices very reasonable ( for Dublin!). Didn't use the restaurant personally but others in our group did and had no complaints. Would be nice for breakfast to be included given the price of accomodation. The one down side to the hotel is its location, whilst it is central and very accessible be aware that a railway line passes through the middle of the hotel separating the two blocks of accommodation so noise may be an issue. Also, as with most cities in the world the area around the main railway station is not the most pleasant! Overall though very happy with the hotel and would stay here again when visiting Dublin next.",5,2013,11,18
219,"Old fashioned room, shocking restaurant staff","Pics on site are deceiving- obv of the premier suites. In room 262- v old fashioned wooden decor and old tv ( no flat screen). Bed has a dip in it and sheets are cheap and itchy. Crap shower not very hot or powerful. Only good thing is wifi.
The staff in mc gettigand really let it down they just wander around without attending to anyone I waited 10 mins for butter for my bread by the time the guy got it I had my main! The food is very good there though. 
Would never stay here again noisey enough with trains only booked here cos gibson was booked out :/
",3,2013,11,18
219,Lovely Hotel - Will Be Back,"On arrival at the hotel it didnt look much from the outside, just goes to show appearances can be deceptive.  A lovely hotel - staff very warm, friendly and welcoming.   We arrived early (8 am) but leaving the luggage was not a problem and allowed us to go and explore the area.  Room was lovely, spotlessly clean and spacious.  There was a slight problem with the toilet seat but this was fixed within 10 minutes of mentioning it to staff - very impressive.  Food in restaurant was lovely and the breakfast was fantastic - plenty of choice and something for everyone.  Thoroughly enjoyed my first trip to Dublin and would most definitely stay in this hotel again. Its very central and they also run a shuttle bus to and from the airport which cost 6 euro each - a lot cheaper than the taxi we got on arrival to take us to hotel - 38 euro!",5,2013,11,17
219,Traditional yet modern,"Selected this hotel for a number of reasons including cost and location as we wanted something not too expensive and not that far away from the centre. I was not disappointed.  The Hotel is about 15 mins walk from the Temple Bar and 2 mins walk from train, tram and bus connections so really we'll placed. The entrance is a very traditional colonial style building with public areas to match, once through this area there is a modern extension at the back where most of the rooms are. The rooms were nicely appointed and clean and tidy, we had very comfort beds. The bathroom needed a little TLC but was also clean and tidy with complementary shower gel soap etc, really handy for those travelling light and not wanting to carry liquids through the airport.  Tea and coffee facilities are also included.  As we were on a budget I'd booked the least cost room option so wasn't too surprised when we were in the very back of the hotel. The only down side was noise from outside, but then you are in a big city, don't get me wrong there isn't a lot but drunken revellers at 3 am can be disruptive. 

The food offering at breakfast was very good, all you can eat for 12.50 euros seems a good deal. The food was hot and the eggs nicely cooked, not dried out as they often are in buffet type breakfasts. 

There are lifts to all floors but you do have to walk up at least half a flight of stairs to reach them so not too good for the less able. 

Staff we met were all friendly and helpful.  Would I stay again? A big fat loving YES.",4,2013,11,17
219,"Nice Hotel, Bad Parking","Difficult to find (maybe due to construction).Parking was awful...the lot attendant seemed a bit shady. No washclothes in the room. Odd set up in getting to the elevator (lift)... had to go upstairs to get to the elevator (odd). Bar and restaurant staff were friendly, food was ok. Key card didn't work at first, and someone was in the room working on a safe when we arrived, so we had to stand in the hallway and wait. I don't know, just didn't strike me as anything spectacular, just ok.",3,2013,11,16
219,"Good hotel, excellent hotel staff, shame about the female restaurant staff!!","Stayed here for a weekend with friends, first time in Dublin and had an amazing time.  The hotel is not too far (10 - 15 mins walking from the temple bar area) or 5 mins on the bus....which we used regularly as we had the 3 day hopper ticket.  

We arrived at 9 am and the rooms were not ready (which we expected), but they did have a room where we could leave our luggage, which we were happy to do.  

We returned at 2.15....(check in 2 o'clock) to be told one of ours rooms was not ready and they could not tell us when it would be!!  Not impressed by this, but we decided to go into the bar and have a drink, returning half an hour later, our room was still not ready, but would be by the time we checked in!!!!!  Why say check in at 2 if rooms are not available then?  The house keeper was quick enough to be chasing guests out their rooms at half 11 on their check out day!!

We had booked 2 twin rooms and I had emailed in advance asking for 2 quiet rooms.....we got one quiet room and one back to back with the train station, but in error the hotel staff had given us a family room, so we were quite happy to put up with the noise rather than downsize to a smaller room.  I note previous reviews going on about the train noises all night....we never had this problem at night, there were no trains running when we got in and they started in the morning about 8 am.....which is really not too bad.  

The rooms were clean, spacious and well decorated.  Shampoo/shower gel/soap/moisturiser/toilet roll was replenished daily if any were used, as were towels.  The only down side of the rooms was the heat, it was unbearable, even with the thermostat in the room turned off, it was horrendous.  

The main reception area of the hotel is stunning with comfortable chairs where you get good wifi access.....we had no wifi in our room (457).

On our 2nd night we had a meal in the restaurant which was an absolute joke!!!!  We were seated and given menus, by a female who I can only presume was the manageress (very slim girl with long hair), both her and the young female waitress who came to serve us initially were absolutely useless (had I been the owner in this restaurant both would be out the door jobless forthwith).  It took 20 minutes for us to get them to come over and take a drinks order (which they mucked up) then another 15 for our meal order to be taken.  Three of us ordered starters with a side of fries, and one main course was ordered, we emphasised we wanted these all together.  The starters sat on the pass for 10 minutes with both females walking about doing absolutely nothing ignoring these!  We shouted over a male waiter and pointed this out to him and he kindly obliged and served these, we then had to ask for the chips and the main that had been ordered.  The young girl who had been waiting on the table then started arguing with the chef as to whether the starters, sides and mains were requested served at the same time by us or not.........she stood glaring at the chef and walked away whilst he was talking to her....totally pig ignorant.  We had to ask 3 times for the bill and when it came we were charged for drinks we never had!.....this was eventually rectified after 10 minutes of discussions between the waitress and waiter.  

We drank in the bar a couple of times before going out or on our way to our rooms, the drinks were no more expensive than they were anywhere else.  

Breakfast was lovely with plenty to choose from, but some staff again, seemed as if they ""couldn't be bothered to be there"".  On our second morning, 4 of us went down together for breakfast and were offered a table for 2!.......come on staff, wakey wakey.

Lovely boutique hotel, which I would definitely return to and would not let sullen, lazy staff put me off.  Given a very good and not excellent mark because of ignorant, lazy staff, the heat in the rooms and no wifi in room.",4,2013,11,13
219,Lovely hotel with Great Staff,"We stayed here for a long weekend and were amazing at how lovely the hotel was at the price.  The room was very spacious, nicely decorated and spotlessly clean.  The staff were all very welcoming and helpful (especially Paddy in the bar) and the breakfast was fantastic.  Our room was on the same side as the train line and even with the windows open we hardly noticed any noise - I always travel with earplugs but didn't need them at all.  The only negative I would say is that it a short walk out of town ‚Äì which in itself is not a problem at all ‚Äì but late at night the area felt quite unsafe and after walking back the first night and being accosted by various drunks we chose to get a taxi home the other nights to be safe.  Otherwise I would strongly recommend this hotel and Dublin in general.",4,2013,11,12
219,So comfortable in Dublin,"This was our first stop on our trip around Ireland and it was easily one of the top hotels we stayed in while in Ireland. We stayed here the night of October 5th.  As we were jet lagged in the morning, driving on a different side of the road (yea we're from America), it took us a couple wrong turns and 2 trips across the river Liffey before we turned into the tiny parking lot next to the North Star.  If you are driving into Dublin from the airport keep a sharp eye out for the train trestle bridge which the hotel is located on the right, immediately after on Amiens Street.  You have to pull into a small round arch which goes under the train tracks to park your car in. 

There is a very nice man there who works in a little white office in the lot who will give you a time-stamped ticket and will park your car for you.  They have to move your car around in order to fit as many cars in as possible as the lot is shared with a couple buildings, so you just have to hand over your keys and trust them.  The man who worked there actually tried to persuade us to park elsewhere as it would have been cheaper for us he told us due to when we arrived, but we didn't want to drive around anymore being as delirious as we were.  We only had to pay when we left the following day which was 12 Euros for us.  As long as you park there after 4pm it is only 8 Euros for a whole 24hrs which is very convenient. (It's 2 Euros per hour up until 4pm). You really don't need to drive when your in Dublin as it is much easier to walk, take a cab or hop on the Luas tram. We had to drive into the hotel though as we were driving around Ireland through more rural parts.

We wheeled our bags into the nice hotel lobby around 2pm and were quickly checked into beautiful room #668 on the 6th floor.  This is on the other wing of the hotel that you walk down a little corridor and into a much larger building behind the entrance on Ameins street.  Our room was very comfortable with an actual king bed, and very large walk-out balcony facing Croke Park Stadium.  The bed probably was one of the best things about this hotel as it was probably the most comfortable bed we slept on in our entire trip around Ireland.  Most hotels in Ireland don't seem to have king beds or just can't fit them in the rooms, but this hotel did and it was extremely comfortable. The balcony was really large as well and was very nice to hang out on and check out the street action below. Our room also had AC/Heat which I am sure makes a difference in the summer. The room was a good size with a large closet/safe for your things. My wife was able to use the hairdryer that came with the room which was nice for her. Everything was clean, modern, and looked pretty new inside.

This hotel is a very easy walk over to O'Connell street down Talbot street.  It was probably like 10 minutes walk over towards the Spire.  It is also very easy to walk down towards the ""Quays"", ""Bachelor's walk"", or towards Trinity College/Temple Bar.  Dublin is very walkable and it is very easy to get back and forth across the river quickly.  We also felt very safe walking around Dublin at night and safe when walking back to the hotel. We had heard stories about the north side of Dublin before we came, but it was quite the contrary to what I had heard from friends. My wife and I live in DC which can be much more sketchy to walk around in at night than it is in Dublin.  With any city though, as long as you use common sense when walking around at night you will be fine.  We slept like a couple rocks in our super comfortable bed, as the room & hotel were also quiet.  One other thing we noticed all over Ireland is that every hotel we stayed in does not use top sheets on their beds for some reason.  This seemed to be the case everywhere we went.  We keep looking for it then realizing it just wasn't there. Not really an issue, but just different than America/Canada.

The hotel also had a nice little bar/lounge area on the second floor there, but we didn't get to check it out due to our short stay.  We also received a nice continental breakfast in the morning that includes mainly the cold food (cereal, fruit, bread) which we accidentally ate the ""full"" breakfast (all the hot food).  The wait staff forgave us though and allowed us to continue.  We didn't realize we had assigned tables and a waitress for breakfast at first...oops.The breakfast buffet is really good and they had very tasty scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, blood pudding, beans, tea/coffee, etc...Quite a large spread. The Irish are serious when it comes to breakfast!

This was probably the most centrally located of any of the 3 Dublin hotels we stayed in as well.  The staff was very friendly and gave us excellent directions driving out of town to avoid the dreaded M50 tolls on the north side of the city the following day.  That was very helpful!  The staff was great. I would say overall this hotel is a great choice to stay in for comfort and location.  The rate was very reasonable in October as well. I will definitely be back to stay here next time we are in Dublin.",4,2013,11,11
219,Beautiful hotel,Driving in Dublin is quite difficult....especially when you are driving in circles to find the car park.  I do like the idea of having your car in secured parking.  The hotel is beautiful and very modern and clean.  We had dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and was VERY please with the food.  We had problems with keeping the Wi-Fi working and we didn't have heat that worked in the room.  The hotel staff did give as space heater to use.  The Premier lounge was really nice....great coffee machine.  The water pressure was great here unlike other hotels in Ireland.,4,2013,11,10
219,brilliant friendly family hotel,stayed here for one nite we were goin to the o2 for concert hotel was in a good location right across from the luas so easy to get around city center 2 stops  and we were right in middle of the shops staff couldnt have been nicer and more helpful esp simon in reception hotel was  modern and very clean rooms were lovely beds so comfy and fab shower breakfast was a really good buffet didnt eat in restaurant but looked really good just a brilliant hotel very reasonable 2 cant wait to go back and stay again,5,2013,11,08
219,Good hotel,"Great hotel, in a central location.  Well appointed room. Very good breakfast . Wonderful price... Had an enjoyable Irish Coffee in the bar in the evening. Valet car parking was good value at 8 euros. Only downside was the smell of cigarette smoke on the corridors on floor 3. We even had an ashtray in room 355!  I thought Eire had a non smoking policy in public places. Despite this I would be happy to stay again, but I would ask for a non smoking floor when booking next time.",4,2013,11,08
219,Good location and quality,"This hotel is a 10 minutes stroll away from Connely street, and 15 minutes from Trinity College or the Temple bar. If you need to go further away: it's right across the main train station and all local transport you need. 
Since it's a hotel with a long history the layout might seem confusing; especially the breakfast room wasn't easy to find. Breakfast itself however was fine, with very friendly staff. My room was modern with all I needed, although WIFI didn't work on my room (in the lobby no problem however). My room was situated close to the railway, but the noise didn't bother me at all (which can only partly be blamed on Guiness). All in all a hotel I can recommend for a nice weekend in Dublin. For cigar smokers; the hotel has a nice covered terrace!",4,2013,11,05
219,Convenient safe location,"Stayed two nights mid-trip booked through Rail Tours Ireland. Directly opposite the Connolly Train station (direct access to trains to Belfast and light rail in Dublin) and around the corner from Busiras (main bus station), the hotel offers convenience in a safe location. No matter where you want to go, you can get there from here. The actual layout of the hotel was odd - our only objection was to get to our room with luggage, we needed to use an outside entrance through the car park and walk the luggage up the handicap ramp (or you will have a few stairs to manage inside). The room itself was nice. We had a good size sitting area outside of the bathroom (a strange place to put a sitting area we thought but it worked OK). Bathroom facilities were fine. Would definitely return.",4,2013,11,05
219,Good Hotel in the centre of Dublin,"The North Star Hotel is situated in the Centre of Dublin.  There is a direct connecting with the Dublin Airport with the Airlink Bus.  The Dart railwaystation is on the other side off the road.  There is a good restaurant in the same building of the hotel.
We booked a family room and this room was nice.",3,2013,11,04
219,"Helpful staff, but not as good as we expected!","From the moment me and my partner walked into the hotel there was a sense of luxury. Even walking from the reception to the lifts you can tell a lot of money and hard work has been put into the hotel. However, it is a shame this feeling was not carried on into our room. After walking through the corridors of the hotel i felt i was somewhere completley different when i entered the hotel room. We where dissapointed after paying so much, and staying there for 4 nights. The beds where uncomfortable and the bathroom wasnt that nice. The shower wasnt very powerful and i cant say i would like to have had a bath in there either. We where on the fourth floor situated next to the train line. WHAT A NIGHTMARE!! Unfortunatley Irish Rail had decided to do maintenace works on that part of the rail line for the whole duration of our stay! Nuematic drills and hammering where going on non stop! For the first 2 nights we basically put up with it and had no sleep but on the  3rd night we just couldnt stand it any longer! I went to the reception (with my heart pounding away-i HATE complaining!) And explained that if possible we would like to change rooms. The staff where wonderful and although at one point i thought he was going to stay there was nothing he can do, after flicking through the computer for a while, we where finally given a room on the fifth floor on the other side of the hotel...away from the train line! 
What a difference one floor makes...just by going up one floor was a huge difference! The decor was much nicer and even the doors where better, solid wood! We where surprised that the room we had been given was actually a 'suite' room...it was AMAZING!! We finally felt like we was getting our moneys worth...just a shame we didnt feel this from the start.",4,2013,11,01
219,Ok stay,"We stayed only 1 night in this hotel. The room quality was of a 2 star. I am glad we only stayed here 1 night. Parking is 8 euros, which i won't mind paying. The location is great, close to most attractions. But the hotel is on a busy street and was very noisy at night.",3,2013,10,31
219,Lovely stay,"We stayed here with our 5month old son mid October and were extremely happy with this hotel. The staff and services were very accommodating. We especially liked the on site parking, which wasn't too expensive at all at just 8euro a night, and the carpark was constantly manned by member of staff.
The rooms were lovely and comfortable, as were the beds. We were even supplied a travel cot on request aswell as a quiet part of the hotel to accommodate our son. Breakfast was tasty, with an array of food on the buffet to cater everyone's needs and tastes.although it was an extra 12euro but i must say well worth it for convenience sake aswell as how good it was.
It's also situated close to the city centre, walking distance away which was another bonus. All in all we were very happy with our stay here and would definitely return ",4,2013,10,30
219,four nights at North Star Hotel,"I stayed at the North Star both my first and last nights in Dublin.
The hotel staff was very attentive to my requests for information regarding places to eat and to look for tour items.  They also took very good are of me during my stay.
I would stay there again if I travel to Dublin.  The food in the attached restaurant was wonderful.
Plus the proximity to the rail-tours office as well as train lines is wonderful. 
I did not bring the proper clothing for the spa.",5,2013,10,28
219,Would stay again,"Stayed at the North Star for 3 nights and was not disappointed, although the website gives a pm check -in we arrived at 10am and our room on the 4th floor was available.  We had a room opposite the train line which was noisy but you have to expect that due to the close proximity to the train line. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel and our room were very clean and of a very good standard.  The hotel is opposite the tram station and just along the road are bus stops, the hotel is central for bars, shops and restaurants.
We visited Butlers chocolate factory which was very good value for money 12.50 euro for an adult with lots of chocolates to sample and then a 200g chocolate piece to decorate with yet more chocolate. Catch the number 27 bus just along from the hotel to north side shopping centre and a 15 min walk into the industrial estate takes you to chocolate heaven.
The Guinness storehouse is worth a visit as is the Irish night at the Arlington Hotel.
We had breakfast at the hotel each morning which was very nice with a wide choice. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,27
219,North  Star Hotel Dublin,I was a bit dubious about staying in this Hotel because of its location and my knowledge of Dublin.  I had just flown in from working in Norway for a week and paying outrageous prices for basic hotels from 180 euro to 250 for one person.  (in norway that means a single bed only) I booked the North Star as I had a meeting in the city the next morning .  All I can say is from the moment I arrived at reception (it was the male recepionist first evening on duty) to passing staff on my way to the room it felt like I was home.  The staff are so friendly and the rooms were just perfect for the price.  I didnt eat in the Hotel as it was late but I used the parking facility.  When my meeting was over and I went back to collect my car I had a walk through the bar and restaurant and they looked lovely.  If you dont want to walk in this area at night a taxi will only be around 7 euro to Temple Bar/grafton street etc.Cost was 62 euro room only.,4,2013,10,24
219,A lovely stay... Would definitely return,"Stayed here for a long weekend on my first visit to Ireland. Friendly staff on reception, clean room, and a lovely hotel with lots of beautiful features inside and a very relaxed quiet atmosphere.
Breakfast was brilliant with everything you could possibly want and everything cooked well if you want a full English.
Very good location near to city centre. Everything in walking distance.
Drinks in the bar very reasonably priced and a lovely area at the rear of the bar (outside) under an arch for the smokers.
Food in the bar which we only had on the day of leaving was just a panini and this is the only reason why I didn't give 5*... It was burned on 1 side and had hardly any filling... Oh and also the towels in the rooms are for kids as they're very small...
Our room was slightly disappointing as outside our window on our level was the local train which was quite noisy...
Overall a lovely visit... We'll worth the money to stay...",4,2013,10,24
219,Would stay here again when returning to Dublin,"Stayed here midweek back in March this year. Room was large, clean, modern bathroom comfortable, huge bed, small seating area with chairs and table as well as wardrobe and dresser. Room was cleaned every day (stayed for 3 nights). The bar was lovely and open late. Is a really good quality hotel. We stayed at a room at the front overlooking the main road outside but were not bothered by the noise.
Short walk to temple bar (most decent area in Dublin). Also had cheap 5Euro airport transfer (cab cost us 25 on arrival!) booked through reception.
Really cant recommend enough, nothing fell short, the room and whole building was lovely and if we were to come to Dublin again we would come back here.",5,2013,10,23
219,A nice weekend break in Dublin,"We stayed for a weekend as part of a Lastminute.com package.  It is a short walk to/from the airport bus stops on Connolly Street, with shops and bars close by.  Recently refurbished, so quite nice inside, but you can't get away from having a main road to the front of the hotel and a busy railway line immediately to the rear.  We had a room at the back and it was noisy if you had the window open.  Apart from that, the room was clean, bright, well-appointed and everything worked.  It was good to have a fridge in the room, plus the kettle, and an iron/ironing board if you wanted it.  A big plus was that the wi-fi connection was free, a strong signal, and no hassle, both in the lobby and in the room.  There was a small but well-equipped gym in the basement; and the restaurant served us an excellent and well-priced meal, in a pleasant ambience.  The staff were friendly and helpful - one of the waiters suggested we go to the nearby Celt bar for a good meal and some authentic Irish 'craic' - which turned out to be a really good evening.  I'd be happy to go back again, and it was certainly value for money.",4,2013,10,22
219,Lovely stay! ,"We arrived at the North Star at 10am expecting not to be able to get into our room. We quickly checked in and were given keys to our room, eventhough the website says check in time is from 2pm! We booked a double room, we had a room on the 3rd floor and it was a triple which was nice for the extra space! I do have to say there was some noise from the street, but considering we were a 5minute walk to the city centre its nothing! We had booked breakfast too, a buffet of hot and cold. Considering I was with my extremely fussy boyfriend even he was pleased!! The hotel was lovely and they couldnt of done enough for us over the 3 nights they providided information to all the sights etc. But I do have to recommend that if your going to do touristy things definitely get the Dublin Pass before you travel, we saved so much! ",5,2013,10,21
219,So Very Pleased,We checked into this hotel today and the staff could not have been nicer and more accommodating!  We asked for a non smoking room and they placed us in an ideal room so clean and only a short walk to the Temple Bar. We would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin. It is located near a train station and it has air conditioning!!!  We are so pleased!,5,2013,10,20
219,"Wow,very nice hotel","That hotel was in the city of Dublin, close to bars and restaurants. The people were very polite and I loved the room I was in. Thank u so much. I¬¥ll come back for sure. 
Greetings from Berlin, Germany",5,2013,10,20
219,Pleasant stay! ,"I have just returned from a relaxing 2 nights stay at the North Star hotel in Dublin. 
After arriving at Dublin airport at around 7.30am, we decided to take a taxi to the hotel to see if we could drop our bags off. We were pleasantly surprised when the receptionist informed us that we could check in! (Apparently our room had been empty the night before!)  
Our room was of a good size with room for a double & single bed, wardrobe, dressing table and a small table and 2 chairs. It was also nicely decorated and very clean. The bathroom was a little more dated, but like my friend said, as long as it's clean, what does it matter!
We had paid for the buffet style breakfast, which again we were very impressed with. Plenty of hot food available & we thought it was of a decent quality. 
We only had a few niggles with this hotel. On our second day at breakfast, we were placed on a table for 4 (2 tables pushed together) Halfway through eating, the waitress tried to put another couple on our table, even though there were plenty of other tables for two around. We did feel this was a little rude & asked her to separate them, which she did. 
Our other niggle was that our room in the evening was quite dark. As a women, I would have quite liked a bit more light when getting ready, however I know this is just personal preference. 
Over all, good experience and we both said we would defiantly consider this hotel if we returned to Dublin.",5,2013,10,18
219,Good city hotel with decent bar/restaurant,"I really liked this hotel we stayed just for one night and it was perfect for us. On the bus route into the city from the airport, get off just at the rail bridge where you see The Ripley Hotel and double back on yourself on foot for about 5 minutes  to find the North Star.  It looks tiny from the front but inside the foyer is ample, and has  a great bar/restaurant attached. It walk-able to most of the main streets too, we walked back here from temple bar in about 20 minutes, and it was a lot cheaper than those closer.  One thing I noticed about Dublin nowadays is how hard it is for tourists to access free wifi. Most places are locked down/chargeable or you have to get on of the free scrach-cards from a bar. At this hotel, if you buy a drink for the bar/foyer you get a receipt with a  wifi pin, which I know is standard in a lot of places but in Dublin this was a real bonus. If you are flying from Prestwick as we did, or indeed any other airline with a really early arrival time, this is going to be good for you to pass the time until check in ‚Äì unless you want to wander around. We did both, arrived super early (9.30am) asked for early check in, got it around 12.30 which was fine for us especially as hadn‚Äôt given advance notice;  so we left out bags with reception , spend half an hour or so having a coffee/going online in the foyer, then went a walk. Our room was standard, but fine, its actually quite a big hotel once you get into it. No noise and a clean./modern bathroom.  Another life saver was the bar./restaurant as they do decent quality bar meals for about 10-12 euro and when we were there also included in the price was a glass of wine or fizz. When you consider the average price of drinking and eating in this city, this will be a welcome treat! We had opted for a splurge lunch at at 12.30 pm - so come 9pm it was food time again so a filling and tasty roast chicken dinner for 10euro including drink was ideal! Bar staff were full of banter ‚Äì we were there so early that I had a bit of a laugh with one of them as they  were setting up and we were getting drinks /wifi, so that was a good start. There  is also a concierge desk at the hotel which we saw being used a lot, so if you are coming from further afield or for the first time -  you can be sure you will have help/pointers available for tourist attractions/tickets/directions.  I don‚Äôt think there was room service but don‚Äôt quote me on that ‚Äì check it out directly.",4,2013,10,17
219,Great apart from the snobby assistant manager,"We took a short break to Dublin at the beginning of September (6th-9th) and stayed in this hotel. We booked direct with the hotel and received a 10% discount on the booking, free continental breakfast and free Wi-Fi. The majority of the staff were very helpful; We arrived hours before check in but the lady on reception took our luggage and told us to call the hotel in an hour or so to see if any rooms were ready. Location was great - just a 15 min walk to temple bar with all the bar and restaurants. Hotel restaurant was extremely good (I highly recommend the chicken wings), drinks were actually cheaper in the hotel than in most pubs/bars and we also got a free glass of prosecco. My only fault with this hotel would be the assistant hotel manager (unfortunately didn't catch his name), he was seating people at breakfast on our last day and watched us like a hawk the whole time to make sure we were not eating any of the cooked food. After we checked out we sat in the residents lounge (which no one was ever sitting in) to wait for our ride to the airport - and the same assistant hotel manager said we were making the place look scruffy and tried to get us to move; had this been an older couple I doubt this would have been much of an issue. Apart from that - great hotel and great value for money.",4,2013,10,16
219,An Excellent Hotel in the Heart of Dublin City.,"This is my 3rd time staying in this beautiful hotel in the last 7 months and I hope to return again before Christmas for another stay. A very welcoming and extremely comfortable hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Directly across the road from Connolly Station, around the corner from Busaras and a few minutes walk up Talbot Street to O'Connell Street. Very convenient for The Luas and all public transport. Upon arrival we were given an upgrade to a suite which was just gorgeous, on the 6th floor and with our own terrace....needless to say we were just thrilled. Very comfortable beds and seating area. The breakfast here is excellent, a wonderful choice to suit all needs, a very comfortable and relaxing start to the day. I can't recommend this wonderful hotel highly enough. Thank you Linda for the upgrade and thanks also to Ignacio for always being so polite and helpful. Looking forward to my Christmas shopping trip to Dublin already :)",5,2013,10,15
219,More than a bit disappointed,"From the start let me tell you that based my experience, the North Star has great potential, but they just hadn't come close to reaching it when we arrived for a recent stay there for the nights of October 1, 2, and 3.  The first room we were assigned had a broken window which wouldn't shut on a cool rainy evening, so we asked for another.  Our second room was very clean and quite spacious, but austere.  The television was a very small, outdated model and situated in a corner.  Also, unfortunately, the free Wi-Fi service was of very poor quality, and it was impossible to maintain a useable connection.  A call to the front desk only yielded apologies, and upon check-out we were told that they were aware of the need for a booster to be installed for the block of rooms in which we had been staying. The restaurant attached was quite nice, the reception area well appointed, and it is clear that some parts of the hotel had been updated to include premier suites, but I must say, my sister and I felt that our rooms were somehow the ""poor stepchildren"" of this this establishment.  With such a convenient and central location, this hotel holds great promise, but I'm afraid based on our stay, I'm afraid to recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2013,10,15
219,Perfect hotel for a stay in Dublin,"Everything here was great. The room was lovely, the breakfast had a huge choice and the staff members were friendly and helpful.

Didn't use the gym/sauna facilities whilst we were here but they looked very clean and professional.

The hotel bar is large and the night we stayed at the hotel was very enjoyable. The bar was buzzing which you rarely see in the UK.

Location is great, less than a ten minute walk from O'Connell street which leads to anywhere you could want to go, including the hop-on, hop-off tour bus.",5,2013,10,15
219,great location,Hotel is in great location right across the street from connolly station .... was just 10 mins stroll from oconnell street and within easy access for luas and busarus. We were able to walk to a cpl of theatres. The rooms were nice check in was very easy staff were very helpful would definately recommend and stay again.,4,2013,10,14
219,11-14 October 2013,"Great room excellent hotel not one thing to complain about excellent service cannot fault first experience to Dublin and would stop here again definitely

Lannigans excellent food excellent service

Temple bar is the best excellent guiness",5,2013,10,14
219,Great Stay,"Really enjoyed my stay here ...We were able to check in early,room was lovely well maintained .The hotel is ideal for a concert at the o2 as we were a luas ride away  and the same with the city centre .Would stay here again no problem .Staff very helpful :)",4,2013,10,14
219,Excellent Trip - Faultless Highly Recc,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights B&B Oct 10-12th. The hotel was fantastic, we were able to check in early, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. We had room 212 which was immaculate,spacious and recently decorated. 
The hotel itself was located right at the railway station and 10 mins from Oconnell street where there are department stores and shops. It was 15 mins from Temple Bar where there is a huge selection of bars and restaurants! (We ate at Temple Quay- which was lovely and much more reasonable than the cost of eating in Oconnell street). 
We could not fault this hotel we both accessed the gym and sauna, and had our breakfast here - which was amazing! 
I would definitely recommend this hotel, i would also say it was a 4* hotel as it is far superior to any 3* that I have stayed in!   ",5,2013,10,12
219,Always fantastic service,I have been using this hotel for events for my company for the past 6 years and every time we receive fantastic service. During our events we also spend a night or two at the hotel. The rooms are top notch and the recent renovation of the lobby area and the bar area looks fantastic. The staff are always friendly and helpful and do a great job coordinating our events. Plus it's a fantastic central location in Dublin near the train and bus station and walking distance to downtown sightseeing.,5,2013,10,12
219,Perfect weekend hotel,"Stayed three nights at this hotel with a friend and we were very pleased with the hotel. The location is convenient in the city centre but still in a quiet area. The room was just as on the pictures so no surprises and the beds were comfortable.

Most of the staff were very polite and we appreciated the airport transfer at 5am. They also arranged continental breakfast for us and brought it to the room at 4.30 am without a tray charge.

I would defenitely stay at this hotel again and can recommend it.",4,2013,10,06
219,"Average, but ok","Access to rooms was difficult - had to carry heavy bags up stairs to before reaching lifts.  We had a lot of trouble getting wifi coverage in the rooms.  Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were clean.  Reception staff didn't seem particularly friendly.  They weren't rude, but not welcoming.  I felt like I was interrupting their work when I wanted to pay before leaving.  Car park attendants were lovely, and very helpful.",3,2013,10,05
219,3 day stay.,"Nice clean hotel, there were no towels on arrival, the toilet seat was broken and tv remote faulty but all quickly fixed by the following day. It was Very noisy in the mornings as the maids station was outside my room, they never stopped yakking. The safe parking area was good and secure.",3,2013,10,04
219,So good changed my two night stay to four!!,"I always say I will, but never actually get around to writing a review after my stay at a hotel. However, after enjoying my stay at The North Star Hotel, Dublin so much I have had to change my ways so here goes! As the title says my stay was so good in fact that I changed my original two night stay to four!

I jumped on a bus at Dublin Airport and was dropped less than two minutes walk from the Hotel. Upon arrival I was greeted by the most courteous of staff who upgraded me for free to the most amazing room with balcony on the 8th floor. The room was enormous and also came with complementary admission to the members bar which although I didn't drink at, did pop my head in, and was impressed with decor and relaxed atmosphere.

Room itself was spotless and contemporary and you wanted for nothing. It was beautifully sunny and so balcony doors open were a must. Yes you do hear passing trains but it really didn't bother me in fact I quite liked it, felt very NYC and these stopped well before I went to sleep.

I did discover a faulty flashing light bulb in the bathroom but this was dealt with so swiftly it made no impact on my stay at all.

I had a delicious salad and Prosecco in the downstairs bar and restaurant McGettigans and was also given a token for free Prosecco with main meal which was very welcome! I didn't have breakfast so can't comment but did walk past the spacious room in which it was held and noticed guest being seated immediately and other satisfied looking ones eating!

They have a small but well equipped gym and sauna which I had for my personal use every time I visited. 

Brilliant location for bus station, train station and taxi‚Äôs and easy walk to convenience stores including Tesco. 

I can't rate this hotel highly enough and have booked it again for my upcoming stay. Can‚Äôt wait to return!

Don't hesitate book right away.",5,2013,10,04
219,The Best!!!,"Being from Vermont I was pleasantly surprise and totally overwhelmed at how much the staff made us feel at home.  The restaurant and their bartenders, especially Keith and Sean, went out of their way to help us navigate around the city.  Keirin, the concierge, helped us in planning a visit to meet with a priest to bless our marriage within 2 weeks.  The carriage ride and the driver we grand and the extra in the tour of the city was nice.  
We were sent to this hotel on a recommendation and this was a wonderful choice.  I would go back for another visit and stay there.  We were also lucky enough to meet the owner and also praised his staff and his accomodations we more than we could have ever hoped for.  You could not go wrong to choose this hotel and did I mention that it is in the heart of the city and we were able to walk to most of what we wanted to do.",5,2013,10,03
219,North stars hidden gem,"The hotel seems to be split to parts old and recently renovated. Both are more than acceptable. The restaurant is the gem of this place. I have over the past 12 months been staying in hotels in Dublin for business and the food served is the best I've had in Dublin. In fact if I'm not staying in the hotel I still eat there!

",4,2013,10,03
219,comfort in dublin,"this hotel is ten-15 minutes walk from o,connell street the main street running through Dublin.i went with my three sisters for a 5 day stay. we got the airport bus with the Dublin bus company and alighted  at Talbot street and the hotel is literally round the corner from where we alighted . we had a room with three single beds in which was nice because usually you can only get a double bed and a single bed in most hotels when we travel together,the room was excellent and well maintained everyday, beds were  comfortable, plenty of pillows ,hairdrier,iron and board ,teamaking facilities were all in the room. the hotel is near to Connelly street train station which is the main station for mainline trains and the dart (Dublin area rapid transport) ,but we never heard any trains where we were and we had the window open most nights as we were lucky with the weather which was warm. wherever you go in Dublin it is busy and this hotel area is busy but again we heard no street noises ,we were on the fourth floor ,but you had lifts to all areas .including from the fourth floor right down to 0 where the breakfast room was. we went bed and breakfast so I cant comment on the restaurant but the breakfast was outstanding giving you a good start to the day. it had everything  from cereals to hot food and it was all laid out and served to a very high standard ,the staff were lovely. if you went out of the breakfast room hungry it was your own fault, we paid for a deal where our breakfast was included but if you paid separate the breakfast was 12 euro,s .the main restaurant always looked busy but we never  ate there. there are porters to carry your luggage if you require them. if you wanted they also had premier rooms to upgrade to . my one criticism is the Wi-Fi , although it was supposed to be in all areas free in the hotel,i could not get logged in and had to wait until we were out and about before we could get Wi-Fi .we did ask at reception and he said apparently there system was not always available in some areas of the hotel,so if you rely on Wi-Fi  business wise you might be disappointed ,it did not inconveince me just had to wait till I was outside to use any apps I might want to. other than that this hotel is warm comfortable and central to Dublin tourist spots, well worth staying in .",5,2013,09,30
219,"Would definitely return, a great 3*-almost a 4*!","I was a little wary, as other reviewers were, as the outside of the hotel certainly needs a re-paint. We caught the Paddywagon to the hotel-which was FOC, we did not book through the hotel, just went to the coach park. - Beware, this is not a green coach as the hotel website states, it will probably be a white one with a big green logo on the back windscreen! 
We left our bags at reception as we arrived early, and decided to venture in to the centre. After reading reviews on here I was expecting the hotel to be further out of the city, in fact it is a ten minute walk from the hotel to the central O'Connel Street. The area the hotel is in is quite busy too though, there are plenty of little shops and pubs. 
Upon our return we checked-in quickly and went up to the room. I am glad we paid the extra 30euros for an upgrade, as this was the sort of room I wanted, I would not have been happy with less. It was about the same level as a good holiday inn, so not sure what the standard rooms were like. Bed was comfy, it was a reasonable size, and reception/room service were quick to respond to any requests. The only downside, is that this hotel is part of the train station in a way, so if you have the window open you will hear the trains every now and again. 
The hotel bar was the best we went to throughout our whole stay, compared to other bars we went to it was reasonably priced. the barmen were very professional and attentive, there was a great atmosphere, quite sophisticated. Plenty of space, the outside smoking area was lovely! I certainly would not have expected this for a 3* hotel. We did not try the food, as we saw a burger that someone had ordered on our first night, and it was quite small!
We had a cooked breakfast on the first day for an extra 7euros each, it was okay- I would recommend finding a little caf√© though if you have the time and what a cooked breakfast as it was not quite hot enough. Hence why we had a cold breakfast on the second day, there was not much selection here - could be improved. I though it weird that they separated the breakfast in this way, even a budget Ibis hotel charges one price for everything!
On our last day we left our bags again, although there was a huge football match in the city, so the hotel had specials on and it was full of fans. We managed to find a chair though and waited for the Paddywagon, look forward to staying again!",5,2013,09,30
219,lovely hotel,Stayed here as was very handy for concert at 02....very reasonable..booked it through trivago which worked out at 90euro for b&b for 2 which is very good for central dublin...had booked a few months in advance..didnt have evening meal  here but breakfast very good..staff very helpful and courteous,5,2013,09,23
219,Great stay!,"In Dublin for a congress & hotel was near the venue, my room was spacious & nicely decorated & the staff were friendly & very helpful. My room was at the front of the hotel & it was a little noisy at night. Breakfast was yummy & had an evening meal in the hotel restaurant which was reasonably priced & lovely. Would stay here again!",4,2013,09,23
219,Pleasantly surprised!,"We got our room through secret rooms on lastminute.com it was only ¬£60 so we didn't expect much and alot of people tried to put us off by saying it is far away from everything! How wrong we all were, our room was huge with two double (extremely comfortable) beds and a single along with a sofa and dining table. We decided to have dinner as we didn't have much time to venture out before heading to the o2 for a concert, we were going to have the two courses for 20 euro but there unfortunately wasn't alot to chose from on that menu so we both went for fish and chips, my only complaint was I could have ate twice as much it was really lovely! The hotel is convenient to everything; right beside the station and it took only 20 minutes to walk to the o2 and 15 to get into Dublin center. We ventured into town the next day but returned shortly after due to the poor weather, we sat in the cosy bar and were served by two lovely bar men who were only to eager to please, I sampled an appletini which was the best made appletini I have ever tried (and trust me I've had a few) and my partner had a few Guinness which didn't disappoint!

I would recommend this hotel to everyone its so handy to the station you can leave your bags there during the day if you have checked out then pick them up really easily before catching the train again, the staff are lovely and so are the rooms! I will definitely be returning :)",4,2013,09,18
219,Right next to the station. No frills but adequate hotel.,"This hotel is right by the train station and the couple we were with couldn't sleep from the train going over their room. We didn't hear it in ours. The breakfast was good. We arrived early and they held our bags for us until check in which was nice. Staff up front was pleasant. The parking was weird but right on site. There were a lot of stairs that couldn't be avoided so if stairs are an issue, avoid this hotel. ",3,2013,09,18
219,"Nice Staff, Average Facility","Stayed one night prior to Railtours trip.  No rooms were available when we arrived so we had to walk around Dublin for several hours on a chilly morning.  We did get to rest in the lounge which was decent.  The rooms are nice but very small, location near Connolly station is ok for small shops and pubs, seems like an area that is improving, but still a bit away from Central Dublin and Grafton Street.  

This is an ok choice for a short term stay but don't do a Dublin only trip here, they're a better locations and choices.",3,2013,09,15
219,would stay again,"We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel on the ground floor - we requested this when we booked. The room was nice and clean. The ceilings are quite low which makes the place feel a bit claustrophobic, otherwise fine.
The price we paid for bed and continental breakfast was good. The hotel is a manageable walk to everywhere and we would certainly stay again. A million times better than the grotty b&b we stayed in last year.",4,2013,09,15
219,Happy dayz in Dublin,"We were slightly apprehensive based on some of the reviews, but were pleasantly surprised on arrival. We arrived early and asked to leave our bags, the very nice lady on reception told us our room was ready and was ok to go up. The room was good, clean and comfortable. We had no issues at all. All the staff were friendly, we didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on that but all looked and smelt good. We would gladly stay again............ providing we were in the same part of the hotel !! I can understand that if closer to the railway line you may hear the trains that pass over. The walk to the main part of the city may not be the prettiest, but we felt quite happy wondering down the street. Some of the reviews baffled us, what do people expect from a CITY centre hotel.",4,2013,09,14
219,Birthday weekend away!,"This hotel is perfect! We had booked a double room and on arrival had been upgraded to a premier room on the 7th floor! It was fantastic amazing views over Dublin city with the balcony from the room. The room itself was immaculate with a huge super king bed which was super so cozy! The staff we very friendly and happy to help you would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin it's perfect location for trains, buses and trams which are just a 2 min walk from hotel. Prices were also very reasonable in the bar and they did have food at the hotel but we didn't eat here which was a shame as it looked lovely. Keep up the great work at this hotel would recommend it and will hopefully be back! :)))",5,2013,09,10
219,first time in dublin,"On appearances this hotel looked rather shoddy from the street, the rooms at the front of the hotel literally are overlooking the main road and a railway line disects the front and back of the hotel. but having said this the suites and premier rooms(which is what we stayed in were really good). The reception desk were very helpful and accomodating with any information that was needed. The buffet breakfast was a mass of everything you could possibly want for breakfast, the buffet breakfast was in our room rate, so I can't comment on the cost, but I must have put on weight whilst we stayed there.It was very well situated, the station was over the road from the hotel, because of this all the trains approached the station slowly, so you didn't hear them at all. You could catch trains up the coast aswell as down the coastline. All the main shops and the river Liffey(which had a foot bridge at the end of all the main streets) were within 5mins. Not in the luxury class, but nevertheless a reasonably good hotel.",3,2013,09,09
219,Surprisingly good.,"This hotel is very near Connolly Station in Dublin.  It has been recently renovated and has reasonably good rooms for a 3 star hotel and plenty of space.  Breakfast is also good and reasonably priced.  
Very convenient to the centre of the town by tram.  Friendly, competent staff.
Like other reviewers I had never stayed there before because I was worried about the location.
In fact there were no problems but coming back at night from the centre I would take taxi.
Would go back no problem.",4,2013,09,07
219,Not fancy but just right,"Our travel agent found this hotel for us. The prices are excellent. The hotel itself is right across from the Connolly Station although their wasn't that much noise from the trains. It is on a busy street and is about a 10 min walk from O'Connell Street.

The staff was excellent and very helpful. We needed to get into our room early and they made it happen with no fuss at all. 

The rooms are small but serviceable and very clean. Housekeeping staff was great! 
Not in the swankiest part of town and the furniture is a little worn but the bed was clean and very comfortable.

We would stay there again and also recommend it.",3,2013,09,07
219,Perfect Stay,"We stayed in this hotel 2nd September for one night. The staff were very good, the hotel was very clean, the breakfast was fantastic.  The car park was at the side of the hotel which was manned 24 hours a day, the charge for this was 8 euro. I suppose in a big city it was secure so I didn't mind paying. I would have to say that I would stay here the next time I am  in Dublin. Location was perfect eg. opposite Connolly railway station, bus station just down the street and very close the  city centre. Brilliant.",4,2013,09,04
219,convenient good central hotel,"Stayed here in Mid August. As can be gauged from previous posters this hotel is ideal for travellers passing through or staying for a few days in Dublin. Rail passengers arriving at Connolly Station will find it directly across the road. The light rail, Luas, is  also just across the road. The central bus depot, Busaras, is less than two minutes walk away. Dublin centre is approx ten minutes walk so overall it is most central. Also ideal for concerts at the 02 arena. The hotel itself is a good standard three star. Noise from trains can be an issue but I found it little inconvenience - slept like a log. Rooms are well decorated, comfortable beds, TV, tea/coffee making, lovely bathroom/shower. Breakfast was top class with excellent choice. We had a meal at the hotel restaurant, McGettigans, which was delicious. The staff ensure your stay is satisfactory and couldn't be more helpful. Some posters have expressed reservations about the location and anti-social behaviour in the neigbourhood. Probably a slight issue at night but personally I felt safe, although I must say I didn't venture out at night. Overall a good hotel and recommended.",4,2013,09,03
219,Pleasantly surprised as never heard of this hotel....Would go again.,"We were going to a show in Bord Gas, so wanted a place near enough to there.  I was a little bit worried about the location of this hotel, so was a bit apprehensive from the start but need not have worried. The location ended up being ideal as it was only a short walk or a Luas journey (which is literally a few steps away from the Hotel) to Bord Gas. It is also right on the door step of the train station and bus station - so one doesn't have to drive to it.  The exterior was getting a beautiful coat of fresh paint when we arrived.  I was slightly worried about what our rooms would look like as from the outside the hotel doesn't really look much, however I was very pleasantly surprised.  We were in one of the premier rooms and I just loved the colour scheme and freshness of the room, including our balcony.  The mattress was so comfortable and really I could not fault the rooms in anyway, but only give it top stars.  The bar area is also decorated lovely as is the outside smoking area, with its fairy lights trailing down the wall. The only thing I believed let down the look was the stairs from reception and the door leading to lifts are scratched and in need of a good coat of paint.  Its only a small thing...but seems such a shame that not done, when the rest of the area is looking so lovely with its colour scheme. Even the purple and pink chairs give it a lovely look.  All staff, with the exception of none...were extremely friendly. Sean in the bar was just lovely to chat too and made the experience of our holiday so enjoyable.  We had the continental breakfast -  which had a large selection of breakfast cerals etc and it was all lovely, however I missed having little sunflower seeds, nuts etc but that is just probably me and others may not like those extras.  Again the breakfast staff were exceptionally friendly. Only things to watch out for... if you go to park before 12 noon on the day of your arrival you are charged per hour..as a different company look after the parking.  Also I would not wander that area at night - not the safest part of town.  Over all a very pleasant  friendly, hotel that really surprised me, and I would defiantly stay in again.  Well done all. :)",4,2013,09,02
219,It was ok,"The hotel was generally clean and reasonably maintained, but in need of renovations.  There was a musty smell to both the room and the common areas, especially the lounge that we never saw people in (probably due to the powerful musty smell that made it very uncomfortable).  On the first night we were in a room that had the trains going by regularly and often, making the room extremely noisy and resulting in a restless sleep.  They were able to move us to another room for the rest of our stay that was not as noisy.  The bathroom facilities were mediocre.  The buffet breakfast in the morning had a good selection and the service was good.  We had one very nice lady at the front desk help us out.  I hope that they do something with the musty smell/tiredness of the hotel.",3,2013,09,01
219,Dont be put off...,"When we arrived at this hotel we were put off by the shabby frontage and the entry to the car park, and were about to go somewhere else. That would have been a BIG mistake! The room turned out to be first class, the restaurant and bar just brilliant, and the food and service was on par with some of the best 5* hotels that we have stayed in. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to most of the city centre venues. Definitely use this hotel again",5,2013,09,01
219,Fantastic hotel,"Don't know why this hotel is only a 3 star it should be much higher. Couldn't fault it at all. Great service, well priced, lovely warm staff. Stayed in a premier room 665 for 3 nights lovely and spacious and so clean and great facilities. The continental breakfast was brill aswell. Some lovely unique cocktails in mcgettigans bar. The concierge held our luggage for 4 hours and the wifi was great too. Fab stay. Returning in October. ",5,2013,09,01
219,2 night Bed and Breakfast (Supervalu break),"On arrival to the hotel we were to early for check in so the receptionist offered to mind our bags if we wanted to go around Dublin, which we did.
The room we got was a family room with 2 single beds and a double bed, nice and spacious and the room had air conditioning. the bathroom had all the condiments (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, face cloths).
The breakfast was average, loads to choose from but not the best quality (cheap sausages, scrambled eggs - tasteless, bacon - salty, orange juice - sour) but it was sufficient for the first morning of our stay but we opted not to have it the second morning after paying 12.95 each which explains itself. 
The staff were nice and friendly and couldn't do enough for us.
The McGettigans Cookhouse Grill (The bar)  was FABULOUS - i cannot express how good the food was. We had steak which was so tender it just melted in our mouths. 

The shower in our room didn't get hot which was very disappointing, the TV in the room had only 10 rubbish channels with poor signal, the toilet in the bathroom leaked from the back.

Overall my stay was enjoyable, I would stay at this hotel again which i suppose says something. 

It is perfect for the trains and the Luas but if you are a light sleeper then this hotel is not for you as the trains start from 6am and they run right past the hotel.",4,2013,09,01
219,Loved my stay,"Went for a family holiday and really couldn't fault it,  Big, clean comfy rooms and friendly helpful staff.  The breakfast and hotel restaurant (McGettigans cookhouse and bar) were also great.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2013,08,31
219,Lovely Hotel and outstanding staff,"Just back from 3 days in Dublin staying at the North star hotel. The location of this hotel is very good as you are beside the luas and Railway station so it is very easy to get to.The rooms are very clean and comfortable .We opted not to have the Full Irish breakfast and had more than enough with the continental, juices, cereals, selection of breads and fruits.All staff we met were very helpful and so friendly.We will return next time we are in Dublin.",5,2013,08,31
219,Enjoyed my stay,"Booked this hotel blind through an online site.  Had some trepidation on looking at the reviews subsequent to learning the name of the hotel, but was totally satisfied with my choice. 

The location isn't the best, near the bus and train stations and seems to attract some less desirable characters.  The last night I was there, there was a shooting in the area (though I'm sure not a regular occurrence).  Having said that, I never felt unsafe.  I might recommend taking taxis back to the hotel late at night.  

The room was spacious and had air conditioning that worked very well.  It was also clean.  That was really about all I needed.  Beds were very comfortable.  Staff were pleasant.  

Yes, the WiFi charge is extortionate, but is free if you go to the restaurant.  

I would stay here again if I needed a decent option that's in reasonable walking distance of most of the sites.",4,2013,08,29
219,2Day B&B with evening meal,"This hotel was excellent value, spotless and extremely friendly and helpful staff.
Should be 4 if not five star.
We had our meal in McGettigans cookhouse & bar part of the hotel, and the food was superb (michelin standard) we had Chowder and Ham hock started and it was devine, followed by 10oz rib steak with creme brulee for desert which was to die for. The food was so good and presentation was impeccable that we book for the 2nd night and was further thrilled with our choice could not fault it and very good value for the standard and competition in Dublin. I would strongly recommend it to anyone.",5,2013,08,29
219,Food in the hotel restuarant,"On a very cold, wet afternoon we arrived in Dublin off the train from Belfast and headed to the hotel restuarant for food.  We were greeted by a friendly waiter who showed us to our table.  Drinks ordered and menu perused.  Our main course and dessert was first class. An enjoyable meal on a very wet day.  Would highly recommend for food and if going to Dublin for a break would be very tempted to book accommodation.",5,2013,08,28
219,Ideal for short stay,"Great wee hotel opposite Connelly Street Train Station.
The staff were very helpful.
Clean, spacious bedrooms with TV, hair dryer etc.

It's quite a walk to the city centre, but for  concerts in the Aviva or Croke Park the hotel is ideally located.

Great prices for B&B in Dublin.  The breakfast is grand and there was plenty of it.",4,2013,08,27
219,great location,"Just returned from  a three night break in the North Star Hotel Dublin.
On arrival we were warmly greeted and check-in was swift. Room 762 was large and very comfortable . At the back of hotel, so no noise from the nearby railway station. Full breakfast was included and was really good.Plenty of choice and well cooked.
The hotel is in a great location for visiting all that Dublin has to offer.
All in all a good choice of hotel and I would certainly use this hotel again.",5,2013,08,27
219,Friendly hotel,"Have stayed here several times and been upgraded on my last visit. Rooms are very comfortable; hotel bar friendly and used by locals; food in the bar & restaurant good as is the service.
I'm originally from Dublin and though not the best/upmarket area of the city the area is safe as any other & it is conveniently located for the city centre and transport connections.
Will be back again in October using the North Star as my base for the marathon along with many other runners & their families.",5,2013,08,27
219,"Good stay, but need to pay for WiFi","I was glad that my experience in North Star was a great one, despite the mixed reviews in TA. 
Connolly station is directly opposite the hotel, and central bus station is a few mins away (airlink bus stops there). It's a 10 mins walk to O'Connell st., and another 5 mins to temple bar. 
Hotel room looked newly refurbished. Beds were comfortable. I could not switch on the TV as it was ""locked"" and the toilet lights blinked throughout the night. It was not a major problem so I did not inform the front desk. 
The only thing I don't understand is why they charge WiFi access for guests. It should be complimentary. 
No extra charge to keep your luggage there after check-out.",4,2013,08,27
219,Happy Returning Customer,"Any time I am in Dublin I stay at this hotel. It's in a great central location, very reasonably priced and has great service. The rooms are beautiful and immaculately clean, the food and atmosphere is very nice and despite being near a train station, the trains couldn't be heard from inside our room. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I will definitely be returning again and recommending friends.",5,2013,08,26
219,Enjoyable 3 Night Stay - No Complaints,"I first stayed at The North Star Hotel in August 2011 for a 4 night stay and returned in August 2013 for a further 3 night stay.

On both occasions I have found this hotel to be fantastic.

On my most recent stay my friend and I booked a standard room however on arrival we were delighted to be given a premier club room on the top floor.

Check-in was quick and easy, staff were friendly and welcoming.

The room itself was spotlessly clean, spacious and well decorated. The room had a balcony, tea and coffee making facilities, air conditioning, a full size iron and ironing board, a full size hair dryer and a shower gel/shampoo. The room was cleaned and fresh towels provided daily.

The hotel is in a good location, directly opposite Connolly station and minutes from O'Connell Street, being so close to the railway wasn't a problem as the noise could barely be heard.

There is also a gym on the ground floor but I never used it personally, it looked well equip and spacious.

We had breakfast as part of our stay and there was a good selection of cereals, fruit, continental style meats and cheeses, juices or a full Irish breakfast consisting of sausages, eggs, bacon, white pudding, black pudding, beans, mushrooms, tomatoes and soda bread. The breakfast room tended to be quite bust but we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to be seated,

The bar/diner area is also well decorated and laid out. We didn't have any meals in the hotel only drinks which weren't anymore expensive than anywhere else. The hotel also has a nice beer garden which is covered so you can sit out in all weathers, I spent a lot of time here and it's a nice relaxing area. Good selection of alcoholic drinks, beers and cocktails to choose from. When the main bar closes there is a private residents lounge where you can purchase further drinks.

Check out was also quick and easy and we didn't have to check out until 11:30am which was a reasonable time as a lot of hotels are much earlier. Our flight wasn't until later in the day so staff kept hold of our bags until we were ready to leave for the airport.

All in all a very enjoyable stay, this hotel will probably be my first choice on all further trips to Dublin.",5,2013,08,26
219,Pleasantly surprised!,"Stayed here for 3 nights in August 2013.
The hotel is around a 10 minute walk to O'Connell Street and then a further 5 minute walk to temple bar. The walk to the centre is fairly interesting and like some of the other reviews, I must admit its in a slightly dodgey area! Saying that we never received any trouble. 
The hotel reception area ia modern, fresh and clean and looking more like a 4* than a 3*. 
We were quickly checked in and made our way to the rooms. 
The rooms were large and clean. We were situated opposite the railway bridge however our room was on the ground floor so we didn't get disturbed by the trains at all. 
Rooms were cleaned each day and tea/coffee and bathroom gels were replaced. The bathroom was large and the shower was pretty decent and powerful. 
We had 3 rooms booked and unfortunately 2 of our rooms had broken locks on. The mechanism in my sisters door did not work and she frequently spent up to about 10 mins trying to get into her room every day. We made the staff aware who advised someone would fix the lock however this never happened! 
Breakfast was priced at ‚Ç¨12.95 which was too expensive for us so we either went to the Spar shop next door (which has hot counter, coffee machine, fruit etc) or to the Graingers pub across the road which has a ‚Ç¨5.00 breakfast deal. 
Overall, the hotel was pleasant and much better than expected. I would stay here again if the price was right, although for a few extra euros, if you can get yourself a bit closer to town it would be worth it.",4,2013,08,26
219,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed there for 2 nights a while back to see ""Riverdance"" at the Gaiety, and i loved it! We stayed in a premier suite, and it was very spacious with all mod cons, and a very comfortable bed!
The food was lovely,albiet we only had the bar food, (never tried the restaurant,) but i can honestly say it was top notch!
Its a fabulous hotel location wise, a hop skip and a jump to temple bar and grafton street, which was handy after a few beers!!!
 I loved the smokers area, it was fabulous!, And very unique! You can hear the trains rumbling overhead,i've never been in a place like it, 
 Definately consider this hotel if you're in Dublin, its not too expensive, the rooms are good, as is the location",4,2013,08,25
219,Good short stay hotel,"I stayed here with my wife, son and mother. We had a double and a twin club room for two days and then a standard twin and double (two separate bookings). Firstly the hotel is about one minute away from dublins main train station, Connolly train station ( very noisy from 6 o'clock in the morning when the trains start to roll )and about ten minutes walk away from O'Connell Street. The staff are friendly and helpful. The decor is good enough. The bar/restaurant is very good. The difference in the club rooms and standard rooms is not much, a few extra fixtures and fittings, a balcony ( not a good idea with young kids ). The standard rooms are equally as good at a much better price. The breakfast buffet is fairly standard with other hotels and good. Please don't wear anything more than a light t-shirt to the breakfast room, it is absolutely roasting, seriously it is about 25 degrees plus, the air con can't cope.

All in all a good enough clean hotel, worth staying at if you are not paying too much.",4,2013,08,24
219,A very nice hotel,"We were moved to the North Star Hotel following a problem with the water where we were supposed to be staying, so had no idea what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel has obviously undergone recent refurbishment and all the areas we saw were extremely nice with contemporary furnishings and decoration. 

Our room on the sixth floor did overlook the train line but had double glazing, air con and was spacious. The breakfast was great and comprised of buffet style for both continental and full Irish. There were communal areas with seating and a residents lounge.

The area wasn't brilliant but it was right by the train station, so potentially convenient in that respect, and having now spent more time in Dublin it's by no means the worst area!

We've seen a recent negative review which surprised us based on our experience. It said they were given a voucher for champagne. The voucher we were given was for prosecco and that is indeed what we were served. They also said there was no lift. There was a lift to all floors although it was necessary to go up 16 (I counted!) stairs to access it. They also criticised the lack of air con. We did have air con but I can't comment as to whether it was in all rooms.

Overall we were very pleased with this hotel and couldn't fault either the decor, comfort or service from the staff. Apparently it's awaiting a regrading to 4* and we feel this would be most deserved.",5,2013,08,23
219,surprise!,arrived with foreboding seeing the railway line so near but the room was huge and the although the train line was so close there was very little noise. the bed was so comfortable and the hotel as a whole was clean and decorated to a high standard. very friendly staff too....,5,2013,08,23
219,Great Hotel,"For those arriving by train from Belfast this hotel couldn't be more convenient as it's just across the road from Connolly Station. You'll receive a warm welcome from the staff,all of whom are very polite and helpful. The rooms are clean and well appointed and the beds are really comfortable. As for other reviewers tales of train noise the only time I heard any was whilst sitting in the very nice beer garden, which being located under a railway arch, added to the charm.
The hotel is also within easy walking distance of all major sites and the tram from the station will get your further afield. All in all a great hotel and I will be back.",5,2013,08,22
219,Great Hotel,We got this hotel on Secrets Hotels and were not disappointed....The rooms were fab.. and huge... and even though we were on the first floor overlooking the train station.. there was not much noise.. and we had a very comfortable stay.. would definitely come back here to stay,5,2013,08,21
219,very nice hotel,"We arrived off express bus from Cork  for one night before travelling onwards and  I was  a little unnerved when walking through the area. However walking into the lobby of the hotel was such a relief, old fashioned grandeur and pleasant and courteous reception staff.  Then we discovered we had been given a free upgrade to a suite which delighted us. The staff in the bar were good although the food in my opinion was overpriced for what we got. Breakfast was good quality and the eggs were lovely. Overall really enjoyed our brief stay in this hotel it is ideally situated for bus and rail travel although the particular area has little else to offer.",4,2013,08,21
219,Worst place I stayed in Dublin,"For the price we payed I wanted to like this place. The inside seemed rather nicely decorated and the staff were extremely polite and helpful. We checked into our hotel with no problems. They did not have a lift but offered assistance bringing our bags upstairs. When we got to our room we realized the floor was slanted. You have to pay a lot for the wifi as well. They gave us a voucher with 2 free glasses of champagne with a meal purchase. When we went to redeem the vouchers they gave us champagne that tasted really old. It was flat, more like a cheap glass of white wine. What they don't tell you is that this hotel is located in a shady part of town. We were not told that they shut and lock all doors after a certain hour (unsure of what time) so we had to wait outside for 20 minutes until someone came to let us in. It is also so close to a train station that you can hear and feel the trains pass by every 20 minutes all night long. They don't have ac, so in order to not have to sleep in a stuffy room you have to keep the windows open. Which makes every passing train worse. On top of the fact that you can hear the music from the patio until 3am. For the price we paid I expected so much more. Would not recommend staying here for anyone who might want a good nights sleep.",1,2013,08,21
219,Really enjoyed our stay. First class hotel,We arrived at the hotel and I must say from outside thought it looked dowdy. How wrong we were. The hotel is first class and we had a lovely stay. Couldn't find fault with anything. Friendly welcoming staff that could not do enough for you. Spotless comfy room. Snowy white bedding and towels and immaculately clean. The breakfast was superb with everything you could wish for both hot and cold. The bar was lovely to sit and enjoy a first class Guinness with very friendly staff to chat to. There were lovely little comfort spots along the corridors with quaint little sofa and chairs. We were told that the hotel is a three star but awaiting credit to become a four star and we agree that it is very worthy of a four star. All in all a lovely hotel and we will be back.,5,2013,08,20
219,Definitely Worth A Return Visit,"At short notice, I managed to get a one night stay, bed and breakfast, and at close proximity to the rail network, it was perfect for easy connection with everyone.
I was pleasantly surprised at the refurbishment, and would thoroughly recommend a longer stay next time.
The staff were pleasant and helpful upon arrival, and the bar/restaurant staff were friendly and courteous, whether it was late at night, or even with a different group of staff the next day.
I shall be checking my diary for a special get away, and look forward to making it a regular stop.",5,2013,08,19
219,Fab hotel for a short break,"Stayed here in July for a 2 night break. When we were in the taxi from the airport the driver warned us of the location and at that point we doubted where we were staying. When we pulled up we were pleasantly surprised at the hotel. The reception area was clean, modern and the night staff that checked us in were very friendly. Room was perfect for what we needed, clean, two beds and all the amenities inc air con. One downfall on the first night was our hot water wouldn't work but second night was fine. The bar area was fab with fantastic staff. Only a very short walk to the city centre but we got taxis at night. I would definitely recommend.",4,2013,08,18
219,Average,"Northstar Hotel is situated at the cross over of old ,poor area & new,modern area of Dublin. The hotel reflects exactly the situation. Its facade & lobby area is old & poor. Dingy,smelly with street traffic noise added to it. However,inside it is reasonably modern with good security.Pleasantly surprising that although the railway passes over it,there is very little noise of it inside.The rooms are fair size,however with no privacy ,as the next building folks can see through your room. You need to put your curtains drawn all the time. The room TV has nothing to offer except a few Irish news channels.Shopping area is walking distance. The staff is very friendly & helpful. This may be a good hotel if you are looking to spend only the nights there, going around Dublin during the day time.One can get so many such hotels around. Nothing to differentiate this average hotel.",3,2013,08,17
219,"Good Hotel, but needs to install air conditioning","It's a Good Hotel,  Friendly staff (especially Sean the bar man!), large rooms and a good breakfast. Not far from the centre. The only drawback is the lack of air conditioning. ( A fan provided by the staff was not bad but still room was uncomfortably warm/hot.

I recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",3,2013,08,16
219,Just the ticket for a city break in Dublin,"First class.  Excellent facility for a trip to Dublin.  Get off the train, check in and hit the city for shopping, sight seeing or just socialising.  Clean, modern, and food is excellent. Highly recommended!!",5,2013,08,14
219,TWO NIGHTS AT THE HOTEL,"The first night couldn't sleep because of the noise of the train and the second night I passed it in a no smoking room which was smaller, more expensive, with less chanels TV, and with the small of cigarrettes in my bathroom, coming from other room.",3,2013,08,14
219,Great 3 star Dublin hotel...good value.,"Booked this hotel as our usual choice for Dublin weekends was fully booked. We read reviews and they were a mixed bag with some loving it and some hating it. So, decided to book and keep an open mind. We paid around ¬£190 for a two night B&B stay which was great value compared to our usual hotel. 
Easy trip from airport to hotel as the airlink bus stops a few yards around the corner from the hotel door.  Check in was quick and easy with two lovely people on the desk.  They booked us in and explained where to go for breakfast and other facilities. Our room was just lovely (461) and was modern, spacious, fab bathroom, fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, bed was best we have slept in and six feet wide! We had emailed before arriving and asked for a king size as other half is 6'5"" tall! So, all in all a great birthday weekend stay. Other reviews have complained of noise from the train and although our room was very close and we could see them passing often the noise didn't bother us or keep us awake. So nothing to worry about. Breakfast was great with full Irish buffet which was piping hot and thick cut back bacon and tasty sausages amongst the other items. Sliced cheese and roast beef as well as fresh fruit salad and tinned fruits, yoghurts etc,etc.  we have many shorts breaks each year and this place is certainly well worth the money and a hotel we will return to. Just five minutes easy walk to O'connell Street and 10 minutes to Grafton Street and Temple Bar area.
We needed to leave our bags at the hotel as had a late flight.....we collected them about 7pm....no charge as others on TA have stated needs to be paid.",5,2013,08,13
219,Perfect Location with excellent food and service,"On a recent trip to Dublin I was un-sure were to book but went for the North star hotel based on the location from Connelly street train station - ""Just across the road"". I have to say that I was more than happy with this hotel.
Firstly the twin room was a good size and very clean along with good sized bathroom.
On one night we decided just to eat in the bar area which was the best decision I ever made.
Both myself and friend ordered a rib-eye steak and both agreed straight away that it was by far the nicest rib-eye steak we ever had and being big steak eaters that is a good recommendation.
Another excellent point to this hotel is the large heated beer garden which really is different with a lot of atmosphere about it.
We hope to be going back to Dublin within the next 4-5 weeks and this will definitely be the hotel for us! I would also recommend this hotel to all my family and friends looking for a well priced good hotel with excellent welcoming staff.",5,2013,08,12
219,lovely hotel,"stayed here recently for Michael buble concert. The double room was lovely, clean modern and great shower. I have to say the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! We had meal in the restaurant the evening we arrived and it was so good that we ate there agin the following evening before going home. The reception staff and waiting staff were terrific and couldn't have been more helpful. central location was great too and hotel had bus to take guests to concert for a small fee which was very helpful. Would def stay again.",5,2013,08,10
219,Great hotel & Excellent location,This is my second stay at the North Star Hotel & would definately recommend.  I stayed in the four beded family room which was more than ample in size and had a good sized bathroom.  I would describe the cleanliness of the room as excellent.  The staff were friendly & courtious.  The breakfast was more than ample.  The location is excellent in relation to Connolly station & bus depot.  Will definately stay again.,5,2013,08,08
219,very pleasent enviroment and staff,"booked into this hotel while attending the michael buble concert.
Very clean rooms, pleasent staff and great breakfest and straight accross the road from connolly train station. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone.",4,2013,08,08
219,"Good location, Room very small.",So when we arrived we were dealing with a lady who didn't really seem to know what she was doing. She took a phone call in the middle of us booking in and had a full on conversation for a good 5 mins or so which I thought was extremely rude I work in retail and would never do this! After the conversation she contined with are booking and informed us that we were not entitled to breakfast but if we wanted it we could pay in morning. We got to the room which was for 4 people it was so small barely enough room to walk in between the beds. So the next day we just went to a shop next to the hotel for breakfast. I happened to find my booking email and it did say we were entitled to free breakfast buffet but at this stage it was too late. I was planning another trip to Dublin at the end of August but I will be finding another hotel for that trip! ,3,2013,08,06
219,Aircouch from hotel is not Reliable,"We booked the aircouch from the hotel to the airport but the aircouch came earlier and nobody from reception called to inform us, so we missed the aircouch. This was not professional from the stuff. They dont care if the guests miss the aircouch.",3,2013,08,05
219,Great Barman named Paddy!,"Had to pass an hour waiting for a train across the road from this hotel at Dublin Connolly station so called into this hotel for a drink and was welcomed by an elderly barman who I think was called Paddy! ( hope you don't mind me saying you are elderly Paddy!) what a nice man. Friendly, welcoming, professional and great company. Was sorry to leave as would liked to have heard more stories about his trips to Bundoran and Donegal!! Well done North Star Hotel! You have a real star barman in Paddy! ",5,2013,08,03
219,Exceeded our expectations,"We travelled to Dublin from the UK and stayed in this hotel for two nights from the 29th July and were incredibly impressed.

We travelled from the airport via the airport link bus service into the city and were able to get off nearly right outside the hotel. We arrived before ten in the morning and the very polite staff on reception allowed us to leave a bag until our check-in time.

We decided to explore immediately, and found the main tourist and shopping area of Dublin began within a five minute walk, the location of the hotel seemed to be fantastic. We loved the city itself and there was plenty to explore.

When we returned to the hotel (an hour earlier than our check-in time), our room was already ready. Our room (271, I think), had two single beds and a double although we had only booked a double, but it did mean that we had ample space. We both liked the decor, the television was not brand new but it was a good size - we barely used it anyway since there was so much to go out and do. The bathroom was very clean and tidy, and fairly modern. The window in our room was less than thirty metres from the Dart train, and we cannot understand what other reviewers are moaning about. You could barely hear it with the window closed, and it seemed to have stopped by the time we came back to the room each night.

Our room also had free aircon and a free safe.

Our package included the breakfast, which is self-service, full-English and continental style food, all of which was great.

The room was cleaned and our bed made up while we were out.

Reception staff helped us with directions and provided us with a map on one occasion and were very helpful and polite - I really felt for them, seeing how impolite people could be toward them over the slightest problem (particularly fellow Brits and Americans).

We did not book direct and did plan on paying for the wi-fi, our only slight disappointment was that it seemed to be extortionately expensive, so we didn't bother, there are plenty of restaurants, pubs and fast food places where you can use it for free.

We loved the hotel and were really impressed and felt that it was great value for money. We would love to come back again, and if we come back to Dublin we will definitely.

Absolutely fantastic!",5,2013,08,02
219,Not what I expected......,"FREE wireless internet if you book directly......yes, it is free, but it doesn't work unless you are in the resident lounge. We tried using it in our room, but it only worked for about a minute at a time.....kind of difficult to search for near by activities. 
Reservation made for 4 people, only 3 towels in room. Had to ask for another set every evening!
Fitness center was flooded. Right next to train station, so it was very loud at times.
Front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Bartenders were very nice and friendly.",3,2013,08,01
219,Very misleading business practice?,"We booked our late July reservations in March as a part of a Groupon tour. When we arrived, they put us in a room that was literally under a commuter train track! When we asked to be moved, they were of course were completely booked and that was the only room left! Strange as we made our reservations so long ago but ... guess what? We could upgrade to a premium suite for 20 euro per night and they just so happen to have one of those rooms available! As a bonus, this room would have free wireless internet! The room was very nice and no way we could sleep with the train noise so we paid the 40 euro for two nights. What do you know? The internet does not work in that room! They allege they would have it fixed but of course never did...  I cannot believe this was a coincidence. 

And by the way, the fitness center just so happen to flood the night before we arrived. It may have, but I have a hard time believing that given the prior experience.

If you can, stay somewhere else. If you can't make certain you have a room reserved that is not near the train tracks...GUARANTEED, and don't count on internet use.

By the way don't eat in the restaurant. The portions are absurdly small and overpriced.",2,2013,07,31
219,North Star totally fabulous,"I stayed in the North Star hotel a number of times over the last few years all of my stay was excellent 
It's very close to the city centre area and nearby bus and train station 
The bar McCoy's was very cheat for a evening meal also the hotel is very reasonable price wise  ",5,2013,07,30
219,Cheap & cheerful!,"I stayed at this hotel twice and I will stay here any time I plan a trip to Dublin. 3 minute walk from Busaras and directly across the road from Connolly station. The first time we stayed here it was on the ground floor at the back of the hotel. It was a double room, a little dated but done the job! The second time was on the first floor at the front of the hotel. It was a double room again but a lot more modern and comfortable. More noise at the front with window open but they are well sound proofed and we had no problem sleeping! We stayed here for a concert in the O2 (the hotel offer a shuffle bus to and from the O2 during major shows for a fee of around ( euro) The second time we stayed here was for a concert in Phoenix park and it is within walking distance to the nearest bus to the park on O'Connell street. Very convenient for people wanting to stay in the heart of the city. Continental breakfast is included in the price of the room and around 7.50euro for a hot buffet breakfast. Comfortable beds. Worth the money. Definitely staying here again when I'm in dublin next!",5,2013,07,29
219,Enjoyed our stay,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Everyone was so nice and helpful. Really enjoyed having an evening drink and talking to the bartenders. This hotel is very clean, next door to the O'Connell train station. You are within walking distance of the city center, shops, restaurants/ pubs. We spent a little more money when we booked our room for the full Irish breakfast, which was very enjoyable. It included breads, jams, eggs, sausages,ham, potatoes,beans,a mixed fruit bar, cold cut meats, crereals, yogurts, several different kinds of juices and I'm sure I'm not mentioning some things. We did have dinner in the restaurant one night anditvwas very good. There was a conciere in the lobby who could give advise if needed. I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, there was no negatives about it. I would highly recommend this hotel. I would definitely stay there again if I was in the area.",5,2013,07,28
219,Great hotel and location,"Wow, just read Daniel1 from Belfast's review - and my stay and experience was completely different, excellent hotel and service.  They maybe thought they were in a 5 star hotel, this is an excellent 3 star hotel.  Good location and value for money especially if you book direct with the hotel and you will receive free continental breakfast and wi-fi, plus the rates are much cheaper going direct.  We initially booked on booking.com then I found out I could get the 2 nights cheaper by going direct to the hotel. A quick cancellation and re-booked direct with hotel and it saved me 100 euros!  Fantastic.  Our room was one of the Executive rooms on the 6th floor.  On my booking I requested a quiet room and they gave us a room which looked out onto the back of the hotel, we didn't hear any noise whatsoever the whole time we were there.  The room was immaculately clean, kettle, a mini fridge which was handy to keep bottles of water in and best of all air conditioning, in this hot weather it was a god send.    Our room also had a flat screen tv and one of the biggest beds I've ever slept in.   
We found all of the hotel staff very helpful in particular the Concierge who is located in the main foyer, there to provide assistance on tours, taxis, shows and generally advice on how to get about the City.  We ate in the resaturant and found the staff to be helpful and the food was very good, we both had the local fish dish,which I would definitely recommend if you like seafood.  Continental breakfast was included in our room rate and we partook of fresh ham,cheese, cereal and fruit juices.  The breakfast room was nicely laid out and very clean and tidy.  No idea what the last reviewer is going on about a smell of damp coming from the health club, some reviewers just love a good old moan eh!      We are a couple in our late 40's and have been to a lot of hotels in a lot of different countries and I would definitely recommend this as a very good 3 Star hotel.  And remember check the hotel website first because their rates and deals are much better than any other site as I luckily found out just in time!",4,2013,07,25
219,North Star Hotel - Dublin,"I booked the North Star Hotel - Dublin as recommend by Translink Travel in Belfast for Friday 12th - Sunday 14th July 2013.

When I went to book I asked what was the best hotel close to the train station & walking/travel distance to the main city cent shops & Phoenix Park Dublin as myself & my partner were going for a weekend away to relex, enjoy the sights & a concert.

On arrival first impressions were good as the hotel lobby look as if it was refurbished.
There were two gentlemen on reception one being the reception manager as per his name badge.

I decided to wait in line for the reception manager to check my partner & myself in as the other gentleman was confusing the guest he was attending to & he didn't seem to have much knowledge or training of the hotel & the reception manager kept having to say that he was wrong in front of the guest & give the right details.

The reception manager was very professional & looked after us well for information on the hotel  & directed us to his colleague in the hotel lobby for more information on tours directions & times.

Due to the room not being ready on arrival the hotel kept our suitcase in a secure area so we could go & enjoy some shopping & tours.

On return to the hotel that evening I found that the receptionist didn't speak much english & when asking about dinner times she said book now & be down for that time & we thought that with being told that dinner was served between 6:30pm - 10pm we didn't have to worry about a booking time as we didn't want to feel rushed when going for dinner as we wanted to freshen up before we went for dinner.

The room was ok hygiene wise but if you were looking a quiet night sleep I wouldn't recommend the room we were put in due to a train passing pay every 20 minutes or so.

When I asked was there any other room the staff member said that they were fully booked & couldn't do anything.

When we went for dinner I thought there would be someone to meet & greet all guests walking into the restaurant but instead my partner & myself had to approach the staff at the corner of the bar were they were gathered talking.
The restaurant was really quiet when we arrived with just a few people at the bar having drinks.
There was a table reserved for us but not at a good location as it was right next to the bar door entrance/exit to the main street.
I didn't ask to move tables as my partner didn't want me making a fuse as she said it would be embarrassing.
When the waiter came over to us to introduce himself & take our orders he didn't seem to know much about the menu & we were very restricted in what we could order even though we paid ¬£298.00 dinner bed & breakfast. 
The waiter had to keep coming & going to every time we asked something about the menu or what would he recommend.
When the food came out the waiter brought the wrong starter for one of us & as my partner ate I had to wait on the right one coming.
We asked for a jug of water three times of two different staff members & in the end I went to the bar myself to get it.
When I asked the waiter for something plan for my partner as she just wanted something like a chicken dinner as she was a plain eater the waiter said due to the dinner package we were on there would be a supplement charge of ¬£8 per person.
By the end of the meal both myself & my partner couldn't wait to leave the restaurant as the service & atmosphere wasn't great.
The staff looked as if they didn't want to be there at all.
Breakfast the following morning was great the only problem was the smell of dampness coming from the health club as you waited to be seated.
When I asked the staff member at breakfast what was wrong with the health club she took me to see what it was like & what happened.
There was one staff member I would recommend to be a manager as he was full of smiles with a great welcome & anything you asked for wasn't a problem for him to get you!
I didn't get his name but he was very tall well built with dark hair.
The second morning when we went down for breakfast it was a different story - no one meeted & greeted you as they were running about doing other things - one girl said just sit anywhere & didn't come back to see how we were!
When I asked for a poached egg it trying to get the lady to understand what I was saying was hard & she had to get another staff member to see to us!
Overall experience of the hotel wasn't great but if the service level changed & we got a better room we might go back due to location...
For the bedrooms I would recommend upgrading the tv's to flat screens & having a better selection of channels & maybe a system where you can view your bill from the bedroom.",2,2013,07,22
219,OK but needs to work on self-description and details,"We stayed here one night before flying out of Dublin Airport. My principal concern is that we booked it as as 'Top Secret' lastminute.ie property, where it was listed as a 'Fabulously trendy hotel close to O'Connell Street - 4*', but this description does not match the property. It's a 3* hotel, as it clearly indicates on its own website. And while it is close to O'Connell Street it is a former railway hotel directly opposite one of the major train and LUAS/DART stations in Dublin, and in a neighbourhood that responsibly needs to be called 'transitional.' 

It's clear they have spent a good amount of effort and money renovating the property, and the staff were very helpful. But we were first put in rooms close to and facing a busy DART track, and then one of us was put in a smoking room that reeked of smoke. Finally we were put in satisfactory rooms, but it took effort. 

Neither of us received the wake-up calls we booked.

The internet signal was somewhat weak - not strong enough for a Skype call, for example.

Again, the staff were really lovely (the porter wouldn't take a tip after our experience shifting around between rooms, and he was sincerely apologetic about this hassle...) but this hotel does not merit its description, on lastminute.ie at least (I am also taking this up with them).",3,2013,07,22
219,Convenient but be careful of noise,"Overall it's a good location across from train station and two blocks from bus station. But try to avoid rooms facing onto the street since there's  a lot of noise from trains and traffic. The bar is nice And the restaurant is satisfactory. Breakfast is Ample . I did have trouble with the Wifi since the passwords given to me were the wrong ones. The room was large , bed comfortable and the bathroom  was also superior. There are only a few TV channels available including BBC(I thought this was Ireland) . A very small , limited selection. Also the screen was quite small.
But I would stay there again.",3,2013,07,19
219,Great hotel,"Stayed here on 16th July for one night with my daughter,we were going to see Michael  Buble in the  O2.We travelled by bus & found it was just a ten minute walk to the hotel.The hotel is very clean,we had booked a twin but our room had 2 singles & a double,we were able to book a shuttle bus to & from the O2 which was great but I think it's only a ten minute walk.We ate in the restaurant Mc Gettigans but was a bit disappointed with the food.The beds were very comfy,slept very well no noise,breakfast very good,good selection.Checked out next day & hotel kept our luggage,so we could spend the day shopping,the main shopping area is about a fifteen minute walk.All I can say try it you won't be disappointed.",5,2013,07,18
219,Fantastic hotel. Would return,"Just got back from a few nights here. Cant fault it on anything. All the staff were very helpful. Very clean and modern hotel. There are reports on here of train noise but we never got disturbed. The beds are sooo comfy. Never slept as well and didnt want to get out of it. 

If you looking for hotel in dublin stay here. Would return and recommend. ",5,2013,07,17
219,Ask for an updated room,"Our travel agent booked this hotel for us.  Even though the reviews I had read were not positive, I trusted our agent.  Our room was down what seemed to be our own hallway and to our surprise, directly under the train line.  We had to book two rooms as we had 4 traveling together and we all wouldn't fit in one room.  Both our rooms could hear the train go by but one of our rooms literally shook when it passed.  We found out after our first night that we could upgrade (for a fee of course) to the other side of the hotel which had been updated with air-conditioning and we assumed would be much quieter!  We spent a small fortune on this hotel already and excepted at least air!  We had to ask for fans for our rooms as they were stuffy and the windows opened to a little courtyard like area with no breeze.  The breakfast was wonderful and the location directly across the street from the train station was the only reason we booked this hotel.  For the price we paid, it was not a great experience though.",3,2013,07,16
219,"Decent location, good value, has family rooms for 4","The North Star is a large B&B located across from the Connolly train station. It is easy to get to by train or bus.  If you are coming from the airport, take bus 747 to Connolly. 6‚Ç¨ for adults 3‚Ç¨ for children under 14. A cab ride is 20‚Ç¨.
The Family rooms have 1 double and two twins. A rare find in Europe.  We purchased the breakfast with our booking but found out it was only for the continental portion. The full Irish hot breakfast buffet will cost you 8.50‚Ç¨. 
The location was a bit of a walk from the Temple Bar District and the sites of Dublin, about a 15-20 minute walk but we never minded it. 
When we asked our boys what their favorite hotel of the entire trip was, this was it. They are both 14 and liked the sauna, the private sitting room and fitness room.  I found this hotel to be perfect for a budget minded family and found the entire staff very friendly and helpful.",4,2013,07,16
219,Very nice hotel,"Only stayed the one night but thought it was a great hotel. The room was spacious and the bed was so comfortable, had a lovely nights sleep. The food was excellent and plenty of choice. Cannot find fault with this hotel at all. Would recommend it to anyone",4,2013,07,15
219,Wonderful experience,"My family, 7 adults, travelled thru France and Ireland this June (2013).  This hotel was excellent.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Staff was exceptional.  Onsite restaraunts served quality food for a reasonable price, including the breakfasts.  Travelling with 7, and trying to get the right number of beds, was how we found the hotel.  

Thank you Brian & your entire staff.
The Morgans, Loxahatchee, Florida",5,2013,07,14
219,great place to stay,"What a great hotel this is to stay in , we were greeted at reception by a lovely lady called Maria, so polite, and extremely helpful , we were too early for check in but it was no problem the hotel kept our bags for us and Maria gave us a map explaining were we were at and how to get to places. the decor of hotel was lovely very comfortable beds everything we needed and as it was the week of really sunny weather it was brillant as our room had brillant ac. The breakfast was great as was the service so. this hotel is so conveient to everythin its directly across the road from train station and a five min walk from bus station and less than ten min walk from o connell street which makes it ideal for any traveller i would highly recommend The North Star and just want to add that i got a better price and choice of room booking directly with the hotel not any of the comparison sites",5,2013,07,11
219,great!,"We had a great stay at the North Star! Brilliant food, very comfortable beds (a bit too comfortable!), the room was spacious, and the only thing stopping us from staying again was the fact that there wasn't a room available for 3 of us. Fantastic!",4,2013,07,11
219,Fabulous Hotel,"Myself and my partner stayed here last week and I highly recommend it to everyone. The hotel has been recently refurbished and looks fantastic. Our room was large ,spacious ,the decor is lovely also the bed is really comfortable and the room itself was well equipped with plenty of tea,coffee etc and had a large television with about 8 or 9 channels. The bathroom again was nicely decorated and quite large. The staff here are really nice from the very pleasant receptionist who checked us in to the accommodation staff,  every single person had a smile for you which can be rare in the hotel industry these days. 
We ate in the restaurant on our first night I had the fish and chips which was very good and my partner had the pasta carbonara with pulled pork which was divine!!! We also received a glass of complimentary prosecco each which was a nice bonus. The breakfast in the morning was really nice as well and had loads of choice so I can't understand some of the previous reviews saying there wasn't much considering they had all the usual continental breakfast choices that you find in most hotels! Also if you don't want to eat in the hotel restaurant there is a fabulous restaurant on Talbot Street just 5 mins away called Le Bon Crubeen I would highly recommend it.
The location of this hotel is superb you're 10 minutes walk from O Connell Street, Connolly Station is across the road, Bus Aras is 2 mins away and you can jump on the Luas within 2 mins so you couldn't have more transport options available to you! 
The only really minor thing i could complain about is the noise of the trains although you get used to them after a while ( this isn't the hotels fault)and thankfully they don't run after 11ish so you still get decent sleep.
All in all I really loved this hotel and for the price you pay you really won't get better in Dublin.",5,2013,07,10
219,Convenient to train and bus transport,"I met a family of Brazilian friends at Dublin airport and took them to the North Star Hotel where they had booked for three nights. For anyone travelling by train or bus to other towns in Ireland, this Hotel is very convenient, directly opposite Connolly Station (which has a tram connection to the other main city station, Heuston), and just a few minutes from the main bus terminal for rural routes. It is within easy walking distance of Dublin' main street, O'Connell Street.

This is one of Dublin's oldest hotels, recently refurbished to a high three-star standard, and a good level of cleanliness. The older building, on the street front, has no elevator, so luggage has to be carried up two short flights of stairs to the first floor. The rear of the building is much newer and has an elevator. The hotel has a small car-park, with a helpful concierge. A separate larger car-park can be found behind the railway station.

The bar and dining facilities were highly recommended, and the staff very knowledgeable and helpful. 

When booking, my friends had omitted to make it clear that they wanted one double room and one twin room, so at check-in were assigned two double rooms, but the Reception staff willingly found an alternative. 

The rooms are large and comfortably furnished with hospitality tray but no frig. My friends were delighted to be able to take an evening stroll right up to O'Connell Street and experience the city centre life. But they were disappointed at the charge for use of Wi-Fi. 

They had been hoping for a room with a tiled floor rather than carpets, due to an allergy problem, but that is impossible to find in an older hotel in this country. If that is a requirement it would be essential to enquire before booking.

The location could be a bit noisy due to the busy street and the frequent trains which pass over a bridge that is very close to the hotel - but the trains stop well before midnight.

The positive things about this hotel are the price and the location. Also, the shuttle service that is provided by Paddywagon Tours from this and other city centre hotels to and from Dublin airport.

At Dublin Airport we were able to purchase a one-day Family ticket for bus and train, for two adults and four children for ‚Ç¨17.50. This does not include the 'Luas' tram or the 'Hop On Hop Off' buses.",4,2013,07,09
219,"Good value, nice room, loud at night.","My wife and I stayed here for three nights and had no real complaints, based on the rate we received from hotels.com.  The room was quite large, featuring a sitting area with desk and a spacious section with a king-sized bed.  The bathroom was nice, if you overlooked the dingy, shrinking caulking around the bathtub.  Room is not air conditioned and Internet was not included in our rate.  I paid for three days' worth of Internet (at around 40 Euros--ouch!), but it was only for one device.  The staff, however, gave us another code free of charge, which was much appreciated.  Our room faced the railroad tracks, which could be problematic for some, but our biggest complaint was the music from the nearby bar, which went on until the wee hours.  The location is very good, as Temple Bar/ Trinity College was only a 10 minute walk.",3,2013,07,08
219,Full Marks!,"Myself & 2 others stayed here in mid June. It is clean, spacious, centrally located, great breakfast, reasonably priced and more importantly the staff are great! I cannot praise the staff highly enough.......  especially the young bartender who makes brilliant cocktails!! We were going to a concert so they were a welcome way to start the night!! - along with the good food served in the bar....
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin for any reason and any amount of time. An all rounder.",4,2013,07,07
219,Shame it was only one night!,"It was the end of a week's stay in Ireland's South-West. We were getting a morning boat back to Holyhead, so we looked for somewhere on the port side of the city centre and found the North Star.

We were allocated a very large and comfortable room at the back of the hotel on the sixth floor. OK, the view wasn't the best but, being at the back, it was wonderfully quiet (especially for a city centre hotel) and we had a marvellous night's sleep in what must be a contender for the biggest bed in the world. The facilities in the room were excellent, even having a fridge.

I can't comment on the quality of the food as we ate out in the evening, and needed an early start for the boat, but we did have a night cap in the very attractive bar. Service throughout from the friendly staff couldn't be faulted.

The location is excellent, being central but not so central as to be disturbed by city centre revellers overnight and, for those without a car, couldn't be closer to Amiens Street station (oops, showing my age there).

Our only regret was that it was only a one night stopover but, certainly if, in the future, we arrange a break just in Dublln itself, the North Star would be our first choice.",5,2013,07,05
219,perfect hotel,"Me and my friends, we stayed in this hotel. Unfortunately we were here just one night. The hotel was clean and beautiful. Restaurant was excellent. Rooms bit older but clean and nice. but wi-fi was terrible expensive. anyway I can recommend this hotel to all of the guests.",5,2013,07,05
219,weekend away,"very nice hotel, very warm and friendly staff, excellent food and would defiantly stay again.
only issue we had was the room we stayed was noisy if the window was open as it is on the lower floor and near to the bins etc, the window had to be left open as the air con didn't work, but staff did give us a fan",5,2013,07,04
219,"Lovely, central hotel.","We stayed here for one night for a concert. The hotel was lovey, very trendy and clean. All the staff were helpful ( they organised a shuttle to and from the concert) and the food was great. Ill defiantly be going again! ",4,2013,07,03
219,Hidden Gem,"We stayed here on our first time to Dublin, we got off the bus and found the hotel. From the outside, I was worried, it didn't look like a hote but a pub. Granted it was under renovation when we went which meant one bar was closed but there are plenty in Dublin - no need to stay in your hotel. 
When we went in we were surprised, lovely decor, had a real boutique feel to it. We arrived at 11am and check in isn't until 2/3pm I can't remember. I asked the front of house if we could store our bags but she said our room was available now which we were very grateful of. We booked a premier room which was large and comfy. The bed was enormous and we had use of a fridge. We had a little balcony which would have been nice in the summer. We overlooked the train station which was noisy but not an issue. Our whole stay was really pleasant. Upon check out at 11am our flight home wasn't until 11pm so we stored 3 bag (one of which was no charge and only 3euros per bag) the staff still allowed use of the main bar which is supposed to be guests only I think. 
We didn't have breakfast here as we wished to see the city. 
Fantastic hotel in a fantastic city. Cannot wait to return!",5,2013,07,01
219,Wi-Fi Charges,"Very clean, comfortable hotel Near the train station, and I love the rumbling sound. I am pretty sure there are no trains between about 11pm and 6:30 am, so will be able to sleep. The staff here is very nice, and there is a very helpful concierge.  My ONLY gripe is the charges for connecting to the Internet -- ‚Ç¨4.95 an hour or 24 hrs for ‚Ç¨10.95.",4,2013,06,26
219,wecoming,"We stayed here in April. It had parking , which turned out to be valet because the car park is small . The place was clean. The staff welcoming. And we had a very comfortable gigantic bed. We enjoyed our stay. The food was very nice. It seemed a little over priced but when we looked at other restaurants it turned out that it wasn't over priced. They had our favourite wheat beer on tap. Never seen it on tap before It was lovely. Bartenders where nice to talk to. Were not far from city could walk easy 20 mins or bus and train and taxi right across road. I would go back. We booked through lidl including breakfast. Breakfast was downstairs , it was hot and basic. We had plenty. Funny we stayed in the Hilton the following week and both preferred it here. It wasn't as new or as big but it was just better.",4,2013,06,24
219,Very pleased,"Booked the hotel room online, was a bit wary of it due to it being so cheap. Was more than pleasantly surprised. The rooms were a good size, clean, nicely decorated etc. Dont get me wrong there were a few wonky curtain rails and the likes, but overall it was far from a nasty hostel that it could have turned out to be for the price. The breakfast in the morning was v. nice, plenty of selection. The location of the place is brilliant, right opposite the train station and its got a spar/centra nearby as well as being attached to a pub which serves dinner. I was staying there for a concert, its so near the 02 its great! You can pay extra for a hotel organised shuttle but its cheaper to get the nearby luas or just walk if you're in the mood! Overall I would definately recommend the place. There was construction going on there the time I stayed so I can only presume it has improved even more since!",4,2013,06,24
219,Another Dublin treasure,"Not being able to get accommodation at our usual hotel, the North Star seemed to offer what we wanted, and it proved itself admirably.  The reception staff were very welcomming and made the check-in process effortless.  Our luggage was taken to our room up several floors (4) and handled with care.  The room was typical of most hotel rooms and provided us with everything we needed.  The TV remote wasn't functioning as it should so the staff replaced the TV within a short time.  Whilst the rain line ran near the hotel, any noise from passing trains was minimal and nothing to worry about.  The hotel offered a good variety of meals although the prices were a bit towards the top end.  The dining facilities and bar were very well presented and were a pleasure to be in.  The only down-side was the charge made to store luggage if you needed to.  Perhaps making luggage storage after check-out free would make the stay just that much better.
Overall, a good, well appointed hotel in easy reach of the bus depot and train station (across the road) and a reasonable walk to the centre of the city.  We will certainly have The North Star on our list for the next time we're in Dublin.",4,2013,06,20
219,"Good location , Great for a short break !","Number of travellers - 3
Room - Triple Room (3 single beds). (Breakfast included)

Room:
Positives:
Air Conditioning.
Nice modern decor.
Clean.

Negatives:
Bathroom small.
I found the bed itself to be very lumpy and un-comfortable. 
You can hear everyone talking when passing your room. 
Lack of wardrobe space (ok for a weekend away but not long term)

On the hotel itself:
Do not order room service ! The worst i have ever experienced in any hotel. (Story written below)
Good location (few mins walk to nearest Luas)
Friendly staff.
Food in the resturant very gourmet style. Very tasty.
Breakfast was average like most Irish hotels.
The one vending machine for minerals was never restocked so i would recommend buying your bits for the room is a shop near the hotel.

Room service review: In the room there was a small selection for room service in the evening time from 9pm. Stated a few types of pizza and 3 sandwich selections which were down as gourmet. I rang to order the ''Wicklow ham salad sandwich''. I was informed by the night porter it was not available. So i asked for the chicken and he said he could do chicken and ham. Made no sense and then he asked me to read out the menu selection. Anyway , it took approx 20mins for the sandwich to arrive and when it did , it was stale bread , little butter , no mayo , and about 6 pieces of ham and chicken. After i asked for just ham. Brought it back to reception as i couldnt eat it. I explained nicely that it was stale and he continued to argue that it was not. I just asked for it to be removed from the bill. 

All in all, this hotel is good for a short stay. Would eat at the resturant again. There is a beer garden which is great for smokers. As this hotel is a non smoking hotel. I would stay here again for its location;",4,2013,06,15
219,Noisy,"I stayed for one night while on a business trip as my usual hotel was full.

The hotel is in a very busy location across the road from Connelly station and a short walk from the bus stop. First impressions of the hotel from the outside were good despite the appearance of the surrounding area.

I had to wait a while a check-in while the receptionists sorted out the coach party who had arrived in front of me. When I was checked-in the receptionist was very friendly and explained everything to me.

I was in room 206, which is to the front of the hotel facing the main road. I was glad I only had an overnight bag as the room is reached via 3 staircases with a security door between the second and third one.

The room was very modern and perfectly comfortable, the only downside being it didn't have air conditioning. The room was hot, so I had to open the window. The road outside is very busy and noisy. I could still hear it even with earplugs in.

I had continental breakfast included in my rate which was pretty disappointing. It consisted of a cerales, fruit juice, small selection of meat and cheese, fruit and yoghurt, Irish soda bread and toast. There were no croissants, pastries or rolls. However, the staff were very friendly and attentive. The full Irish breakfast looked good.

Overall, the staff the were excellent and the room was comforatble but noisy. Go for the full Irish breakfast rather than the continental.",3,2013,06,14
219,Cheap convenient and great location if going to the o2!!,"Stayed here with my sister for a concert in the O2 in October 2012. Very convenient to Hueston station as we got the Luas to either the Connolly line or Busarus so were able to get a day pass for the Luas and used it to go in shopping and to get the Luas up to the O2. Found the staff friendly, cheap to stay there, comfortable and clean. Couldn't have spoken highly of it. Booked here again for a concert in February 2013 for six friends and myself so I booked 2 rooms. The reception had been moved downstairs and working  there was the front office manager and a girl in training and found out it was only her second day! The manager wasn't particularly nice to the girl and felt like it was a chore if the girl asked her for help. Was told the times for breakfast and check out. Next morning just myself and two girls of the went down for breakfast. Waited to be seated and were practically ignored by the two ladies working so we proceeded into the breakfast room. One lady then told us no breakfast is finished and I said I was told half ten, it was ten past ten at this moment in time. The lady said ""No that's not true breakfast is finished at ten"" I felt i was being accused of lying and said to her ""I'm hardly lying"" she got a bit flustered and was like oh I meant that whoever told you wasn't correct and you can eat BUT BE QUICK. Didn't really like this attitude as we had been told ten thirty at the desk and there was people still having breakfast so I don't really know what the issue was. Would definitely return but as working in a hotel myself that is no way to treat a new member of staff or treat guests. Cheap and convenient if going to a concert in the O2.",4,2013,06,12
219,flying visit,"Not my first choice but will stay again when in Dublin. Very friendly staff, excellent breakfast, clean bedroom but in need of a refresh. Very convenient for all areas with train,tram and bus all outside the front door.",4,2013,06,11
219,Waiting...,"I stayed here with some friends during an overnight stay in Dublin last year. The staff were friendly and the rooms were good- we stayed in a suite. My complaint, and reasoning for lowering my rating level is because we rang down to say that our plug sockets and lights were not working, and the receptionist said that they would get someone from maintenance to come and sort it- we are still waiting. Thankfully, we sorted it out ourselves due to the fuse box being in the cupboard. Aside from that, we were happy enough with the facilities.",3,2013,06,10
219,Amazing!!,"Stayed here for one night. Staff couldn't have been more helpful especially restaurant. 
Room was beautiful, furnishings sublime. Very central to all tourist spots. 
Breakfast in bed no problem 
Shuttle bus to airport only 5 euro.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,06,07
219,Nice Hotel in Good Location,"We stayed at the North Star for 4 nights and it was a nice experience.  We stayed on the 3rd floor facing the southeast and there was some noise with the train nearby but it was not bad.  The staff was very helpful including the concierge with getting us where we needed to be.  The location was fantastic.  Very close to the various train and bus stations and an acceptable distance away from Temple Bar.  We did eat breakfast their only once as it was kind of pricey but still decent.

Overall, we had a pleasant experience and would recommend the North Star to anyone travelling to Dublin.",4,2013,06,02
219,"Good location, not as noisy as you would think","We stayed at the North Star for 6 nights and it was a very pleasant experience.  Our room was on the 7th floor facing away from the Connolly station and the only noise we heard was the occasional loud group passing by on the street below.  The room was advertised to have a ""terrace"" - it was really a small balcony that we didn't use at all because it was small and felt a little on the shaky side.  Opening the door to the balcony was nice though for fresh air.  The room was very clean, the king bed was comfortable, the room's temperature was easy to control, and the bathroom was fairly modern.  The bathtub was longer than what I would've expected and worked well for a nice soaking after a day of getting lost walking around Dublin.  There were no washcloths, but this was my first international trip from the US, I wasn't sure if that was a peculiarity of the hotel or just Americans use washcloths.  There are hand towels and bath towels.  The hotel is close to Connolly and Busaras stations so we rode the luas train system back and forth across Dublin.  It was a short hop to the Temple Bar area where there are plenty of restaurants from which to choose.  The restaurant attached to the hotel was pretty good and had the best Guinness of any of the locations we tried.  The beer garden was a nice place to sit with a pint and have casual conversation.  The hotel staff were helpful and friendly.  Reserve your reservations online and the wifi access is free.",5,2013,06,01
219,great service,"we visited this hotel between May26 and May30 with a wheelchair guest.The staff in every part of the hotel were quick to help us get around,the rooms were very comfortable and clean,and the food was beautiful.Would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to dublin,as it is close to public transport, and we will definetly be returning soon.",5,2013,05,30
219,Good value and location,"Had 2 nights here at a very good price.

Location is great. You fall out of the hotel and straight into Connely Station, rail, light rail and trams. Temple Bar is 3 - 4 stops on the tram.

The rooms were good with safes, tea making facility (no 1 requirement for us), air-con and everything else you may need. There's also a vert helpful concierge in the reception.

Breakfast is English buffet with a fair variety to suit most expectations.

Transfers to the airport from the front door - 5 Euros.

Would book again.",4,2013,05,27
219,Nice hotel but just one proablem,"I've stay there with 2 friends of mine everything was great until we rent a car and want to park there. the price is not bad but we sow the guy who 's looking after the cars telling to a old woman that he has problems with money and he is very poor and the old woman gave him few euro's. it was Sunday afternoon when we left and we just want to avoid that guy . I'm traveling for a long time all over the world and I have just a few things to say:
I'm driving much better then him
He has a bad English for someone who work&live in Ireland
And must important thing :IT'S A 4 STAR HOTEL .WHY PERSONS LIKE THAT ARE WORKING IN SUCH A NICE HOTEL AND THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS EVERY DAY.",4,2013,05,27
219,Great location and good staff,"I stayed here for a long weekend with friends the hotel is a bit of a dump from the outside and it was one of them,why did I book this,but moment you walk in it is lovely the bar area is very nice and rooms we had were recently refurbished,also the breakfast was alright so no complaints,Its only a 15 minute walk to temple bar area with a few pub stops on the way.I did have a problem at hotel in which i made a idiot of myself,but while the issue was getting resolved the manager took us in the bar area and offered us what we wanted,which was very nice of them,cant fault the place and would stay here again although I feel ashamed if I walked back in there,so to the manager and car park attendants I apologize.",5,2013,05,26
219,'Perfect Location',"Me and my wife stayed at this hotel for three nights, the hotel is located perfectly in an ideal part of the city that makes a great base for exploration, most sites can be reached within 10-15 mins on foot. The hotel is quite pleasant throughout but appears to be a bit dated. The staff were very friendly and helped us with all our questions and or concerns. Check in was very efficient and easy and the lobby is quite roomy and has plenty of room to it and relax if it is busy during check in/out. To reach the elevators you need to drag your luggage down a hallway about 40m long and will need to negotiate a few sets of stairs, this is a bit of a 'drag' and may be difficult with heavy bags, or old legs.

The room was pleasant, clean and well furnished but could do with a refresh.  The bed was comfortable and the room had plenty of room to move about. The bathroom was very clean and modern and had room to move. The free WIFI worked fine and there was a PC and printer available in the guest lounge for printing documents, this was broken during our stay so the staff helpfully printed our documents for us. 

The breakfast was of an acceptable standard and had all the usual findings of a hotel breakfast, the dinning room can get a bit crowded and the tables are set out a tad awkwardly. The lobby connects to the main restaurant, we did not visit, however it looked very nice and upmarket.

Our room overlooked the roof tops and railway and the view was a bit of an eye saw so don't expect a room with a good view. I found this hotel to be very nice, the staff are professional and courteous and the location can not be faulted.",4,2013,05,26
219,For a work conference,"I had waited too long to book my hotel but it was sheer luck that during this recent conference, I got a great price for the room.  You know when a conference is in town, you can expect to sometimes pay up to $500USD a night so I was shocked I was able to get this room for so much cheaper.  So then I spread the word to the other members of my company who like me, waited too long to book the main hotel.  The Lord Elgin was good, clean, close to where I needed to be.  It served all the purposes that I needed it for.",3,2013,05,22
219,Annoying attitude,"Location is good. But they are ripping you off in every way they can. Wifi 3,-/20 min. Breakfast 10,95. You can get a worthy breakfast with HUGE coffees in a cafe across the street.
When leaving in afternoon or evening be prepared for paying for leaving luggage to luggage room. 3,-/bag. Or late checkout 10,-/h.

I hate the attitude that we will take money just because we can.

They do have LAN outlets in the room (2 pcs) but no signal in them. And no other wifis seem to be available.

But I can tell you that the amount of pillows in the bed is overwhelming. I wish I fit in there too.",3,2013,05,21
219,Thoroughly recommended for a stay in Dublin,"We booked a triple room for the weekend of the Heineken Cup weekend & couldn't fault the hotel. We used the airlink bus service from the airport which stopped round the corner from the hotel entrance & is only 10 euro return. Booking in was fast & efficient & we found the room spacious, clean & comfortable. We headed out & caught the train directly opposite the hotel & four stops later got off at Lansdowne Road.
Brakfast in the morning was very good & set us up for the day. We walked to O'Connell Street & found the Spire just a 5 minute walk away. There are plenty of pubs nearby. Mother Kellys is full of locals & was good fun & O'Sheas had a live band on Friday night & the place was rocking. 
All in all a very pleasant stay for resonable cost.",5,2013,05,20
219,Very disappointed,"Stayed there Friday night,hotel was great but you have to do something with the car park attendant ,Stefan , English language is a mystery for him,slow and really bad driver.
I stayed there before,great car park attendant Kevin and a big guy (foreign lad)they were great but that specimen will never drive my car again.
If you love your car don't go to North Star Hotel.",4,2013,05,18
219,A great surprise,"I've stayed in a number of hotels in Dublin recently but this was far above the rest of them. The location is great as its across from Connolly train station and the bus station is just down the road. It've very close to O'Connell Street and Henry Street for shopping.The hotel is wonderfully decorated and it's so much bigger than it initially looks. I had my breakfast included which was great. It was a buffet with lots of hot food options such as eggs and sausages as well as cereal. I really enjoyed it both mornings. The only fault that I would complain about was that I could not for the life of me get the Wifi to work. It was included in my room rate but I think otherwise you have to pay for it. Most other hotels offer free wifi, no exception, and its a breeze to connect, I really think that this needs to be worked on. My room was facing the train tracks which could be a little noisy from 8am onwards but it didn't bother me. I also didn't like that they charged to keep my bag for the day after I checked out. Otherwise I had a very enjoyable stay.",5,2013,05,17
219,Top hotel!!,"Stayed here for the Beyonce concert and it was fab!! Staff v friendly, ESP the lil older man at the bar!! Great laugh! Rooms v clean and beds v comfortable.. We were a group of 4 girls and all loved it!",4,2013,05,16
219,Overall OK but minor points need addressing.,"Stayed here on business with a colleague and whilst first impressions are ok there are definitely things that need addressing. 
The reception gives a good impression and the staff were very welcoming. Our office had requested rooms higher up and away from the trains so as to be quieter but as the hotel was fully booked and we were given a room on the third floor facing a street at the back othe hotel. Also in what appears to be the smoking portion of the hotel as I could smell it in the corridors. 
The rooms have been renovated although some of the furniture still looks a little dated. I had a small double bed and a single bed in my room and unfortunately the double was probably one of the worst mattresses I've slept on. There were two large depressions on either side of the bed and a ridge down the middle which made for a very uncomfortable nights sleep. 
The main door to the room had a rather large gap at the bottom which allowed me to hear everything happening in the corridor with startling clarity as well as being able to transfer the smell of smoke from adjoining rooms with ease. 
The bathroom unfortunately had mould in the grout between the tiles both on the floor and in the shower. 
Breakfast in the hotel was good and the food at the buffet was nicely presented. 
Lastly a word about the area. Myself and my female colleague were advised not to walk in the area at night. This came from a friend who lived in Dublin for 12 years and also from a business associate. We ended up getting taxis to and from dinner in the evening",3,2013,05,15
219,10/10,"Couldn't fault this accommodation at all. We only booked into a standard room and it was so much more than we expected, especially for the price! We were astonished that the hotel is only a 3 star. Staff were very friendly and happy to help - the concierge was lovely and advised us to go to a few places which we thoroughly enjoyed. The discounted 'hop-on, hop-off' bus tickets from the hotel made our stay more enjoyable as we were able to visit so many places such as the zoo, trinity college, the Guinness storehouse and many more. The breakfast was great value for money and there was a wide variety of choice. Just wish we had stayed for more than 2 nights.Thanks North Star!",5,2013,05,13
219,Convenience and Comfort,"I fly to the U.S. twice a year to visit family and often stay at this hotel before my flight or after arriving back to Ireland. The location is excellent and its close proximity to Busaras is a plus for me, as I have to use the bus system to return to Limerick City, where I live. It's also only a short walk to O'Connell Street or to the quays.  There is an airport shuttle to and from the airport and it runs several times per day, which is a big plus for me.  Breakfast was brought up to my room on one occasion because I had to check-out (for an early flight) before breakfast-serving time. There are some who might complain because of the noise the trains make (the hotel is situated across from Connolly Station) but if one is going to stay in a hotel across from a rail station, then one must expect there will be a little noise. However, I did not find the train sounds to be distracting at all and enjoyed my view of Connolly Station's Italianate clock tower.  Though the hotel is older, the rooms are very comfortable, clean, and recently updated and refurbished -- including the bathrooms. There is no lift from the reception to the 1st floor, (though, there are lifts from the 1st floor to the other floors)  but the concierge is on hand to help with bags. I've stayed at several Dublin hotels and this is by far my favorite.",5,2013,05,13
219,Trip to Dublin,"Great hotel, great price, decent location ( we alked everywhere, about 20mins to temple bar area) Very clean and modern room, very spacious but the heating didint work ( but staff put heater in room) and the sound of the trains could somethines be annoying, but didnt affect our sleep, maybe the guiness helped with that!",4,2013,05,12
219,Overnight in Dublin,The staff were friendly and helpful. Got upgraded to a better room at check in for no extra cost. Terrific room with balcony and good view. Extremely comfortable. Car park right beside hotel at ‚Ç¨8 for the night was very handy. Easy walk to O'Connell Street. Opposite Connolly station(mainline and suburban trains) and close to Busaras(main bus station). Had two meals in the bar and the food was very good. We would definatly stay again.,5,2013,05,11
219,Nice stay,"Me and my partner stayed in this hotel for 1 night in the Easter weekend. 
The hotel is situated near the station, so there are always taxi drivers across the street. It is a short walk (less then 10 minutes) to O'Connell Street. The staff at reception was very friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 1st floor facing the street, but there was no noise from the traffic. The rooms are quite large and modern. The bathroom is also very modern and clean. We did have some difficulties turning off the heating so it was very hot in the room and eventually we had to open a window to be able to sleep. The breakfast area is quite dark but cozy. Plenty of choice. The pub is also very nice, we had a lovely meal there. We would stay in this hotel again and recommend it to friends.",4,2013,05,10
219,Alright.,"There's nothing splendid about the hotel itself. It's old, and that's to be expected for a building in this location. With that comes creaky floors, thin walls, narrow hallways, etc. They've done great work at keeping it upgraded. Per room climate control, newer fixtures and paint, but you can still tell it's an old hotel. 

The location of this place is great. The Conolly car park is a two minute walk, and there was plenty of spots on a Sunday evening. It's also central to food, pubs, transport and more. 

There's apparently wifi, but we weren't given the username and password. The phone also didn't have instructions for calling the front desk to ask. We just used the last bit of our data plan since we were heading back to the states the next day.

Overall, no complaints, but it's just an average property!",3,2013,05,08
219,Fab Stay,"We stayed for one night with a living social deal-getting us a Premier club suite for more or less half price. This excellent hotel is very well situated near both Connelly rail and bus stations and was by far the best we have stayed in.
The service was excellent from check in to free cocktail at the residents bar, outstanding fully cooked breakfast in comfortable relaxed dining area and late 2pm check-out. A spacious well lit room with an air of luxury from the huge memory foam bed, wall mounted large flat-screen tv and superb bathroom with bath/shower made staying here a pleasure.
We recommend the North Star Hotel most highly and will definately be staying again-a totally satisfying experience-oh and a great night's sleep as well! :)",5,2013,05,07
219,Wow!! One of the best hotels around,"After pre-booking a small double room, upon arrival we were upgraded to the James Joyce Suite with panoramic views of Dublin from our private balcony. It was a huge modern room which was immaculately clean. Breakfast was lovely too. Would definitely recommend to anybody!",5,2013,05,07
219,lovely hotel,"what a lovely hotel.only stayed one night but how we would have loved to have stayed longer. paintwork outside a little bit tired but don't let it put you off - brilliant inside,.beautiful furniture, decor lovely and spotless. we had a room on 7th floor fabulous.perfect location for trains and buses.so easy to get to everywhere. can't wait to visit Dublin again , this will definatly be our hotel of choice  from now on.",5,2013,05,07
219,Really fabulous place to stay,"Just returned from a weekend away and I have to say this hotel was amazing and by far the nicest place I have stayed in a long time. We had got a very good price for our stay and as we would only be sleeping here we were not to bothered about what it would be like, the hotel is directly opposite the train station so it was easy to find, we checked in and got our keys and were given directions to the lift, when we got in the lift we seen that level 7 was the premier club suite and we thought we had been given the wrong room maybe but we had not, on arriving in the room we couldn't believe our eyes it was what I can only describe as 5 star luxury with a very huge bed and the room was quite big and had everything in it that you might need. The bed was the most comfortable bed I'd ever slept in it was like sleeping in a cloud. The only 1 thing negative I can say is that the heat in the room was unbearable and had to sleep on top of the be's with the window left open which was a bit noisy apart from that full marks for the North Star especially the soloro cocktails in the bar. ",5,2013,05,06
219,Business Trip to Dublin,"I stayed at this hotel on the 25th April. It's clean, full of character, front dest staff are excellent, they let me check in early as i was off to the races, very helpful, following morning i needed a quick breakfast and this was organised also, even though the restaurant was very busy. Don't listen to any of the negative comments, if you want a clean friendly hotel, well located, you won't go far wrong.",5,2013,05,05
219,Great Hotel,"Had an amazing stay here.  On arrival we were upgraded to a premier room with a private balcony. Room was spacious, clean and well equipped, Couldn't fault the hotel had a great stay.  You don't even notice the noise from the railway. Location is 5 mins from O'Connell street very central,",5,2013,05,01
219,"Lovely room,food only ok","stayed in this hotel as part of theatre package, which included B&B and evening meal, our room was really nice as it was a suite, very impressed as wasn't expecting this. lovely bathroom and very clean spacious room. Dinner was very disapointing unfortunately, Menus were on table when we sat down so we began deciding what to have, only to find out we couldn't order off that menu as there was a special per-theatre menu, which was terrible, 3 choices on menu, one being bangers and mash!!! which i haven't eaten since i was a child, i kindly asked a very nice waiter could we order from the other menu and would pay extra if nessesary, he checked it out and said we could. I had Pate to start which was ok, very salty and the chicken burger for main, which had no real flavour. Breakfast was good. would recommend this hotel for B&B only, as evening menu is definately not four star standard.",4,2013,04,30
219,An hotel full of character,"I find some of the things that a tiny number of contributors complain about amusing, since they are the very things I like about this hotel and the reason why I always stay there when I visit Dublin. The fact that the railroad passes directly through the hotel is one of the things which give it character and make it quirky. The trains do not run through the night, so what's the big deal? It also reminds me of the Station Hotel, Ayr, where you can look out of your window directly onto the main platforms and watch the trains and the people. Another contributor complains that the floorboards creak. Of course they creak, it's an old hotel! Lighten up. James Joyce mentions the hotel in one of his masterpieces. It is full of history.
I to, was up-graded (they seem to do that a lot) and ended up in a splendid room, with a massive bed, with the most comfortable mattress ever. They are obviously working through the hotel, floor by floor, refurbishing the rooms to a high standard and the top floor rooms are very comfortable and decorated to a high standard.
Brilliant location, another reason I always stay at the NS. You can also hear traditional Irish live music less than five minutes away at O'Shea's, so you don't need to trail to Temple Bar for that.",5,2013,04,30
219,Very enjoyable!,Spent 2 nights here. Found it Clean and attractively  furnished.The Staff were friendly and helpful. There was a  Good choice at breakfast and the evening menu in the cookhouse was lovely Easy walking distance to the various attractions.Very pleased with our choice.,5,2013,04,29
219,"Fantastic, lovely place.","Stayed here for 3 nights and could not of asked for any better. The room was great, staff was helpful and kind, everything you could want from a city hotel stay. Not far from any main tourest hot spots and shops.
Would 100% go back there next time. :) ",5,2013,04,28
219,4 Star!!!!...maybe in a parallel universe...,"This place advertises as a 4 Star online which is definitely not the case! It's a decent 2 star at best. Walking on the floorboards in this place makes you fell like your in an attic. The female receptionist at checkout was an absolute joke. but I must say the guy who checked me in was very helpful, The cleanliness wasn't the greatest and the mattress mush have been there since Dev was a corporal in the FCA! It was minging! Honestly! Avoid if you can afford it!",2,2013,04,25
219,A Very Pleasant Surprise.,"My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights last weekend and I must say that I was very happy that I chose this hotel. I normally stay at Wynn's Hotel when I visit Dublin but as it was fully booked I had to choose another hotel for this trip and I'm really glad that I picked The North Star. It is so close to Connolly Station , Busaras , The Luas  and only a 5 minute walk to O'Connell Street.
 On arrival we were greeted by a very pleasant receptionist, Ignacio. I had requested a smoking room but he told me that there wasn't any available but he could see that I was very disappointed and made a quick phone call and got me an upgrade to a superior room where I could smoke.... needless to say, I was thrilled. The room was lovely and very comfortable, in fact the whole hotel was beautifully decorated.
 The breakfast was great, a wonderful variety. All the staff were so friendly and welcoming, especially Ignacio and Vera. 
All in all a very nice hotel, very comfortable with extremely pleasant staff and close to all amenities. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,04,24
219,Good Location,My husband & I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights & we really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is very well located next to the train station & is only a few minutes walk from O'Connell street. The staff were lovely and the bar was really nice. The breakfast which was included in our deal was excellent. Unfortunately we did not eat evening meals in the hotel but the menu looked great. Would definently stay in this hotel again - great value for money.,4,2013,04,24
219,could try harder,"An enjoyable few days in Dublin. The hotel is fine. It has a great location just beside connoll station and  mins to busaras and mins to oconnell street. We stayed in a premium room and it was nice and modern with a small balcony.  Rooms were clean, however small touches could make this average hotel great, Things like biscuits with the tea/coffee, different choices of tea/coffee,shampoo in the bathroom, better air con. Breakfast was Ok but addition of some more fruit and pastries would make it great. Doors etc could do with a lick of paint and concierge area didnt have much on display to promote Dublin. It seems like Im just nitpicking but its makes me a bit cross that small things could make and average hotel great!",3,2013,04,23
219,Great Hotel!  No Free Wifi...,"I wish to have given this hotel a better rating as it was a beautiful hotel, great location, and had friendly staff but it had 2 drawbacks for me. One was the price of the internet - and then once we bought it it was painfully slow to the point that we had paid for our entire stay in internet and did not even end up using it. Second was that we also ordered room service on our last night and it was way overpriced and was barely edible. I would much more recommend the pizza place right around the corner of the hotel which has a 5 euro special and has great pizza. The hotel itself is in a fairly good location to walk around and see everything in Dublin.",3,2013,04,21
219,Fantastic stay!,"We booked our stay at the North Star Hotel through a Groupon deal and booked an extra night as we had stayed before and are very fond of the hotel.  It is in a good location as it is just opposite Connolly station and about a 5-10 minute walk from O'Connell Street.  From the moment we stepped through the door we were made to feel very welcome with a surprise complimentary upgrade to the Oscar Wilde Suite!  We were able to check in an hour early as our room was ready.  The room was gorgeous - plenty of space and very clean.  The bar has been renovated since our last visit and they've done a great job with it - there is a lovely atmosphere.  We ate in the bar on our first night and really enjoyed our meal.  Breakfast was great on both mornings with a good selection of hot food as well as cereals, fruit etc.  It certainly set us up for the day!  We really enjoyed our stay at the North Star.  We could find fault with it at all.  The staff is a real credit to the hotel as every staff member, no matter what their position, greeted us with a smile and a hello.  We will definitely be back and would certainly recommend.  Thank you for a lovely break.",5,2013,04,21
219,"Lovely staff, lovely hotel","Stayed for two nights at this hotel on a deal. All general areas and most of the rooms have been updated and have been tastefully done.
We had a premier room which was on the 6 th floor and was spotlessly clean, with a comfy bed, new pillows and a fridge. A small stand on only balcony was pleasant. Air con worked and was simple to operate. 
The use of the premier lounge was a bonus with complimentary bottled water, biscuits and a coffee machine with lovely coffee. The only problem was that even though our room keys were validated to give us entry to this lounge, on three separate occasions, they did not work. Nearby staff let us in but perhaps the process of validation needs looked at?

On our first night we ate in the restaurant and the starter was, quite simply, one of the nicest I have ever had..goats cheese, beetroot, pear and caramelised pecan nuts..delicious. The main course was also good but I had the feather blade steak which comes cooked medium rare, ( exactly as I would order it) and this, unfortunately was tough and in edible in parts. Dessert was also excellent. And cocktails were most enjoyable too.

The staff make this hotel and every one was friendly, attentive and helped us enjoy our stay.
From Damien the manager, to the restaurant staff, ( Chris, Bruno and John ) Ignacio and all the girls on reception, Vera the housekeeper and all the cleaning staff, to Conor the carpenter! All pleasant without exception and a credit to the management. 

Breakfast was plentiful, hot and speedily served by, again, helpful and pleasant staff. 
The hotel on the first night was extremely quiet and the trains aren't an issue as double glazing and ear plugs keep sound out. ( I take ear plugs to any city hotel stay) 

Our second night we had interrupted sleep from a drunk in the next room, who stood on his balcony in a state of undress and screamed at the top of his voice. We rang the night porter and this guest was dealt with quickly and efficiently. There had been a darts competition on at the O2 and unfortunately a small number of attendees had caused trouble and noise through out the North Star and other hotels. Our hotel dealt speedily with this, called the Guards and had the major troublemakers evicted. It was good they have this policy as many other hotels don't take a stand against this type of behaviour. This type of guest is NOT reflective of the majority of guests staying at this hotel and the North Star cannot be held responsible for these individuals. We met some lovely people and enjoyed late night drinks and chats in the upstairs lounge and this helped make our stay memorable.

 We enjoyed our late 2.30 pm check out and the handiness of Connolly Street station for our return train back to Belfast. ( one suggestion might be that there is some way of telling housekeeping staff that certain clients have a late check out, notice to hang on door perhaps? ) Due to lack of sleep the previous night we stayed in on our last morning and tried to relax and sleep, but the cleaning staff came in on 3 occasions to check the room. Just a small point but it would have been appreciated.
Just a shame that a middle aged Irishman spoiled our second night but I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and plan to stay again. 
All in all a cosy friendly hotel with great staff, good food and handy for trains and Dart connections with a ten minute stroll to O'Connell street, and a wonderful Thai restaurant one minute away!",4,2013,04,20
219,Great hotel,I stayed here last weekend. I was in Dublin for the pink concert. We went on the shuttle to the concert and returned by the same was excellent service. The concierge was very helpful.  We checked in at 10.30 and got into our room right away. I paid to stay In premier club suites and it didn't disappoint. Room was lovely airy clean. We had a fridge and had use of the premier lounge was great. Breakfast was excellent and plenty of choice. Would recommend this hotel.,5,2013,04,19
219,Good spot to see dublin,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the North Star Hotel Dublin. You enter into a period building that although run down at present is undergoing a full restoration, you then pass under the railway line and into a new multi floored modern hotel. The joy of the place is Its old and classic, but not the part where you have to stay, the view over the Dublin rooftops and the railway line are very charming.
The top floor residence lounge has great views, we ate in there on a takeaway that the reception staff ordered for us as it was to late for the kitchen.
The rooms are very well laid out , the bed was huge and very comfortable. Breakfast was self service It lacked any personal touch but there was plenty of it and wasted non of our precious time.
We would recommend this hotel, its a quality stay in a good position.",4,2013,04,17
219,!,"I don't care what anyone says, the north star hotel was absolutely fantastic. I went the time of the Justin Bieber concert with my best friends, and once we walked in the friendly atmosphere was brilliant! They treated us like they knew us and helped us out a lot. Our rooms were brilliant! Looked 5 star! We had tea/coffee and a kettle in the room. We were right at the heart of Dublin. If we were stuck they gave us directions to the places we wanted to visit. Everything was great! I do agree with one of the rooms you could hear the trains, but realistically the trains stop at about 8 or 9 o'clock at night and don't start to 7 or 8 the next morning so it was not that big of a deal. Just book a room which isn't the train side if your that fussy. Other than that, I myself am going back to this wonderful hotel in June again, its the only hotel I wanted. Absolutely amazing!",5,2013,04,14
219,"Ok stay, quality of rooms varies incredibly across the hotel, a lottery to which type you book!","We booked our room through the secret hotel rooms option on last minute.com and from the description we were really looking forward to our stay. On arrival we were slightly less excited, sold to us as a newly refurbished hotel, although this was clearly the case inside, the exterior of the property still requires some attention particularly to the peeling paint! Also, this hotel was sold to us as four star, but the grading on the outside of the hotel was still 3 star as was the displayed Irish tourist board rating.

On entering the hotel, we were far more impressed and it was clear where the attention had been given when the hotel was refurbished. The lobby was in a very attractive and grand style with lots of comfortable but elegant chairs, mirrors and chandeliers. There is also a gym and sauna available to guests although we did not use them as it was a relatively short stay.

We checked in with our room allocated to us as it was ready before the stated check in time. I had previously contacted the hotel as our short break in Dublin was for a surprise celebration - to celebrate my husband's 30 th birthday and was pleased when they said they would ensure we were given a nice room. Unfortunately on arriving at our room on the first floor, it was far below our expectations. 

The room itself was nicely decorated, although the bathroom was clearly old and did not seem like it had been included in the refurbishment.  With the rooms proximity to the lifts, we could hear the announcement very clearly every time it arrived to deposit or collect other guests from the floor and right outside the window was a ventilation shaft which at frequent intervals let off noisy whirring sounds. The outlook was also not very good, looking directly through bars onto an adjacent office building. 

So we requested to be moved, this was not the special 4* star experience we had expected. So for an extra charge of 30 euro per night we asked to be upgraded. We were then given a room on the 7th floor which was much more like other 4* hotel rooms we have stayed in in the past. The room was light and airy with a king sized and very comfortable bed. The room had a small balcony overlooking Croke Park and you could also see the Spire from the balcony. Additions such as free water, biscuits and additional tea and coffee were also a bonus in the premier suite lounge. Clearly there is a great difference between the quality of the rooms across the hotel, it is a lottery to which type of room you will receive almost like it is two hotels.

The additional charge to be upgraded was subsequently removed when I made them aware of my previous contact via email with the hotel and the promise that had been made to me, and although this made up for some of our disappointment it didn't leave a very positive impression of the hotel overall. But it's such a shame as it means that when we visit Dublin again we will be looking for alternative accommodation but will not be recommending our friends and family to stay here.",3,2013,04,13
219,Friendly staff. Rooms newly decorated.,"Stayed here with my 12 year old daughter in March 2013. Connolly train station is a 2 minute walk. The luas is also 2 mins away. Dublin city center is about a 15 / 20 minute walk. The hotel staff were very friendly & helpful. Check in was fast. Bar food was delicious & very tasty. Rooms, while small have been recently decorate. There was a Q at breakfast but staff handled this very well & everyone was seated with not too long a wait. The Hotel run a return bus to events near by ...ie. The O2, @ a cost of ‚Ç¨7.50 pp. I will come back & stay at this Hotel again.",4,2013,04,10
219,Great place to stay in Dublin,"This is a great place to stay in Dublin, just across the road from the main railway station and a short walk from all city centre attractions. Very comfortable and well-equipped rooms. Be aware there's some noise from the very close railway line if your room is at the back of the hotel, but we were too tired to be worried by it!",5,2013,04,08
219,Lovely stay,"I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights with a friend of mine this March and I cannot find another word to describe our stay, except amazing! People at the reception and at the bar were always very helpful, giving us tips of where best to go and how to go there! All were very friendly making sure that we feel mostly welcomed and at home! Food there was pretty amazing too! Rooms were also always clean! In my opinion, it is also located in a good area too, even though some locals did not agree! But we never found any problems, it's within walking distance from most of Dublin's touristic locations, and there's the O'Connelly station just across the street!

I am recommending this hotel to my Maltese friends, and will definitely visit again myself, hopefully in the near future :)",5,2013,04,08
219,Great value!,"I have just got back from a three day stay at the north star hotel with my partner. The check in was very proffesional and we was given a free upgrade- extremely nice gesture of the hotel! The room was immaculate, really big beds, spotless bathroom, large tv on the wall, free to use safe, tea and coffee constantly replaced! It was in an ok location- about a fifteen minute walk to the temple bar area! If you want something bang in the centre, then maybe this hotel isn't for you! But we didn't mind the walk! The staff was lovely, so helpful! If i return to Dublin again, then I would definitly consider going back to this hotel!",4,2013,04,07
219,Easy location,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of March 2013.
Upon check-in, the staff is VERY helpful, kind and professional.  We stayed in a premier suite on the 7th floor and was happy with our room.  Minor interior details were noticeable by both of us...such as, the carpet and sliding door not meeting (cement was noticeable), the toilet paper handle was broke and lastly the telephone ringer DID NOT ring which was only noticed when our wakeup calls never came through.  I suggest always checking the phone once you check-in to make sure the phone works.....at ANY hotel worldwide. : )
The bartenders at the hotel bar were friendly and helpful to the tourist.  FREE wifi in the hotel bar when you purchase a drink....GUINESS baby....
The hotel is located in from what locals say ""not the best"" area but we NEVER found that to be a problem.  Oconnelly station train is located directly across the street which we took to HOWTH for fresh seafood on the water.  A must!
Please stay away for the Chinese restaurant (hole in the wall) located a few feet away on Amiens Street.  It is called, WOK on INN.  They OVER USE MSG and made us all ill for about 6 hours.  
For the most part, the hotel is pleasant for your stay while visiting Dublin.",4,2013,04,05
219,4th time staying and could never fault it,"This was our 4th time staying in the North Star Hotel.  

We live in 3 hours from Dublin so our only option if we want to go to anything that is on in Dublin (eg Concerts) is to stay up there and we are delighted to have found the North Star.  

It is in an ideal location within walking distance of the O2, Croke Park and O'Connell Street.  Connolly Rail and Luas station are directly across the road with Busars just around the corner.  We usually get the bus to the Red Cow Luas and get the Luas straight into Connolly which as I said was across the road.

The rooms are always clean and even though we have only ever stayed 2 nights they have always been cleaned mid stay.

We have not had breakfast at the hotel but have had lunch and dinner both of which have been excellent.

The staff have always been very helpful and friendly.

I have and will always recommend the North Star to all my family and friends",5,2013,04,04
219,Irish-Navy Game,We stayed here for the Notre Dame/Navy game.  Great breakfast included with the stay.  Rooms were clean and beds were very comfortable.  Lots of local places to shop and plenty of little joints to eat at.  I had a great meal around the corner at a Shish Kabab place and had a nice conversation with both patrons and employees.  The North Star Hotel has a great bar and quite the array of beer and liquor.,4,2013,04,03
219,Wonderful experience,"Just returned from a two night Easter break at the North Star and I cannot recommend this hotel enough.

From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out we couldnt find fault with this hotel. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, a real credit to the hotel. Rooms have been recently refurbished and are beautiful, and more importantly they are spotless!  Could hear the trains on occasion but this was not intrusive and as we were out during the day this was never an issue.  

Breakfast was very nice, plenty available and all hot and well prepared. The hotels bar is also very nice and reasonably priced.

Hotel is in a great location and is only a ten minute walk to the centre. 

If you are looking for a clean, welcoming and central hotel this is the place for  you! ",5,2013,04,01
219,birthday wk/end,"this 3*hotel should be 4*plus it was very clean moden staff was very helpfull, the only down fall was the dishes  at breakfast was not  removed very quick, but a great stay anyway,and would go back there.",5,2013,03,29
219,Lovely room,Me and a friend stayed here for 3 nights over St Patrick's weekend and had a lovely stay. We were on the 6th floor in the premier suites. Great clean room and fantastic breakfast in the morning. Close to town centre as well!,4,2013,03,26
219,St.Patricks day stay,"Stayed here for st.patricks day with a friend & it was very nice. Hotel has just recieved a refurbishment and is nicely done. Room was clean & adequete. Beds were comfy and clean. The breakfast was great, buffet style. Food like sandwiches & pizza is served upto 3am and service is very good. My only complain was that there was not enough towels in the bathroom. One per person was simply not enough. Also the bath products were very scarce. A note on the area: This part of Dublin is a little bit rough so i would suggest getting a taxi after a night out & not walking alone. Other than that, a fine hotel.",4,2013,03,18
219,"Lovely hotel, clean rooms.","Stayed at The North Star Hotel in March. Had a room on the 5th floor, which was very clean, modern & super comfy bed. Only minor complaint was breakfast, both days the hot breakfast was only warm and despite asking twice for a pot of coffee, still didn't get any.",4,2013,03,17
219,"Very convenient central location, close to key transport links, shopping and entertainment.","I stayed in the North Star two nights in March 2013. It was very easy to reach by public transport from the airport. The airport bus stopped within sight of the hotel and the main rail station is less than a minute away and the Luas tram too. So excellent for transport connections. Shopping on O'Connell Street etc is minutes away, walking, or by tram, if your lazy.
Received a good welcome from the attentive reception staff and a warm smile from the ever helpful Maria. She did much to make my stay pleasant and smooth.
The bed room was very spacious, clean and fresh smelling after the recent refurbishment. Bathroom too well equipped. Tea coffee facilities available in the room. TV and hair dryer.
Breakfast was very comprehensive, really the full Irish. Loved the coffee and soda bread too.Would really recommend this hotel. Next time I am in Dublin I will .stay there again",4,2013,03,16
219,"Good location, clean rooms","I stayed for 2 nights in february.  Good location, 2 luas stops within sight and the train station directly across the street.  The rooms were basic but clean, reminded me of a Premier Quality Inn.  No phone in the room, but didn't need it anyway.

Service on the desk was excellent.  Same staff always seemed to be there.  Late checkout was not a problem.  I would stay again.",4,2013,03,15
219,Lovely clean hotel,"I stayed here with my bf in feb 2013 and had a lovely stay. The hotel is a short walk into the main city centre of dublin and also has a supermarket near by. We ate at the hotel and found the food to be quite delicious. The staff were also really friendly and helped order a cab for us. The room was really spacious, we had a double bed and a single, and also a bath and a shower. We really liked this hotel because it was clean and comfortable. I would recommend if you are visiting dublin :)",5,2013,03,15
219,Excellent hotel and staff,"My wife and I stayed at The North Star for 2 nights in March 2013. The hotel rooms are being refurbished and we were more than pleased with our room which had a lovely bathroom with bath and shower,and was spotlessly clean.
Our room was at the back of the hotel and was nice and quiet. We also stayed the following week on our return to Dublin and were given a room at the front of the hotel, facing  the main road and close to the railway station.
There was a little bit of noise but nothing that stopped my wife and I sleeping. Again this was a refurbished room and was excellent value.

We had breakfast on two mornings , and could find no fault. It was the usual buffet style, but with plenty of choice and efficient staff.

The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from Temple Bar area and slightly less to O'Connell Street.

On our second visit there was a problem with our reservation, our fault, not the hotel's.
The staff could not have been more helpful and Linda from reservations , and Damien from management were excellent and helped us to resolve the problem.

Car parking is available on site for 8 euros a day which is really good.

Will definitely return next time we are in Dublin.",4,2013,03,13
219,Extremely disappointed,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of March for a special treat unfortunately it did not turn out a treat.  We booked this hotel as it was near the Bus Station and was informed by management that although we would be arriving before 2 o'clock (check-in time) we would have a room. That was not so as when we arrived  we were informed by the receptionist our room would not be ready before 2 o'clock.
Our room was 208 just beside the railway line, noisy yes but nothing compared to the noise coming from the air-conditioning connected to the room below us. This was not as bad the first night as the second night - it was so noisy we only got  3 hours sleep.
We had to go and get towels for our room both days. The second day while having a shower the water went off.  The breakfast was cold we had to ask to have it heated up.
Our booking included an evening meal which we were given a voucher for.  We gave this to the waitress in the restaurant and was informed this voucher only covered 15 euros each.  This would have hardly covered the price of the main course.
We have already been in touch with management and have been informed that they will be making changes to the restaurant regarding the evening meal.  Unfortunately they had to learn their mistakes at our expense.  We would never stay here again.",1,2013,03,12
219,Great hotel,Just had a fantastic overnight stay for my husbands birthday we stayed in a premier suite absolutely beautiful the only thing I could find to moan about was no shower cap :( place was spotless staff were really helpful and courteous and breakfast was great.  The hotel bar was lovely too courtesy drinks gratefully enjoyed love this hotel have stayed before and would stay again in a heartbeat really handy for icon bell st and a bit of shopping and a 2 min walk back to the train and home ,5,2013,03,10
219,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff",Stayed here for one night. Had some problems with socket not wrking in our room. After informing reception we were moved immediately to a bigger room by a lovely member of staff who couldnt have been more helpful/apolagetic. Breakfast was lovely and service was great. Great hotel with lovely staff would highly recommend.,5,2013,03,08
219,Exactly What I Wanted,"This hotel was everything I needed for my 5 night stay in Dublin. I was very happy to see that the hotel was completely spotless. It could be a bit noisy at times but that didn't bother me. The only negative was that the continental breakfast wasn't exactly amazing, but there are plenty of better (and cheaper) alternatives in the area. Also, it was a little tricky to get the shower temperature just right. 

On the other hand, the location was PERFECT. You could walk to absolutely any part of the city in under 20 minutes. Which was great because you don't have to spent a cent on taxis if you don't want to. Connolly Station is right across the street, making it extremely easy to use the LUAS and Dart to get around cheaply. 

I've read some reviews saying the neighborhood wasn't safe and this couldn't be further from the truth. I'm a 5'4"", 105lbs, gay, American who was in Dublin alone and I felt completely safe the entire time. Don't believe the north side's bad reputation.",5,2013,03,05
219,Brilliant,We Absolutely loved this hotel stayed in December they were having a refurb and must say it was looking fab will definetly be back .staff are very friendly go out of their way to help you. It's close to the train station and a short walk from the main streets and shops.didnt hear any trains or noise in the room we were in,4,2013,03,04
219,Excellent,"Just back from a 1 night stay @ the North Star Hotel with my boyfriend.We were up for the Script concert and booked this hotel as part of Living Social voucher which was a fantastic deal. The hotel is lovely and really clean and the staff are exceptionally friendly. Nothing was to much hassel for them and check in was quick. Finding the hotel was really easy we got the luas to the Connolly stop and it was literally across the road from here. Location was fab near everything we needed 10 mins walk to O' Connell Street and 10-15mins to the 02. 
We stayed in a Premier king room (was part of the deal) which I would reccomend to pay the extra few euros for. This room  was located on the 7th floor (758) no noise, nice and spacious with comfortable beds n fantastic shower. The best thing about the Living Social deal was the late check out (2.30pm) which myself and my boyfriend were very thankful for after a late night it was so nice after breakfast to come back to your room and relax and have a  shower with no rushing to check out. 
Overall i would highly recommend this hotel and will be back again soon. :-)",5,2013,03,04
219,North star 3 night stay,"Very good, clean and comfortable room.
Requested early check in, was upgraded to executive room, but both rooms we were given were noisey due to the trains and music but we were informed of this at the time of the upgrade which was ok.
Staff were pleasant. Rooms were very warm, cleaned every day. Breakfast was great. 
Good value for money, short walk to Temple bar and other attractions.",4,2013,03,03
219,Great hotel,"This hotel is a really clean hotel with friendly staff and easy access to anywhere in dublin. The tram station is literally across the road and is cheaper than any uk bus. 

The hotel is reasonably priced for rooms as well as drinks. The only thing that was a let down for me was the train line noise just outside the hotel. 

Overall a fun and friendly environment.
",5,2013,03,03
219,Pleasantly impressed by this much improved hotel!,"We needed a hotel close to the train station as we had an early train next morning so the North Star had been booked initially with proximity to the train station being the over-riding criteria . We didn't expect much from this 3 star but our expectations were exceeded by pleasant staff, a high spec newly refurb ed room and a great breakfast.",4,2013,02,25
219,"Value, convenience, friendliness.","Title really says most of it.  We were a group of friends and could find no fault with this hotel. We were in rooms probably due for refurbishment,and at the low price we paid we were still well pleased. The rooms were clean, warm and comfortable. DART station opposite and the bus station a 3 minute walk.",4,2013,02,25
219,Great hotel if up for a concert,"This hotel was great. We stayed there the night we went to a concert in the O2 and it was great value, particularly with a special offer from a deals website. We were in a Premier room with the most comfortable bed I've slept in for a long time. However, some noise from the Dart could be heard in the morning. Breakfast was good. Despite te noise, I really enjoyed my stay and will be back :)",4,2013,02,24
219,great place to stay,just back from staying 5 nights in North Star hotel.  Had a lovely break in Dublin - plenty to see and do and this hotel is a great central base.  Not far to walk to Temple Bar area and all major sites.  Near to train station and bus station for easy links to other places. We caught coach to Cork three hours each way then caught local bus in Cork to visit Blarney Castle.  Would recommend hotel.  Kieran the concierge is a great character and very helpful. Didnt eat in hotel as so many other places to try but we did have drinks there and not expensive.  Get hotel shuttle bus to and from airport for only 5 euros per person.,4,2013,02,22
219,Ok hotel with lovely staff and a big breakfast,If your looking for something close to the city and you don't mind an oldish type hotel then this it. The room was fab albeit you could hear the dart and there was a bit of a weird smell. The breakfast was a big fry which was excellent when going to a match and/or recover from a night out,3,2013,02,21
219,Great place for sightseeing in Dublin,"Had a wonderful weekend in Dublin and staying at the North Star was a great choice. Not far from Temple Bar and we even managed a leisurely stroll to the Guinness Storehouse from here quite easily. The hotel was very clean, breakfast was fabulous and the newly opened bar was beautiful. The bed was extremely comfortable and the upgrade to a suite was an unexpected surprise. Although the train station is across the road and there are trains running regularly we did not really notice them. We used the Paddy Wagon tour bus to the airport which was very efficient.
Would stay here again as it was good value for money. There is obvious refurbishment going on at the hotel at the moment and what has been completed up to now does do the hotel justice. Keep up all the good work!",4,2013,02,17
219,Staff Very Friendly but Hotel badly in need of improvement,"I found the reception staff lovely and was greeted with smiles.  After requesting a quiet room, I was given Room 350 which I was pleasantly surprised was at the very end of a corridor away from noise.  Unfortunately I did not get any sleep due to the noise outside, the window was not sound proof, and I could even hear a lady walking by in high heels. I was extremely disappointed and extremely tired the next day! Beware and take your own hairdryer as I can honestly say it is the worst hairdresser I ever had to use in any hotel, I left with a very tired head and messy hair as was unable to dry it properly with the low heat... I ate in the residents lounge as they were doing renovations to the main bar, food was very average and lacked any variety for vegetarians. Though I have to mention the bar man was lovely and very hospitable. Would not stay here again due to being unable to get any sleep with the noise outside.",2,2013,02,06
219,"Amazing room for great price, and very friendly staff.","Stayed for one night and was very impressed. Doesn't look great from the outside but the inside is lovely, really surprised at how big the room was, all very clean and really comfy bed and modern bathroom. The staff are very friendly as helpful and the restaurant is quite good. The bar isn't great as it's a bit make-shift. The area is very handy for the central train and bus stations and fine for walking to the shopping area during the day although it's not a great area for walking around at night as it's a bit rough, and too long a walk to the pubs and clubs for girls wearing heels!",4,2013,02,05
219,Perfect for City Break,"Stayed here for 1 night on a study visit to Dublin with a group. Perfect location for excessing the city, rooms were spacious, clean and modern. 
Our group had dinner there which was exceptional, breakfast was also good. The best attribute of this hotel are the staff, every member was extremely helpful and brought a professional touch to every aspect of our stay.",4,2013,02,03
219,Sightseeing with friends,"It was pleasant to stay in this hotel. Everybpody was friendly and ready to help.
The breakfast was good and sufficient. The rooms (for 4 persons) are simple.
I will be stay again anytime. Thank you for all
      
      ",4,2013,01,30
219,Fantastic Room,"We stayed here for one night! The room was large and spotless, the bed the comfiest I have ever slept in. From the outside it does not do itself justice, because once inside its comfort all the way. Breakfast was of a very high standard with a selection of fruit, nine cereals and a very good hot buffet!
Only negitive was the bar is closed for renovations, when we arrived the residents lounge was open but later in the evening this was closed and the option was to have a drink in a dingy room down stairs, we declined!",5,2013,01,30
219,Great weekend.. Minus the fire alarm at 2am!,"We stayed at the North Star for two nights 19th & 20th Jan for my 22nd Birthday, it was our first time to Dublin & first impressions were great, location fab just far enough down from O'Connell street to be away from noise. Bus service to and from the airport easy, cheap and reliable.
We had a premier club room on the 7th floor with a balcony (which we later found not so great as the people in the room next door to us were out smoking, shouting, dancing on it at 3am which woke us up on the first night)..however the room was beautiful, the bed was so comfy and the shower was amazing!
The hotel itself is decorated lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful with loads of information on what to do and see, we didn't catch the gentlemans name that helped fill us in on the best way to get around and what there is to see but he is a real asset to the hotel.
We had room service on the first night, it was very quick and the food was beautiful highly recommend the stone baked pizza!
Unfortunately the only thing that slightly ruined our stay was on the second night at 2.30am the fire alarms went off because someone intelligent was smoking in their non smoking room, we understand this isn't really the hotels fault but it did ruin a lovely stay and lovely nights sleep as by the time it stopped we couldn't go back to sleep as we had to get up at 3.30am to get ready to go the airport, the staff on reception were very apologetic & we understand it was just one of those things (hope the idiot smoking in his room was fined in some way for waking everyone up I expect the hotel did a lot of apologising to guests for his error).
Other than that Loved dublin will be back soon!!",4,2013,01,22
219,great value for money.,cheap and cheerful.. very clean...only downfall was the member of housekeeping who walked into our room at half eight in the morning.lol.. we stayed here for a concert in the o2... there was an organised return shuttle bus from the hotel.for 7.50 but we walked it in 20 mins happily enough. very comfortable clean rooms lovely showers great location. went for brekky next morning around the corner in a BONZA PIES. got pancakes. yum.,3,2013,01,15
219,A very enjoyable stay,"We stayed at the North Star Hotel over Easter weekend last year and really enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean and our room was a decent size. The only downside to our stay was that a train line ran directly behind our room and the early morning trains were a bit of a problem on the Saturday morning, but not so much on the Sunday morning. This would not be the case in all areas of the hotel and had we stayed in a different room I think that we would have given a rating of 5!  We ate in the restaurant on our first night and had an enjoyable meal, although the selection was a little limited - we put this down to it being Good Friday though! I believe there is a normally wider range of choices available.  The breakfasts were super - a good selection of hot and cold food, all of which was very fresh and tasty. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. It is a very central and convenient location, both for arriving by train and for getting around the city. Overall, a very pleasant stay.",4,2013,01,13
219,Perfect location and great value,"This hotel was exactly what u new at a great price. The location is great and the luas is right across the road . The rooms were clean and had everything we needed . The food was good in the restaurant just one slight complaint the burger was over done , the stir fry on the other hand was very good. I would definitely return to this hotel again :) ",4,2013,01,13
219,"Very good Hotel, really a hidden gem in Dublin.","Having just returned with my Wife from our 3rd break in this Hotel, We both agree that it's even better now than before. There have been major renovation work throughout, still not completed, but soon will be.  The room we had was a standard room, it was excellent, plenty of room, very clean and comfortable, the only thing we missed was a digital clock radio. We had a TV and of course tea/ coffee making facilities with plenty of supplies left each morning.  Good shower and bath all very clean too. No complaints re the breakfast, good choice of cereal etc. We chose the porridge every morning, it was excellent. Then the full Irish Breakfast served HOT and very appetising, no cold eggs, sausages, bacon here. All the staff are lovely, very friendly and helfpful, right from the Manager to the cleaners. We would definitely return and highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2013,01,11
219,"Lovely Hotel, with fantastic breakfast","We stayed here for 2 nights. We managed to see everything we wanted to thanks to the hotel staff that told us the best ways of getting around Dublin, also the staff were very helpful at saying how we could save money and time getting to and from the various places. In the three days that we were in Dublin we managed to see the Guinness factory, Jameson Whiskey Distillery, Wax works, Dublina, river dance show, Killmanham Prison, Red bus tour and lastly Oliver! the musical. I think without the amazing staff and fantastic transport in Dublin this would not have been possible. 
The breakfast was fantastic, lots of choice. We all said it set us up for the long days of sight seeing!! The rooms were lovely and the cleaners were brilliant. Would definately consider staying here again when in Dublin.",5,2013,01,11
219,Vibe for Philo Time,"Just wanted to say a MASSIVE thank you to the bar staff at the North Star....Paddy, Shawn, Keith, John and the new fella (Paul I think his name is!). Each and every year we descend on the hotel and pretty much take it over. Each and every year we are greeted by the warmest of welcomes by the staff who have, after all these years become an integral part of Vibe time. The work soooo hard for us, are extremely patient and work till they barely stand. These guys sure do know how to keep thier customers happy. Both they, and we, know what to expect around the 4th Jan and to be honest, we look forward to seeing the guys almost as much as seeing the band! These guys have become like friends to us regulars over the years and I for one, am truly grateful for thier proffessional attitude and cheary demeanor! Till the next one guys....have a great year! Much love, Lucy xxx",5,2013,01,08
219,Vibe for Philo,"Just want to thank the wonderful and patient bar staff, Keith, Shawn, John, Paddy and new boy Paul for their wonderful bar-tending skills (into the wee small hours) right through the four/five long days of the Vibe For Philo, also a big thank you to all the hotel/reception staff who look after the Vibers on a yearly basis - as you all know, you've become the Vibe HQ over the past few years, and we all look forward to seeing you every January - thanks guys, for everything!!!",5,2013,01,07
219,Vibe Time !,"I've stayed may times here in the North Star , and always found it spotless and the staff excellent . So this year I decided to stay for the Annual Vibe For Philo weekend and enjoy the company of fellow Thin Lizzy fans from the world over. Now this is one of the most hectic for all the staff here as its booked for months in advance. But even though the hotel was at its busiest ,Every one of the staff were  brilliant , and nothing was too much trouble , Chris and Vitta and all in Reception were great and all of the bar staff, worked every hour could give them . They made the whole weekend all the more enjoyable with their good spirits and excellent attention. I could recommend the North Star to anyone as its now a home from home. and brilliantly located. Thank you.  see you all soon , Myles Lally.",5,2013,01,07
219,Great location,"The North Star Hotel is situated across the road from Connelly train station and within easy walking distance of O'Connel Street so it is close to shops, restaurants and pubs.  It has recently been redecorated and looks great.  Our room was spacious, clean and nicely appointed.  The staff on reception were helpful and efficient.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2013,01,04
219,Great location,"Great location, across road from train station which was so convenient, few minutes walk away from O'Connell Street. Room was really clean, spacious, big bright bathroom, lovely decor.  Breakfast was great. Would stay here again, think we were in older part of hotel with no lift, but only on second floor, staff were friendly and helpful, would recommend this hotel. Room very warm.",4,2012,12,30
219,"Nice hotel, very good location!!","Overall, North Star's best features are its great location (just across the street from Connelly Station) and the friendly staff.  Room looked like pictures displayed (traditional/standard) and clean, but finishes could look tired earlier than they should, (due to quality of workmanship).  the double bed was small, however, there was an extra single bed in the room as well. Shower was hot and consistent but a high side and screen placement impedes accessibility.  Value for money was reasonable and would likely stay again when next time in Dublin.",3,2012,12,17
219,Best hotel I've stayed in :),"My partner and I stayed at the North Star hotel in September 2010. We are planning another trip to Dublin, so I thought I'd see what the current reviews of the North Star are like. 

All I can say is, you could put some people in Buckingham palace and they would still find something to moan about! 

From the moment my partner and I walked into the hotel, we felt welcomed and were very impressed with the inside appearance if the hotel. Don't be deceived by the way it looks from the outside. Our room was one of the premier rooms and was spotless. Our bathroom was very modern and clean. We had a plasma tv on the wall and access to wifi if we wished to use it. 

Clearly, the people doing all the moaning are the ones who've been cheapskates and booked the standard rooms to save 20quid! From the sounds of it, these rooms are being renovated and I've no doubt they will be to the same fantastic standard that our room was. 

Honestly couldn't fault the hotel facilities or staff and certainly not the appearance or cleanliness! ",5,2012,12,16
219,christmas shopping hotel break,"Just back from this lovely hotel ,which is only a stones throw from O Connell Street i.e city center.Room was excellent very modern huge kingsize bed lovely fresh linen and very good nights sleep.bathroom very clean and tidy overall an excellent room on the 7th floor with a balcony and lovely night time view of the city with all its christmas lights.The breakfast was very nice and very well presented.Staff are wonderful and very helpful from reception to waiting and bar staff .Main train station is right opposite and bus station a few minutes walk.The hotel also supplies a shuttle bus to and from the airport.Overall a simply brilliant short break in a lovely city",4,2012,12,16
219,Absolutely excellent :-),"Arrived at hotel after booking a premium room to an upgrade to a suite. Suite was amazing as was the curtesy afforded us by the staff on reception, in the bar and the housekeeping. We were not rushed out the following morning, in fact we were granted the pleasure of leaving in our own time. I would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to family and friends. Thank you :-)  ",5,2012,12,15
219,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed for one night and found this hotel absolutely beautiful. My room was spotless and very modern looking. The bed was big and comfortable, had a great night sleep. No complaints about breakfast the next day and the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Would recommend this to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2012,12,12
219,Great spot,"Was in town on business a couple of weeks ago and stayed here. The staff were all friendly and courteous, very eager to help. The room and bathroom were both very clean and hospitable. The room had a balcony and a great view over the city from the seventh floor. The bed was top notch. The location is superb, within walking distance of most of the main attractions in the city centre, & major bus and rail stations just around the corner. The only drawback I could find was that they are in the middle of a renovation process at the moment, so some parts of the building are a little bit shabbier than others. The new areas look smart, but the old areas are a bit of a time warp. That aside I would not hesitate booking this place again.",5,2012,12,12
219,"Two night stay,totally enjoyable",Stayed 7th Dec with my sister and found the staff very helpful and extremely polite. Our room was lovely food excellent would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to people . Look forward to going back.,5,2012,12,10
219,"One night stay, no problems","Stayed here for one night as we were attending a concert in the city. Found the hotel had a strange entrance layout but the staff were helpful and we were upgraded to a premium suite for no extra cost which was nice.

The room was lovely, very well furnished and the air conditioning worked wonders. We had a balcony but there really isn't much of a view in the city centre. The bed was amazing, so comfortable we didn't want to leave!

I would recommend this as a one or two night stop off, I can't imagine spending any longer as although it was perfect for us it is quite cramped in the communal areas.

Great location too!",4,2012,12,08
219,Location Location,"Stay in the hotel for my wifes birthday in November 2012. We arrived late, but they had kept the restaurant open. Also surprised her with cake and sung ""Happy Birthday"". Had booked premier room, thought it would be away from the noise. Facilities in room good. However facing railway station. Train noise from 06.30 in morning until midnight. Did request move, and there was no problem, moved immediately. Some of the hotel is being refurbished, with noise and dust.
Did read the previous reviews, and this was mentioned, about location and noise. Location ideal for walking into city centre. However must be aware the area is not the most up market part of Dublin. However security at the hotel was very good, with mainly card access to all private parts of hotel.
Staff very friendly, smart dressed. Friendly bar staff, and reasonable bar prices. 
Had buffet breakfast, which had plenty of choice, and was not rushed out of restaurant. 
Arranged for transport to airport, cheap compared to taxi rate. Pre booked and arrived on time.
Would stay there again, and also recommend to firends and family.",4,2012,12,06
219,ok to stay for one night,"I personaly think the price of this Hotel is way over valued. The Room was ok, but not great. Bathroom I thought was ver shabby. All over I found that the Hotel was shabby and smelly. I wouldn't book this Hotel again.",3,2012,12,06
219,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"My break in Ireland was a gift from my partner so when we arrived at the hotel she was rather upset. The outside looked shabby and it was a rough looking area, about 15/20 minute walk to the centre. On the front door of the hotel there was a notice apologizing for its appearance as its being renovated. We walked in and up the stairs and was actually quite suprised, the staff were very friendly and were smartly dressed in their uniforms, the reception area was clean and big. Going to our room it had a double bed and a single bed, tv, coffee and tea facilities. Nice bathroom, clean towels. Only downside was that the sheets did not smell or seem very fresh. The bar was reasonably priced and everyone was very friendly. I hope they give the outside some TLC as well as the inside. I would return and recommend.",4,2012,12,04
219,Would not recommend this hotel,Stayed in this hotel for two nights in November. Would not recommend it to any one. Made a complaint to management on the morning I check out she said she would contact me on the Wednesday morning still waiting that was 3weeks ago,2,2012,12,04
219,very good,"Just returned from 2 nights at the northstar hotel and it was just perfect. A girlie week-end shopping and the location was great right beside connolly station and a 5-10 min walk to the shops ,The hotel was clean, warm, and had very friendly staff, Two of our party has coeliac and the hotel was able to cater for them both at breakfast and also in the resturant and the food was excellent, The rooms were clean with a flat screen tv, iron,hairdryer,tea /coffee,and safe,there was always warm waterand the towles were changed each day.I would stay here again without any question.",5,2012,12,03
219,Great city hotel,"Bear in mind that this a 3 star hotel. On arrival when we entered the hotel it was clear to see that the main entrance was being refurbished and not looking very good.That said we continued up the stairs to reception and founfd the staff to be very helpful.Our room wasn.t ready but that didn't really matter as we headed straight into the city centre shopping area of O'Connell street 10 minutes walk. we returned to the hotel late afternoon and when we got to our room we were really pleased a large room on the 4th floor with a double and two single beds which were really comfortable. Not much of a view looking towards the railway station but then not a bother to us after all we were on a city break not a costa week so why would you want a balcony only sleeping in the room anyway.It was very clean with tv and really efficient heating. We booked B and B and a good choice. Breakfast was the best and we have stayed in a lot of hotels.Good irish wholesome food best sausages ever!!
Cant fault his hotel if you want 5 star luxury then book 5 star if you want good value for money and good city centre location at reasonable price book North Star. we will definetly go back.",4,2012,12,01
219,Great for a quick stopover,"We were only passing through Dublin and looking for somewhere cheap and handy to stay. My mother recommended this-she often stays there when going to events. We found a really good deal online-¬£42 B&B but we were too early for breakfast the following morning.

What we saw of the hotel-between the entrance and our room was very nice. Clean, good decor, nice smelling etc. The staff were also very friendly and welcoming.

Our room was OK. A bit tired looking-especially the bathroom but it was clean and the water pressure was good. No wi-fi and very few tv channels.

We'd probably stay again if for a quick visit but would find somewhere a bit more luxurious for a proper weekend in the city.",4,2012,11,30
219,Fantastic!!!!,Had an amazing time in Dublin and this hotel made it extra special my 3 friends and I booked in for a family room but on arrival we were told we had been up graded to their 2 bedroom apartment which was really like home from home very modern ect and we got in our room straight away at 9am rather than have to wait till 2pm. The staff were amazing and friendly I will be staying again very soon 5 stars all the way for me and my friends x,5,2012,11,29
219,Very handy for an overnight stay near the O2,"Was up for a show at the O2 and booked here for the first time as it is on the Luas line between Heuston and the O2. Hadn't planned on hanging around the hotel or the area it is located in, so checked in at about 6.30pm on a Saturday night. They were busy but very friendly at reception and we had been upgraded so had a huge room with 2 doubles and a single bed on the 3rd floor. Nice and quiet although down at reception you could certainly hear trains - they hardly run all night though! Bathroom could do with a revamp but to be honest our trip was so short we didn't even use the shower in the morning so I am certainly not going to complain about it. Very surprised by an excellent breakfast buffet - really good choice and plenty of hot and cold options - we filled our boots! Would definitely recommend the price and location for any concerts or shows on this side of town and will certainly consider for a return trip. I also checked out the gym after breakfast but we were checking out for a midday train so didnt get a chance to use it - very well equipped though - pleasantly surprised.",3,2012,11,25
219,Terrible and Misleading,"I recently stayed at the North Star hotel with my partner for 2 nights for a concert. The room i had booked on the website showed a luxurious big comfortable room with a balcony. When we checked in, the room was NOTHING as shown to me on the website. it was small and there was no luxery about it! it was right next to a DART line which passed evey 5 minutes and was quite loud! we enquired into this misundering but all we were told was that the pictures on the website were of the priemier suites which turned out to be the dearest rooms they had. As if that wasnt bad enough the list goes on.....
Parking WAS NOT FREE as stated on a certain website. there was barely any room to park. we had to leave the car keys with the staff member which was very un necessary. and he was quite rude at times.
The Wifi only worked on my phone and not my laptop and only ONE of us was allowed access to the wifi.
When enquiring about places to go in dublin the staff members were clueless as none of them were Iirish.
The hotel pub had a terrble smell of stale sweat and was very run down. we actually had to walk away from this nightmare. On the second night the restaurant was closed and the were serving food in the bar. we requested for the menu several times as we were in a hurry to go to the concert. the menu was suppose to be out for 6pm and it wasnt given to us until 6.15pm.
On the morning of our departure, the lobby area was under construction. as i was walking down the stairs the builders kept hammering on the wall as i was passing which was thrown dust and debris in my face and it was all over the stairs. 

The only positive note i will mention is that the breakfast food and dinner food was nice and the bed was comfortable enough to sleep in and the room was clean enough.

Overall this was a very very disappointing trip, we will NEVER EVER stay in this hotel again. it claims to be a 4 star hotel but has 3 stars on their signs. it has the quality of a 2 star hotel, unless of course your staying in the premier suites, then you will be treated like kings and queens!!!",2,2012,11,25
219,Wifi,"Often stop here and it's very nice. Last time I looked at their website I saw they were offering free wifi which they didn't before. So looked around and found same room cheaper with Booking.com., so booked with them. On arrival at the hotel was informed that the free wifi only applies when you book with their more expensive website. Free wifi???.",4,2012,11,23
219,"Great Stay,J'avais un grand s√©jour","I had a great 13 night stay at The North Star. This was my second time travelling to Dublin with my 91 year old Mother. The food was great and reasonably priced. The room was comfortable, and the staff went out of there way to make sure all our need were met. 
I can give this hotel a 9 out of ten.
Location is perfect

219,Decent place to get some rest. Nothing special.,"Three of us stayed in a family room. The communal areas were very nice, but the room we had was very tired. It was clean enough, but was badly in need of some updating. The bathroom was again clean, but very very dated. Lovely orange tiles!

Maybe we got a room which hadn't been renovated, I don't honestly know. But if all the rooms are like ours, I'm surprised at the overall rating for the hotel.

All in all, a comfortable night's sleep as somewhere to get your head down. Didn't eat at the restaurant, so I can't comment on that.

Very convenient location, 2 minutes' walk from Connelly Luas station. Or 10 minutes' walk from the Spire and the rest of the city centre.",3,2012,11,12
219,Overnight stay for ND football weekend 9/1/12,"This hotel is a absolute mixed bag as the location is in a shabby part of Dublin and the lobby, waiting room,and bar are 1950 ish in decour and quite shabby. The rooms on the 7th floor were immaculate except they looked into the apartments of local residents so you could see occupants drying their clothes in their front room. The twin  beds were on rollers and everytime you sat on them they moved. The bathroom and shower was very modern and clean. The personal service from staff, particularly the gentleman who was the concierge. He was the most helpful person I've met on a trip in a decade. The price charged for the football weekend was about seven times the normal rate, ouch.  

Parking and loading and unloading a car was a nightmare because of the limited space available.",3,2012,11,12
219,Will be back soon! :),"Stayed here on 5th Nov 2012,Went to Nicki Minaj concert. Myself and two friends stayed in a three bed room 455, Nice hotel, close to O connell street,Friendly staff,lovely clean room,parking on site would recommend it highly to all.",5,2012,11,12
219,Location very good despite reservations,"Look, this hotel is within walking distance of O'Connell street and is opposite Connolly station for the dart and close to the Luas station. There are shops nearby. The hotel is friendly and the rooms fine. This is not 5 star but perfectly acceptable. Dublin is lovely, do go to the Guinness storehouse and jamesons distillery. But get into the wonderful pubs and drink Guinness..",4,2012,11,09
219,Fab!,"My recent visit to the North Star Hotel was only for a couple of nights and i really enjoyed it. Its situated smack bang in the centre of Dublin. Which is what i wanted, it wasnt near Temple Bar but that was only about 15 mins walk away. Ideal for the Connolly Train station which was literally over the road. So i was able to jump on the Dart train for a day out to Howth which was only coppers to pay. The bus station and tram was only 2 mins away too. I'd definately return to the North Star Hotel and may i also had that upon my arrival, my checking in time wasnt until 2pm. But they let me into my room at 10.30am!! and at no extra charge.This is a brill gesture to someone who had just arrived in a strange city and had been travelling since 5.30am that morning. The rooms where clean, welcoming and homely, short and sweet........... i loved it :-)",5,2012,11,09
219,Will definitely be back! :),"I stayed here for the Nicki Minaj Concert on 05/11/12. Arrived and I don't know why people complained about having to go upstairs to reception when there is only about 6 steps.. Such nice interior and such nice and friendly staff! We got our room cards not a problem, rooms were lovely, two tvs in the room, a balcony, a safe, a fridge, an ironing board and an iron, and two sinks and the comfiest bed ever!! Could live in it no problem! Also woman at reception was so hot (Brown hair and glasses..) Breakfast the next morning was beautiful. They also do room service to 3am! Only complaint is that I only booked one night wish I had stayed a few more nights! Don't know why people complained about trains either I only heard about 3 or 4 of them they don't wake you from your sleep but you do hear them if you were awake! But after all you are in Dublin city! Thank you North Star hotel!!",5,2012,11,07
219,Overnight Break,"I stay here when attending concerts in the o2, normally there is a shuttle bus running to the gigs, but this time there wasn't due to low demand, but there was a taxi rank right across from the hotel which was handy. Had a lovely room,109 I think. It looked like it was just newly refurbished. The room was to the front of the hotel, there was noise from the road but that didn't bother us. A continental breakfast was included in our package, but we didn't avail of it as we had to catch a flight home. Ordered of the room service menu, was very nice. Only thing that was wrong was there was no phone in our room so had to order the room service down at reception,but that wouldn't put me of staying here again. Will stay here again as its a good location for exploring the city and getting to the o2.",4,2012,11,05
219,clean and friendly,"this is the second time staying here and it is one of the best places i've stayed very clean very helpfull and friendly staff and well priced, will deffo stay here again",5,2012,11,03
219,Great location for train travel-- and great service,"This hotel is located just across the street from the train station which was very handy since we were back packing.  It was also a pleasant walk into areas that we wanted to visit, including Trinity College and Temple Bar.  However, the thing that I'll always remember is that en route from the airport to the hotel (via a city bus just outside the airport) I forgot a small bag.  After a few hours touring, I returned to the hotel and the concierge had located my bag and returned it to me.  Wow!  That was a great welcome into what I came to find as a very, very friendly and warm city.  

A cab driver reported that this was not a good neighborhood, but it certainly worked out well for our overnight visit so that we could easily board the train the next morning.",4,2012,11,03
219,Nice Hotel,"The hotel is placed near the city centre. So, when you don't have to walk long to be there. The rooms are big enough, but the showers are not very great (it did not do it very well).
The beds are very comfortable, so you can begin a day very relaxed.",4,2012,11,02
219,Basically sound and friendly hotel,"From the street the hotel doesn't look much but we were given a very warm welcome and the problem of the dozen or so steps up to the reception was overcome by a porter who immediately took our cases to our rooms. We had no problem with noise despite the proximity of the railway lines. Our rooms were clean although the decor was a bit tired. We ate in the restaurant and enjoyed the food. The bar, which is pub like, was an interesting place to finish the evening.",4,2012,10,31
219,location,"Overall very happy with hotel,very convenient location.Across road from train station and train runs over some rooms so would.recommend requesting rooms at back of hotel.",3,2012,10,30
219,Great base for seeing the sights of Dublin!,"Alot of the reviewers on here made me think carefully about whether to stay here or not, but I was gratefully very happy with our stay! We had a lovely room (one of the upgraded ones I think room 211) and were greeted on our early arrival to have our bags stored and map in hand ready to see the sights! The hotel is about a 10 minut walk from the main high street and 15-20 min walk to temple bar. The transport links are fantastic and you can get an airbus from the airport (open return) for ‚Ç¨10 a person. The bus will literally drop you off outside the hotel (stop 5). We walked all the way to Phoenix park which was lovely and def worth a visit! Alot of the reviewers comment in the noise in the hotel- well yes there is noise from the traffic outside, you can hear the trains from the train station directly opposite and you can here music from the bar below on the weekends but hello people this is a city hotel whey else do you expect, tranquility and peace and quiet?! I do have to add that none of these noises disrupted our stay in the slightest! The breakfast was great and def filled us up for the day!! So in summary- if you are looking for a very reasonably priced city hotel with great connections and accessibility look no further! ",4,2012,10,29
219,"Truly Awful Location, Noise and Customer Service","Firstly, this hotel is not located in central Dublin but is opposite the main station, the area is shabby, seedy and unsafe at night we were advised.

On checking in (to a so-called 4 star hotel) our Visa was charged in full without us even being allowed to view our room. This backed onto a traintrack and the windows shook when trains passed. We asked to change room due to the noise which was arranged but the next room was worse. We could hear a group of students talking quite clearly in the next room through the airvent in the bathroom. When I called the manager to our room his blunt response was ""Well don't listen then."" He reluctanly agreed a full refund.

Whilst back in Reception we noticed others were not being charged at check-in (we queried this and frankly didn't understand his explanation). At the same time hoards of 'exchange students' were walking through with pints of larger in their hands and some were even rolling on the sloping floor and having their pictures taken. The whole place felt more like a youth hostel than a 4-star hotel. We found another hotel in the Temple Bar area, lovely and quiet and they threw in free breakfast too. 

Would never return to this place!",1,2012,10,29
219,Good,"The lady at the reception, was very gentle.
The room was ok.
Close to the station.
Liked the atmosphere in the breakfast room.
Hope the smell of humid will be solved  within short time.",4,2012,10,26
219,Never again,"We stayed here after flying home as a treat and it was far from a treat. There was a broken gel nail on the chair. There was Brown marks in the bed sheets. The tv, Internet or phone did not work so everytime something was wrong we had to go down to reception which took 5 to 10 minutes as we were at the back of the hotel. I wanted to leave but we had had a drink in the bar and would not drive home after it.",1,2012,10,25
219,"Good hotel, with some minor annoyances","Generally speaking, this is a good hotel - decently priced, conveniently located near Connelly Station and within walking distance of the city centre, and with very comfortable, quiet and well-fitted-out rooms. However, beware of how you book your room! People who book through the hotel website direct get wi-fi and full breakfast included in the price - those who book through third parties do not. This wasn't clear on any of the third-party websites I was using, so be aware of that. It's also worth noting that the area around the hotel is not tremendously upmarket - not actually concerning but being right next to the railway station and bridge obviously makes the area slightly less desirable.",4,2012,10,24
219,Fantastic place to stay,"i was a bit scared after some of the reviews how wrong i was... Hotel is easy to find very central.. we where upgraded free of charge and without request which was a lovely surprise... we had a premier suite with a balcony, fridge and clean and lovely decorated room .. no noise from train at all.. the staff are lovely and room was cleaned everyday.. the bar is nice and when the bar was closing we where told we could go to resident lounge.. we where there talking till three thirty and we had ordered a pizza from the night porter as well as drinks.. we had room service which was lovely.. all in all i loved this hotel will be back... thanks for a great weekend",5,2012,10,24
219,All you need in Dublin at the right price,"Very convenient location - easy to reach with the airport bus and right across the street from the train Connelly Station. The hotel is not new, but it offers all that a reasonable traveler would need. Clean and spacious rooms with a good sleep quality, daily housekeeping, well arranged and tasty breakfast and all that at a very reasonable price. Wi-fi connection can be improved, so as the shower water pressure (both were very inconsistent).  Overall, the hotel is very good value for money, ideally located for walking tours and use of public transport and fairly comfortable.",4,2012,10,14
219,We'll be back...,"We spent 7 nights in the North Star Hotel and everything was perfect. The locations is great as it's about 10 minutes walk to O'Connell Street which is the main street of Dublin. Our room (3rd floor) was one of the best rooms we have ever stayed. The bed was very comfortable, there is a coffee/tea facility in the room so every morning we hadn't got to visit a cafe as we didn't choose to have breakfast in the hotel. Very clean hotel in general and not noisy at all. And what can i say for McCoy's (bar-restaurant of the hotel)...excellent traditional irish (and not only) food, great atmosphere and nice prices. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly (Mr. Kieron will give you any information you want about Dublin and he can book any tour you want for you). There was a well-organised gym for those who want to keep themselves fit. Afterwards, there is a Spar mini-market at the corner to Talbot Str, if you want to buy water,pastry etc. It was our dream to visit Dublin and we had a lovely week over there, this hotel made our vacations even better. We will visit again Dublin and Ireland and for sure North Star Hotel will be our ""hotel choice"", no doubt about it.",5,2012,10,14
219,Perfect break,"Invited friends from belfast down for their first visit to dublin, picked this hotel for handiness to city centre and close to train station. Got really good price for 2 twin standard rooms. Reception gave us an early checkin and were great for information on top spots. Room was perfect, decor very mod and bed super comfy! Yummy breakfast, great choice. Will certainly stay again.",5,2012,10,12
219,Great location,"Stayed one night in the North Star hotel with my 8 year old daughter while attending a concert in the O2.  The hotel provide a bus to concerts at ‚Ç¨7.50 return.
Right beside Connelly train station and about 10/15min walk to O'Connell Street with shops all the way.  Taxi rank opposite hotel, cost ‚Ç¨5.90 to get to O'Connell street, handy when raining.
Check in was quick, friendly and informative, there is also a conserige service, very helpful.
Our room was spotless, bit small, but was fine for the night.  The bathroom was tiny, but clean, plenty of towels and soap, but no face cloths.  Hairdryer, tea/coffee facilities,safe and TV in room ( our TV didnt work).
We were on the first floor and heard no noise from trains, very quiet during the night.  
Breakfast was hot and pleatiful, the usual hotel breakfast, buffett style self service.
ALL staff were VERY friendly, nice atmosphere.
There was a very modern gym room with plenty of equipment.
The hotel provide a luggage room, very handy when you have to check out but not ready to leave the area. Check out 11.30am.
Pleanty of seating areas to relax.  Nice bar area serving food.
Will definity stay here again when attending concerts or shows in the area.  Felt very safe on my own with a child.",4,2012,10,11
219,Will be back every time!,"We spent 3 nights, and couldn't choose a better hotel. It's true that the little stair to get to reception isn't the best, specially with big bags;
but if you need help, you have it...so don't complaint for details like that one, does not affect the great value of this hotel.
The staff is super kind, I am sorry that cannot remember the name of a lovely man, that checked us in and help us with everything needed and more during our stay.
We have a room facing at the back, on the 6th floor; huge room, great bed, perfectly clean, very big closet, with iron board; safe and mini fridge. Coffee and Tea selection.
The bathroom spacious enough, great water pressure, nice bathtub!
We had a little cute balcony; that was a plus‚Ä¶very quite street, you can see the shiny Spire, listen to the sound of the seagulls‚Ä¶lovely! 
The online pictures, and some of tripadvisors are so dated! The refurbished, is complete, or at least everywhere we saw. And the result is beautiful, from the reception all the way to our room, great taste wonderful design. 
Great location, around the corner of the Aerobus stop from the airport. And two block away from the stop to the airport.
We walked at all hours; to and from the hotel; and never felt that the area is not safe (I read that, while looking where to stay) 
So, definitely will be back, Dublin is beautiful and 3 nights weren't enough; and this hotel is going to have us back, every time!",5,2012,10,10
219,Great Accomodation for the Price,"As you would imagine, 3 lads away for a weekend in Dublin wouldn't really care about the hotel as they wouldn't be spending much time there !! However, rolling in at 4am each morning to a comfortable, well heated spacious room was the perfect ending to each evening. 
On arrival at the North Star, we found we had been upgraded to a Suite  FOC which was very kind of the establishment. The reception staff were helpful and knowledgable about the local areas and were friendly and courteous at all times.
The three of us were sharing 1 room, so space was at a premium. The suite was spacious with a sofa, relaxing chairs and a table, well stocked with Coffee to aid with the hangover and fresh linen daily. The beds were comfortable and the room itself was very quiet considering the local bus terminal was in a close proximity. The Location was good for us, as it was within a 10 minute stroll to the main shopping area, and took in many pubs along the way :)
I would definately recommend this hotel and allready have plans to come back in the future to try another Pint(s) of the Black Stuff",5,2012,10,09
219,Not what we'd expected but centrally located,"Due to the high rating of the hotel and photographs on tripadvisor we had a very different idea of what this place would be. The premier club suites (4 star) are separate from the North Star Hotel, so when we booked our very well-priced room, we expected that we were getting a great deal. The reception areas are decorated very nicely, but the rooms are more budget accommodation. It was incredibly noisy as we were next to the DART line and woken by trains in the morning, as well and hearing them during the day and evening. It is also a popular hotel with groups, so we were surrounded by a group of teenagers visiting Dublin, which did have an impact in terms of constant noise from music, knocking on doors etc. Had to pay for parking but the parking attendants were really helpful and the parking was secure. The wifi was also an extra cost, and with very poor quality connection - we did inform reception and they didn't charge us for the wifi as a result, but worth checking they've fixed the problem ahead of booking. Wouldn't stay here again but if you are in the market for clean budget accommodation you could do much worse.",3,2012,10,09
219,"nice hotel ,area not so hot !!!",I stayed here alone for one night . My room was lovely as were the staff . My room was cold at first but 2 guys came and  sorted it efficiently and quickly . Porter was very funny and reception staff great . The area is not very salubrious witnessed a drunken argument on 2 occasions . However thats not hotels fault !!,4,2012,10,08
219,Wonderful Dublin experience,We stayed one week at this hotel and what a good choice this was. The hotel was clean and had everything that I look for when I am away from home. The hotel is nothing fancy but it has a lot of character. The location was fab. It is located within walking distance from all the local town attractions and the train and metro stations for out of the way adventures. The pub next door was handy and the hotel restaurant was wonderful. The staff was friendly and very helpful. It was well priced. I would stay here again.,4,2012,10,08
219,Great Hotel with Pub Alongside,"We travelled to Dublin on a stag weekend and stayed for 3 nights in the premier rooms, rooms are clean and tidy and all requests were catered for, of the nine rooms we had, 5 had balconys and four fully opening windows. The trains passed close by, but its to be expected with a station directly opppsite. Highly Recommended. The pub alongside had pleasent staff who were helpful and understanding, even when drunk...",4,2012,10,03
219,"Good location, average room","This hotel is located very close to the centre of Dublin so easy to walk in and explore the city. The rooms are fairly average but comfortable and clean, think Travelodge. Staff were friendly and helpful. No official parking for the hotel but we managed to find a street around the corner, otherwise I believe you would have to pay for a local car park",3,2012,10,03
219,"Decent Enough if you get it at a low price, and are only staying 1-2 nights","This hotel is centrally located, and close to Connolly st Station, perhaps a little to close, as the reception area shakes when a train runs over the top of the building.

It is nicely decorated inside, and the rooms are clean and of a decent size.  I paid ¬£65.00 for 1 night, and that is just about the right price, any more and it is not worth it.

The WIFI did not work in the rooms, and heard several guests complaining of the issue.

The hotel is located in a very dodgy area, my room overlooked an alleyway where there were several people screaming and fighting all night long.

Perfect if your just going to dublin on a Hen or Stag do, but not good if your working and need a good nights sleep.",3,2012,10,01
219,All Ireland Mayo v Donegal Stay,"Stayed at this Hotel For the All Ireland Football Final
Room was very nice but the main bar was a big let down, Very dirty
Got a drink that was 9 months out of date, complained and on doing so i had to ask the girl did she find out about it after waiting at least 10 mins,as i was eating in the Restaurant, She said that the bar staff checked the fridge and there were some bottles in there from 2011, which was worse again. She offered me draught but i declined.
God only knows what that was like, all i can say is that i pity those who drank it without knowing it was off
Food in restaurant very poor, food seemed to be half cooked, really terrible i would say.
Breakfast the next morning was good and plenty of it but i feel that this hotel is not great value for money. Good location straight across from Connolly Station, Dont know if i would stay there again

 
Breakfast the next morning was nice and good selection available",3,2012,09,28
219,Not bad!,"Stayed here when working in the area , hotel was ok Staff were polite ,it  done what I needed , train station directly across from the hotel but the noise for me was not bad . Rooms were clean and warm , my shower was rubbish with no power at all . 
Bar food just ok , would recommend spending a little more to eat in the hotel restaurant or eating out with the hotel , breakfast was good with a good choice . 
Overall slightly better than travel lodge .
You will have to pay for wifi access which I was disappointed about but this is may be the norm for bigger hotels . 
I would use again if in the area",4,2012,09,26
219,Very charming hotel,"I liked this hotel very much as it is not one of this standardized chain hotels. The room seemed to be recently refurbished, was rather big and very  clean. Even though the room was facing to the busy road in front of connolly station it was quiet thanks to the sound-proof window. The hotel is very centrally located and all tourist attractions are within walking distance. The breakfast was included in the rate and the selection was nice. The breakfast room however was located in the basement and therefore without windows which was strange. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I liked the transfer to the airport for only 5‚Ç¨.",4,2012,09,25
219,Very poor,"This is really a pub with rooms. Granted reception and the corridors have been given a lick of paint. No lift to reception and the room I was given was grim.  Right next to the railway, stained carpet - not touched since the 80's and it smelt of food.  A tiny old tv and the bathroom was dreadful.  This cost ‚Ç¨170 a night - which is a complete rip off.  It is also located in a fairly run down area of Dublin.  The only positive was the wireless Internet in the bedroom which worked well.",1,2012,09,22
219,Great location,"I stayed at the North Star in Dublin with friends over the summer.  The reason we were in Dublin was for the Springsteen concert.  It was booked at the last minute so we didn't do a lot of research, we were just glad to have a place to stay.  As it turns out, the location was excellent.  Its  across the road from a taxi stand and within a minutes walk of the Red Luas stop.  Its also next to Connolly Station which services DART and Commuter Lines. 

The hotel itself was surprisingly good.  I'd seen people complain about the noise of trains, traffic etc and I didn't experience that at all.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, staff friendly, service was great and the breakfast was the best I've had in a long time.  Highly recommend it.  I was so impressed with the hotel that I've rebooked it for November again.  

However‚Ä¶ for concert goers, the hotel offers a bus service (for a fee) to the RDS - Avoid It.  I spoke with some of the concert goers afterwards and they weren't impressed.  The bus came late, was a mini bus, people were left behind for a later bus, and they barely made it in traffic.  They ended up walking the last ten minutes.  
We took the DART to the RDS.  That only takes a few minutes, and when you get off the DART, you're only a few minutes walk to the stadium, just follow the crowd.  Here's a tip, buy a return ticket so you don't have to queue at the station on the return journey, you might miss the last train!",4,2012,09,17
219,Disappointing,"Worst hotel out paid 200 Euro,s for 2 nights for poor accommodation food and service! Most definitely won't be back. Save your money look for something better.
No wifi rooms are very outdated needs a total revamp and some customer service training the 1st man we met at reception 1st floor was rude and abrupt nothing nice to say, appeared a hassle to answer some general questions regards to local knowledge.
 However the location was pretty good close to trains and buses, for those wanting to sight see.",1,2012,09,17
219,Time Out,We choose North Star for our two night stay during the Leonard Cohen concert. We were made very welcome by all staff. Ciaran did hotel proud sorting bus and luas journeys for us. Thanks. The room was lovely food excellent . We would highly and have already recommended North Star to our friends and families,4,2012,09,16
219,Good Location to Transport and Shopping,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a Welcome to Dublin pack.  I think this hotel has 2 ratings as the part we stay at was 3 stars but they do have Premier suites as well.  Don't know how you book those rooms or whether it is for business travellers

Hotel is suited close to transport, Tram, bus station and trains.  Taxi are also situated across the road. We had airport transfer tickets included in our package and that bus stop is also within walking distance.  

The worst thing about this hotel is, reception is located on the 2nd floor and you have to carry your bags up 12 stairs as there is no lift.  We were on the 2nd floor (room 260) so there was another 4 stairs up to our room as the hotel is on all different levels.  There was a lift in the back section of the hotel which took you to the gym and breakfast area and the Premier suites.

Bathroom was big, well bigger then most.  Tea/coffee in room and aircon.  The mattresses and pillows had seen better days and should have been replaced years ago.  We had a double and single in our room but both had big banana shaped dints in them so you were always rolling to the centre.  We also had roadworks happening outside our room which reception said they were unaware was happening!!! but they gave us free breakfast as compensation (Value 21.90 euro).

Breakfast was great. Large variety and full hot Irish breakfast.  Easy walk to O'Connell street (main street) via Talbot street.  Short walk to the start of the Hop on Hop off bus stop as well.

Resident's lounge room with vending machines and pay internet and a printer. Overall we would probably stay here again because of the location",4,2012,09,14
219,Great Craic for Rugby weekend,Stayed here for Ireland v Wales rugby match. Short walk to city centre. Room comfortable and fine for 3 guys who weren't likely to spend much time in the room ! Good staff at reception and in the bar. Plenty of bars close by and not too much staggering distance from Temple Bar.,4,2012,09,13
219,Doesn't Look like the Pictures,"We stayed one night in the North Star Hotel.  The best thing about was probably the location.  You had to carry your luggage up about 10 stairs to get to reception, there is no elevator.  The place looked dingy and beat up.  We asked for a double room and got a triple, in the back of the hotel and heard the train everytime it went by.  We were not inspired to eat breakfast there.  Since it was the last night of our trip and just a place to spend the night after an exhausting day it didn't impact our vacation, but I wouldn't stay there as a hotel choice for more than that.  They charge 5 euro each for a shuttle to the airport and 4.95 euro to use the internet for an hour.  The rooms and entire hotel was very dingy and dated as well.  When I see the pictures on-line I have to laugh it looks nothing like that.  They do have apparently ""upgraded"" rooms for a larger price.  We paid 90 euro 127 with taxes etc.  If I stayed longer I might have opted for the upgrade.  I really don't complain much, but besides the location it didn't offer much.",2,2012,09,11
219,Definitely recommend for a well located hotel,"We stayed here for a couple of nights and really enjoyed our visit. The room was very clean and tidy and the bed was heavenly. Probably the best hotel bed I've ever slept in - really big, soft with plenty of pillows. It took us a bit of time to find the hotel but once we knew where we were going it was easy. 

There isnt a lot directly around the hotel that we took notice of however, I'm sure there is places to eat/drink nearby. It's right next to the train station which was really convenient and near to the bus station. However, we had no noise at all from either. 

The walk is fairly short to the main street. If we were to come to Dublin again we would definitely stay here or recommend it however, I personally didnt fall in love with Dublin as a city.",4,2012,09,06
219,Wasn't worth the price but I had very limited options,"Very easy to get to from the Hotel, I took the Airlink to Connelly Station and it was right there. This hotel was about a 20 minute walk from the Temple Bar area or you could take the Luas from the Tram station across the road (1.60 if you stayed in the zone). This tram would also take you to the Jameson Distillery and the Guinness Store house. I found that it was a little far out of the way and I would have liked to stay close to Temple bar but it was sold out because of the Navy vs Notre Dame game. We ended up paying 200 euro‚Äôs a night and when I told the locals about it they couldn‚Äôt believe it! No rooms were available until after 4pm so they upgraded us to a suite. The suite was very large, three beds and it had a hair dryer. No Fridge, no clock and no tissue paper. The room backed on to an alley with an apartment behind it but there always seemed to be people out there talking loudly and the windows didn‚Äôt close all the way. Wireless was NOT included and cost 3 euro for the first 20 minutes (pretty much every pub had free wireless). The bathroom was okay, shower worked fine. The hallways looked way nicer than the rooms oh! And the doors always slammed so at night when I was trying to sleep all I could here was people slamming doors! I had to check out by 11:30 so I asked them to hold my bags and they charged me 3 euro per bag. I tried to tell them that at 200 per night they could hold my bags but they wouldn‚Äôt budge so I paid the 3 euros‚Ä¶ But back to the upsides, it was clean, beds were pretty good, the concierge service was amazing, the guys were able to help me find everything I wanted. I wouldn‚Äôt stay at this hotel again.",2,2012,09,04
219,"Centrally located, good value for money","Stayed here before, and was very happy with the suite. This time perhaps not as happy, although it was still very nice. Brought the car this time, car park attendant was very rude and abrupt, needs to be told to allow for people that have not used the car park before. He was very put out that we were attempting to park the car ourselves. We did not know that he parked the cars and so presumed we were doing the right thing. Whilst trying to park, he very rudely asked what we were trying to do! When we said we were parking the car, he said No you're not, I am!! Very rude!!
Suite was supposed to be the same more or less as the last time we stayed, however, the room was quite a bit smaller, squeaky floorboards, electric sockets that did not work, fan in bathroom didn't work, and even though we got the wireless free as we had booked online, we would not have paid for it anyway, as it kept cutting out, and we spent most of time refreshing. Very poor signal strength on it. 
Having said that, I would still stay here, as it is very central, and the staff are excellent, it was just perhaps a case of inconsistency in standard of rooms.  Breakfast is excellent. Still worthwhile staying, Felt that the things that were wrong, were not going to ruin our stay so did not want to cause a fuss,as the staff were under strain as the hotel was fully booked up at the time we stayed, but I still stand by what I say about the car park attendant!!",4,2012,09,04
219,Comfortable Stay,"I had a good time with the North Star Hotel. I stayed for 3 nights during August 2012. The location was very convenience. It only takes 15 to 20 mins walk distance to the town centre. There a lot of restaurants and shops nearby too. Very central to the railway station and bus stop. There are shuttle bus run from the airport to the hotel and vice versa. The bed was very comfortable with soft pillows and high quality beddings. They have very very hot water shower.They serve very nice full Irish breakfast with a variety of fruits and drinks in buffet style. The only bad thing was they charge for wifi service, however, the manager promised me I will be given complimentary services in my next return such as free wifi service and upgrading my room. I would definately recommend this hotel to you if you are thinking of visiting Dublin.",5,2012,09,03
219,Return Stay,"After a previous visit my mother and i were very kindly organised a return stay by North Star and in particular Duty Manager Damien,  The room was lovely and quiet, all facilities, including flat screen Tv,  tea/coffe, comfy beds, fridge, nice bathroom etc, great view from the top floor of the hotel looking over Dublin skyline towards Croke park. Breakfast was good. a minute or two from Bus Aras and Connolly station, within wlaking distance of O'Connell st , had a lovely stay and would return again.( had to sign in with a new account on Trip advisor as it would not let me update or review this hotel again for 3 months but wanted to ensure i give credit where its due :) )",5,2012,08,30
219,Short stay,"We enjoyed our stay in the North Star hotel and found the staff most helpful and courteous,our suite was lovely,very spacious and clean,we chose this hotel as we availed of the theatre package which included B&B&1D and the theatre tickets.The food was great and the waitress who looked after us for dinner was so kind to literally flag down a taxi to take us to the theatre,would definately stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin.We were only a short bus journey to the city centre.",4,2012,08,19
219,"Good hotel, nice prices","The entire experience was really good, the room was great, almost perfect, but we were disappointed to find that our bed was actually two single beds pushed together. The staff were nice, would stay there again.",3,2012,08,16
219,Borderline location,"This hotel is located on the edge of the tourist district, with an elevated rail track running in front. The neighborhood is not one that I as a woman would feel comfortable walking alone, or even with hubby at night. Always turn right when you walk out the lobby door. That is the biggest downside.

I did not stay in the premier suites, I sayed in the cheapo lower suites. They are well worn. The staff does an admirable job of keeping them clean, but you can only do so much without a renovation. You get what you pay for.

The staff however, was great. Very helpful and accommodating. If you drive, parking is extra and run by an external organization. The parking is manned 24x7, which was very helpful. The spaces are tight (by American standards...)

There were a lot of young people who were in the hotel. Its close to the rail station (very close), and thus convenient. And it is cheap, relatively speaking. Maybe I'm getting old and comfortable (above 30 and work full time), so this is not a hotel I can recommend or would choose ( husband arranged this vacation...never again without my input.)

We basically only slept here. Did not eat in this hotel at all, so cannot comment on food quality.",2,2012,08,16
219,best ever hotel experience   ABG and SG,"Just back from a great weekend at the North Star hotel Dublin. got upgraded to premier club suite for our wedding anniversary weekend at no extra charge. Fantastic altogether very spacious suite , most comfortable king sized bed ,great breakfast quantity and quality of food excellent. Super location for everything, Dart across the road in Connolly station. Luas on doorstep literally and just a few mins walk to O;connell Street,  Abbey theatre nearby also. G ood food in hotel restaurants too. Extremely helpful and friendly staff from reception to breakfast room . Greeted with a smile by staff esp young French lady from Montpellier . She is pure class. After experiencing this hotel will be staying there whenever we go back to Dublin . Nowhere else compares !Even gives loan of umbrella if needed . Fortunately we didn't need it at all.Rooms spotlessly clean . Well  done to all at the North Star much appreciated .",5,2012,08,15
219,Great value accommodation right in the centre of Dublin,"Stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of a tour of Ireland. Price was extremely good (cheaper than anywhere else we stayed in Ireland) and it was a 5 minute walk to O'Connell Street.

Room was a good size and comfortable (although I suspect we got an upgrade to a premium one), and the wifi was free. Didn't pay the extra for a full breakfast but the included continental was perfectly sufficient.

Only other food we tried was in the bar (a good mix of locals and visitors in there). Was tasty and still very cheap for a hotel bar.

Staff were polite and had reasonable local knowledge also.",4,2012,08,14
219,North Star experience,"Located right in front of Connolly station, The North Star hotel offers a convenient option for weary travellers coming to Dublin. Moreover, it is spotlessly clean, comfortably and even lavishly furnished, and run by some of the most courteous and efficient staff it has ever been my pleasure to deal with, The staff are multilingual and have a genuine desire to ensure that each guest has the best possible stay. Our room was large, well furnished and well supplied with everything we could need. The breakfast was extensive and everything was well presented and well prepared. The dining room, the place settings, even the coffee was perfect. The only somewhat perplexing thing was the use of the WiFi, but to be honest I didn't make much of an effort to learn more; I am confident that had I asked, the matter would have been quickly resolved. A well-deserved 5 stars!",5,2012,08,14
219,Lovely stay,"Stayed at the North Star Hotel in Dublin for a long weekend in August 2012. From the outset, a very attractive hotel, took us a while to find but that was our own fault! Everyone at reception very friendly and helpful and were on 24/7. We stayed in one of the premier rooms on the 6th floor, really nice room, massive bed and extremely comfy! We were looking on the train station which didn't bother me except you could hear trains at night but that couldn't really be helped! Would go there again without a doubt, overall had a lovely stay at the North Star Hotel.",4,2012,08,14
219,Good value,"A bit odd, having to carry bags up to reception, but I am sure someone would have carried our bags if we had asked: the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had asked for a quiet room, which did not have much of a view but there was no noise. The pillows were rather hard and it wasn't easy to get wet in the shower as it wasn't very powerful, but it was all clean. Good breakfast and the hotel is not in the most salubrious area but it is very convenient for all of the places of interest, with a good selection of pubs and restaurants nearby. All in all, very good value.",3,2012,08,09
219,Very good one night stay but with a caveat !,"Stayed for one night. We had one of the renovated rooms on the 6th floor. Room was very good, clean and spacious and  super comfortable queen size bed. The bathroom was OK, although the lighting is poor and not much fun when shaving !
The room had a balcony but the view very depressing and the railway runs past. Even with windows closed you can still hearth trains. Thankfully they do not run all night. The breakfast was very good although the breakfast room is a bit glum. It is in the basement and has no windows.
THe Hotel is very near the Connelly Train Station and Eireann Bus Depot, so is well situated.
The room for ‚Ç¨111 including breakfast for two was OK. Would probably stay there again when in Dublin.
Unfortunately the Shuttle to the Airport broke down when we were due to leave. However, the Concierge immediately volunteered to drive us in his private car to the Airport ! Very much appreciated !!!!!",4,2012,08,08
219,Great location,"Second time staying here. Great location, nice big room with both a double and single bed. Lovely friendly check in and check out. Breakfast was plentiful, fresh and served by polite staff. Great convenient location, would recommend this hotel for a city / shopping break!",5,2012,08,06
219,Loud music from Bar,"Stayed on saturday night 4 august 2012,  with my elderly mum and asked for a quiet room, we were checked into room 109 which is a lovely upgraded, clean room, However at 9.30 loud music started.  Rooms on this floor are directly above the bar which has live music, friday, saturday and sunday nights. (was NOT told this when we checked in when we enquired for a quiet room) I phoned recepton and complained and was told it would stop at 11 so we persevered and it stopped at 10.50 only to resume at 11.05, so the first receptionist lied to us.  I asked for the manager and was finally moved at 11.30, (mum having to get dressed again).  This spoilt our enjoyement of what should have been a quiet stay. Breakfast was average, by the time we ate at 9:30AM it was luke warm and not very hot, to be expected at that time i suppose. Plus when we checked out there was a surcharge of 3 Euro for each bag they stored for us. While rooms on the 1st floor are refurbished, rooms on the remaininig floors are older quality but clean. Beside Connolly station and on main, front of hotel rooms, can hear some train/traffic  noise but nothing too bad. 80 odd Euro for 2 for 1 night including breakfast.",3,2012,08,06
219,A decent hotel,"Stayes here for 3 nights, having found a deal through booking.com for an executive room. Room was freshly decorated and clean. Only reason I gave it 4/5 was for a stain on the decorative throw. 
The staff were lovely and helpful when needed. 
The location was handy, while not quite bang in the centre we could walk it, even in high heels. Plenty of shops nearby for snacks and drinks. ",4,2012,08,06
219,"Amazing hotel , amazing stay","I had a great stay in the north star hotel last week , it is situated in a great location in the city centre which made it  very convenient   to go shopping and to commute around Dublin .Also the staff were very helpful and friendly . The rooms were fantastic , newly decorated , beautiful comfortable pillow top beds ,  and very clean , had a great sleep . The food was delicious in the restraunt and all those elements made my stay very enjoyable and relaxing ",5,2012,08,03
219,nice enough hotel,"most things ok,nice room,spacious,clean,about 15 min walk from main shopping area,only a few points were we had no air con in room like it said on the write up!water not hot enough(for hubby) i found it ok & our extractor in bathroom didnt work,we did eat in restaurant 1st night hubby had steak, said it was lovely i had the fish n chips,was horrible the fish tasted of nothing,i had actually had some 2days previous to that off a van in france which was far tastier!!!!so i would say they are not actually using (COD)!!",3,2012,08,03
219,Not a great experience,"We stayed here last November. When we arrived the heating in the room was broken so were moved to another which was not as nice as the first. We were moved to a room where the train track was just outside the window so was very noisy in the early hours of the morning. At first the staff were very kind and helpful but unfortunately, when we asked for a refund for the price difference in the rooms they put up a massive fuss which was rather unfair considering we should of got about ¬£30 back. Eventually we agreed that they could pay our bus fair to the airport and 20% off our next visit instead of a refund purely because if we waited much longer we would have missed our flight.
The location was very good for what we payed. Room was okay, clean and quite small. But overall, unfortunately we had a rather unpleasant experience so won't be staying there.",1,2012,08,02
219,"Has seen better days, but serves its purpose","This place has had a fair bit of wear and tear over the years and it's starting to show in places, but it's still not a bad hotel for a three star. And the location's not bad either, if you don't mind a little bit of extra walking to get to the main tourist attractions. I also found the rates to be less expensive than I would've expected them to be. From what I saw, most of the rooms on our floor also contained a single bed in addition to a double, but the rooms are quite large and comfortable and there's no shortage of space. The bathroom facilities were also clean and well maintained. They're not the most modern of rooms when it comes to furnishings and the like, but everything that you might need is provided, including tea and coffee making facilities. The staff are pleasant and they do a nice, buffet style breakfast between eight and ten O'clock, so you don't have to get up too early in order not to miss it. Our room did face onto the railway line, but the noise was only minimal and we certainly didn't lose any sleep because of it. The hotel does have a large fitness room that was quite impressive and there is also a large bar attached to the premise that is more like a pub, which can be accessed from the hotel lobby or directly from the street. One thing that I did find rather inconvenient, though, was being locked out of the hotel after arriving back shortly after midnight. There is a doorbell and it wasn't long before it was answered. This wouldn't have been a problem, except there were one or two male characters hanging about close to the entrance that obviously weren't hotel guests and my wife was made to feel slightly on edge. Therefore, this is not an ideal situation for female guests that might wish to return to the hotel late without an escort. Other than that, I can't complain really.",3,2012,08,02
219,Pleasant stay,"Have nothing bad to say about this hotel. Very handy as it is central location easy to find as it is right beside the train station! Our room was great, a good size nicely decorated and spacious! The hotel is nicely decorated and very clean and deserves more than 3 stars! Staff are very helpful for tips and helping you find places! We had dinner in the hotel as part of the package and food was really nice and plenty to choose from on the menu! The breakfast is even better though, so much selection and everything is cooked to perfection it is help yourself which is better i think! The breakfast room is also nice and staff here are so friendly! Great hotel for a wee weekend away and great location! Not 5 star quality but you pay for what you get! We got it through a deal through NI Rail and got the train tickets as part of the deal which was a brilliant price, so check that out before you buy!",5,2012,07,30
219,Stay away!,"Pros 
- parking with only 7 euro a day

Cons
- old rooms
- small rooms
- very dirty bathroom
- you cannot wash yourself properly because the water barely flows.
- no minibar
- no wifi

I don't know what to say more, but it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had.",2,2012,07,29
219,great place to stay,"good location to the centre, lovely room which was large, staff very freindly and helpfull, food great (would not be fine dinning but good honest cooking).  This was our first time in this hoilday have experinced a number of Dublin hotels before.  We will be using the North Star again.  Value for money the best hotel we have stay in.",5,2012,07,29
219,Great rooms - shame about the noise,"We stayed here to attend a concert at Landsdown road. The hotel was in the perfect location for the train station and dart to Landsdown - literally right across the road. However, this perfect location came with the slight drawback of considerable noise from trains/darts. Thankfully they do not run 24-7, so I managed to grab a few good hours sleep. It is also a 5 minute walk away from O'Connell street (exit the hotel and turn right, then turn right at the spar and follow this road - you will see the large ""needle"" in the distance. This is O'Connell street.

First impressions of the hotel are not great, it looks a little like an old mans pub, and this theme does not change until you actually go up a flight of stars to the reception area.

The rooms themselves are lovely. We stayed in a premium/deluxe room - which are shown in the professional photos with king sized beds, modern furnishing and a well equiped bathroom, complete with rain shower. Only negative - a few uncomfortable pillows! I can not comment on the standard rooms, but if the photos are anything to go by I would recommend going for the more pricey deluxe rooms.

We ate in the pub downstairs. This has the old man theme from before. However the food was decent and well priced. I had a 12inch pizza for 7euros and my partner had a fish pie which tasted yummy for around 8. The beers are very well priced, in fact they seemed cheaper than most other pubs!

All in all a good hotel for a night or two. Brilliant location. Only major concern is the noise - take ear plugs if you are a light sleeper like me. And if you can splash out on better rooms. Would definitely stay again for a quick trip.",4,2012,07,27
219,A decent hotel extremely convenient to the train station.,"We stayed here for two nights as part of our 6 day Ireland rail tour.  The reception area is on the second floor with no apparent access to an elevator.  Consequently, we had to carry our bags to the second floor in order to check in.  The person at the front desk was pleasant and helpful.  Our rooms (2 of them) were quiet, air conditioned (not that we really needed it) a decent size, and clean with very nice bed linens.  I point out the bed linens because the underlying beds were a tad lumpy.  We didn't have the opportunity to try the breakfast, but the pub had a decent, if somewhat limited beer selection, and there was a convenience store just two doors down.  Overall our stay was fine...the best part...we only had to cross a street to catch our early train to Belfast and the Giants Causeway tour.",4,2012,07,22
219,Excellent rooms and friendly staff,"I picked the North Star to stay in when recently in Dublin for business. An excellently located hotel. My room was beautifully decorated - very modern, with everything you could possibly need. I checked in late and the staff were so accommodating with all I needed. The bed was very comfy! Nothing was a problem. The North Star excels with a friendly cosy atmosphere, and excellent service. I would definitely recommend it for a city centre stay in Dublin.",5,2012,07,18
219,Welcoming staff pleasant stay.,"Me and my friends visited north star hotel as we came to Dublin for all our 30th birthdays, the reception staff were lovely and helpful, late checkout and calling us a taxi, and late night snacks wasn't a problem.
The hotel is average with refurbished parts, fine for a girlie weekend away, nice and clean extra tea & coffee provided by the maid :) There are  only two things to bear in mind if booking this hotel, 1 location perfect for all attractions but the area was not recommended for us girls to walk around late on our own so we stuck together, the was alot of beggars and I think the next street along their is a place for homeless people/drunks/drug users. ( so the taxi man said.!!!) so not recommended if u may have to walk alone, and 2 the train line literally runs through the hotel and was noisy, so if you want a quiet hotel I wouldn't recommend.
But if we went again I would stay in a group but not for 2/3 people. Most people looked horrified when we said we were staying their but it was ok.",3,2012,07,17
219,"40th birthday bash, the Kettering massive do Dublin","11 of us stayed here when we went to Dublin for some of our 40th's, (great excuse!) the hotel, staff and food could not be faulted. It was in a great central location but was quiet enough not that we did much sleeping. The breakfast was excellent and the bar meals particularly good value especially the minute steaks..",5,2012,07,15
219,awful place to stay,"Inside the room a strong smell of molt comes from the AC. Also its price/quality and service/quality are far below average. A lot of noise from car traffic and trains are keeping you awake and the service level is really bad. The beds are worn down and you wake up with large back pain. Also no personal interest from people working there.
Strong advice to stay away, much better places to find at cheaper hotels which I stayed at before",1,2012,07,13
219,Pleasant stay,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay in the North star hotel.On our approach to the hotel we were a little disappointed as it looked a little dull and drab with the train line directly overhead.The reception is up a few stairs which could be awkward for persons with difficulty with stairs,but there is a porter who is very helpfull and will take your cases up.
Our reservations were overcome with the friendliness of the reception staff,in fact all of the staff were excellant.Our room was very comfortable and spacious with a double and a single bed.and very quiet.The room did have an ashtay which did surprise us but did explain the smell of cigarettes which you could smell as soon as you left the lift on our floor.A few niggles in the bathroom,no hook on door to hang towels and bath panel broke,but these were very minor and did not detract from a very pleasant stay.The breakfasts were excellant with choice of cereals.fruit,toast and full cooked breakfast which was lovely.The hotel is fairly well placed in relation to the main shopping areas,O'Connell street,Temple bar and Graffton street,about half a mile walk.Luas station is just across the road so is very handy.Would definately recommend this hotel and would happily stay again.",4,2012,07,11
219,Fantastic customer service,"The receptionists are fantastic. Friendly,happy girls who couldn't have been more welcoming. Really made you feel at home. Got offered discount of our next stay as we mentioned the noise from the generator which we could hear all night. There is nothing you can do about the constant train noise. The meal was lovely, atmosphere was great,the rooms were lovely -will definately be back! Right beside connelly station..",4,2012,07,10
219,Great Location Lovely Friendly Staff,"Stayed in this hotel over the weekend for 2  nights. The location is great, not far from O'Connell Street and only across the road from the Luas at Connolly Station. The staff were very friendly. Breakfast was fine, and is until 11am on a Sunday! The only bad thing I could say about the hotel is that our room smelled quite strongly of smoke, as did the whole level that our room was on. I'm asthmatic and I pick up on the smell of smoke straight away so maybe it's just me that can get it! Also the parking... the staff take your car and park it for you, which is fine,  but when we were leaving we went to collect our car and we had to wait around 15 minutes in the rain because our car was parked behind about 5 other cars, which all had to be moved! Otherwise I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel. Was very good value and would return again if I was attending a concert for a night.",4,2012,07,10
219,Excellent value,"We got a late deal ‚Ç¨67.5 with continental breakfast. Spacious room with modern con and nice simple furniture, very clean . Bath\ shower good. The room was too warm but there was air- conditioning so it was good. Paid extra ‚Ç¨5 for full Irish breakfast which was well-worthed. Plenty of hot food selection and were cooked perfectly, though no cold meat available still very good. Car parking was a little confuse, but again with ‚Ç¨7 per day, it was not bad at all. Will stay again and recommend to friends. North Star is extremely good for a budget 3 star rating hotel.",4,2012,07,10
219,Nicely renovated property in a good location,"We spent 3 nights at the North Star Hotel with a group of 35 people.  This is clearly an older property that has gone through some recent renovations.  We found the front desk and restaurant staff to be EXCELLENT and the rooms to be very comfortable.  

We had 2 rooms both with king-size beds and they were spacious and very clean.  We were facing the train station but did not hear trains overnight so it was not an issue for us.  Breakfast was fine - not great, but enough options to please most everyone in our group.  The offered a reduced WiFi rate for multiple days.  Honestly I am not sure why they don't just include WiFi in the daily rate, but I suppose it is a way to generate some extra revenue.  

Quick walk to most central Dublin shopping and pubs.  Also very easy to catch a train or bus out front and get where you need to go.",4,2012,07,10
219,Great staff,"Stayed at the hotel from July 1 to 4th asked for a quiet room which they provided without any problem. room was of a good standard well lit and comfortable furnishings. The food was very good but not a wide menu. The highlight of the hotel was the attitude of the staff, they were brilliant!  great bar and lively at the weekends with good entertainment. Very handy for all areas of Dublin",4,2012,07,05
219,Train spotting,"Stayed at this hotel for three horrendous notes
I can supply anyone that wishes the train schedule as I am sure our room served as a temporary station at one time
It was absolutely unbearable.when we asked for a room away from the train tracks we where informed that we would need to pay an upgrade fee??
How ridiculous is that when we booked we where not informed that if you did appreciate locomotives the rate was way more expensive?
In no way shape or form would I recommend this hotel I can not believe it has a positive response from anyone who stayed there unless of course they where hard of hearing or sight impared",1,2012,07,02
219,Good hotel & great location,"stayed there for 2 nights and cannot complain about anything. rooms are basic but offer everything you need. The hotel is perfectly located, only minutes from anywhere in Dublin. Staff are holpful and friendly and room are clean, all for a reasonably cheap price for dublin!",4,2012,07,01
219,A night in Dublin,"My wife and I went to see Riverdance on 28th June. Fantastic show. We booked into North Star, as its location was close to railway station.(Big plus but also a little minus) Reception was handled in a very friendly and professional manner. Our room on the 6th floor was a very good size.Great big comfortable bed. Bathroom adequate, shower great . Had lunch in the bar. Service was courteous  friendly and quick. Later dinner in the dining room was superb. Again service was first class. Staff very friendly. Great nights sleep, though got wakened when trains started running.(that was the little minus)
Had a full cooked breakfast and set od for a full days sight seeing.Will stay here again",4,2012,06,30
219,Lovely hotel,Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel for a concert that we were attending and were pleasantly surprised.  We booked through bookings.com so had pre paid for our stay.  Room clean and it was lovely to have a balcony.  Would definitely stay in this hotel again. We found most staff very friendly and our room was clean but some of the hotel could have done with a bit of a hoover!   Bed very comfortable.,4,2012,06,29
219,The little things were awful,"Where do I start? We rang the hotel twice on arrival in Dublin for better directions to get there and we were hung up on twice. Stayed in this hotel for two nights to go to a concert and see the sights. Payment was demanded immediately on arrival and because we didnt have a credit card - we hadn't even entered the room and we were paying upfront. We were upgraded to a premier room as there was a difficulty with our booking. The room was standard in my opinion like most hotels I've been in but it did have a balcony which probably gave it its ""premier"" status. If this is the case I would not like to see the standard rooms. We paid in full on the second morning and were being charged for watching a movie and listening to music when we were at a conert the night before?!?!? If the air conditioning was not in the room we would have cooked in our beds - the corridors and breakfast room were offensively warm.The breakfast was good in fairness. We had a quick meal in the bar below the hotel so we could make the concert. The menu read very well and the prices were so reasonable. DO NOT EAT THERE. The half stuffed roast chicken was not stuffed - when stuffing was requested it came out in a bowl and looked awful. The food was cold and just terrible. Finally car parking - we availed of the private car parking at the back of the hotel. The car was moved eight times in the three days and two nights we were in dublin. This is crazy! We had no access to it unless the attendants were in the office. Why is there a need to constantly move the cars around? I might be moaning but I really do not feel like I am being unreasonable. We stayed in a hotel only two weeks before and it was amazing. This place was poor for ‚Ç¨277 for the two nights and we both agreed we would never stay here again. Its location is excellent but thats the only thing that could be called excellent.",2,2012,06,28
219,"Great location, friendly staff","I was a bit dubious about this hotel as it has received mixed reviews. However it was only for one night as we were going to a concert in Croke Park.  Directly across the street from Connolly train station and an easy 15 minute walk to Croke Park so very convenient.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  We arrived at 1.20pm and were given our room (with a complimentary upgrade) straight away.  Room clean and modern, nice bathroom, big TV, plenty of tea & coffee. Very quiet and really comfy beds made for a great nights sleep.  Good breakfast selection but the breakfast room was very warm and very busy so we took our breakfast up to the room, no problem.  All in all a great place to stay at a very reasonable price.",4,2012,06,27
219,Great stay,"Stayed on tues night for a concert in croke park,have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. From reception staff to bar staff to breakfast staff they were extremely helpful and friendly.Really enjoyed my stay in this hotel.",5,2012,06,27
219,excellent location and value for money,"Stayed here on a friday for a concert in the o2 and it exceeded expectations. location was brilliant for the price (‚Ç¨80 a night) and very convenient for the train station and the Luas. room was lovely and we were upgraded to a suite, however i felt the space in the room could have been utilised better and furnishing changed around to make it a cosier room. residents area was a nice touch for a relaxing read of the paper or just to pan out. we got back late enough and asked for a recomendation for a near by take away. the man behind the desk gave us their own menu so i decided to get this. ordered a 12 inch pizza and 2 hot dogs and it all came to ‚Ç¨15 which was excellent and it was delivered to the room. food was delicious especially the pizza. parking isnt bad for a central hotel and only 7euro a day flat rate charge,",4,2012,06,14
219,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the North Star hotel for 3 nights during a convention we had to attend and I have to say that I was pleased with my stay there. The rooms were quite big and comfortable and were thoroughly cleaned. 
The hotel staff was very polite and helpful.

219,Convenient for everything,"Being only across the road from the train station and only 3-4 minutes walk from the bus station, it was so convenient to go anywhere in or out of Dublin and walking distance to most of Dublin's sites. Even the local Spar was next door. The hotel itself was very nice, the service was very good, the staff were friendly and the food was excellent. Our experience of the North Star Hotel was very good and we would recommend this hotel to anybody who wants the best of Dublin.",5,2012,06,12
219,Great for a city break,"We stayed here recently as we were going to see Tom Petty in the o2.  Very convenient location - literally across the road from Connolly station, which has a Luas connection to the o2 (or The Point) via Heuston station.  Hotel is 5 minutes walk from O'Connell street.  Room was well appointed (a wee bit tired, although it did seem a lot of the place was being refurbished).  Bed very comfortable, bathroom was ok.  Pub / restaurant again looked a bit tired, but the staff were lovely.  Food hit the spot and was good value.  Overall, a good place to stay for a short break in Dublin.",4,2012,06,09
219,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the North Star while going to see Tom Petty at the O2.  On arrival we were a little early but the staff offered to store our bags - very helpful.  We decided to camp out in the bar and do some work on the laptops - great coffee and tea at the bar - freshly made.  Barman was very good.  We then had a spot of lunch - which was great and checked in.  

Room absolutely great - clean and quiet.  Good aircon - bed very comfortable. Bagthroom spotless and modern. Internet good quality and fast. Tea coffee biscuits - Walkers - good quality.

We then booked a bus with the hotel to take us to the O2 - excellent service - cant fault it.  We came out and got picked up right back to the front door.  No fuss. Great service.

Breakfast was absolutely as good as its billed - no question.  Full Irish - perfect and the white puddings very yummy.  Actually its the best hotel brekkie I've had for a long time.  Service great - they had the right number of staff as well so we were well looked after even though it was pretty busy.

Gym modern and clean - although we didnt get to us it.

All in all a great hotel - staff very friendly and helpful but unobtrusive at the same time which I very much like.   Its also got a touch of Irish character which makes it more enjoyable from the usual Hilton Holiday Express blandness.  I very much enjoyed it and would recommend it.  Would I book again - yes absolutely - I just hope Tom Petty comes back soon as well!",5,2012,06,08
219,Perfect for city breaks!,"Really liked this hotel! It was great value for the room, we paid 80 euros for one night. The room was modern, comfy and clean! The bathroom was lovely too! The location was excellent as it is beside Connolly station so close to train, DART, Luas and Bus Aras. My one complaint is the price of the wi fi which was extortionate, these days a free wi fi service should be provided in accommodation in my opinion!",4,2012,06,07
219,A welcome smile in the morning!,"I found North Star on the internet.  Be careful of price comparison sites as it was cheaper, in the end, to book on the hotel's own website - even better value than ringing reception and making the booking directly, oddly!  Doing it over the web meant we got free internet and continental breakfast.

I sent some emails to the hotel in advance and they kindly replied, which was helpful.  The airport bus takes you within two minutes of the front door, at six euros.  But the hotel actually has its own bus service at five euros, which oddly it had not mentioned.

The hotel apparently has two classes of rooms.  Ours were a bit run down, although spacious and clean (apart from the windows - the outsides really need a seeing to!)  The breakfast was a bit limited in choice, but perfectly adequate.  In some hotels, ""continental"" includes cold meats and cheeses, but not here.  The head waitress was very welcoming, though, and made one feel very cheerful in the morning.  She had a lovely smile and was always very helpful - a credit to the hotel!

There is a well-equipped gym, which was empty whenever I went by.  There is also a small sauna, which is a nice facility.  

We ate in the bar one day and the food was tasty and of average price.  We did not try the restaurant.

The hotel is well position, next to Connolly Station and also on the tram line.  But you can walk in about 15 to 20 minutes to the main sights: Temple Bar; Trinity College; etc

A real bug bare is the price of leaving a bag on the last day: three euros per bag.  I would have marked the hotel higher if it had not been for this rather mean point.  I have never stayed anywhere else that did this.  Come off it!",3,2012,06,02
219,handy for an overnight visit,"Stayed here for one night for work purposes.  Staff were extremely helpful - as I had to leave early in the morning before breakfast was due to start, reception immediately offered to deliver a continental breakfast to my room at a time that suited me.  The room had been recently renovated,  and I found it clean, warm & comfortable.
A very convenient location for the city centre/o2/connolly station.  If I was to stay here again, I would request a room at the back of the hotel, as the hotel is directly on a very busy road.",3,2012,05,29
219,Great little spot!,"This is a great little hotel! A 5 minute walk to O'Connell St., and also right across from the Connolly train station. Location is ideal. There's nothing fancy about this hotel but the service is great, and the rooms are clean. A/C is also a bonus, although wifi isn't really worth the 11 euro/day. Would definitely stay there again though!",4,2012,05,29
219,Ideal for a short break,"First impressions of the front of the hotel were not appealing due to the peeling paintwork at the front, but the adage of not judging the book by its cover is definitely true of this hotel!

From the moment we booked in to the time of departure we were met with friendly and incredibly helpful staff - Angela deserves a special mention for outstanding customer service.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded for free to a Premier King room on the 7th floor, facing away from the railway station. The room was spacious and well decorated and not at all noisy.  Having a balcony and a patio door was a bonus especially becuase of the unseasonably hot weather we experienced.We were also able to use the facilities of the Premier Lounge, which offered a spacious sitting area, free water and hot beverages.  

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, where the prevailing attitude was one of ""no need to thank me, I'm just doing my job"".

My wife and I had a splendid stay and would heartily recommend the hotel. It is ideally located for transport links and is a 5 - 10 minute stroll to O'Connell Street

As a final bit of advice - book directly with the hotel as they offer free internet access and continental breakfast within their rates.",5,2012,05,29
219,Overnight base,We were on a flying visit to Dublin for the Heineken Cup Semi Finals so were only using the hotel as a place to lay our heads.  The hotel isn't in the best area of Dublin but is close to the bus station (we were getting an early bus the next morning) and a short walk from Temple Bar and a 20 minute walk from the Aviva Stadium.  I can't comment on the facilities but the room was perfect for our needs (ie a shower and a place to sleep).  One of my friends hates soft beds and found the beds a bit soft but I slept soundly (nothing to do with the consumed Guinness!),3,2012,05,27
219,Much better than expected!,"The North Star is a Hotel of two halves - the original building fronting onto Amiens Street, and a newer building behind this - separated by the railway line!

Commuter and DART trains to Connolly Station run from 06h00 to 23h00 approximately and if you're on the train side of the building this could be a problem, although I found the windows were very good sound insulators. 

I stayed in the ""old"" building which was in the process of being redecorated so a faint smell of paint in the hallways. My room was average size, but very clever use of space made it seem bigger. Lovely linens, plush carpet and a brand new bathroom were added bonuses. The bed is without doubt the most comfy hotel bed I've slept in for years. 

The location is steps away from Dublin's main rail and bus stations and an easy walk to O'Connell Street - slightly longer (15 minutes walk) to Grafton Street or Temple Bar. Handy for IFSC and many businesses if you're a business traveller. The area is busy and safe during the day.  In common with a lot of big cities, though, because it's so near the stations it can be a bit daunting at night with panhandling etc. My advice is if you go out to dinner, walk there and take a taxi back. 

Breakfast wasn't included in my room rate. It was tasty enough but not wow for the money - ‚Ç¨10.95 - you can do better, especially if you walk 10 minutes to Jury's Custom House Quay which is the best breakfast buffet I've found in Dublin. 

Overall a nice hotel - clean and friendly and value for money were the plus side. Minus side is there was no information on Internet access in the rooms and the location can be a bit ropey after dark for lone travellers. Oh - and the trains!",4,2012,05,19
219,Back after 28 years,"I first stayed at this hotel 28 years ago, but this time, now with family, my needs were quite different.   Happily, things have been updated since 1984, and although of course the price was a lot higher than back then I'd still feel we got good value for money.   The staff were all friendly and helpful, the breakfast was very good, and the room was clean.  The location was perfect for us, as we arrived at Connelly station, and the hotel is just across the street.  Some others have mentioned train noise, and it's certainly very evident at reception, however it was certainly not an issue in our room.  I must agree with one reviewer about the breakfast utensils being left in the heat and getting too hot to handle, as we found the same thing.  My only other negative comment was that they had a charge to leave baggage for a few hours after checkout and before we had to catch our flight, something offered as a courtesy at most hotels.  However we were certainly satisfied overall, and would likely stay again.",4,2012,05,11
219,"enjoyable hotel, unobtrusive staff","Perfect location, quiet place, clean, friendly and helpful staff",4,2012,05,11
219,Superb rooms! A find of a hotel!,"Stayed here with a colleague on Thursday night last - we checked in at 7pm and were greeted by a very friendly receptionist who was very helpful. The rooms we got we weren't expecting - incredibly modern, very spacious and with flat screen TVs and superb floor to ceiling windows which gave magnificent views over the city. Even better - we had access to the executive lounge on the 7th floor with tea, coffee and water - and better views again! The night porter even obliged us with 2 bottles of beer in the residents lounge after our return at 2am and couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast the next morning was great - exactly what was needed - lashings of ""full Irish"" and friendly staff. Came away very happy with our choice and would highly recommend.",5,2012,05,10
219,Disappointing,"We stayed here for 4 nights and were disappointed in our stay; we found 99% of the staff were morose. The room we had was, in our opinion, dated, the matresses like rocks. the tea/coffee quantities meagre. The breakfast presentation was not very appetising, the serving utensils were let in the heat and some were burning hot to the touch.
We did not use the restaurant preferring to eat out. We did use the bar and Paddy made us feel extremely welcome!!
We had travelled to celebrate a birthday and due to the attitude of a member of staff the start of this was ruined
Having stayed in many other hotels in Dublin,of a similar standard (* rating), we found this hotel to be a great disappointment",2,2012,05,09
219,smokey loos !!,"I found everything about the hotel was great, the breakfast was ample and delicious, the rooms where everything you'd require in a hotel, and the location was perfect, however there is one major problem which needs sorting , the ladies loos, on several occasions our party found people were smoking in them, and on one occasion there must have been several people smoking in them coz I couldn't stand it in there and came out stinking of the stuff, but overall I would definitely come back here again.",4,2012,05,07
219,A Gem of a hotel!,"We arrived to some news that the renovation work to the rooms had been delayed and the original rooms we had booked were not in a state to be let but they had an alternative for us. The alternative was fantastic & we negotiated free breakfast & everyone was happy.

We had tickets to a show at the O2 and this was a perfect location. 15 mins walk or the tram line was right outside with a single costing 1.60 euros. 

We also went out in Grafton Street which again was only 15-20 mins walk or 7 euro taxi. Main high street was closer at 5-10 mins. 

The rooms were clean, the beds was super comfy. The breakfast buffet was well stocked & very tasty. The food in the attached bar was good & with regular live music in the evenings. Fear not the music is not audible from the rooms, nor is the nearby train station. 

I plan to come back to the city to do some more exploring & I will definitely be stayin here!  Thanks to all the staff for being so friendly, efficient & helpful. X",5,2012,05,05
219,"Nice Hotel, Good Location","We got the bus from the airport then managed to find the hotel with our little tourist map fairly easily (3 girls!). On arrival we were greeted at reception and we thought the hotel looked really nice. We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. Our room was clean and equipt with everything we needed. The bed's were comfy and the shower was hot and powerful! The decor was probably in need of an update but that didn't effect our stay at all! The hotel was about a 5 minute walk from the spire on O'Connell street, so for us a good location as it wasn't loud or too busy but close enough to all the action!

We all loved Dublin and would defo stay at this hotel again!!",4,2012,05,04
219,Dublin hotel,"Normal hotel, average room, very good restaurant and servis. Pub was also very good.",3,2012,05,01
219,Better than expected,"I knew this place from previous visits to Dublin but had always opted to stay elsewhere because I didn't particularly like the neighbourhood, the exterior appearance of the hotel or the proximity to the railway line which runs VERRRY close by.
However my son-in-law booked it for us as an overnight stay to watch a rugby match and got a very good rate for a twin room with breakfast. I must say my reservations were largely dispelled; the hotel is actually much more modern and well provided than I expected and the full hot buffet breakfast was excellent. (It may have helped that the hotel was fully booked and therefore the food had to be replenished quickly and often).
The closeness to the railway was actually a bonus as we were able to go directly to the Aviva Stadium for the game without walking more a few 100 metres at each end. We did experience a little train noise whilst inside the hotel but had no real difficulties with it.
The North Star has all the advantages of a city centre hotel without many disadvantages (if you can disregard the very slightly dubious area common to many such establishments). I have stayed in hotels in large cities in England, France and Italy which were not nearly as good and have paid substantially more for the privilege.
Next time I'm going to insist that we book an executive suite !!",4,2012,04,30
219,Fantastic stay,"Excellent hotel, we stayed for my birthday weekend, great value for money, top brekkie and very helpful staff, i would definately stay here again. We were slighly concerned as previous reviews mentioned train noise but we were on the top floor and with windows closed the noise was fine, for what we got i am surprised at how little we payed for our room.",5,2012,04,30
219,Long time since I last stayed here but will not be as long again!,"This hotel (the premier club suites) has upgraded over the past couple of years and is now a very comfortable property. The king size bed was very comfortable and once I closed the window the room was noise free. As the hotel is beside the train station you would imagine (as in the past) that it would feel like trains were in the room but due to good double glazing, I heard absolutely nothing. The staff are very pleasant and were very attentive. A good property in the centre of the city.",4,2012,04,25
219,Mini Break in Dublin,"Excellent location opposite Connolly station and close to centre of Dublin, Spacious and clean  rooms, staff very friendly and really helpful. Good breakfast with plenty of choice. Landed around 8-30pm caught bus right outside airport to round corner from hotel. We checked in and went straight out to get some food. Most of the bars etc serve food till about 9-45. Lots to do and see in Dublin - we had 4 days and would go again.",4,2012,04,23
219,Perfect for a weekend.,"We stayed at the North Star in Dublin for the weekend, arriving quite late on the Friday evening. It is about 15 mins by taxi from the airport costing about 20 Euro's. The receptionist was very friendly and welcoming. The rooms were clean and spacious, the only slight niggle was that they had ashtrays in them and you could detect a slight aroma of stale smoke. We didn't mention this to the hotel and I'm sure if we had they would have tried to rectify it. The hotel had entertainment both Friday and Saturday evening which went on until at least midnight. which was good fun and seemed to be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. The bar staff probably could have been a bit frendlier. We only booked in for B & B but breakfast was just what we needed after a heavy day and night of sampling Dublins finest Guinness. There was a good buffet selection of a ""full Irish "" breakfast, plus cereals, toast and fresh fruits, Dining was a relaxed affair. The hotel is in a great location for Temple Bar where a lot of the day/nightlife takes place. Just a 10 minute walk, close enough to be near by but not in a really noisy location. I don't know if I would stay for a week but definitley recommend for a weekend.",4,2012,04,23
219,Ideal City Hotel!,"We booked this place off Booking.com and was absolutely ideal. We were in the city for a gig in the O2, so got the train up of a Friday afternoon from Cork, hopped on the Luas at Hueston and got off near Connelly Station and the hotel was straight across the road! We went to reception and got upgraded to suites, which was a nice start! The rooms were immaculate and bathrooms also with plenty supplies! The staff were immensely helpful and we would be repaying a visit here again if needed! Cost wise it is expensive but you can get good deals!",5,2012,04,18
219,Good Overall,"Our first trip to Ireland. Three options to get to the hotel from the airport; taxi, Paddywagon bus, and the local bus. We paid 10euro for a family bus pass. Taxi and Paddywagon were around 20 euro. Bus dropped us off less than a block away. We had 2 rooms and they were originally located on different floors. Hotel staff quickly worked on getting us the same floor. Rooms were clean and large compared to other European hotels.The hotel was located a short walk to several areas. We started our days early and ended them between 8pm and 11pm. Breakfast was good with plenty of choices. On the 4th floor the train was minimal with noise and didn't disturb sleep or conversation. There was an ATM and small store right around the corner. Paddywagon bus was used to get back to the aiport at 5am.",4,2012,04,18
219,Meh,"Room: clean, big
Amenities: tea & coffee making, TV
Bathroom: big, clean but poor, weak shower & useless shower curtain/screen
Local area: didn't feel the safest!
General decor: dated
Noise: loud",3,2012,04,17
219,V Good.,"Avoid the bar but apart from that great. Nice room and even a dinky wee fitness suite. We did not have breakfast (lots of shops nearby, saves on cost) and it has a central location. Sheriff St is dodgy but no tourist ought to head there anyhow.",4,2012,04,13
219,Bad first impression but room was nice,"We walked to the hotel after getting off the bus from the airport. We asked for directions from a local who told us 'to keep hold of our bags'. The area was rough, we didn't dare walk through there at night. First impressions of the hotel weren't good. We arrived at reception at 11:45am and was told that there were no rooms until 2pm and we were told to walk around the city. There was no apology and was no offer to sit in the hotel lounge. The lady who greeted us was rude. After finally getting to our room at 2pm, we stayed in the premier king double room; the room was lovely and modern. It was all super clean and better than we expected. We went to dinner in the McCoy's bar downstairs we found they had no burgers and no scones, bit of a let down. It was in a good location, in regards to being close to all the attractions and shops; as everything was in walking distance. I would recommend Dublin to anyone as we had a fantastic time and the Irish are friendly and helpful. ",4,2012,04,09
219,"Good hotel, good price, cool area.","The Good: 
We had a clean, big-for-Europe, no-smell room. We read how the trains could be loud, so we requested a room away from them, which we were given -- we didn't hear them at all. Breakfast was good every morning. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Nice location close to the DART and LUAS, and in good walking proximity to the major tourist sites south. Cool building. And, there's the James Joyce connection.

The Not-So-Good:
The safe in the room was broken (staff helped us out by storing our passports behind the desk). Also, TV got eight channels, and was too dim. Overall, didn't matter much. We weren't there to watch it, anyway. 

Overall:
A good hotel, at a great price. The good far outweighed the couple small things we had to complain about. Great staff. (Also, one note: In a few places we read about how staying north of the Liffey was dangerous, scary, risky, etc. We didn't find this to be the case at all. We didn't have any problems, and didn't once feel unsafe, though of course we didn't wander down any alleys or have money hanging out of our pockets. In fact, we liked the north of the city as much, if not better, than the touristy south. It's a cool, redeveloped area, and you're only about a 10-15 minute walk from all the big sites.)",4,2012,04,07

219,Good location,"This hotel is in a really good location for a city visit - its very close to Bus Aras and Connolly Station and about a ten minute walk from Henry Street. Staff are very friendly and our room was lovely, very modern and clean. Theres a little bit of noise/vibration from the nearby train station - we were on the first floor but didnt bother us at all, in fact after the first few times we barely noticed it.",4,2012,04,03
219,Pleasantly surprised.,"It was our first visit to Ireland, and considering that we really knew nothing about the surrounding areas of Dublin we researched several different hotels to stay at. We finally decided on the North Star, largely because of all the other ""affordable"" hotels were far from the center of the city. We stayed there from 3/13-3/20. 

If you're looking to be wowed then I suggest that you book somewhere else. It was a reasonably priced, quaint hotel. The staff are very pleasant (yet not that knowledgeable about Dublin), rooms were decent size, and the pub was fun, late night hang-out spot. We did not order any room service, nor eat at their restaurant so I do not have any opinions at those amenities. The bed, I must say, was huge and extremely comfortable.The temperature of the room was terrible. It was hot each night in the room so you'll most likely have to sleep with a window or sliding door open. The rooms have thermostats, but they did not do much. To be fair, their website explains that some rooms do not have air conditioning, but we stayed ""on the newer side"" that were suppose to have them. If you get too hung over, and expect to lay in bed channel surfing all day, well you'll be extremely disappointed. There are 9 channels to view, and it was some of the most drab television I've ever watched, but you're on vacation why are you spending so much time watching tv anyway?

At all costs you should book directly from their website. That way you'll get the Wi-Fi included. Otherwise, Wi-Fi capabilities are like 10.95 Euro per day, and their Wi-Fi is not state of the art by any stretch of the imagination. If you rent a car you will need to pay per day for the lot. It was not too bad...something like 8-10 Euro per day. Also, in my opinion, when you reserve your room do not opt for the ""Irish Breakfast"" extra meal package. I thought it was terrible. I was pleasantly surprised about food, in general in Dublin we did not have one bad meal; however, the ""buffet"" style breakfast was lackluster. 

The other major thing to know evidently the North Star Hotel is located in a ""seedy section"" of Dublin 1. We did not know this prior to booking the hotel. Now having said that we were informed that the area was unpredictable by every cab driver that drove us back late at night. We did not have any issues for what it's worth, but just exercise precaution when walking back at night. They have staff available at all hours after they lock up for the night, and they were also very nice.",4,2012,03,29
219,Dublin Darts Trip 2012,"Hotel was supposed to have been refurbished I believe - not our rooms - quite excited when it said on door ""Executive Suite"" - well this just meant 2 large beds in 1 room - another funny shaped room - another small room for clothes - really tiny bathroom, dogdy stains on carpets - paid less than ¬£10 more to stay in Hilton Hotel  Belfast on way home - now this was quality - afraid would not rebook North Star again!!",3,2012,03,27
219,Cheap & cheerful...good location for Dublin city centre & sightseeing,"I chose this hotel based on location to Dublin city centre, Temple Bar and also due to the price.
On arrival, I realised by chance that I had previously stayed at the same hotel. 
The standard double room we had was basic but clean and catered for our needs. We were facing out towards the rail line although I don't feel the noise of the trains passing was of any problem to us at all. The trains don't run through the night so it's nice and quiet when it needs to be.
The hotel location is great as only about a 7 minute walk to O'Connell Street (the main street) and 12-15mins to Temple Bar. The only thing I would say is that the walk back to the hotel late at night wouldn't be something I'd be too keen to do regularly. The area isn't bad...just as a little quieter and without really knowing the area, I would imagine the unfortunate person might on occasion come face to face with a couple of the old drunks in the area. Assuming you're not on your own though, I wouldn't be too fussed.
The hotel runs shuttle buses called Paddywagons regularly to and from the airport (from right outside the hotel) for 5 Euros per head which was pretty reasonable and cheaper than a taxi etc.
Overall I would say a good relatively cheap and cheerful location for a few days in Dublin city.",3,2012,03,25
219,Not what we expected,"We booked a premier suite,we have had larger bedrooms! I emailed the hotel in advance of our arrival after reading other travellers advice and requested a room at the back of the hotel away from the train lines, we were still given a room overlooking the trainlines! After requesting a change of room, we were moved the following day to the 7th floor in a room on the corner of the hotel where all you could here were trains!
Other problems. The executive lounge sounds great, but it was never stocked up. The only time any newspapers appeared, was when i actually emailed the manager and  complained, that there were no newspapers/magazines in there!
I also complained as we had no movie channel, this is an extra clearly advertised when you book a suite. We were told some blarney about a chap working on it etc etc sad thing was, we don't have a tv at home, it's one of our treats when we go away to watch a film but this facility was never available.
The decor throughout was old and desperately in need of a cleam.
On the positive side the bed was so comfy it was unbelieveable. The manager Victor is lovely and did have a chat to us regarding my complaint but this is not a hotel we would be recommending as it was not worth the mobey we paid.",2,2012,03,24

219,St. Patricks weekend 2012,Had a great weekend sty in the hotel over St. Patrick's weekend. Had stayed there a few years before and the hotel has had a bit of a makeover since then which has been a great improvement. Reception were excellent and were always willing to help.,4,2012,03,21

219,"Great Location, Modern & Value for Money","Thank you North Star for my comfortable visit whilst in Dublin. I stayed in North Star for business due to its close proximity to O¬¥Connell Street & Temple Bar only a 5 minute leisurely walk away. O¬¥Connell train station is also opposite the hotel ideal for guests looking to do day trips around Ireland.  The hotel is modern with a traditional Irish pub offering guests the best of both worlds. The rooms were well furnished with extremely comfy beds that I found hard to leave!  The normal hairdryers in the room offers a nice personal touch and makes a change from the basic powerless hairdryers normally found. The breakfast room offers a variety of options suitable for all tastes, during my visit I also managed to use the gym which has everything that a sports enthusiast would need. Staff we also very welcoming and friendly. Overall this hotel offers value for money and has a superb location to go with it.",5,2012,03,12
219,good hotel,"Nice location,in the centre of city,close to major train station and Luas (tram ),local shop just round the corner .You can park your car ( ‚Ç¨7 per 24h) in the back.
Room was clean,warm,not noisy.
The staff v.helpful.
Restaurant and bar ok,good pints :)",4,2012,03,11
219,uncomfortable stay,"On arrival to the hotel myself and my friend went to reception it looked nice and modern and there was a woman at the desk she was Irish and she had a bad manner very rude. Went up to the room and everything appeared nice until later on. We went out for dinner and when we came back the room was like a furnace it was terrible heat and we had the air con turned on the coldest setting. I had no choice but open the balcony doors and leave them open all night. At around 3am a train went by and woke me up this happened all through the early hours of the morning. 
This was surprising to me as I had booked a premier room on the 7th floor, you would think that if im paying a great deal of money then I should expect a quiet room. The beds were very nice and soft and room was clean. There is a major problem with the heat so be warned. 
The bathroom was very small and the rainforest shower was ok ish. 
I get the impression that the staff are unfriendly only one of the receptionists was nice I think she was hungarian. Breakfast was nice self service. 
So would I Stay here again probably not as I feel I did not get value for money and the over heated sauna room was a major offput.",1,2012,03,08
219,Good value for money.,"Bit concerned after reading other reviews but had a lovely stay. Booked one of the premier rooms room excellent with a  very large comfy bed. No noise from trains and very central for main streets etc. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food excellent esp breakfast, would def stay again.",4,2012,03,06
219,Excellent,"Had stayed here this weekend. Can't say anything bad, just the rooms are not what you book online.The owner need to think more about room refreshing, looks very oldstylish and not very clean, not worth the money what you are paying.I heard that the Premiere rooms are very nice and competitive the price.
The breakfast was great, staff is amazing. Looks like they need to deal often with guest complains, so they do their best to make customer stay satisfied. Thanks for directions to Dublin restaurants and places to visit. Manager on duty , Victor, professional and girl at the reception, long hair beauty, made our stay  with good memories. Will be back but next time choose Premiere rooms.",5,2012,03,04
219,Nothing Special,I stayed here for a weekend away with my friends. The rooms are basic and bathrooms are small. The price was cheap. The hotel is around 20 minutes walk away from the Temple Bar area and around a 10 minute stroll from the shops. Breakfast wasnt anything special.,3,2012,03,02
219,"Fantastic hotel , excellant service , very welcoming","I had a fantastic stay at the North Star hotel, My premier room was amazing , just like a 5 star standard.  I found the staff and service second to none and will definitely return , I am very shocked at the lanquage used by recent reviewers , this was not my experience at all",5,2012,03,01
219,Fantastical stay and great service,"I stayed at this hotel over the weekend just gone; I was travelling alone and did not know the area very well. But this was not a problem! The staff looked after me so well. The hotel was really easy to find. Check-in was great. Staff at reception was very nice and explain everything about the hotel and near areas on check-in. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast on the Sunday was busy, but no problems there and the breakfast was perfect. The rooms are really clean and great. It's a really spacious hotel. All I can say is book this hotel and give it a go. Staff and Manager on Duty was fantastic and so helpful. 

Whenever business or pleasure brings back me in Dublin again, I will book North Star again. I can't say enough good things about the property or it's management and team. 

Thank you North Star and see you soon.",5,2012,03,01
219,Excellent stay.....great.......,"My partner and I stayed here last weekend for an anniversary treat in one of the premier room. We checked in on Saturday afternoon. Staff were great and very helpful at all time.Room was very nice, clean, well maintained and nicely furnished. We had booked the Sauna for the evening, which was great experience,  We had a dinner in the Bianconi Restaurant. Food was so Delicious it was not expressed in words . Again the staff were great and we really enjoyed the evening. 
The breakfast the next morning was fairly usual, cereals, fry etc but did have some nice touches like Juices etc.. 
Overall it was a fantastic stay and he really really enjoyed our time.
Keep it up all good work.",5,2012,03,01
219,Average you pay for what you get,"Central hotel within easy of city centre walking distance, the rooms are basic and acceptable and clean. Bathrooms need an update and shower was poor all in bathrooms my family stayed, staff helpful and breakfast was good although served in the basement? Overall ok wouldn't stop here again unless bathrooms refurbished.",3,2012,02,28
219,VILE!!!,"My friend and i went for a night away, when we got to the hotel reception was very nice and welcoming we thought it was really nice untill we walked into the room, very tired looking and dirty the bathroom was very old and ntohing like the pictures on the website.
i went and complained and the snotty asian manager was rude and tired tellin us we was wrong and thought his rooms were acceptable, so we had to pay ‚Ç¨20 euro to upgrade to a premier room. when we got to the room thought it was really nice but realised the kingsize bed was two singles put together wasnt assuming to be frank as we paid about ‚Ç¨90 and the breakfast room was stocking for the state of the hotel, i wouldnt advise anyone to stay at this hotel as it isnt what it says on the internet! other than that dublin is a very beautiful city.",1,2012,02,22
219,"Clean, large, affordable room and friendly staff","I recently surprised my girlfriend to a three night trip to Dublin and we were very impressed by this hotel. We found our premier room to be clean and modernly fitted with a large extremely comfortable bed and well fitted bathroom. On arrival we had been concerned by comments by the taxi driver about the location of the hotel being a bit rough, but our experience found these comments to be unfounded. The hotel is very close to the train tracks, but we didn't notice any noise. The hotel is located just a 5-10 minute walk to O'Connell Street and proved an ideal base for our sight seeing adventures. The staff were very polite and friendly. We both agree that we would definitely stay at this hotel again as it offers great value for money.",4,2012,02,22
219,Poor,"The hotel is very tired looking. Our first room was dirty and the fixtures in the bathroom were falling apart. We were moved to what we were told was an Executive Suite!!!! This room was at least clean but again the fittings were all very shabby.
The plus side - good guys in the bar and a good pint",2,2012,02,18
219,"Good hotel, though close to train line","Good value hotel, though the train track runs close, they can be heard from rooms on front of hotel, premier rooms are excellent and staff are friendly, though towels could do with being bigger!",4,2012,02,18
219,Good choice for budget stay in Dublin,"I stayed at this property for 4 nights in late December 2011.  The room was surprisingly large and the bed was very comfortable.  Fantastic Irish breakfast each morning.  When I first asked about WiFi, I was told there was a (fairly steep) charge but I was then told that because I booked the room through the hotel website that the WiFi was free.  I guess that also applied to the breakfast.  Despite the proximity of Connelly St. train station across the street and tracks which run next to (and appear to run through) the hotel, I never heard any train noise inside the hotel.  A pub and restaurant are also on site.  Short walk to most of the tourist areas of Dublin (15-20 minutes)",4,2012,01,28
219,Highly recommend; excellent hotel,"A hidden gem.  Ideally located directly across from Connolly station and around the corner from the Luas stop.  A 5-minute stroll and you're on O'Connell Street.  We were upgraded to a suite when we arrived:-)   Clean & comfortable.  Parking is ‚Ç¨7 per 24-hours.  Staff were so friendly and helpful (apart from the concierge who would put you off asking a question with the cross look on his face!!).  

Food was absolutely fabulous; we had dinner in the restaurant and would highly recommend.  Good wine menu too.  Breakfast was great; supplies refreshed frequently so no congealed food on show!  Lovely hot fresh toast.  Overall a great stay.",5,2012,01,24
219,so accessible,"just back from a weekend break at this hotel....hotel was well placed for the O2, about a 6 min walk, everything else within walking distance, food was excellent, housekeeping very friendly as was the concierge and other staff, would recommend this hotel highly.",5,2012,01,23
219,V.good just needs a paint job,"the room which me and my wife got was second to none and really clean, the bar down stairs is ok but needs a good revamp painting ..ect...the staff were nice and friendly but didn,t see any local people at all working in it which to me was strange,we went to the snowpatrol concert which was at least 35 mins from the hotel they tell you 10mins on their website  to the o2 arena,if your getting a bus its handy as its round the corner just,all in all would go back again",4,2012,01,23
219,Wouldn't stay again,"We booked into this hotel for 2 nights last weekend, as we were going to a concert at the O2 arena. We are in our late 20's and aren't that fussy, having travelled around the world. 

However when we arrived at hotel, as we travelled by car, the car park charges 8 euros a day for parking, but you have to leave your keys with them as it's a tiny car park. didnt read this on hotel website. We were not happy doing so, as the man in car park could've been anybody at all as gates lie open.

We ended up being directed to the train station car park which is located at the very bottom of a long street opposite the hotel, which is pay and display, would not want to do this walk at night. Bring cases with wheels also, or you will do yourself an injury.

When we got booked in, we were given a room on the 3rd floor, one double bed and one single bed. The double bed covers where stained and the bed itself looked like it had big holes in the mattress. The side of the bath in bathroom was broken. The room itself was like a time warp back to the 80's and there was an over powering smell of stale smoke, and several cigarette burns in the carpet. I suffer from asthma and the stale smoke is not acceptable. We rang reception and they offered us an alternative room on the 3rd floor. This room was almost identical, only smelling of smoke less than the first. We also noticed plug in air fresheners in the corridor, so they obviously have alot of smoking residents.

As a last resort we asked about the posibility of any room upgrades. We were offered a suite at 50 euros a night on top of the initial room fee. We decided to take the suite. This was like a totally different hotel, very modern, and clean. The spring closure on the room door was hanging off and hitting the wall behind, the air con was stuck on hot, and couldnt be turned down, we just turned it off, and the plug hole in one of the bathroom sinks was broken. Apart from that I could not fault the room. The bed was ultra comfy, best hotel bed i've ever slept in.

Breakfast was fine, rice crispies, cornflakes, weetabix of museli. Toast brought to your table, selection of fruit and yoghurts, and irish cooked breakfast. Tea or coffee, water or orange juice. The only thing I would say was on our second morning a member staff pushed in infront of me to fill up the orange juice container, only to see he was diluting it with water. Could tell by the taste too.

The night of our concert the hotel had a return shuttle bus laid on for the concert, 7.50 euros a head.  This was handy. However the room next door seemed to be having a party when we got back. Another thing is the hotel is built around a railway track and our suite was about 20 metres from the track. Luckily the glass walls seem to almost cut out the sound in full, but it's loud if you open the door.

The premier lounge on the 7th floor, has lots of seating and tables, a big flat screen tv a coffee, tea and hot chocolate machine, bottles of water and a selection of biscuits. Thats it.

Overall not impressed by the hotel, would not recommend it.",1,2012,01,23
219,Only stay if you are checking out early,"Ok hotel, very handy for o2 chambermaids came into room 4 times between 10 and 12 to clear room- not on ",3,2012,01,22
219,A Good Find,"We'd come from Shannon and ended up in Dublin overnight unexpectedly as Sail/Rail was cancelled due to bad weather. We just wandered in and for 79 euro, including wifi, we decided to stay. Room was clean, modern and spacious with tea & coffee making facilities. The areas of the hotel we saw were clean, well-maintained, and had security card system. Front desk staff were helpful and assisted me in printing some plane reservations. Breakfast was available at an extra 9.90 euros, but we didn't try it as we were leaving early. Hotel is opposite Connolly Station, a very short walk from main bus station, and extremely close to local tram/train/buses. Walking through the hotel you can hear the rumble of the trains, but couldn't hear a thing from our room (first floor). There is a guest lounge with computer/printer/vending machines, and a bar and restaurant, plus reasonably priced room service. We were there on a public holiday night, so some nearby food outlets closed early. No complaints, I thought we'd be traipsing around Dublin for hours looking for a reasonably priced hotel. On our last visit to Dublin (2008) we had a double room in a hostel which cost almost the same amount. Would stay here again!",4,2012,01,22
219,ENJOYABLE STAY,"stayed here for just one night while going to a show at nearby GrandCanal-The Location is excellent,ie across the road from Connolly Station.We arrived quite early but there was no problem with checking in early,.The hotel room itself was very clean,lots of hot water,comfortable bed and a tasty breakfast.Nothing was any bother for the very helpful reception staff and the cocierge helpful again with directions etc.
We enjoyed our stay even though it was only for the night ,but based on its location and it being a pleasant experience we will most definitely return
Recommended..",4,2012,01,20
219,Well worth a visit,"Just stayed a couple of nights and can only say it was more than I expected. Clean, friendly,good breakfast, excellent location, and nice bar on ground floor. Would recommend it to anyone travelling to Dublin. Also has a small gym/sauna on the ground floor which I will use when I return.",4,2012,01,20
219,decent inside but extremely close to train station,"although when we booked we weren't told exactly how close the hotel is to the  train station (basically attached) the hotel itself is quite nice inside for a 3* and suits well as a cheap hotel for a short break.  We arrived extremely early, from a 6am flight for a 2 o'clock check in but managed to get given a room so could recoup and have a couple of hours rest which was a god positive touch to start our stay.
The closeness to the DART is a positive aspect and it isn't that noisy throughout the night but if you require a daytime nap it might be an issue. The city centre is only a 5-10 and a lot of attractions are easy to get to due to brilliant (and better value than UK prices) links all over the city",4,2012,01,11
219,Well situated,"We stayed in the hotel just before Christmas, however we had originally booked into the Regency Airport Hotel (which would have been our fourth visit) I received a phone call on the day of arrival as we were waiting for a flight from dublin to nice, to say that they couldn't accommodate us, due to a flu oubreak. We were given the choice of being refunded or moved to their sister hotel-the North Star, we chose the latter as we were just about to get on the plane. The North star hotel was ok, it is well situated and there is an airport shuttle, staff very helpful and friendly but the Wifi was not free for hotel residents wheras at the Regency it is free if you book online which we had done. Overall we would have preferred the Regency Airport Hotel  and did miss especially the swimming pool!",3,2012,01,07
219,new year,i have stayed in this hotel every year and can not praise it enough from the great staff to its location stayed in the premier suite which was great a lovely soft bed which i dint want to get out of enjoyed the music at the weekend i can cant wait to next year keep up the good work,5,2012,01,06
219,Good for a city break,"The hotel is very close to O' Connell Street and we walked to every tourist attraction. Nearby were supermarkets in case we needed water or a snack. The room was clean, but we didn't like the mattress which was too soft. The reception staff was very helpful. We didn't enjoy that much the Irish breakfast (maybe is a matter of taste). Because we had to check out very early in the morning, we ordered the continental breakfast in our room, which was delivered in time. Also, the bus/airport shuttle station was very close.",3,2011,12,28
219,Perfect for the O2,"Location very good for Dublin city centre, and for the O2.  Nice bar, more like a friendly Dublin pub than a hotel bar, staff very friendly and helpful.  Room was nice, could have been a little bigger perhaps, but clean and everything worked!  Very good value overall, breakfast was fine too

l",4,2011,12,17
219,Friendly Staff,"Stayed here for my birthday in november with my partner. The location to centre of town wasn't too far and there is a shuttle to and from the airport. The room was very nice, plasma tv, quite large room, nice decor throughout hotel. Really nice and helpful staff. Stayed in a Club Suite so had access to premier lounge and breakfast room on top floor.",4,2011,12,16
219,Good value,Nothing bad to say really about this hotel. Was on business in the IFSC and stayed one night. Clean tidy very big room. Staff very friendly. Clark park attendant very helpful. The hotel is very close to O Connell Street and lots of other tourist destinations. Di not eat there so not comment on food. The only down side really is if I was staying with my kids the showers I are not thermostatically operated and could possibly lead to someone being scalded. I work in this area and found it difficult to get the water regulated to an acceptable heat.,4,2011,12,01
219,Great Stay in ole Dublin town,"My friend and I recently spent two nights at the North Star.  Dublin can be a bit daunting with the amount of b and b's and hotels.  A friend recommended North Star.  It is located directly across from the train station, and has easy access to Dublin City Centre, including great walking adventures, good restaurants and pubs.  Temple Bar area is a wee walk away.   As for the hotel,
it is fabulously clean, and has some amazing new suites upstairs.  We stayed in the older portion and it was comfortable and clean.  If you book directly on their site, you can get free wifi and breakfast included.   Now, best of all:  the people.  From the maids, the kitchen crew, to the concierge, and every person at reception and on board were wonderfully kind and helpful.  I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2011,11,30
219,B and B,"Pleasant staff, nice room but warm at night as air conditioning did not seem very effective.  Would not recommend McCoys bar next door for food but craic seemed good at night when band playing.  Good location as hotel just five minute walk to city centre.",4,2011,11,28
219,Too many disappointments,"I had high hopes for this hotel after reading some very positive reviews, so I thought it would make the perfect spot for my wife and I to spend our first night away alone since our child was born 2 years ago. I booked the Premier suite to make it a bit more special. 
We got there at around 7pm on the Friday evening for our one night stay. When we got to the hotel we were met with our first disappointment. The car park was closed. We were told that we could use the car park across the road at the train station, but to do that, our car would be locked inside an unmanned outdoor car park over night. We needed access to our car, so our only other option was to park in the city centre, which was a 20 min walk away.
When we finally got to the hotel, I tried a little banter with the receptionist, saying ""I cant wait to sit down. Had to park in the city centre and walk over"" Didnt get so much as a grunt. All I got was...""sign here please"" and ""you booked the pre pay rate so full payment is required"" We got our directions to the room, which was on the 7th floor. We were optimistic when we saw that the lift labelled the 7th floor as the ""Premier Suites and Premier Lounge"" 
Next disappointment...the Premier Lounge was closed. Oh well, at least we have a ""premier suite"" We opened the door to find....a nice hotel room. Same as any other nice hotel room really. The bathroom was nicely decorated, but was quite dark and smaller than I thought it would be. The ""Rainforest Shower"" was a large shower head in a bath...nothing special and the water pressure wasnt the best. The towels, hardly what you'd expect in a suite. Small and thin. There was shower gel, soap and shampoo in large plunger bottles which only made me think that the hotel didnt worry about small touches. 
The room itself, as I said, it was nice, and it had a small balcony which was a nice surprise. The TV was the biggest luxury. A 32inch flat screen with a decent selection of channels. Movies were extra but not badly priced and a big selection. Not something I'd use myself, but a good addition none the less and worth a mention. The room itself though was no bigger than any other normal nice hotel room I've been in.There were the usual things you'd expect. Tea/ Coffee, iron. And as advertised...Air con. I was happy to see the air con control panel because the room was very warm. We decided to change for dinner and head out leaving the air con on to cool the room. We got back late in the night and walked into a sauna. I checked the air con and it was at its coldest setting, but was pumping out hot air. Since it was so late, we decided to just turn it off and sleep on top of the bed rather than under the sheets. The bed was large and comfortable, but the heat in the room meant neither of us slept well.
Our booking included a continetal breakfast. We sat down and a girl took our order for tea or coffee. We grabbed some fruit and juice each while waiting for tea. There was nothing else to choose from other than the fried food. No bread rolls or cold cut selections which I would expect with a continental breakfast. Our tea....never arrived. Staff seemed unconcerned, so we just decided not to bother and left to prepare to check out. 
Not wanting an argument to spoil our time, I politely informed the receptionist about the air con. Before I even finished explaining the problem, she interrupted and said ""we know, the air con is giving alot of trouble. We're working on it!"" I asked why I wasnt informed this when checking in and she turned away from me. Apparently pre paying means you are no longer considered a customer as long as your keys are handed over.
So to summarise... The hotel itself is nice, but barely worthy of 3 stars. If you plan to stay, do not plan to park there unless you arrive very early. If you want a premier suite....go somewhere else. The definition of a suite here is broken air con and a large bed with flat screen tv. 
The staff, they couldnt even be described as rude, because they didnt care enough to engage in conversation. 
All I can say to the hotel is thank you for making us realise that if you want an enjoyable night away, spend the extra money if you want quality.",2,2011,11,27
219,very friendly staff stayed nov 18-20th 2011 wag n suzy langholm,stayed last weekend had an absolutely brilliant time hotel very clean rooms were immaculate and staff very friendly. went for breakfast (full irish) on sat morning and kept me full till night time would recommend this hotel even to the mother-in-law. They gave us complimentary upgrade on arrival,4,2011,11,21
219,disgrace - like stepping back in time,"I stayed in the this hotel last weekend, with my husband - It was booked on lastminute.com as a secret hotel and was delighted when this hotel came up.
However when we got to our room - i found it very small, very fusty and dated - we booked under room only, also to have a train going past your bedroom every few minutes wasnt really what i would have called a relaxing weekend. I overlooked that anyway - the 1st morning the water for the shower was abs freezing, my husband rang reception and they said they would send a maintenance man up (what could he/she have done). Anyway never showed, so a cold shower was had. Next morning was exactly the same. Friends who were in the neighbouring room rang reception who advised that because it was a later part of the morning we would have been better having a shower earlier. A hotel of this size should have hot water morning, noon & night and should cater for people wanting a shower as & when they want.
The manager on duty said we could have complimentary breakfast. But it was too little too late. This was a hotel i had high expectations of - the front part of the hotel seriously needs some re-decoration. I dont know what the back part of the hotel is like - but it seems to be more modern.  As much as I loved Dublin last weekend I definitely would not recomment this hotel - unless you like compact bedrooms & cold showers.",2,2011,11,19
219,recent vacation,"We've been coming to this Hotel for the last 4yrs. We can honestly say we've had a very pleasurable experience every single time. The 1st yr we stayed on the 2nd floor & lucky for us we were nowhere near the train track that runs at the bk of the hotel. The last 3 times we've stayed in the premier suites which is luxury. Any problems we had this time was rectified immediately. The staff are very friendly, curtious, helpful & keen. Cleanliness is key. Food delicious. Reliable lifts. Facing the hotel is the Railway Station, around the corner is the Bus Station, & the Bus from the Airport is directly outside departures travels every 15 mins & costs 6 Euros each estimated time on bus to this hotel is approx 30mins",5,2011,11,16
219,Lovely Staff,"We stayed here from 22nd Sept until 25th Sept. When we arrived we were allocated a non smoking room, we asked if we could be moved and they did so without a bother, the staff were very helpful and friendly, couldnt have asked for any better really, the room was clean and cleaned every morning. We ate in the breakfast room, McCoys bar and the restaurant and it was all really nice. I will definately be back again and I will definately be reccomending the hotel.",5,2011,11,09
219,Will be staying again,"We travel to Ireland a lot and have never been so pleased with a hotel as we were with The North Star, everything about it was excellent. The room was perfect, the biggest and comfiest bed ever! Bathroom was very posh with an amazing shower. Ideal location if you are wanting Dublin City Centre, a 10 minute walk to the main Temple Bar, 5 mins to the shops and River Liffey and when you'd rather not walk it is directly facing a taxi rank. Room and hotel were kept immaculate, really enjoyed our stay!!! We had a Premier King Club Room with a balcony, the trains running past were a little annoying but completely bareable and would not put us off staying again.",5,2011,11,08
219,Wonderful Trip to Ireland!,"We picked the North Star Hotel Premier Suites for our lodging on our first trip to Ireland. It was a wonderful experience-from the moment we arrived the staff was so accommodating and friendly. We arrived early in the morning, so our room wasn't ready , but they checked in our luggage and recommended a nice pub across the street for breakfast while we waited for our room. Our room was very nice and comfortable, very clean and the king size bed was so comfortable-we slept great every night! The staff was very nice and gave us recommendations about what to do -the concierge was very friendly and gave us a lot of good tips-the Pub down in the lobby was convenient-though the food wasn't very good-but the Guinness was delicious! Hotel's location a bit off the beaten path, but a quick walk to Oconnell Street and close to public transportation. The area was a little shady at night, but we never felt unsafe, and there were always other tourists walking around-we would stay here again-it's an older hotel, with a new section, where we stayed and the older lobby held a lot of charm-we would recommend this hotel for it's cleanliness, friendliness and convenience to all of Dublin's attractions.",5,2011,11,07
219,Good hotel with minor flaws,"Stayed in the hotel from 1st - 4th Nov 2011 in the Premier Suites. 

The Premier rooms are very nice inside, the king bed was huge & comfortable. The room was very hot but the aircon sorted that out. Our room had a balcony overlooking the train tracks but it wasn't to noisy. The slabbing work on the balcony doesn't look safe though, it's only been placed there & not set. 

There was a bad flood in Dublin the week prior to our arrival, this may have caused a bad smell to appear from the air vent in our bathroom, this would come & go. 

The gym & sauna was also closed during our stay due to the floods, I know this is no fault of the staffs but this was a factor in us booking this hotel & we were not made aware it was closed until I had gone into town & purchased gym trainers & asked to book the Sauna & gym. Staff could have told us at check in the gym & sauna were shut. 

The Premier Club lounge on the 7th floor is very nice & has a free coffee machine (although it ran out on our 2nd day of some coffee) & a collection of magazines & complimentary bottled water. 

The bar attached to the pub was ok, seats need replacing as their all ripped but it was nice enough. 

In conclusion, our room was really nice, we enjoyed the hotel, but it would have been better had the gym been open & the weird smell circulating in the air vents been cleared. 

I wouldn't rule out using the hotel again as I feel the problems were only minor. ",4,2011,11,07
219,Excellent stay...Premier Club Rooms won't be beaten for quality / price,"Stayed here with wife and other family for 3 nights in October / November.  We wanted something affordable, convenient, comfortable and quiet as my wife was running the marathon.  I can only speak for the Premier Club Rooms - which are not much more expensive than the standard rooms - but they were fantastic and as good a quality as you will find in a four star hotel (the North Star is listed as 3 star).  

On the top floor - with own balcony overlooking Connolly Station the rooms were immaculate.  To add to the value - we also had access to the Premier Club Lounge (on the same floor), which was great to relax and chill with the rest of the family.

We also ate in the bar and the food was good...and reasonably priced.

I had read some bad reports about this hotel - but honestly I cannot fault it.  I will definitely stay here again...",5,2011,11,05
219,Nice Stay,Stayed in this hotel as I was attending a concert in the O2. Hotel is nice.Reception area is very modern. They Had a shuttle bus to the O2 which was ‚Ç¨7 each return. Hotel is perfect if you are just looking for a one night stay. Only thing I didn't like was the parking.,3,2011,10,31
219,"Helpful friendly staff, quality clean room. Food very reasonably priced in McCoys.","This hotel was about 10 mins walk to O connell street.  It was opposite Dublin,s Heuston train station.  We stayed in the back bedrooms which was very quiet and peaceful.  Our room had a balcony which was a blessing because the rooms and hotel was very warm.  The bed was extremely comfortable the room was modern and well equipped. I cannot fault this hotel!",4,2011,10,31
219,Really Good and Very friendly and helpful staff :),"Stayed here on the 25th October 2011. I was goin to Lee Evans concert in the o2 arena. On arrival to the hotel me and my boyfriend noticed there was a problem with the hotels electric. The floods and terrible weather had affected the electricity to the hotel and they had a power cut. 

This did not bother us as we understood that this was not the hotels fault. The staff were trying there best to accommodate people people on arrival. While we were waiting the staff offered us complimentary drinks. Very much appreciated :)

The room was different to the one we booked but this was not a problem. The room was over looking to the train but we did not mind. The room was really nice and was very spacious. 
The beds were very comfortable.  We also had breakfast the next morning and this was quite delicious.

The shuttle bus to the o2 was a great help and was not over priced. When we got back from the concert we were abit hungry and ordered food at reception and they then brought the food up to our room which was great.
  
Overall we really enjoyed our stay and we would definitely be back again if we are up for another concert :)",5,2011,10,26
219,Well worth it - good hotel,"We stayed from Friday to Monday and found it ideal. The staff were very helpful, the place was smart and tidy, the decor was in good order, not tired and you got the feeling that the management took pride in the presentation.

It seemed to me to be hot in general throughout the place but maybe that was simply because the ambient temperature was warmer than you might have expected for the time of year and they've fired up their heating. Easily cured by turning off the radiator in our room. Better too warm than too cold though!

Some reviews mention that noise might be an issue. Our room was directly over the bar and looked out over Amiens St. at Connolly station. We could hear the music in the bar when we stopped off in the room to get changed, as well as the traffic and the occasional train, but since we never got to bed before the band and the trains had finished it wasn't an issue for us.

It's about a 10 minute walk down Talbot Street to O'Connell Street, which is more or less the middle of town. It's just across the Lifffey from there to Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, etc. If you don't want to walk you can catch the tram into the city centre from very close to the hotel, or a bus, if you can work out what goes where. The aforementioned Connolly station right across the road from the hotel gives you ready access to the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) if you want to go up or the down coast a little, to Howth say. Very handy.

Breakfast was very good - the hotel obviously caters for large numbers as you can tell in the breakfast room, but the hot food was all nicely done and with its help-yourself buffet style you could eat as much as you liked, so we did, setting ourselves up for lots of touring around without the need to waste valuable drinking time on eating lunch. The service was good and the place was well run.

The room was cleaned every day, exactly as you would hope, and the tea and coffee making facility was replenished with a pile of those individual milk containers rather than the four you often get. They cannot cost much but it's a nice touch.

We ate in the hotel's restaurant on the Sunday evening. It was a nice room with smartly presented tables. The waiter was very attentive and the meal was very reasonably priced at less than seventy euros for two three course meals and a bottle of wine. The food was quite good - I have had better, but probably not for the money we paid.

To round it off we got the bus link back to the airport. Book it at reception and the driver will call at the hotel to collect you. It costs 5 eu. per person, starts at 5.10am and takes about 30 minutes. Extremely handy.",4,2011,10,25
219,Dublin amazing - hotel mixed feelings!,"Loved Dublin and hotel is well placed for visit, booked standard room and first room allocated was disappointing as directly overlooked the railway bridge running through the hotel and was very small and dull. To be fair the staff were very helpful when we asked to change rooms or pay for an upgrade. An upgrade was not available but our room was changed to one which was much better. The problem for us is that the hotel was very noisy and the new room was directly above the bar and live music which kept us awake. Again when we asked to change rooms as we had an early flight the next day the staff were helpful and changed rooms again ......you couldnt ask for more !! The breakfast was good and as mentioned the staff helpful and friendly. However the standard rooms are basic and the noise from trains and traffic would probably sway us to choose another hotel on our definate return to Dublin. If on your ventures you consume copious amounts of alcohol this would help cushion the noise and you would sleep well. Overall helpful staff, reasonable value for money ..... just noisy !!!",3,2011,10,17
219,Great hotel!,"We stayed at this hotel as we were going to an event at the O2. The first member of staff we came across was the car park attendent who was very friendly and welcoming. The staff in the hotel were as welcoming and friendly and there was a professional yet relaxed atmosphere in the hotel. 

Other reviewers commented on the fact the trains pass by but it's quite clear that it's adjacent to Connolly station so trains would be expected. This didn't bother me as I only noticed 2 trains passing, it wasn't a bit deal.

The bedroom was well presented, clean and had everything we needed. Bathroom was dated but still very clean, plenty of towels etc. It's in a great location for access to city centre/O2/trains. There were a couple of unsavory characters late at night in the area but I would expect this for a hotel in Dublin City Centre...I mean The Gresham isn't exactly in the nicest of areas either in my opinion. 

I've often had parking issues with hotels in Dublin and by far I felt the parking facilities were outstanding. 24hr attended private car park, extremely safe. They offer a shuttle bus to and from the O2 for ‚Ç¨7 if you want it which we didn't use but was nice to have the option

All in all good value for money and definitely a hotel to use if you're going for a day of shopping or to the O2",4,2011,10,14
219,good Value for money!!,"The hotel itself isnt situated right in the middle of Dublin but its only around a 15 minutes walk to the town and what better way to find where the shops are!! 

The staff was very friendly and cleanedthe rooms daily including changing sheets!! 

At night after a certain time they lock the entrance to the hotel- as this is literally on the street- so you have to call the bell to get in.  In a way though it makes you feel safer to know the doors are manned and no access is available by any stranger! 

I would suggest using this hotel as it was a good price for one week and was also out of the way from temple bar so the noise level was low.",3,2011,10,10
219,"Excellent hotel, location & service","After always staying at one of the Jurys Inn hotels on previous visits, I decided after a hiatus of four years to try somewhere else and happened upon North Star after spotting a great deal for it on Expedia.

Easy to find opposite Connolly Station or round the corner from where the Airlink bus drops off, or for a Euro less than Airlink, North Star has its own shuttle.  I even arrived early at 8:15 and was able to leave my luggage and was told a room would be ready by 11.  A brisk walk and some breakfast later, the room was indeed ready at 11.

I was staying over a period of the worst rain Dublin had seen for a long time (the same three days that my English hometown were seeing their hottest October day ever!), and this is one hotel you don't mind killing time indoor in - comfortable residents lounge, pleasant bar attached, restaurant or perfectly acceptable bedrooms for staying in and keeping dry.

Contrary to comments below, I found all the reception staff helpful and friendly.  I didn't walk past once without a cheery greeting or a knowing nod as I waded past soaked to the skin.  The concierge downstairs seemed to be an endless fountain of local knowledge to fellow guests each time I came into the building.

TVs in the bedroom have Sky, or possibly Freeview (or whatever the Irish equivalent is), and TV is also available in the lounge and the bar.  My TV wasn't switched on once though, I come on holiday to get away from TV. Nobody should mark a hotel down because it doesn't have certain channels - record it at home and watch it when you get back.

I was happy to eat breakfasts at any of the endless array of cafes and snack bars lying between the hotel and O'Connell Street \ Temple Bar, but the one wet morning that I did eat in the hotel, it was an excellent breakfast - hot, fresh food and pleny of toast, tea and cereals.  A cheaper continental version is available too without the cooked option.

The location is perfect - away from the louder noise of the city centre, but just a 5 minute walk down Talbot Street from the O'Connell Street spire (a road which incidentally has the best bar in the world bar none, The Celt), or less than minutes walk from Templar Bar and less than 15 minutes walk from Grafton street and Stephens Green.

Also has its own shuttle to the O2 for all concerts.  Although I didn't go to a gig there, I did walk the couple of miles maximum to the arena where the docks and harbour are and the Dublin Eye wheel.

The point I deducted from it being a 5 rating was a combination of a couple of very minor issues - I would have liked wifi to be free to all guests.  It is free if you book directly via the website, but as I'd booked online via Expedia for a better deal, I would have had to pay for it.  However, nearly all bars, cafes, shopping centres and even some streets have free wifi, (just look for the signs in the doors) so I didn't bother to pay for it in the hotel.  And purely aesthetically, a couple of bathroom fittings were dropping off, but a loose toilet roll holder hardly ruins a holiday, does it?

I will definitely not be leaving it four years before heading back to Dublin, and am thinking of a winter break in the new year, and will definitely be returning to the North Star.  And although there's nothing wrong at all with the regular rooms, when I saw the low cost of upgrading to a premier room, I may just do that next time :-)

Thanks to all the staff for a great stay over what must have been a few very unpleasant, wet, miserable days for everyone!",4,2011,10,04
219,2 nights in Dublin,"Did not look as good in reality as its website depicted.  Interior drab in the main.  If you are a smoker do not be fooled by ""the garden heated comfortable surroundings"".  The outdoor heating was often not on, ashtrays never emptied and a couple of pot plants do not make a garden.  The doors from the smoking room to the bar were wedged open so non-smokers were affected while they ate their bar meals.  Staff on reception were helpful and welcoming.  Our executive room was comfortable but basic and not as we were led to believe it would be.  Breakfast is in  a stuffy cellar and staff were too rushed to be helpful.  We have stayed at better hotels for less money and would not recommend it.",3,2011,09,28
219,Would stay here again...,"We stayed here for two nights and throughly enjoyed our stay. The room and hotel were very clean and modern. Our room was noisy due to trains going past but didn't stop us from sleeping at night so not a big issue. We enjoyed Dublin and if we were to go again we would definatley stay again! 

Samantha and simon ",4,2011,09,24
219,Short Weekend Trip To Dublin,"We arrived at the hotel and first impressions did put us off ( outside looks as it could do with some repainting, the inside the paintwork was dull and uninviting and the 1st floor reception was dimly lit )  The reception staff were welcoming and helpfull and as we had arrived early in the morning our bags were locked away until our room was ready.The room itself and the toilet was very clean and tidy ,there was plenty of tea and coffee, suger and milk and a hairdryer in the top drawer, the only down side was that the double bed sagged towards the middle. The full Irish breakfast was excellent again the staff cannot be faulted,the down side was that the dining room was very hot with little ventilation which made me uncomfortable while eating being seated near to the hot plates ( the 2nd morning I asked for a table away from the hot plates but still found the area warm ) Overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel .",3,2011,09,22
219,"Lovely hotel with friendly, helpful staff","Last week, I stayed in the North Star Hotel just across from Connolly Station for two nights, and found the recently refurbished hotel very comfortable, and the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly, none of the impersonal service you experience in some hotels these days. The manager always addressed me by my name, making me feel welcomed, and my custom appreciated. Brilliant location for going to the Point / O2.",4,2011,09,21
219,Average but not wheelchair friendly,"This hotel was in a great location as it is opposite Connolly station.  The good was lovely and plenty of variety.  Rooms were clean, but beds sagged in the middle.  Pressure in the shower was bad.  The reception is on the first floor so you have to go up the stairs and there is no lift to reception.  Overall is was an average hotel but not good if you were in a wheelchair or had children in prams.",3,2011,09,18
219,Fab Nite,"Me and my friend stayed for 1 night ,we arrived around 11am ,we were able to leave our bags in reception ,then we were on our way the hotel gave us directions to the shops and we went on our way,every one was so friendly, when we asked for  extra milk and tea bags  they were happy to give us some ,very friendly and happy to help ,had a great stay thank you all very much xxxx",4,2011,09,17
219,Good Stay,"Staff were great, room was a premier and good for the price. The only reason it got 4 stars is that you have to pay for wi-fi.  5E for 1 hour or 11E for 24hours, a total rip off as most good hotels offer it for free, so if you need to use Wi-Fi a lot chose a differant hotel.  Come on North Star sort it out!!!",4,2011,09,16
219,15 minutes walk to Templebar,"I do not like when extras, like breakfast, internet connection, parking cost extra - very much extra. We were lucky to be upgraded to better rooms than booked, and thereby gaining access to the executive lounge on the 7th floor. Somewhat disappointed though since very little was offered except coffee/tea, biscuites and the view of Dublin.",3,2011,09,12
219,We hated this hotel- the trains drove up bonkers,"If you want to sleep don't stay here. Where can I start!!! First of all we booked a standard room but then upgraded as we wanted a room where we could not see people looking into our room from the train. So we asked at reception for a room without train tracks but the receptionist could hardly speak English. The premier room was bang outside a train track and it was noisy that we would get woken up in the middle of the night. As for the air con although it was Sept we put it on but it made such a loud terrible noise. The shower was terrible too not powerful at all. Also as we had upgraded and a continental breakfast was included but everytime we went for breakfast we were told that we were not on the list and that they would have to call reception. This went on for 4 days and was annoying as well as embarassing.
The resturant downstairs had terrible food which was also over priced. The internet access was so expensive at 3 euros per 20 mins! 
This hotel is not disabled friendly. Be aware that the reception is on the next floor and that you need to walk up stairs as there is no lift to get to reception. 
I would not stay here again. The receptionist was unfriendly. Also there was no sky tv in the premier lounge area. We were disappointed with the tv channels and there were about 8 of them.
I would not recommend staying here that's for sure.",1,2011,09,11
219,Loved it and will be back,"myself and my husband spent three nights here this week and i have to say it was a fantastic hotel, we felt the staff were very helpful nothing was too much bother and they were friendly and polite, we stayed in the premier rooms and had a lovely balcony view over dublin, it was also close to all the main shopping and nightlife areas. Definately we will be back",5,2011,09,05
219,Worst hotel experience ever!,"The Hotel smells of mildew. No Porter. Front desk located up a flight of steps. Premier club is advertised at an additional 30 Euros But if you want the room in the advertisement, it is 50 Euros. Food was horrible in the pub. Internet service was non available for over 4 days.",1,2011,09,01
219,Enjoyable Stay!!!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel for the Lady Gaga Concert (sorry for only writing a review now). First Impressions on the outside of the Hotel was that it looked nice despite being close to the road! We dropped the car of in the hotel parking area, which was a bit of squeeze and we had to leave the car keys with the man. We understand that this was incase he had to move the car but we weren't 100% comfortable with this. However we were pleased that it was in a secure location. 
We went in to the front of the hotel and we were greeted by the reception staff who were very helpful and friendly, there was a issue with my card and they helped 100% until it was sorted. The Bar and Reception area was very nicely decorated and laid out. We then got our key card and went up to the room. The room was a very nice size, a nice temperature and bathroom was very spacious and clean. We had a big double bed and was very comfortable. A very good hotel, very reasonably priced, and we will definitely be back if we ever venture to another concert in Dublin. Thank you.",5,2011,08,31
219,Had hoped for a better experience,"Some friends and I booked this hotel for a birthday weekend in Dublin, after reading reviews on the hotel, I thought we hit the jackpot after paying just ¬£57 each for 2 nights bed and breakfast!! However.. the price soon revealed itself just after we checked in...

We arrived at the hotel at around 6:30pm after a late flight with Ryanair.

Firstly our party was split up on different floors which was slightly disappointing, But we were given our room number.. we tried the card key in the door several times and it didnt work, we consulted the reception whom passed the matter to the maintainence guy, he pressed a few buttons which got the door open. 

Pushing this aside, the room was clean, spacious and comfortable (especially the beds) and I was very pleased with what we received until...

We were ready to go out..we shut the door behind us but double checked it.. this time the door wouldnt lock. this became very frustrating as we were eager to go out but again the matter was passed from the maintainence guy to the manager. 

He told us that he would get a member of staff check our room every 15 minutes whilst we were out for the evening.. which I was NOT happy with! 

After making this known to the manager that I wanted to change rooms (which ofcourse was told they didnt have any other rooms available blah blah blah) he got a new lock on the door for us. Although.. by this time it was gone 11pm.

The manager fixed the door and offered us an upgrade to a more luxury room for our inconvienence for our next night.

After coming back in at around 4am from our night out in city centre, the hotel doors were locked, we rang the bell and was very unhappily greeted by a member of staff who stood at the door and said ""What do you want?!!!!!"" and looked in disbelief at us when we said we were staying here for the night. Had it not of been for the maintainence man who was standing behind him recognising us, he may not of let us in!

I cant complain about the breakfast, it was absolutely delicious and plenty of choice.. ofcourse we never got our upgrade in the end, so I believe it was just said to shut me up and the manager couldnt even look me in the face when he saw me in the restaurant.

Im definitely not one to ever write a bad review.. being 22 years old ive stayed in 2* and always tried to see the positive side. 

However, good customer service and no problems to interupt my stay at a hotel are the basic things that helps me to enjoy my break. Unfortunately I wont be recommended this hotel to any of my customers nor staying there again myself. ¬£57 each was a fantastic price...but thats about it.",3,2011,08,29
219,Decent hotel near Connolly station.,"We arrived at the hotel and the staff were friendly and nice.  We checked in without a hitch.  Our room had two beds which was fine but my bed had a dip in the middle which wasn't very comfortable.  A friend of ours stayed at this hotel and told us that it was reasonably priced with free wi-fi.  We needed the wi-fi to book flights, trains and hotels across Europe.  When the wi-fi stopped working, I asked the front desk about it and they said they were going to get it fixed the next day. This would have been fine had they fixed it the next day like they said but that did not happen.  I'm not sure if other guests were complaining too but the day following the next day, they gave me the run around by saying they were still working on it. What does that mean?  No one seemed to took ownership of the problem by looking into the matter. They had one working computer with Internet at the reception desk but there was a queue. I would have just liked to have recevied some customer service reassuring me that it was actively being worked on. That's all.

It's a decent hotel.  The is pub around the corner that we enjoyed going to. But I wouldn't stay here again.  ",3,2011,08,28
219,Dont book this hotel if you are going to Dublin Zoo,"I booked a room here as they had a special offer on their website, ‚Ç¨129 for 2 adults + 2 kids, Family Ticket for the Zoo & ""Breakfast Included"".  I ended up paying ‚Ç¨155 (‚Ç¨15.50 Deposit).  The offer has since been removed but if you google it and view the cache you can see it!  
Having received the confirmation email there was no mention of Zoo tickets and it said breakfast is continental.  There was no mention in the booking process that breakfast was continental...breakfast is full unless otherwise stated in my opinion...a sneaky little trick.  So I emailed about the tickets, which they replied within an hour, that tickets weren't included and confirmed about the breakfast.  Ok, its a mistake on their website, these things happen, but I should get my deposit back.  When I emailed again 3 days ago to cancel and request a refund, explaining the story very politely, my email was ignored.  So after just phoning them my reservation wasn't cancelled.
Appalling customer service.",1,2011,08,25
219,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed here for 1 night while attending the Roger Waters concert.  Very reasonable for a mid week stay - ‚Ç¨75 for b&b for the night (double room).  Hotel is literally a 5 min walk down from Busaras.  The hotel is not in an ideal area as there would be some funny characters hanging around but we had no issues.   
When you walk into the hotel, you have the bar to the right which could do with a little refurbishment (especially the carpet!)  You go up a few steps to reception, check-in very quick, hotel seems to be very popular for concert goers & sports fans.   Receptionist asked if we were going to Roger Waters  as they provided a coach for it - which cost ‚Ç¨7 each which was good as did not have hassle after the concert to get back to the hotel & was a good opportunity to mix with other guests that were attending the concert.
After the concert, we drank in the hotel - as smokers, they have a great smoking area - very spacious & a chill out atomsphere.  Drink is also reasonable for Dublin.
Room was standard room &  ok for our needs - clean and comfortable.
I booked this hotel for my mam & mam in law for the Katherine Jenkins concert & they were given a compliementary suite which they were thrilled with!
Breakfast was included in our booking which was self service ranging from full irish to continental & you could have as much as you wanted.    Full Irish is very tasty!   Staff very friendy & helpful.
I would recommend this hotel to my friends.",4,2011,08,14
219,Comfortable and just the job,"We stayed here for a short break to Dublin. The hotel was comfortable for this purpose, but the air con and electric goes off when you leave the room, and the cleaner will remove the keycard from the electric slot if you cheekily leave the spare one in while out.
Unusually for a three star, there is a concierge and he is very good. We gave him a specification of a romantic meal, where we could go dressed up and have a good time. He used his knowledge and contacts to fit us in to a really nice restaurant, so much so I tipped him the next day.
Unfortunatly the reception was that of a large chain (not sure if this hotel is part of a chain) and was very much ""Name, reservation No, give room key, Next customer"". 
The room we had was facing the railway line, but was not noisy at all.

The breakfast was good, all you can eat and was tasteful, although for some strange reason only staff were allowed to put toast into the rotating (self service in other hotels) toasting machine.",4,2011,08,13
219,"Tried tested,never fails","We have stayed at North Star Hotel Dublin biannually for the last ten or twelve years for leisure and theatre breaks. The hotel is located near to Dublin city centre and all main transport links to and from the city. The staff are very pleasant and helpful in all departments, nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel comfortable and welcome, a real home from home. The rooms are spotless and very well furnished, with hospitality facilities and the room service is first class. The breakfasts are substantial and offers a great range from breakfast juice, fresh fruit, cereal and the ""full Irish"" is indeed a filling experience. All this is served on buffet basis with staff in attendance to help if required. The dinner is first class, served in a quiet restaurant with table service or in the more in formallsetting of the in house bistro. Most of the staff have worked there for many years and we feel this is a good indicator of the type of establishment the North Star is. On our last visit we were given a complime ntary update to premium suite, lovely gesture and we felt like royalty for our stay. Very much appreciated!  We have recommended this hotel to many of our friends and glad to say, they were not disappointed. Long may the North Star continue to shine!",5,2011,08,12
219,Make sure you book the premier rooms,"We have stayed in this hotel quite a number of times now. Only once did we book the executive rooms and that was a mistake to say the least.  If I had of book on of these rooms the first time I went I would not have went back.  I am quite particular about my hotel rooms and the premier club rooms are amazing. Very comfortable beds, nice bathroom, massive TV and clean. Every time however we have been here there has never been a single person in the club lounge. The bar downstairs has one of the nicest bar man in it ever.  Extremely friendly, I think he might have originally lived in Donegal as far as I can remember.  We used the residents lounge once situated beside the front desk and would not do again.  We were basically pushed out.  I would recommend anyone to purchase their drink in the bar and take to their rooms instead of using the residents lounge.  I would still stay here again but it would only be the premier rooms.",4,2011,08,09
219,Well placed to get around,"This was a decent hotel,room was clean,clean towels each day, tea stocks replenished,bed was one of the most comfy i have slept in,our room was directly opposite the rail line,this was'nt a problem and did not cause us any bother.Hotel is well placed,right across from the train station and within easy reach of town centre ( 5 minute walk ) yes there were a few questionable characters around outside but no more or worse than i would find in my home city of Manchester, i did not feel threatened,altho we did'nt venture out much at night as we had children with us so cannot say what it is like then.
Only gripe would be the rail on the inside wall over the bath was loose,this could be a danger for elderly people were they to grab it while taking a shower (room 457) I would stay there again if i venture to Dublin again.",4,2011,08,05
219,ROOM 116 Seriously !!!,"Stayed in the North Star as the hotel we booked first over booked us. Arrived with a nice welcome by the car park attendent and reception. Got room 116 which something like Harry Potters bedroom under the stairs only worse. Harry didnt have a train track above him or 4 air conditioning units outside his window. I Could just about get past the bed to reach the bathroom, the aircon units blasted of every 15 minutes all night, the shower unit was that small I had to squeeze in to get the door closed and then there was the water pressure or should I say lack off !!!. Seriously I think this room was a store or linen press converted to a room. Was not expecting much for 110 Euro B&B but Seriously.  
The Hotel does have lots of character and serves a nice breakfast but rooms need a good gutting and re fresh.  Good location during the day! not so nice at night. Taxi....",1,2011,08,04
219,the reviews do not do this hotel justice,"We stayed at the North Star for a mid week beak. However we will admit to being a bit worried after reading the reviews it received on Trip advisor. 
The hotel is located across the road from the main train station. People have complained re the noise of the trains. Well you can hear the trains but what do people expect. The location for the trains, O connell street and tourist buses make it an excellent stop for tourists. 
The rooms where clean ,tidy and modern. Coffee and tea making facilties/ towels were also provided. They were topped up regularly .
We had breakfast and it was fresh, plentiful and tea and coffee was very good.
The staff were helpful ,pleasant and couldnt do enough for you.  Some of the other reviews are not very postive towards the staff.  However I can honestly say they all were perfect.
It begs the question what do people expect. This is not an expensive hotel, but gives an excellent service.",5,2011,08,03
219,"Mixed feelings, doubt I'll be back","Firstly, reservation staff were very helpful, it was on arrival things went a bit pear shaped. 

I went into the carpark ‚Ç¨7/8 for the night, met by this guy who looked like he could have come from the street, spoke hardly any english, basically shouted at me, I take your car, I take. No hope of me parking it, so a little uneasy (after taking everything possible out of the car) I handed it over, only then to be told I could not have my keys back until morning to make me feel alot better. 

Upon check in, no way could I get my keys back, but staff were friendly, went up to my room, (not on the railway side), room was nice & clean, albeit a bit on the small side. Then I decided to go down for dinner, didnt fancy restaurant, maybe I should have, the bar was stuck in a time warp being propped up by the locals, found it grubby in there so decided to take my food to my room when it came out. Very uninspiring or tasty, greasy food. Needless to say, the plate wasnt cleared. 

All in all, room was ok, most staff fine, but doubt i'll be back, plenty of other hotels in the area for similar price.",2,2011,08,02
219,Not that great,"When we got there they insisted we should pay upfront, quite rude about it at the desk, found room very dark but the beds were very comfortable. Wasn't very happy when I received a phone call before checking out time asking us to leave the room. In the financial area but not to far from where the action is, but I wouldn't go back to the hotel again.",3,2011,08,02
219,Great place to stay,Close to railway. Great large rooms. Easy walking distance to the main are of Dublin,4,2011,07,28
219,Terrific stay,"Hotel,staff,food,and accommodation were tip top and would recommend this hotel to all tripadvisor customers.  Excellent stay and will be back for sure.",5,2011,07,27
219,"what a wonderfal hotel, will be back","me and my wife went to the north star hotel for our honeymoon and was really supprised how lovely our stay was
the staff where polite and helpful, the food was perfect and the value for money was beyond our expectations,
it is a well presented hotel the bar and the staff was perfect even had a live band. 
we cant wait to return here.",5,2011,07,25
219,It was good but not wow...,"Spent 4 nites at North Star hotel. Basic, all u need. Good sleep, new towels every day. Breakfast was good not much choice for vegetarians. Few minutes walk from tram and train station which was very handy. About 10 min from city centre.",4,2011,07,20
219,Do not waste your money here,"Please do not get caught the way we did.  two of us were treating our friend to the weekend here for her birthday needless to say we were so embarassed.  The hotel website is not what you get! What you do get is cramped, old fashionied, shabby accommodation with a complimentary train rumbling by at regular intervals!! The location has its good and bad points.  Good location for tourists but in bad area  as we learned the hard way!  The staff don't really care too much, there is an older man working in the bar and lets just say he knows his stuff when it comes to insulting guests and customers alike.  There was a barman John and our receptionist on check out that was very nice and helpful, other than those definately wouldn't rate the staff.  I can't beg enough for you not to waste your hard earned money here and to top it off we paid alot of money for the ""pleasure"" of staying here.",1,2011,07,20
219,Very central hotel decorated in a modern style,"Overall I was very happy with my stay. The room was clean and comfortable with everything I needed for my 2 day break. The central location was fantastic. 
The only slight negative was on the second day when I called reception to say I had a guest arriving and asked if they could be directed to my room. Unfortunately when my guest arrived they were treated very rudely by the girl on reception. However this was a small blip in an otherwise pleasant break. ",4,2011,07,19
219,"Needs an update, but great value and good service","Can't complain for the money we paid.  Staff friendly.

Our room was ok.  Could smell cigarette smoke though - didn't think that was allowed anymore. Old TV always a disappointed in this age of cheap flat screen TVs (not that we went to Dublin to watch TV, it's just that antique TVs stick out). Breakfast was fine too.  Hate having to pay through the nose for internet access which didn't work in any case so we did get a refund.  But overall great value for money.",4,2011,07,18
219,only ok,stayed here    was charged twice for my stay but was refunded        room ok     filled out comment card  had been there since May   in thee room  had to pay for overnight parking in the train station    which was five min walk from hotel,2,2011,07,13
219,"Nice, Old Fashioned","This hotel was rather nice, convenient to city. The room was small but adequate and was reasonably comfortable. Breakfast was fine.",3,2011,07,10
219,Average hotel clean and friendly,"stayed here for the take that concert. hotel was an excellent location for our stay. just right outside the train station and about 10 minute walk from croke park. hotel itself was clean, staff at reception were friendly. the bar could do with a major re-vamp though. room was clean and bed sheets clean bathroom small but clean and done the job. liked that only people staying at the hotel could only get up to the rooms by using their key cards to get through the main door. 

only thing i could fault a bit noisy with the train station beside the hotel - but you already know this before you book - not much can be done about it. 

also they advertised there was free wifi - all four of us connected ok to it - but didnt work :(",3,2011,07,05
219,People need to stop complaining!,"4 of us were heading to the Glee concert at the 02 arena and needed somewhere local, clean and safe to rest our heads for the night.  We got a good package deal that included breakfast and we were all VERY pleased with our service.

The hotel is indeed near a train line, but on the occasions that a train passed, it was actually kinda soothing and nice.  It wasn't screeching, horrible or worrying to hear AT ALL.

We got two twin rooms and the beds were AMAZINGLY comfortable.  Standard set up room, bathroom, ironing board, tea/coffee facilities, T.V., chair, mirror, lamps and beds.  Ideal and very clean.  It was a hot sticky night and the A/C unit was fantastic for cooling us down and was an added bonus for sure.

If I had to mention 1 gripe from the stay, it would be to say for others to NOT touch the temperature guage on the showers as it went from freezing to scalding hot very quickly.  This is not a major priblem though and nothing to worry about.

Breakfast was downstairs and was yummy.  Good irish breakfast, again, good service, clean and inviting.

To say the hotel was in the middle of nowhere or out of the way is a complete lie!  It is RIGHT OPPOSITE  THE TRAIN STATION and ROUND THE CORNER from the BUS STATION.  It's a 10-15 minute walk to various shopping and other attraction destinations.

As a native of Ireland and a regular Dublin city goer, you can't go wring with this hotel and we will def. be returning here from now on.

It's cheap and chearful and we got an excellent night of sleep.  I really have NO IDEA what other negative reviewers are talking about!",5,2011,07,05
219,"Excellent Hotel,Would Rebook Again","Booked the northstar hotel as a weekend break for my wife's birthday, was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews, but no need to have worried.  Booked premier club suite on hotel website, on arrival,reception staff very helpful & courteous,checked in & went up to suite, everything was as described on website,very clean & bed was very big & comfortable !!!!
Would recommend booking suite as little extra's are included, free wi-fi, safe, fridge in room & access to premier club lounge on  top floor with complimentary bottles of  water, tea/coffee, hot chocolate & biscuits !!!! (perfect for relaxing after a long day out)
Breakfast is excellent & with great choice of food, staff very friendly & helpful.
Hotel location is great,only 10 minute walk to O'Connell street & temple bar.
All in all a fantastic weekend,Thank You Northstar",5,2011,07,02
219,Would not recommend,The noise from the trains was horrible and we're not very particular about that. The rooms were dirty. The front desk staff was not very helpful. The location was not ideal. We needed a cab to get into town.,2,2011,07,01
219,Exceeded our expectations!,"After booking the hotel then reading a couple of the comments on here we didn't quite know what to expect HOWEVER we were absolutely thrilled with our stay and can find little to moan about.  Yes the hotel is positioned next to a busy railway but don't let this put you off, it's really not loud enough to affect your sleep especially if your stay was anything like ours - out early & returning late evening.
The room was spacious, very clean & modern, with a nice little balcony - very handy for the smokers.  The double bed was massive & I can't tell you how comfortable it was!  The room had great facilities such as an iron, fridge and a really cool safe, big enough to store my DSLR camera bag plus more.
We would highly recommend the breakfast, you have everything on offer for a full irish & you serve yourself so eat as much as you want ;-)  For the more health conscious, you have a nice selection of cereal & fruit.
We did not eat from the restaurant so cannot comment on that but we did go for some pub grub next door which you can access direct from the hotel.  The place would benefit from a lick of paint but no complaints about the food, everything we had was really nice and staff friendly.
The location of the hotel is ideal, being just outside the train station & five minutes from Busaras Bus Station & also near is O'Connell Street, the river & Temple Bar area etc.  There is a handy Spar shop two minutes away from the hotel too.  
If we return to Dublin, we will definitely be staying at this hotel again.  Many thanks!",5,2011,06,28
219,Good value for city centre loaction,"After booking a two night, family zoo deal at this hotel I heard alot of bad things about it and was somewhat concerned but given a quarter of the booking had been automatically charged to my card was reluctant to cancel the booking and the thing that drew us to this hotel was its location across from Connolly Station were we arrived. However on arival was pleasantly surprised and while check in went with a few minor hiccups, ie being charged too much due to a computer error as well as being sent to a room that wasnt ready and having to check into another on a different floor, staff were quite efficient in trying to resolve the matter. The room was big enough to accomodate myself and my friend and our two young children and was clean and airy and relatively quiet considering its city centre location. The only downfall was on entering there are a number of steps up to reception which is not very wheelchair or pram friendly and its difficult to manage bags and a pram and young children in prams when you go in and out, but staff are helpful if you ask. The breakfast included was very impressive and a fair amount of choice, the waiting staff were very efficient and on the second morning the waitress automatically brought us tea/coffee, remembering from the day before which was a lovely touch and she was very friendly with the children. The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of many shops on Connolly street but also within close proximity of the luas and buses should you wish to go further or reach other landmarks. Overall we were very happy with the hotel and would consider staying here again.",4,2011,06,20
219,A STAFF MEMBER IN TRAINERS AND A JUMPER?,"I HAD A LOVELY STAY IN YOUR HOTEL , STAFF VERY FRIENDLY . rooms very clean and comfortable, but when i went down for breakfast the room was very busy . i was shocked to see a member of your staff working as a waitress  was wearin trainers and a jumper and also here hair was not tied up when she was makin toast  were all other staff members were dressed appropiate and looked the part .I COULD NOT BELEIVE WHAT I SAW ! Also when when i was checking out i seen this staff member behind reception helping out which did not look well for the hotels presentation! i was very disapointed as i stay in hotels alot with my job! Great hotel and staff but your staff member looked like she took no pride in her apperience witch made me not finish my breakfast.",4,2011,06,13
219,"Great Hotel, we'd stay again","Stayed here one night in June 2011.  Looking at the reviews it would appear we got one of the better rooms- a Premier Club King Room.  We booked it on a hotel booking website and not directly with the hotel and paid 59 Euros. There were signs in the hotel advising to book directly with them for a better deal, however their website states the room we stayed in starts at 95 Euros a night. Aside from that, the room was absolutely brilliant! I couldn‚Äôt fault it in anyway. CLEAN, spacious, tea and coffee making facilities, ironing board and iron in the room, large telly with adequate channel selections, shower, bath, hair dryer and the bed was very comfortable.  We were a bit travel weary when we arrived by train so the fact it was so close to the train station was a bonus!  The staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful.  As my husband and I are both smokers so having a balcony was also a bonus.  (The hotel we stayed in previous nights you had to get completely dressed, go down 6 floors and stand in the rain. In the mornings we were continuously approached by homeless people wanting money or cigarettes in the evening we had to deal with lout-ish drunks from the pub across the street).  But thankfully we didn‚Äôt have to experience that at the North Star.  We had one meal at McCoy‚Äôs bar, 2x burger and chips and 2x cokes.  The food and portion size was great, however we thought that 26.50 Euros was a bit steep for burger and chips.  The trains are about 100 yards away and run right past the hotel frequently however we are not light sleepers so that noise didn‚Äôt bother us.   Admittedly the hotel is in what could be a considered a dodgy part of town after dark which may be a bit intimidating to some travellers. However we weren‚Äôt put off by that nor is it the hotel‚Äôs fault.   There is a cash point right around the corner and a Spar shop which I found helpful.  We didn‚Äôt mind carrying our bags up one flight of stairs to get to reception, can‚Äôt believe people moan about that.  I‚Äôm sure if you are elderly or handicapped the staff were so helpful I‚Äôm sure they would be happy to assist.  Would recommend to a friend.",5,2011,06,11
219,Would stay again,"I stayed with family members in a 2 bedroom suite. Very clean, comfortable bedrooms and living area. Would recommend it for a family that want to stay together while in a hotel. Slightly cheaper than two separate double rooms. So worth the value.
Car park by the hotel very small and narrow but very kind staff will park your car for you at a cost of ‚Ç¨7 per night and ‚Ç¨2 for every extra hour after check-out next. well worth it.
The hotel is directly across from Connolly Train St and wihin 10min walking distance of the city centre. One needs to take care in the vicinity at night if it is late. Streets would not be the safest! Hotel breakfast was very good. Great variety and  excellent service from staff. Hotel bar is comfortable, a little old fashioned but ok!! Overall, I was very happy with the stay and would recommend it to anyone.",4,2011,06,08
219,lovely hotel,"my family and I booked this hotel for 1 night in may 2011. I booked directly on line and then read the reviews posted here. I  have to say it made me very apprehensive and worried but I felt I had to write my own review following our stay. Our room was lovely and clean, the staff we came in contact with were very pleasant and helpful and the breakfast was absolutely superb. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.",4,2011,05,30
219,Disappointed,"I have to say that I was disappointed in the hotel, as for all the nice photos on the website, it is clear that if you end up in the original part of the hotel, you are getting a substandard experience.

When you arrive you find out that the reception is upstairs, with no lift. Its actually under the railway line, yes thats right the hotel has a railway line over it, the reception connects the old and new parts of the hotel. So you have to drag your bags up the stairs. Once allocated the room, if you are in the original part, you have to drag the bags up the stairs again, no lift.

Once in the standard room, the 1st thing I noticed was the 24inch television as quoted on the website was a 14/15 inch portable. This is high up on the wall in the corner of the room and difficult to watch, the channel choice was poor. The bathroom was generally clean though it looked dated and it took ages to get hot water, there clearly was a pressure problem, which we complained about but never got resolved.

We had a meal in the resturaunt, this was very dissapointing, certainly not worth the money we paid.

On the positive sides, I really liked the bed, and it was only a 10 minute walk from O'Connell Street",3,2011,05,27
219,think before you book,"i booked this hotel for an overnight with my mother and toddler. I arrived in the car park and was greeted with a car park attendent who informed me that he would park my car in this car park ( that had space for around 6 cars). i then had to leave my keys with him, in his tiny hut and that i would not get them back until i checked out. This service would in turn cost me 7 euros! Reluctantly I agreed but as any one with small children knows it is inconvienent when you have to take everything you need out of your car in one go!. To access the reception area you must climb one flight of stairs which would cause difficulties not just for myself with a buggy but also for those with mobility problems. Once you get to the first floor there is a lift availble and once you have a room card you can leave the 1st floor via a ramp through the Car park where staff smoke on their breaks and walk round to the front of the hotel!
I then checked in to my executive suite which was comfortable yet basic and the rumble of trains was quite a distraction ( although not the hotels fault).
We ate of the bar menu which was difficult as my mother doesn't eat chicken which left only a panni or hambuger as her two choices! There was also no children's menu which doesnt display a very family friendly policy!
I was unaware that children had to leave all licensed areas at 6pm on a sunday in Dublin and although we got to stay longer than that time, we had no other area to take my toddler except to the room! I did speak to the manager the next day who was very pleasant and appeared to take my concerns regarding there lack of family friendly policy  on board. Not ideal for a family break",2,2011,05,24
219,would not stay at this hotel again,"We travelled to Dublin to attend the Europa League final, and had booked to stay in Lynams Hotel on O'connell st.  without our prior consent they switched us to North Star.  they said it was because they could not use their street-front rooms because of the Queen's visit.
the North Star was unappealing from outside.  the room was clean but very basic.  Right outside our window was the DART.  We were told, on enquiring, that it would stop at 11pm.  It rattled by every few minutes, and began again at about 5 am.
the bathroom had the very basics; two small bottles of shampoo, three towels.  we didn't bother making a fuss, as we were only staying one night, and because of demand would not have got a room elsewhere anyway.  i certainly wouldn't recommend this hotel and would not stay there again",2,2011,05,23
219,Very basic and dodgy,"The room we stayed in backed onto a back street. The window was filthy and one of the bed side lights didn't work. The beds also sagged. The bathroom was clean but dated.
The location was good but the room we got was NOT what is pictured on their webpage. I complained that the room was not up to what they advertised or were displaying on the TV at reception so the girl at reception (who was very helpful), gave us a free breakfast.
We were concerned about the sign in the room which said 'If this room has to be fumigated you will be charged 100 Euros'.  Gross! We couldn't help but scratch and made sure our luggage was off the floor. My teenage kids rated this as the worse room they stayed in on the trip.",2,2011,05,16
219,Wanted to stay another night!,We stayed here for one night! It was so handy to get of the train n the hotel was just around the corner! The hotel was very clean! and staff very friendly! the room cleaner! Was brilliant so much so we left her a nice wee tip! The breakfast was really good too! ,4,2011,05,05
219,24 hours is plenty of time in this hotel,"Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel as we were going to the O2 to see Peter Kay. Check in was excellent and the hotel Receptionist was very nice. 

On our arrival to the hotel we were a little taken aback as the area in which the hotel is suituated - would not be the most up market of areas. The hotel was suitated across from Connoly Station which was great when travelling by train. The Reception area both upstairs and downstairs were nice. We stayed in one of the Premier Suites - and to be honest there was nothing very exciting about it. We had a small bathroom - very clean, but they could fix the handle on the shower as it kept falling off and there was black marks running all across the side of the bath. The room itself was ok - big bed but the size of the room was of a standard size to hotels I have stayed in before. We had a balcony but the view was not very pretty - the 7th floor rooms looked down on a very dirty, old and not so nice part of the city, The noise at night was very annoying as the trains and lucas runs right passed the front of the hotel. We had food in the main bar, just lets say you would not want to be in a hurry as it took over 30mins for a toasted sandwich and chips. The hotels main bar is very run down with old diry carpet on the floors, the table are very badly woren and written all over. 
We were told when we were booking that The Premier Club Sites include access to the private lounge upstair, but when we as to go in we were told it was closed, so I dont think there is must point having an upgrade when the rooms are no bigger or better than a standard double room in any 3 star hotel - we did'nt see what they called a Standard Double, but I hope they were not any smaller than the suites.
Overall the hotel is fine for a 1 night stay, but no more than that.
Ok I must say the Barman was very nice and very helpful.",2,2011,04,30
219,Great Stay at the North Star Hotel in Dublin,"I was on a leisure trip for 14 days.With my 90 year old mother. I used the North Star to be my base in Dublin . The room was great. The staff were perfect. and most helpful.A good value for a 14 day stay.
The food in the hotel was better than most hotels.
They have a great breakfast buffet. , lunch in their pub.and supper in thier dining room.
This hotel is near all the stores,my mother a I took a walk almost every day to one of the stores.
I found the area most friendly and no matter what others say I felt perfectly safe at all times.",5,2011,04,30
219,"Great service, but everything else was not great","We stayed 2 nights here because the price was right. On the positive side- the staff was friendly and helpful always! The negatives were that it was quite a walk to the south side of town, where all of the activities are, the hotel seems to be quite popular with the Stag and Hen party crowd and with paper thin walls we heard all of the goings on throughout the hotel all night long!
There was some confusion, as I thought breakfast was included and it was not..10 euros seemed a bit high for the food given. granted I'm not Irish and was not a fan of the ""Irish Breakfast"" Cheaper and tastier food can be found at a cafe just 2 minutes down the road.
Overall, if I went to Dublin again, I would find a place more near the city center. Or I would ask to have a room maybe at the end of the hall where at least on a few sides there would be no neighbors.",3,2011,04,26
219,Fourth stay in four years. I would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.,"My fourth annual stay at the hotel, and the best yet. The staff go out of their way to be friendly and helpful, and when there was an issue with my room when I first went to it, I showed it to Damian, a member of the management team, and having said it was unacceptable upgraded me to one of the Premier Suites. The ""ordinary"" rooms are good, but the Suite was exceptional - and I suppose I will always want to stay in one of these rooms in the future!

Trains do rumble past from about 6.30 am until 11.30pm - but when you have a bed as comfortable as the ones at the North Star, and you are tired after a day of traipsing around, you WILL sleep!!

The breakfast is one of the hotel's defining strengths - one of the best buffets for both carivores and herbivores I have experienced in a 3 star hotel in the British Isles. The girls on duty are very efficient and with a charming manner and the selection of items is tremendous overall, although I do wish that the black and the white pudding could be cooked to retain some moisture!

Excellent, friendly efficient reception staff, an absolute gem of a front of house guy in Ciaran and a bar manager who has offered to get in my favourite tipple (Tullamore Dew irish whiskey) if I let him know before my next stay and you quite simply have a hotel that embodies all that is great about a warm Irish welcome and a caring spirit.  Thank you so much!!",5,2011,04,17
219,excellent value,"Stayed in this hotel recently in the premier suites for really good rate.the rooms are modern, clean and comfortable. the rates here are very good for city centre and from someone who works in the industry there are many hotels offering rates similar or lower and the rooms are very run down and not clean enough. highly recommeded and will definately be staying when im next in dublin.",5,2011,04,14
219,"Great Rooms for the price,great location and friendly staff.","My wife and I stayed at the North Star for 3 nights, check in fine, room good size and comfortable, staff always said hello. The hotel is situated across from Connelly Station heard trains pass however noise was unobtrusive and added to the charm of the hotel.
Comfortable bed and and nice bathroom and good shower with toiletries etc. The pub in the hotel is open late for residents and is great for a late drink only for hotel guests as you need your room card to get in from the hotel. Easy walking distance from hotel to Grafton St, O'Connell Street we even walked to the guinness brewery on a fine day. Overall a great value hotel that was worth the cash 155 euros for 3 nights. Would recommend.",4,2011,04,08
219,"upgrade your room, well worth it!","stayed at the hotel for 2 nights,we had a very early flight and so appreciated that we were too early to check in, however we were able to leave our cases whilst our room became available.The service that we received was fantastic and so am very suprised at some of the reviews, We had a premier room on the 6th floor, and could not fault the room, the bathroom was of an excellent standard and the beds very comfortable, there was a free safe in the room and flat screen tv, the free WIFI was very speedy and we had no problems getting the code from reception, the hotel offers shuttle service to the O2 for 7.50 return and also transfers to the airport for only 5 euros per person, the transfers operate at 2 hourly intervals and so if they fall right with your flights well worth it as the taxi to the hotel from the airport cost 24 euros, the breakfast was lovely, the first day we were shown to our table but the second morning we were just summoned by a lady with blond hair who just said 'come' If i were to find a fault it would be that the floor boards were very squeeky and so i did feel sorry for the guests below us when we walked in our room and also the room walls were rather thin and so you could here the other guests talking, all in all though a pleseant stay but after reading the other reviews i am glad that we upgraded our room!",4,2011,04,05
219,Good location but wouldn't stay there again,"Stayed at this hotel for one night at the end of March. It was in a good location near the centre of O'connell street with about a quarter of a mile walk there.

The hotel was not great. We had to move rooms once because our TV wouldn't work. Then when we did move; we only picked up one news channel.

There were constant trains moving outside the room so it was very noisy and it always sounded like the windows were open even though they weren't.

The room wasn't even clean.. Down the bedsides there was litter of all sorts including condom wrappers etc. Disgusting!

Breakfast was included in our price.. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. There was nothing for me to eat being a vegetarian except for egg and beans. The scrambled egg tasted like plastic. Even my husband who eats meat; said it was disgusting. Whilst sitting down eating; 3 leaks developed in the roof above us and when we told staff they simply put a bucket under it and left it there. They didn't seem to be fussed at all.

After a rubbish day our flight home wasn't until late afternoon and before we arrived they mentioned they had a room where we could leave our bags.. Unfortunately they failed to tell us that they charge 3 euros PER BAG!! Absolutley riducolous.. Most hotels offer this service for free!!

I will not be staying here again if I come to Dublin.",2,2011,04,01
219,"Helpful Staff, Average Accommodation",The staff here were very friendly but the hotel was not the most comfortable I've ever been in. The beds were so soft you sunk straight down into them and woke up with a sore back in the morning. The rooms were quite small and being right under a train line made it quite noisy at times. The breakfast was overpriced even though there was quite a lot on offer. I found it cheaper getting a big breakfast at the airport when we left to go home. It was a great location for the train station but a bit of a walk into the centre like O'Connell Street and Temple Bar area. I probably wouldn't go back to this hotel as I think you can find something better for your money.,3,2011,03,29
219,"Premier rooms nice, but I won't be back!","I have stayed in the North Star hotel a few times over the past few months whilst attending courses etc. I have been lucky enough to get good deals online for the premier rooms. The premier rooms are quite good, however, are not always that clean! The real issue in this hotel though, is the staff. I had booked for 3 different weekends in advance last December and I had paid a deposit, so I kept the bookings. However, each time I stayed here, I felt unwelcome. The staff were unfriendly and very unwilling to help if I had a request/query. I had to request internet codes each day to use the wifi...each time I was told ""right, hold on""! Whilst the premier rooms are good and the club lounge a bonus, I won't be back...I rather stay somewhere else where I actually feel welcome!",2,2011,03,27
219,Very Satisfied with stay,"Having read mixed reviews before I went about rooms below the 5th floor not  being very good I was a bit wary when we were allocated a 1st floor room. The twin room was comfortable and clean. Apart from the TV being a bit old and knobs had fallen off it was still in working order. The buffet breakfast was excellent as were the waiting staff being attentive at all times. The concierge was very helpful and welcoming and was a fountain of knowledge re buses and directions. The reception staff always acknowledged us as we passed by the desk. We were there for St. Patrick‚Äôs Day which was a bit manic with children in the main foyer on the day but they cleared the bar for a short time in the evening to ensure the children went out. The food in the bar and the main restaurant was acceptable although the prices more expensive than the ""sample menu"" on the web-site. There was no early bird menu at Biaconis either. My mother‚Äôs steak was rather gristly so the waitress made amends by offering us free deserts and tea/coffee. 
I had read reports about unsavoury characters hanging around the hotel but for the 4 nights we stayed did not see any of this. Only criticism is that there is no where for coaches to drop off at peak times and we had to drag our cases from around the corner on the next street.",4,2011,03,19
219,Customer Service Tainted What Could Have Been a Lovely Hotel,"I just returned from my trip to Ireland where I stayed at the North Star Hotel for 7 nights. Upon checking in, we were treated almost as if we weren't valued guests because we booked through Expedia instead of directly-- even though we were staying for 7 nights, not one or two! My philosophy would be: if you don't want people booking through Expedia or other travel services, don't make that option available! I have never seen services denied to a customer because of who they book through.

In addition, the customer service at the hotel was atrocious. I am fairly confident that none of the front desk staff bothered to even look up at us when we walked through the lobby, even though we would greet them with friendly ""hello's."" I don't recall any of them smiling at any point during the stay. The first greetings (and smiles) we received were on day 5--from the housekeeper. Pretty sad for a company that is based entirely on dealing with the public. 

They charge 5Euro an hour for the internet. I would suggest going around the corner to a small internet cafe that charges only 1Euro an hour. 

The hotel was located directly across from Connolly Station. This was helpful as we took train trips to Galway and Belfast. We also took the DART to Howth, and the LUAS connects here as well. The proximity of this station is a major asset to the hotel. The hotel is also within walking distance of Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, and Grafton Street. All of these walks were 15-20 minutes or less. Just to mention, when our cab driver  dropped us off, he told us not to take a left out of the hotel to go for a walk as it was an unsafe area. Most attractions were towards the right, so we never encountered any problems.

The rooms were clean and comfortable. We were on the 3rd floor, and had the DART rails directly behind our window. However, I had no trouble sleeping, and could barely notice when they were running. If you are a light sleeper, I would suggest bringing ear plugs. Sheets were washed once during our one week stay--I could tell because one untucked corner stayed there until our final night. There were also a few holes in the duvet cover. The bathroom was clean. However, our shower door didn't latch closed so the floor would flood every time we took a shower. The toilet also didn't flush easily--you'd often need to try 2 or 3 times before it would finally work. These are all relatively minor things that I most likely would have looked past happily had the customer service not put me in such a foul mood. Again, cleanliness was never an issue--the housekeepers do a marvelous job!

We were given a smoking room even though I requested an unsmoking, but I'm assuming this is because I booked through Expedia. The hallways stink of cigarette smoke, so if you have asthma, I would be weary of staying here.

The hotel has two restaurants attached -- McCoy's Pub and Bianconi's Restaurant. After a long day, my boyfriend and I just wanted a cup of coffee and dessert. Upon entering Bianconi's, the hostess rudely informed us that if we wanted to do that, we'd have to go to McCoy's pub, even though dessert and coffee were on the menu. We obliged and walked across the hallway to McCoy's. We sat at a table and were ignored for over 20 minutes. Finally, I walked up to the bartender to order a slice of Bailey's cheesecake, a cappuccino, and a latte. After ordering, our waitress had to be summoned by the bartender to actually get us everything. She gave us no bill, just told us verbally that we owed 10Euro. Bothered by the lack of quality customer service yet again, I told her I actually owed her 9.30 Euro. Again, I normally wouldn't quibble over 70cents, but I was fed up with the poor customer service in every aspect of this hotel. 

I would definitely recommend finding another place to stay while in Dublin. It's a shame that what could have been a lovely, clean, affordable hotel in a good location was tainted by the worst customer service I have ever experienced in North America, Central America, Europe, and Asia.",2,2011,03,16
219,EXCELLENT,"We stayed here for one night as we had a concert in the O2, Excellent location and the food in the restaurant was second to none,  will definatly be back.",5,2011,03,13
219,good and not so good.,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights- bed and breakfast and one evening meal was included. The hotel is in a fantastic area and is only a shot walk to the shops. We arrived early and even although check in wasn't until 2pm we got in to our room early which was fantastic. I felt the room was quite grubby and needed a good clean and decorated again, the bedding was very worn, lumpy pillows and the single bed the duvet cover was ripped. each day our beds got made and the bathroom a quick going over. 

 We had our meal in the hotel on the first night, the service was really bad, we waited an hour on our starter that the waitress forgot to order! everything went down hill from there and the food was really not up to standard. Breakfast on the other hand was fantastic! very fresh and the service was fantastic!

As you come in to the hotel there is a desk right outside the bar and beside the staircase- there was a man who sold all the tickets to the main attractions- he was fantastic! and you got a discount on things - he is well worth a visit. We also purchased a 3 day rambler ticket for 13.30 euro each for using on the Dublin Bus - well worth it if your sight seeing you can use if as much as you want for 3 days it included all areas of dublin so this was our main source of transport. We purchased these at the Tourist Info at the airport. 

I wouldn't really recommend this hotel as i didn't feel it was clean enough or friendly enough and i feel there are far better hotels out there. 

I hope this review helps you in your choice of hotel . Dublin is a fantastic place to visit but very expensive 2 alcoholic drinks coming in at between ¬£10-¬£15 so take lots of pennys and enjoy! :)",2,2011,03,08
219,I would not recommend this hotel,"I stayed here for one night with my mother for  a concert. I booked this hotel through the hotels website. The pictures on the website are not a true representation of the rooms in the hotel. We stayed on the ground floor. I have heard the 5th floor and above is OK. The room was not clean. There was dust in the corners, the carpet was not clean and when I pulled the bedside locker out to find a plug I noticed there was an empty juice box and ketchup packet on the floor, the room had obviously not been cleaned thoroughly. We did not have a good night sleep - the matresses and pillows were very hard and the walls are paper thin so we could hear people talking and coming and going. The staff at breakfast were friendly and helpful. A continental breakfast was included with our room but I felt the selection was not very good - tinned fruit, cereal, toast and custard yoghurts. The location is a plus for this hotel - very close to the Luas and Connolly station. The O2 arena would take about 25 minutes to walk, the luas will drop you directly outside the O2. Overall, I would not stay here again and I would not recommend it to a friend.",2,2011,02,23
219,Car parking not as advertised,"Hotel itself was fine. Clean and bedroom newly refurbished.  However the car park is a different story! Prior to booking I rang and confirmed with the hotel that it had a car park.  However on my arrival I was informed that the hotel did not own the car park and that my car keys had to be left with the guys in the car park.  This really annoyed me especially due to my previous phone to ensure no problems would occur. When I went to pay the ‚Ç¨7.50 car park charge, I was then informed that it was ‚Ç¨9.  ‚Ç¨7.50 was only till 11.00, even though check out is 11.30. The area that this hotel is located in is not the best especially during night time hours.",3,2011,02,20
219,False Hopes,"When I was looking for hotels in Dublin for me and my boyfriend to stay in my first port of call was the internet.  The hotels website is really nice and depicts the image as being very modern and well kept.  The images on the website do not show the true context of the hotel.  The room we were given was very dated, and did not have all of the tv channels that were said to be on offer (not a great problem as we were out most of the time).  The bathroom is what really let the room down for us.  We are both quite tall and if you are over 5'9"" there is no way you will fit under the shower and there is no option to adjust it (amienties were poorly kept refreshed as well).  Breakfast was said to be 5.95 euros on the website however when we got there it was 9.95 euros and really not worth it, the staff were not at all friendly either!  We decided after the first day to go to a cafe for breakfast which was just around the corner and really nice.  Also room service food is disgusting! Do not recommend! However the cleanliness of the rooms could not be faulted and they will let you check your bags in if your room is not ready.  There is a bus that takes you into the centre from the airport and then a taxi to the hotel is only about 6 euros, you could easily walk to the centre from the hotel and it would take you about 20 minutes.  All in all for the value of the room i might think about staying here again but would possibly upgrade to one their 'premier' more expensive rooms but would still def not have any food from here!",3,2011,02,15
219,Amazing hotel could not fault anything great value!!!,"Well just had the most amazing weekend in dublin and the hotel made even more enjoyable room was gorgeous staff very friendly could,nt fault anything at all great value for what i paid.If i was returning to dublin i would choose the north star again. Breakfast was good bar staff were lovely and the man who greeted you when you came in to the hotel was lovely. So i would just like to say a huge thank you to the north star hotel and staff for making our stay so enjoyable than you very much!!!! Kirsty+Liam Chapman.",5,2011,02,13
219,Great Hotel,"I stayed here with my husband on the17th - 19th Jan and it was perfect. We stayed in the top floor premier club suites and the room was excellent. Our room was massive with a spacious bathroom and both where very clean and tidy. We had a view of the train station which is directly across the street, despite this we didn't hear much train noise nor traffic from the street. The bed was my husband favorite part of the break away. Very comfortable as he slept everytime he sat down on it. I have to say though excellent bed best sleep I've had staying in a hotel. 
First night we eat out plenty of choice all around the hotel something for everyone. However the second night we eat in the hotel bar excellent good portions and nice friendly barman.
Recomend anyone who has never taken the Croke park tour do - highlight of our breakaway. Tour was excellent.",5,2011,02,08
219,"Good hotel, polite staff, just a few niggles","Myself and partner stopped here from Friday 28th-Sunday 30 th January! Flight over was fine, getting to the hotel was also ok, we took a bus from the airport which cost 12 euro between us. Finding the hotel was easy. We got into the hotel for about 10.00am, the room was not ready, which was understandable as check in wasn't till 2.00pm but the receptionist told us to come back at 12. She was very helpful, stored out bags and directed us to Graingers place, which was delightful, we had a full Irish breakfast which cost 8 euro each and was delightful. My other half drunk guiness and i watched the tennis until check in time.

The room was fine, we had a double and a single bed, though we only slept in the double, which was uber comfortable. The room was clean, only a couple of niggles which were the lock on the bathroom door did not work and the window in the living space was a bit temperamental, other than those, tiny things, the room was lovely. Best bath i have ever had in a hotel, water was piping hot.

Some people have complained about the noise, we didn't hear a thing and i am a really light sleeper, only thing that worried us was when we checked in at reception a train went past and everything rumbled, we thought a dub set rave  was going on, however, we didn't hear a sound of it in our room (248, i think)

Staff were really friendly and helpful, the bar was really cosy, the outside was also really nice and clean, ideal if your a smoker.

My final niggle was that the hotel offers a shuttle bus to the airport which costs 4.50 euro single journey. We caught the 9.10, as our flight was at 10.50, however this service picks up at lots of other hotels and goes round in one massive circle, you will be taken past the hotel again before you get to the airport! lol! We were quite worried as we thought we were going to miss our flight, but we made it! One woman did ask the driver if we were going to the airport, or having a sight seeing tour of Dublin. But we got there, so its all good.

So in conclusion this is a nice, decent hotel, in walking distance to temple bar/street/row (10/15mins) Rooms are in good nick, staff are friendly and very helpful. I would stay here again!

 When you go to temple bar/street/row you have to go into quays bar/pub! Its fantastic authentic Irish atmosphere with different performers on throughout the day.

Good price, Good rooms, Friendly helpful staff, Good distance to centre of things and Good laugh!",4,2011,02,06
219,Run Down Shack with No Captain on Board,"I stayed here for two nights and i must say was a really run down Shack,
The place was filthy, My room was a disgrace it was like been in a Run Down Hostel 
 Managment would not entertain anything i was complaing about, 
The front office Manager was a Joke who kept arguing and would not listen to what i was saying apparently he is teh duty manager too

I asked to speak to the own er but was told he does not do complaints",1,2011,02,06
219,Fantastic top floor room and great bed!,"BF and I were part of a big tour group.  All of us stayed on the top floor suites and we were all pleased.  BF and I had a king room and spacious bathroom.  We had a view of the city train station and even if it was across the street, we didnt hear any train nor traffic on the streets.  The bed was my favorite part of my stay.  Very comfortable- I slept very well despite the jetlag.  The hotel is 3 blocks from the major bus station that can take you to the airport cheaper than if u take a cab.  The front desk staff are helpful and will gladly point out places in the map that you can take once you check in.  The breakfast room is in the basement and has no windows nor ventilation.  The variety is good but it is dark and feels closed-in.  One problem I have with the hotel is that the check-in area is in sort of a 2nd floor and if you have a heavy luggage, you have to carry it about 15 steps on the semi-winding stairs (didn't notice an elevator- so I imagine guests with disabilities might not like to stay here).  Also, there is a lounge with only 1 computer and pricey internet access.  If you're in a hurry and need to print a boarding pass and there's a guest using the computer, good luck!

The location of this hotel with respect to the downtown area of Dublin is a good 10-15 minutes walk.  There are great pubs around the hotel, a Subway, a really nice mediterranean restaurant around the corner plus a convenience store for stuff like bottled water, donuts or candy.

Tip: If you like coffee and want to stay away from Starbucks, do not leave Dublin without a stop at one of the Butler's Chocolate Cafes.  There's one in the airport and several in the city center.  I really really love their chocolates and cafe lattes and moccaccinos.",3,2011,02,05
219,Only stay on fifth floor or above!,"My husband and I booked an executive double room for two nights. When we checked in  we were given a room with three beds so close to each other you could barely move.  One of the beds was right up against the window. The paint was peeling away from the window sill and there was a portable tv in the room - not the 28"" flat screen advertised.
We complained and were moved to another room.  This was no better! The double bed's springs had completely gone!  This was apparent even just from looking at it and should have been reported by Housekeeping staff!  (totally unsuitable) The interior was every bit as shabby as room one. Peeling paint and general drabness!  It looked as though it hadn't be decorated for years!
My husband went down once again to Reception. Finally, we were given a room which matched the advertised description.  Apart from a squeeky floorboard, this room was lovely!! From the moment we stepped out of the lift on floor 5, it was obvious that this hotel has widely varying standards of rooms. 
Breakfast room was without a single widow which made the room feel claustrophobic, decor was really the worst I have ever seen. (fake library bookshelves wallpaper on all walls!!) The actual buffet breakfast was average enough.
Aside from these concerns, the location was good. (we were going to a show in the O2 which is only about 15 mins walk ) If you don't fancy walking its a short hop on the Luas which can be got just around the corner.  Also very convenient to Connolly Station.
In this day and age I feel that WI Fi should be free and not three euro for twenty mins!
In short don't stay on any floor below five!! Definitely not floor four where we had the misfortune to be placed originally.",3,2011,01,31
219,Nice and clean,"I stayed with two friends in a room on the 2nd floor at the back of the hotel. The room was large and clean and had three really big beds. The view from the room was nothing special but if you go higher in the hotell the view of Dublin is really nice.

Location was ok. Close to local transports and within walking distance (15 min) of Temple Bar and other spots.

We didn't try the breakfast or the restaurant but other people in our company did and they said it was ok. If you don't want to have breakfast at the hotel there are several pubs in the area serving breakfast.

The only negative thing is that you have to pay extra for internet access.",4,2011,01,30
219,Great stay,My friend and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the North Star. We had a lovely time. Our room was great. We booked a premier club twin at a reasonable price and were very pleased. We had access to the club lounge but only really used it for lovely hot chocolate and biscuits .The staff are all lovely and friendly and your concierge was a delight .Everywhere to go is in walkable distance and after filling up on a large breakfast off we went. There is a convenient airport shuttle both ways as well.Nice that the manager seated us for breakfast andthat his staff all say great things about him. We will be recommending you to our friends  Thanks Jane and Jen,4,2011,01,30
219,"""I'm sorry, our hands are tied...","""I'm sorry, our hands are tied"" was the common words I heard from the staff (and management) at North Star Hotel. A friend and I had spent some time traveling in Europe and were finishing in Dublin. Because of the snow our flight from Barcelona to Dublin was cancelled meaning we were missing a night at the hotel that we paid for. Once we left the airport in Barcelona I immediately phoned the front desk to inquire about what we should do. The man on the phone ensured us that the hotel would be flexible and that there was no need to change/cancel our room. The following morning we left Barcelona and were diverted to Cork. Then a long shuttle ride through the snow up to Dublin. We arrived at the hotel late. Upon check-in I inquired about the unused paid night. The manager on duty (Damien) informed me that there was no refund that could be given. He was unwilling to upgrade the room, provide wireless internet (even though promised free on website), or breakfast (again, promised free on website). He was unwilling to make any concessions for the missed night and misinformation provided by the man on the telephone. 

The rest of the stay was unpleasant. Things that were promised on the hotel's website (hairdryer, trouser press, internet, etc.) were never actually given. The management staff were unhelpful. I requested the contact information of the General Manger, but they were unwilling to give me his contact email address. I wrote a letter to the General Manger (Brian) and never received a response. The letter has been sent multiple times, yet nothing. Either the hotel staff are keeping it from him, or there is a lack of desire to respond. Regardless the stay and staff were unimpressive. 

There are PLENTY of smaller Bed and Breakfasts nearby that would be happy to have your business. If I hadn't paid I would have moved onto another location.",1,2011,01,13
219,Excellent,"We stayed here for 5 nights while doing day trips from Dublin.  The Hotel was excellent. We stayed on the Club Floor and could not fault it. The room was large with king bed. The club lounge is not what you may expect, but it was great to be able to get Hot chocolate and coffees whenever you wanted. Biscuits and bottled water also available most of the time. Postion was close to the bus,  train and trams, but a little out of town.    If ever returning to Dublin would definately stay here again.",5,2011,01,09
219,Average Hotel with friendly staff.,"Arrived at the hotel. Warm greeting and swift booking in. 
The reception area & residents lounge smelled very musty as if there had been a burst pipe or leak. With the tempeture around these areas very warm it was apparent the carpets were being dried.
The room on entering had an overpowering smell of smoke. Our friend‚Äôs room was the same & after complaining were moved. The room itself was clean & tidy. The mattress was a bit worn but not too bad & a good night sleep was achieved. 
The bar attached to the hotel was fine. The breakfast was good but had a bit of a control freak serving us who also shouted at my friend when she went to use the toast machine telling her we already had toast on our table. After telling him our toast was cold he then brought us a plate of warm slices.
The hotel is quite central & is about a 20-30 min walk to the Temple Bar area or 10 euro in a taxi. The area around the hotel is fine with some very friendly local bars were you can sample a ""TRUE"" pint of the black stuff!",3,2010,12,31
219,Do not stay if you wish to be put in a bad mood!!,"fist of all i must say the room was lovely with two single beds for myself and my friend apart from stains I saw on the throw over the bed. They were very high off the ground, one mattress on top of another, so it may be difficult for a person with reduced mobility, or for someone who had one drink too many!!! We got lunch in the Irish bar attached to the hotel earlier in the day and the man serving us was lovely and friendly and the food was nice.
we came back from a concert that night and were very hungry and did not want to leave the hotel because we had heard from several people that the street that the hotel is on is very dangerous, so get a taxi after dark. There was late night food on offer in the hotel so myself and my friend went down to the lounge, I agree with other reviews about the smell in the lounge, very overpowering. Next i can ony describe was an encounter with the most ignorant and rude person i have ever met. I went up to the reception and the man behind the desk took my order. He was so short and rude that I felt as if we were an inconvenience to him. when the food came, salad sandwich and a hot dog, they were on the one plate, which is not only unhygienic but very offputting for my friend eating the sandwich (she is a vegetarian). He threw the food down and wanted impatiently as we got our money together. in the meantime a group, who had just checked in, came into the lounge looking for food. They were foreign travellers and I was embarrassed by how rude this man was to them, as a proud irish person, I think tourism is key to our survival and having ignorant people looking after our tourists is a disgrace.
The final nail in the coffin was when I emailed the hotel complaining about this man and they never replied. They obviously dont care about their customers or who they have working for them and therefore i would not recommend you stay here.",2,2010,12,21
219,Had a fantastic stay!Great value!,"Having stayed at the north star on a number of occassions, we decided to book a premier suite for our stay in June. The room was spotless as was the bathroom, bed comfy and loads of space. Only problem was getting in to members lounge with our room key but staff on our floor were more than helpful in letting us in. Would recommend this place to anyone. Particulary good for over night stays. Am looking forward to staying at north star after Christmas with my whole family.",5,2010,12,02
219,Stay somewhere else,"I was really let down by my stay in the North Star Hotel and feel mislead by there website. The lobby had a smell of damp, we had to be moved room as our window would not close-on one of the coldest nights of the year, we had booked one of the executive rooms-no possible way could it be described as that, there was no restaurant open-we had dinner included in our package but had to have it in the bar instead-nobody had advised  us on booking, We went to the O2 and returned to the bar for a drink but were led to the residents bar which is actually a mini fridge located in a room upstairs.",2,2010,11,30
219,Nice hotel,"Stayd at The North Star hotel for 3 nights, nothing to complain about.

Check in/out was quick and right.
Rooms was ok, clean and quiet.

Was central but we needed to take a lot of taxi to get to the shopping/nightlife.",4,2010,11,29
219,Wrong rooms...twice!,"We arrived late at night at the Hotel, that is exactly in front of the central train station and tram-line stop. The receptionist gave us the key to the room: 2nd floor with no elevator and old stairs. The room was smaller than the one we booked (in July!) and had stained bedspreads and a really old and crumbling bathroom. So we went down to the Hall and asked to the receptionist to check if there was some mistake. She actually agreed that we sholud have a bigger and newer room in the new part of the hotel but they were all occupied!  She tried to give us another room...with mold on the ceiling! After spending the first night in the first room we were moved to the new part of the hotel. The new room was better, bigger and cleaner but not as good as in the photos on the website. 
They didn't apologize nor offer us the first night.
I won't go back!",2,2010,11,28
219,Clean and comfortable Premier rooms in good location,"We stayed for 3 nights and found the premier rooms to be large, clean and comfortable, especially the bed. Good location with only 10 minutes to temple bar. You could hear the trains, but you get used to them and they do stop during the night! Would recommend - good value.",4,2010,11,16
219,a Quaint hotel worth the vist!!,"at first sight this hotel seemed dark and old! but in fact the hotel had many surprises! the rooms, at the back of the bulding were immaculately contemporary! considering the first impressions looked like it was athrow back from the 80's! but it was kool in that kind of sense! the hotel had all mod cons better than expected!! 

the rooms were cosy and comfortable, and clean! beds were memory foam mattresses!!...ahhh..pure bliss!!  

the breakfast was 10euros per person, but it was an all u can eat buffet which would set u up for the whole day!

there was a quaint little irish pub linked to the hotel itself, with an smoking area @ the back, all heated, including tv which you can watch whilst enjoying a bevvy!

there was a top restaurant in the hotel too... food could have been better, but service was definately tops!

staff were really friendly on the whole there! no complaints, as they met to our need the best as they could! 

all in all, i can defiantley say i would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, and i would surely go back to stay in it again!! :))",5,2010,11,05
219,"Nothing Special, but Okay","Be prepared to carry your own luggage up to the 2nd floor, where the service desks are.
Staff was friendly and helpful.  Service was good.  I wasn't impressed with the hotel.  Sketchy neighbourhood.  I wouldn't have felt safe walking in this neighbourhood after dark.  Rooms were noisy, alot of trains.  The best view was when the curtains were drawn.  Our room on the 7th floor looked out onto train tracks.  My daughters were on the 2nd floor their view was of a lower roof top and garbage.  The rooms were clean, but nothing special.   They didn't measure up to the pics on their website.  I would rate this place as ""okay"".",3,2010,11,04
219,Brilliant Stay!,We arrived at the hotel at 11pm and we were met by a friendly young man who checked us in and we were shown to our rooms 662 and 670. Our rooms were just lovely modern and the bed was sooo comfortable.The bathroom was also very modern and clean. The staff in the restaurant at breakfast on both days were friendly and attentive- and we all enjoyed the food- yes it is a buffet and there aren't many places where you can actually get a soft fried egg! The bacon was delicious.Admittedly we did pay a few euros more for our rooms but it was well worth it.I would definetly stay there again.,4,2010,10,29
219,"average, and a bit gloomy...","we were booked at the north star following an overbooking debacle at a local b&b.  being as the marathon was that day we were happy to have a place to sleep.  

the lobby is chic and makes you think the rooms are going to be cool as well, they arent.  walking thru the access door from the lobby to the rooms was truly turning a corner. suddenly the floors were sagging, wallpaper peeling and carpets very worn.  (maybe they are in the process of updating the rest of the hotel?)  but all this is asthetics.  the location is fairly central.  central to connelly station--this is convenient but noisy until about 11pm, be warned.  our bathroom was a bit yucky.  it kind of felt like it needed a good dousing with bleach to remove the mold and water deposits :(

the staff was great!  i feel bad writing what seems to be a bad review because the girl at the front desk was especially nice.  overall the rooms just need a good once over, new carpet and new wallpaper.  but for the money its acceptable.",3,2010,10,27
219,Good Hotel centrally located,"This hotel was good the staff were extremeley helpful and friendly and the hotel was centrally located across the road from the train station and a 10 minute walk to temple bar. The room i stayed it was your usual standard hotel room but my friends were upgraded to the Premier Suites and if i had stayed there i would have gave the hotel a 4 star rating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good cheap, central hotel.

One annoyance was having to pay for Wi Fi.",3,2010,10,26
219,Average hotel centrally located,For the price we paid breakfast service was generally grumpy and rooms were poor quality with lots of noise making sleep a real challenge,3,2010,10,22
219,Nice location,"Hotel was clean, your lower end room is either on the lower floor or 2nd floor.  Try to get a room away from the elevator as our friends had one next to it and after just arriving from a flight, it was a noisy room.  Went to the desk and they accommodated them on the 2nd floor away from the elevator.  Rooms are clean and comfortable with tea and coffee making in your room.  Bathrooms are small.  We didn't spend a lot of time in the room so it worked for us.  If you can upgrade to a better room I would do it.  Our rate did not include breakfast, but we found a store on the corner where we could buy croissants and goodies.",3,2010,10,20
219,"ENJOYABLE STAY, GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY!","Recently stayed at the North Star for 2 nights and stayed in one of the executive rooms. We had shopped around for a good deal on the hotel and must say we got good value for money and the rooms were very comfortable. The bed extremely comfortable!  I had read the other reviews about the noise from the train station nearby but have to say did not notice this at all but this could be down to where the room was located. Staff were pleasant and very helpful. Hotel bar McCoys had a great atmosphere and reasonably priced. The hotel itself is well located, we got off the airport bus at the bus station and the hotel was only a few minutes walk. Also a 10 minute walk to the 'Spire' on O'Connell Street. Would definitely stay here again!",4,2010,10,18

219,The hotel was very good. Don't take any notice of the bad reviews,"The hotel was generally very good. We had a warm welcome and the staff throughout our stay were helpful. Our room-which was a twin on the lower floor was clean, neat and in good condition.  The location was excellent near to the centre and convienient both for the trains and buses.  I don't know where the people stayed who have written the bad reviews-I think they must have been staying in a different hotel to me!!",4,2010,10,15
219,Not the place for business tracellers.,"This place had some ups and downs. It was clean and had pleasant appearance, however, the beds are absolutely awful. The train goes past right over the building and is so loud. A few of the receptionists were lovely, especially the young Brazilian woman who was so accommodating. However, the night receptionist, a young man was absolutely horrible. He was never at the desk, and was so rude.He refused to do anything for you, and would argue about everything; even at one point refusing to get us some towels. Internet was 13.95 a day, which was not made clear when we booked. And to top matters off, it never worked. As business travelers, internet is vital, and we spent the entire day losing work and stressing about internet. It was atrocious for the price they are charging. The location was quite good, very close to public transport, however a little on the outskirts of the centre of town- about a 10-15 minute walk to the real town centre. Also would like to mention that the concierge was very helpful.",2,2010,10,08
219,"Hotel good, carpark awful!!","Stayed in hotel on a Sunday night. When entering hotel carpark approached by man who said he parked the cars, checked this with reception and they confirmed this was the process. Advised man in carpark that we were leaving early on Monday am.
Premier room good size and decor but ""machine"" noise right through the night.  Monday morning went to carpark to find car was parked behind 5 other cars, we were advised that it would be ready in 10 minutes, this although disappointing seemed fair enough.  IT TOOK 90 MINUTES TO GET CAR AND MAN TOLD US WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL HE ""LET US PARK THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE"" even though we had paid for the space!!!",2,2010,09,21
219,Would have got more sleep in my car!!!!,"I had 2 rooms as the first one leaked when it rained (214) the 2nd room 101 should not be allowed to be used as a bedroom!!!!! meeting room, play room anything but a bedroom. This is due to the fact the railway line runs more or less over the room, & when a train (which run until midnight & start again at 6am) pass by the whole room shakes!!!!! In the quiet time in between trains you get a constant drone of music from the lobby. I stay in a lot of hotels due to my job & I look at a lot of hotels from 2 star up & this is probably the worst experience I have had since toad lodge in Bristol. My next trip to Dublin will involve a different hotel.",1,2010,09,20
219,Not as bad as it is made out to be,"I booked into this hotel with very low expectations after reading many reviews on trip advisor. It started on a bad note when I reached the check in desk at 1.30 and was informed that I will have to wait until 2 to check in or pay Euro 10 for checking in early. I would have been more at ease if they didn't give me the Euro 10 option. But I decided to wait for another 30 minutes to save Euro 10 - but then spent it at the bar downstairs during the time. However, the hotel offered to take care of the luggage free while we waited for 2pm. There was a queue at 2pm for checking in with the staff trying hard to manage the rush.
Friendly staff 

Positives:
1. Great room, spacious for a city center hotel, very clean and tidy
2. The bed was fantastic, very comfy
3. Big TV, but I hardly used it
4. parking is free - great for city centre!
5. The location is right at the city center. The spire is a 2 minutes walk. Right beside Luas, Dart and the Northern side train services.
6. Decent decor

To Improve:
1. The shower handle came off when i tried to turn it on.. i fixed it myself..
2. you could hear the trains rumbling.. but it isn't too bad...unless you can sleep only in complete silence
3. No lift from the entrance to the reception.. i saw a few elderly people struggling there..
4. You should allow at least 30 minutes leverage for people to check in early than charging Euro 10 for the privilege
5. The door locking system stopped working and i couldn't enter my room at about 10 at night..  The phone outside on the 4th floor was not working, so i had to walk all the way to the reception. However, the reception apologized and was very helpful.Called a guy immediately who fixed it. Another bad memory for me.

If you want a place to sleep for exploring the city - this is just perfect. For me, staying just the night,  this was just fine. The sound of the trains were feeble and did not bother me.  But if you are looking for a place to meditate and relax and spend a lot of time in the hotel, you might find better places outside the city.",3,2010,08,13
219,"Good location, comfortable, would stay again","Having read other reviews we booked the premier club room, excellent quality, downside at night we had to close the windows due to the adjacent railway. With the window closed there was no noise and the room had air conditioning. 
Our room rate did not include breakfast, to buy a breakfast we had to purchase a voucher from reception each morning, a strange system that could be improved. The breakfast buffet was good value, but they need to relocate the serving tongs for the hot food and not leave them constantly under the hot lamps, you need oven gloves to pick up food, I wasn't sure if this was to put guests off taking too many portions.  
The location is very good, over the road from Connolly station so handy for the Dart and the Luas.",5,2010,08,10
219,Slightly expensive for the money but overall average service and reasonably good location.,"The North Star is easy to get to from the airport. Just catch the bus from the airport and it drops you off right outside, only 6 Euros one way. Also the hotel is opposite Connolly train station. Great if you want to escape the city for the day and hop on the Dart to somewhere like Howth, a lovely quiet seaside resort. But again, a hotel next to a train station...there was some noise but it was minimal. From the hotel it would take about 15 to 20 minutes to walk into the city centre i.e. tourist attractions and Temple Bar. Overall cleanliness off the room could have been better. There were marks and stains on the walls. We did get room service every day with clean sheets and towels. We didn't eat in the hotel as there are quite a few bars and restaurants near by that were much cheaper.

We paid around ¬£43 per person per night. If you can find it cheaper then go for it but other  wise have a look around.",3,2010,07,31
219,Nice hotel in a decent location,"Nice hotel in a decent location - We stayed in one of the premier rooms and the bed was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in!
Restaurant and bar were nice, facilities were good.
This hotel is near enough to temple bar to walk and far enough away that if you drink local to the hotel you dont have top pay the rip off prices associated with temple bar.
I would happily stay here again and recommend my friends.",4,2010,07,30
219,Great Dublin City Centre Value Hotel,Just a 5 minute walk from Connelly Street Bus Station & Luas tram line.  We stayed in family room which consisted of 1 double bed & 2 single beds.  Room was very clean & breakfast was lovely.  Train passes hotel but this was not heard in room.  Staff were helpful & friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel as good value for money.,4,2010,07,25
219,Nice hotel. Would recommend premier club suite.,"Stayed in the premier suite. Great location for Dublin City Centre as right in front of connolly tran station. Tram line ran behind hotel and our room looked out onto same. Noisy with patio doors open during the day but noise didnt pose a problem for sleeping at night. Air con a little nosey too but at least it was there as room was very warm on arrival. Room clean, decore nice, bathroom very modern, shower was great and bed extremely comfortable and huge. Tv only had rte 1 and 2 and took ages to turn on and switch between channels. Had fridge in the room which was excellent to store beverages as dublin is very expensive for drinking out in the bars. Hotel staff were pleasant although no information was provided on check in about sauna, gym facilities etc. Restaurant food was nice and they did a lovely peppered sauce for the steak. Hotel bar was very old fasioned but a nice atmosphere nonetheless.",4,2010,07,20
219,"Hotel good , staff not so good!","I was going to Dublin for the weekend to see a football match at Croke park and chose to stay at the North Star Hotel due to its good location to Croke park, Connolly station and we got a good deal on-line.  We stayed in one of the premier club rooms and it was lovely, the bed was really comfortable however the room was absolutely roasting and the air conditioning was really loud.  On the day of check out the cleaners entered our room at 9am before realising that we had not yet checked out.  They returned at 11am and made us feel that we had to leave early even though check out was not until 12pm.  We ate in the restaurant on the Saturday evening however service was quite slow and not very friendly.  Our meal was OK though neither of our steaks were cooked to our liking and the potatoes seemed like they had been sitting a while before being served.  Overall I was impressed with the room however felt hotel staff let the hotel down.",3,2010,07,18
219,nice stay at the north star hotel,"We stayed at the North Star for 3 nights and although not everything went flawless, we were satisfied with our stay. Don't be shocked by the street view, because you might have the impression that a train runs through the middle of the hotel, which it does more or less. It's essential to book the premier club room, since they're in a separate block behind the original and old hotel entrance. The room we were initially given was an executive room, so I had to go back to the reception and ask for the premium club room we had booked. This was quickly rectified by the friendly receptionist and the room itself was very nice, far better than the other, more basic rooms!
It was modern, spacious, clean and quiet with all the facilities we needed (safe, fridge, AC). Breakfast was better than average and in general, staff was quite friendly.
If you want to be right in the centre of the city, this might not be the ideal hotel, since it's a 15 minute walk to city centre, but it didn't really bother us. However, the location is excellent to take the airlink bus to and from the airport.
The pub next to the hotel was ok, but nothing special. All in all, a nice hotel, but be sure to take the premium club rooms!",4,2010,07,14
219,You can do better,"We were not impressed with the North Star Hotel. They were understaffed and the concierge wasn't overly helpful and worse, he gave us the wrong directions for an art gallery. We were upgraded to one of the hotel's new rooms because of a mistake on the part of the hotel. This was a blessing in disguise because the standard rooms are tired and also they appear to be quite popular with party-goers. The room we ended up with was recently renovated, but the renovations were clearly done on the cheap. The caulking around the tub was already gone and the grout in the bathroom tiles was coming out. The hotel wasn't cheap either, and it's good walk from the city centre proper. A continental breakfast was included, which was very basic, but what we expected. In fairness, the hotel is really handy to Connolly Station and the reception staff are doing their best, which we appreciated. The bed we had was a king, and it was super comfortable and our room had a good size deck which you could access. This was a nice treat. We wouldn't stay here again though, and you can find a better hotel that's closer, and likely much nicer for the same price.",2,2010,06,18
219,ok. Nothing great but no complaints,"Used by people going to the O2. Run a bus usually for big concerts but we walked short distance to end of road and got a tram after quick pint in Katies corner. Quick and easy going - but massive crowds trying to get tram on way home.
The hotel was fairly basic compared with what I read. Clean enough with maids every day, but nothing great.
Location for O2 is good but its not in a great area next to railway bridge and main road.",3,2010,06,01
219,"Not good, not bad","I booked this hotel, 'cause I founded an offer on a famous last minute web site: they offer 3 nights at the price of 2, and 3 nights were just what I was looking for.
The hotel it's just on the railway station but no particular noises was heard and the situation wasn't dangerous.

When I arrived the reception didn't recognize the 3x2 offer, so they wanted I pay for 3rd night. Absolutely not! We had a little discussion and finally all get well.
The Room was very big, we were 2 of us, but we had 1 double bed and 2 twin bed, so 4 bed for 2 people. By the way, the room was not particularly dirt, but what I call clean is something else.
I don't think I'd return there.",3,2010,05,13
219,The Premier club rooms are fantastic!,"We read many bad reviews before going to Dublin which almost put us off this hotel but I am so glad we went!! Easily the comfiest bed I have ever slept in, great staff who brought us pizza at 2am, room cleaned very well every day of the stay. We stayed in a Premier club room which are the ones pictured on the website. They're right next to the train station but you can hardly hear the trains. Only 6 euros from the airport to Busaras Station which is right near the North Star - brilliant.",5,2010,04,01
219,Ripped Off with Breakfast Charges and No Refund Given !!!,"Stayed at the North Star Hotel, Dublin in October 2009 for 1 night after booking online through Failte Hotels. At the time of my initial booking I was quoted and charged for a room only, paying a deposit to Failte Hotels with the balance due to the North Star Hotel. I subsequently amended this to include a breakfast inclusive rate and got my initial deposit properly refunded. A deposit was again taken for my amended booking, however when I arrived at the Nort Star Hotel it refused to honour the breakfast inclusive rate, causing some embarassment at the reception desk. I didn't argue the toss at the time and chose to resolve this issue after my stay. Consequently my wife and I did not take breakfast or any other meals at the hotel. Having now been corresponding with both the North Star Hotel and Failte Hotels by email for some months, I still await my refunds totalling ‚Ç¨37.90 which I am now vigorously pursuing. I have to say that I have received an apology from the hotel regarding the incorrect actions of the reception staff who refused to honour my breakfast voucher, but I have also been blatanatly ignored and lied to over the promised refund by several individuals. All my recent emails sent with read a receipt have been unanswered and the attitude of both the North Star Hotel and Failte Hotels is rude and unprofessional. I won't book with either again and this is disappointing as I have stayed at this hotel before on previous trips to Dublin. On the plus side it is located not far from O'Connell Street and is handy for the O2 Arena. It is however very basic but served a function. The ignorant attitude of the employees I have experienced does little to enhance the reputation of both the hotel and Dublin and I won't be rushing back - Dublin is also becoming overpriced and greedy as evidence in a local bar (Malloy's) round the corner from the hotel who charges locals ‚Ç¨3 for a pint of Guinness but the tourist rate is almost doublt that !!! Rip Off : (",2,2010,03,23
219,Don't take the Gamble,"There is a possibility that you may get a newly renovated room, supposedly, but I would not even take the chance.  It was the most disgusting hotel we have ever stayed in.  If you like sleeping on a small rock with rock pillows then this place is for you.  Not sure what our view looked like due to the filthiness of our window.  Oh, and if you like cold showers with a babbling brook water pressure then this is the place for you!  I actually felt dirtier after getting out of the shower.  And the only way to get any sleep at night is to be completely intoxicated.  And be careful, the location is dodgy at best.  I think we almost got robbed or beat up by a bunch of kids!",1,2010,03,22
219,Hidden extras!,"We stayed in this hotel the weekend after Paddys day for a concert. We had booked an executive suite via the concert special advertised. When we arrived we had trouble finding the car park as it is not sign posted but when we did we were informed of the absolutely ridiculous parking rates! I would assume that most hotels provide parking for their guests.. especially at these rates! This information regarding the car parking facilities was not mentioned at the time of booking either. Staff were ok, not particularly interested in their customers but were friendly. We enquired about the Shuttle bus service to the O2 and it was not running.. another problem as we had booked the hotel on the grounds that this service was available, breakfast was buffet style and very good. Our ""executive room"" was average, nothing executive about it! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone as it is too expensive for what you get.",1,2010,03,21
219,Don't be misled by the name 'Premier Suites',"I stayed here over a Six Nations weekend. My room looked nothing like the pictures on the site. It was small, overheated, and there was a funny smell coming from the bathroom. It looked as if it had been refurbished about 20 years ago. The shower gave up and stopped working after 2 minutes of my shower.
It's true the trains did run about 20 yards from the window but I can't say they kept me awake.
Breakfast buffet was good, but it is served in a room with no windows.
Location is good, perhaps a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar and the city centre.",3,2010,03,16
219,Hotel lovely very homely,We found the hotel excellant.  The recptionest allowed us view room before taking payment.  The room was very clean and confortable.  Breakfast excellant.  Staff very friendly and helpful.,5,2010,03,11
219,Great Location,"Excellent hotel and great location.  It's good to get transfer to and from the airport for this hotel.  After you are at the hotel, it's across the street from the train station, down the block from the bus station and even close to Paddy Wagon Tours.  The staff was nice and the room was very comfortable.",4,2010,02,17
219,ok.,"We stayed at the North Star for my birthday. The entrance was ok and the lobby was very nice and modern and so was the hallway and then we walked into our room. It was nothing at all like the pictures on any off the web sites I have looked on. We booked a superior room and it was like stepping back in time. It was clean, but that‚Äôs all I would say.
We went down to reception to ask them if they knew we were meant to be staying in a superior room and they said this was, she was quite rude. So whatever you do, do not go for anything less that that. You are right next to the train station, but thankfully we could not hear it from our room.
The location was a bit rough; if you are by yourself I would not recommend this hotel. We saw a few fights break out.
Dublin however was fantastic. Guinness factory brilliant and so was the Jail. The red open top sightseeing buses were great and don‚Äôt be afraid to haggle as it is so so so expensive. Especially alcohol.
Great break away on the whole, just wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel.",2,2010,02,15
219,"Awful hotel, service and rooms","Although the hotel is based in the centre of Dublin giving easy access to shops and restaurants, this is where the positives end.

The hotel itself was awful.  The standard room which still cost ¬£150 for 3 nights was very old fashioned with a broken toilet seat, towels with holes in them (not to mention smelly!) and on top of that, we were next door to an extremely noisy couple.  When we complained at 1am, we were told that we were entitled to a room change but when we approached the staff the next day, we were told that should be no further issues as the noisy couple had moved out.  Guess what?  Not so, so our last night was filled with loud talking and shouting from the next room.  We were also close to the tram line so not only could we see the passing trams from our window, but we could hear them too.  Awful customer service and dingy hotel.  I would not recommend this to my worst enemy...on second thoughts....

Avoid at your own peril!",1,2010,02,13
219,Like two hotels in one - one being terrible!,"We booked this hotel using a booking website, mainly because of what it looked like on their own direct website ‚Äì lofty rooms, clean, modern interior and great views. It wasn‚Äôt the cheapest we saw, but we thought it looked like a great place for our 3 night stay in Dublin.

We arrived early in the morning, and were impressed by the reception area (however looking back this is not the reception on the website!) located on the second floor. It all looked new and very nicely decorated. The guy that checked us in said we could have our room straight away, which was great seeing as it was 7.30am! We had booked an executive double, paying extra for this privilege based on the photos on the hotels own website, which looked great.

You can imagine our surprise when we walked into our room (4th floor at the back of the hotel, right at the end of the corridor ‚Äì 471 if I remember correctly) and seemed to step back in time, to a dingy, tatty, 1990‚Äôs horror!

The room had a double and a single bed with a small table and chairs, a beautiful view of the back ally and a train track running right past the window! The bathroom was disgusting and as a previous reviewer wrote had a horrible plastic bath mat, which was gross. We immediately phoned down to reception and explained we had booked an executive room, and were informed this was the executive room! We started to question whether we had actually booked the wrong hotel and the website we had looked at was for somewhere else, but I have come back and checked again, and it was the right one!

Anyway, after the most uncomfortable nights sleep ever, in a terribly lumpy bed which it was impossible to sleep on, plus paper thin walls and trains going past the window constantly, we complained and were told the porter would move our luggage to a new room. I wasn‚Äôt hopeful, and actually considered checking out, but decided to wait and see what they offered us. We got back and got our new room key and couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes when we walked in to this beautiful new room, just 4 rooms down the same corridor! It was lovely ‚Äì just like we had seen on the internet. There were still minor problems (lots of train noise and our electricity kept going off ‚Äì problem with the key pad thing on the wall) but aside from that, it made our stay in Dublin much more pleasant. It was like we were in a different hotel!

As mentioned in other reviews, the communal areas are a bit strange ‚Äì the residents lounge is like a waiting room (we went in their once to have an afternoon drink and had to turn the light on ourselves!) and the bar / pub next door is quite seedy so not worth going in. For the life of us we couldn‚Äôt find the nice bar areas that are shown on the website ‚Äì perhaps you have to be a ‚Äòpremier suite‚Äô guest to hunt those down.

With regards to the staff, we only met one. The same guy that checked us in on the first day was the only one we saw and dealt with the entire time and although he wasn‚Äôt rude at any point, he was not particularly warm and welcoming either and did not seem to care about our initial concerns when we first checked in.

The moral to this story is when you book, ASK for a nice room as this hotel is like some sort of twilight zone, and it seems to be pot luck what type of experience you have. If I had been checked into a nice room straight away, I would never have known about the other side of it, so I can understand why it gets such great reviews from some people. I have seen both sides and would probably not risk going back.",3,2010,01,30
219,Couldnt wait to leave,"We stayed for one night(thank God) It is easily one of the worst hotels I have ever encountered.We paid ‚Ç¨79 room only rate.We booked an ""executive double"" which looked fabulous on the website- when we arrived the room was a dark noisy grimy looking B&b type effort, the bathroom was disgusting a dirty old ribber mat thrown on the bath.My skin crawled it just had that real grimy dirty feel. We went to a concert returned about midnight and were shown to the ""residents lounge"" which is just a big room on the 2nd floor with people sitting around the night porter takes orders for drink, we ordered a round-took 25 mins to come then he disappeared. Other residents got chatting about how unbelievably mis leading the website is.We ran out of it the following morning NEVER again.",1,2010,01,23
219,Horrible,"I travel quite a bit but have to say this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.  We were given a ""standard"" room which was 1st floor/front of hotel.  The traffic noise from  the busy street was awful and I immediately complained, but despite it being afternoon, I was told no other rooms were available. Why they don't put inside ""storm"" windows to block noise from the street (like our London Hotel had), I don't know--apparently they just don't care. I checked around for another hotel, but everything was booked.  We left for dinner, came back about 10 PM to find out our room was directly over the bar which had live music.  The floor of our room was actually vibrating from the loud noise and I couldn't hear my husband talk.  I went to the desk and said this was unacceptable.  They tried to blame my room on my booking service--oops --I had booked directly with them.  They said the hotel web site states live music till midnight in the bar--but that doesn't tell me to expect it IN MY ROOM.  After much rudeness, they finally ""found"" an empty room on the back of the hotel--slightly bigger & nicer and QUIET although it did have a broken window that didn't close completely, so some alley noise was heard but NOTHING like having a band practically playing in your room.  The porter who helped us move rooms was nice and said the rooms on the front of the hotel are noted to be extremely noisy, despite the front desk arguing with me that they weren't that bad.  It truly was intolerable and  I am so glad we could check out the next day.  I would not recommend staying here--you just don't know which room you will get and they certainly don't listen to complaints.",1,2010,01,01
219,"great value, excellant service!!","i just thought id write a review of my experience after reading all the negative ones. i travelled with my partner and group of friends, and found the hotel to be an absolute pleasure!! the room was spacious and spotless, service was great, and the tv had plenty of channels at a reasonable price!! its in an excellant location for people heading out in the city i would absolutely reccommend staying here to everyone!!!!!",4,2009,12,29
219,Dont understand the bad reviews???,"Well, what can I say? Just returned home from a nights stay at this hotel and cannot fault it, and cannot understand the bad reviews it has gotten on here. I think some people expect far more than they are prepared to pay for, or just look for things to pick at. 
Myself and my partner were going to a concert in the O2, which were a Christmas present, so we booked last minute. I booked one of the executive rooms, as they were very reasonably priced, and we booked breakfast too. I then came on Tripadvisor, after booking, and read the bad reviews, so was VERY apprehensive, especially as my OH knew of the hotel bar which was used as a meeting point for GAA fans going to Croke!! 
We arrived, and went into the car park where the attendant came straight out, and took the car to park it for us. It is a ‚Ç¨7 overnight charge, but worth it. Went in to reception, and initial thoughts were that it looked nice. Lady on reception was very nice, and friendly. We went up to our room, which was on the 7th floor, and wow, gorgeous room. Clean, well set out. As I said, could not fault it. I have to say, my partner and I spent the evening saying ""seems great, but we will reserve judgement"", and this is because again, of the bad reviews on here. We went into the bar, which, yes, is dated, but didnt feel intimidating. Obviously a real locals pub. 
There was a shuttle bus to the venue every 20 minutes, but we didnt use it, but good service. 
When we arrived back from concert, went to the bar again and had a few drinks. Very friendly staff. 
We then went to the residents bar, and had a hotdog each, (at midnight), and I liked this service. 
The bed - I slept so soundly, a really comfy big bed. No outside noises, heating controlled yourself, a great tv. Just great. 
Breakfast was a buffet, and was yum. Even service was spot on, with your tea and coffee and toast brought to your table. Plenty of food, and hot. 
So, my partner and I both agreed that it got a 10 out of 10. Seriously, I cannot think of any faults, except I would have liked to stay longer, and there were no mushrooms at breakfast!!",5,2009,12,29
219,Don't stay in the 'standard double'.,"I went with a group of friends for Stephen's night. I was staying in a room with my boyfriend and payed the same as my friends who had booked the same day.They had been upgraded to gorgeous large quiet rooms on the 5th floor, whereas my boyfriend and I had a tiny, cold room on the first floor. The heating wasnt working at the beginning, but it was rectified shortly. The ironing board we were given was broken and the hairdryer in the room nearly blew up in my hand. When it was time to go asleep it was so noisey outside, we could hear every conversation outside, every train, every car, every door being opened and closed that we just left our friends and checked out at half nine, got home at 11 and slept there. If you want to pay more for the rooms on higher floors, do, but the standard are terrible. If your a heavy sleeper you probably wont get a rest atall. This hotel has its good and bad points but unfortunaly for my boyfriend and I, we got a taste of the bad points. My review is based on our room on the first floor.",2,2009,12,29
219,Disturbingly Bad,"This was one of the worst Hotels i have ever stayed in , the rooms are outdated, 
Restaurant is closed,
The day we went for breakfast we had to wait as the Breakfast staff had slept it out,
Its such a rough area with pick pockets in the area,i really didnt feel safe,
Car Park is a nightmare it took half hour to get our car as it was parked way up the back.
Never Never Again, Forget it.",2,2009,12,24
219,There's a train line outside the window...,"I'll keep this short and simple. We were having a competition in the office as to the worst hotel we'd ever stayed in on business and even though it was 4 years ago I remembered the North Star Hotel.

I will just say this - there is a train line right outside the window and the trains start around 6 am. When I say right outside, I mean right outside, not 100m away, not 50m away, right outside. I have no complaints at all about the staff, the accomodation, the food, nothing. Simply the fact that there are some rooms which have a train track virtually IN them. We did, of course, ask to be given different rooms but were told this was not an option. 

Whatever you do, if you are going to stay here, ASK THEM how close your room is to the 6am train-passing-room-shaking-wake-up-call you are going to be. You have been warned.",1,2009,12,03
219,Great Hotel for the money.  Good Location.,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of November and the hotel was perfect for what we needed. The rooms were in good condition and have everything you needed. The staff were friendly and the hotel had a good bar which I also found friendly. The location of the hotel is good. We got the airbus 748 from the airport and got off at the first stop which was right outside the hotel. 

Henry Street with all the high street shops on was 5 mins walk.
Temple Bar was a 15 min walk
Grafton Street was a 15 min walk.

I did not here any trains from our room and we just had a standard room I did here a few trains at reception.

Taxi was 11 euros from temple bar.

Any question please email me.",4,2009,12,01
219,TERRIBLE STAY. POOR HOTEL. RUDE PEOPLE.,"A terrible stay. The rooms were poor and dirty, the noise from the train passing by the window and the pub under the room was a problem. The woman at the reception during the check out in the morning was rude. Moreover we had to pay even to leave the luggage stored for few hours...",1,2009,11,29
219,The Color of Money,"This place is a real kip. I have been in many motel in my life and some weren't great but this kills them all!!!!!!!!!!

Got a bedroom on the old side of the building.....at check in the train passed and the whole building was shaking. The receptionist started laughing and said it effect mostly the old part and then handed me the key and pointed to the old part!! 
I was shocked!!!

I asked to speak with a manager and I was told he was busy he could have seen me later.
I asked to have a room on the other side of the building and the receptionist still smiling said"" You need to pay extra for that!!!""
At this point I noticed a man, behind the counter not to far from the reception girl, counting money, they were loads of 100's and he was counting and somehow licking the notes. That was a bit disgusting.

We went to the bedroom, a box you wouldn't sleep in  for all the money that man was counting!!!!!!!!!!!

We decided to leave as I didn't want to pay extra to get that man to lick more notes!!!!

The Color of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Stay away from this place!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,2009,11,25
219,"Great hotel, great stuff","I was in the North star with my friend in October and I have to say the hotel is not a Gresham but i didn't pay the same rate eighter.We loved it and i found everything fine and very familier. Our room was a twin room and it was clean and comfortable. The breakfast is just perfect and stuff is very nice. Kieron was absolutly helpful, Paddy in the bar just great and funny and Rita the receptionist is just so lovely, you don't want to lieve the hotel after her smile. We will come back again defienetly.",4,2009,11,18
219,Who is in Charge ???,"I stayed here with my wife and was dissapointed by the way we were treated by the Management, 
My room that i was given in the hotel was a disgrace small damp musty smelly and the pillow slips were dirty and mildew in bathroom,
stains on the carpet,
i complained about the size of my room, and dirt and asked for a change but was told the manager was to busy and was in the laundry helping out apparently the housekeeper is a manager as well no wonder the rooms are dirty.
The bar area was dirty and a very bad odour from counter,
Restaurant is only open weekend, 
The service in the  Breakfast restaurant was poor and the toast was cold all the fruit served is out of a tin and there is no meats or cheese provided and when i asked the waitress for some she said it wasn't possible.",1,2009,11,14
219,Best for O2 concerts,"I stayed at this hotel because I was going to see Simply Red at the O2. Really was a good spot since the pick up area for the bus is just steps outside the hotel. The bus however doesn't drop you off at the venue, you will have to walk a little. None the less, hotel was as expected. I stayed in a premier suite. Room was clean and always taken care of by the time I got back from being out.  No noise from the bar or train was ever heard and I kept my sliding patio door open at night. I walked everywhere in town & never a hassle getting back.  Kieran the concierge helped me out greatly. I only wish they had free internet and breakfast.  I will stay again when I go back to Dublin.",4,2009,11,08
219,"Whose Telling Porkys,,,","Im not sure about these reviews here seem there either very good or very bad , and it seems that only the good reviews are answered but not the bad ones which i find strange.
But i will let you make your own mind up , 
i did stay here with my wife and here are the following complaints :

1. No lift to reception from main entrance,
2. No Porter on duty to bring up our luggage.
3. No Concierge on duty when we needed it
4. No Manager on duty as they were serving breakfast.
5. No internet access in room as they were having trouble.
6. No Resaturant open on the Tuesday night we were there.
7. No Decent rooms on the old part of hotel 
8. Yes you can get a better room if you pay the hotel more money : exploitation
9. Yes the bar area is rowdy with local thugs i was terrified in there one night
10. Yes i also got a drink in bar in a hot chipped glass
11. Yes the hotel Reception is dark and gloomy and Rita was rathe rude.
12,  Yes the bedroom was small musty with trains passing by (unless you upgrade ie give them more of your hard earned money)'
13. Yes the Gym is unsupervised which is illegal 
14, Yes i would never stay here again 
I  Await a reply by the management",1,2009,11,06
219,No problems,"I have to agree with the last poster Paul.  I recently stayed in the hotel for 1 night with my boyfriend after attending a concert in the O2.  Have to admit that I was a bit pesimpistic after reading the reviews but the hotel was great and we had no complaints.  We stayed in a double executive room and while it was basic it was absolutely spotless clean which it my opinion is more important than how the decor looks.  The bed was comfortable and we had a sound sleep, breakfast was buffet style and was lovely.  Staff servicing breakfast were great and receptionist (who people complained about in previous reviews) couldn't have been nicer.  Would recommend hotel for a stay and if we go to another concert in the O2 again I would definitely book in to the North Star again for the night.",3,2009,11,06
219,Regular guest,"I stay here regularly with my company and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

The food is excellent, the staff are wonderful and I have never had a problem in the bar.
The location is perfect for anybody doing business in the IFSC.

Some of the reviews here are ridiculous.

219,Nice Stay,"I recently stayed here for a concert on the o2. Really enjoyed my stay
staff are friendly and helpful,great location and the shuttle to the o2 is a big plus.
Kieran the concierge couldn't do enough for us, he was brilliant.

Value for money and a an experience, will definitely consider coming back.",5,2009,10,29
219,not up to standards,"I decided to book into the hotel as my brother and his partner where staying there and it was easy for me to travel home,also my mam recommended it to me. I was given a rate of ‚Ç¨85.00 i was travelling to the O2 to see pink on thursday the 15th Oct. the price is redicilous for a single room it includes  no breakfast, i had to go to a cafe for my breakfast. when we arrived back at the hotel my brother got me a corridel drink in the bar and it was given to him in a HOT pint glass which you do not serve a cold drink in a hot glass to anyone. the bed was extreamly uncomfortable, the key would not open my door on two occasions. I later saw a voucher saying O2 specials ‚Ç¨55.00pps why was i not offered that rate?? It was a compleate rip off..",2,2009,10,24
219,"Good location, but rooms are basic","We stayed in north star for 3 nights. Upon arriving we were sent to a room in the depths of the hotel to room 122 situated right beneath a railway bridge.  The room was tiny, the walls were cracked, and generally the room looked like it had not been decorated in years. The bathroom was really small and had mould problems too.  The worst was to come when a train passed over the bridge and the whole room rumbled and shook. We immediately reported it to reception and requested to move but were told the hotel was fully booked and that we would be able to move rooms the following day.  Needless to say we had limited sleep, not only with the train noise and the room shaking, but the noise coming from the bar above was also very loud.

We were moved the following day to a bigger room, which, thankfully was in much better condition. We still had the train passing our window and the double glazed windows weren‚Äôt thick enough to block out the noise so it was still not ideal. The bed wasn't the most comfortable I've stayed in either.

The location is very good to use the Luas, buses and an easy walk into the centre too. However, they really need to re-consider giving anyone the rooms near 122 as they are not up to standard and we feel we were ripped off a bit on the first night was stayed.",3,2009,10,21
219,Loved every minute of our stay,"Must admit I was a little apprehensive about staying at the hotel becasue of some of the reviews but after staying I can't see where the negative comments are coming from to be honest. 

I booked a trip to Dublin as a present for girlfriends birthday. Before our visit I emailed the hotel with a couple of questions and within half a day they had replied answering all my queries. 

We arrived on the Saturday evening of Ireland v Italy at Croke Park so the streets around the hotel were bustling. Upon entering the hotel the reception was clearly signposted up the stairs and we were greeted with a smile and hello even though there was a small queue forming which is only expected with it being a busy time. I had booked a Premier King Room and I was informed by reception I had been upgraded to a Premier Suite which was a lovely suprise and gesture. All facilities, breakfast options and checking out procedures were explained before we set off to our room. We were given the W B Yeates suite on floor 5 and upon entering we couldn't believe the size of the room. The room was also spotless and we couldn't ask for anything more. After a quick shower and change we set off to watch the football in the local bars on route to Temple Bar. On our way out the reception staff asked if everything was ok with the room and gave us directions to the what we were after. 

We had a top night out even though some of the drink prices in the centre are eye watering. We got back to the hotel in the early hours of the morning after walking back from the centre and felt under no threat at all. Our room was at the back of the hotel and we had a peacful nights sleep with no noise of trains going past or people running up and down the corridors fighting as previously stated in past reviews! 

We had breakfast at the hotel and couldn't complain about anything, we were greeted at the entrance of the restaraunt and taken to a table. The breakfast set us up nicely for a day of sightseeing and shopping which the hotel is ideally placed for. When we got back to our room it had been cleaned with fresh towels supplied. We went out again Sunday evening this time for a meal (Toscana, highly recommended by the way). We again walked back to hotel after our night out and called into a few of the local pubs which all had live entertainment on. 

We woke up on the Monday morning and had to relunctantly get ready to check out. Think my girlfriend would of stayed forever if possible! No problems checking out and the reception wished us a safe journey home. 

I'm not normally one for reviews but I feel some of the past negative reviews have been really unfair to the hotel so thought I would add my own! We loved every minute of our stay and both agreed that we would stay at the hotel again if we returned to Dublin.",5,2009,10,12
219,A nice friendly city centre hotel,"Was a bit worried after reading the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were basic but very clean. Air con worked whch was good because the street behind us was wild and noisy. Fortunately the double glazing was great. Coming from glasgow Talbot street held no fears and we were never bothered even at night. Less beggars there than O'Connell street! The bar and beer 'Arch' were fun. Where the hotel reallywins is its staff. They were extremely friendly , helpful and efficient.  Only downer was the room was a smoking one.  Would use this hotel for a cheap visit to Dublin. I never expected the Gresham but I never paid Greshm prices either!",4,2009,10,01
219,A great stay in Dublin,"We have recently returned after a wonderful short stay in Dublin. The North Star Hotel was an excellent base for us, very comfortable and welcoming and only a short walk to the major attractions and bars. Our room 658 was a lovely spacious pleasantly decorated air conditioned room with a very comfortable king-sized bed, ensuite with a lovely bathroom with power shower.
The full Irish breakfast was equally good with something there for everybody and as much as you wanted. The fried bread especially melted in the mouth while it was great to have both white and black pudding on the menu.
The staff were very pleasant and helpful at all times with nothing too much trouble. For only 3 euros they kept all our luggage securely from the morning of our departure until our flight later that evening. All in all we couldn't have asked for more and were very satisfied and found it great value for money.

P.S. we never experienced any noise in our room and on reading reviews from other people wondered if we were staying at the same hotel! We would heartily recommend this hotel to anybody.",5,2009,09,26
219,horrible,"This has been a real nightmare!!!! I do not think I have ever dealt with such ignorant people in my entire life.

I checked in and as per reservation requested a room that can accommodate a disable person. My brother is on a wheelchair.

The hotel was full ad the reception manager forgot to allocate the room. I immediately asked to speak with the manager as I was terribly upset and I was told that he wasn't available. I did hear the receptionist talking to this person on the phone.............

We finally got accommodated in a room you wouldn't let a dog in. I think Guantanamo is a holiday resort compared to this.

My brother was too upset and we decided to leave.

The manager never showed up, reception didn't care. Congratulation!!!! 

WHAT A SHAME!!!!!!!",1,2009,09,25
219,Brilliant absolutely brilliant,"When I checked on tripadvisor as to the previous reviews on this hotel, I decided to run the chance and I am glad I did.

The location, whilst it can be a bit on the dodgy side at night, it perfect.  Directly across from Connolly station, it is 2 LUAS stops from O'Connell Street, and Grafton is a short walk past that, 3 from Jervis Shopping Centre, and along the red line you will find Museums, Jameson and Heuston Station.  There is also a taxi bank just across the street.  It is perfect!!

I decided to stay in a premier club room and it was well worth it.  I had a lovey balcony and was on the back of the hotel.  I could look out and see the Spire. 

Whilst there is some noise, it is to be expected in the core of an urban centre.  To expect otherwise would be unrealistic.

The bathroom and room were modern and clean.  The bed was comfortable and for the 16 nights I stayed here, it truly felt like a home away from home.

The staff were friendly, accomodating and helpful.  I wanted to find my way to the Irish-Jewish museum, and Ciaran the concierge not only got me the proper address, he printed off the information, along with bus routes and the approximate cost of a taxi and slipped it under my door.  Talk about SERVICE!! 

I did not make use of the restaurant and I choose not to include breakfast in my room booking.   

The gym, while the machines are a bit dated, they more then served the purpose.   I loved the fact that to access the gym you need a key card.  That key card takes you to the hotel elevators which then take you down to the ground level, then the key card is needed to access the gym facilities.  Talk about secure!!  

Meeting up with old friends from University, they knew not only where the hotel was but had themselves stayed there before and concurred with me that this was definately the best place to be.

It was also close to Croke Park and during my visit I was around for the All Ireland Finals for both hurling and gaelic football.  It was brilliant!!!

All in all this is not a 5 star hotel, but if that is what you are looking for then you are going to be paying prices well above and beyond the very reasonable rates at the North Star.

I will be coming back in the new year and this will be my hotel of choice.  

I highly recommend the North Star and spending the extra money for the Premier Club!!  

SIMPLY BRILLIANT STAY!",5,2009,09,20
219,Exactly what it says on the tin.,"Spent weekend there for get together with family from south east and UK.  Rooms were comfortable although very warm with non functioning, noisy air conditioning.  Concierge was charming man and keen to be of assistance as were all the staff we encountered during our stay. Gold medal of excellence has to go to the  waitress working alone in the restaurant on Friday evening. We were a party of 13 and found food was slow to reach the table as our poor waitress was looking after the needs of all diners by herself.  She kept her composure throughout staying cheerful and curteous while under pressure.  Same girl was in attendance for breakfast the following morning although this time not alone and was every bit as helpful and friendly as the pevious evening.  Breakfast was tasty and plentiful. Went out for dinner on Saturday evening only because service was so slow on Friday.  On the down side was McCoys bar which attracted a few 'dodgy' looking characters. Luas is only across the road so we all hopped aboard and went to city centre. I would recommend the hotel only as a place to lay your head and base to explore city centre which is only short walk away.",3,2009,09,13
219,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend for 5 nights. I was apprehensive about booking it as there are so many bad reviews on here, but I thought it was too good a deal to pass up as they also had a discount going. There are also many good reviews along with the bad ones, which I found very confusing and contradictory, but I thought the people who reviewed it positively must have had some reason. I assumed they had booked different types of rooms, but I don't know if this is the case. It exceeded my expectations and I consider myself very picky, we booked a Premier Club Room which was only a little extra than the basic rooms. As far as I can tell it is well worth paying this - our room was fantastic, clean, great shower, lots of good tv channels and a massive comfortable bed. Some of these rooms have a balcony but we just had a sort of ledge whilst the room next door had a proper balcony. Didn't really bother me though as you're not going to spend much time out there anyway, it only overlooks a sidestreet.
Room was cleaned every day and we were given more coffee, sugar, milk, bottles of water etc. We were not charged 6 euro for them like other people were, though indeed the water from the bathroom tap is disgusting and we did need to buy water for our stay. The fridge came in handy as well though rather small - the hotel is near lots of shops and supermarkets so finding food was not a problem. It was a little bit further into the main attractions and sites but I would still consider this a central hotel and perfectly walkable. Did not have much contact with the staff as we had no problems, but every time we did they were courteous and professional. Did not visit the bar next to the hotel but seemed very popular. Given that the hotel is right on a busy street and opposite the station, I was expecting the worst when it came to noise levels, but as we were at the top and facing a side street, we were not disturbed by any noise at all. The trains are noisy from the reception area and the residents' lounge, so I can see why it might be noisy on the first floors at the front, but we did not have a problem at all on our floor (the sixth). We were given a leaflet of the facilities on arrival which was quite useful though we didn't end up using any; there was a magazine about dining in Dublin that was also very useful as it gave sample menus and prices. The Premier Club Lounge was empty when we visited it but seemed to be a nice place to sit with coffee. I don't know if we were very lucky or the people who wrote bad reviews were very unlucky, but we had a fantastic stay here and had no complaints. Our room was lovely and spacious, decor is fantastic throughout hotel, trendy but comfortable, and in our opinion had everything we could have wanted. I would definitely recommend this hotel, but I would suggest getting the Premier Club Room - it wasn't that much extra and we definitely got what we paid for it seems, looking at other reviews.",4,2009,09,07
219,Basic and very noisy but great location,"we stayed in the North Star Hotel for 2 nights this month. the location was great, just a few minutes walk from o'connel street and temple bar. the room served its purpose for us - comfortable beds and good location for seeing Dublin. however - our room was below the noisy tram track and everytime a tram goes over the hotel it is like an earthquake was happening. the bathroom was mouldy, and the carpet needed a good hoover, and was turning up in the corners. the staff were also quite unhelpful. the breakfast is not worth 9.99euros either, you can get a much nicer and cheaper breakfast from local cafes. the breakfast room was hot stuffy and dingy. 
i would recommend that if you book this hotel you ask for a room away from the tram track!",3,2009,09,05
219,"Clean, modern, well situated","I'm at loss to understand some of the negative reviews the North Star has been getting, so much so that I've specifically signed up to Trip Advisor to defend it.

I've stayed twice here in the last few weeks, once with my wife for the U2 concerts in July and again with my entire family (14, 12 and 8) for a midweek break just last week as a treat for the kids before they went back to school.

The fact that I returned with my children tells you all you need to know about the North Star. If I was in any way put off by the place the first time round there's no way I'd have come back again.

The hotel is situated right across the road from Connolly Station and just a few minutes walk from the city centre, ideal for those on foot or with young children. The rooms are spacious, clean (we got fresh towels each morning of our stay), warm and generally cosy. 

No-one in our party complained about the beds being too hard or the pillows uncomfortable either - which is another bonus.

I found the staff friendly, both at reception and when they passed you in the corridor - always a quick hello or a smile. The food (certainly at breakfast, didn't sample dinner) was excellent and set us all up for the day ahead.

Re: pricing. I was pleasantly surprised at the deal we got. Granted it was a midweek stay but for a party of five it worked out at just 24 euros per person per night. Beat that!

The only negative thing I could say (just to prove I don't actually work for the North Star!) is the hit and miss internet connection in our room. I had to go out into the corridor to get a connection which was inconvenient but not a major disaster. I would say that little fault was down to the position of the room more than anything else.

We plan to return to Dublin again for another short break and we will definitely be booking back into the North Star.",5,2009,09,05
219,fantastic value hotel,"Decided to book this hotel after reading good reviews on this site and great price on hotel-direct.  After booking though, reviews did go a bit downhill so was very apprehensive as was booking for myself and three friends!  
When we arrived at the hotel, you have to walk a few steps to get to reception - no big deal, and if you need help, there's a porter to help you!  The receptionist, Rita, was very helpful and friendly, so can only assume that it must have been her day off when other posters have complained about reception staff! Our room was on first floor, so I was worried about the noise from the train station, though obviously I was expecting it as it's right opposite Connolly Station!  However, the very noisy air-con drowned the noise of the trains,  and we really needed the air-con on, as it was so warm in hotel! Our room was nice enough and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was usual buffet style, with cereals and full Irish etc.  No complaints. 
The only thing that I would agree with other posters is that the bar in the hotel seems to attract rather dubious looking characters standing outside, so for this reason, we didn't actually venture inside!  But obviously, as it's open to the public, I suppose there isn't much the hotel can do about that. 
The location was great, only a few minutes from O'Connell Street and 15 minutes from Grafton Street and Temple Bar area of the city.  Other posters have commented about it being a bit run-down, but we felt safe walking back to the hotel late at night  (four females).
I would recommend this hotel, as apart from the couple of issues that I mentioned, it didn't affect our stay, and would return again.  We paid less than ¬£58 for a twin room with full breakfast, save your euros for food and drink which is very expensive in my opinion!",4,2009,08,26
219,FANTASTIC,"Excellent stay at this Hotel, def recommend and would return again. We had booked standard double rooms, but were given 3 executive family rooms on arrival for no extra charge. Breakfast was very nice indeed",5,2009,08,24
219,"Nice location, nasty receptionist.","Stayed in the North Star on Saturday 22 August 2009. The location and prices are reasonably good so it's such a shame the Spanish receptionist was so bad mannered. Upon our check in she was surly and incapable of explaining that payments for accomodation had to be pre-authorised by credit card, even though we were willing to pay cash in advance. Her English was poor and her attitude worse. She smugly repeated the same incomprehensible phrase and shrugged her shoulders when we politely asked could we pay with laser card.
Her attitude when we checked out the next morning was even worse. No please, no thank you, just a pouting expression. With a trollop like this on reception I can only advise people to avoid this hotel like swine flu.",2,2009,08,24
219,Very Good but need to sort their Club Lounge out!,"Having emailed the hotel twice to establish what the Premier Club Room I had booked offered compared to the other rooms at the hotel and not getting a response, I must admit I was starting to worry!

Anyway, when we entered the hotel itself, we were pleasantly surprised.  The entrance way and reception are very nicely decorated and certainly looks very impressive from the start.

We tried to check in and we were told that unfortunately the room would not be available until 2pm (which is the normal check in time) but, we could leave our bags if we wished to do so.  I decided to leave mine and I am not sure if you are charged for leaving a bag after check out but I was not charged for leaving it before check in!

After spending the afternoon enjoying Dublin we headed back to the hotel.  The receptionist was very friendly and directed us to our room informing me that the porter would bring the bag I had left shortly (which he did).  On entering the premier club bedroom, we were very, very impressed.  The room was nicely decorated and the bed, WOW ‚Äì so comfortable. One of the best beds we personally have slept in.

The room overlooked the front of the hotel which does have the train track running through the middle of it and I must admit this did cause us concerns. However, we did not hear the trains at all so the windows must be well sound proofed.

We decided to have a look at the 7th Floor Club Lounge as part of booking the room was gaining Club Lounge access.  We were disappointed to find the door wide open (therefore open to anyone who had not paid the extra amount for a Club Room!).  Anyway, although the Club Lounge is again nicely decorated, we were very let down by the facilities.  A coffee machine, tea bags and a few bottles of water (which aren‚Äôt cold as the fridge is turned off!).  There weren‚Äôt any cups, very few glasses and no snacks!

On leaving the room, I closed the door to lock it and then tried my room key ‚Äì the door would not re-open.  On returning to the bedroom, I called reception and again they promptly sent the Porter with a new key card that worked.

On the way out that evening, we asked the Receptionist about what facilities were in the club lounge.  She mentioned newspapers, coffee, tea, water and snacks.  I mentioned there weren‚Äôt any snacks and she said there should be biscuits (which we noticed were restocked later!).  We asked about the continental breakfast which was advertised in the room and also shows on the photos on the hotels website (the receptionist was quite shocked this was advertised in the rooms).  The reception told us that they were unable to offer this but because we had booked several months ago, we could have complimentary continental breakfast in the breakfast room and gave us a voucher for this (very good service again).

Breakfast the next day was OK but nothing really to write home about.  From a continental breakfast point of view, it was a choice of 3 or 4 cereals, toast, some fruit, yogurt and fruit juice (no pastries, meats, cheeses, etc).  The pictures of the non-existent Club Lounge continental breakfast looks so much better.

At check out, the same receptionist asked about our stay (unusual at most hotels these days!!).  We said that the room was excellent but the Club Lounge was very disappointing and there wasn‚Äôt really any point in having one if there are no facilities and no cups, glasses, etc).  We know this is Dublin and you spend very little time in the hotel, but Club Lounges are normally a nice place to go before going out for a quick drink, etc).

Overall, we would stay again but they should either close the Club Lounge and just call the rooms Luxury Bedrooms or get the lounge sorted out!  The staff were all very helpful and pleasant and we did not encounter any negatively from staff as others have reported.

I have sent a copy of this review to the hotel as I know they like to comment!!!",4,2009,08,17
219,"Great room, good location","We stayed here for 3 nights during the U2 concert at Croke Park.  Coming from Canada we weren't too sure how convienent this location would be, but it was only a 15 min walk to Croke Park, 10 min walk to O'Connell street and 15 min walk to Temple Bar.  The room was spacious, the bathroom and shower were great.  The room had a fridge, iron, ironing board and hair dryer which was very useful. The view isn't that great, and if you leave the balcony door open you can really hear the trains. I thought the staff were friendly and helpful.  Didn't use the internet as we felt it was expensive.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2009,08,06
219,Customer Service - Not a chance,Terrible terrible customer service. It is worth pointing out any issues with the hotel seem only to be dealt with on trip advisor and not between manager and the customer. This is not a route I have taken lightly though I am so disappointed with the lack of customer care that I felt it is something I should highlight following the two of the worst nights sleep of my life given the uncomfortable tempature of the room. We contacted reception about twice- neither time did the manager get in touch as promised.  I went back to complain to the relief manager about this after check out and was advised that the manager would be in touch to discuss - two months later and numerous emails to the hotel via their website I have heard nothing. I am more annoyed that no-one has ever taken the time to speak to me about this issue that the two afwul nights sleep and the subsequent cold I had. There are better places to stay (location isn't great at night) in Dublin certainly ones that would respect and value customers. I would never recommend this hotel. Also the attached bar is a vile place with the locals believe they take rights over the hotel guests in the hotel lobby and acting down right rude. The smoking area is in the car park the noise echos through the court yard are nicely magnified till 2 am.,1,2009,08,05
219,Great for concerts at Croke Park,"Stayed here because of a U2 concert at Croke Park. Very convenient for the stadium, 15 minute walk. Great pub attached to it with a damn fine pint of Guinness, stops serving food at 9.30. Internet expensive and very bad connection. Parking at hotel 5 euros a night, but its 24 hours and safe. Nice rooms, nothing special. I think the price went up because of the concert though, so check prices.",4,2009,07,31
219,Well located hotel in City Centre,"Dont be put off by Exterior of this Hotel, As it is totally different on interior Stayed in a business class room at a great rate and had a Balcony and use of a club suite where you could have fresh coffee.The rooms are super in business class and spotless.The Luas station is across the road ""Connolly Station"" and is great for getting around.Car park located at rear of Hotel for ‚Ç¨7.00 per night and any Staff we met were friendly and helpful.A taxi from Templebar was ‚Ç¨6.00 at night.Staff told me the best rate is got on internet we booked on lastminute.com as a secret hotel and while we were concerned after booking we were delighted at the choice.Also would be perfect for a concert in Croke Park or the O2.",5,2009,07,30
219,U2 Weekend,"Handy for Croke Park noisy at night until about 12.30 am try not to stop in rooms over bar!
OK basic hotel not far from station and O'Connel St",3,2009,07,26
219,Excellent hotel - would recommend to anyone,"Excellent hotel, staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms in Premier class superb. Ideally situated for all amenities. Restaurant meal was fabulous- generous portions. Only downside (if there was one) our room was at rear of hotel and some residents in an opposite building were rather rowdy until 3.30am!!! But that was not the fault of the North Star and would definetly go back again.",5,2009,07,24
219,"free upgrade, yey!!!","Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and upon arrival were told we had been upgrade to a premier club room. The room was very spacious and the beds extremley cormfy. We also got to use the premier club suite which had a coffee machine, water and biscuits!
Brekfast was what you would expect, i tried black and white pudding for the first time and was pleasently suprised!
The hotel is right next to connolly station and o'Conell street is a few minutes walk away.
As for noise from the trains you can hear and feel it inn reception but not a thing in our rooms.
We got a three day hop on hop off bus ticket that was a great way to see the city and inckuded the bus to the airport",4,2009,07,21
219,enjoyable stay,"This hotel is not what I expected from reading reviews here.
I have not experienced any of the discomfort outlined by previous posters
and feel that it could damage the reputation of the business.

I stayed here in June for business with five of my colleagues as we were attending a business meeting in the ifsc.

The rooms are just refurbished and very modern, more than you would expect from a three star hotel. 
For the duration of my three night stay, I did not have one problem and
the staff  also polite and very friendly.
The location is superb, minutes walk to the ifsc and O'Connoll Street.

I will also asking my colleagues to post there views also, to counter the unfair comments made from some posters.",5,2009,07,19
219,shabby hotel,"I stayed at the hotel recently & after reading some of the negative reviews, i was a bit apprehensive about staying here before my arrival.
Location wise i thought the hotel was well situated, near to train & bus stations & within easy walking distance to all the other attractions.
On my arrival, i thought the reception staff were very helpful & polite & my initial concerns were disappearing.
However, walking to my room on the 2nd floor, the shabby decor & musky smell, i began to fear the worst.
My room wasn't much better. The room size was good, however, the furnishings were shabby, the smell again musky & the beds shocking. 
The bathroom, again decent size, however, the shower didn't work properly & what water came out was freezing cold.
Although the price was cheap compared to other hotels in the city, i'd seriously advise people to spend an extra 10 to 15 pounds for a decent hotel than staying here, especially for couples/families.",1,2009,07,15
219,lovely stay,"A very nice hotel, central located, a mix of old and new, I would say quite fashionable. The staff was prompt and helpful and the concierge was fantastic. The meal we had in the bar was well served and tested good. Our room was an executive room located on the 4th floor with a view towards the car park. The room was clean and presentable. Overall, a good stay.",5,2009,07,14
219,Not as bad as we were warned,"After reading many of the bad reviews about this hotel, me and my friend had concerns about booking, but because we were travelling on a budget we decided to take a risk and book this hotel as it was the cheapest.

All in all we thought the hotel met all of our needs. The trains can be heard very clearly and loudly in the reception area, but we could not hear anything from our room (it was on the first floor facing on to a side street). The staff at the front desk were very helpful and answered all of our questions, and even let me use the reception internet to print off my boarding pass for my return flight.

When we first arrived we thought the breakfast was a tad expensive so only had it one day, but unfortunately it appears that expensive is the going rate in Dublin! The only downside we found was the 3 euro charge for them to look after your baggage after check out. This is the first hotel I have ever experienced such a charge at, but we paid it nonetheless as it was preferable to carting our suitcases around Dublin all day. And if we are being picky, the air con did not cool our room down at all.

The location is about a 5-10 minute walk to O'Connell Street, and then a further 10 mins or so to the bigger attractions of Dublin south of the river, so if you want to be in the thick of things, then this is not the hotel for you.

And just to reply to a few earlier comments - a few people have mentioned the stairs that lead up to reception. It is not the steep narrow staircase described, but about 5 steps. And there is a concierge on the ground floor, which i'm sure if anyone had any difficulties would help lift the suitcases. The surrounding area has also been described as undesirable. As two young girls staying in a city we did not feel intimidated in this area, and is a good area compared to some of the more run down parts of Dublin.

I would reccomend this to younger people like myself who are willing to sacrifice a little inconvenience in location to save a bit of money.

A final word of warning - vegetarians - do not expect to eat much for the duration of your trip!",3,2009,07,07
219,Disgusting,"I stayed wiht my daughter on 24th June for 1 night for a birthday trip to Dublin booked via Lastminute.com in room 153. I was deeply offended by '3 large blood stain' on the carpet  right by the bed in an obvious place, no chambermaid or housekeeper couild have failed to spot the stains ! but no-one had made an effort to remove them. I reported this to receoption but still no-one made an effort to clean up. I have never had the misfortune to stay in such a low standard hote. I have since e mailed them twice and phoned but no-one has botherd to respond.
DO NOT STAY THERE, the manager Victor Cucos does not care about his hotel or guest comfort so do not give them your money, there are plenty of other hotels in Dublin. We do not have to walk over someone else blood to get to teh bathroom !",1,2009,06,30
219,Okay hotel - location great,"After a horrendous flight with Ryan Air (never again) I was concerned it may be indicator of things to come. I caught the coach to the city and got off at O'Connell street, I then walked the short distance via Talbot Street to the hotel.

I checked into the hotel in an executive room. The executive room was adequate, the room was nothing special. The location of the room was the in the basement of the hotel, so no problems with train noise but it lacked natural light. The hotel was supposed to have have Wi-fi, but it was not working the week I was at the hotel.

The thing I liked about the hotel was the location, it was opposite the Connolly station (which also include DART links), close to the tram which means quick connection to the Heuston train station, close to the central bus station and also close to the shops and attractions in the city.

The hotel was adequate, good price and in a great location.",3,2009,06,26
219,exceeded expectations,"myself and my daughter stayed here for the weekend of the Take That concert in Croke Park and I must say it exceeded my expectations. I was dubious about it having read some poor reviews on trip advisor, however at that late stage we didn't really have much option! We arrived at about 9pm and check in was busy at that time. The receptionist, Rita apologised for us having to wait and then informed us that we had been upgraded to a premier club room at no extra cost. The room was clean, modern and very well presented with air-con, a huge bed and large flat screen tv. Breakfast the following two mornings was again a good experience with pleasant efficient staff. The location couldn't have been better. We had travelled up by bus and we were literally 5 min walk from the bus station,10 min from O'Connell St and about 20 min from Croke Park.
The only problem I could see was the proximity to the railway line but all city centre hotels can be very noisy (I know, I work in  one!) so it was a minor thing.
I would have no hesitation in staying there again . Well worth the money!",5,2009,06,17
219,BREAKFAST ??????,"booked into this hotel as it was close to croke park for the take that concert - staff were happy to help - rooms were clean and comfortable - but when we went for food !!! - had food in mcCoys bar - ROAST MEAT  DINNER - consisted of 2 x scoops mashed potatoes - 2 x bits of cauliflower with little sauce - about 8 bits of carrot and small portion of turkey/ham and stuffing not a big portion for over ¬£10 per person - drinks consisted of 1 white wine and a 1/2 pint shandy another ¬£10 - breakfast was no better - melon was freshly cut - pineapple and mandarin oranges looked like and tasted like they came from a large wholesale type tin - the fry was poor - no mushrooms/soda bread/potatoe bread/wheaten bread - the fruit juice was well watered down - the meat was well cooked and had sat under heat lamps for too long - very poor meal for an Irish Breakfast - if the room had been cheap i could have said "" you get what you pay for"" but at ¬£100 per person for 1 nights bed and breakfast we felt ripped off - now for the cherry on the cake - when we drove into the carpark - parking was tight - nice man helped us into a spot - asked for our keys - gave us a ticket with our key number written on it - he needed our key incase he had to move our car if someone needed out - when booking out went to collect keys - different nice man asked for ¬£7 parking charges - well annoyed - no proper signs up to says parking chargeable - no warning form parking attendant - when i complained to warden - he smiled and says hotels catches everyone like this - went to reception to complain - might as well talk to the pet hamster - thanks to TAKE THAT for a brill show - next time i try another hotel in the area - ah!!! forgot to say it is built either side of the railway - say no more",2,2009,06,15
219,There's probably a better place to stay!,"I was not impressed by this hotel. I booked a standard room through hotel.com it was small, cramped and the bed looked awful. Through the front desk I was able to upgrade to a better 'new' room for 30 Euros which included breakfast (although at breakfast we had to go to the front desk and have them call down and confirm our meals). The new room looked nice, but is already falling apart. Tiling in the bathroom was not done properly and screws were missing in overhead vents. Now if you do decide to stay here. You have two options if you stay facing the East you will get a balcony room (at least with a newer room) which is a great way to bring in the noise from the trams that are shaking your room. Or you can face the west with no balcony and a great view into apartments behind the hotel. 

I must say that for the most part the staff was great. Particularly a Bellman who was wonderful and kind. The restaurant downstairs, McCoy's had great fish and chips and yummy cold beer. 

Didn't like that there was a flight of stairs to get to the elevator.",2,2009,06,03
219,nice hotel,"We stayed in the North Star hotel few days ago. The hotel is fabulous, we stayed here before two years ago but never wrote a review about it. Their rates were a little bit high lately until a while ago when they dropped, so we decided to take the opportunity and use it again. We missed Dublin anyway, we had a such a great time when we've been here last time. The hotel got a lot better actually, there is a new reception, new restaurant, gymanzium, new rooms with balcony...in fact the hole place has changed completely. Great services, very good staff (Paddy in the bar is a little gem), good breakfast...,a very welcoming place. 
We even got a bottle of wine for being repetitive customers we guess, which is a nice touch.
We love the place, we'll definitely come back.",5,2009,05,26
219,Great start to our driving through Ireland,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 1/2 days, starting off a 9 day car trip of Ireland.  The location of the hotel suited us just fine as we were only a short walk from the main street area of Dublin and the city bus station where we came in from the airport.  Overall the staff was good, the conciegere was an especially cheery, helpful Irish fellow.  There was a pub/restaurant on site and looked to be pretty lively in the evening.  Th hotel is older but was clean and safe.  It was also very spacious compared to most European hotel roorms in a large city.  it had a full bathroom (tub, shower, hair dryer).  

The hotel also served a delicious Irish breakfast buffet style every morning which was included in the price.  It was definitely worth getting up early for every day..  Wait staff was very good and quick if you needed anything.  We would absolutely stay here again.",5,2009,05,24
219,Great Value for Money and handy location,"A few friends and I were over in Dublin for the weekend and stayed in the North Star Hotel. When we arrived we found the staff very friendly and although we had booked a few executive rooms there was a promotion on for an upgrade which was great value for money and well worth it. The rooms were very nice, all marble and my girlfriend raved about the rainforest shower, not that I know what that means...

Either way the place is really central you can get anywhere from there and it was all great value, we'll definitley be back.",5,2009,05,22
219,Haunted hotel!!,"This place is a once off exprerience!! And 1 is enough.....From the moment we put our feet in it was a nightmare.

Check in was horrible, from the customer un-service to trains passing by to old fornitures and then.....the room!! That was the best part: dirty, we had to clean it ourself as the accommodation department is too busy smoking as we understood talking with some of the staff.

The highlight of the stay was when a ghost entered in our room at aroud 1 am while we were asleep. I woke up immediately as I heard the door and the ghost tured to be the manager of the hotel who was trying to find lost property as he was trying to explain us later.

I got scared and left the hotel. No security, no safety, just a disaster!!

We left immediately and looked for another hotel in the middle of the night. I heard a lot of stories around about hotels, but this guy.....Victor who spoke to me that night should re-think his way of running the establishment!!

Stay away!!!!!!!!!",1,2009,05,20
219,Worse that I expected,"I stayed here on a weekend break with my girlfriend, On arrival we walked through the main entrance up the stairs to the reception |(take no there is no lift or porter available so u have to carry your luggage up yourself,The receptionist was unwelcoming and gave us no hotel information on breakfast times, location etc. 

When we asked about a popular tourist attraction she told us she knew nothing about it and it was obvious she was not interested in trying to find out for us. Customer service course needed I think. Some of the other staff were fine though.Our room was adequate and clean but nothing more. The bed was comfortable. The bath and shower were fine but the toilet did not flush properly. and needed a lick of paint,

We ventured up the town and to be honest its a very dangerous rough area so be careful and carry some pepper spray with you just incase,
on our way back we decided we would try out the McCoys bar , so we ventured in from the street but the  fog of cigarette smoke outside the entrance doors to be hit by a very unpleasant smell in the tired out of date bar . with shady looking characters outside were actually drinking in the bar , we ordered our drinks and went out to the beer garden because it was quite stuffy and sad, were horrified by the clientele out here as they were very messy cursing bad and smoking hash , one guy was snorting something of the table i felt it was time to go , we were quite nervous it was time to get out of here quick, it turns out these are locals.

It was noisy too, we heard music from somewhere nearby (not sure if it was a hotel function) until early in the morning on our first night. Also, we were woken by people in neighbouring rooms arriving back early in the morning, I don't think they were being particularly noisy it's just the walls are very thin.

The breakfast was fine, no complaints there. The location is good to access Dublins attractions but it did seem in a rather run down area,
Overall I feel if it was a very low budget hotel it would be ok as expectations would not be high but it was expensive and for the money we paid it was not acceptable at all. I will not be returning.",1,2009,05,19
219,Willy Wonka  Dark Chocolate Factory,"What a time i had staying here in this Hotel, on first reflection i couldn't believe the colour contrast in the reception area the entrance was like a treacle toffee colour on the floor i genuinely thought it was till sticky,  and the chairs were like marsh mallows floating on top  for some reason there is black paint on all the walls i guess this was a job lot and was going cheap,

The check in was reasonably good but the reception area is very dreary and dark i guess the job lot is still been used here,

The premier suites are ok but once again there a bit OTT, over the top and look very cheap, 
The bar was a good atmosphere but  later was quite a rough local crowd drink here which i noticed on the two nights i was there, i guess its not a place to hang around too long in,
The bar food was good ,
The breakfast was also good but the Wallpaper is an eye sore it actually gave me a headache, reminded me of cigarettes, in a row,
Over all good food bad decor, rough location",3,2009,05,11
219,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Loved this hotel, staff were really helpful, great location and the new rooms are fab!! The beds are the most comfortable i've ever stayed in... Stayed here while going to a concert in the 02 shuttle bus can be taken from the hotel that will have you there in minutes. I' ll stay again when Pink comes back in October !!",5,2009,05,11
219,Very convenient for Connolly railway station,"The North Star Hotel has been continuously upgraded over the years. It is a lot better now compared when I first stayed there over 20 years ago. The bedrooms are comfortable and clean, but the layout of the hotel is a bit confusing (given all the changes and additions over the years). The hotel is opposite Dublin Connolly railway station (the station for trains to Belfast, Wexford and Sligo, plus local ""DART"" commuter trains). Connolly station is also the terminus of the Luas tram line (which runs through teh city centre past Heuston station - the station for trains to Cork, Waterford, Tralee and Limerick). In short, the North Star is very handy for rail passengers.

Note that the DART trains run (every few minutes) on a line immediately behind the hotel; a few rooms have windows very close to the rail tracks. Ask to avoid these rooms if you are a light sleeper. Another drawback is that the local area is not the most pleasant part of central Dublin; nearby Talbot Street is rather grim (particularly at night). Nevertheless, the North Star Hotel offers good value accommodation compared with many other central Dublin hotels.",3,2009,05,06
219,never in my life have i seen a hotel run like this one,"I was a guest in your hotel on Sunday 19th April 2009 along with my partner and a friend of mine who was visiting Ireland for the first time.

First of all I have emailed the hotel 4 times and phone twice but no one replied back to me regarding the matters I have stated below. Coincidently this was the same when I was making my original booking. From the moment I checked in to checking out I was less than impressed with the attitude your staff have towards their guests. 

Reception 

Upon check in the receptionist on duty . I found it amusing the fact that she could not find our reservation on paper or on the system. When the reservation was finally located she was extremely rude in giving us our keys and told us to go to the elevator(never mentioned where it was or what floor we were on). Isn‚Äôt it custom to tell guests upon check in what time breakfast is on and where it will be served? Or is that asking too much?

Upon arriving in my room I realized there was no iron or ironing board so I tried ringing reception and asking for one to be dropped to my room but surprise surprise upon no answer I went back down to reception and asked for ironing Board and this took 20 minutes to arrive..if I had known there would be such a delay I would have brought it back up myself.

Front Bar

We then went for dinner in the front bar, we waited 15mins for menus to be dropped over to us.  We ordered starters which never arrived. Upon ordering I told the girl I wanted no mushroom or onions with my steak or sauce.  When I received my steak  of course there was mushrooms and onions and sauce on the plate. I then told the girl to cancel our starters because we did not get them. Not one word of apology did we get about this. I did not complain because I did not want to ruin the rest of my night. It was only after I arrived home that I found out my partner had paid for the Starters which we did not receive.

Accommodation

I thought the room was fine no complaints there 

Concierge

There was a gentleman named Kieran that sold us tickets for a shuttle bus to the Pink concert. We paid for a return trip. After the concert myself,  my partner, my friend and about 15 other people found out after we waited an hour for this bus to pick us up after that, THERE WAS NO BUS. We then all had to pay for a second bus to bring us back to the hotel. In total it cost me ‚Ç¨30 for a return bus instead of ‚Ç¨15.We then arrived back in the hotel to speak with the manage on duty. He would not take our room number, he was speaking to another Guy and we were in line to speak with him but he spoke with us as if we were drunk and to me his attitude was that he thought we were all drunk and we would have forgotten about this in the morning. 

I assure you I was 100% sober. Upon check out I asked reception what was the outcome of the shuttle bus and she had no idea what I was talking about, also I asked to speak with the night manager as he assured me he would be on duty, or would have it sorted before we checked out. It was not even mentioned to the receptionist and he was no where to be seen. 

 

I have never stayed in a hotel where the staff could not care if customers were there or not.

When my mother and sister checked into your hotel the night LL Divo concert was on and after they told me about their Experience, I said I would give you the benefit of the doubt . as it was my mother‚Äôs birthday I had ordered a bottle of champagne to be put in my mother‚Äôs room as a surprise When my sister checked in they handed her the bottle of champagne on arrival, even do I insisted it was a surprise and, must be left in the room. The receptionist could not find my mother‚Äôs reservation that day either. That god my sister happened to have the reservation number on her and was able to quote it to the receptionist. 

I was extremely embarrassed that my friends first visit to Ireland and I have to endure her in this experience in your hotel.  I currently work as a duty manager in a hotel so know that there can be human error and mistakes made but the above is not tolerated in my hotel and I don‚Äôt expect that kind of service when I pay hard earned money for a night away. 

I certainly will never be back to this hotel, and I definitely won‚Äôt be recommending it to anyone",1,2009,04,28
219,home away,"We come from Storuman in Sweden to visit Ireland for two weeks. We meet our friends hwo leave in Galway and decided to book a trip to Dublin. This hotel was recomended to us by themselves who already have been here. We loved it! We enjoyed the gym and sauna, the breakfast who last until 11am (in fact our son loved it, he doesen't like to wake up early), the staff which is very friendly and helpful the bar, the room... We had a room with a double and a single bed, a good size room, very clean, serviced every morning, with bath and shower and extra pillows. 
The reception staff is not entirely local (as everywhere else I guess) but is very efficient and professional with a ""can do"" attitude and a smile that makes your day. 
We like to say thank you to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable and in special to the managers Victor and Chris who are true gentlemens .
We'll see you soon!",5,2009,04,27
219,Stayed at North Star for Business,"Recently stayed in the North Star and have to say I thorough enjoyed it.
My company have recently started using the hotel for our International colleagues and I stayed here as I was attending a conference in the city centre.
The rooms are modern and well designed,the staff on reception are so welcoming and friendly.
There has been a number of negative reviews on this hotel and I certainly would not agree with them. All in all a wonderful hotel on business or pleasure",5,2009,04,09
219,new rooms falling apart.,"I will keep this brief;
DO NOT STAY HERE
New rooms not finished properly, do not stay on floor six.

Suites are rooms so dont expect to find a traditional suite.

Truly awful experience. Beaware of the cancellation policy, even if you check in at 2 pm and they show you to a room, that does not fir your expectations (suite), and you ask to leave they will still charge your card.
And comments about the rough neigbourhood are very true. So I would not walk to the O2 Arena, one it is too far and two you are likely to be mugged on the way.",1,2009,03,20
219,"Staff could do with alot of training, especially on the front desk","I stayed in the hotel on the 7th of March with my mother as we were going to see Il Divo in the O2. The location is ideal for anyone wanting to go to a concert, as there was a bus straight across the road that went every 20 minutes to the concert and it drop you right around the corner for the concert.

However the front staff on the check in desk were much to be desired. When i went to book in, I had to explain to the girl that I had booked one of their Premier Rooms, and she told me that I had only booked in as bed and breakfast. I had to produce my booking slip, to prove that I had booked in also for dinner for 2 people, but I dont think she would have believed me only that I had been organised with the booking details already highlighted for her to read.

Then the girl told me ""Oh u ordered champange!"" - I hadnt, but my sister had done it as a surprise for my Mam and me, how ever she wanted me to wait while she got a porter to get the champange for me. I nicely asked her could she get the porter to drop it us to our room. To which I got such a look! About 45 minutes later the Champange was delivered to our room. My sister had rang  that morning to make sure that the champange was in our room, to which she got a YEAH YEAH response.The Champange should have been in our room as a surprise, for my mam, I thought the whole good out of the surprise was gone due to their lack of organisation. 

Then I went up to the exective Lounge to see the view from the 7th floor, and surprise surprise my card didnt work. When i went back down stairs to get the card activated, and I got such a look off the girl as if to say why would I want to go up there for, she activated the card for me, and then hands me a letter that my sister had asked them to give with the bottle of champange, I dont think I would have got this only that I had gone done to get my card activated.

We had the dinner in the resturant down stairs, the tables are very much on top of each other and the staff werent very organised, we got our tea and coffee before we got our desert and also the food could have been hotter! The room was clean and neat, but make sure that if you are staying in a Permier room ask for one with a Terrace or Balcony as they tend to give these to Smokers, as this is what the girl on reception told me! NON Smokers like Balconys and terraces too!

Location wise this hotel is excelent, as dart and luas station is across the road and the main bus station is around the corner. 

However the staff need much training, on even the basic hotel skills.",3,2009,03,14
219,Convenient and just ok,"My friend and I stayed here for 2 nights in October 2008.  It was very convenient for Connolly station.  I have to say though the pictures of it on the net are of the 'suites' and not the hotel... Where it is situated on the North side of Dublin it is in a rough enough area...especially at night as we witnessed in the downstairs bar!  The main reception is up a stairs when you enter the hotel, with no lift!  Waiting time at the reservation desk, even to just order a taxi was 'crazy', so we just went out side and flagged one down!   Teh room was very clean and comfortable, except for the 2 couples across who left their doors open to hollar at one another while they gor ready for a night out on the town...so much so that I put our TV on 'loud' to drown them out.  So if youre sensitive about that type of thing, keep it in mind:)

If youre looking to experience the real 'salt of the earth' Dublin, well this hotel might suit you....

Oh yeah, I dont know where the Consierge was...I didnt see him anyway!",3,2009,03,13
219,Stay started off with a fight in the car park,"Myself and my friend stayed at the North Star Hotel on the 25th Feb as we were attending a concert that night. We arrived into the car park and were met by a man who said he must park the car. My friend who was driving parked the car herself as the car park is small and the spaces tight and she did not trust a stranger to park her car. We gathered our luggage to enter hotel and this man told me to leave my sat nav in the car? i said id prefer to bring it with me into the hotel, and he continued to rant that i should leave it in the car, i just ignored him at that point because the situation was just plain weird. He then said we had to leave the car keys with him We asked why and he then became aggressive and told us if we did not give him the keys we would have to leave now. (No explanation given, whatsoever)To say were were shocked my this is an understatement. This man was a stranger and showed no form of ID, for all we knew he might not have even worked for the hotel. By this time several other guests began to question why they had to leave their keys and they like ourselves were screamed at, by this lunatic. We went into the hotel and they explained that the hotel did not own the car park. Weird but we simply did not want to spend anymore time dwelling about it. 

The staff in the hotel and really nice especially the receptionist who was on duty when we checked in and out the following morning,  The rooms are nice and very comfortable. Breakfast was great the next morning. This hotel is only let down by the agressive lunatic who is let run free around the car park.

We enjoyed our stay, but when we checked out we found 'the lunatic' had not only moved the car, but had left the back windows open in the car. He then overcharged us for the parking!!!!Why i dont know perhaps, it was his idea of getting back at us for complaining about him. Who knows???",3,2009,02,27
219,Highly recommended from Allison and Gordon,"My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights 15 - 18 Feb and we were a little concerned after reading so many poor reviews about the hotel.  I thinkt there is a need to redress the balance.
We arrived in Dublin at 9:00am, took the bus to Connelly St (don't even think about a taxi - it's so easy to get to this hotel, just get the 747 or 748 from the airport and you depart at the last stop - the hotel is just around the corner).  We were delighted to be allowed to check in at around 10:00am and were allocated one of the Premier Exec rooms.  It was a fab room.  All staff were extremely pleasant throughout the stay, contrary to other reviews.  I didn't once hear a train.  I think the key thing would be to ask to be located at the back of the hotel rather than the front, where the trains pass through.  
Plus points:  Central location, Bus station just outside, pleasant staff, brilliant rooms, good food, extremely good value for money
Minus points:  Quite a rough area, hotel entrance could do with brightening/cleaning up - other than that, everything was fine
All in all a really enjoyable stay but do ask for a Premier room at the back of the hotel",4,2009,02,21
219,Once is quite enough.,"My partner stayed from 13 to 16 February 2009.  We were quite happy to check out and return home.  Both of us are Irish so know what standard to expect.  The North Star is opposite Connolly rail station and although billed as being in the financial district the area immediately around the hotel is not too salubrious.  The hotel has very few Irish staff so check-in can be a wee bit prolonged.  She was quite insistant that two men should have twin beds but as the booking form clearly stated we had booked a double room including breakfast she was hesitant but did provide a double room.  The bath panel was hanging off the bath but otherwise the room was quite well appointed with a large very comfortable bed and flat screen tv.  At breakfast on the second morning the receptionist stated that breakfast was not included on our deal - she checked with  reception and returned to say that she would ""let it go"".  After returning to the room I took the booking form to reception to make sure the mistake would be no repetition the following morning as we found the whole incident publicly embarrassing.  After the reception clarified that indeed the deal did include breakfast she would advise the breakfast room accordingly.  There was no apology.  The service in the hotel restaurant is not too impressive.  It took 45 minutes to deliver the wrong main courses!!!",2,2009,02,17
219,North Star Is Great,"We headquartered in the North Star for a 10-day stay in Ireland.  The staff was helpful & the place was nice, clean, & charming.  The free breakfast was far above average, and the restaurants were superb.   We were within walking distance of the main sites in Dublin.  The train station across the street was convenient, as were the buses.  Unlike some other reviewers, I never even heard a train.  The staff was quite helpful.  They phoned for taxi reservations for our train trip to Northern Ireland and stored our luggage for the four days we were in the North.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",5,2009,02,04
219,Not recommended,"A friend and i were on a 3 month trip through Europe and the UK and stayed in this hotel for 3 days which was our entire stay in Dublin.
We arrived late from the airport and had no help in dragging our bags through the foyer and up the stairs.
The room we were allocated (twin room) had a toilet that was contuinually running, had a broken seat and an offensive odour.
The mattresses on the beds were extremely old and sagged severely in the middle.
Lastly, the shower nozzle just dribbled water.
We complained after the first night and were moved to another room where the toilet was ok, but the beds were just as bad.
The staff we discussed our uissues with were friendly and seemed shocked but we would not stay here again",2,2009,01,19
219,Excellent,Booked this hotel through Aer Lingus website without details of the name or exact location. Good situation near the bus station and opposite Connelly Rail Station and the tram terminus. Room was clean and warm and the breakfast buffet very good (9.95 euro). Excellent value and recommended.,5,2009,01,08
219,Great Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel 20/11/08 to 24/11/08. The night before we left we read some awful reviews about the hotel on this site so were very concerned.
HOWEVER on arrival we were shown to our room  which was on the 6th floor. The room was large and clean with a huge bed. 
We overlooked the railway lines but at no time at all were we disturbed by trains. We had a small balcony.
During our stay we can honestly say that the only complaints we had was that the room was too warm and that the restaurant staff were a bit slow in the main restaurant, but the food was gorgeous..
We found all staff to be helpful and prompt...we had a problem with our safe and the duty manager came to our room at once to sort it out....very important as we had locked our rugby tickets in it and were about to leave for the match. He managed to open the safe so off we went, on returning to the hotel after the mach the safe was fixed
Linen was changed everyday and everything cleaned and replenished in the room.. We went to use the lounge on the 7th floor but it was not open. On querying this we were told that it would be opening in December andthey were very apologetic.
This hotel is very well situated for O'Connell street and templebar.lAlso for Croke Park
We will stay here again and have recomended it to friends",4,2009,01,08
219,"Overpriced, would not recommend it","Website pictures are not what you get, prices are excessive, no wifi internet except in reception lounge, this is also overpriced, parking is overpriced. Bathroom in poor conditon, not clean, and needed refurb. No mini bar in rooms. We have stayed in many hotels in 15 countries around the world. This is the most overpriced unsatisfactory we have seen.",1,2009,01,01
219,What a dump!,"This is a terrible hotel.  The rooms are small and dumpy and a train line runs right through it.  Every single time a train went past, the room shook like an earthquake.  Luckily, trains only went through every few minutes from about 6am to midnight (yes, that's sarcasm).  The staff were rude and unhelpful.  There are only 4 tv channels and they only seem to work sometimes.  It's not budget accommodation either.  It's quite expensive for a 3 star hotel (I think they bought 2 of those stars because they certainly didn't earn them).  The refurbishments were noisy but luckily, the trains drown them out.  I will never stay here again. Do not stay here.  Pay a little extra and get a decent hotel room.  It's very pretty on the outside and the photos on their website are really nice.  Unfortunately, the photos don't match the rooms and most travellers don't care how nice the exterior is.  I think they get away with high prices because James Joyce mentioned the hotel in one of his books.",1,2008,12,26
219,Not happy!,"A travel agent organised this accommodation on our behalf. Prior to departing we viewed this hotel on the internet and were very disappointed on arrival to see that the accommodation was not anything like the pictures on the internet.  We were not happy after a very long flight from Singapore to London to Dublin to walk into our room and not see it has it is on the internet.  It was clean, but needed severe renovating ‚Äì the shower trickled and water leaked over the floors in the bathroom, the floor sloped away, however the breakfast was good, but again the breakfast room was not like the internet photo.  When departing this hotel, we realised there was a new and old section.  We were in the old section. Recommend to travellers if using this hotel to request accommodation in the new section of the hotel.",2,2008,12,26
219,Good old stay,"My wife Finola and I have stayed in this hotel before but on our recent visit we really enjoyed the whole experience from the arrival until departure. The new arrival desk is just one of the new inovations of this hotel. Although we stayed in the fourth floor (my wife does not use the elevator) we had prrviously stayed in one of the Premier Suites which was exquisit, the ambiance was great and everything was enjoyable. As for the meals and service by the staff it could not be faulted. To sum everythig up it was a delightful break which both my wife and I really enjoyed and would recommend to our friends.",4,2008,12,12
219,Good Value For Money,"I was rather dubious about booking this hotel after reading so many bad reviews about it.  I managed to book a special deal of 3 nights B&B and full Irish breakfast  for the price of 2 for my husband and myself which was a real bargain or so I thought.  We presented  for breakfast on the 3rd morning to be told it was not included for the 3rd day even though I had my internet voucher stating it clearly included this, we were told at reception it was an error from our booking agent.  We decided to pay the 9.95 euros each for breakfast as it was well worth it, we filled ourselves to the brim which set us up for the day.
Our hotel room 151 was out the back on the ground floor and I can honestly say we did not feel or hear the train pass even though we could see it about 75 mts away.  The room was clean, spotless bedding remade every day, towels changed daily if required, toiletries topped up and plenty of tea and coffee.
We had lunch in the bar on our last day which was very good value considering the prices in Dublin.
Overall it was well worth the money or maybe we just had a good room.",3,2008,12,04
219,DREADFUL !,"The website promotes a 3* deluxe hotel.  In our opinion this is most certainly the opposite.
This hotel was undergoing a 'budget re-furb' with no notices on the website.  Intermittent new paintwork just about disguised stale old smells.  The hotel was grubby, chaotic and not at all what was advertised.
We arrived at the hotel at 2.30pm and had booked an executive room, which upon arrival smelt of stale old smoke.  When we politely informed the reception they said they would send someone.  After 1/2 hr no-one came so we went to reception to be told curtly (no apology) that it was not their fault if guests chose to smoke in non-smoking areas and all they could do was give us an air-freshner or that we should pay an extra 50 euro to upgrade.  We politely challenged this and were treated in a very poor manor.  Eventually we got the duty manager to agree to come to our room.  He finally moved us to another 'executive double' which thankfully was ok but had broken bathroom floor tiles which were dangerous to bare feet. If we had not booked through lastminute.com we would've asked for a refund and moved to another hotel..
This was a bad start to our weekend and we felt uncomfortable after trying to resovle the problem.

The only positive feedback was that the bedding was immaculate (thank god!) and there were plenty of tea/coffee/milk.  Maybe the chaotic surroundings were too much for the staff to cope? 

I would not recommend anyone to stay here and this experience spoilt our first evening in dublin.",1,2008,12,03
219,If you like trains!,"Unless you are a keen trainspotter, this hotel is not for you. We stayed there for one night, and were not impressed. As we found out, the hotel is under the Dart line and so shook frequently as the trains passed over the bridge. The rooms were basic, but ok. 

Apart from the trains, the hotel was generally noisy. The walls and doors paper thin and you could hear every guest going past and what they were saying! Additionally, workmen started drilling and cutting at 7am!! Not the wake up call we had planned.

The Issacs hotel around the corner has since been recommended to us, so we will be using that one next time.

I now know why this hotel was a top secret deal. I would not advise a stay here, for any period greater than one night.",2,2008,12,03
219,A good weekend stay.. in the end!,"Well... got a bit nervous about arriving at this hotel after reading some of the reviews but now can see why...

From the airport we got airlink 747 which was good but we got off at O'Connell Street and was a bit of a walk with our cases!! Learnt once we got there that we could of got off at Central Bus Station however still about a 5 minute walk.

We booked this via lastminute.com and got an offer of buy 2 nights get 3rd night free including Irish Breakfast but on arrival receptionist advised that breakfast was not including on the last morning which we were disappointed about especially as it would be 9 euros or something ridiculous!

Whilst being checked in and waiting to see if the room was ready we did notice that when a train went by it was very noisy and the room did shake so I feel sorry for the people staying on the first floor (standard rooms). However, the train became very very useful in getting around. We got a rambler ticket and we could hop off hop on as we liked. Bray was nice as we climbed the mountain, Malahide for the castle and Ashtown for a horse riding in Phoenix Park. The train station is litterally opposite.

When we got to the hotel room we were slightly disapointed as we were expecting it to be a nicer for an Executive Room. Beds where compfy however.

Wifi was supose to be included in the executive room however after carrying my laptop from UK found out that it wasn't working and if we wanted to use the internet had to go to the downstairs residents lounge and pay for a voucher. I was obviously not happy with this and eventually the manager gave me a voucher for 2 days (there for 4!)

In the end, the manager came up to the room and asked what the problem was. We asked if we could be upgraded... and he showed us upstairs to the Premier Rooms... well... what can I say.. they were very nice and couldn't resist! Pure luxery... Very small balcony where we could stand for a cigerette... proper hairdryer... nice bedding, very modern.. also was told there was wifi as well as internet and movie services on the tele... the tele picture was better in the upgraded room however no internet! This was still not resolved by departure! Also was told there was the premier lounge on the 7th floor which was locked throughout the stay.

Once settled in we had a good nights sleep with minimum noise as premier rooms on top 2 levels.. breakfast was nice however not worth 9 euros.

We had a quick look in the gym... looked alright (not that anyone wants to work out on holiday?)

Manager Victor tried to be helpful... must admit he looks a little like a frog and Kierans laugh just makes you laugh! He was also very helpful in finding us places to visit etc.

Temple Bar is the main nightlife area and is a bit of a walk.. about 10-20 minutes which is not nice in heels and cold weather but isn't too bad.

I think this hotel is only nice in the Premier Rooms don't think we would have enjoyed it so much in the executive room.

Hope you enjoy your stay...

Louise",2,2008,11,26
219,Do Not Stay Here...Dreadful Hotel,"Very misleading website, noisy location with a mainline train track that runs right through the middle of the hotel, booked a executive room, that had the worst air-con ever, room was far too hot had to open balcony door but then the noise from the trains and traffic filled the room. 
Do not be fooled by the free food and drinks on the 7th floor lounge as there was nothing available unlike the misleading pics on the webisite showing a fine array and as to the veiws and the selection of food and drink available see the pics I have posted as to the truth, if you are into a run down area or office block then this is perfect, again see the true pics posted. The staff are poor communicators and are only interested if you have no complaints. The duty managers have no powers to assist any complaints with the usual fob off passing the buck to the manager...Do yourself a favour book elsewhere this Hotel in my opinion is just awful and very over priced.",1,2008,11,21
219,ok for the price!,"this was a ""lastminute.com"" secret hotel and they charged ¬£45,room only;
which was alright by us because we wanted a central location and were only there for one night.
slightly perturbed at registration when a train went over and the room shook! and there was quite a bit of traffic/railway noise in the bedroom but that quitened down at night.
given a triple room for two people, with a full bathroom; newly refurbished,no smells and very clean .
not the nicest location in dublin but felt safe walking to temple bar in the evening.
dublin can be expensive for food/drink but if you go to temple bar at lunchtime or at 5.00 to 7.30pm you will get a good deal.we had a lovely two course lunch at  gallaghers boxty house for 9.95 euro (plus 12.5% service) and a gut-busting carvery at o'neills pub opposite the tourist centre for 12.5 euro!",3,2008,11,15
219,Great hotel,"Arrived at the hotel to see it right next door to the Railway station, thought it was going to be horrendous, what a surprise we had, not only was it right next door but the trains went right through the hotel, the reception was a part of the viaduct.  This hotel is great we had no noise and no vibration from the trains, you would've have known where you were. 

It was definately different.  The pub attached to it had made it's smoking room from the viaduct and it was very clever.

All together a nice enjoyable break, hotel is not too far from town about 15 mins walk, and the people are so friendly.  

Although Dublin has changed with the influx of eastern europeans it was a welcome break and would definately go back.",3,2008,11,09
219,Don't even consider it,"This hotel was dirty, in a horrible location across from the bus station and nothing like the photos on the internet. When we arrived and were led to the residents lounge to await staff to come in - we saw threadbare sofas and the smell of the place was musty and not pleasant.  When the train came through the building literally shook  We paid a fee to get out of the reservation and left for another hotel after staying one evening.  The upside and the only thing we can say to justify our one night stay was they did let us check in early so we got some sleep although the paper thin walls allowed you to hear doors opening, babies crying and you literally wondered if someone was in your room.  We woke up and then hit the road to find another hotel for the following day. Some of the staff were pleasant others completely rude.  We were thrilled to leave the place and check into another hotel - the Clarence which was totally worth the price.  I would never ever stay there again or advise someone else too.",1,2008,11,03
219,Pretty good - doesn't deserve the bad reviews,"We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room, plenty of room for 2 of us.  It's in a fab location, around the corner from the bus station and opposite a tram station.  You can get a bus direct to the station from the airport for 6 euros and takes about 20 mins.  The location of the hotel was great, within walking distance of the city centre and all the major attractions and the main nightlife area - Temple Bar.

The reception staff were always friendly - always said hello, good morning, good evening when we went past and were happy to help.  The staff in the breakfast room - great cooked buffet breakfasts too - were quick to serve tea/coffee/toast and very pleasant.

The room itself was adequate and obviously recently refurbished, although the shower room was quite small.  All very clean though, bed made and towels changed every day. 

We had a great time in Dublin and would defo go back - just beware of very high restaurant and drink prices!!!  This hotel doesn't deserve the bad reviews its got on here, I would recommend it for a cheap hotel in the middle of Dublin.",4,2008,11,02
219,Dreadful - Not at all like the pics on the website,"Booked this hotel for a business trip through lastminute.com. 

The photos on the website made it look like a nice, decent standard of accommodation but it really bears no resemblance to that at all.

The hotel is old, tired and grubby. There was a bad smell in some of the rooms, the trains ran past very noisily and the rooms were very basic and generally musty.

Breakfast was awful. We were motioned to our seat by an extremely rude member of staff and found there to be mouldy melon on display alongside dried up fried items.

The website is incredibly misleading as I saw nowhere that looked even remotely like the images they display. All in all, a thoroughly unpleasant place to stay.",1,2008,10,27
219,North Star - boo!!,"This was one of the most unpleasant nights I spent on my trip to Europe recently. After an indifferent check in where I had to fight for attention, I then had to lug my heavy cases up the stairs (no lift) to my quite grotty and not nice room. Bathroom quite rank in fact. Room was terribly overheated and the only solution was to open the window, which let in the deafening roar of traffic. Couldn't wait to get out of there after a terrible night's sleep and highly recommend not staying there unless you are very hard of hearing and like to sleep in tropical heat!",1,2008,10,26
219,Not horrible but will stay at any other hotel next time,"Good rates/location ratio but I will definitely look for another place to stay next time I visit Dublin.

We booked 1 executive double bedroom and 1 executive quadruple bedroom for 3 nights. Bedrooms were kind of old but I won't complain about that taking into account the hotel rates.

Our problems at this hotel were:
The day shift administrative service was completely incompetent...  First they gave us a triple bedroom... we were 4 (and booked a quadruple room)!! We complained and they changed us. We passed from the 4th floor to ground floor. The room had 2 double beds and was far from the pictures we saw corresponding to the executive rooms... actually the rooms from the 4th floor didn't look like the ones in the web either... but the worse was that the toilet flush didn't work properly. We complained and they fixed it by the time we got back. Buuuuut, from then on we were entitled to our own private swimming pool: the toilet kept leaking continuously forming a ""small"" pond on the floor. We complained to the night shift but of course at night they could only clean it, not fix it. Nothing was done during the day since we kept having that problem till the last day when the leakage was much smaller.

Another completely unrealistic discussion was with another girl from the day shift to whom we complained once again because of our ""private swimming-pool"" and the only thing she cared about was that we were four and she stated that there were no 4 bedrooms at that hotel (suddenly I felt like in a strange David Lynch film...). I couldn't agree more with the girl since the beds were quite small to fit 2 people per bed, but THEY are the ones offering quadruple bedrooms at the booking service, why was she arguing with me?...

And finally, breakfast! We honestly didn't remember if breakfast was included in our booking, so the easiest thing was to go to the breakfast room and ask. ALINA, the girl at the reception of the breakfast room was so incredibly rude to us (a ""no, sorry, you don't have breakfast included"" would have been enough...). And once again that David Lynch feeling since she said that we were supposed to be 2 people in our bedroom and I stated we were 4... Were we missing something??

Apart from location, positive words for the night shift who had to go every night to our room and clean our bathroom floor. Also for the cleaning service: we met one of the girls at the corridor and complained we only had 3 soaps, towels, cups and she immediately and kindly added the extra soap, towels and cup.

Conclusion: Irish people are known for their kindness towards tourists... Sadly I have to say that at this hotel there are exceptions to this rule (actually, and fortunately, the only ones during our whole visit).",2,2008,10,24
219,A Pleasent suprise,"Hi all, now here is uor experience at this hotel.
When we arrived, it was raining, met with a friendly receptionist called ""anna""from hungary with a nice smile, we were asked if we would like an ""upgrade"", i asked to view both the rooms, the standard room was perfectly acceptable to me......but my other half fell in love with the upgraded room!! I have to admit is was nice, it was room 757, on the top floor overlooking dublin docklands..a nice sight, even in the rain, we then took the hop/on/off bus directly from the hotel, a nice tour of the jameson and guinnesss factory, trinity college etc...dublin is a nice city, but lots of traffic, got back to the hotel, went for a wee nap, then had a meal in the restaurant bianconi, but its not an italian restaurant?
on saying that the food was quite good(for a hotel)and plenty of it, we then went into the bar,this is not a yuppie bar...we met local dublin people, 1 perticular gentleman bought us 2 drinks!!, he then proccede to give us a history lesson on dublin, we found him to be quite amusing, anyway, we went back to bed.
the next morning we came down for breakfast, it was busy, waited for 4 mins for a table, i got stuck in, all you can eat, did me till dinner time the next day, had a meal in temple bar the following night in gallaghers boxty house, not bad, but a little expensive,
now overall we found this hotel to be a good all round 3 star property, we would come back again....cheers",5,2008,09,24
219,Dublin in the rain.......,"Hotel seems a little old and tired but was ok. Staff did their best to be friendly and helpfull. Did ask for a cot to be put in the room, and wasnt there, but wasnt a problem as they soon got it sorted. Breakfast was average, nothing to complanin about though. The hotel was very close to the bus staion, so luckily we didnt have far to walk to the hotel.  A brisk walk to anywhere else though, bout 15 mins to the centre and 10 mins to the river. A bus trip around the town is worth the money, as you can hop of and on.
Overall the hotel is nice and comfy and clean, just what we needed after tramping around all day.",4,2008,09,08
219,I won't be back,"Myself and my partner have stayed at a lot of hotels in the past two years. The North Star in Dublin was probably the most disappointing. Booked as a 'Top Secret' offer on a well known website, we could understand why - there was plenty to keep quiet about as far as we were concerned. We refused the first bedroom we were put in. It was pokey, unkempt and depressing. The second - where we ended up - was little better, including the exterior windowsill being decorated with a grubby pile of dog-ends accessible to even the most inexperienced hoover operator. But worst of all was the attitude of some of the staff, notably two receptionists who gave a new twist to the phrase 'nothing is too much trouble' - they would do nothing at all in response to requests unless cajoled, even then the attitude was sullen.  Fortunately this was only a one night stay at the North Star and, for us, it was one too many",1,2008,09,02
219,Great hotel!,"Got a real bargain here with LastMinute.com's top secret hotels. This place will be my choice whenever I visit Dublin in future. In a dead handy location, right opposite Connelly station, this hotel had friendly staff, comfortable rooms, a good bar downstairs (the beer garden under the arches is quality). The only downside was that our booking didn't include breakfast but i'm sure, like everything else in the hotel, it would have been good had we had it. Compared to a lot of the overpriced places in Dublin, this place is a real gem.",5,2008,08,28
219,Great Place,"We stayed in room 661 which is one of the Premier rooms. This room is unfortunately facing the DART line(connolly station), which is located near enough to the hotel (well it actually goes over the reception!). You can hear the DART every time it passes, but when the balcony doors are closed the noise is reduced to near nothing. I read in previous reviews that 'the room shook' and the 'windows shook'  every time the train passed. This is a load of bull. Besides the faint rumble of the train it wasn't an issue at all. In all fairness, you don't go on a break to sit in a hotel room all day and night!! 

The premier rooms are newly done (still have that new car smell!) and I have to say for a 3 star hotel the quality was A1. (in line with some 4stars Ive stayed in Cork). The hallway flooring are suspended timber floors and do make a lot of noise when you walk on them (squeeking floor boards under the carpet).

The bed was a savage king sized bed with a duvet that you'd want to steel for your own bed back home. The room also had an interactive plasma TV which was pretty cool and you got some basic TV channels for free. The rest was payable...internet 9euro an hour, movies 11euro each but you had the choice of paying 30 euro and getting all in access. This is a bit saucy just to watch TV but we didn't bother buying it. The cool thing with the TV it had a wake up call thing, so you can pre-programme the time you want the alarm to go off on the TV. This avoided calling reception and was dead handy when dying of a hangover and need to get up to check out. There was a mini fridge which was handy which we filled with pre-clubbing drinks and chucked back while chilling on the bed.

The room that we had didnt have a balcony but there was space to stand out on more like a ledge. This ledge runs the length of the of the hotel so if you wanted to could walk from your 'balcony' down to some other rooms balcony. We had an curious neighbour who stuck there head and looked into our room!! You just need to make sure that you keep the balcony door locked when your out and if your doing some horizontal dancing close the curtins!! 

The hotel has a gym and sauna which all residents can use for free. I didnt use it but wandered into when trying to find reception and it is kitted out very well. 

There is very limited parking on-site.You give the dude your car keys and he parks it for you. Depending on which customers want their car there is some musical chair type car parking going on. its 7euro a night till 11 in the morning and its 1.50 an hour after that. When we checked out the valet guy was missing for a bit and we got nabbed to pay for an extra hour.

We didn't eat or drink in the hotel but we did call into the bar and seemed like a grand place. Didn't have a pint so cant comment on prices or anything. Sorry!!

When we were leaving the hotel to head into town, I asked the porter to pop a bottle of red into the room and he did. He was sound and had was happy to help.

We got the premier room for 125 euro a night and it was well worth to have the premier over the standard rooms for obvious reasons, comfort, quality, that savage king sized bed!! So If your looking to spoil your other half or just want that little but extra then go for the upgrade and enjoy your stay. 

This hotel is well worth the visit and when the Executive lounge is kitted out I'll be heading back there again!! 

Hope this helps you when trying to decide if to book or not!",4,2008,08,22
219,Good Hotel,"After reading some of the reviews before I went to this hotel I was a bit worried.  On arrival the reception staff were very helpful and kept our luggage safe until our room was ready at 2pm.  The room was on the main road side opposite the railway station and was a bit noisy at night.  The breakfast was lovely cereal and full cooked breakfast and also toast if you want it.  The location is very central and great to just be able to walk to the main streets O'Connell Street and Temple Bar within walking distance.   The bar downstairs McCoys had live entertainment on weekends which was good and the bar meals were nice and prices not too bad.  Drinks in the bar were expensive but Dublin is expensive.
All in all had a really good weekend and would  definatlely stay here again.",4,2008,08,20
219,"Very helpful ,friendly staff","We had booked our stay before checking the reviews on this site and were quite concerned after seeing them. We needn't have worried . The staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was spacious and clean and the breakfast was excellent. 
The hotel is close to the train track but our room was far enough away from it for us not to notice. It was especially helpful to be able to leave our luggage securely after checking out of the hotel but before getting our evening flight. The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of main attractions and the bus station for the air link bus.",4,2008,08,18
219,Stay at your own risk!!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in August, with our three kids for 2 nights. We had booked through a promotion agency, 2 double rooms with breakfast and one evening meal. This is not a three star hotel as it claims its more like a one star if theres such a thing. The hotel is situated right opposite Connolly train station and despite being told our rooms were at the back, the train noise was very obvious still at 11pm in the evening and from 5am in morning. The area around the hotel is quite rough and seedy. The car park beside the hotel despite being 24 hr attended is busy, small and awkward to manouvre so don't look forward to taking your car out and in everyday.

The reception area on the first floor is small and has a distinct mouldy smell infact everywhere in the hotel has a mouldy damp smell. The rooms are small and very dated with worn dirty carpet. The ensuites are small with a poor shower fixed above the bath and poor ventilation, if any. The breakfast room is in the basement and is small and sweaty. The breakfast fare was the same everyday, I even noticed a funny shaped sausage in the serving dish 2 days in a row so its probably yesterdays food again today.

The restaurant (more like a room) is small and untidy. The evening meal was poor quality and was very slow to arrive.
The hotel bar is full of drunks and rough types from the surrounding area. We noticed a lot of guests come into the bar have a look around then leave very quickly. The bar staff have to open  a trap door in the floor to access the cellar. Every time they do this the whole bar is enveloped in a musty damp smell from out of the cellar, we even heard one of the local types complain to the the barman about this! 

The hotel guests are mostly foreign backpackers or one nighter couples though it did appear to be busy. We noticed quite a few guests come across the street from the train station to check in. The hotel staff were all very courteous and friendly but god couldnt make their thankless job any easier unless he sent an earthquake to tumble the whole place. However they didn't show much concern to our complaints, probably because they know them off by heart!!.

This hotels days are numbered as it decrepit and decaying and if the owners are reading this perhaps you should do gods work for him, tumble the place and start again. There is a obvious need for a hotel in this location close to the train station and city centre but this building has served its purpose. There are a lot better genuine 3 star hotels in Dublin city centre so check them out and don't be like us attracted by an offer from a promotional agency.",1,2008,08,16
219,pleasantly surprised,"We had already booked the hotel before reading  the reviews and were very concerned about cleanliness, safety etc. 

On arrival the staff were really helpful and courteous. Our room, although a bit dated, was really clean and comfortable.  The staff were all very friendly and the food was excellent..  Our room was also far enough away from the railway track that we were not disturbed by any train noise.

For value for money, this hotel was excellent and we would have no hesitation in booking again if visiting Dublin.",4,2008,08,12
219,Not Good,"Booked the North Star for a trip to Dublin to celebrate my 28th Wedding Anniversary with my wife. On the web the Hotel looked nice and was a reasonable rate. I did see some negative reviews but always like to make my own opinion. WRONG MOVE. I agree the hotel is in a great location, near the station and not far from O'Connell Street but other than that I cannot remember anything else on the plus side. We were allocated a room at the front of the hotel. If you like the sound of trains, traffic and party animals leaving the downstairs pub then this would be fine but if you are like me who likes a little more than 2 hours peacefull sleep at night then again Not Good. The rooms were very small, we had approximately 1 foot around a double bed. The bathroom was small and only had a shower, sink and toilet. Lastly the downstairs bar seems to be the meeting place for all football teams in Ireland and they all seem to like 14 pints of guinness each and to shout and scream at each other.

So to sum up......  Stay anywhere else. Trust me this is an honest review.",1,2008,08,05
219,Perfectly Adequate,"We booked this as a 'mystery hotel' over the internet for a weekend in Dublin. We weren't expecting much given what we paid, and expected even less after reading some of the reviews here, but were pleasantly surprised. 
The receptionist gave us a room away from the trainline when we requested this on arrival, and although we could still see the tracks, the noise was minimal. The room was spacious and clean, but the decor was really quite tired and dated. It was also handy being able to leave luggage there during our last morning before flying home. The toilets next to the bar were pretty bad though.  
I knew from previous visits that it wasn't in the nicest parts of town, but we had no bother, and it is really very convenient for the city centre, and for the bus to the airport. This hotel does the job perfectly adequately if all you need is somewhere to sleep.",3,2008,07,25
219,"James Joyce stayed here, but not for long.","The big guy on the concierge desk was charming and funny. That's the good points over with.

My room was at the back, close enough to the DART track for me to see the pity on the faces of the passengers. It was not just noisy, the room shook when a train passed. The room was also very small, with peeling paint, flickering lights and a revolving soap dish. At first I though there were very noisy people in the next room, until I worked out that the emergency exit at the end of the corridor opened onto the beer garden.

Only one lift worked and then in an entirely random way. When I finally found the subterranean breakfast room the staff there were OK, but the coffee was weak, the tinned fruit was fermenting and there was no marmalade.

Overall the staff were pleasant but of very little help. The place fairly cheap, but not cheap enough all things considered.",1,2008,07,20
219,not bad,We stayed in the hotel and stayed on executive side. Reception staff were pleasant but the noise of the train over head startled us at first - we weren't sure what to expect. we were pleasantly surprised when we got to our room. It was clean and spacious. Chamber maid was very helpful and always said hello. Great location for trains etc but not the best part of town although 5 mins walk to O connell st. We will be back.,3,2008,07,18
219,Nightmare!,"From start to finish our stay was a nightmare!  We were totally ignored at reception on arrival while the manager was with a trainee.  Eventually we were given a room overlooking the busy main road which was so noisy we had to move.  The window latch hanging off didn't exactly help with our first impression either!

Our  next room was on the ground floor right under the railway bridge!  So day and night we had Dart trains rattling overhead and shaking the room!  As it was thankfully just for two nights we made do. Unbelievably, despite it being summer, the heating was on and the room was stifling - the window only opened a fraction!  The rooms are tiny and space very limited!

The breakfast was a plus point, lots of choice, although be aware if you are watching your weight, everything such as milk, yoghurt etc is of the full fat variety!  The breakfast room itself has no natural light and was very hot and stuffy.

Staff at the hotel are not exactly the most helpful/friendly bunch!  On arrival at the breakfast room for our 2nd morning we were met with two members of staff arguing over things going missing and they only paused when one had to ask for our room number!  

Take care also as there are bare wires showing all over the hotel and the toilets in the reception/entrance to McCoys bar are nothing short of disgusting!

The whole stay was summed up on checking out!  We had a late flight so had left our bags in the luggage room - when we went back to reception to collect them there was a gentleman complaining to the manager how his booking had been lost and how his whole experience with the hotel had also been a disaster - topped off by his arrival at his room to find a builder asleep in his bed!!!  The manager didn't even apologise once!  We were again ignored  whilst waiting and eventually had to interrupt or risk missing our bus to the airport!

All in all, we will NOT be returning to this hotel and I will ensure I let all my friends/family know to avoid it on their planned trip to Dublin!",1,2008,07,06
219,fairly good,"pleasantly surprised after reading all the bad reviews.rooms were fine, staff friendly and excellent location.the breakfast was very good.we had dinner there one night and it too was good.all in all a very 'nice' hotel!",3,2008,07,01
219,OK,"I can see why some people find this hotel weird, the layout is bizarre and the the numbers in the lift don't corrispond with the lift display nor the floor number. For example we were told to press 3 but where staying on the 2nd floor, the lift display said something different.

The room was ok, the decor tired and the lighting which is flouresent does it no favours, the bathoom was clean, although some fixings where loose. The trousers press didn't work.  The beds spread smelt stale and could have benifited from a wash.

The breakfast was ok and plenltful, priced at ‚Ç¨9.95 each.

The staff where all very pleasant and helpful.

The bar I would say is best avoided it seemed to be for locals only.

Some people have commented on the train shaking the building,  we had a room on the other side of the hotel so didn't hear this, however this is very noticeable in the reception area.

There was evidence of building work going on, so things may change.",2,2008,06,25
219,is very dangerous place,"i recently stayed here with my partner and was attackedin the bar called Mccoys, i was minding my own business and i got a glass over the head, thankfully it didnt break but iwas told if i reported it i would be sorted out the manager asked me was i ok but he told me this hapens a lot here as they have a problem with the hash heads who frequent the toilets and bar ,

Also the hotel is in a dangerous place and i feel i was mislead by all the false advertising",1,2008,06,17
219,Really good hotel!,"I already had this hotel booked when I read the bad reviews so was quite concerned about what could be waiting for me and my husband.  

We arrived and checked in with the friendly reception staff.  It was right opposite Dublin Connolly Train Station and was only a few minutes walk from O'Connoll Street.  Couldn't have been handier.  

We had one of the new rooms on level 6 to the rear of the hotel.  Room was extremely clean with tiled floors, rich carpet, a big extremely comfortable queen sized bed and a fresh and modern design.  We also had breakfast in the hotel which was delicious.  

I wouldn't think twice about staying here again.",4,2008,06,10
219,Poor Hotel,"Rooms (I say 'room's as managed to change from 1st room because of faulty heating, despite initial claims that they didn't have another room available) shake when the trains go past.

We had wet spare pillows in the wardrobe and the bed was extremely uncomfortable.

On the plus side the location is very good.  

Earplugs are a must if you stay here.",2,2008,05,29
219,Very Poor,"I have to agree with all the negative comments about this hotel. Firstly - yes it is in a good location close to city and once you know about the noise of the trains you can put up with them but it is certainly not in the safest part of town .
My complaint is the standard of the hotel. Like a previous reviewer 2 of our group were bitten by bed bugs and we had checked the sheets beforehand! They were clean but clearly the bedspread and grotty blanket were not.
Also the night staff were rude and unhelpful and don't expect a residents bar to relax in. A few cans kept under the counter is all that is on offer and these are a mad price.",1,2008,05,27
219,Not good,"OK location - about 5 mins walk from O'Connell St. 

Staff really friendly and helpful but that's where the positives end - our room was tiny, excrutiatingly hot (even with the window open), and our ""view"" was directly overlooking the Dart train-line - with a train rumbling past approx. every 3 minutes during the day. 

The bar downstairs was really expensive, didn't eat in the restaurant but the menu looked OK - but again, over-priced. The beer garden out the back of the hotel was really rowdy - got woken up at 1am by people shouting... then the Darts started rumbling past again soon after so all in all - a pretty sleepless night!

Not sure if people have been uploading the wrong pics but our room looked nothing like some of the photos on this site!!!

A word about Dublin - it's incredibly expensive! 1 beer and a JD & Coke - ‚Ç¨18!! Most of the bars seem to be in collusion with each other for over-pricing drinks!",2,2008,05,22
219,Dangerous,"I had the misfortunate to stay in this hotel recently i got the new part of the building and was surprised by the rooms but un closer inspection i realised that there were wires hanging out of the walls and that half the room wasnt finished , the lift did not go to the correct floor because the lift wasnt ready for this level yet , 

whos is kidding who i cant believe the owners would allow this room to be sold 

i checked with reception the  next day and they explained that the  new rooms were not  quite ready yet but that business had been bad and they wanted to get income 

i find this really bad and unsafe",1,2008,05,21
219,What a great hotel,"The North Star should be 4 star in my opinion. I stay 2 nights recently and found the staff exceptional, the room superb and food blinding value.
The location is brilliant and having stayed in Dublin many times I can tell you from real experience that location is everything in Dublin, if you don't want to spend all day/night on public transport (albeit cheap and excellent).
Had a great first evening meal in the restaurant. ‚Ç¨24 3 courses plenty of choice.
OKOK the Dart does run behind the hotel but to be honest it never disturbed me at all. Perhaps a few pints of Guinness helped but I slept soundly in my comfortable bed. 
I chatted to several other guests over breakfast about their time in Dublin and everyone commented that the location of The North Star was superb. 
When I came on tonight to write this I checked out what others have said and was astonished, I really thought they must have been talking about another hotel. I have to say I really dont agree with any of the negative comments and as it happens no-one I spoke to in the Hotel, staff or guests would have either. Great atmosphere, good food, great staff and terrific pub and only 10 minutes from Temple Bar!!
On reflection the only thing that might have upset people and maybe the smooth running of the htoel is the new part thats being built behind the hotel but as thats is opening in June 2008 even that complaint will be gone!!
My advice go check it out for yourself, if you dont you will be missing a real treat.
Cheers",5,2008,05,07
219,A sleepless night,We stayed at the North Star Hotel for a night (thankfully no longer).  Our room was old and musty smelling and the bed was lumpy and extremely uncomfortable - it also came with bugs.....I had bites all over my legs when i got up in the morning.  The room was right at the end of the corridor and we could feel as well as hear trains passing for most of the night.  The plumbing was also extremely noisy and creaky.  One of the worst nights ever.  I would not stay here again.,1,2008,05,06
219,The Hotel that Jack built....,"The North Star is very well placed in Dublin (right opposite Connelly station and a 2 minute walk from Busaras - where all the buses to the rest of Ireland go from) however, this place is seriously run down. The hotel has the Dart (train) running at the back of the hotel, and in the reception and most of the rooms, the walls shake everytime one goes past. There is a pub at the base of the hotel, and is prone to 'sing-songs' till the early hours - so definately a place for people intending not to return until the early hours.
In addition, the staff are as run-down as the hotel - they are incredibly rude and have no idea what customer service is. When we asked for another room (due to the drumming in our room from the air con in the attic, and the brown water from the taps, and a few other issues) we were told that there were only 2 single rooms left and 'I could sell them at a higher price than what you paid for your twin room' - They moved us in the end, but it wasn't easy.
The place is budget -Its falling apart, and has been patched at the seams in a number of areas. The bathrooms are incredibly dated, and are a health risk in places.
This place is only just a 1 star - for backpackers and budget travellers only.",1,2008,04,27
219,Disappointed by hotel and management,"My husband and I stayed at the North Star Hotel in March of 2008, and the hotel was booked through a tour company. We were dismayed from the beginning. The room was unclean, the tv wasn't working, the heat wasn't working, the sheets were dingy and the window leaked so much one night that when we woke up the next morning, half of the carpet in the room (not joking) was soaked. We checked out very early that morning, to get out of there. The smell of mildew was overwhelming, and I started to feel sick--I am allergic to mold/mildew. I even called the front desk that morning, told her about everything, and upon checkout, I filled out a comment card that the receptionist said she would pass along to the manager and get housekeeping to go into the room, as I told her the carpets will need to be cleaned from the water damage. I have received word back from Krishna at North Star, contradicting all of our claims, and saying there is no record of any of our complaints, pretty much saying we are mistaken. For anyone wanting to stay in a clean, helpful hotel, this is not the place to go to. Very disappointed and hurt by the way in which they deal with such matters. Noticed similar comments here.",1,2008,04,23
219,Decent Budget Hotel,"I was satisfied with my stay at the North Star.
Nothing fancy......but comfortable, safe and clean.
I was a woman travelling alone and didnt feel unsafe in the neighbourhood as others have expressed.
Location is good and I wasnt bothered by the DART. although it did go past quite close to my room....so curtains drawn for privacy :)
But there was a storm one night and I thought the windows would rattle out of their frames. Kept me awake for ages.
Thats the only complaint
It is very handy to laundromat and internet and supermarkets.
Also very handy for bus station.
O'Connell street is only 10min walk, so great for tourists.

219,Comfort Not On Offer,"DATE - 26 - 28 March (2 nights B and B with 1 Dinner) 

STAFF - friendly and pleasent

FOOD - Breakfast - very good- decent choice. Dinner - good - not great choice Service - very good

ROOM 218 - big carpet stain, no heating (given a fan heater - unsafe and noisey), damp smelling, terrible decor, 15minutes for warm shower each morning, dipping uncomfortable bed with no real duvet (sheet and a towel type material sheet) and hard pillows, no view and near rail line (although we knew this as location was good)

LOCATION - across from train station (connelly) and 5min from bus centre.

PRICE - Special offer although crap for the room recieved - manager did offer upgrade for future visits (not sure if there will be any!!!!) as we kept complaints about room (other than heating) until depature",2,2008,03,28
219,quite good.....but,"Hi everybody,my first trip to dublin.....not my last,arrived to the hotel late checked in ,got up next morning,had a good breakfast,and ten down to the bar for a glass of guinness,a smoke in the beergarden,which was cold,not like brisbane,dublin this time of year is cold,the hotel is clean and upgrading is going on,the barman paddy,a dear,told me it will be finished in a couple of weeks,no major noise,my room quite reasonable,but no internet access at the moment,its coming i was told,overall a nice hotel with nice staff.good value for money,well located,there is a good irish music and dancing show on at the moment,checked with the information desk at the hotel,i will update on the followiing legs of my trip,cheers everybody,i will post photos later",4,2008,03,03
219,nice hotel,"Nice hotel, all staff very friendly and very helpful. Its opposite connelly train station which also is a DART station and a Lucas line staion. Its appox a 5 min walk to the 'Spike' on O'Connell street and 15 mins walk to Temple bar (a taxi to Temple bar is less than 10 euros).
The hotel itself is currently undergoing some building work which you dont realy notice except at 8 in the morning when the workmen start....saves setting an alarm! The rooms are clean and spacious though the bathroom in our room was in need of updating (prob what the workmen in hotel are doing). 
The breakfast was great, a full irish which really sets you up for the day.
The main bus staion is 3 min walk down the road from the hotel which is where the bus from the airport drops you and picks you up from.",3,2008,02,23
219,"Ok, if you have no place else to stay","On the plus side, this hotel is close to the Connolly Station, where you can catch the DART, and it's also near a Luas stop. So, it's pretty accessible.  On the downside, the DART tracks ran right by our room (see picture), and when the train went by, our room literally shaked. Not fun! I also remember the shower being extremely slippery; I couldn't even stand up. Most importantly, the staff was rude and not helpful. I'm sure you can find better in Dublin.",2,2008,01,28
219,would stop again,"booked the hotel through last minute.com mystery hotel.

i must admit i was rather concerned afer reading other reviews which prompted an email being sent straight away.

the hotel is very easy to find, with a bus stop right outside the hotel.

it could do with updating but apart from that we had a pleasant stay. hotel room clean and tidy and house keeping done on both days.  we did venuture into the hotel bar, fanastic outdoor area for those who smoke. the bar does accomodate lots of the local characters but we didnt have one problem.

i would stop at the northstar again, but if booking make sure you ask for a room at the rear of the hotel, we didnt hear one train",3,2008,01,17
219,loved the hotel,I stayed in this hotel for 3wks straight off and it was great i couldn't fault a thing next time im staying in the city this is the hotel i'll be booking.people really friendly staff and people around Dublin.,5,2008,01,11
219,Renovate the Hotel First,"We stayed at this hotel on the 4-6th January we were at the Thin Lizzy Show,
When we checked in there was very little response from the Large Receptionist Manager behind counter, I had to get her attention and explain we were checking in, which she replied oh sorry I was in a world of my own, I asked for a Iron for my room and she asked me for a ‚Ç¨20 euro deposit even though I had given her my credit card details.i would have bought one for that down the road 

I noticed that even though it wasn‚Äôt busy the Hotel seemed to very understaffed whether it was cut backs or something I do not know but I do feel that if  customers are paying expensive prices they should be given the same treatment as they would get if it was the middle of the summer or a busy period just because its slack surely the customer should not suffer this was particularly noticeable on the 7th January at Breakfast time when there was only one waitress on and she was rather busy making toast making tea and trying to sit people down it was far to much for this and there was a Cook on without a hat which I found bad .

All in all its not a great place to stay it‚Äôs a very run down hotel which needs a uplift I see there is  a lot of renovation going on which is extremely noisy if your a late riser forget it here, I really think the original Hotel should be renovated first. If i had seen the photos of the hotel building site on Tripadvisor i would have not stayed here in the first place.

I won‚Äôt be staying here again im afraid",1,2008,01,10
219,January in Dublin !,"Hi tripadvisors......

We stayed in the North Star for a tribute to Thin LIzzy's Phil Lynott in Jan 2008. The gig was amazing !!!!

The hotel was OK, for a major city the place was somewhat dated and in my view in need of updating.  Check-in was fine an efficienct, and our room, number 112, was located on the front of the hotel, facing the main road at the central station. As I opened the curtains when I entered the room I was greeted by the top floor of the number 27 !!!! Yes the bus, keep the curtains closed I said to myself ....... Bar food was excellent, I had a burger and it was very good.

The room was dated although clean. The TV reception was poor without a clear signal. Otherwise OK.  Breakfast was good, lots of good quality items and plenty of toast !!  The bar was OK, not to expensive.

Location wise it was about 20 mins from Temple Bar walking at a decent pace, Grafton Street and St Stephens Sq 5 mins more. I would say a very good location. As the hotel is near a station, there was a rumble of freight trains going past... There is a gym in the hotel, although i did not partake !!!

Altogether, decent location, good breakfast, dated rooms.

Hope this helps
Lee",3,2008,01,06
219,Average hotel,"I booked this through Hostelworld.com for a trip to Dublin for my boyfriend's birthday.  We arrived very early at 8am and the hotel kindly looked after our suitcases for us until we could check in later that day.  Whilst we were standing in reception I became concerned about the noise as the DART seems to go right over the reception and the room was actually physically shaking.

Luckily, our room did not shake and when the windows were closed you could not hear the DART and I don't think that it runs through the night anyway.  Our bedroom was very large and actually contained a double and single bed although we'd only booked a double. The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom and room was very clean and was cleaned daily.

The hotel is about a 10-15 minutes walk from the main shopping street, but about 20 minutes walk to Temple Bar. We walked everywhere during the whole weekend so I would say it is plenty close enough to all the main attractions.  The bar McCoy's leaves a little to be desired and to be honest there are a lot of nicer bars a bit further away but it didn't really bother us as when we went out for drinks we went into the City Centre anyway.

Overall, this hotel had nice rooms and was good value for money.  However, I don't know whether I would stay again as I would be concerned about my room being too close to the railway line. I think the majority of rooms aren't near enough to it for it be a problem but I wouldn't like to take that risk.",3,2008,01,04
219,Very convenient central hotel,"The North star is well situated, a short walk from the city centre, very close to the bus station, opposite Connolly Station and the DART rapid transit services, and a 15 minute tram ride to Heuston Station. So for travellers it couldn't be better. The rooms are perfectly acceptable, breakfasts are magnificent, there is a restaurant for dinner, and a lively bar where you can get a good bar meal. The property needs sprucing up, but is soon to be upgraded (which suggests making enquiries about work and noise before booking). Meanwhile it is a cosy place with a good feel to it and friendly staff. It ought to be noisy,with trains running over the top of the building, but it fact  this isn't much of a problem and there is very little rail activity during the night.",3,2007,12,31
219,Fantastic!!!!,"I was in a bit of a panic after seeing the reviews on here but I thought the hotel was FANTASTIC!!!! 

Very friendly staff perfect location the trains or the noise from the bar did not bother me . My room was HUGE!!! It was booked for 3 persons it had 2 double and 1 single bed a dining room table and a 3 piece suite and a HUGE bathroom with bath and shower

The breakfast was an Irish breakfast buffet with lots of choice sausage bacon mushrooms tomatoes scrambled and fried eggs, there was also a selection of cereals and fruits and yoghurts. 

I arrived early at around 10 am and they looked after my cases for me. 

Its a 3 min walk to the shops and 10 min walk to the temple bar. The bar downstairs in the hotel is very nice good food and friendly atmosphere there are great facilities for the smokers as the back door goes under the railway tunnel with benches and heaters outside for when its cold

I would certainly book for this hotel again and at the price we paid ¬£70 for 3 people per night its a bargain!!!",5,2007,12,18
219,Great for a cheap trip to Dublin,"After reading the mixed reviews of the hotel before we went, we weren't expecting much. However, the hotel was welcoming and clean, with a nice relaxed atmosphere. The view from the window was non existant, but we weren't expecting one. The decor wasnt very up to date but the room was clean and comfortable. 

If your looking for somewhere to sleep and have a shower, and spend the rest of your time in the city, then this is a good base. The location is great for Connely street station, and is a 10min walk into town.

The breakfast was good too, i would stay here again if I went to Dublin in the future.

* Watch out for the building work at the moment, they start at 8am!",3,2007,12,10
219,no safe,"There was no safe inside the room.
I asked in yhe reception for a outside safe and they had only smalls envelopes for keep valuables.The size was not enough for my valuables, so I had to walk at night in Dublin with money,passport, credit car, cameras, etc.",2,2007,11,09
219,Shut it down!!,"My experience in this hotel is an absolute disaster! 

I walked to reception after climbing a good number of steps carrying my luggages and none helped me at all.
The receptionist was busy eating a burger and hardly paid attention to me.

After checking in I struggled to find my room which was located in a kind of basement sandwiched between a noisy bar and the railway. The room was dirty. I nearly got sick after entering in the toilet. It wasn't only dirty it was unsafe!!

I decided to leave after few minutes and went back to reception where there was an argument going on between the receptionist and some king of supervisor or manager. 

It suddenly exploded in a big verbal fight with insults and I felt unsafe again and in need to leave.

I called the hotel after leaving just to let them know I left and didn't want to be charged but nobody answered. 
I received a bill which after all I didn't want to pay.

As I just said: Should be shut down!!!",1,2007,11,01
219,Excellent Hotel,"After reading some of the reveiws of this Hotel, which I found most unneccessary - read on please

I wish to write to tell you about my recent stay with your Hotel that took place on the 24th to 28th September and to tell of the service and facilities that I had to experience.

As a Customer Care Officer in my last employment and as I fully understand the aspects of Customer Care and at North Star Hotel I could not find any fault of any bad customer care during my stay, this lists from reception to breakfast and meals in the evening and even the cleaner that did the rooms (mine was 362), always said ‚ÄúGood Morning‚Äù, and how pleasant that was, I for one do not degrade anyone as to the job their doing and treat all people equally, here is no exception where this was at North Star.

My 5 days was pleasant enough to return home well and truly relaxed, although my visit was to really relieve stress and that is exactly the break did, and as to people in and around Dublin was so friendly and was nice to speak to me and I find that warming and please rest assure that another visit is planned for next year as I really enjoyed it so much.

My knowledge of the Hotel was from a previous visit with friends from London in 2001 and the stay then is or was as good as my last visit and that must mean I really recommend you Hotel to anyone.

I enclose my opinions as requested by room information and is enclosed

Thank you once again for an enjoyable stay.

After this I can say - yes the hotel was next to a railway line, and yes I suffered no noise.
Yes the Hotel has work being sone to it, and yes it has to happen sometime to inprove the Hotel and yes there was NO noise either during my stay.
Yes thew bar on the ground floor is McCoys and as a bar has people drinking, and as to getting drunk it must be and I tell was a good bar, and pleasesample the food - a need!

I cannot foresee any bad comment with this Hotel, so comments here must be for a another Hotel nearby, most certainly NOT this one!",5,2007,10,26
219,Don't stay at this hotel !!,"Uncaring staff, dirty linen on the bed, loud music and drunk people using McCoys bar on ground floor and the hotel is having major external work on the rear exterior so be prepared for workmen and crane noise early morning. If that doesn't wake you, the trains passing your window will !!. This hotel bears no resemblence to it's web site. Best described as being in 'downtown' Dublin and quite a walk to Temple Bar. It is in need of total internal modernisation. If you chance your arm and stay after reading all the poor reviews as I did, then you must be nuts. Please don't stay there. Bob",1,2007,10,08
219,Oh dear,"We paid peanuts for this hotel so expected some problems  To name a few...the building work started at 8am everyday not 9am as per the website.  Part of the room was damp and stunk, the maids scream at each other down the hall (but then they do in every hotel i have ever stayed in!), the cold tap was boiling and the water cloudy, out of our bedroom window was a brick wall and scaffolding so we felt somewhat imprisoned, and the shower had two temperatures...hot or hotter!

Areas not the nicest but ok and good for walking everywhere.

The only thing that wasnt an issue was the Dart!

If you want a really cheap break then this hotel is ok for that but if u want anything half decent don't do it!",2,2007,09,25
219,Truly Awful!!!,"I just can't believe anyone would recommend The North Star. The noise from the passing trains is ridiculous - the place literally shakes!

Also, the hotel was uncomfortably hot and stuffy. The room had aircon, but this was totally pathetic and just blew out a draft of warm air! Worse still was the breakfast room that felt like a sauna - I had to take another shower after I got back to my room. We ate out the rest of the stay.

I haven't even mentioned the serious construction work that is going on at the moment. Outside of our window was a horrendous view of a 70' crane, coupled with construction workers banging around! Check my video out: http://www.youtube.com/v/ZukUQSlrs9I

Best avoided!",1,2007,09,21
219,Watch the Trains,"On arrival given first room with shower only - the room looked a bit dated and need some money spent on it. With the drawers hanging off i went back to reception to see if i could get a bigger room.

Reception immediatlety accomadated and we move one floor up to the second floor, I did lose sleep over the poor individual that would have to stay in the previous room or could it have been the sound of the trains passing right next to the walls, that would explain the big cracks in the roof.

Stayed 2 night didn't really feel welcome there apart from the welcome from the jolly conceirge downstairs.",2,2007,09,21
219,Im still in the Recovery position !!!,"Just where do I start My experience has left a bad taste in my mouth ever since 
 Reception is unreal.......totally unprofessional it took them 50 minutes 
to find my reservation and I had to pay again even though I had 
pre-paid in internet....still trying to get my money
back.

The hotel has a railway attached to the roof that
makes completely hopeless any attempt to sleep or to die.

I had a meal in the restaurant which can only be classed as bland overcooked and thrown at me, I know I was the last person in the restaurant and could here someone form the kitchen which is adjacent shouting that we were closed at 9.45.
Which I think is ridiculous on a Friday and Saturday night it should be open till at least 11pm on weekends 

I went to the bar and got refused drinks as there had
been a fight and there was Garda everywhere, 
apparently someone even had beaten up the the manager.

 I headed off as it was even dangerous to stay in the McCoy‚Äôs bar.

 
While I was asleep in my room.....Someone walked
into my bedroom and woke me up. It was some drunk
local who got my key for some reason. I have to say
that was really frightening!!!!!!

I complained to reception and got someone to kick out
the stranger in the end. No apologies given, no refund
plus double charged.

Never never never again in this place..........Stay
away!!!!!!!!!",1,2007,09,15
219,Not good,"Stayed here for one night on the 10th sept after recieving an email describing that we may experience some disruption due to renovation work! well that was an understatement.

Continuous banging and tremors from the crane outside lifting onto the floor above and workmen on scaffolding strolling past our window (we were the 5th floor). And all starting at 8am!

Luckily we were there just the one night and had plenty to explore in the city, so woke early....be warned, theres no chance of a lie in with the current  building work!

The hotel probably will be far better once the work is complete, but honestly it is not suitable for anything at the moment. It is very well situated, the rooms are nice and clean but, the staff are so rude it is untrue, so perhaps no guests would be a great all round tradeoff until the hotel sorts itself out. 

I hope it does!

",1,2007,09,14
219,Super stay,"My fiance and I booked this hotel through lastminute.com and their top secret hotels function. You basically get money off a decent hotel but you don't know the name of it. You get told after you book... however if you do your research you can deduce where you are going! 

Anyway, the North Star hotel in Dublin was a more than adequate place to stay. It isn't in the most salubrious of areas but it is not in a dump either. Connelly Station is directly opposite and if you don't fancy the 15 minute walk into town you can get into the centre in 2 mins using the LUAS train. 3 euros return... bargain!  We enjoyed the walking though and did this most of the time to burn off the ridiculus amounts of good food we ate!

The staff were really friendly... we went to check in early (at 11am) when check in time was 2pm. Our room wasn't ready but they took care of our bags for us until it was. This was the same when we checked out. We left the hotel at 10am and came to collect our bags at 3.30 ready for the trip back to the airport. The staff were lovely as were the locals! McCoys bar is great for a quiet drink. We ate out so didn't use the hotel restaurant or breakfast facilities.

Our hotel room was really nice. Nothing fancy but more than adequate, very clean and tidy. Air con in rooms too which as great. We were lucky though as because the hotel is so close to the train track some rooms actually shake! We had a fourth floor room to the rear of the hotel and did not have a problem. We were warned beforehand about renovation works but these did not infringe on our holiday at all. The workman were there 9-5 but we were out exploring Dublin! We stayed for three nights and really loved our short stay. I recommend Da Pino Italian on Dame Street... it seems to have escaped the guide books but it does pretty cheap, really great authentic Italian food and all the locals go there. Brilliant!

I don't really get other reviewers comments about the hotel being shabby and the staff unfriendly... we really didn't experience this. This is a top hotel... if I went back to dublin i'd stay here again no question.

",4,2007,09,08
219,"Convenient, good breakfasts","Were advised that this was not in the best of areas just before we left but we were quite happy with the fact that it was so close (5 mins) from O'Connell Street and easy walking distance for all central attractions.  Rooms v. comfortable and facilites were fine.  Breakfast was very good.
",3,2007,09,06
219,Great Location,"Stayed in this hotel in mid August for three days. I don't really pay attention to the tripadvisor reviews because they have been wrong on most occasions I went away, most recently Budapest. This hotel is fairly old but the rooms are brilliant and simple. We got a very good rate and the location was excellent. The big man on a druken rant is a lovely man called Ciaran who was a great help to us on the trip. He organised a bus tour which picked us up outside and then a taxi for us to the airport. Dublin is a brilliant city to go out in and that is saying something coming from a bogger as I'm from Galway. Ignore most of the complaints people have on this site. If they want something better PAY for it.

",4,2007,09,06
219,great!!,"stayed at the north stat hotel for a stag doo ( we were quite!)
no problems with hotel staff,rooms or breakfast. 
very near to bus station and within easy reach of dublin main bar area's. 
room had air conditioning and were of good size and very clean, 
worth a visit and would go back there if i visited dublin again.

",4,2007,09,03
219,Ignore poor reviews - friendly hotel in fab location,"This hotel is excellent, as long as you book directly through the hotel, you will receive an executive room. It is very easy to find, and a taxi from the airport costs between 18 and 22 euro's. Or I beleive there is a bus costing roughly 6 euros each. We booked directly from the hotel's own website for a two night stay, and got our first nights evening meal included. This was very nice, 3 courses, with plenty of choice. ~Breakfast was also included, and was of a high standard, on a serve yourself basis. Rooms were very clean, and spacious. Double room included a double, and single bed. The hotel is located right next to the train line, and you can hear them passing but it isnt too bad and did not disrupte sleep. One negative point would be the hotel bar - (McCoys), a lot of locals gather and although some are very friendly, they will not allow you to have a ""quiet"" drink! - if anything they are too friendly. Shops and bars are only 10 minutes walk, and the open top bus tour collects from the hotel at 9:30 every morning.
",3,2007,08,31
219,what a dump,"this hotel used to be called the railway hotel thats because the railway runs right through it .  Uncaring foreign staff ,noisy rooms a thoroughly unpleasant experience. We booked this with Super Value Breaks and You Know what it was neither Super or Value A thoroughly miserable dump

",1,2007,08,15
219,Not worth the money,"Booked this on last minute.com expecting good price for what we were getting. We booked a twin room and when we arrived in reception, after hearing the unbelieveable noise of the Dart overhead insisted on a room at the back. This worked out ok as over the entire weekend didnt hear one train from our room.
The room itself was very small, cosy if you like, the bathroom was a good size and well kept. When we arrived the air-conditioning was broken, when we went to complain about this we were assured someone would fix it however after asking three more times, nothing was ever done.
Breakfast was a rushed and greasy affair. If you go down after 9.30am expect cold food and hurried service trying to get you out the door again.
The bar next door McCoys is quite dodgy and I wouldnt recommend it to any tourists as it seems to be for more locals who enjoy showing themselves up and can be a but intimidating at times.
Overall for the price we paid for this hotel we got an ok room, but service and friendliness left a lot to be desired. I will not be staying here again.

",2,2007,08,01
219,short midweek break,"hotel was very easy to get to from the airport on the blue and green bus,6 euros each, runs every 15 minutes from the bus station around the corner. hotel was very well located, staff very friendly,booked on hotel from there own website and got our first nights evening meal included in the price...nice three course meal..breakfast was great,self service as much as you like  ..very nice...rooms where average for a three star,,but clean,yes you are right next to the dart train line,yes you can hear it but its not bad and did not spoil the stay...
",3,2007,07,07
219,Not recommended,"My wife and I booked a double room at the North Star, under the impression, as advertised on the hotel's webite, that our room would have air conditioning.  Upon arrival, we were told that only the ""exectuive"" rooms had A/C, and that since we booked through an Irish tourism website, we did not have an ""executive"" room.  To the hotel's credit, we were offered a free upgrade to an air conditioned room the following night, but we had no such option our first night.  In addition to that problem, the double room was ridiculously small, even by European standards.  It was not a room that was enjoyable to relax in; rather, it was a room that made you want to spend as little time as possible at your hotel.  I would not stay there again, nor would I recommend it to family or friends.

",2,2007,06,27
219,Terrible,"We were given a room in the old wing. The room was tiny and was right next to the trainline, which woke us both up whenever a train went by, and this wasn't a cheap room.

The room was horrificaly hot because the heater was on during summer and despite telling reception many times it took two nights to get this fixed.

Like most people who have stayed here, we complained and were finally moved to a new room which finally gave us a decent nights sleep but couldn't make up for the previous nights.

",1,2007,06,12
219,"Dodge City, the Commitments or Gangs of New York","Our 4-night deal via Lastminute.com's mystery hotel worked out at about ‚Ç¨110 a night.  Overall, this hotel, which looks more like something from the Wild West  is probably below average for a 3 star. Has character (although there is such a thing as bad character). 

Staff friendly enough and location is OK, handy for airport bus, trains out of Dublin and LUAS (tram) north of the city and about a 10-15 minute walk from the bottom of O'connell and Temple Bar, (or a ‚Ç¨6 cab ride). It's close to the shabbier shopping areas of Talbot and Henry street. North of the river Liffey is definitely not as plush. Many Polish cafes and grocery stores, useful Spar/Deli/coffeeshops nearby, and a sinister looking council estate 100 yards away if you turn the wrong  way out of the hotel.

Rooms were spartan and basic but clean. Having read prior reviews we requested a room at the back of the building a couple of days before hand and had no issues with noise (busy station across the busy road) apart from the noise of other guests occassionally copulating, which was barable.

Room had one single and one larger bed, that wasn't quite a standard double  (unless it's for ompalumpas or leprichauns).

Room cleaned and bed made every day, even when we left room after midday.

Ban on smoking in public places (pubs in Ireland have never been so pleasant), means you're likely to be greeted by a load of shifty characters who reminded me of The Commitments standing outside the doorway in a big puff of smoke, especially if it's raining.

Generally, I'd avoid the bar, unless you're undertaking some sort of social study/looking for a fight/to score drugs. Half the ""clientele"" look like characters from Gangs of New York, only with more bruises. One cheeky SOAB pretended to be our taxi driver while we were waiting in the lobby to try to coax us out of my jacket and then my wife's umbrella.  After giving him her umbrella I had to go in the bar after him to get it back!

In general, it's nice to see that such characters still exist in Dublin after such exponential economic growth and homogenisation by British and European retail chains.  This will either make your stay more interesting or a frightening experience.

Personally, I'd stay somewhere else in future (promised the wife never to go lower than 4* after this one!).

",2,2007,05,30
219,beware when booking single,"I stayed at the North Star when I attended a professional exam in Dublin last September. It wasn;t cheap, and needed EUR 90 for a single room per night. To my dismay when I arrived in the evening, the room was so cramped and worn out! What I got was a single room on the old wing. It;s so small that there;s not much space left around after the bed. Even worse it has its window facing the rail line and its so close, which my friend vividly described my room as the station platform.

Of course this is not worthy of EUR 90. I immediately made myself clear at the front desk that this is unacceptable,but they only said they were full and no way to arrange that night.

I grumbled the morning after and they gave me another room. This time it's a single on ?4th ?5th floor of new wing at the very end of the corridor where you need to climb several steps before landing on the door to the room. Because I complained about the noise of the room of first night, this one is absolute silence. There is no proper window, only one at the top. I suspect this is an attic room. The pressure of shower was poor and also the TV was not working at times. I complained at the front desk again.

I needed to stay in this attic room for 2 nights before they finally agreed to change me over to a proper twin room. This one is nice in terms of size, window, shower. and worth a 3-star rating.

Regarding the front desk staff I talked to, one or two are helpful and at least able to put up a smile. The others were rather indifferent, and acted like they didn;t care.

So I guess if you are booking into twin/doubles this hotel can be nice, esp on the new wing. Single travellers... beware they put you into one that is probably only worth EUR 30 or 40. It's really not much difference from a cheap cramped hostel room except that you got ensuite shower/toilet. It's no way to accept trains running literally in front of your face. That noise and the vibrations with it is simply unbearable.

",2,2007,05,22
219,NOT BAD,"not bad for having been a last minute booking!!
friendly staff, helpfull and....ITALIAN SPEAKING!! GREAT!!
THANK YOU 
SEE YOU NEXT TIME

219,"Correct, not more","The location is good, not a luxurious area, but neither a dangerous or no-limits zone: in 10 minutes walking you are in O'Connel st. , and although it's in front of the rail station, we found no strange people around. The hotel is not really worth the 90 euros/night we paid, but taking a look at the hotels' prices in the city center you can accept it. I must confess I was a little bit worried about it after reading some posts,  that's why I specially asked for a room in the new area of the hotel, but they took no notice of it and gave us room 104 (old area). Possibly I was expecting so bad that it looked..... just fine, correct. Ok, not for staying one month, but it's enough for a Dublin short-stay.
",3,2007,05,03
219,Much better than expected,"Having booked this hotel for a girl's weekend away I was absolutely horrified when I read all of the negative reviews.  However, glad to say that the reality was a pleasant surprise.  Hotel is about 15 minutes walk from River Liffey and centre of town.  Yes, it is directly underneath railway line and yes, reception does rattle a bit when a train goes by, but it's all part of the charm and as our rooms were double glazed we weren't disturbed.  Air con too, so pleasantly cool.  Overall this hotel is of higher quality that most 3* and all of the staff were really pleasant, especially concierge.  Would definitely stay again.",4,2007,05,02
219,brilliant,"The location of this hotel was not brilliant but it was well worth it
for us as it is far enought away form the center of dublin but close enough to walk to as well as to any were you need we went for a concert and it was ideal to get to the point depo and then to the temple bar area for a good drink.

The hotel room was very clean however we did have one layer of our double glazed window broken but it didnt not effect us in the slightest as the rooms were spacious yet cozy the breakfasts were incredible more than you could hope for with fruit, full irish breakfast and all help your self 

this hotel was well worth the money we payed for it and the staff were so helpful in getting us taixes and directions to places we needed to go we only stayed for one night be could of happily stayed for more.",4,2007,04,26
219,we loved this hotel,"i booked this holiday to travel with our sports and social club in work. as we did not choose the hotel we were concerned when we read some of the comments made previously.

we arrived at the hotel and were greeted in a warm friendly manner. we had no problem with the reception. our room was lovely, clean and in the new part of the hotel, so no noise from the dart!! we did hear the dart when we were in reception, but this did not bother us as our room was quiet.

the room was spacious, clean and tea=making facilities were all included in the price. we were a five-ten minute walk to o'connell street and temple bar. talbot street, which is the road next to the hotel to reach o'connell street is a bit run down, but we did not feel threatened or intimidated by the locals. 

the breakfast was fab, a buffet with lots of different dishes and this was already included in our price, previous comments re the price of breakfast is incorrect though as the breakfast is cheaper for residents than non residents, 10 and 15 euros respectively.

we were there for 2 nights and on our return from our first day out the hotel room had been cleaned to a very high standard. no chocs on pillow, but hey, it is only three star. 

mccoys, thebar next door is not a palace, and is used by locals, some looking slightly shady, but again not intimidating in any way.

round the corner from the hotel is the airport link and a plethera of buses that will take you virtually anywhere in ireland. the dart is over the road and the concierge is a useful person to have a chat to before embarking on a trip.

on our leaving day we decided to visit malahide castle and grounds. trip price 22euros, we bought a one day rambler for 6euros, paid 10 euros to go on tours within malahide castle and used the rambler ticket to get back to the airport!!! good value. We left our luggage at the hotel and can re-assure future visitors that they now move the luggage to a storage room, rather than leave it in the lobby and you are given a ticket which you have  to hand in to get your case back.

i have been to dublin many times, so my positive view of this visit is not because i have leprechaun dust in my eyes, but because it was so enjoyable, and certainly made better by this hotel,

thank you North Star Hotel
",5,2007,04,25
219,Phew! I was worried for a moment!,"I booked this hotel as one of Last Minutes' mystery deals, then came here and wished I hadn't after reading the reviews. 
However, I've come away very content about the hotel. 
We stayed for one night and I called the week before to check we were in the executive wing as suggested by the reviewers, which we were. I would stress that this really does matter. You are well away from the train line and can't hear anything. Reception is literally built into one of the arches of the bridge! 
On arrival the staff were very friendly, we got there about 8am and they stored our bags and we disappeared for the day. We got back around 4pm to check in and found we had been booked into a suite, which was clean and comfortable and the champagne I had asked to be in the room (as it was our anniversary) was there and perfectly chilled.
The location isnt glamorous and McCoy's isnt the place were you would spend the evening, though I'm not meaning it is dodgy, it just doesnt seem to have character. Really, I've wrote this review to reassure those who have booked here that it isnt necessarily the hell hole it has been painted as. I think a previous reviewer summed it up perfectly as Russian roulette!!
",4,2007,04,23
219,Probally best to stay away!,"Just come back from a 3 night stay there with my mother and have mixed feelings about the place.
One the one hand the rooms were quite spacious & clean
& had British TV, so we didn't miss our favourite prorammes,the bathroom was clean,though a little small, the concierge was very helpful and the barman was friendly.
However:
Breakfast was over priced. As we had not booked breakfast in advance we had to pay the same rate as non residents. There wasn't a big enough selection and what was there was wasn't nice. The service at breakfast was very slow. On our 2nd day it took 15 minutes before someone came to ask if me and my mum wanted tea or coffee.
The receptionists at the desk when we arrived did not seem to notice us for a while. The women who spoke to us had limited knowledge of English and was not helpful at all.
The information pack in our room did not help us to navigate round Dublin, I quote this directly from the pack:
'All buses are within 10-15 minutes walk from the hotel.' It didn't tell you what buses to get or even where they went.
The Hotel was located in downtown Dublin. When we were told the hotel Restaurant was fully booked, after not being warned we might need to book, we were sent out, it was dark and it really did not feel safe. The area is full of graffiti, yobs hang around after dark, we even saw some being arrested. Worst of all we were not warned the hotel was right next to a railway bridge and that the windows could not keep the noise out.
",2,2007,04,13
219,Russian roulette - but excellent if your number comes up!,"Well, there definitely seems to be a mixed bag of reviews about this place, which worried me when I booked it.

The case is that there are two types of room avaliable: 'classic' and 'executive'. If you get 'classic' you get a room next to a suburb train line and run-down facilities. If you get an 'executive', you get it in the rennovated side of the hotel, with a clean room and working facilities. Make sure you check.

As for the train, you can feel it passing every 15 mins or so, but on the 'right' side of the hotel you can't notice it as they have good double glazing. If you're standing in reception the whole building physically shakes!!!

The staff were generally very good - the concierge was the friendliest man I've ever seen, and reception were a little bland and 'can't be arsed' but very prompt to help. The cleaners changed all bed linen and towels every day, and the whole room was dusted and hoovered.

I didn't use the bar, restaurant etc, but for a 3 star hotel you certainly get more than the average place. I've stayed in 4 star hotels to this standard, like the Radisson chain.

Bottom line is - a great little hotel for those who don't want to spend loads, but make sure you get the right type of room!
",4,2007,04,12
219,excellent time,"stayed in the north star hotel for 3 nights, wasnt looking forward to it after reading most ov the reviews on here....didnt dare tell my partner how bad it sounded!! the receptionist who checked us in couldnt be more helpful, told us the best places to go visit, eat & drink. the hotel rooms are just what u'd expect for a 3* hotel (apart from avin' twin bed but wasnt end ov world)! the trains werent a problem at all!! the breakfast was amazing, all you could eat & very very nice. the bar was ok & didnt seem dodgy at all. the small beer garden was a good idea if u wanted to av a quick smoke seen as there's no smoking in bars! overall i couldnt fault our stay in this hotel or dublin...would go back again & stay here. if anyone is thinking of going here dont take into account all what is said in most reviews...at the end of the day its a 3* hotel not the plaza!!
",3,2007,03,01
219,The bus stops outside the hotel - yeah right!,"We went to the North Star in February.  We booked it and then read the reviews which worried us. I had read the hotels website which says the airport bus stops right outside the hotel.  So funnily enough that is what we expected - instead we spent a good 15 minutes wondering around different roads trying to find it.  OK it was close but directions would have been helpful!

We checked in just as a small earthquake happened (a train went past) and I thought oh no the reviews were right. Luckily our rooms were in the newer part of the hotel and were actually quite nice.  Yes the bathrooms could do with being updated but everything was clean.  The only noise that really bugged me were the hotel cleaners in the morning who seemed to have to shout down the corridors and hoover before 9am.  A lie in would have been nice!

As for the other staff, well a smile seemed out of the question.  The reception staff looked permanently pissed off and harassed.  Having been a receptionist in the past I know it can be hard work, but you can always put a smile on for guests and be pleasant.
",3,2007,02,24
219,Not as bad as we were expecting,"We too recently stayed at the North Star after booking through Lastminute.com.  We booked it as a ""TopSecret"" deal so didn't know which hotel we'd booked until the confirmation e-mail came through.  Once the confirmation came, my wife went straight to tripadvisor to look for reviews- & immediately wished that she hadn't!  Despite this, because we were only staying for one night, we decided that we wouldn't worry about it & would look on it as an experience.
However, I'm relieved that our stay was nowhere near as bad as we'd been expecting.  I agree with 1 of the other reviewers in that my experience of the reception staff was one of neutrality- they were neither overly friendly/welcoming but neither were they rude.  There was a slight mix-up with the booking & the receptionist couldn't find our booking on the system (whether this was the hotel's fault or lastminute's I don't know).  However she quickly booked us in anyway & we ended up in a triple room (even tho there was only the 2 of us) on the 5th floor of the 'new' part of the hotel.  The view of the railway line & the back of the old part of the hotel was pretty grim but the double glazing did a good job of limiting the noise & we didn't feel any of the vibrations described in other reviews.  I think the consensus seems to be that if you are staying at the North Star, make sure that you are staying in the new part if you can.  Also, my advice is don't pay too much- we paid ¬£44 for the room for the night.  My opinion might have been different if I'd paid the full tarif price of 195 Euros!
Just one word of warning for all you lovers out there- the double bed in room 555 squeaks like mad!
",3,2007,02,23
219,"Nice, Friendly hotel!","We booked a 1 night stay at this hotel through lastminute.com, then i found these reviews. I contacted lastmin and they told me they dont recommend hotels that are not up to standard. so we went, we got there for about 9:30am and so we asked if we could leave our bags there so we could have a look around dublin. They let us and told us the room would be ready for 2pm. When we went back to check in they gave us everything and told us we had been upgraded to a suit instead (there was 3 of us so we needed 3 beds.), we found our room ok, it was very nice. We had 2 double beds, tv, table ect in 1 room, a sofa and table in the other room. there was a small bathroom and a walk-in closet! 

When i tryed to switch 1 of the lights on i thought it wasnt working then i found a meter type thing near the door, which you had to put ur key-card in to for the electric to work. Think that was to save electric wen u wernt in ur room as the lights wouldnt stay on with out the card in there. The hotel staff were nice, if u needed something they would help out. the safe in our room wouldnt work  but that wasnt really a problem as we were only there 1 night. 

We arrived back late at night and all the doors were locked at the front, its a good job there was a man there to tell us we had to go around the back, then someone asked if we were staying at the hotel, so it seemed quite safe and secure there!, Also u had to use your card to get in. Our window was facing on the the car park (we kept the curtains closed!), we coould see the trains going past, and with the window open u could here them, but from our beds we never heard anything. We heard them in reception and in the loung area, but no rooms were shaking!

All in all it was an ok hotel, not like some of the reviews on here sugested, i dont no if it has been done up or changed management but its fine there!

We had our breakfast in our room which was ok, it smelt very nice wen we went dwnstairs in the mornin, you could smell the breakfast! wasnt impressed that u couldnt have soda bread in the room! lol! 

It was about a 10-15 min walk to the centre, longer to temple bar/Grafton St. we got a few taxis and there didnt cost too much, it was easire than walin sometimes as it stopped silly people in high heals frm moaning! haha! hope anyone else out there who books this hotel has a nice stay like us! xxx

219,Better than the reviews,"We, my husband, daughter and me- have just been to Dublin/Ireland for 4 days and stayed at the North Star. I had read that the hotel was terrible with a lot of noise from the train, cold water in the bath, personel unfriendly etc. Yes the train goes by very close but it wasn't that noisy . We stayed on the 4. floor over looking the traks. We had a lot of hot water for the shower. The staff was very neutral, didn't say anything at all, not even goodmorning, hallo, how are you, but that was ok, we were there to see the city so we didn't mind. The cleaning in the room was not that great but again it was ok. The only thing we missed was the breakfast. When I booked the room on internet in Denmark the breakfast was included,  but when we arrived it was not. 
The hotel is very close to everything and over all we had a great stay and we will for sure be back in the North Star.

219,oh my god!!,"well what can i say except always listen to what you read this hotel is definately not a 3 star hotel im not sure what you are paying for but it is not ambiance, cleanlieness or friendlyness!  Our Room absoultely reeked,the noise of music and banging coming from the 4th floor was terrible the staff wernt that helpful or friendly  The restraunt, well we thought maybe they could reedem themselves by going there for dinner prob one of the worst meals we had ever eaten black pudding in a chasseaur sauce?? what is that all about, we wont even mention the turkey or duck!!! theyre wernt any side knives no wine glasses we wernt even offered a wine list!! services terrible in there, also the bar attached is so rough and old and very dirty.  definately not a value for money a bit of a ripoff would never stay there again and would tell anyone else not to stay there.

219,Great craic at the North Star,"My husband booked this hotel as a mini break....then i read the reviews!, i was dreading it!. We arrived early as i we flew to Dublin directly from working a night shift, the staff on reception were very obliging and let us into our room early. The room was in the new annexe of the hotel and was spotlessly clean and very spacious with copious amounts of hot water and loads of tea and coffee. Ok there was no view from our bedroom window but what can you expect from a City Centre hotel. The breakfast was fantastic and included in the cost of our break. 
The pub attached to the Hotel is used mainly by local people who were charming and friendly and the atmosphere was lively and fun with a band on every night. I can understand peoples views that the pub is rough but i like the company of the 'real' irish people in Dublin. The beer garden is really well designed and heated, built into the railway viaduct and geared up for smokers. 
We ate in the hotel restaurant on our last night and the food was great value and quality and the Irish waitress was charming.
To sum up, all in all we had a great weekend and the hotel was a lot better than some we have stayed in and paid a lot more for.
",4,2007,02,11
219,Weekend Noise,"Be aware that during the weekends, the restaurant/bar next door has LIVE music until 12:30am.  If you stay in the front of the property, as we did, you will hear the music loud and clear.  If this is a concern to you, you should call the hotel directly to book a room and ask for a room on the quiet back side of the property.

For the price, the North Star is not too far off the mark. The staff is friendly enough and the rooms are pretty clean.
",3,2007,02,11
219,All in all not a bad hotel,"I thought the hotel was really nice. A little bit of a walk to the bars and pubs but we had a nice time there. The staff were ok but not great, their English let them down. The breakfast was huge and good quality. The rooms were a little noisy first thing in the morning with the train going by but all in all the North Star is ok for a weekend away with the girls (lots of stag parties staying there too!!)
",4,2007,02,06
219,Girls night out,"After reading the reviews on this hotel me and my friends were expecting the worse but were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel. We arrived very early in the morning and were allowed to check in before the agreed check in time. We booked 2 twin rooms and were given 2 quad rooms which were very large in size and also clean with a very nice bathroom/shower and we had no problem with getting hot water.The view from the rooms wasnt great and the the hotel is not in the best location. It stated on the website that the hotel was in close proximity to Temple bar but it was in fact a 15 minute walk. 
The hot Buffet breakfast was superb offering a full english and a variety of fruit and cereals. 
As we stayed on a sunday night we didnt hear any trains going past but when we left on the monday morning as we were walking through the reception and the floor did shake but throughoutn our stay this didnt affect us. 
The staff were very helpful and friendly especially the concierge. 
I would recommend this hotel for young budget travellers or those in a large group. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would definately stay there again.",4,2007,02,06
219,OK,"I booked this hotel - and then I read the reviews. I was quite nervous and expecting the worst. People seemed to love it or hate it. There are two parts to the hotel. The part in the back seems to be newer and more quiet. I was in the older part. Overall, it wasn't as bad as I expected. Yes, there is a train that does indeed run through the building, making it shake. I am a light sleeper, and still it was not so bad that I could not sleep. The shower worked, but I could only get cold water. Took a lot of hot baths. There was no AC, even though it was listed as having AC on Expedia. I guess booking through Expedia and getting you a ""discount"" gets you the least desirable rooms. I found out that I could have done better booking directly with the hotel. The staff was helpful. Great concierge! Breakfast was not included in my rate. At 10 Euros, a bit pricey, but a tasty Full Irish Breakfast. Non-carnivores beware. I would go back again, even given the negatives.

219,10/10 for service but............,"On booking into the hotel,and checking everything out,Ifound it pound for pound fair value,clean rooms ,good breakfast and in one instance unbeleivable service!.But there are some ""characters"" drinking in the main bar,on christmas day everything closes down dublin is deserted nothing is open except the confectionary shop beside the hotel,not  a good choice if you want to do something,we went to visit friends 11 miles outside the city,late christmas night 11pm no taxis...NO TAXIS..Our friends the worst for ware!!,we rang the hotel for a taxi number..no help there,and then i remembered the conceirge gave me his card,he said if i need anything ring him anytime,now wait tll you hear this...my wife told me not too...but i rang him ,within 25mins a silver limo pulled up uptside the door....a big big man got out of the limo,big smile,it was the guy on the desk we met in the morning....if father christmas was alive,it was him!!!i.back to the hotel....brilliant
I Have stayed in many good hotels,but this..10/10..need i say more?

219,Friendly but noisy,"Stayed at North Star for New Year. Cannot fault the staff, especially the concierge, who were friendly and helpful without exception.

OK the place is bisected by a railway line so you tend to get a lot of noise from the trains, but it wasn't overpowering and they did not appear to be running during the wee small hours.

The room was adequate, clean and tidy.

The bar was friendly and efficient and a great place to spend the new year's festivities.

One note of caution - do not turn left to explore outside the hotel - we were warned that this is one of the more dangerous parts of Dublin - not that this matters much as everything you'd want to see is the other direction.

Overall you get what you pay for and I got an excellent deal, so no complaints.
",3,2007,01,05
219,Great for train enthusiasts with low standards,"We have just returned from a short New Year break to Dublin staying in the North Star Hotel booked through Lastminute  / Travelocity under their ""Top Secret Hotels"" package. We've done this several times before and ended up in some amazing hotels at relatively low prices, but not this time... 

The hotel is located in a run-down part of central Dublin opposite Connelly Station (i.e. approx 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar) not, as the hotel website claims, opposite the Irish Financial Centre - that's a way down the road. The hotel is surrounded by low-cost B&Bs and bedsits.

Notwithstanding  location, when you walk into reception it looks very nice, but don't be fooled! Our room, which was described as a ""Superior"" rather than a standard, was tired, shabby and the standard of cleanliness less than ideal. It is certainly not what one would expect of a 3 star Hotel in a capital city.

The bathroom in particular was very disappointing: mould, grime and rotten woodwork (please see the photos) plus poor plumbing - a sink that took > 2 minutes to drain, and a shower that had so little pressure it was unusable.

Our room was in the new wing at the back looking straight into a few hapless residents‚Äô bedroom windows in the trendy all-glass apartment block opposite, but apparently that's good, because of the trains (see below).

There are two particularly disconcerting facts which, for obvious reasons, are absent from all of the literature provided by the Hotel's owners:

(1) OK Please note the following is NOT a joke: a railway viaduct goes, quite literally, right  through the middle of the original 19th Century building and every 15 - 20 minutes, 24 x 7, the vibrations are felt throughout it. It was particularly bad when sat in the hotel lounge; the chandeliers shake and the lights flicker on and off - if our room had been better it wouldn't have mattered, but it was so dismal and the re-cycled dining chairs so uncomfortable that sitting in the room wasn't really an option. In all fairness, if you're in the new block with the superior rooms, as we were, at least you won't hear the trains in your bedroom. 

(2) the hotel is, in reality an adjunct to a very large, utilitarian and extremely busy public house which serves the local neighbourhood. (I wouldn't presume to say it was rough, but one guest from Glasgow I spoke to certainly did). 

There is a restaurant which looked very nice, with a good menu, however we went down to Temple Bar for meals so we could go for a drink in a nice bar afterwards.

The one positive thing we must say of the hotel is that all the staff were pleasant, courteous and as helpful as they possibly could be at all times. Give them decent premises and they'd have a winning combination!

I honestly couldn't recommend this hotel to anyone until it's been properly re-furbished.

",1,2007,01,02
219,Brill,"We were worried about our stay because of all the negative feedback.  The hotel was excellent and we would not hesitate to recommend the North Star to anyone.  Very good value for money and food in bar and resturant was superb.  A great time was had by all!
",5,2006,12,13
219,Going down hill fast .......,"Stayed here overnight on the 8th December.  Had stayed here in January and had a room thorugh in the new part which was great, so stayed here again.  BIG MISTAKE!!

On checking in, I asked the receptionist for a quiet room - I got Room 126 which if she thinks this is a quiet room, then she had something wrong with her hearing!!

I arrived back from a concert at 11:30 and heard a full scale party going on in McCoys.  The part of the hotel I was in, the music was so loud I thought I was in McCoys!!  I was told this would finish at 12:30am, so could wait.  At 12:45am, I asked reception again, was told to wait another 10 minutes.  Just after 1am, I got dressed and went downstairs - the receptionist wouldnt let me talk and kept interrupting me.  He then said it would finish at 2am.

Finally, at 2am the music went off, but then the fun and games started.   If you stay here, just remember that we can hear EVERYTHING through the walls .......  I dont know how to put this politely ...... but, well, use your imagination!!!  Well it went on for about 3-4 hours!!!!  I kid you not .........

I had an early start so was up and about at 6:00am when a young female, dressed extremely skimpily, tried to get into my room!!!  She was from the ""noisy"" room!!

As for the trains, when they went past less than 50 metres from my window, the whole room shook!!  They start just after 4am in the morning, but cos of the noise, I was up anyway!!

Needless to say, between the music and this female, I never slept all night - I was shattered.  Told the receptionist at 1am I was never staying here again.

My husband and I, are planning to be in Dublin for New Years Eve 2007/2008, but we are most definately NOT staying at this hotel again.
",1,2006,12,10
219,We are in no rush to come back to the North Star!,"This is the second time we have stayed in The North Star.  Our first time was a great experience but not so the second time.  

The noise at night-time is very bad so we would recommend you get earplugs if you are to get any sleep.  

We asked for a non-smoking room and were given a smoking room (with ashtrays taken out!).  

Not all the electricity points worked in our room which was quite frustrating!

The general cleanliness of the room was quite poor.

Its a shame as the hotel is in a wonderful location, so close to the city and the Airlink bus but unfortunatley we will be in no rush to come back to the North Star!
",1,2006,12,06
219,Nice Hotel...better than expected!,"After reading the reviews on this site I was dissappointed that I had booked the hotel, and was worried about the state of the hotel.

My Mum and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at the start of December and we were more than pleased with the hotel. We booked direct with the hotel and got a nice twin room in the new part of the hotel. Although you can here the trains, they are not that frequent, and did not disturb us through the night at all. 

We had booked for Bed & Breakfast with an evening meal  on the first night and it was great. The food was great and the rooms were very smart. Breakfast was good with loads of choice from cereal and fresh fruit to a full irish breakfast. Also, the hotel has a Gym and a Sauna. 

Location is great...over the road from Connelly Station for the dart and the Luas. about 5 minutes walk to the spike and Henry Street, 

Would definately stay at this hotel again....the old fashioned charm of the old hotel at the front leading to a new, clean hotel at the rear.",5,2006,12,05
219,best hotel i have ever stayed in,"just back from my two night stay at the north star after reading reviews i was very scared off what i was in for , to my releif it was one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in and would definately stay here again and the staff in all department were very well mannered and polite and the food was fantastic and location was right in the town fantastic i wish there were six point as this hotel deserves it its a pitty the killers concert was cancelled or it would have been best weekend of my life , this hotel for value for money was amazing and food prices aswell were great  just TEMPLE BAR VERY VERY EXSPENSIVE but great atmosphere hoping to go back in three weeks and will be staying at the NORTH STAR FOR DEFS
",5,2006,12,02
219,Noisy Noisy trains,"This hotel is unbelievably noisy as it is right by a train station and the trains rumble past at all hours. So do NOT stay here if you want to get some sleep. We booked via another website and when asked to change rooms were told we had to pay a surcharge - even though there were clearly some empty rooms in the part of the hotel away from the railway. Our room was cold as the radiator didn't work, rather small and dingy. The breakfast buffet was greasy and poor quality food and teh ketchup tasted of vinegar.
",1,2006,11,23
219,Not that bad.,"Having just returned from a short dublin break, thought I would add my review about the North Star Hotel.  Having booked via the website for the airline I was travelling with and after booking  read the reviews of how awful this hotel was !!- I was very concerned as to what I would find, but also noticed good reviews as well as bad ones had been posted.  Although I was in one of the single rooms on the older side of the hotel, and it did rattle a bit from the trains, I can say that the room was clean and reasonable equipped.  The water for the shower did eventually become hot but one had to be prepared to let it run for several minutes.  Luckily the trains do not run throughout the night so rooms very quiet from midnight onwards. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfasts good value for money.

Area is one that is slightly run down but noticed lots of people walking alone even late at night and certainly no unpleasant atmosphere on the streets however late it was.

Overall good value for money.  Learnt from the hotel staff that the better rooms are not booked out to the hotel agencies - so if booking would do so direct with the hotel - then you can request a room in the executive and more updated side of the hotel.
",3,2006,11,17
219,Intolerable even for a low-maintenance traveler,"Whenever I travel I am only in the hotel for a very minimum amount of time, so I am never very picky when it comes to where I stay... Usually safe (I am a young woman traveling alone most of the time) and clean is it for my list of demands.  However, my experience at the North Star was *so* bad I felt compelled to write a review in the hopes of saving someone in the future from making a mistake and booking here (I was suckered in by the three stars and the low price!).  There was NO hot water two out of the three days I was there (literally - you would turn the handle anywhere near the center towards hot and the water would shut off).  I did get a tiny stream of hot water the day I tried showering at 6am - but 9am, 9pm, 11pm, etc. had no luck.  My toilet would not flush all the way and there was greenish foul smelling water that would make me gag when I went into the bathroom.  The towels seemed haphazardly flung onto the towelbar so they looked used.  The adjoining bar to the hotel was so scary I had to circumvent the hotel every night when i came home.  The guy from the local convenience store came into the hotel looking for me (I had used a credit card at the store with my name on it) and they gave him my room number and gave him ACCESS TO MY ROOM - oh and there is no peephole so god only knows what would have happened if i didnt ask who it was before opening the door.  The wireless didn't work in the room so you had to sit in the lobby (shady characters) in order to use the computer.  And, of course, I complained about my plumbing issues and the total lack of security and as you can see i remained in that room and the issues were never resolved.  This is an awful place with disgusting levels of cleanliness and no pride in keeping customers happy or safe.  The trains didn't even bother me - I had expected a little shaking before booking the hotel - but the extent of the filth I thought needed emphasizing.
",1,2006,11,13
219,A bit unusual but good value,"Having read some of the negative reviews was wary of staying here for a city break. Certainly an unusual introduction with reception halfway upstairs.  Not helped when a train passed overhead as we checked in.  But then crossed the car park bridge and up the lift to our quite large room, Double and single bed aircon that worked and not too noisy for city centre.
Bath filled quickly and was welcome, shower not so powerful. And then breakfast - arrangements work well and the buffet lacks nothing. Very efficient and attentive staff. Have never had such good hotel fried eggs.
Location could be better but easy walk to the centre, very close to air link bus. Generally good experience on city break and value for money through Ryanair website.
",4,2006,10,31
219,Stay here only as a last resort,"Like some other reviewers, I stayed here for the Ryder Cup in Sept. I would strongly recommend staying somewhere else in Dublin. The next time I am in Dublin, this hotel will definitely not be on my list of possibilities.

I am not sure what new and original comments I could add: the trains, the neighborhood, the bar (and the attendant locals),  the bland breakfast bar, the grungy  towels and sheets have all been mentioned in other reviews. But I was disappointed enough in this place that I felt the need to reiterate these complaints.

The most positive thing I can add is that I'd rather stay at this hotel than sleep on a park bench!
",1,2006,10,26
219,Terrrible Experience,"I booked the one night stay in North Star hotel on their website a month before arrival. (two single rooms)
We arrived in Dublin and when we had located the hotel we telephoned the reception to ask where we could park.  We were directed to the hotel carpark.  We were then told quite rudely by the attendant that it was full and would have to find somewhere else. 
After parking in an alternative carpark we went to check in -(I had specifically chosen the hotel as it had single rooms available).  I was told that they had no reference of my booking which they said was the fault of their reservation team.  I was then told they only had one room left, so myself and the person I was travelling with would now have to share a room.  I was very unhappy about this but had no alternative.
When we arrived at the room we were greeted by an unknown person using the toilet in the bathroom.  The bathroom was unclean and the room was also very small.  The trains which went past every 20 minutes made the room rattle!!!!
I have formally written two letters of complaint to the hotel.  However, they have not replied to either letter.
I would not recommend the hotel to anybody.    The service and standard of accomodation is not adequate.
",1,2006,10,25
219,Shakky Rooms but a funny hotel!,"One day or two before I went to Dublin I came across with this website and the reviews about North Star Hotel. I asked a friend to book the hotel in Dublin for us and was very angry with him after reading the reviews. But the others hotels in Dublin in same price average and close to the city center were fully booked.
Then we to Dublin and were nicelly surprised with the North Star Hotel. In fact the front rooms shake when some trains pass but it isnt a serious problem! The front desk staff was very pleasant and nice and in our last day we found a polish recepcionist that speak portuguese!!!
The rooms were confortable! And...oh I almost forgot the concierge! 
Breafeast: Very good (typically english/irish) but the staff that served it were just ok. They are students and were in a roush to get to classes!!!!!
Location: Very good location but don't leave the after night fall. The hotel its close to the main town square and the GPO but the pubs near by have very strange customers!!!

But generally I liked to stay in the North Star Hotel and recommend  it!
",3,2006,10,17
219,Worst Hotel Ever,"I spent 5 hours looking for this hotel.  My partner and I called the hotel 6 times and each time were given different directions. The staff didn't seem to know where the hotel was. One staff member told us the hotel was on O Connell Street (It was half a mile away)

We were going to a concert in the Point Depot, and so had to go on to the concert and then search again for the hotel. 

We arrived at 12 midnight and left the car in the carpark, leaving the keys wth the attendant. When we returned, the car had been moved.

The man on reception had a very limited grasp of English, and asked for my credit card.

We got into the room, had some sandwiches and got into bed.  The sheets were filthy. Obviously, the bed had not been changed in days. We had to take the sheets off and sleep on the mattress.

When I got up, I turned on the bathroom light and the entire lights in the room fused.

When we went to check out, the girl on reception (again with very little English) asked again for my Credit Card.  It turns out that the nnight before I had been just providing security.  We were charged for breakfast, despite the fact we had not been told what time breakfast was served until. 

The staff were unpleasant, and uncooperative. They never even asked if everything was to our liking.

I would never stay here again, and have discouraged friends from doing so.
",1,2006,10,16
219,Ignore the bad reviews,"A couple of days before going on my 4 day break to Dublin, I came across this website and was nearky in tears! I had booked the trip as a surprise for my husband and was upset to hear all the bad reviews. They couldn't have been more wrong. We had a fabulous time at the North Star! Despite a slight hiccup when we first arrived (the window wouldn't shut) we had a superb stay. We stayed in the hotel restaurant on the first night as we were a little weary from travelling but we ended up eating there every night after that because the food was so good and  reasonably priced too. The room wasn't the ritz but it was perfectly acceptable and I have stayed in much worse!! There was noise from the overhead trains but this was minimal and by no means kept us awake. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone and will definately stay there again. Ignore the bad reviews. For the money this is excellent value and quality.

As a side note, the trip around county wicklow was excellent! Quite a few of the tour companies do it but we went with 'over the top' tours and they were very good. Bit of a bumpy ride but a whole day out for 26 euros and a very knowledgeable guide.
",4,2006,10,13
219,Excellent Hotel right in the City Centre,"Stayed here on 04/10/06 with my daughter and her baby.  We booked at that day through goireland.com and got a family room with a double bed and 2 single beds for ‚Ç¨75.00 in total, breakfast included.  Paid ‚Ç¨7.00 extra for parking.

Location is ideal for accessing the city for shopping.  The hotel itself is lovely, and contrary to other reports the train does not ‚Äúrun through‚Äù the hotel, but does go over the reception area.  With all the negative feedback on the site, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The room was very spacious, not at all noisy and we couldn‚Äôt even hear the trains.  The staff were very helpful and welcoming.  The breakfast was a buffet style, and we could have as much as we wanted.  All in all an excellent hotel to stay in and would definitely stay here again on a trip to Dublin.
",5,2006,10,05
219,Fabulous!!!,"After reading the mainly negative reviews, our party of 11 were certainly not expecting to enjoy our stay at the North Star. The experience could not have been further from what we had anticipated. We stayed in a combination of triple, double and a quad room all situated to the rear of the hotel on the 4th floor. All were very clean and tastefully furnished - the quad (apartment) was in fact pretty luxurious. The breakfast was lovely, as was the nicely decorated residents lounge where drinks were served until 4am. All staff could not have been more helpful.
The area in which the hotel is located is absolutely fine and within 10 minutes walk of the city centre. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would certainly stay here again.
",5,2006,10,01
219,Never again when in Dublin...,"We stayed here during the Ryder Cup weekend and it was truly awful and on top of that we were paying premium prices for the privilege (Euro 237 per night).  While my expectations were low just knowing the location (near the train/bus station which often are not the best areas of a city), it managed to even come in below them.  

Having now gone back and looked at the reviews, I was initially shocked to see the overall rating this hotel had, but then realised that the poorest reviews were very recent and are probably an indication of how the hotel has deteriorated over time.

We ended up with a smoking room that just reeked of stale smoke, even though we had requested a non-smoking room.  Also, upon sight of the room, my first thought was, ""I wish I had brought some slippers"" as the carpeting was so worn and stained, I really didn't want to walk in my bare feet on it.  Then we heard the ""rumble"" of the train which I guess we were lucky in that 1) we were probably on the quieter side of the building based on the other reviews and 2) we got up so early to head to the golf course the trains were just starting to run.

We similarly had problems with little hot water as others had noted, probably because the hotel was relatively full of guests so the ""tank was running out"" and the water pressure was incredibly poor as well.  The bath towels were incredibly measly - old and very tiny.  

The breakfast buffet while plentiful, as it was all you could eat, you certainly didn't want to as it was incredibly bland tasting (eggs, juice, tomatoes, etc.).

The only saving grace for us at this hotel was that being across from the train station, we didn't have to add any extra commuting time to our journey out to the golf course.

We surely will never stay at this hotel again.  I have also learned to never to book a hotel without reading the Trip Advisor reviews first (and will definitely place greater reliance on the more recent reviews.)
",1,2006,09,26
219,Blech!,"We just had the ""pleasure"" of staying at The North Star Hotel during the Ryder Cup.  It was far from a satisfying experience.  If it had been a normal weekend with rooms available around town, we would have moved to another hotel straightaway.

The hotel is situated directly across the street from Connolly train station and, in fact, one of the train tracks runs between the 2 sections of the hotel.  (The hotel bar's beer garden is in the ""arches"" under the train track, but this isn't a bad thing.)  This means that you can often hear noise from the trains (don't believe them if they tell you it's entirely sound-proofed).

While relatively close to Temple Bar and the centre of town (about 10-15 min by foot or a short taxi ride), the neighborhood directly around the hotel is not very pleasant (dirty, questionable characters, etc.).

During our 5-night stay, the sheets on our bed were never changed.  While we don't believe they need to be changed every day, I would certainly expect them to be changed at least once during our stay.  In addition, the linens (bed sheets, spreads, blankets and towels) are old and well-used.  The towels are small and very thin.

Our room stunk of smoke even though we had requested a non-smoking room.  We had to buy a room deodorizer to make it bearable.

The breakfast buffet is ordinary with perhaps the blandest fried eggs I've ever tasted.  The orange juice is watered down and served in 2 ounce ""glasses"".

Overall, I have to believe there are many hotels in Dublin at many different price points that would be better choices than The North Star.

219,Terrible!  we had to leave after 1 night!,"This really is not a good place, as soon as my colleague and I got into the taxi and asked to go there the driver started laughing! 

On arrival - it looked rough from the outside and not at all better on the inside.  Whilst stood in reception a Dart - train went past and the WHOLE building shook!  My room was 3 windows away from the track and I got 2.5 hours sleep all night.  My bath room was filthy!  tissue all over the front of the sink.  Would not attempt to sleep under the covers!  

The clientel in the bar and hotel we somewhat undesirable, there was a tramp who stank sat in the reception area and was still there later in the bar! 

I actually put a chair against my door all night! the following day I called my company and got a MUCH better hotel called the Mespil.  Also a 3 star hotel and the same walking distance to temple bar!   Whilst checking out the receptionist was so sleepy and stupid she actually booked us Back into our rooms!!  Hence nothing is safe if staying there! 

Sorry - I love Dublin but that hotel!  ABTA take a look! 

You would be safe sleeping on the street!

219,I'll be back!,"Loved this hotel...ok we didnt recognise it from the outside but the inside made up for it. the staff were amazing, made us feel more than welcome & really made the effort to get to know us while we were there on our stay. the food was great both in the hotel restauraunt & in McCoys bar and very reasonably priced! hotel is in great location, walking distance to everything we wanted to do O'Connell street, temple Bar, train station etc. met lovely people staying in the hotel also, the english fellas & a lovely couple Clare & Philip. as u are not in the hotel much during the day the trains going over head do not annoy you, at nite there isnt too many so u really wudnt notice them wen u are sleeping! i will definately be back to this hotel in the near future!

219,Give this place a miss!!!!!!!!!,"I stayed with a friend in the North Star hotel for a long weekend in July.  The hotel definitely didn't live up to the standard we were expecting.  Firstly I'll start with the good points.  The room was clean and quite nicely furnished (if not a little small), not a bad location and the breakfast was lovely.  

Now to the bad points.....  The room we stayed in was far too close to the train tracks.  Whenever a train went passed, everything shook and it was very noisy.  There is also the bar in the hotel.  It isn't like the usual hotel bar which is mainly used by guests, but a dingy pub which was mainly used by (drunk & rowdy) locals.  That obviously explained the need for key cards to get to where the rooms were and for a concierge to be there through out the night.  It didn't really make us feel that safe!

Then we had a problem with our hot water.  On the first night we were getting ready to go out and went to use the shower and  the water was freezing cold.  We let it run for a minute or so to no avail so we called reception.  We waited 20 minutes for someone to come and look at it, then the guy fiddled around for a few minutes and we had hot water again.

Then the next morning (at about 10.30) we had the same problem.  This time (after a 30 minute wait and numerous phone calls) when the man came he couldn't fix it and said he would have to speak to his manager and get someone in to fix it which could take another hour.  We were only in Dublin for 2 nights and even though it isn't a large city we wanted to go out and explore and we didn't want to spend the best part of the day waiting for hot water.  We went to the reception to be greeted by some rude lady who told us all of the hot water had been used and we could shower in the gym if we wanted.  We asked to speak to the manager and again was greeted by the same unhelpfulness saying that all of the hot water was used and there is nothing he could do apart from wait until it has warmed up as the water heater was on every morning for about 3 hours and again in the evening.    We advised him that we were not happy with the situation and as a hotel for paying guests they should have the hot water on 24 hours a day.  Apparently due to the heat of mid July they could not have the hot water on all of the time because it also heated the rooms and he'd have people complaining that it was too hot.  He didn't apologise, or offer any sort of solution to the situation so he was extremely unhelpful.

Overall I had a fantastic time in Dublin, I just didn't let my stay at the North Star ruin it.  Bearing in mind it wasn't the cheapest hotel they could have definitely done better........
",2,2006,09,05
219,Wouldnt Stay Here Again,"Upon arrival the hotel didnt look very nice from the outside and there were a few rough people hanging about (a woman shouting down her mobile, I mean really shouting - obviously having a domestic) so I was thinking ""oh dear, where have I come to?"".  The windows of the bar looked like they could do with a good clean so that put me off eating in the hotel straight away (and we never). Reception is upstairs - a bit odd.  Our room was number 101 (ha ha), Nightmare. The dart line runs through the hotel - thats the only way it can be described. Our room literally vibrated each time a train went past and you could feel the matress, toilet seat, floor etc shaking. The traffic outside was noisy obviously but that didnt bother me as much as the constant pop music that reception played. i think the speaker in the lobby was on the ceiling i.e. directly below our floor and I had to contact reception each of the 3 nights we stayed and ask them to turn it down.....and they play it 24/7;very annoying and not necessary if you ask me and doesnt really live up to the ""quiet haven"" description on their website. It is fairly close to Temple Bar, Trinity College etc however I felt uneasy walking back at night as I dont think the area is the best. I wouldnt stay here again. The staff were ok - not anything special and didnt make us feel especially welcome.
",2,2006,08,14
219,Hot and noisy,"Arrived at the Hotel for a long weekend, looking forward to our ""Executive Double"" air conditioned room.  

Upon arrival we found we were in a swelteringly hot room on the second floor which had an intimate view of the railway line and some air conditioning units on the roof below.  Not impressed

Whatever we tried to do to cool the room was unsuccessful.  Its no exageration to say it made us feel quite ill at times.  There was one fairly small window, which we kept open even though there was no breeze coming through and we had the constant noise of trains and the aircon below buzzing and sending heat our way.

It was not until the night before our departure that we noticed from up a side alley that it was the block at the back of the hotel that was the ""Executive Wing"".  Obviously by then it was too late.

Apart from the above, we found the hotel to be well decorated and the breakfast was good - as much as you could eat.

But I don't think we would return, as these benefits we greatly outweighed by the constant heat and noise.
",1,2006,07,24
219,Great Location - Loved Dublin!,"After reading a few of the reviews wasn't too sure what to expect.

But this hotel has a great location with about a 10 minute walk into the heart of the city centre. Once you hit the centre every major attraction is only a walk or a bus ride away.

Would recommend buying a hop on and off ticket for the sight seeing buses. These last 24hrs from the time of purchase and you can get on and off as many times as you like. Although you do hear the same stories over and over again!

Guiness Storehouse and Dublin Zoo both worth a visit.

Some people have commented on the supposedly 'shady' area of the hotel but I personally felt safe as there are always alot of people about. It is like any major city, aslong as you keep safe and together then you should be OK.

We were at the front of the hotel and weren't bothered by the trains, which you get used too. If you are out all day and then all night then you'll hardly notice.
Breakfast fine and rooms clean. Staff helpful. Would recommend for its great location and good prices.
",4,2006,07,11
219,It Was Eventful,"Yes there is a railway running through the hotel, however it didnt cause any real problems.
The hotel itself is well decorated and very clean.  We stayed in a two bed appartment, which was great, two large bedrooms and a lounge.  The air con was very effective.

The staff were great, and the location was fine for us, we were going to the Gaiety Theatre to see Riverdance.  I have read reviews that the area was a liitle doubtful, well I was there with two young children and had no problems at all.

Breakfast was lovely, and if you have booked this hotel, dont worry.

We had one incident where a taxi driver, who had an argument, decided to drive his car through the reception at 4.00am in the morning..................the result was chaos, however we were given a free trip to the Guiness Factory and VIP passes, by the hotel, they really made sure we all had a great time.

Would I go again ? Definately
",4,2006,07,03
219,Great Location,"Was not sure what to think looking at the reviews but have to say I was delighted with our stay. The hotel is located in the centre of the city and the with the bus for the airport stoping outside. 

The concierge was very helpful and we could book our tickets for the day trips from him and get picked up outside. The food was nice although the bar won't be everybodys cup of tea. Rooms very nice although I was out the back.
",4,2006,06,07
219,I don't know if we would recommend this,"We read the reviews about the train and were cautious about staying at this hotel. We requested a quiet room at the back of the house and upon check in we were glad we asked. The train literally runs right over the check in area and any rooms that are at the front of the hotel have a train that runs right next to the windows (and I mean there is a train track running through the center of the hotel). It looks like they extended the hotel further back and that is where the more quiet rooms are. We were fortunate to not have our room shake every time a train went by, but it was right outside the window and we could hear it. Closing the window helped, but if it is hot in the room you have to pick quiet or window breeze. The area is central, but kind of shady. I don't know that I would have felt comfortable walking around at night. The room was nice, but run down. The bathroom left room for desire. The room was clean though. We got a great deal on this hotel on expedia, so it was worth the price and again, location was fantastic

219,Great Hotel!!,"We stayed in the north star hotel for one night and found it extremely comfortable,clean, friendly and only 5 mins walk from o connell street to boot! Staff were on hand to deal with any queries efficiently and showed great customer realtions.
",4,2006,04,02
219,Staff were great,"Luckily I read some reviews before booking and asked for a room at the back of the hotel as when i booked in a train went over the top of the hotel and reception is directly underneath the track.  The whole reception area shook.

Staff were very helpful and informative. Very clean.

Used the well equiped gym but unfortunately the Sauna was cold.",4,2006,03,27
219,Do not get a front room,"If you choose to stay here make sure you get a room up the back of the hotel. There was nothing pleasant about my room. I had a room on the second floor at the front of the hotel and I could hear every train and car that went past and when the trains went past the entire room vibrated. The room was also very warm and due to the noise I was unable to open the window to cool it down.

I had dinner at the hotel restaurant and would not recommend it. My food was undercooked and not very warm. Breakfast was better.

The location was great, just a short walk down the road to O'Connell Street and very good location for airport transport.

Good price for accommodation in Dublin but not worth it if you are in a room at the front of the hotel.
",2,2006,03,27
219,On Tour to Dublin,"We stayed at The North Star during the Six Nations Championship to see Ireland v Wales.  We liked the location of the hotel being 5 minutes walk from O'Connell Street and 10 minutes to Temple Bar.  The bar attached to the hotel was very welcoming and served a excellent pint of Guiness.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  We were disappointed with our room as we requested a non smoking room which was fine but smoke from the adjoining room came through the bathroom vent everytime the guest next door smoked!  The breakfast was fine but expensive and the manner of the member of staff that showed us to our table was very abrupt as she was not Irish! Really enjoyed our weekend in Dublin though and will be back.
",3,2006,03,23
219,Don't worry,"I read some of the other reviews and they worried me greatly. I guess there are rooms near the railway line but it is a big hotel; you will be able to move if you ask the reception nicely. The hotel rooms were decent, everything you would want. Breakfasts good also, though slightly chaotic.
",4,2006,03,18
219,Great hotel- we had a back room though!,"We had a great stay here- our original room was on the front and non-smoking, but as the room had a smoky smell, we were upgraded to a lovely room in the much quieter back part of the hotel.

The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was great with the rugby in the city.

I would recommend this hotel for a cheap, comfortable break.  The walk into town is not long at all, but Talbot Street is a little seedy.  Also avoid the attached bar (McCoys) at the weekend, it gets a little busy...

Great hotel!

219,Pleasently Surprised,"Well, after reading all the other early reviews post booking - and it was a valentines surprise for the wife..without the 5 kids ... I was lets say hopeful..
But I can say this was a great little hotel, cheery staff - food good, beer cheaper than temple bar!! with excellent transport links,
748 drops off and picks up from the airport, 1st stop!!
Connelly St station(Dart) across the rd,
Tram point 100 yards down the rd - sandyford easily commutable.
yes the outside could do with a lick of paint and it can be noisy at times - but they seem to be making an effort, fresh paint smells and new carpets being fitted in just the 2 days we spent there.
Its value for money in a growing city.
Rooms clean, I booked a twin and got an upgrade to a superior room free of charge - just ask - you have nothing to lose.
Recomended eating places - Elephant & castle Temple Bar (checkout the chicken wings yummmmy!)
And if you have time get the DART to Howth (3.5 euros return) and check out the King Sitric - great fish resturant straight from the harbour fleet!! not cheap but quality food

219,Clean and central - 15 min walk to Temple Bar,"Re: The North Star Hotel, Dublin.

The hotel was fine. It is close to the city centre, not more than 15 min walk to Temple Bar. 

My room was clean. I got upgraded free of charge. You know, it was the usual thing when booking throught lastminute. There is no guarantee of getting a non-smoking room even if you ask for one when booking. So, this time I was lucky and got a room without smoke. 

Some people may think a few streets nearby the hotel are somewhat run down. I dont think it is too bad, compared to any big British city. In addition, there were plenty of people around on the streets during the evening so the area felt perfectly safe, at least before 10pm.

Downsides: Rooms towards the street are probably quite noisy. Irish breakfast is almost 10 Euros extra.

219,The wrong side of Town,"After reading the reviews i was not expecting the Ritz, so myself and my  friends all female were set for a good girlie weekend.
On arrival the outside of the hotel left a lot to be desired, inside reception was nice and clean and things seemed to be ok until the train went passed/through the hotel.
We had an excutive suite which was nice but very basic and our room was overlooked by what seemed to be the staff's outside smoking area so we kept our curtains shut, but we could not hear the train in the room.
There was no hotel bar, it was the pub next door with a door into the hotel.
As we went to the local shops we soon realised that this was by no means a safe area to be alone night or day, during the weekend various people advised us not to walk back to hotel at night, which i would never have done anyway, taxis are very frequent and only 8 Euros to temple bar.
The only food we had was room service very late one night, this was very nice and resonably priced.
Overall staff very freindly, the place was clean - but noisy, and the wrong side of town !!
",2,2006,02,08
219,poland,"Having never been to dublin before we didn't really know where to stay, so we opted for the cheapest yet closest to city option we could find. Hence the North Star.

On arrival at 1pm we were told we could not check in until 2 but could however leave our bags. No problem we thought, so off to the nearest pub. We came back at 2 and in order to reclaim our luggage had to search through some dirty looking broom cupboard. 

We then made our way to our room, which was on the 2nd floor, at the front/side. Room was very small, fairly dated, but clean, so we were happy. Until we heard the trains. They sounded as if they were actually in our room. On looking out of the window, they almost were. No more than 3 meters of fresh air separated us from the finest Dublin trains, all travelling at great speed. My girlfriend is a lightweight, and was feeling the effects of a heavy night, and as such wanted some sleep. I left her, went to the pub and returned 1 hour later, to find an equally tired girl. The trains were so noisy not even my girlfriend could sleep. I knew then that they were loud. I looked again at the tracks in the vain hope to see if they had moved any further away. They hadn't, but what I did notice was that the window was damaged and was clsoed properly. I tried to fix it, but to no avail. I was alarmed at the prospect of having to put up with my sleepless girlfriend for 2 nights, so I headed for the reception. After trying, and failing, to make myself understood with the Polish receptionist, I was assisted by perhaps the only Irish person in the whole of the hotel. I explained my situation, and was happily told we could not only move rooms but would be upgraded to an 'executive suite'. 

The executive suite was far from executive, but it was at least quiet and large. It was fairly basic, but again clean, tidy and very comfortable.

We opted to eat in the restaurant, which in hindsight was a mistake. The cold, draft, drab frankly univiting dining room was largely in keeping with the food. Not bad value, but certainly wouldn't eat there again.

All in all the hotel was largley what we paid for, and in fact expected. Not 5 star living by any chance, but so long as you avoid the rooms in the train station, oh and the dinners, you can't really complain.

Oh and the hotel may as well have been in poland. Loads of polish people, and a rather big pole situated at the end of the road.

219,Great for Train Spotters,"Visited the Dublin Hotel North Star for a long weekend break on 13th January.  Booked hotel through internet website and was under the impression I was booking room and breakfast.  Apparently not.  Just the room, so had to pay for breakfast for three days for 2 of us which increased the price of the break. Had to pay 9.95 euros each.  Hotel was more than a 10 minute walk into the centre of Dublin, more like 20 mins.  Was nicely placed for bus route to Airport, the stop was outside the hotel.  We were lucky to have a room on the fifth floor in the newer part of the hotel.  We overlooked a railway line which appeared to go through the centre of the hotel!  Great for train spotters! Room was a good size.   Bar in hotel McCoys was good but drinks were pricey.  They had live music over the weekend we were there, an elvis impersonator on the Saturday and an irish version of karaoke which was singing with the duo on a Sunday evening.  Would have appreciated irish music but we travelled down to temple bar to see this.  Beware of extreme bar prices in this area!  Pubs mostly full of american tourists very little irish locals to be seen!  Would recommend the North Star Hotel but would like to see breakfast included in the price through the internet booking websites as an option.
",3,2006,01,19
219,Good Value Hotel,"After reading the mixed reviews was very unsure about this hotel, especially when I had booked it for a group of 24 of us, but after letting the reception manager know before we arrived that I would like nice rooms, she didn't let us down.  All of our rooms were located away from the noise of the trains and were very nice for a short stay - especially when we are hardly in them.  Nobody had any complaints and most of us had larger triple rooms for double occupancy, so even more space. I would recommend always asking for a quieter room.  Breakfast was good and the concierge was excellent - what a character.  If you need any tour bus tickets, restaurant bookings or taxi back to the airport - ask him - he has very good prices!

Word of warning about taxis - we had six taxis from the airport and they ranged from costing 18 euros to 36 euros for exactly the same journey. (Normal price for 4 people should be no more than 25 euros).  The airport express coach stops straight in front of the hotel so that is a good option.

Hotel bar was good and the bar snacks looked acceptable.  Didn't see anybody in main restaurant.

Location of hotel is quite central, even though it is a good 15 to 20 minutes to the Temple Bar Area, but I have stayed in hotels in that area before and I will defiantely use the North Star again as there was no 'boom boom' of music until the early hours and if you have had one two many pints of Guinness, the taxi ride is short, but there are loads of pubs and restaurants close to the hotel - but you need to try Temple Bar at least once !

All in all - good, adequate hotel for a bargain price.
",4,2006,01,10
219,Good Value,"We stayed 2 nights in Jan 2006, visiting for the James Blunt concert.  We got a deal on lastminute, not knowing where we were staying until after we booked.

We were a bit worried having read some of the reviews, once we found out where we were staying, but were pleasantly surprised, in the end.  The room was in the wing to the rear of the building and we didn't get any traffic or train noise.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable.  We did, however, have difficulty getting the a/c on the correct setting and didn't find any instructions in the room.  In addition, the previous comments regarding the weak water pressure in the shower were correct.

We had a good night in the bar and the entertainment was good.

Overall, it was good value for money, although some distance from the main areas-Temple Bar, Grafton Street etc although the location for The Point (concert venue) was ok-about 20 minute walk.  If we return to Dublin we would probably stay there again-assuming we could get the deal!
",4,2006,01,09
219,Poor stay at the North Star,"Booked two nights at the North Star for ¬£35 a night on last minute. Bargain! but came at a price. The bog 'standard' rooms included in this offer were either at the front of the hotel with all the awful traffic noise. Or at the side/rear, right on top practically of the rail/dart line. Room was small and a smoking room (we were not offered non-smoking) and was very stuffy indeed. The hot water pipes were too hot to touch and as a result our room (even with the radiator off) was like a sauna. There was no air conditioning despite the room being advertised WITH air con - the receptionist said that this was a mistake and would contact her marketing department! Couldn't open our window due to the loud train noise. Very frequent trains in morning rush hour starting around 7am so no nice lie in, and trains didn't actually stop until well gone 11-11.30. Also woken on first night by very roudy and drunk neighbours - walls very thin! We tried to get moved after putting up with it for one night - told hotel was full and should have said earlier! So let that be a lesson - complain straight away and do not hestitate. On the plus side friendly staff, lovely conceirge, ideal location for good transport links - although bus was running very late getting us back to airport! Also we ate in the hotel pub which we found to offer very nice food and a very cheap price.

219,"Average hotel,   good breakfast","Having already had an hours delay on our flight from London, we arrived at the hotel at about 9pm. We were hungry and once we had checked into our room, we went to the bar to try to get some food, we were too late as they had already stopped serving. The barman suggested we went to the Spar shop next door and we got a sandwich, not a great start.

Our room was quite large, with a double bed and a single also in it. Our room was at the back of the hotel on the second floor and we overlooked a newly built apartment block. The bed was comfortable and there were 2 chairs, a table, a dressing table with hairdryer, a tv, tea/coffee making facilities, a decent sized wardrobe and a safe. I have to say though, the shower wasn't great, the water pressure was quite weak, the towels were small and there was only a small bar of soap and a little bottle of something else supplied.

The breakfast on both mornings was lovely, buffet style with plenty of piping hot food with a good choice of cereals and fresh fruit.

The hotel was situated further from the main shopping area/Temple Bar than we had realised when we booked and after walking there and back during the day, we couldn't be bothered to wrap up warm and do it again so we decided to eat in the Bianconi restaurant in the hotel. This was a mistake. We ordered a bottle of wine then had to wait some time to get it, even then we had to ask again for it. It was a while before our order was taken and when it came, it wasn't very impressive. I had cream of chicken soup which didn't taste as good as Heinz tinned. I then had duck, which was average. My husband was equally under-whelmed with his food. Whilst I was in the bar, the dessert menu was brought and my husband ordered his dessert. The menu was left for me to choose mine but no-one appeared to take my order, so I didn't bother. The  ladies at the next table didn't have all their cutlery and had to ask for glasses so they could drink their water.

The barstaff were very friendly and helpful, as was the concierge, pity the reception staff weren't as welcoming as they might have been.

For those getting the bus to the airport, the bus stop for the No.748 stops right outside the hotel. We paid 5 Euro each which was very reasonable.

Overall, for a 3 star hotel it was average. I wouldn't stay there again though, that said, it was reasonably priced but I've stayed in better 3 star hotels for less money.
",3,2005,11,28
219,Quirky but comfortable,"This place reminded me of a bygone era. Stylish interior decor reminiscent of the 1940's. Don't be put off by the exceptionally close vicinity of the railway line (very useful if you want to use the train - the station is just over the road). It wasn't noisy (unless you were in the lounge or reception) and trains appeared to cease around 11pm and didn't restart until 7 or 8am. We were upgraded immediately on arrival at no extra charge and the room was lovely. The service was great and the staff helpful and friendly. The restaurant food was delicious. My only criticism would be that the breakfast was mediocre and the waitress staff were rather miserable. On the whole I would recommend this hotel. Not the Ritz, but then again you're not paying Ritz prices!

219,Not bad for the money...,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.  Our main complaint was the distance from downtown, and we had to walk through an area that was a bit creepy for the last few blocks. (You wouldn't likely want to hang around this area or go to the pub in this hotel...it seemed kind of sad ..) Although, it was very close to Central train station, actually across the street.   The food was fine (Irish breakfast), staff nice and place clean and up to grade.   We did have to hoof up the stairs with bags to get to the reception area. Once there, a lift was available.   The price was certainly good for the mid-week dates we booked on-line.

The only reservation I could express here was the waiter, he was pleasant, however there was no real irish welcome, no chit chat at all. the show was absolutely fantastic.

219,Too risky,"OK, I needed convenience to the train and bus stations to meet up with others and transfer to next part of trip, so I was willing to compromise some, but not this much.  I had booked two short stays in advance--one via the hotel website and one via Laterooms.com, both similar rates, but one slightly better than the other for each time I wanted.  I eventually cancelled the one through the hotel but had to email as link described for cancellation did not exist (cancel fee).  The hotel website description lists amenities, including air conditioning, so I thought that would be the solution to the noise problem.

I showed up for my first night for the Laterooms Superior room reservation.  I was given one of the front facing tiny, dingy rooms.  No nonsmoking, no air conditioning, what is superior?  I complained at desk and was told full house.  Clerk said all rooms sold through booking agent are the old rooms with no air conditioning and that should be clear on the website.  Air conditioned rooms, she said, are much more expensive.

I went to the nearby Internet cafe just to check that I remembered hotel amenities correctly from their website and there it said air conditioning and if you click on any room to reserve nothing is mentioned about air or not.  Nowhere on website does it say ""some"" with air or a number with air or not or different rates.  laterooms makes no mention one way or the other.  So, back to reception and I plead my case (it was really hot in Dublin so even the locals were miserable).    When I asked about the hotel website she said she would let marketing know that it doesn't mention that many rooms do not have air conditioning.  She asked if I had used the room and I offered to pay a supplement to upgrade.  Instead she just switched me to an airconditioned room at the back of the hotel facing the train line.  With window closed and air on the noise was not too bad.

So, verify what room type you are getting directly with hotel and avoid old rooms if windows need to be opened (I heard street noise--DART was down that day so I don't know about train).  Otherwise go for whatever they call the back rooms (not superior).

Didn't eat breakfast, but smelled burning toast everyday on staircase.
Didn't try gym.

Phone didn't work correctly--first found ringer turned off, but still husband couldn't get through--automatically went to voice mail and he was getting really worried, so I asked desk to ring and their call came through, so never resolved.

219,Please do not stay here!!!!!!!!!!,"Please do not stay here. The rooms are ok, only ok, and thats if you get a good one. We were initally placed in a room with damp on the walls, right next to the railway bridge- needless to say the noise and vibrations was horrendous. We had no sleep the first night, but quite enjoyed the breakfast - though how a bowl of cornflakes comprises a ""continental"" breakfast i do not know - where was the crossiants and fresh bread? After we complained, we were moved to a new room away from the rail noise, but were treated to a building site view instead! The staff were very poor in organising this and seemed very rude, and arrogant when we asked them to actually do their job. The following morning, we looked forward to breakfast again, but were told we had not already paid for it. On enquiring at the reception, we were told we had not paid for breakfast, only a room (we booked online, and assumed breakfast would be included in the high price). They had also then charged us around ¬£16 for the two breakfasts we had the previous morning, without telling us!! We were certainly not the only people who had problems with them, as everytime we passed reception, someone else was complaining about their bill, and what they'd been charged for. The customer service at this hotel is very poor. It is not worth the risk to get a ""good"" room as even then you will have a building site noises (though these don't go on until 1am, and start again at 5am like the trains). The facilities in the room were adequate but the ""satellite"" tv, is not controllable by you, but by someone else. It is only one channel, that seemed to be changed every few mintues. All these problems really affected our holiday, and made us not want to go back to the hotel to sleep. Spend a little more and stay somewhere that will treat you with resepct and will be comfortable enough to not ruin your break.

219,Can't fault it!,"We spent 2 nights here and after our initial horror at the peeling paint on the outside of the building we were delighted with our choice of hotel. The location couldn't be better, although we were at first worried about noise from the train station - this wasn't a problem. Staff were very helpful and our Irish breakfast was a great start to the day. Bus to the airport stops right outside. Ignore the peeling paint and enjoy!

219,"Convenient, clean and courteous.","Perhaps a bit expensive for its standard (decoration a little worn), but more than compensated for by helpful, friendly and courteous staff. Very convenient for Dublin Connolly Station and, although the trains ran within a few metres of my bedrooom window, they are few and far between during the night, so my sleep was disturbed far less than some places I've experienced (for instance there were NO noises from the plumbing, air-conditioning units, early morning deliveries, night clubs, etc.). The Irish Rail car park at the rear of Connolly is convenient and is supervised 24/7. The attendant there was very helpful in arranging long-term car parking.

219,a good stay!,"As we arrived at the North Star, we wondered why it had only been classed as two star. It was clean, spacious and the staff were friendly. The rooms were of a high standard, there was a good gym facility and a wide selection for breakfast that was worth waking up for. The only downside was the train track that ran alongside the hotel, with regular 5 minutely trains that always ran to time. However, this was only a real problem in the reception area, and in the rooms it was only 'noticeable' and did not deprive us of a good nights sleep. The hotel is in a great location, near the train station and bus routes that link directly to the airport. It is also only a ten minute walk from the centre of O'Connel Street where there are plenty of resteraunts for the evenings. I would recommend this hotel, as you get an overall good service for your money.

219,Enjoyed the 2 days spent in Dublin.,"My cousin booked the North Star Hotel via the Internet January, 2005.. Bus from York to Leeds Airport. We flew from Leeds to Dublin with Ryanair.  Found booking Clerk at Leeds very officious and not welcoming. As my cousin knew the ropes we had no trouble getting on the booked flight and in 35 mins we were in Dublin. Bus transported us to the Busarus. The North Star Hotel was in walking distance from where the Bus dropped us at the Terminus.We could walk into the main streets and city sights of Dublin.  We found the location convenient for us. We booked on a half day tour to The Wicklow Mountains, Ballykissangel (Avoca) and Glendalough.  This tour left from Connolly Station. We only had to walk across the street to the Station. We enjoyed the tour and found the Tour guide and bus driver great and had a good knowledge of the area we visited.  Enjoyable. Recommend the Knightsbridge Bar at the Arlington Hotel for a free live Irish Music and Dancing. The live show performed by the Celtic Rhythm Dancers was a real Irish experience.  The meal served was OK.The room at the North Star was small but comfortable with twin beds and adequate facilities and clean.  Breakfast offered a good choice.  Staff were welcoming and courteous.  I enjoyed the City Sights Tour Bus. Loved the Irish people.",4,2005,03,31
219,for train spotters,"This Hotel is weird! The public Restaurant and the Bar are in a building fronting Amiens Street, and the reception is under the arches of the railway line. The bedrooms and breakfast room are on the other side of the track.
It is clean and comfortable and very convenient for the Airport bus, the train station and the new tram service into town. If you stay here ask for a non-smoking room on floor 3 or above on the side away from the tracks unless you love the sound and sight of trains. They run every 3 muinutes in the rush hour.
It is about 15 minutes walk to the Spire monument on O Connell Street.

219,Fantastic Value for money!!,"Having booked a really cheap Ryanair flight from Luton and a reasonable 2 night stay at the North star Hotel, I had every right to be slightly apprehensive about going to Dublin, being a 21yr old lass going away for a couple of days with my best pal.  Why did i even worry, as soon as we arrived into Dublin Airport we were advised of a bus service that dropped us right outside the North Star Hotel and it only cost us 5 Euro's for the 30 minute journey, i havent travelled on public transport for a long time however to me that was a bargain.  For future reference it was the 748 it operates every 30mins to and from Dublin Airport to the North Star, very convenient and much cheaper than a cab.

When i first arrived at the North Star I was slightly put off by the Railway noise, however you only really experience this in reception.  I knew to expect this having read awful reports on Trip Advisor from Clients who had rooms situated at the front of the hotel.  I'd like to point out that what these people don't tell you in their reports is that this Hotel has a total of 130 rooms, 30 of which are situated at the front of the Hotel the remaining 100 towards the rear, they also fail to mention that they paid an even cheaper rate than the likes of myself and other Clients whose rooms were located at the rear.  Admittedly having read these reports i emailed the hotel direct and requested a room towards the rear of the Hotel and thats exactly what i got.  At the end of the day you get what you pay for as far as i'm concerned.  

I found the rooms very clean, spacious and ideal for all.  Being an Independant Travel Advisor I've had the oppurtunity to stay in some very upmarket properties around the world, which in all fairness makes me look for fault in any hotel i visit, quite unusual for someone of my age you may think, but you do become slightly snobby when it comes to a place to stay.  However i found this Hotel ideal and ideal for all ages.

The only downfall we had with this hotel was the building site we had as a view, but to be fair we didnt even notice it was there until we opened the window and heard the work going on, the windows protected us from all the noise that the only time we got distubance was when we opened the window, which wasn't something we needed to do often with a good Air Conditioning unit we could use in our room.

The North Star is in a fab location only a few minutes walk from O'Connell Street and a 10-15 minute walk from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  Ideal for those who want to be away from all the hussle and bustle but close enough if you want it.

Overall i would say this Hotel is Clean, comfortable, extremely friendly and great value for money.

I enjoyed myself so much that i was hoping to book for New Year, unfortunately they are fully booked and so i have had to reserve a room at there sister hotel in Temple Bar.  However this wont stop me from popping in and saying hi, because all the staff are so friendly and personal, the sort you know would remember you.

I hope my review helps anyone looking to stay at the North Star, the only thing i would recommend before you go is to email reception and ask for a room located at the back end of the hotel.  Bearing in mind this isnt a very big hotel anyway, you should enjoy your stay.

219,Only if you need to be at Connolly Station early,"This hotel is in a great location for both the airport bus and Connolly Station so if you're arriving late or leaving early from the station it's a good idea. 

I stayed in one the dreaded older rooms at the front and can confirm that they are extremely pokey and don't look terribly clean and are very very noisy, in fact you almost have to hold onto the sides of the bed whenever a train goes over the bridge. As I paid very little for the room and am a heavy sleeper I didn't mind too much but I'd guess that most people would find it impossible to sleep through the noise.

Nice breakfast. Reception staff are a little customer service challenged but not rude.",2,2005,03,05
219,Not so great!,"I stayed here Jan 14 - 16, 2005.  I thought there were more positive things here on the website so I booked it.  Sorry I did.  Although the staff was very helpful, the place was not up to any standards.  Rooms were VERY Motel 6-ish.... dirty, in need of repairs, and the loud construction noise at 6am (in the back) was unbearable.  It's only a short 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar, but I would rather pay more for a nicer hotel, closer to that area next time.  I wouldn't stay here again.  Although I didn't see bugs, I worried about them at night when I turned the light out.

219,Not good,"I researched this hotel on Trip Advisor before I booked for 28th December 2004.  I thought there were more good reviews than bad so decided to book.  As said - this hotel has an old and new part.  We got a tiny room (room 107) in the old part, it was over the pub so very noisy, the tram line ran right outside and we left very early the next morning because the smell of sewage in the room was overpowering.  So here is my advice - if you are going to stay at this hotel DO NOT accept any room that is numbered under 150.  If you are put in an old room COMPLAIN and asked to be moved.  That is what Reception said we should have done when we complained the next morning.  Very convenient for Connelly Station and breakfast was OK.

219,Fab place to stay!!!!,"We stayed at The North Star Hotel last october.
Personally we found this hotel to be fantastic, The room we stayed in was spotless & i think it had just been decorated (Along with many others) The breakfast's are spot on & the restaraunt is also a nice place to eat. The only ""grumble"" i had about the place is that our room looked out on to a buliding site but hey that's development and you will find that in every major city. Fantastic place i would definitely recommend & would definitely stay there again.

219,pleasantly surprised.,"just back from this hotel and i had a great stay there, from the outside it looks like an old irish bar but it improved when you entered. the room was a double with a single bed also the room was clean ,tea and coffee well stocked ,hardly heard any noise from dart (not enough to disturb you anyway) had one of the best roast dinners ive ever had in the hotel restaurant, bar and reception staff friendly and i wanted to bring the bed home with me it was so comfy. the buffet breakfast was exellent. my only one complaint would be that i think the hotels guest lounge resembled an old folks home (just the decor and the seats,) but all in i would visit this hotel again definately and i would recommend it to anyone.

219,Don't stay here,"Awful! Don't stay here unless you like a lot of noise and rooms that are in real need of updating. Despite having pre-paid for three nights over the internet we decided to check out after only one.

You could hear conversation from the street in the first room we were given and there is currently a huge construction project next to the hotel. I didn't want to wait to find out what the noise would be like in the morning so I asked to be moved, which give them their due they did promptly. 

However, that night at approx 3am the woman in the room next door decided to demonstrate how thin the walls are by turning on the TV, falling asleep and snoring. I wasn't exactly happy to have to listen to Friday night with Johnathan Ross through the wall considering I'd watched the programme itself the night before! The woman wouldn't wake up despite our knocking on her door and the walls so I phoned reception. To be fair they did try and call her once and we heard her answer but that was it - back to snoring and Jonathan Ross. I called reception again and they muttered that they would do something about it again and I asked them to let me know but he was't exactly receptive. This time we heard no phone call and not at any point did anyone from the hotel knock on her door. Fifteen minutes later and nothing had happened and no call from reception to let us know what they were doing. Eventually after much hammering on the wall from us she woke and turned of the TV!

Noisy neighbours can by a pain anywhere but the incredibly thin walls plus their apparent lack of interest in our problem simply wasn't good enough.

On top of this the rooms were quite shabby and the bedspreads needed replacing. The whole look of the hotel was outdated and I imagine that maybe it once looked good but now it just looks a bit desperate. If this hotel was a bargain then I would maybe say that you could put up with the above but the fact is that it isn't a cheap! The place we moved to, the Town House was quite a bit cheaper, had great decoration and really friendly service!

The location was great, the food was wonderful, with so much to choose from and the Restuarant staff were brilliant.  Our stay was so nice, we're coming to Dublin again in Feb 2005 and our first choice of Hotel will be the North Star. I would recommend this Hotel to any of my family & friends who are visiting Dublin.

219,Don't arrive late on Saturday night!,"Arrived late on Saturday night and found room double booked, even after calling to advise of late arrival.  We were moved to the Regency hotel near the airport for the night (which was an awful hotel) but after a lot of complaining we were able to get back into the North Star for the rest of our stay.  We were given a complimentary meal (again, after much complaining) which was worse than actually being moved in the first place!  I wouldn't recommend eating in the restaurant.  The manager told us he'd put us in one of the ""nice"" rooms (once we eventually got checked in) which was nice but nothing special, just what you would expect from a hotel room really.  The gym was ok, but no music or water!  Male sauna wasn't working.  Apart from the carry on of being overbooked, the hotel itself was ok, but got the impression that they always overbook the rooms on a weekend.  Would probably stay here again but only if I wasn't arriving on a late flight.

219,Right next to the train station,"stayed here in June 04, hotel was pleasant, although a little walk from the centre of Dublin. Rooms were ok, but did expect a little more from them.  However, staying at the front of the hotel opposite the train station on a main road, the noise was really bad, the rooms were warm, but you couldnt open a window, because of the noise. And, when the trains start in the morning about 5.30am, expect your headboard to start vibrating!!

219,Don't be put off by the exterior!,"We booked the North Star hotel on a 3 for 2 nights offer.  I had read other reviews of this hotel and dreaded going, as apparently part of this hotel is a 3 start and the other is a 2 star.  It does have a railway track running through the hotel, but i didn't really notice the trains at all.

We booked a double non-smoking room, but when when checked in, we were informed that there were no non-smoking rooms left.  The room we had did smell a little of smoke, but when you turn on the airconditioner, the smell soon goes.  

The room did look slightly dated, but still up to my standards (and i am VERY fussy!).  The size of the room was quite big, and there was a single bed in there, as well as a double.  The bathroom was clean, the bed was comfortable and the full Irish breakfast that was included was belly-bustingly good.  It did have a gym, which looked like it had all the modern equipment.

The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring Dublin and beyond, and the bus service is very reliable.

I highly recommend visiting the Jameson Distillery (and when he asks for a volunteer, raise your hand quickly, as you get to have 6 shots of different whiskies to taste test).  I also recommend the Guinness tour, as the view from the top bar is breathtaking.

219,Really pleasant hotel!,"Went to Dublin last year and stayed in Temple Bar which was really good. This year we had difficulty getting booked the time we wanted as it was the big football final. We eventually got booked with North Star, which sounded nice but area sounded dodgy after reading some things on trip advisor. I can honestly say i thoroughly enjoyed my time there and didnt feel threatned walking at night in that area, it did look a bit seedy but we had no probs.
Dublin is a fantastic place with very pleasant people, thats the hotel staff, pub staff, tour bus lady-Kay,shop workers, everyone! Breakfasts in hotel were yummy, black pudding especially.
Ate at Thai Orchid and Italian Connection, both lovely restaurants.
Got fab bargains in Dunnes Stores (theres about 6 of them) and Penneys! Would definitely do back again. Only took 40 mins on flight too, marvellous!! Ryan air steward was a bit of a prat tho, but thats the only bad point.",4,2004,09,28
219,beware of the cheap seats,"I stayed at the North Star Aug 04 on a 3 day city break, and was led to believe by the travel agent that we were going to a superior 3 star hotel, the photo of the bedrooms was lovely unfortunately what we were put in was nothing like what was in the brochure, yes there are these lovely rooms available, but not for the likes of us on a package deal, YES thats what the receptionist told us when we complained and may i add several more complaints were made by other residents whilst we were there.The room was small, shabby, bed had a huge dip in the middle and the noise was unberable from the busy main st outside which constantly had a stream of traffic night and day, If the dirty window had not have been broken at the latch then we may have been able to shut it properly and get some slight relief form the noise. The hotel has been extended and if you are lucky enough to get a room in the new part then you should find nothing to complain about as the rooms are lovely and all doubleglazed, not like the hell hole we were in. Breakfast room immaculate, food good, but watch out for the girl who toasts the bread as she never wore gloves and kept touching her face and hair constantly. Location of this hotel is in a rough area of the city and several locals came up to us on numerous occasions warning us to watch out for pick pockets and not to venture too far in the area at night. Needless to say we wont be staying at the North Star again.

We particularly fell in love with the concierge who is an absolute gem and couldn't help us enough with places to see and eat and drink etc. He booked us places on a tour of the Dublin Mountains which picked us up from the hotel and was a fantastic day.

On our last night there I cut my finger very bad and was bleeding profusely. The receptionist was very helpful indeed and, despite the limited first aid kit available, did her best to deal with a woman dripping blood all over her reception floor!!

There was construction going on right outside my window so unless you want to check out the construction guy the view was non-existent.  The noise from the construction wasn't a problem for me.  If you plan on sleeping in late it might be.  The location wasn't bad.  Short walk to O'Connell St and all the sites.  I went in May, which is considered their off season and the North Star was the most expensive hotel I stayed in.  Although the cheapest I could find on the net.  I would recommend booking for a couple of days and then finding a place when you get there.  Dublin is FULL of places to stay and their Visitor Centers are extremely helpful.

219,Good value hotel,"The North Star has changed for the better since I 1st stayed in it several years ago. Do not let the outside put you off as it is a good value, centrally located, pleasant hotel. Rates vary on the Internet from 60 euro to 120 euro per room inc breakfast ( which is excellent food), they do have a car park for a 5 euro  overnight fee, both the restaurant and bar offer good value for money. The rooms are a good size and well maintained. Many locals drink in the bar and unusually for Dublin most of the bar staff are local so they can give excellent advise on places to visit and see. It is a 10 - 15 min walk to Templebar which to be honest is only visited by Tourists, most Irish avoid Templebar because it is overpriced and over rated. 1 small gripe about the North Star is the noise of the passing DART ( Train )",4,2004,05,20
219,okay but not brilliant,"Bit disappointed with hotel in relation to price. we have stayed in cheaper and better elsewhere. 
It was a good 20 mins walk to Temple Bar area and we had warnings from locals not to walk back to hotel but to get cab as it is bad area. Didn't seem so bad though (same as London really).
You can hear the trains from the room but not really at night (few bevvies probably sorted that out). Some strange intermittent buzzing in room but other rooms seemed ok. Some areas of hotel was bit tatty in decor but rooms were ok.
Room was a good size, we had a double and single bed, clean and tidy; TV, tea and coffee, hairdryer.  Had room overlooking building site but was not noisy over weekend.
Buffet breakfast was ok. Avoid the black and white pudding as they can be used as ice hockey pucks. Reception staff friendly, breakfast staff a bit grumpy,  sweet and helpful concierge guy. Couldn't tell if room service had been. They only seem to leave new towels.
Oh and... some previous visitor left half bottle of coke and family pack of doritos in drawers...thanx for that !! Doritos came in handy when we got beer munchies !!!! have left few packets for next visitor !",3,2004,05,12
219,Avoid: Get a better deal elsewhere,I stayed here in May 2004 and I was disappointed--especially for the price--99 euros. The rooms are tired and worn out and lack charm and it is not conveniently located. It's close to the bus station but that just makes it seedier.

 And to Veronica for her help and management of a problem we have had outside the hotel.
Hugely grateful!",4,2024,08,28
219,Excellent,"Magnificent personal experience, the hotel is very nice and equipped, the thing that pleased me the most is the staff, especially ISABEL, it was the absolute best.
I was very happy with my week's holiday here in Dublin, thanks Connoly hotel.",5,2024,08,17
219,Either excellent or unacceptable,"For me, this hotel is a hotel of extremes, either things are quite excellent or simply unacceptable. Our stay moves me to provide a detailed analysis and review. As a professor who has taught service management, quality management and tourism business administration for decades, I also feel called to do so.

At first, we were traveling as a group of friends. Two of my friends occupied a triple room with two children each. I myself had booked a much more expensive club room.

Representation of the hotel: Already on the first page at Booking.com (I had booked there) is advertised with a photo of the pool or spa area. However, when you learn that the spa is only accessible for a fairly high daily entrance fee per person, you are disappointed. Maybe that's somewhere in the text, but I don't remember reading that.

The location of the hotel is ambivalent. On the one hand you only need a less than ten minute walk to get to O‚ÄôConnell Street and Spire, on the other hand you already have a certain queasy feeling in the evening due to the muddy surroundings. A train line runs through the middle of the hotel itself, the reception is under the tracks in a vault, my room was immediately adjacent to the tracks. My window was not openable but also not better to close and absolutely not soundproofed. As a railway fan, none of this would have bothered me so much, only unfortunately the stay started with construction work taking place on the tracks right outside my window after closing time in the middle of the night and I was directly exposed to this construction noise. The hotel should have known this. Fortunately, the construction work on the track only took place on the first night. However, the joy of this was clouded by the fact that from the second day onwards construction works took place in the evening on the road behind the tracks.

The room was, you really have to say, basically very well equipped. It was very large, all controls were ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, including the TV, the curtain opened and closed at the touch of a button, there were enough storage areas, the lighting was excellent, there were enough sockets, all this really great and excellent. Instead of tap water, which does not taste good in Dublin, one could have expected fresh mineral water daily at this price. I particularly liked the fact that there was a button that could turn off the entire lighting and there were also night lights on the ground that could be triggered by a motion detector. 

The very best thing about the whole room was the bed. I rarely slept in such a comfortable bed. 

Unfortunately, there is also a massive criticism here, namely the bathroom. This would be big enough in itself but in the bathtub (there is no shower cubicle) there was only a rain shower, moreover with low water pressure, there was no hand shower! This is intolerable for a four-star hotel, so intimate hygiene becomes a matter of acrobatics or you need various tools. This is neither convenient nor comfortable and absolutely not appropriate for such accommodation. The toilet also made a very filigree impression, so as an overweight person I was afraid to crash the thing on the floor when I sat on it.

The breakfast we used on the first day and this one I can rate as very good. There is a wide range of food and also the price is reasonable. Just across the street is a Starbucks.

The staff was on average reasonably friendly, some staff were very accommodating, others quite rough, but overall the friendliness was fine. I found interesting that we were not asked for our satisfaction on departure. I notice that such a request ‚Äì of course it is often meant only rhetorically and not seriously ‚Äì is increasingly absent, which allows only two conclusions: either you are not interested in how the guest liked it anyway or you already know what he would answer and spare yourself the discussion.

In view of the points raised for me too high price, in my room EUR 1,318,-- without breakfast for five nights, the two triple rooms with less comfort were each EUR 1,208,-- more acceptable, I will not choose this hotel anymore, unless the bathrooms are equipped with a hand shower, which would be a very simple and technically easily solved thing.",3,2024,08,16
219,Recommended,"2 days before arrival I informed that we will arrive already at 10:00 in the morning. Check-in is usually from 15:00. We could immediately move into our room at our arrival! SUPER SERVIVE - thank you.
Room clean, staff very friendly and helpful. Cooles Hotel. Very good food in the associated restaurant. We will be back.",5,2024,08,01
219,Nice hotel and excellent service,"We loved the place travel with family in June amazing place good location very good design and above all the cleanliness of the place.
highlighting the attention of Mr. Ruben gave us many tips on how to know the place and where to have fun in dublin 
100% recommended.",5,2024,07,01
219,Samuel our young serviceman.,Samuel gave us an excellent service by receiving us and getting us to our room. The location. From the hotel.very central. The menu available very good with affordable prices. I recommend it for your next visit and would stay here again.,5,2024,06,26
219,Good location,"I stayed at this hotel only one night before leaving for a tour of the country. Modern and spacious rooms, the bathroom a little less (at least where I stayed), good and varied breakfast although for self service drinks there is only one machine, which lengthens the line a lot. At the corner of the hotel supermarket stocked with everything and in the surroundings many pubs for dinner",4,2024,06,24
219,central hotel within walking distance of downtown,"I stayed only one night at room n.555 excellent, spacious, well furnished soft bed, varied breakfast, to recommend near the center and nearby there are two supermarkets, pizzeria and restaurants, very kind staff as indeed throughout Ireland.",4,2024,06,23
219,Pleasant stay,"It was a very pleasant stay, the location was very good, the rooms were comfortable and especially what we liked most was the treatment of the workers like Rub√©n who was attentive and helpful to us :) We will repeat!",5,2024,06,19
219,Wonderful stay at El Address. Exceptional Customer Service,"We just got back from Dublin. We were traveling through Dublin and saw the Guinness and the Epic. The hotel is located very close to the Center next to the train and the bus and tram station. The reception is super exclusive with the brick ceiling where the train passes, in our room we did not hear the train, the Spanish lady Isabel made sure we were on the top floor, ninth floor, impressive views. recommendable",5,2024,06,17
219,Holidays in Dublin ,"We are 6 Spanish girls and we want to make it clear that the reception staff, specifically Isabel, Rub√©n and Samuel, also from Cordoba, are top 10 professionals and the hotel is very well decorated, the beds are very comfortable, many thanks to the staff.
PS: they should soundproof some rooms better ",5,2024,06,12
219,Excellent treatment,We liked it very much. We received exceptional treatment from the team. Many thanks to Rub√©n for all his kindness and excellent treatment. With people like Rub√©n it's a pleasure. Congratulations. We will definitely return to The Address very soon,5,2024,06,04
219,Very central and very attentive staff,"Highly recommended, the staff very friendly and decisive. Very clean rooms. The breakfast was very varied. Highlight Rub√©n, very attentive and helpful, making the stay more pleasant. My next stay in Dublin will be at this hotel and I will definitely recommend it.",5,2024,06,04
219,Busy railway line right next to the hotel window,"We stayed at The Adress as a couple for 2 days. The reception was very friendly and we were warmly welcomed by the reception staff. Check-in went smoothly.
When we got to our room, we were impressed for the first moment: very luxurious and stylishly furnished. We were a little surprised by the drawn, opaque curtain. When we opened it, we saw the reason: there were train tracks right next to the room, which unfortunately were used quite often - even at night. Sometimes the train even stood right in front of our window for minutes at night with its engines running, which kept us awake. The price charged for the room here would certainly be justified for the room, but not under these circumstances. All the luxury is made null and void in one fell swoop.
In addition, the rooms themselves are very thinly soundproof. Last night, the couple who lived in the next room came back at around 3 a.m., first slamming doors, then arguing in the room (not screaming), including a noisy reconciliation afterwards ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è They deserve it, it wouldn't have been an issue if the walls weren't so thin. The night before, we also had to endure the snoring from the next room.

We were a little disappointed at breakfast: it was described as a continental breakfast, but unfortunately it didn't go beyond butter, ham, 2 jams and butter. But at least there was that.

Conclusion: staff great, very friendly and helpful. Room: stylish, large and very clean, but extremely thin, and the train runs directly past the room

We would check in here again without the train, but unfortunately The Address didn't convince us.

If you're not sensitive to noise and don't mind the train and the unpleasant view, you'll definitely find a great place to stay here and have a great time",3,2024,06,01
219,Very good instructions at the hotel reception,"I recommend the breakfast buffet 100%, it is worth it, and I also recommend asking at reception for advice on places to visit in Dublin, Miss Isabel helped us, and the truth is that we loved the places she recommended we see and eat, we are very grateful, I also recommend the hotel because it is very well located and the rooms are very spacious and comfortable, we will stay again in the future",5,2024,05,25
219,Stay in Dublin,"We spent a few days in Dublin and stayed at this hotel due to the opinions of other users of this page
The spacious room and the delicious food.
Everything was great and I would highlight Ruben who was very kind and friendly.
If we return to Dublin we will stay at this hotel again",5,2024,05,17
219,Isabel,"My score is due to the excellent treatment received by Miss Isabel, at reception, who demonstrated extraordinary professionalism and closeness. People like this turn a normal stay into a memorable one.

As for the hotel, everything is correct.

Thank you so much.",5,2024,04,29
219,"Central hotel, great staff.","Central hotel, opposite Connolly Station, very close to the Epic Museum. They treated us exquisitely at the hotel. Good rooms, very good breakfast and dinner included for my exceptional group. Also, while all the staff were great, a special thanks to Daniel and Isabel. They are fantastic. I would definitely recommend the hotel for Spaniards.",5,2024,04,01
219,The best thing about the Hotel by far is the special attention that Belen and Isabel give you,"Good hotel, relatively close to the center (10 minutes walk to O'Connell Street), full breakfast, quite modern, very interesting pubs nearby, train station right in front. Very clean. A lot of noise from trains in the rooms that face the tracks. And the bathroom air extractor is also working all the time.",4,2024,03,27
219,Wonderful experience,"Very professional, kind and welcoming staff, it was my birthday and they surprised me by giving me a plate with happy birthday written on it.
Clean rooms, comfortable bed and pleasant bathroom shower.
A special praise to Mrs. Isabel, simply ‚ÄúMaravillosa‚Äù.",5,2024,03,24
219,100% recommendable hotel,"Magnificent Hotel! Thank Isabel and her colleagues for how well they have treated us. 100% recommended for its cleanliness, comfort and location. Unbeatable quality-price ratio. 5 minutes from O'Connell Street and a little more from Temple Bar. We will be back!",5,2024,01,29
219,A top notch hotel,"A delightful hotel, which lacks nothing.
Very friendly and helpful staff, and if you take advantage of the breakfast you won't be disappointed.
5 delightful days that found the perfect culmination in the relaxation of the spa!!
Ps: they have a fabulous salt sauna!!!",5,2024,01,06
219,Horror in Dublin,"Staff unfriendly, it feels like a freight train is driving through the room (every 3 minutes from 8am) and cleaning staff are shouting in the hallways from 8am! Mind this hotel!!! Far too expensive and even as a guest there is no food available after 9am!",1,2024,01,02
219,Service poor,"We booked four nights in a club room. Unfortunately, the pictures do not correspond to reality. Our room had a small window from which you could see the next wall. No daylight. The room was not cleaned all day on the first day, even though we were not there. When we returned at 5 p.m., we first had to go to reception and ask if the decoration could be cleaned. On the second day, we proactively went to reception in the morning and asked them to please clean the room. That worked. We did this again on the third day, but when we returned in the afternoon, the room was still not cleaned. This should not have happened. 

The pool in the spa also has a lot of chlorine and the spa is generally very small and not very clean. You can also skip the club lounge. There were also dead flies lying around everywhere in the morning. 

Conclusion: not recommended",2,2024,01,01
219,Very good,"We were there for work and it was an excellent experience!!! If you go, I recommend that Isabel assist you. SHE IS CHARMING!
Close to everything and with a good combination when moving around and when visiting everything.",5,2023,12,23
219,I would recommend it!,"Not exactly a cheap hotel but these are Dublin prices. Beautiful rooms, super friendly staff who were attentive to every request, abundant breakfast, excellent cleanliness. The only flaw... the area... it's true that it's a stone's throw from the centre, temple bar can be easily reached on foot, but let's say that the area is frequented by unsavory people, a problem that logically only arises at night. However, a hotel that I would choose again and recommend!",4,2023,10,26
219,5 star hotel,"Well located hotel a short walk from the center of Dublin. Delighted with the hotel facilities and the staff, all very friendly. Especially thank you for the attention that Isabel has had with us, thank you very much!!!",5,2023,10,04
219,Very good,"Excellent hotel, spacious and clean rooms, good breakfast, we had a good time, quite central so you can get around the city on foot, no need to take the bus or taxi. It is a modern hotel with gym and sauna. It is located near Connelly station and the Luas tram line.",4,2023,09,12
219,A good experience,"Correct and well located hotel.
Some practices, such as charging for the entire stay upon arrival, and having to pay in advance for the services used, for example, breakfast, detract from the overall assessment of the experience.
However, the staff is excellent. We particularly want to mention Isabel who made our stay very pleasant. Isabel is charming, very professional and always efficient.",4,2023,09,10
219,Excellent value for money,"Hotel about 10, 15 minutes walk from Temple Bar in the station area, in the evening around 11 there are always a few people on the street, but I can't say later. Large rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows with French doors onto a tiny balcony. Comfortable bathroom with bathtub but with handle to facilitate entry and exit. Complete breakfast from sweet to savory, with eggs, bacon etc. The only flaw was on Sunday evening when the door handle literally remained in our hands and the reception told us that the employee would be there on Monday morning. In the reception when the trains pass you can hear the noise as if they were above you but not in the room. We were on the fifth floor.",4,2023,09,07
219,Highly recommended,"Beautiful and cozy hotel with many services and modern facilities. Very good location, close to the center and well connected. Attentive and friendly staff. We also had a great rest because the beds are very comfortable!",5,2023,08,31
219,poor rooms,"the staff is very kind and helpful which is why I gave it 3 stars.. but the room would be 1/2.
Very poor cleaning, luckily I always travel with the necessary cleaning and sanitizing supplies, I had to go through the toilet, sink and tub again. The first evening we had to change rooms because the smell from the kitchens was unbearable.",3,2023,08,27
219,The hotel 5 points and the workers 10 points,"I stayed the first week of August and the truth is that it has been a great experience, not only because of the hotel, which is phenomenal, especially because of the staff who work there. Both in the restaurant, the bar, reception, cleaning, etc., all top people.
I would like to make a special mention of Isabel, who from the beginning not only did her job, she went much further, giving advice on what to see, how to get around, etc.
As I said, a 10 out of 10 experience.",5,2023,08,26
219,Pleasant surprise,"Pleasant surprise! Very kind staff, super comfortable, large room, bathroom with shower and bathtub, courtesy slippers, bathrobes, coffee machine in the room.... Everything new and clean, a really nice treat for our last night in Ireland. Convenient location, close to the center. It is 30 minutes by taxi from the airport (cost around 32 euros).",5,2023,08,18
219,A highly recommended hotel in Dublin,"The hotel is very good. We booked Club category rooms, which gave us access to some extras, such as a cheese, cold cuts and wine tasting in a restricted room, with a terrace. Felipe, the Brazilian waiter, was very attentive to everything and was very friendly and professional.",5,2023,08,16

219,"Hotel gut, aber Parksituation ist sehr schlecht.","Das Hotel hat leider keine Parkpl√§tze und die Angestellten kennen nicht einmal die Parkplatzempfehlungen auf deren Internetseite. Als wir ankamen hatte es 3 Mitarbeiter am Check-in. Wir hatten ja alles im Voraus gebucht und mussten ca. 40 min. warten, bis die Dame alles eingegeben hatte. Das Hotel und der Service ansonsten war ausgezeichnet, aber die Parksituation und Check-in, hat noch Potenzial. 1 Tag Parkhaus 40‚Ç¨.

219,Hotel molto carino peccato per il personale della reception,"Holtel carino, abbastanza vicino al centro. La mia stanza era grande e confortevole anche se, forse causa covid, praticamente priva di qualsiasi dotazione extra. L'aspetto negativo √® la gestione da parte del personale della reception: completamente inefficiente e a volte perfino maleducato. La prima mattina chiedo se possibile cambiare stanza, in quanto la mia era a fianco all'ascensore e ho passato la notte a sentire le urla degli ospiti che rientravano, un ragazzo giovane della reception mi dice che mi avrebbero spostata nel pomeriggio e di chiudere le valigie. Rientro nel tardo pomeriggio, chiedo per la nuova stanza e nessuno sapeva nulla.. tra l'altro vengo trattata con estrema maleducazione da una giovane signora alta e mora alla reception ( era sabato 25 ottobre pomeriggio ma non ricordo il nome), mi risponde male sbuffando che cos√¨ poca professionalit√† e sgarbatezza ancora non l'avevo mai vista. Il giorno dopo chiedo sempre allo stesso ragazzo della reception se la mia camera poteva essere pulita, causa covid bisogna richiederlo, torno il pomeriggio e si erano dimenticati (cio√® il ragazzo si era dimenticato di avvisare). Perfortuna √® arrivato un signore (penso indiano), probabilmente il concierge, gentilissimo e professionale che ha provevduto a sistemare un pochino e a portare asciugamani puliti.. √® stata l'unica persona gentile della struttura e che sapeva fare bene il suo lavoro. Nonostante tutti questi problemi l'hotel non ha fatto nulla per scusarsi ma dalle recensioni lette vedo che molti ospiti hanno riscontrato il mio stesso problema con il personale del ricevimento. Peccato perch√® √® veramente una struttura carina ma con quello che costa anche il servizio √® importante. Inotre lasciavano girare tutti gli ospiti tranquillamente senza mascherina nelle aree comuni..",3,2021,09,29
219,Week end a dublino,"Week end super veloce a Dublino. L'albergo √® molto carino con la possibilit√† di fare anche check in molto tardi. La mia camera, un tripla standard, e confortevole e abbastanza spaziosa. Unica grande pecca √® che un 4stelle non pu√≤ avere il frigobar completamente vuoto, arrivando in albergo molto tardi non abbiamo avuto possibilit√† di  avere neanche una bottiglia d'acqua. Colazione irish breakfast nella media anche dei costi esterni all'albergo piuttosto alti. La zona abbastanza comoda per raggiungere il centro, circa 20 minuti a piedi, √® un po degradata ma comunque molto vivace. Nei pressi pub interessanti per la cena. Al ritorno ho chiesto di prenotare il taxi per l'aeroporto ma purtroppo la reception non ha controllato che la prenotazione non era stata presa in carico... peccato a volte ci vuole molto poco per infastidire gli ospiti. ",3,2021,09,26
219,BUON HOTEL CON SERVIZIO RECEPTION DA MIGLIORARE,"hotel bello, buona posizione, colazione ok ma ristorante davvero non male, peccato per la reception: personale per niente organizzato e in alcuni casi poco d'aiuto. 
alla mattina ho prenotato a una ragazza in reception la sauna per la sera e un tavolo al ristorante: arrivata l'ora stabilita, la sauna era totalmente spenta e non pronta, cos√¨ ho avuto il dubbio che anche il tavolo al ristorante non fosse stato prenotato. chiamo in reception per confermare e la ragazza mi dice che avrebbe controllato e poi richiamato. aspetto +40 minuti e nessuno richiama. a quel punto chiamo nuovamente e un'altra ragazza dice che deve controllare (di nuovo?) ma almeno mi fa attendere in linea.
il problema √® anche che ogni giorno, ogni tot ore, le ragazze in reception cambiano e quindi non si sa mai con chi si √® parlato e molto probabilmente c'√® poca comunicazione tra il personale stesso.
per un hotel 4 stelle questo tipo di servizio √® abbastanza inaccettabile.",3,2021,09,04
219,Ottima posizione e bellissimo soggiorno,"Il posto √® bellissimo, veramente particolare e arredato al minimo dettaglio. 
Alla reception troverete sempre qualcuno di veramente disponibile pronto ad aiutarvi ad ogni ora.
Le stanze sono molto belle e moderne, non grandissime ma davvero confortevoli.
La pulizia √® fatta regolatamente e in maniera impeccabile, bagni compresi (dove tra l‚Äôaltro, nonostante non ci sia una finestra, l‚Äôaria si cambia facilmente)
nella nostra stanza c‚Äôera a disposizione un frigo, un phone, shampoo e bagnoschiuma, asciugamani (cambiati ogni giorno) e il necessario per prepararsi un the o un caffe.
I letti erano veramente comodi e puliti.
Per quanto riguarda il resto dell‚Äôhotel, √® possibile fare colazione, pranzare/cenare e prendersi qualcosa da bere nel lounge bar.
Unica pecca, gli orari.
Personalmente non abbiamo mai usufruito n√© del pranzo n√© della cena, poich√© eravamo sempre fuori. Se vi servir√† avere un tavolo, assicuratevi di comunicarlo alla reception con anticipo, √® un luogo abbastanza frequentato.
Per quanto riguarda il lounge bar, purtroppo chiude abbastanza presto (intorno alle 23), ma troverete questi orari un po‚Äô per tutta Dublino.
La colazione √® un po‚Äô costosa, a parer mio, sono 11‚Ç¨ a testa per giorno.
Infine, per quanto riguarda la posizione, penso sia il massimo della comodit√†: a meno di 10 minuti a piedi arriverete a O‚ÄôConnell Street, percorrendo una strada tutta dritta, mentre attraversando la strada, proprio di fronte all‚Äôalbergo, c‚Äô√® la stazione.
Super consigliato.",4,2021,08,25
219,Buen establecimiento en un lugar inesperado,"Nos encontramos como en casa, habitaciones amplias y limpias.

Inmediatamente nos cambiaron de habitaci√≥n y la cosa mejor√≥ considerablemente ya que nos alojaron en el edificio nuevo q es mucho m√°s moderno, Alvaro nos ayud√≥ y estuvo al pendiente de nosotros, hay varios empleados que hablan espa√±ol y la verdad q la estancia fue bastante agradable, y nos gust√≥ mucho la ciudad, desde el aeropuerto llegas a O‚Äô conell street q est√° a 10 min andando del hotel",4,2020,03,03

219,3 notti a Dublino,"Buon hotel in ottima posizione.
Molto belli gli spazi comuni, soprattutto il bar dell‚Äôhotel ideale per un t√® pomeridiano e carino anche il pub.
Camera leggermente al di sotto delle mie aspettative.
Soggiornerei ancora presso questo hotel!",4,2019,10,12
219,"Viejo, sucio y decepcionante","Este pasado fin de semana, he visitado Dublin con 2 amigos. 

La ciudad es una maravilla. Much√≠simo ambiente y conciertos en directo en todos los bares y pubs. 

El casco antiguo es precioso.

Eso si, si vais a mirar alojamiento, no se os ocurra ir a North Star.

Para empezar, el hotel se encuentra dividido en 2 edificios por entre los cuales pasa literalmente rozando las v√≠as del tren. Seg√∫n entramos en recepci√≥n y comenzamos nuestro check-in, todo empez√≥ a temblar y se escucho un fuerte ruido de chirrido. Para nuestro asombro, la compa√±era de recepci√≥n nos comenta que el tren pasa por el medio del hotel y que esto le da mucho glamour y encanto. MUCHO GLAMOUR!!! No sal√≠a de mi asombro. 

El hotel esta mas o menos cerca del centro y bien comunicado pero la zona deja mucho que desear ya que al encontrarse cerca de una estaci√≥n hay mucho vagabundo y la zona se ve en claro declive. Sino fu√©ramos 3 chicos, no hubiera pasado por all√≠ tranquilo.

Al entrar todo parece moderno. Hasta que te dicen que te toca alojarte en el edificio principal que data de hace 100 a√±os y alegando que el Ayuntamiento no les permite remodelarlo, cosa que dudo, te enchufan un edificio sin ascensor con mala accesibilidad, viejo y con todas sus instalaciones sucias y anticuadas. 

Cuando encima llegas a la habitaci√≥n y ves que esta dividida en dos y es peque√±a, te enfadas, pero lo que te deja sin palabras es que seg√∫n te asomas a la ventana las v√≠as del tren est√°n a escasos 1,5 mts de tu ventana y que el tren pasa cada 15 min en todas direcciones.

La habitaci√≥n esta medio inclinada y con desniveles importantes en el suelo. La moqueta y el papel de la pared huelen a viejo y a suciedad.

Lo √∫nico que se salva de este desastre es la cama y las almohadas. 

Lo mejor de todo es que te preguntan si necesitas ayuda con las maletas!!! Lo que necesito es un hotel en condiciones!!!

Las ventanas eran viejas y no insonorizaban. 

Contratamos la habitaci√≥n a trav√©s de booking.com

Encargamos una habitaci√≥n triple que sobre las fotos de la aplicaci√≥n pinta de lujo. TODO MENTIRA!

Las fotos de la habitaci√≥n que mostraba Booking.com en nada se parec√≠an a las originales.  

Acepte la habitaci√≥n porque solo √≠bamos a pasar 2 noches, llegamos a las 20:00 de la noche y todo el tiempo √≠bamos a pasarlo visitando la ciudad, pero era de verg√ºenza. 

Si que me gustar√≠a destacar que al menos la recepcionista fue muy amable y nos facilito un cargador ya que nos hab√≠amos olvidado de los transformadores para los enchufes brit√°nicos. ",1,2019,09,23
219,Ideale per visitare Dublino,"A due passi dalle fermate degli autobus e della Luas, in posizione strategica per raggiungere il centro e le migliori attrazioni di Dublino in meno di 15 minuti. Camere ampie, pulite, ipertecnologiche, con un letto comodissimo ed ogni tipo di comfort, come macchina del caff√®, frigobar, asse da stiro e ferro da stiro, accappatoi. Ottima insonorizzazione, aria condizionata e servizi disponibili tramite lo schermo tv. √à di grandissima utilit√† Lounge club al settimo piano, aperto 24 su 24, in self service, con caff√®, tea, acqua e biscotti disponibili sempre e croissant, pane,marmellate,yogurt e succhi sin dalla mattina presto. Personale cortese e preparato. Quando torneremo a Dublino soggiorneremo senz‚Äôaltro in questo hotel. Consigliatissimo!!!!",5,2019,09,21
219,Visitare Dublino √® facile e comodo da questo hotel,"Hotel a poco meno di 300 metri dal centro citt√†, a due passi dalla fermata del bus 747 (che porta in centro dall'aeroporto) e dalle fermate degli altri bus e della Luas, nonch√© da Talbot Street, con i suoi pub storici, e che, percorrendola porta in centro. Le camere - almeno quelle The Adress 1- sono fantastiche, l'accesso gratuito al Lounge club al 7 piano - 24 ore su 24 - √® di un'utilita' unica. Personale cortese e preparato. Servizio eccellente.",5,2019,09,21
219,Totalmente recomendable,"Estuvimos 6 d√≠as en el hotel. Muy agradable cualquiera de las personas que trabajaban all√≠ (como en todo Dubl√≠n). La habitaci√≥n genial: la cama muy c√≥moda, buen lavabo y muy limpio todo. Adem√°s, muy buen desayuno. Totalmente recomendable. ",5,2019,09,20
219,Muy recomendable,"Me he hospedado 3 semanas en el hote, y me han tratado muy bien, desde los botones, gente de front desk, el lounge y del restaurant del desayuno (Cellar). Particual y personalmente quisiera destacar y agradecer a Zharmaine y Nancy del restaurant, a Stephen (botones) e Isabel de front desk, pero todos me han atendido muy bien y me he sentido a gusto, hasta de housekeeping me reconocian despues de varios dias.
Volveria a hospedarme sin dudas",4,2019,09,18
219,La habitaci√≥n es lo m√°s destacado,"El hotel se encuentra en el norte de Dubl√≠n. Si bien est√° cerca de O'Connell St. y Henry St. (arterias comerciales y gastron√≥micas), la zona no es particularmente amigable y por la noche parece insegura. Adem√°s las principales atracciones de la ciudad est√°n en el sur, cruzando el r√≠o. Aunque se llega pronto a pie, no es lo mismo.
La habitaci√≥n era amplia, con todas las comodidades y detalles modernos, como los paneles para controlar desde las luces hasta las cortinas. Sin embargo, no hab√≠a minibar y no se pod√≠an hacer llamadas telef√≥nicas al exterior del hotel. Un atraso innecesario.
El desayuno continental, bastante b√°sico, se serv√≠a en un sal√≥n muy chico del 7¬∞ piso con terraza. No apto para hora pico.
El servicio al cuarto tiene un men√∫ muy limitado y no es nada especial.
Por √∫ltimo, la atenci√≥n del personal de recepci√≥n es displicente, cuando no antip√°tica. ",3,2019,09,11
219,Bien situado,"La recepcion nos tiro para atras de bonita que es, el hotel esta bien, tiene dos partes una en un edificio antiguo con suelos de madera, pasillos estrechos, que tiene un encanto especial, las habitaciones son iguales en ambos lados.
En el lado antiguo pasa el tren pegado pero no molesta, lo peor es que te tienes que subir las escaleras por un pasillo estrecho, en la parte nueva hay ascensor.
El desayuno esta bien como casi todos los que estuvimos y la recepcionista que habla espa√±ol es un encanto, asi com uno de los porteros que nos ayudo muchisimo (el mas delgado), lo que menos nos gusto la segunda vez es que nos dieran una habitaci√≥n con tres camas y cisterna rota diciendonos que estaban llenos (hicimos reserva con varios meses).
recomendable",4,2019,09,07
219,alles tipp topp,Es war ein sehr sch√∂ner Aufenthalt. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. In 5 Minuten war man mitten im Geschehen. Optimale Anbindungen von und zu AirLink (Bus von und zum Flughafen). Gerne wieder :),5,2019,09,04
219,Excelente,"Fue una gran experiencia. Es un gran hotel, muy bien situado (a un paso del centro de Dublin y de la estaci√≥n de bus, enfrente tiene parada de taxis y estaci√≥n de Connolly); muy buenas y modernas habitaciones; excelente atenci√≥n de su personal; buenos desayunos....Desde luego, volveremos a Dublin. Tengo claro que nuestro hotel de referencia en la capital de la Rep√∫blica de Irlanda es y ser√° North Star Hotel. Menci√≥n especial merece el personal que atend√≠a en el desayuno, siempre atentos a que no nos faltase nada. En particular, muchas gracias a Zharmaine. Volveremos !!!!",5,2019,09,02
219,C√©ntrico y moderno,"Hotel limpio, bastante c√©ntrico y buena presencia. Tuvimos que rebatirles insistentes pues no era la clase de habitaci√≥n que se reserv√≥. La cena de nochevieja ya pactada pudo ser mejorable su calidad por lo que se pag√≥.",4,2019,09,01

Presente anche un piccolo beer garden con area fumatori dove √® possibile sorseggiare una birra. La posizione √® molto centrale : gran caos, in zona ci sono pub ad ogni angolo che fanno musica dal vivo. Arrivati ad una certa ora nella notte, non d√† l'impressione di molta sicurezza.
La caratteristica di questo hotel √® che √® 'sotto' la ferrovia, per cui ci sono alcune camere vicino ai binari che √® come essere in cuccetta.",4,2019,08,31
219,Ottimo sia l'hotel che il ristorante,Struttura di ottimo livello. Prezzo adeguato al servizio offerto. Il ristorante della struttura √® la vera sorpresa!

219,Buono!!peccato per..,"hotel buono, camera carina e pulita, letto comodo. Rispetto ad altri hotel come qualit√† prezzo va molto bene. 
peccato per la poca cura verso il cliente dato che dopo aver chiesto ben 4 volte di aggiustare la vasca per poter fare il bagno non √® MAI stato mandato nessuno. se non fosse stato per quella mancanza avrei dato 5 stelle.. per quanto riguarda la 
posizione se non vi interessa ""il caos"" in zona ci sono pub ad ogni angolo che fanno musica dal vivo, se invece volete essere vicini alla zona della movida dei pub pi√π famosi(15 min a piedi dall'hotel) e non avete nessun voglia di camminare la sera questo hotel non va bene per voi dovete andare dalla parte opposta del fiume..",3,2019,08,25
219,Molto confortevole ,"Ho scelto questo albergo per la sua vicinanza a una scuola di inglese che dovevo frequentare. Le camere del settimo piano sono molto grandi, pulite, tecnologiche e confortevoli. La formula club poi permette di avere una lounge dedicata dove per tutto il giorno hai a disposizione bevande e biscotti. La colazione √© molto abbondante e per chi vuole solo una colazione frugale pu√≤ accedere alla lounge, dove dalle sette, portano dolci, cereali e cornetti. Bella l‚Äôidea anche dell‚Äôaperitivo dalle 18,30 alle 19,30 sempre offerto dall‚Äôalbergo.",4,2019,08,24
219,Moderno y funcional,"Hotel muy moderno que adem√°s est√° siendo renovado y creo que ampliado. Est√° bastante c√©ntrico (a cinco minutos andando de O'Connell Steet) y bien comunicado con transporte p√∫blico. La habitaci√≥n que nos toc√≥ es id√©ntica a la de las im√°genes, con una decoraci√≥n moderna y todo est√° bastante limpio. El aislamiento ac√∫stico, como suele ocurrir, no es el mejor y se oyen bastante otras habitaciones. Adem√°s, en nuestro caso, est√°bamos en el primer piso y se o√≠a bastante la calle, aunque no tanto como para molestar por la noche. Eso s√≠, la cama de muelles era un poco blanda (parec√≠a un colch√≥n viejo) y creo que se podr√≠an mejorar.",4,2019,08,23
219,Estuvimos dos veces,"En el recorrido por Irlanda estuvimos el primer y √∫ltimo d√≠a, el primero nos pusieron en la zona nueva y todo maravilloso, 5 estrellas, todo nuevo y comod√≠simo, nos acompa√±aron a la habitaci√≥n y nos llevaron la maleta, el √∫ltimo d√≠a nos pusieron en la zona antigua, tuvimos que subir dos plantas sin ascensor y temblaba la habitaci√≥n cada vez que pasaba un tren (bastante a menudo), tanto en la zona nueva como antigua las habitaciones son muy buenas, pero si pod√©is pedid la zona nueva",4,2019,08,13
219,"Gute Lage f√ºr einen City-Trip, bequeme Betten","Wir sind als Gruppe gereist und durften uns √ºber kostenlose Upgrades zu Premier Rooms freuen. Trotz 6. und 7. Etage gibt es aber lediglich Aussicht in andere Zimmer oder Appartements. Die Zimmer sind zweckm√§ssig ausgestattet, die Matratzen offenbar relativ neu und bequem. 
Die Lage in der N√§he von Bussen, Tram und auch Restaurants/Einkaufsm√∂glichkeiten ist sehr gut geeignet f√ºr einen St√§dtetrip. Die Innenstadt ist auch zu Fuss gut erreichbar.
Verbesserungspotenzial: Im Bad ist die Beleuchtung sehr schwach (ungeeignet f√ºr Make-up oder Rasur). In einem Zimmer hat der Bad-Ventilator nicht funktioniert, in einem die WC-Sp√ºlung nicht richtig. Nichts wurde offenbar von der Reinigungsequipe bemerkt oder gemeldet - schade, das erwartet man eigentlich. Die Fliesenfugen sind teilweise schlecht mit Silikon gef√ºllt und schmuddelig.
Die Aufz√ºge sind in einem schlechten technischen Zustand oder √ºberlastet. Sie sind jeden Tag ausgefallen, manchmal einzeln, manchmal sogar gleichzeitig.
Etwas anstrengend empfanden wir auch, dass sich die Zimmer-Zutrittskarten immer wieder entladen haben.
Das Caf√© ‚ÄûThe Parlor‚Äú eignet sich am Morgen f√ºr einen ersten Kaffee oder Cappuccino. Vom angebotenen, ohnehin sehr √ºbersichtlichen √† la Carte-Fr√ºhst√ºck war allerdings schon fr√ºh kaum noch etwas verf√ºgbar.",4,2019,08,12

Ottima la prima colazione, anche se pi√π ricca quella irlandese rispetto a quella continentale. A 700 metri dallo Spire, l‚Äôhotel √® abbastanza centrale e tutti i maggiori punti d‚Äôinteresse sono raggiungibili a piedi.

219,Toccata e fuga a dublino,"Sicuramente √® un bell hotel. la camera premier √® grande, ci sono tutte le amenit√† di un 4 stelle (accappatoio ciabattine macchina caff√® frigobar ecc) c'√®  la presenza del balconcino, ottima pulizia, buona colazione. Perfetto il wifi. Valida anche la posizione a due passi dal bus per l aeroporto, davanti la stazione e ciononostante vicina al fiume ed al centro.
 Avremmo preferito una doccia non inserita nella vasca, degli ascensori con una pi√π rapida apertura delle porte. Magari la stanza executive potrebbe esser dotata di qualcosa in pi√π oltre a caff√®, biscotti, acqua e talvolta frutta. In realt√† c erano le brioche la mattina ma utili solo per chi non aveva scelto la colazione inclusa.
Ma la cosa che ci ha dato fastidio ed ha provocato un abbassamento del comfort e per conseguenza del giudizio √® il sistema di aerazione: oltre a raffreddare la stanza anche con il termostato spento, l'apparato provocava un rumore continuo poich√© tutta la struttura √® posta sull edificio davanti (distante pochi metri) e l aria viene convogliata attraverso un condotto che scorre proprio accanto alla camera 767 che √® quella assegnataci e che recensiamo.",3,2019,06,29

219,Molto buono,"Confortevole e molto tranquillo. A pochi minuti dal centro, personale molto cordiale e sempre disponibile. Pulizia puntuale e non invasiva. Peccato solo per il brutto panorama e i sensori luce di terra che si accendevano nel mezzo della notte. Per il resto, perfetto",4,2019,02,04
219,Sehr gutes Hotel in Toplage f√ºr St√§dtetrip,"Wir haben in einem Dreibettzimmer gewohnt, Platz war genug. Das Hotel liegt an der Bahn, die h√∂rt man aber gar nicht. Die Hotelfront t√§uscht, das eigentliche Hotel liegt weiter hinten! Nach einem Tag war unsere Klimaanlage kaputt. Da √ºbers Wochenende kein Installateur zu bekommen war, konnten wir zwischen einem neuen Zimmer und einer kleinen Heizung w√§hlen. Wir haben die Heizung genommen, die prompt gebracht wurde. Parken kann man gegen√ºber beim √∂ffentlichen Park & Ride der Bahnstation f√ºr 9 ‚Ç¨ /24 h. Fu√üweg dahin ca 250 m. Fr√ºhst√ºck war v√∂llig okay, wir haben allerdings nur einmal dort gefr√ºhst√ºckt waren sonst in einer der gem√ºtlichen Kaffes in der N√§he! Vor allem die Lage und das freundliche Hotelpersonal bei angemessen Preisen sprechen f√ºr das Northstar! W√ºrden dort wieder √ºbernachten!",5,2019,01,29

219,Soggiorno capodanno,"Ho soggiornato per 5 notti presso questa struttura!
Location molto underground infatti dalla reception c‚Äô√® il passaggio del treno, quindi non fatevi prendere dal panico! Ovviamente non reca nessun fastidio! Solo stupore.

Belli gli arredi esterni dell hotel.
La mia camera era una king superior al 7 piano vicino il club lounge, ampia con letto alto, unica pecca.... il micro bagno!

Ubicato nei pressi della via dello shopping di o connell street, l attrazione pi√π distante dall hotel √® la guinness e dista 2 km. Per il resto a piedi ci si arriva dappertutto.

Ho fatto colazione presso il the parlor buona la black forest cake con cappuccino.
 
Unico disguido √® stato al cenone di capodanno, nonostante avessi riservato il tavolo, non mi √® stato dato un voucher che confermasse il tutto! Quindi risultava nulla la prenotazione... per√≤ tutto √® stato risolto in qualche minuto.

Ottimo soggiorno!",4,2019,01,02
219,HOTEL CON CIERTA CALIDAD AUNQUE MEJORABLE.,"Se trata de un hotel con habitaciones completamente renovadas aunque unos pasillos y habitaciones donde hay que reformar el suelo ya que sigue teniendo el suelo antiguo crujiente de madera al que solo le han puesto la moqueta, con lo que al caminar cualquier persona cercana a tu habitaci√≥n todo cruje y por la noche se nota bastante. 
El desayuno buffet es bastante mejorable sobre todo el caf√© que es pura achicoria sin ninguna calidad.

El desayuno buffett me gust√≥ bastante y el Pub es precioso. A m√≠ no me cost√≥ caro pagu√© sobre 45‚Ç¨ por noche, eso s√≠ he visto unos precios ahora desorbitados que no se ajustan al hotel.

Para acceder a mi habitaci√≥n en planta primera no hab√≠a ascensor de modo que ten√≠as que subir las maletas a mano por las escaleras.

Il personale √® molto gentile e disponibile per qualsiasi esigenza, le stanze vengono pulite ogni giorno e si vede perch√© sono veramente pulite.
L'unica pecca √® non trovare nemmeno una presa europea in stanza per poter ricaricare il cellulare e se si chiede un adattatore questo viene venduto dalla struttura al costo di 5‚Ç¨, per il resto √® tutto veramente perfetto se dovessi tornare a Dublino sicuramente ritornerei in questa struttura.",5,2018,08,23

Al suo interno c‚Äô√® anche un ristorante molto, molto buono con prezzi assolutamente giusti ed una cucina davvero da provare. Che altro dire..... Super Consigliato!!!",5,2018,07,14
219,"Gut gelegen, √ºberraschend modern!","Bei meinen fr√ºheren Gesch√§ftsreisen nach DUB weilte ich jeweils im Spencer Hotel nahe dem Fluss, doch diese voll war, erlaubten die Preis-Vorschriften nur das North Star als Alternative. Im Nachhinein eigentlich ein Gl√ºcksfall! Vorausgesetzt man ist im modernen Teil einquartiert, welches sich ‚ÄûThe Adress‚Äú nennt, hat man ein top modernes Zimmer. OK, die Aussicht vom 3ten Stock ist alles andere als umwerfend und die unmittelbar vor dem Fenster vorbeifahrenden DARTs sind schon fast Kult, aber das Hotel sieht von Innen aus als w√§r‚Äôs ein trendiges Boutique Hotel. In den Zimmern hat es keine Mitteleurop√§ischen Stecker womit ich an der Rezeption einen kaufen musste - ausleihen geht nicht. Leider wird das Fr√ºhst√ºck im fensterlosen Keller serviert, aber das Angebot ist gut und die Bedienung freundlich. √úberhaupt ist das ganze Personal √§usserst freundlich und hilfsbereit. Obwohl ich bereits am Morgen ausgecheckt hatte, konnte ich mein Gep√§ck so lange ich wollte einstellen. Ich konnte mich sogar um die Mittagszeit noch umziehen und nochmals abgeben ‚Äì alles unkompliziert und selbstverst√§ndlich.

Il personale √® stato super gentile e disponibile per soddisfare ogni mia richiesta. Abbiamo fatto colazione al the parlor e siamo rimaste pienamente soddisfatte. 
Il prezzo √® in linea con quanto presente a Dublino ma lo standard di servizio e pulizia e nettamente superiore.
Sono rimasta pienamente soddisfatta e l‚Äôhotel ha superato ogni aspettativa.",5,2018,06,17
219,gutes City-Hotel mit kleinen √úberraschungen,"Wir waren af Bus-Rundreise in Irland und dieses Hotel war der Start- als auch der Endpunkt unserer Reise. Zu Beginn waren wir im ""hinteren"" Teil des Hotels eigentlich sehr angenehm untergebracht. Beim zweiten Aufenthalt erhielten wir ein (gro√ües) Zimmer zur Stra√üe im vorderen Teil des Hotels. Diese Zimmer sind nicht √ºber einen Fahrstuhl zu erreichen, aber die Angestellten sind freundlich und hilfsbereit. Zutritt zu allen Bereichen √ºbrigends nur mittels der Schl√ºsselkarten! Bei Bezug des Zimmers lag eindeutig der Geruch nach Bratkartoffeln in der Luft und das Radio spielte (anh√∂rbare) Pop-Musik. Welches Radio?? Die Ger√§schkulisse wurde √ºber die L√ºftungsanlage aus der darunter gelegenen Bar eingespielt und wurde nach Abschalten der Klimaanlage noch etwas lauter. Der Mann am Front-Desk erkl√§rte auf Nachfrage, das die Lautst√§rke auch gedimmt werden k√∂nne, aber sp√§testens um 23:00 uhr eh beendet wird. Nach ausgiebigem Stadtrundgang empfand ich die Musikkulisse erst als st√∂rend, dann aber doch angenehm zum Einschlafen und war schon fast etwas ver√§rgert, als die Musik√ºbertragung schon um Mitternacht eingestellt wurde. Anscheinend hat Irland aber ein Problem mit den Wasserabfl√ºssen in den Badezimmern. Die Waschbecken scheinen imer verstopft zu sein und fliessen eben nur sehr langsam ab. Das Hotel liegt ca. 12 - 15 Gehminuten zur City. Um die ecke in der Talbot-Street gibt es einen tollen Pub ""The Celt"", welcher touristisch noch nicht so erschlossen ist, wie der Temple Bar-Bezirk. Anschluss-N√§chte haben wir hier nicht verbracht, da m.E. zu teuer. Vorherige Kritiken zur Lautst√§rke der angrenzenden Bahn konnten wir nicht best√§tigen.",3,2018,06,16
219,3 nights in Dublin,"The hotel is very well located and  the rooms are well . I don‚Äô t like that there are stairs instead of elevator in some parts of the hotel and  I was on the second floor and there isn‚Äôt a elevator.  The train station is very near so there are a lot of noises sometimes. 
I like the beds and the bathroom is well. The room is very comfortable. 
We want to leave the room later and they told us that we have to pay 10‚Ç¨ / hour. A very expensive hour!!
El hotel est√° a 15 minutos del centro y de la parte tur√≠stica de Dublin.
 Las habitaciones est√°n bien , con unas camas grandes y c√≥modas, y la televisi√≥n tambi√©n est√° bien aunque no la disfrutamos mucho. El ba√±o tambi√©n correcto. Todo muy limpio. Hab√≠a plancha , secador y frigor√≠fico. La √∫nica pega es que hab√≠a moqueta pero supongo que all√≠ es normal. 
Otro inconveniente es que en la parte donde est√°bamos alojados no hab√≠a ascensor y est√°bamos en la segunda planta. 
Y lo √∫ltimo aunque estuvimos poco es que el tren pasa muy cerca del hotel ... y se nota por el ruido. No es algo exagerado pero se nota.
Y por √∫ltimo a√±adir que quedarse m√°s tiempo en la habitaci√≥n supone la cantidad de 10‚Ç¨ la hora. Y no s√© si esto es as√≠ en m√°s hoteles de Dublin pero en otros hoteles donde me he alojado si no se alojaba nadie despu√©s te dejaban un poco m√°s sin cargo. No digo q te quedes tres horas mas gratis pero me parece excesivo. 
Un detalle muy bueno es el t√© y caf√© que tienes disponible es la habitaci√≥n aunque el a√±o pasado estuve en el hotel beresford y tb lo daban con galleta incluida.
Lo recomendar√≠a por la habitaci√≥n y por la cercan√≠a al centro.",3,2018,06,09
219,Splendido e centrale,"Passate 4 notti splendide. Ottima posizione per cui in 5 minuti a piedi sei allo spillone e quindi in centro . Splendido 4 stelle ristrutturato e molto moderno, anche se dal fuori rimane un vecchio palazzo. Colazione splendida",5,2018,06,07
219,sch√∂ne Unterkunft,"Das Hotel ist ordentlich und sauber, der Empfang sowie der Service sind sehr gut.
Leider haben mich die gesprungenen Flie√üen und der knierschende Boden im Zimmer irritiert.....

La mia camera inoltre aveva una splendida vista sulla stazione. Bench√© i treni passassero letteralmente sotto la mia camera non mi hanno per niente disturbato.
Non era prevista colazione ma c'era una lounge al piano che offrire bevande frutta e dolci.
Comodo per muoversi a piedi. Solo il wifi non funzionava un gran che bene",4,2018,05,17
219,Zur √úbernachtung okay,"Tolle Lage, leider sehr hellh√∂rig und die Zimmerreinigung l√§sst zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig. Au√üerdem fallen die Zimmert√ºren sehr laut ins Schlo√ü. Unser Zimmer in der zweiten Etage hatte leider nur einen Blick in den nicht ganz so sch√∂nen Innenhof.
Das Doppelbett f√ºr zwei Personen √ºber 1,80m war leider ziemlich knapp bemessen und die Matratze war so empfindlich, dass man jede Bewegung des anderen mitbekommen hat (vergleichbar wohl mit einem Wassserbett).",3,2018,05,07

219,Ottimo,"Da fuori l'hotel sembra brutto, ma dentro √® davvero delizioso.Le camere sono eleganti e pulite e di notte, appena ti muovi, si accendono delle luci sia in camera che in bagno.... questo √® un po' fastidioso. Ho trovato eccessiva la temperatura della stanza, ma mi √® piaciuto che ci fossero sempre The e caff√® a disposizione. Ci si arriva comodamente con l'autobus dall' aeroporto e tutto sommato non √® molto lontano dal centro, raggiungibile con una passeggiata, di buon passo, di una quindicina di minuti. Il ristorante al piano terra offre buon cibo a prezzi accettabili. Consigliato.",5,2018,05,02

219,Al centro di Dublino con tutti i confort,"insieme alla mia famiglia, due adulti e due ragazzi di 16 e 12 anni, abbiamo soggiornato in hotel per tre notti. Si arriva direttamente dall'aeroporto con il bus di linea 747 che ferma a pochi metri dall'albergo. La hall √® molto ampia e dalla stessa si accede alle camere. ad un bar, un pub e un ristorante, tutti molto caretteristici. Le stanze molto confortevoli e moderne avevano due letti matrimoniali veramente comodi, un bagno sufficientemente grande con vasca. Il wi-fi libero √® accessibile sia nelle camere che nell'intero albergo. Per quanto ci riguarda abbiamo preferito non aggiungere la colazione, perch√© viene proposta solo con il costo di una all'inglese, mentre noi avremmo preso caff√® e cornetto, ma non ci sono stati problemi poich√© nella strada a fianco, ci sono numerosi bar con la possibilit√† di fare colazione con qualsiasi cibo. La posizione dell'albergo √® strategica, a pochi metri la stazione Connolly con treni per l'interland e verso il mare con alta frequenza; poco pi√π avanti bus per le varie citt√† d'Irlanda, e quasi avanti all'albergo fermata del bus per l'aeroporto e tutte le linee per il centro e la periferia. Non si deve sottovalutare che si pu√≤ raggiungere in meno di 10 minuti la centralissima the Spire. Devo segnalare la cordialit√† e tutti i preziosi consigli che ci sono stati dati da Daniel durante il chek in.
Quindi sono certo che il North Stars sar√† il mio alloggio quando torner√≤ a Dublino.",5,2018,04,29
219,Wuerde ich wieder machen,"Das Hotel liegt zwar direkt an der Hauptstra√üe und optisch f√§hrt der eine Bahn durch, aber davon haben wir nichts mitbekommen. Das Personal war freundlich und die Zimmer sauber. Es liegt mega zentral und man l√§uft gem√ºtlich ca 10 - 15 zum Zentrum, wo z.B. die Hop on/off Busse fahren, sich die bekannte Temple Bar oder neue Victoria Secret Store befindet.. ",4,2018,04,15
219,Niente di speciale.,"Al momento di scegliere l'albergo, il North Star Hotel era uno dei pi√π accessibili per quanto riguarda il prezzo (sempre abbastanza caro dato che si parla pur sempre di un 4 stelle a Dublino). La mia esperienza in questo hotel √® stata discreta: posizione buona, molte fermate dell'autobus  e del filobus vicine alla struttura, che ci hanno permesso di raggiungere in breve attrazioni lontane da Dublino centro. 
Hotel carino, con camera tuttavia molto essenziale e, nel mio caso che avevo  una stanza a piano terra, con brutta vista che dava su una specie di piccolo cortile in cui stavano facendo lavori.
Colazione qualitativamente nella media, ma molto ristretta e poco varia, inoltre qualora si volesse accedere alle tipiche pietanze della colazione irlandese era richiesto un supplemento nonostante la colazione fosse inclusa nel pacchetto.
Pulizia delle camere discreta, ma non impeccabile.
Non mi sento di sconsigliarlo, per√≤, come preannunciato nel titolo, non √® niente di speciale.",3,2018,04,15
219,Un buen hotel centr√≠co,"El hotel tiene dos partes - North Star, de nivel un poco m√°s bajo, y the Address, supuestamente m√°s lujoso.

219,nie wieder!,"das hotel liegt zwischen bahn und strasse. das zimmer lag im 1 stock ohne lift mit direktem blick auf die strasse. wenn der zug vorbei ratterte klipperte und r√ºttelte es wobei ich nicht die minibar damit meinte, da es eine solche gar nicht im zimmer gab. der hammer war dann am n√§chsten morgen, dass es nur kaltes wasser gab zum duschen. nachdem ich reklamierte wurde mir versprochen sofort was dagegen zu unternehmen. als ich nach dem halbt√§gigen stadtbummel zur√ºck ins hotel kam wusste dann niemand von diesem problem bescheid, was dann dazu f√ºhrte,  dass ich das zimmer in den 2 stock (ohne Lift) wechseln konnte. und hier funktionierte dann der tv nicht...
das fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet im fensterlosen kellergeschoss war dann auch so ein highlight, so dass ich gut auf dieses verzichten konnte und mir halt irgenwo in dublin ein fr√ºhst√ºck besorgte.

A este le sobran 4.",1,2017,09,14
219,Con grandi margini di miglioramento! ,"La reception √® molto piacevole, i receptionist accoglienti e gentili. La stanza... decisamente meno curata: vecchiotta, come il bagno; Sufficientemente spaziosa e silenziosa nonostante la posizione ( vicino alla ferrovia) , viene riordinata tutti i gg ma non lavata: il bambino che girava con le calze addosso dopo qualche minuto si ritrovava le calze nere. Terribile. 
Colazione: da evitare!! Carissima, di qualit√† mediocre ma soprattutto posizionata al piano -1 senza finestre , con un'aria nauseabonda, irrespirabile.
Consiglio invece il locale di fronte alla reception, dove la cameriera, gentilissima, pu√≤ servire scones, croissant, torte caff√® e bevande varie: molto carino, pulitissimo e servito con cura.

L'hotel si trova a pochi passi dalle attrazioni della citt√† e non particolarmente distante dall'aeroporto, il personale √® accogliente e la camera pulita. 
La zona √® ben servita dagli autobus che vanno sia in direzione centro, sia in direzione aeroporto e la fermata si trova a pochi metri dall'hotel.
Molto buono anche il ristorante della struttura che, oltre ad un menu curato, offre un servizio veloce e gentile.
Il prezzo √® stato a mio avviso inferiore alla media, considerato il periodo dell'anno. 
Mi sono trovata mio bene e lo consiglio a tutti!",5,2017,08,03
219,Leider nein.,"Mit einem Kollegenpaar haben wir uns ein sch√∂nes verl√§ngertes Wochenende in Dublin geg√∂nnt. Bei der Buchung dachten wir: ""Sehr cool, so nah am Zentrum und so g√ºnstig f√ºr 4 Sterne"". (Man soll ja immer einen Stern dazu buchen) Bei der Ankunft haben wir dann bemerkt, warum das so war. Wir buchten zwei Classic Doppelzimmer mit King-Size Bett. Diese Zimmer sind ganz sicher nicht 4 Sterne w√ºrdig. Ich w√ºrde hier maximal 3 Sterne bewerten. Die Dusche verhielt sich eher wie ein gerinsel. Unsere Frauen ben√∂tigen eine gef√ºhlte Stunde, um den Schaum aus dem Haar zu sp√ºlen. Das Zimmer war sehr klein, wir konnten kaum unsere zwei Koffer aufklappen. Der Teppich auf dem Boden war eher schmuddelig, als edel. Direkt vor dem Zimmerfenster gab es Gitterst√§be, wie im Gef√§ngnis. Nach der ersten Nacht haben wir dann das Fr√ºhst√ºck noch nachgebucht. Die bezahlten 12.90 ‚Ç¨ war das niemals wert. Der Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum war unterirdisch und nicht sehr gem√ºtlich. 
Ich denke wenn man hier eine h√∂here Zimmerkategorie bucht, w√§re das besser. Beim Eingang wird schliesslich mit modernen und sch√∂nen Zimmern geworben. 
Trotzallem sind wir nett empfangen worden und der Service im Hotel an der Reception war gut und freundlich. Am Schluss unseres Aufenthaltes durften wir unsere Koffer wegschliessen lassen, damit wir ohne Gep√§ck noch ein letztes Mal die Stadt erkunden konnten.",2,2017,08,01
219,"Solide, sauber, zentral! Positiver Aufenthalt!","Das North Star Hotel liegt im Zentrum von Dublin. In die Fu√üg√§ngerzone sind es 10 und zur Temple Bar sind es 25 Minuten zu Fu√ü. In unmittelbarer N√§he befindet sich eine Bahnstation. 

Der Empfang war schnell und das Personal ist sehr freundlich, stets hilfsbereit und mit Rat und Tat schnell zur Stelle. Die Zimmer und das Bad waren sehr sauber, gepflegt, neuwertig und ohne Schn√∂rkel. Insgesamt ist es sehr ruhig und von der nebenan befindlichen Bahnlinie hat man nichts mitbekommen. W-LAN ist kostenfrei und funktionierte stets ohne Probleme. 

Ein hervorzuhebendes Merkmal ist das Fr√ºhst√ºck. Im Kellergeschoss gibt es einen Saal mit einem reichhaltigen kostenpflichtigen Fr√ºhst√ºck was aber eher irisch/englisch gepr√§gt ist. Kostenfrei gibt es dagegen ein kleineres Buffet mit wenigen Beilagen, Kaffee und Saft im Aufenthaltsraum mit Blick auf die Stadt. Wer also kein Fr√ºhst√ºcksmensch ist, f√ºr den ist das Angebot perfekt geeignet. 

Insgesamt ein sehr positiver Aufenthalt und uneingeschr√§nkt zu empfehlen!",4,2017,07,29
219,Verbesserungsf√§hig,"Wir wollten ein schickes zentrales Hotel und haben extra etwas mehr Geld ausgegeben. Leider waren wir etwas entt√§uscht. Schon im Flur war es sehr warm, so auch im Zimmer.

Auch die B√§der waren alt und entsprechen somit keinem 4Sterne Standard in Deutschland vllt aber in Irland. 
Sehr st√∂rend waren die Bauarbeiten im Hinterhof genau unter den Fenstern. Die Arbeiter waren immer p√ºnktlich um 6Uhr um uns zu wecken, trotz verschlossenen Fenster und Vorhang!

Arrivati alla reception, davvero bella e molto curata, ci viene indicata la nostra stanza: piccola, sporca, dagli arredi vecchi e con un piccolo calorifero a terra, da commutare manualmente, che non funzionava. Inoltre la finestra della stanza dava proprio su Amiens Street (la via dell'albergo), trafficatissima, rumorosissima e tutto questo per ben 200‚Ç¨ a notte! Indignati, a seguito delle nostre proteste, ci viene cambiata la stanza con una pi√π spaziosa e con il riscaldamento finalmente in funzione. Il bagno, vecchio e logoro comprendeva una doccia poco funzionale e con il miscelatore rotto: impossibile regolare la giusta temperatura dell'acqua. Riuscire a dormire poi √® stata un'impresa, in quanto le stanze mancano completamente di insonorizzazione. Si sentono tutti i rumori prodotti dagli altri ospiti nei corridoi e dalla strada, in quanto i vetri degli infissi sono molto sottili, probabilmente perch√® non sono mai stati rinnovati. Colazione all'irlandese (esclusa, costo 12,50‚Ç¨) niente male ma con proposte quasi esclusivamente salate. Nota positiva il ristorante annesso all'albergo, molto carino e con una buona offerta di piatti tipici.",1,2017,05,02

Tras un laber√≠ntico recorrido llegamos a la habitaci√≥n familiar, m√°s peque√±a de lo que suele ser habitual para albergar dos camas individuales y una doble, y sin nevera mini-bar. Pero lo peor es el lavabo: feo, descuidado y vetusto, completamente indigno de un hotel que dice ser de cuatro estrellas. Y cuando, tras recorrer todos los fant√°sticos rincones de Dubl√≠n, llega el momento del descanso, se entiende lo del t√∫nel de la recepci√≥n, puesto que el ruido de los trenes que pasan literalmente por encima del hotel es el hilo musical. Suerte que el cansancio pasa factura y uno se acaba durmiendo casi en cualquier circunstancia. En cuanto a las vistas, podr√≠amos calificarlas de curiosas: obreros subiendo y bajando de los andamios desde las siete de la ma√±ana, construyendo una parte nueva del hotel a un metro escaso de la ventana de la habitaci√≥n. Ninguna explicaci√≥n, comentario o disculpa por parte del personal, deben considerarlo normal. La ubicaci√≥n del hotel es buena y permite acercarse al centro en menos de un cuarto de hora paseando, pero seguro que en la ciudad han de haber mejores alojamientos por el mismo precio, si volvemos a Dubl√≠n buscaremos otro hotel.",2,2016,09,25
219,Congreso en Dubl√≠n,"Excelente opci√≥n para estar cerca del Convention Centre of Dublin, bien comunicado con el aeropuerto y al lado del centro. Buen restaurante con horarios m√°s amplios que los de alrededor. A tener en cuenta que el check-in es a las 14:00 y no antes ",5,2016,08,31
219,"Buon hotel ""con treno in camera"" ","Siamo stati in questo hotel con un gruppo, l'hotel molto vicino alla stazione di Connolly e a 15 min a piedi da O'connell Street e temple bar 
Tuttosommato l'hotel sembra rinnovato da poco la nostra camera era bella e pulita con un letto comodo... purtroppo senza vista o meglio con vista impalcatura e muro di fronte. Nonostante l'insonorizzazione il treno che passa a 10mt si sente eccome! Lo sciacquone del wc non funzionava...e per farlo funzionare bisognava alzare il pesante coperchio di ceramica ed inserire le mani dentro per azionare lo sblocco...(cosa normale per un 4 stelle???) Sembra impossibile che gli addetti delle pulizie non abbiano notato una cosa del genere!! 
L'hotel dispone di una sala ristoro

219,kein 4 Sterne Hotel,"Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Baustelle direkt vor dem Fenster. Auf Nachfrage begannen die Arbeiten zwischen 7 und 9 Uhr. Ein anderes Zimmer wurde in Aussicht gestellt jedoch blieben wir nur eine Nacht und da gab es dann wohl doch keine M√∂glichkeiten. Das Bad war eine Katastrophe - auch f√ºr irische Verh√§ltnisse. Die Dusche hing nur an der Wasserleitung, Seifenspender und Haltegriff hielten nicht mehr (waren am Abfallen sobald man sie ber√ºhrte), eine Badmatte die ich nutzen wollte, da man sich ja nirgends festhalten konnte, da alles rausbrach was in der Wand verankert war, stand vor Dreck, Schimmel und Haare von fremden Personen. Die M√§ngel wurden angesprochen, da kam ein Entschuldigung und das war es. Wir haben f√ºr das Zimmer fast 160 ‚Ç¨ bezahlt - eben weil wir etwas sch√∂nes zum Ende unseres Urlaubes haben wollten. Auch alle 3 Sterne Hotels die wir gesehen haben, waren auf einem besseen Standart und haben definitiv weniger gekostet. Mein Mann und ich beschweren uns i.d.R. nicht und wir reisen durchschnittlich viel  (sind ca. 20 Tage im Jahr in Hotels) und das war mit Abstand das schlechteste Hotel was wir gesehen haben (wir reisen auch nur in 3-4 Sterne Hotels). Hier hatten uns die doch eher positiven Bewertungen √ºberzeugt - und der Preis, wodurch ich von einem gewissen Standart ausgegangen war. Zum Gl√ºck hatten wir nur eine Nacht gebucht, das war das einzige erfeuliche an unserem Aufenthalt. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck was hier hoch gelobt wurde, war auch in anderen Hotels √§hnlich reichhaltig - ich sehe 2 Sorten K√§se und Wurst nicht als √ºberragend vielf√§ltig an. Aber ja, es gibt Hotels da ist es nur 1 Sorte...Highlight sind die Pannkakes, die aber aus der Maschine kommen und m.E. auch nicht √ºberragend schmeckten.",1,2016,08,21
219,Mala experiencia,"Lo positivo a sacar de este hotel es la amabilidad del personal y la limpieza de la habitaci√≥n y comodidad de la cama a pesar de que es peque√±a. En cuanto ha aspectos negativos: nos colocaron en la peor habitaci√≥n del hotel, la 156. En un supuesto hotel de 4 estrellas est√° habitaci√≥n no deber√≠a existir, situada en la planta baja la primera habitaci√≥n que te encuentras desde la recepci√≥n con una puerta para acceder al pasillo frente a ella que se abre y se cierra constantemente por la cantidad de gente que pasa por ah√≠. Todo el mundo que se aloja en el hotel pasa por delante de tu puerta tanto para ir a su habitaci√≥n si se alojan en la misma planta como para coger el ascensor si lo hacen en otra planta y encima el cuarto donde guardan las cosas las limpiadoras esta justo al lado con lo cual ruido constante. Imposible descansar en condiciones. Adem√°s la ventana de la habitaci√≥n da a una calle trasera debajo de un puente de la v√≠a del tren con lo cual entra poqu√≠sima luz. Para colmo una pareja que se hospedaba en las habitaciones colindantes discutiendo y chillando en el pasillo y donde portazos.  Una experiencia horrible. Todav√≠a sigo buscando las 4 estrellas porque donde √∫nicamente las encuentro es en el precio casi 200 ‚Ç¨ la noche. ",2,2016,08,19

219,Ottimo Hotel vicino al centro! ,"Ottimo hotel vicino alla stazione Connolly station. Abbiamo alloggiato nella camera n. 366 e devo dire che non abbiamo sentito molti rumori stando molto vicino ai vari tram che girano nella zona. Il personale √® molto accogliente e al minimo problema interviene per risolverlo. Eravamo in due e ci hanno dato una camera per tre persone, il letto era comodissimo. Con il bagno (essendo italiane) non ci siamo trovate cosi tanto bene.. Il bidet mancava e il doccino era fisso, ma alla fine siamo a Dublino e quindi ci si deve adattare alle usanze irlandesi.  Per il resto √® un hotel fantastico.. Consigliatissimo! ",5,2016,08,08

Il phon - non si capisce per quale motivo - √® occultato in un cassetto e non si pu√≤ togliere, ma io non riuscivo nemmeno ad usarlo in piedi. Il bagno poco attrezzato e minuscolo, l'aria condizionata malfunzionante e rumorosa, la finestra direttamente a livello strada, i corridoi un vero dedalo con temperature infernali.

219,Unfreundlich und bescheidene Qualit√§,"Die Anfahrt mit dem PW ist nicht ratsam, da die Parkm√∂glichkeiten beschr√§nkt sind. Die Reception zeigt wenig Interesse die G√§ste dabei zu unterst√ºtzen. Einziger Vorteil ist die N√§he zur Fussg√§ngerzone. Der Empfang ist allgemein ziemlich desinteressiert. Der Weg zu den Zimmern gleicht einem Hindernislauf, ist schlecht beschildert und schlicht eine Zumutung. Wie hat die Feuerpolizei wohl die Fluchtwege abgenommen? Das Zimmerfenster geht zu einem alten, v√∂llig verschmutzten Bauger√ºst vor einer dunklen Wand. Eine Zumutung. Die Klimaanlage k√ºhlt kaum, macht aber einen L√§rm wie ein startendes Flugzeug. Das Badezimmer ist √§usserst bescheiden. Der Pausenraum ist wohl ein umgebauter Keller ohne Fenster. Das Personal ist distanziert und das Angebot bescheiden. Woher kommen nur die vier Sterne?

219,"Dublino, North Star Hotel: posizione eccellente a due passi dalla stazione e dal centro","Dove andare a dormire a Dublino? Case georgiane o hotel? This is the question.

Mi sono a lungo interrogata su dove andare a dormire a Dublino. Dal momento che in questo viaggio oltre a mia figlia Martina c'erano anche le mie nipoti Chiara e Valentina inizialmente ho cercato una sistemazione in una struttura ricettiva ricavata in una casa georgiana, cio√® quel tipo di architettura che √® nato  tra il 1714 e il 1830 durante il regno di quattro Re Giorgio d‚ÄôInghilterra (e che a Dublino √® ben conservata e rappresentata), con l'obiettivo di calarci nell'atmosfera il pi√π possibile.

Purtroppo ho dovuto rinunciare in quanto le recensioni sulla sistemazione che avevo trovato erano discordanti ma, soprattutto, in parecchie concordavano sul fatto che la struttura era s√¨ affascinante e centrale, ma che necessitava di un bel restyling. Quindi per prudenza, considerate figlia e nipoti, ho preferito optare per una soluzione pi√π tradizionale ma, dal mio punto di vista, pi√π sicura e cercare un hotel. La scelta √® ricaduta sul North Star Hotel che ho prenotato direttamente: quadrupla con prima colazione inclusa.

Il North Star Hotel √® in posizione eccellente, proprio dirimpetto alla Connoly Station e dietro la fermata dell'Aerlink, a cinque minuti a piedi dall'inizio del centro. E' anche dotato di cookhouse&amp;bar: il McGettigans √® aperto per il lunch e per la cena.

Per gli appassionati di letteratura: c'√® una suite con vista splendida intitolata a James Joyce.",5,2016,05,14
219,Tutto assolutamente perfetto,"Io e il mio moroso abbiamo alloggiato in questo hotel 5 notti. che dire tutto assolutamente perfetto: la struttura √® molto confortevole e ben arredata, bella stanza con bagno comodo, la colazione √® ottima e variegata, c'√® anche un bar dove mi sono fermata spesso a bere un buon te caldo. l'hotel √® vicino a connoly station e alla fermata dell'autobus che in 5 Min vi porta in centro, oppure andando a piedi la distanza √® davvero minima. il ragazzo Sean alla reception √® stato veramente in gamba, simpatico, gentile e professionale, ci ha aiutati in tutto e per tutto dandoci tutte le informazioni che gli chiedevamo, parlando lentamente e scandendo bene le parole in modo che entrambi riuscissimo a capire. davvero super lo ringraziamo ancora molto. 
nel complesso se dovessi tornare una seconda volta a dublino sicuramente mi fermerei di nuovo in questo hotel anche perch√© il prezzo √® stato conveniente

219,In Summe eine dunkle Angelegenheit ;-(,"Das Zimmer lag im Erdgescho√ü direkt zum Gehsteig der Stra√üe ausgerichtet --> Intimsph√§re nur mit geschlossenen Vorh√§ngen, weil die Fu√üg√§nger quasi neben dem Bett vorbeigelaufen sind.

219,Una opci√≥n recomendable para visitar Dublin,"Se encuentra a 5' andando de la famosa O'Connel Street, por lo que a partir de ah√≠ alcanzar otras ubicaciones emblem√°ticas de Dubl√≠n es verdaderamente f√°cil. Por otro lado, tanto para la ida como para la vuelta su comunicaci√≥n con el aeropuerto es muy f√°cil con el Airlink Bus (opci√≥n mucho m√°s econ√≥mica que cualquier otra para ese traslado). Dentro de los hoteles que hay en Dublin y teniendo en cuenta que es un 4*, su precio es adecuado. Habitaci√≥n bastante adecuada y la limpieza tambi√©n. Si tuviera que se√±alar algo mejorable es que se trata de un hotel muy grande y por tanto el servicio es algo impersonal. Al viajar al extranjero esperar√≠as m√°s consejos y explicaciones por parte del personal pero estos no se dan salvo que los solicites y el detalle en los mismos depende de a qui√©n se lo solicites y tu nivel de comprensi√≥n del ingl√©s (decir de paso que el accento irland√©s no es de los m√°s sencillos de entender).",4,2016,04,30
219,Ideal f√ºr ein verl√§ngertes Wochenende,"Wir (mein Sohn und ich) haben anl√§sslich der 100-Jahr-Feier des Oster-Aufstandes die Stadt besucht. Uns war es wichtig, dass wir alle Ziele (Talbot Street, GPO, Temple Bar,...) zu Fuss erreichen konnten. Vom North Star Hotel aus ist dies kein Problem. Es liegt auch verkehrsg√ºnstig vom Flughafen aus. (Airlink Bus oder Linie 747 bis Talbot Street) Dann noch 50m und man ist da.
Das Personal an der Rezeption war √ºberaus freundlich und bem√ºht, unseren Aufenthalt so angenehm wie m√∂glich zu machen. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck (sowohl Continental als auch Full Irish) war viel besser, als erwartet. Sogar der Kaffee, welchen ich in Irland gerne gegen Tee eintausche, war bemerkenswert gut.
Unser Zimmer (557) war gro√ü, sauber und modern eingerichtet. Es gab sogar Deutsches Fernsehen, welches wir jedoch nicht nutzten. Das Bett war bequem, mit einer gro√üen Auswahl an Kissen.
Das Auschecken war erwartet problemlos.
Fazit: Ich w√ºrde dieses Hotel aufgrund der o.a. Gr√ºnde bedenkenlos an meine Freunde und Bekannte weiterempfehlen und auch selbst dort wieder einkehren.",5,2016,04,30
219,Immer wieder,WIr waren nun schon zum dritten mal im North Star und werden sicher bei unseren n√§chsten Aufenthalten wieder dort absteigen. Die N√§he zum Bahnhof und der Busstation ist perfekt. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck Full Irish Breakfast........  ,4,2016,04,20
219,Gute Lage,"Das North Star Hotel ist gut gelegen, nicht direkt zentral aber nur ca. 10 Gehminuten zum Custom House und dem Liffey.
Das Hotel ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen ebenso die M√∂bel. Das Zimmer war etwas klein, vorallem weil neben dem Doppelbett noch ein weiteres Bett aufgestellt war.
Insgesamt waren Zimmer und Bad sauber. Der Wasserdruck ist etwas schwach.
Positiv ist der vorhandene Safe zu bewerten, allerdings fehlte ein K√ºhlschrank.
Ein deutsches Fernsehprogramm ( ZDF ) war empfangbar.
Die Zimmer sind sehr hellh√∂rig und bei offenem Fenster schlafen ist wegen des Stra√üenl√§rms nicht m√∂glich obwohl das Zimmer zu einer Seitenstra√üe ausgerichtet war.
In den Fluren des Hotels roch es immer etwas muffig.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck entspricht irischem Standard.

Ansonsten ist das Hotel gut. Das Personal ist freundlich, die Zimmer sauber!

Wenn man dann auf der falschen Seite in einer fremden, belebten Stadt unterwegs ist, dann kann das schon nerven.
Wir haben mehrfach das Areal umrundet, sind dann auf einem Privatparkplatz gefunden in den wir dann versehentlich eingeschlossen wurden und haben dann im Halteverbot angehalten und sind kurz ins Hotel rein um nachzufragen.
Die Zufahrt zu Parkplatz ist direkt rechts vom Hotel und sieht nach allem aus, nur nicht nach einem Parkplatz.
Es geht dort extrem eng her, aber der Parkplatzw√§chter parkt einem das Auto auf Wunsch auch ein.
Das Hotel selbst ist schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen und um den Aufzug zu erreichen muss man zuerst eine Holztreppe hoch und √ºber einen langen, ansteigenden Flur.
Das Zimmer hingegen war modern eingerichtet und sauber und hatte einen kleinen Balkon (hinten raus).
Das Bad war ebenfalls sauber, aber recht klein und dunkel.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck nimmt man im Keller ein. Der Raum ist recht niedrig und auch ein bisschen duster (kein Tageslicht). Das Buffet hatte eine gute Auswahl und es wurde immer wieder frisch nachgelegt.",3,2015,08,19
219,Ottimo per tutto,"Stanza comodissima, bagno all'ultimo grido, asse da stiro e phone. La posizione √® ottimale, a due passi dalle zone di maggiore interesse. Colazione adeguatissima anche al gusto meno abituato ai breakfast continentali: si trovano cereali, latte, pane tostato, marmellate e cornetti caldi. Per i pi√π golosi salsicce, bacon e uova. √à possibile preparare dei pancake con una semplice macchina posta su uno dei tavoli. Consiglio vivamente!!! Unico suggerimento: chiedete stanze raggiungibili con ascensore, parte del secondo piano ne √® sprovvisto! Il personale per√≤ porta il bagaglio per voi.",5,2015,08,13
219,Non pu√≤ essere un 4 stelle,"L'albergo si trova in una posizione abbastanza favorevole peccato che sia l'unica nota di merito. Gi√† entrando nella hall si ha la sensazione di un posto vecchio e poco pulito. Moquette ovunque e questo gi√† fa capire il livello di pulizia. Le stanze sono minuscole i bagni fatiscenti, il lavandino e' talmente piccolo che √® difficile persino lavarsi le mani. In camera non c'√® neanche il frigobar, Inammissibile per un 4 stelle. Non lo consiglio.",2,2015,08,05
219,Etwas in die Jahre gekommen,"Das Hotel bietet ein gutes Preis/Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis und ist f√ºr irische Standards gut ausgestattet. Ein Upgrade vor Ort in ein neu renoviertes Zimmer ist f√ºr rund 30‚Ç¨ m√∂glich und empfehlenswert. Wir buchten ein Familienzimmer. Bad und Technik h√§tten eine Renovierung n√∂tig, da aber alles recht gepflegt war ist es in Ordnung. Die Bar und das Restaurant werden Abends auch von den Locals angesteuert und daher ist immer was los. Ansonsten w√ºrde ich dem Hotel empfehlen die nicht renovierten Zimmer auf die ToDo-Liste zu setzen. Wenn man hier die n√§chsten Jahre unt√§tig bleibt wird sich dies merklich auf den Komfort und die Zufriedenheit der G√§ste auswirken. Insgesamt gibt es von mir trotzdem eine Empfehlung. Das Hotel bem√ºht sich. √úbrigens: in der Lobby gibt es kostenfreien Br√ºhkaffee auf Anfrage. ",3,2015,08,03
219,Excelente,"Muy bueno. La atenci√≥n excelente. Nos recibi√≥ un joven muy agradable de argentina que trabaja en la recepci√≥n. Eso nos ayudo mucho por el idioma. Nos oriento en todo momento.

219,Cerca de la Estaci√≥n Connolly de Dublin,"Es un hotel de 3 estrellas y esta bastante bien, en general, aunque creo que en Irlanda sucede lo mismo que en Italia y otros paises que un 3 estrellas alli es un 2 estrellas aqui, en cuanto a modernidad por lo menos. Estuvimos solo 4 dias, incluia el desayuno tipo buffet, el cual era bastante variado aunque la leche ""caliente"" siempre estaba fria a las 8 am...pero lo decias y la calentaban. El personal amable, las habitaciones bien, el ba√±o tenia la cadena un poco regular y el agua de la ducha poquita presi√≥n pero te podias duchar bien, por lo dem√°s todo correcto. No est√° muy centrico pero tampoco muy apartado,lo mejor es que tienes la estaci√≥n de tren al lado. Nuestra habitaci√≥n no era ruidosa.",3,2015,07,15
219,Mehr Schein als sein,"Wir hatten f√ºr zwei N√§chte gebucht. Der erste Eindruck war gut. Die Reception und der Eingangsbereich einladend. Jedoch wenn es weiter geht fehlte uns als erstes der Lift. Unser Gep√§ck wurde uns dann aufs Zimmer gebracht. 
Die Zimmer waren sauber und gepflegt, eher klein.
Jedoch war in der Nacht immer wieder der L√§rm der heimkommenden Nachtschw√§rmer lautstark zu h√∂ren, die einander begr√ºssten oder die T√ºren zu fallen liessen. Der Boden knarrte bei jeder Person die an unserer Zimmert√ºr vorbei musste. ""Ringh√∂rig"" ist nur das Vorwort!!
Das Hotel hat Charme auf den ersten Blick und f√ºr zwei N√§chte war es ok aber nimmer 4 Sterne. 
Fr√ºhst√ºck war ok aber auf unserer Reise durch Irland hatten wir weniger Sterne Hotels mit reichhaltigerem Fr√ºhst√ºck.

219,Chic und irgendwie charming,"Bis auf ein kleines Missverst√§ndnis dar√ºber, dass Halbpension ein gratis Abendessen bedeutet ;-), war der Aufenthalt absolut ausgezeichnet. Es gab ein Zimmer-Upgrade, so dass wir auf den oberen Etagen zur ruhigen Seitenstra√üe geschlafen haben (Zimmergr√∂√üe f√ºr 2 Personen und Stadthotel absolut ausreichend). Dadurch h√∂rte man vom doch recht lauten Verkehr der Amiens Street inklusive des Rappelns der Z√ºge der Connolly Station √ºberhaupt nichts. Das Hotel ist von der Einrichtung her geschmackvoll, altmodischer Charme (Fackeltr√§ger am Eingang, die Sofas und Sessel im Loungebereich) get√ºncht mit modernem Glamour (zugegeben: Farbkombi z.B. pink und gr√ºn muss man m√∂gen, ich fand es klasse). Ich hatte immer den Gedanken: Wenn Oscar Wilde noch leben w√ºrde, er h√§tte sich bestimmt in diesem flamboyanten Ambiente wohl gef√ºhlt. Personal: Sehr freundlich. Insbesondere der Hotelmanager hat sich um uns bem√ºht, immer wieder nach dem Befinden erkundigt und ob er irgendetwas f√ºr uns tun kann (er bedient im Restaurant √ºbrigens auch selbst). Fr√ºhst√ºck - nur kontinental nehmen, Kaffee oder Tee, Toast, leckeres Soda Bread, Marmelade, M√ºsliallerlei, Pfannkuchenmaschinchen, vier unterschiedliche S√§fte (Irish Breakfast muss man der Typ f√ºr sein, ich kriege fette W√ºrste und Speck einfach nicht runter).  
Von der Lage her ein toller Startpunkt f√ºr Stadttouren (√ºber die Talbot Street ist man in einer Viertel Stunde zu Fu√ü auf der O'Connell Street, auf der H√∂he des Spire und der James-Joyce-Statue), Z√ºge, Busse und Stra√üenbahn gleich nebenan bzw. auf der anderen Stra√üenseite.",5,2015,04,06

El desayuno era correcto, siempre surtido y con amplia variedad de comida.
La habitaci√≥n que nos toc√≥ era una habitaci√≥n muy amplia, con vistas a la calle, pero con unas cortinas que no tapaban en absoluto la luz de la calle y unas ventanas viejas que dejaban pasar todo el ruido.

219,..weekend in famiglia!,"Siamo partiti alla volta di Dublino in 6 persone (l'hotel ci √® stato prenotato da un'agenzia di viaggi), ma ci siamo trovati subito bene.

La colazione √® ben fornita, sia quella irlandese, sia quella internazionale ( certo...manca la nutella, ma per gli amanti della colazione all'italiana ci sono Th√®,latte caldo con cacao, caff√® e cornetti).

Es ist empfohlen die renovierten Zimmer im hinteren Teil des Hotels zu buchen. 

Die zur Bahn zugewandten Zimmer sind sehr laut und etwas abgewohnt.

A parte questo, l'hotel √® in buona posizione, pulito, personale molto cordiale e aggiungo che dispone di parcheggio interno assolutamente molto comodo.
Colazione nella media, se si vuole la Full Irish Breakfast bisogna pagare un supplemento (non √® bello per√≤ sentirsi dire, visto che di base ci √® stata inclusa la Continental Breakfast, che dal buffet si pu√≤ prendere tutto tranne le pietanze calde....!!!!)

219,Bien situado pero caro- Convenient Location but too expensive,"Pasamos 3 noches en este hotel, dos a la llegada a Irlanda y otra antes de irnos. Por lo tanto estuvimos en dos habitaciones diferentes. Las dos habitaciones eran preciosas y estaban muy limpias. El √∫nico problema es que pegado al hotel hay un puente por el que pasa el tren y a partir de las 6 de la ma√±ana es imposible dormir porque pasa un tren cada 10 minutos.Por esta raz√≥n me parece que el hotel es caro porque pierde calidad al tener el puente pegado literalmente a la fachada, tan pegado que hay momento que tiembla todo.
 En general, el personal del hotel es muy amable. Salvo un chica en recepci√≥n que parec√≠a haberse tragado un tenedor y otra en el comedor de desayunos que no pon√≠a muy buena cara cuando le ped√≠as algo. Por cierto, los desayunos eran buen√≠simos. Eran de buffet y con las cosas t√≠picas de los desayunos irlandeses, ademas de fruta, zumos, tostadas, cereales y si tenias suerte boller√≠a. 
La situaci√≥n del hotel es muy buena. A 5 minutos del rio Liffey, a 15 minutos por la calle Talbot de la calle O'Connell y de la zona de tiendas y a 20 minutos de la zona de pubs Temple Bar.
Para nosotros, a pesar del tren, es un hotel que recomendar√≠amos sin dudarlo.

We stayed here 3 nights; two at the arrivel at Irland and other one before leaving, so we were in two different rooms. Both were very beautiful, comfortable, charming and clean. The only problem is the train bridge that is almost attached to the hotel. From 6 am it is impossible to sleep because a train passes every 10 minutes.  That's why we think it's too expensive. 
The staff is in general very friendly, except for a woman in the reception desk and another one in the breakfast room. 
By the way, breakfast was great. You can eat everything you want. There are cereals and toasts, the Irish traditional breakfast, juices, fruit, and if you are lucky some pastries.
The location is nice. Next to the river, you can get walking to O'Connell Street and shops area (15 minutes) and to the Temple bar area (20 minutos)
Despite the train, I highly recommend it.",4,2014,10,04

Le note a sfavore sono sostanzialmente due: le camere sono molto rumorose, sia se si √® sulla strada, vicino alla ferrovia o se siete vicino alla porta tagliafuoco che sbatte vigorosamente ad ogni passaggio.
La seconda √® che, lamento per il primo piano, non esiste ascensore. poco importa se avete trent'anni, un forzuto marito o un bagaglio minimo, ma se avete un mega valigiozzo e settant'anni, il particolare incide.",3,2014,09,14

Andere hatten nicht das Gl√ºck. 
Einige Zimmer gehen Richtung Bahn Linie da hat man das Gef√ºhl es f√§hrt der Zug mitten durchs Zimmer.
Keine lade und Park M√∂glichkeit f√ºr Busse
Das muss auf der viel befahrenen Stra√üe geschehen.
Fahrer Achtung es werden auf der Stra√üe Blitz schnell Taschen aus Fahrzeugen 
gestohlen w√§hrend des Ausladen. T√ºren zu lassen",2,2014,06,22
219,Ferien 6 Tage,"Alles tiptop, saubere Zimmer, Personal freundlich. 
Zu Fuss ins Zentrum 10minuten, Bus in der N√§he. Beim Hotel rechts befindet sich ein Spar der sehr lange offen hat.

Anmerkung: im Standard-Zimmer keine Minibar, nur Tee-und Kaffeebeutel zur Verf√ºgung, Wasser nicht vorhanden.",4,2014,06,19
219,sobrevivir una noche,"Hotel muy antiguo situado en una zona muy c√©ntrica.Si quiere simplemente pasar una noche
( y no muy buena) elija este caser√≥n de fondo interminable con escaleras interpuestas,puertas de paso en medio de los pasillos con tarjeta magn√©tica,ascensores que salen de la planta primera,sal√≥n de desayunos en un s√≥tano mal iluminado y sin ventilaci√≥n,decoraci√≥n de pacotilla y recepci√≥n a medio metro de la entrada y sin sitio para las maletas.Eso s√≠,la cafeter√≠a para uso desde la calle invita a tomar una pinta aunque, luego, ya dentro, el comedor principal en tonos marrones y negros propios de una pel√≠cula de terror invite a  marcharse.
No entiendo la f√≥rmula de este hotel pues parece vivir de las apariencias con su vest√≠bulo ""vintage"" y desplomarse en todo lo dem√°s cuando traspasas los metros que te separan del resto del las zonas,llenas de escaleras y pasillos que salen a zonas privadas ,puertas que se cierran con tarjeta,ascensores que salen de plantas sitios imposibles y trampas para los usuarios (escaleras,descansillos,recovecos,zonas en alquiler,lounges para residentes..)
La habitaci√≥n peque√±a, con moqueta y mobiliario tosco es deprimente.El ba√±o es peque√±o,con sanitarios anticuados.El grifo que grad√∫a el agua y la temperatura de la ducha puede pasar de 2 a 80 grados simplemente con un giro; la posici√≥n √∫nica aceptable es ""a y 22 minutos""..tal como adjunto en la foto.
Desde mi ventana se ve la v√≠a del ferrocarril (o tranv√≠a) aunque el ruido no se apreciaba.
Finalmente el desayuno es escaso y pobre.
Eso s√≠, funcionaba el wi-fi .",2,2014,06,09
219,Buon hotel ma...,"L'hotel √© indubbiamente un buon hotel, pi√π indirizzato a clientela d'affari e gruppi, √© pulito, lo staff gentile e disponibile e la location √© a 5 minuti da O Connell street quindi vicino al centro.
Alcuni dettagli potrebbero essere migliori, come la colazione di qualit√† media e in una sala un p√≥ claustrofobica cos√¨ come il fitness center. L'hotel ha inoltre una logistica un p√≤ complessa, √© un piccolo labirinto ma con pazienza ci si orienta. Altro elemento da tenere presente √© la frequentazione della zona nelle ore notturne, intorno all'hotel infatti girano persone poco raccomandabili, fate attenzione.",3,2014,05,23
219,Decepcionante,"Mucho ruido en la habitaci√≥n, las ca√±er√≠as de la calefacci√≥n eran muy ruidosas y casi no te dejaban dormir. La habitaci√≥n pegada a las v√≠as del tren, otros ruidos a√±adidos. Para ir a la habitaci√≥n no hab√≠a ascensor y tuvimos que subir 3 escaleras diferentes y recorrer 3 o 4 corredores y abrir puertas (con tarjeta de la habitaci√≥n). Todo muy c√≥modo para subir con tres maletas cargando!! No volver√≠a a ir ni que me regalaran la habitaci√≥n. Ah! Y la reserva era de un mes antes.
Adem√°s el suelo de la habitaci√≥n no estaba nivelado y se inclinaba en algunas partes.
La habitaci√≥n era bonita, pero no estaba a la altura de lo esperado, por todos los inconvenientes detallados!",1,2014,05,11
219,Con piccoli accorgimenti potrebbe diventare un ottimo hotel!,"Centralissimo, distante un paio di isolati da O'Connel street, il vivacissimo viale in cui si fermano molti autobus (inclusi quelli provenienti dall'aeroporto). In ogni caso l'hotel al costo di 5‚Ç¨ a persona per singola corsa mette a disposizione uno shuttle da e per l'aeroporto, chiedete gli orari!La nostra camera al 7¬∞ piano  era silenziosa, molto pulita e confortevole. Con bollitore, tazze, caff√®, th√® e zucchero, ha reso meno amara la mancanza di un frigobar. Il phon si trovava nel cassetto e nell'armadio era presente il ferro da stiro e l'asse. I letti erano comodi, ma con i piumini incorporati nelle lenzuola, per cui di notte abbiamo patito il caldo! Il condizionatore non funzionava, ecco questa era l'unica nota dolente. In zona si trovano pub, supermercati e negozi di souvenir. Il centro della movida √® raggiungibilissimo a piedi. Ci ritornerei.",4,2014,05,05
219,Buena ubicaci√≥n y servicio,"Situado muy cerca de la parada del bus 747 del aeropuerto y enfrente del tranv√≠a. C√©ntrico, a escasos minutos andando de O'Connell Street. La atenci√≥n del personal muy buena y la habitaci√≥n muy amplia, con todo lo necesario y muy buena limpieza. La √∫nica pega los portazos que hab√≠a que dar para cerrar las puertas, con el ruido que ello supon√≠a. El desayuno bastante completo, irland√©s, pan tostado, cereales, yogures, fruta, ... Escaso en dulces. Pagamos algo menos de 80‚Ç¨ la noche por habitaci√≥n doble (que en realidad ten√≠a tres camas)",4,2014,04,07
219,Tutto come volevo!!,"Questo hotel mi √® stato scelto dall'agenzia, e devo dire che la scelta √® stata perfetta! 5 gg in questo Hotel ubicato difronte la stazione e a max 20 min a piedi da Grafton St. e Temple Bar. La hall forse non colpisce per le moquettes molto scure, ma la amera mi ha soddisfatta in pieno: solare, arredamento moderno, soprattutto PULITISSIMA (come, del resto, ogni punto dell'hotel): la prova?? Io sono allergica e, a causa delle moquettes che , nei paesi anglosassoni, sono ovunque , ho sempre problemi, eppure....non ho starnutito una volta!! Le camere,anche se accanto alla stazione, sono silenziosissime (unica cosa: se state al primo piano, attenzione che affacciano su strada e si vede tutto). Il letto e cuscini ampi e comodi
La colazione √® varia ed √® di ottima qualit√† in ogni componente (ho provato tutto, quindi ne sono certa!).
Il personale professionale e cordiale e ti fornisce suggerimenti e spiegazioni; 
Cosa utilissima √® il transfer che organizzano per 5 EURO a persona con uno shuttle( se prenotate , potete chiedere il transfer con lo shuttle anche al vs arrivo: io nn lo sapevo e ho pagato il taxi 25 euro). Unica attenzione: lo shuttle compie un bel giro e vi ferma in un corridoio che dista 5 minuti a piedi per i terminal: siate attenti a prenotare un orario abbastanza anticipato rispetto alla partenza perch√® tra questo e i molti minuti che per i controlli all'aeroporto di Dublino devi perdere, pu√≤ essere ""pericoloso"" arrivare troppo stretti di orario.
Insomma , quando ritorner√≤ a Dublino, ritorner√≤ in questo hotel !! Anche per il rapporto qualit√†/prezzo
p.s.: gli asciugacapelli si trovano nei cassetti, non √® vero che non ce ne sono nelle camere...",5,2014,04,05
219,Gediegenes Hotel mit mangelhaftem Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis,"Wir waren am St. Patrick's Day Wochenende 2013 in Dublin und verbrachten 3 N√§chte im North Star Hotel.

Das Hotel war nicht g√ºnstig, auch wenn man den Fakt, dass es das St. Patrick's Day Wochenende war und Hotels auf den Britischen Inseln etwas teurer als in Deutschland sind, in Betracht zieht.
Der Lobbybereich machte einen gediegenen Eindruck. Das Personal erf√ºllte seinen Job beim Einchecken zur Zufriedenheit.
Wir hatten ein Premier Club Room gebucht, der von der Gr√∂√üe in Ordnung und sauber war. Alles in allem war der Aufenthalt ok und h√§tte drei Punkte verdient. 
Unsere Freunde hatten jedoch ein Standardzimmer gebucht und waren im Erdgeschoss untergebracht. Im Gang roch es seltsam nach Farbe. Das Zimmer war nicht richtig sauber und machte einen verlebten Gesamteindruck mit einem Bad, dass dringend eine Renovierung ben√∂tigt.

Abschlie√üend k√∂nnen wir sagen, dass der Aufenthalt in Ordnung ging, man jedoch wesentlich bessere Aufenthaltsm√∂glichkeiten in Dublin finden kann.",2,2014,01,29
219,Hotel abbastanza buono,"Nel complesso l'albergo √® molto buono, la stanza doppia che abbiamo prenotato era come in fotografia, il bagno era giusto tranne la doccia dove l'acqua calda usciva dopo che, praticamente, ti eri fatto la doccia con l'acqua fredda. La stanza si affacciava sulla ferrovia e dovevi chiudere le tende per non farti vedere dai passeggeri dei treni in transito (che viaggiavano abbastanza lenti!). Colazione abbondante. Il personale molto disponibile tranne il receptionist che abbiamo trovato al momento del check out (alle 4 di notte) che prima ci ha voluto far pagare l'adattatore che avevamo chiesto in prestito al momento del nostro arrivo (la signorina con cui parlammo al momento del check in, ""Maria"", ci disse che se lo volevamo in prestito non avremmo dovuto pagarlo, altrimenti, al costo di ‚Ç¨ 5, potevamo acquistarlo), in seguito ci ha fatto pagare ‚Ç¨ 10 per il servizio di trasporto con pullman dall'albergo all'aereoporto, quando all'inizio ci disse che era gratuito... mah! L'importante √® esser arrivati in aereoporto!",4,2014,01,19
219,Hotel di buona qualit√†,"Premetto. Il mio lavoro √®: ""accompagnatore turistico"". Viaggiare con turisti √® il mio lavoro e quindi mi permetto di dare giudizi esclusivamente ""oggettivi"" tenendo sempre presente il Paese visitato e il costo della struttura dove si soggiorna. 
1 - questo hotel di 4 stelle lo classifico un buon 3 stelle superiore per quanto riguarda le stanze. Spaziose, confortevoli e molto pulite. 2 - colazione e cena al ristorante di buona qualit√†. 3 - posizione rispetto al centro citt√†: buona; 25 minuti a piedi da Temple Bar (nelle citt√† 25 minuti significa essere in centro) usciti dall'hotel tenere a dx x 15 minuti e arrivate allo Spire su O'connol's Street (viale comodo e ampio con molti negozi), poi a sx e 10 minuti siete oltre il fiume e quindi in centro. Lo ritenete distante? bene allora con 8 euro a taxi siete in Temple Bar. 3 - hotel che sta difronte alla stazione Fs e Dart (i treni io non li ho sentiti, forse la posizione della mia stanza era favorevole e quindi non giudico) . Ho soggiornato 4 giorni agli inizi di dicembre 2013 con un gruppo di 28 persone (coppie, amici, junior e senior quindi un bel mix) e tutti sono rimasti MOLTO soddisfatti dell'hotel. buon mix qualit√†/prezzo e posizione.

P.S. ho assistito a scene dove c'erano italiani che si lamentavano. Loro erano il problema non ""L'HOTEL"". siate viaggiatori e non turisti quando girate il mondo e se volete mangiare come in Italia rimanete in Italia.",4,2014,01,19
219,Aussen Pfui-innen Hui!!!,"Von au√üen machte das Hotel einen sehr d√ºsteren Eindruck, von innen war es super! Die Halle mit der Rezeption noch viktorianisch gem√ºtlich, dann wurde es immer moderner. Einziger Wehrmutstropfen: der Aufzug ist nur durch eine Treppe erreichbar-mit Gep√§ck etwas schwierig.
Die Zimmer sind modernisiert worden und sehr bequem! 
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck wird leider in einem fensterlosen Kellerraum serviert. Der Raum selbst ist zwar sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet, macht aber das fehlende Tageslich nicht wett.
Dabei gibt es einen wunderbaren Pub im Hotel-mit Biergarten, in dem man rauchen darf!
Das Personal war extrem freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit.
Die Umgebung ist nicht die beste, aber daf√ºr relativ zentral. Der Flughafenbus h√§lt um die Ecke, einer der beiden Hauptbahnh√∂fe  ( Connolly Station ) - mit Anbindung Richtung S√ºden -befindet sich direkt vor dem Hotel. Das City Center von Dublin mit Trinity College, Temple Bar etc ist ca. 10 Minuten zu Fu√ü entfernt.",5,2014,01,15
219,Grata sorpresa,"El hotel ha sido una grata sorpresa para nosotros.El desayuno, surtido y variado, la situaci√≥n perfecta, frente a la estaci√≥n de buses y trenes.Con parada de bus directo al aeropuerto y a 15min caminando del centro.La atenci√≥n del hotel muy buena..sin duda lo recomendaremos a nuestros familiares y amigos",5,2014,01,11
219,Medio,"North star hotel Ireland. Mica tanto centrale
Hotel caratteristico stile irlandese, particolarmente accogliente con gli addobbi natalizi, ottimo il pub ristorante, buona la colazione, prevalentemente salata, deludenti le camere dell'ala vecchia, quelle del primo piano, certamente non corrispondenti ad un quattro stelle. La nostra stanza era la numero 165. Si √® sentita la mancanza dell'asciugacapelli. Il treno passa vicino ma non d√† fastidio. Forse sono migliori le stanze del piano ristrutturato. Ma l'atmosfera del primo piano, anche se un po' decadente, aiuta ad entrare nello spirito autentico irlandese. Il centro della citt√† si raggiunge a piedi faticosamente, ma davanti all'hotel ci sono sempre i taxi. Il pub/Ristorante annesso √® ottimo, da provare, mai deludente.",3,2014,01,07
219,√öltimos d√≠as de relax del a√±o,"Hotel bien situado. Habitaciones muy espaciosas y con todo lo necesario para que la estancia
en el hotel sea agradable. Estuvimos 3 noches.
La sala del desayuno era incre√≠blemente original, esta decorada con libros por las paredes. La sensaci√≥n es como estar en una tertulia literaria. Muy c√≥modos los asientos. La atenci√≥n del personal es muy atenta.
A pesar de que tuvimos problemas por la reserva de la habitaci√≥n (ajena al hotel), el personal fue muy amable y nos resolvi√≥ la situaci√≥n. Fue un poco complicado por el idioma, pero r√°pido consiguieron que nos lo explicara un empleado que hablaba espa√±ol. Si pasais por Dublin es muy recomendable este hotel",4,2013,12,18
219,Altamente recomendable,"Es uno de esos hoteles que te deja buen sabor de boca .La situaci√≥n es muy buena estando muy cerca del centro de la ciudad. No es necesario coger transporte p√∫blico. A pie se llega en un momento. El hotel est√° reformado y se observa que lo miman constantemente. Bonita y moderna decoraci√≥n. Ofrece todo tipo de servicios (incluyendo free wifi) y el trato del personal es muy bueno. A nosotros nos hizo el check in Maria y fue muy amable y atenta con nosotros. Tuvimos un par de problemas con la habitaci√≥n el mismo d√≠a de entrar, uno de ellos es que nuestra puerta no cerraba bien, por lo visto por falta de bater√≠a y r√°pidamente nos lo solucionaron. Despu√©s, descubrimos que la calefacci√≥n (aire caliente) de nuestra habitaci√≥n no funcionaba correctamente, hacia demasiado ruido al ponerlo en marcha y no llegaba a calentar, desprendiendo adem√°s  un olor desagradable (como a tabaco) , tuvimos que bajar a Recepci√≥n a comentarlo y recibimos una reacci√≥n muy buena por parte del equipo del hotel. A pesar de que ya era muy tarde. Fue el mismo Jefe de Recepci√≥n el que subi√≥ a nuestra habitaci√≥n para comprobar lo que estaba sucediendo con el aire y nos ofreci√≥ un cambio de habitaci√≥n. La verdad que genial, ya que la habitaci√≥n nueva era de categor√≠a superior. As√≠ que ah√≠ nos quedamos para toda la estancia ( 5 noches) y ya no tuvimos ning√∫n problema m√°s. Destaco otro punto bueno del hotel en cuanto al servicio de desayuno: Nosotros ten√≠amos el desayuno incluido para todas las ma√±anas pero una de ellas deb√≠amos de salir del hotel antes de las 7h ( que es cuando abre el restaurante) para una excursi√≥n que hab√≠amos contratado, as√≠ que la soluci√≥n por parte del hotel fue llevarnos el desayuno a la habitaci√≥n ( desayuno continental en lugar del desayuno completo que nosotros hab√≠amos contratado sin cobrarnos ning√∫n extra de Room Service) a la hora que nosotros quisi√©ramos, as√≠ que lo solicitamos para las 6 de la ma√±ana y as√≠ fue. Todo perfecto. Como dec√≠a, un servicio muy bueno. Si vuelvo a Dubl√≠n sin duda volver√© al hotel.",5,2013,12,03
219,Mucho mejor de lo que pensaba.,"Estuvimos 4 dias de vacaciones en Dublin y nos alojamos en este hotel, todo magnifico.
La habitacion grande, las camas comodas para decansar despues de unas pintas por la ciudad.
el desayuno un 10n tienes de todo sin problema y de calidad.
La situacion perfecta, a pocos minutos del centro y ademas el paseo es por una calle comercial llena de tiendas y bares de todo tipo,genial!!!.
Volveremos a Dublin y por supuesto a este hotel.",5,2013,12,02
219,Ottimo...Pulito e Centrale,"Ottima scelta, aiutati da una coppia di amici che gi√† c'erano stati...abbiamo trascorso un weekend ottimo!Hotel centrale, pulito e tutti molto cordiali.
Alla prossima...ah un piccolo appunto per chi dovesse venire con bimbi piccoli, come noi, dopo le 21 non li fanno pi√π entrare in nessun locale (Pub o simili).",5,2013,11,17
219,Ambisce alle 4 stelle..ma c'√® molto da rifare!,"L'ho scelto per le splendide foto ...MA ancora non sapevo che si trattava delle superior (che per√≤ non mi han nemmeno proposto per un upgrade): ci son altri 2 design di camera. (a me √® capitato quello che mi piaceva di meno)
L'ho scelto anche per la posizione...ma ho finito per camminare a piedi tantissimo comunque (nonostante l'abbonamento).
In compenso non √® difficile n√® troppo lungo arrivare a the Spire..e nemmeno raggiungere i locali di temple bar
Quando ti danno la chiave elettronica..vedi 4 stelle...ma gia' quando arrivi..la hall √® triste...la scala NON √® perfetta (e senza ascensore per arrivare al primo piano!!!)
In compenso il personale √® stato squisitamente gentile e servizievole
check in e out veloce, deposito bagagli con contromarca e senza pagamento
Ma appena si percorre il lungo corridoio per accedere a un blocco di stanze..guardo inorridita le poltrone di velluto unte e sporche: MA non facevan meglio a levarle? o a metter un copricuscini???
C'√® anche una sala di riposo..dalle tinte scure..poca luce..e con nessuno nei paraggi
poi si accede a una porta con serratura elettronica
(ce n'√® un'altra all'ultimo piano riservata a i clienti premier e con privilegi)
SI passa anche da una seconda reception..la cui funzione mi √® ignota (per qualsiasi cosa mi han rispedito ai piani bassi)
quindi si arriva agli ascensori e poi alla stanza.
Trovo la finestra aperta (e la ritrover√≤ anche dopo il rifacimento della stanza: √® ottobre..potevan evitarlo!): in compenso non ho problemi di temperatura
Le cosa che mi fan pessima impressione sono 2:
una macchia nera e unta sui tendoni
le piastrelle intorno al bagno.. malmesse e con le fughe color scuro
Non posso dire che la stanza non sia pulita..MA non √® come me l'aspettavo
DI sicuro non mancano i cuscini, molto carini, in abbondanza, e di velluto verde
Il letto..come speravo (dopo le altre recensioni) √® comodo , la stanza √® medio-grande
Fortunatamente NON ho sentito particolari problemi di rumore relativo al treno (√® capitato una volta sola ..al piano dell'ascensore)
utilissima la cassaforte e la kettle
troppo piccolo l'asciugamano da bagno !!!
Il fon necessita di abilitare  l'interruttore della spina (provatele tutte..anche non quella direttamente sopra)
comodissima la fermata dell'airshuttle 747 a 5'  a piedi (andata , al ritorno √® al busaras), 
per arrivare in hotel cercare il piccolo supermercato Spar (caro, non serve nemmeno per l'H2O)
√® davanti alla stazione dei treni, della luas e ci son vari bus (anche notturni)
√® quindi comodo per spostarsi nell'asse est ovest
Mi son sentita sicura anche la sera
a 2 minuti c'√® anche un convenientissimo internet e call center
Colazione estremamente deludente, non nella quantita' (abbondante) ma nella qualita' (mediocre..dalle marmellate ..ai salumi..ai due tipi di formaggi...)
Se non compresa consiglio di NON prendere la colazione
colazione al piano piu' basso (i numeri sull'ascensore sono illogici, una targhetta con HALL sarebbe utile!)
Data la qualita' della colazione ho evitato il ristorante
La palestra era ben attrezzata...mentre la sauna NON ho capito dove fosse (forse all'interno degli spogliatoi??): d'altronde non era una mia priorita'.
la cosa che colpisce di piu' √® l'aspetto triste della hall: dovrebbero rifare almeno la moquette (e alcune poltrone): con pochi tocchi gia' migliorerebbe di parecchio
Ho scelto con molta cura questo hotel...una volta era famoso..ma non ha l'allure che ne fa un luogo di fascino
Il rapporto qualita' /prezzo per me √® stato abbastanza buono
ma non so se ci ritornerei
suggerisco di dotarsi di un'ascensore! a fine giornata anche un sol piano di scale mi √® stato pesante (anche sul retro)",3,2013,11,11
219,Ideal f√ºr einen St√§dtetrip,"Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen.

219,AL CENTRO DELLA CITY,"Camera a piano terra e allocata nel corpo dietro all'hotel, accessibile mediante una tettoia tra i due edifici. La camera pulita, comoda e con bagno sufficientemente spazioso, dotata di finestra con apertura a vasistason bollitore per caff√® o the, ottime asciugamani e set bagno. Unica cosa mancante il frigobar. La sera √® bene tenere la finestra chiusa al fine di evitare il rumore del passaggio dei treni (praticamente quasi sopra al corpo principale dell'hotel). L'albergo si trova a circa 300 metri dal centro Connell St. e di fronte alla stazione dei treni Connelly Station (molto comoda per l'utilizzo della DART che vi porta alla penisola di Worth e/o Malahide: consiglio queste due escursioni che fatte da voi stessi vi permette di essere svincolati da gruppi e si ci arriva con soli 2,80 euro a tratta. Vicinissimo all'hotel si trovano bar per la prima colazione con 5,80 euro (colazione irlandese). Il bus da/per l'aereoporto √® vicinissimo all'hotel circa 2 minuti a piedi: stazione Baseras. Inoltre l'albergo offre su richiesta a 5,00 euro a persona e a tratta il trasferimento dall'aereoporto/hotel/aereoporto. Hotel consigliatissimo.",4,2013,10,14

219,"albergo buono, personale un p√≤ meno","Siamo andati a dublino per vedere il match di rugby Irlanda - Italia del marzo 2012 ed abbiamo scelto questo albergo per il prezzo contenuto e la vicinanza al centro di dublino, temple bar sta a pi√π o meno 10/15 minuti a piedi.
L'albergo e pulito e moderno, le stanze economiche sono piccoline, ma per il prezzo e l'uso andavano pi√π che bene. c'√® un pub interno con posti all'aperto. ed √® vicino alla ferrovia, anche troppo, i passeggeri dei treni potevano vederci direttamente nella camera.
La nota dolente √® stata il personale: ho fatto recapitare i biglietti della partita direttamente in albergo, a nome della persona che ha fatto la prenotazione delle camere, ma di questi biglietti non c'era traccia. li ho chiesti pi√π volte, e credo mi abbiano capito, ma mi dicevano che i biglietti non erano ancora arrivati; il giorno della partita un signore della consierge chiama il servizio clienti del sito sui cui avevo acquistato i biglietti e ho sentito uno spiacevolissimo ""we have 4 italians very limited in english"" se lo poteva risparmiare, inoltre i ticket erano arrivati prima di noi e li aveva ricevuti un tizio che tra l'altro ci ha accreditato 10 euro di traffico internet, perch√© un mio amico si era seduto davanti al PC della sala comune 5 minuti di orologio.
Capisco di non essere una macina in inglese, ma per me i biglietti li volevano far sparire.
quindi eccezione fatta per il personale, il resto √® ok.",3,2013,09,27
219,una sorpresa agradable,"Estuvimos alojados una noche, y no puedo decir nada malo del lugar.

219,Perfecto,"Nos alojamos 3 noches en este hotel este mes de Agosto. Llegamos y no nos costo nada encontrarlo.Frente a la estaci√≥n de tren Conolly y a 50 metros de Busaras, la estacion de buses.  
 Nos atendieron y asignaron r√°pidamente la habitaci√≥n, 7¬™ planta , habitaci√≥n premier club...Una maravilla!!!muy grande, cama king, terraza, television de unas 40¬¥¬¥, armario con plancha y tabla de planchar, estupendo secador de pelo, ba√±o de m√°rmol precioso...La decoraci√≥n moderna, muebles oscuros y colores √°cidos para la sobrecama, Por cierto cama comodisima, almohadas de plum√≥n...Todo muy nuevo...Un 10!! El √∫nico inconveniente, que el wifi estaba incluido en esa habitaci√≥n pero no funcionaba..Una pena.

 La ubicaci√≥n del hotel esta muy bien, a 10 minutos del centro, y temple bar. Puedes recorrerte la ciudad andando sin problema desde el Hotel. 
 El desayuno continental algo pobre..Nada de embutido y solo tostadas y cereales, eso si de muchas clases, eche de menos algo de boller√≠a y fruta...
  Tambi√©n por 5 euros por persona tienen servicio de shuttle al aeropuerto, y es muy c√≥modo ya que no tienes que ir con las maletas al bus de linea..
 100% recomendable, la relaci√≥n calidad precio es fabulosa",4,2013,09,02
219,Wer wirklich Luxus erwartet ist hier fehl am Platz,"Wir haben 3 N√§chte in einem der Premiumzimmer verbracht! An sich waren die Zimmer ganz sch√∂n! Das Bett war der Hammer! Leider ist es wie fast √ºberall in Irland..es wird einmal ordentlich renoviert/ neu gemacht und das war es dann. Die Fliesen im Vorraum waren so gut wie alle lose, kleine Macken in den Regalen werden ignoriert. Kurz gesagt, das Zimmer war abgewohnt! Der Check-In war auch nicht so prickelnd, keinerlei Informationen, au√üer wie man zum Zimmer gelangt! 
(Continental)Breakfast war super, sehr nettes Personal!
Die Lage ist perfekt, direkt an der Conolly Station! Dart, Commuter, Luas-alles sofort zu erreichen! Dadurch ist es aber auch ziemlich laut in den Zimmern! Die Premiumzimmer (Aufschlag in der Regel von 30 Euro) hatten gl√ºcklicherweise eine Klimaanlage!
Wir haben uns f√ºr den Preis und daf√ºr was versprochen wurde einfach mehr erhofft! Da muss echt mehr her! Und unsere Anspr√ºche sind nicht √ºberm√§√üig hoch! Weiterempfehlen w√ºrde ich es leider nicht!",3,2013,08,29
219,Ottimo Hotel per visitare Dublino,"Ciao a Tutti,
per me Dublino √® una delle citt√† pi√π belle d'europa, mi piace la gente, il modo di vivere e devo dire la verit√† mi √® piaciuto molto soggiornare in questo hotel.
L'hotel si raggiunge comodamente con un bus che √® all'uscita dell'aereoporto e che ferma nelle vicinanze (bisogna camminare solo 150 metri circa a piedi).
E' situato in una buona posizione per visitare tutta la citt√†.
La camera nella quale abbiamo soggiornato io e la mia fidanzata era molto comoda e confortevoli.
Assolutamente consigliato, ottimo paragone qualit√†/prezzo.",4,2013,08,16
219,Hotel sopra le aspettative,"Buon hotel in zona tranquilla e centrale, vicinissima a tutti i sistemi di trasporto (tram, treno, treno suburbano, bus e bus per aereoporto). Costituito da due edfici, ho pernottato in quello pi√π antico, completamente restaurato anche con gusto. Unico difetto mancanza di aria condizionata e ascensore (grave per le valige e la vetustit√† della scale in legno non proprio ideali da percorrere con un bagalio pesante). Comunque valutazione altamente positiva, personale cordiale. Da direttamente sulla strada ma le finestre sono insonorizzate. Stanza ampia con grande bagno. Un altro piccolo difetto √® la presenza di un viadotto ferroviario a ridosso dell'hotel. Rumore diretto poco, pi√π che altro vibra tutto; preferibili le stanze pi√π lontante dal viadotto, ma con un bel paio di tappi per le orecchie (che consiglio sempre) tutto si riduce.",4,2013,08,07
219,Buena relaci√≥n calidad-precio y ubicaci√≥n,"El North Start Hotel es ese tipo de hotel en el que te alojar√≠as si quieres pagar un precio ajustado por dormir bien y sin sorpresas desagradables. Una de las mejores ventajas del mismo es su ubicaci√≥n. 

Se encuentra situado justo enfrente de Connolly Station, al lado de una calle comercial con supermercados y todo tipo de servicios (Talbot street), y a escasos 10 minutos de O'Connell street (una de las principales avenidas de Dubl√≠n).

En cuanto a las habitaciones, nosotros nos alojamos en una suite junior al acogernos a una oferta que ten√≠an que nos inclu√≠a el wifi y el desayuno. Lo cual hizo nuestra estancia muy agradable. Cuidado porque salvo esta oferta que disfrutamos, el Wifi es de pago y el desayuno tambi√©n.

La limpieza bastante buena, no es algo de lo que nos podamos quejar. Quiz√° lo √∫nico negativo es que la decoraci√≥n estaba un poco desfasada, un poco antigua pero no excesivamente. Si lo remodelaran ganar√≠a mucho.",4,2013,08,01
219,"Correcto, bien ubicado, trato agradable","Acabamos de estar en este hotel, muy bien ubicado, el personal es muy amable, la cama muy c√≥moda, es limpio, el desayuno correcto y el precio es bueno. Tambien tiene parking, cuesta 8 euros al dia y enfrente esta la estaci√≥n de tren, autobuses y tranv√≠a. Por la noche se puede tomar una copa en la terraza con m√∫sica agradable y aprovechar para conectarse a internet gratis, ya que en la habitaci√≥n cuesta unos 5 euros la hora. Volver√≠a a repetir.",4,2013,07,27
219,Comodo e carino,"Adoro Dublino e tutto ci√≤ che la riguarda, per questo ho deciso di passare un weekend in questa splendida citt√† che vive sia di giorno che di notte e un hotel molto vicino al centro come questo √® stato l'ideale per me! L'atmosfera √® accogliente, anche nel pub annesso all'hotel dove, una volta tornati da una lunga passeggiata nottura in centro ci si pu√≤ fermare per gustarsi una buona birra, nel perfetto spirito irlandese! Camere confortevoli e pulite, un p√≤ scomoda la doccia...√® vicino alla stazione dei treni, un p√≤ troppo per i miei gusti, tanto che ogni volta che passava un treno ballava tutto (quando sono andata non ci ho fatto quasi caso, adesso, da terremotata, non so se ci tornerei...); lo consiglio vivamente a chi vuole immergersi nella vita di Dublino, ne vale la pena!",4,2013,07,16
219,Vicino al centro,"Siamo stati in questo hotel qualche giorno perch√® quest'anno abbiamo deciso di passare il capodanno in Irlanda quindi abbiamo prenotato in anticipo io il mio compagno e un nostro amico.
L'hotel si raggiunge comodamente con un bus che √® all'uscita dell'aereoporto e che ferma nelle vicinanze.
L'hotel √® in una posizione comodissima per raggiungere il centro a piedi.
La camera √® abbastanza spaziosa come del resto il bagno.Il personale √® molto cortese e la stanza ben pulita. L'arredamento √® un p√≤ retr√≤ nella hall con le statue e la moquette. La stanza √® silenziosa. Unica cosa da segnalare che all'interno dell'hotel c'√® una piccola palestra e una sauna che per√≤ √® spenta. Se si vuole accedere alla sauna bisogna avvisare prima di modo che la accendono.
Noi non avevamo la colazione inclusa ma andavamo a farla fuori.",3,2013,06,07
219,Un buen hotel a un precio muy adecuado,"Estuvimos hace unos d√≠as y el hotel se ha transformado un poco desde la √∫ltima vez que estuve. Las habitaciones reformadas muy bien y el trato como siempre, extraordinario. El restaurante interesante.La recepci√≥n ya no est√° en el primer piso, lo que se agradece. Ahora es totalmente nueva y esta en la propia entrada. Espero que en la siguiente visita el resto de habitaciones est√© ya reformado. La ubicaci√≥n es muy buena.

219,Un hotel muy familiar y amigable,"Siempre que voy a Dubl√≠n me alojo en este hotel. No es demasiado caro, est√° bien ubicado, el bus del aeropuerto te deja al girar la esquina, tienes trenes y tranv√≠as en la puerta, el centro est√° a 15 minutos andando.
Adoro su desayuno irland√©s. 
no es el t√≠pico hotel que va cambiando de personal cada vez que vas, siempre ves las mismas personas tan amables.
Adem√°s lo est√°n reformando y est√° quedando muy bonito.
En el pub-restaurante te puedes tomar una giness o cenar en un entorno muy agradable.

219,Hotel stile irlandese,"Hotel simpatico , personale gentile , le camere non sono molto grandi ma neanche piccole , oltre al letto ed i comodini c'e' un piccolo studiolo utile se dovete usare il computer o scrivere , il bagno e' di grandezza normale , le camere erano pulite .
L'hotel si trova in una posizione comoda a raggiungere il centro a piedi in circa 20/30 minuti ma durante il tragitto ci sono diversi negozietti e bar per cui non vi accorgete nemmeno del tempo che ci mettete , ottimi i negozi di souvenir di Dublino con tante cose veramente simpatiche molto diverse dai soliti negozi di souvenir che trovate nelle altre citta' europee .
Se andate in aereo vi consiglio questo hotel",4,2012,12,08
219,lo consiglio!!!!,"Per le mie esigenze di viaggio √® un hotel perfetto. Io guardo soprattutto il rapporto qualit√† prezzo e questo √® imbattibile. Posizione centrale un po' defilata a est, esattamente tra il vero e proprio centro e la zona finanziaria, √® vicino alla stazione treni, tram e bus. L'hotel √® appena stato rimodernato e ""profuma"" di nuovo. Le camere sono spaziose, pulite e silenziose (almeno la nostra). L'hotel si trova proprio adiacente alla linea del tram quindi fate magari attenzione a richiedere una camera ""intelligente"". La wifi √® a pagamento ed √® cara, c'√® per√≤ un PC con internet gratis nella lobby per gli ospiti. Sotto all'hotel si trovano un ristorante e un bel bar.",5,2012,12,04
219,Una tomadura de pelo.,"El hotel en si est√° bien situado, pero tiene una parte que es el priomer mundo, y otra que es el subdesarrollo. La primera noche nos llevaron a esa zona. Habitacion supervierja y sucia, tipica del siglo XIX. La puerta rota, agujeros en las paredes, ara√±as en el ba√±o. Y ubicada bajo los arcos de ujn puente donde cada 5 o 19 minutos pasa un tren. Reclamamos, y tras discutir y discutir; conseguimos que nos cambiasen a la otra zona; y fue como pasar de la noche al d√≠a. Vamos, nada que ver. Habitaciones amplias, limpias, espaciosas, y soleadas durante el d√≠a.  Un pesimo trato por parte del personal del hotel, y la direccion que qujiso colarnos un gol por toda kla escuadra. Una pena, porque la ubicacion del hotel es excelente, y el desayuno inmejorable, pero gtars esta p√±esima experiencia, no puedo darle una buena calificaci√≥n.",3,2012,11,30
219,Zu laut -das Geld nicht wert,"Ich hatte ein Zimmer, von welchem man direkt auf die Stra√üe und auf die Connolly Station sehen konnte. Es war unglaublich laut! Man konnte jedes einzelne Auto h√∂ren, die unz√§hligen Busse und vor allem die Z√ºge... Zudem befindet sich im Erdgeschoss des Hotels ein Pub. In diesem wird abends von Freitag bis Sonntag Live-Musik gespielt und zwar in einer Lautst√§rke, dass ich selbst im 1. Stock kein Auge zu tun konnte. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck eben typisch britisch/irisch (wer fetthaltige Ern√§hrung mag kommt auf seine Kosten). Das Personal ist recht freundlich und das Zimmer was sehr sauber. Insgesamt kann ich dieses Hotel aber nicht empfehlen. Es ist daf√ºr einfach viel zu teuer (ca. 70 ‚Ç¨/die Nacht und das war schon ein Angebot!)!!!",2,2012,11,13
219,Ci tornerei sicuramente!,"Siamo appena tornati da questa meravigliosa vacanza di 5 giorni trascorsa a Dublino e devo dire che ci siamo trovati benissimo. La camera era decisamente grande e pulita, il letto era comodissimo, tra i piu' comodi che mi sia mai capitato. Eravamo al 6' piano e, sebbene fossimo vicino alla stazione ferroviaria, il rumore era minimo e sopportabile. Il personale dell'albergo e' stato gentilissimo. Unici difetti: asciugamani molto piccoli, pagamento di 3 euro per il deposito valigie o per il collegamento a internet per soli 20 minuti. Inoltre, sconsiglio la colazione continentale a 7 euro piuttosto scarsina. Fuori si possono trovare locali dove mangiare meglio e a meno!!!
Posizione centrale e tranquilla. Lo consiglio sicuramente.",4,2012,11,02
219,Pi√π fumo che arrosto!!!,"Hotel collocato di fronte alla stazione ferroviaria, a pochi metri dalla fermata del tram e dal capolinea degli autobus, a circa 20 min. di taxi dall'aeroporto di Dublino e decisamente vicino al centro citt√† raggiungibile anche a piedi in 10 minuti o due fermate di tram.
L'impatto non √® gradevole, varcata la soglia della hall sembra di fare un salto indietro di almeno trent'anni, con la vecchia moquette che rende ancor meno accogliente l'ambiente retr√≤.
La reception √® altrettanto datata ma quel che √® peggio √® il percorso che conduce alle stanze: moquette vecchia, sporca e polverosa: da crisi asmatica.
Discorso diverso per le stanze: ampie, pulite, evidentemente rinnovate, con sala da bagno spaziosa e dotata di vasca; il pavimento, per√≤, cigola ovunque.
Inoltre, manca il frigobar e l'armadio √® decisamente piccolo. Confermo che il phon √® occultato nel cassetto della scrivania.
Nessun problema di rumorosit√† delle stanze in relazione alla vicina stazione.
Le finestre chiuse abbattono ogni rumore eccetto le vibrazioni che, in ogni caso, non infastidiscono.
Personale disponibile ma non una parola in lingua diversa dall'inglese.
Non collaudato il ristorante ma al pub annesso all'hotel i pasti sono buoni e abbondanti.     
Per il prezzo pagato nessun rimpianto ma a prezzo pieno sarebbe stato un salasso!!",2,2012,10,25
219,Para un viaje corto esta bien,"Se encuentra bien situado ya que esta al frente de la estacion de trenes O'Connolly, a 2 cuadras de la estacion de buses Busaras, parada del bus Airlink q te lleva al Aeropuerto  y caminando a unos 10 minutos de la O'Connell Street

Para un viaje corto esta bien, como fui fin de semana no pude dormir bien, los ultimos que salian de los pubs que hay por ahi, como a las 03:00 a.m. hacian mucha bulla. Necesitan urgente cambiar los colchones, el nuestro se hundia. El desayuno un poco aburrido, Irish Breakfast y un par de cosas mas.

La vista de nuestra ventana a un lado un  edificio moderno y al otro construccion. El hotel necesita una remodelacion,  felizmente que uno esta en el hotel solo para dormir. 

En nuestra opinion el hotel mas o menos, por lo que me parece caro el precio que pagamos, pero todo fue compensado por los dias tan bonitos que pasamos en Dublin, es una ciudad muy bonita.",3,2012,10,18
219,"Non gradevole, purtroppo.","Hotel situato di fronte alla stazione ferroviaria, contermine a binari ferroviari. Zona non gradevole, specie la sera.
Dalla camera in cui abbiamo alloggiato (suite al 6 piano di 7) si sentiva un continuo rumore di fondo delle macchine presenti sul tetto (forse condizionamento, o pi√π facilmente areazione delle canne ristorante situato al piano terra), oltre allo sferragliare dei treni.
Nel prezzo della camera non era inclusa la colazione (7 euro continentale, 10 irlandese). Incomprensibile la logica per cui il wifi debba essere pagato a parte (3 euro per 20 min). Frigobar vuoto; bagno con vasca (no bidet); asciugamano doccia striminzito, moquette da poco cambiata con forte odore di colla.
Lounge comune deprimente (nemmeno un giornale da leggere), con un persistente odore di deodorante floreale.
Purtroppo non ci siamo trovati bene come avremmo sperato, visto peraltro il prezzo non economico.

219,Hotel gradevole: Soddisfatti!,"Abbiamo trascorso 3 notti a luglio in quest'hotel e dobbiamo dire che la scelta si √® rivelata giusta.
E' ben posizionato sia verso il centro (√® alla fine di Talbot Street) che rispetto alla stazione dei bus Eireann (3 minuti a piedi).
La camera √® nella norma e la pulizia buona, peccato per il bagno minuscolo, cieco e senza ventola.
E' disponibile a buffet la colazione irlandese molto buona, compresa nella prenotazione.
L'unica pecca √® il costo per il deposito del bagaglio (3‚Ç¨ a valigia).. ci √® sembrata un'esagerazione visto che molti hotel lo fanno gratis.",4,2012,07,30
219,Un hotel consigliabile,"Questo hotel situato in Amiens Street √® vicino al centro e davanti alla principale stazione dei treni di Dublino. La pulizia √® molto buona. La cortesia √® alta e il servizio molto buono. Le sole piccole cose che desidero sottolineare sono: l'asciugacapelli √® riposto in un cassetto della camera anzich√® nel bagno. Inoltre sarebbe bene che ogni camera fosse dotata di adattatori alle prese anglosassoni diverse dalle nostre. Per la parte colazione, mancano le brioches e dolci in generale. In ogni caso il rapporto qualit√†/prezzo √® pi√π che buono.",4,2012,07,20
219,comodo perch√® si trova vicino al centro e pulito,"L'albergo √® situato vicino al centro in 5 minuti si arriva a O' Connell Street e in 10 min a Temple bar  ma se si √® troppo stanchi per camminare c'√® la fermata del pullman dall'altro lato della strada (vicino alla stazione). La  stanza al 6 piano era spaziosa, pulitia e silenziosa visto che  dava su una stradina laterale per cui non si sentivano i treni passare. Personale gentile. Prenotando in anticipo √® anche piuttosto economico. 
Unica nota negativa:  il wi fi √® a pagamento 3 euro per 20min opure 11euro per tutto il gg e se si lascia la valigia in giacenza prima della partenza si deve pagare 3 euro.",3,2012,07,08
219,comodo e pulito,"Quasi tutto perfetto, sia la posizione ottima per visitare la citt√† a piedi che la pulizia. I letti erano sempre rifatti, il sacchetto della pattumiera sempre cambiato, come gli asciugamani e non ho mai trovato un capello nella vasca o nel lavandino. 
Il problema √® che, essendo vicinissimo alla stazione, sia dei treni che dei pullman, di notte la zona si riempie di barboni che si ubriacano e fanno casino. un bel problema se si √® al primo piano. fortunatamente il letto √® talmente comodo e la stanchezza tanta che ci si addormenta facilmente.
in bagno non c'√® il phon, ma dopo una breve ricerca l'abbiamo trovato nel cassetto della scrivania in camera. altro piccolo inconveniente √® che nel lavandino l'acqua fredda e la calda hanno due rubinetti diversi. quindi, o ti geli le mani o te le bruci.",4,2012,05,31
219,Bella vacanza!,"Giudizio positivo. Ci hanno assegnato una suites da 3 letti ad una piazza e mezza al posto di una camera tripla normale!

219,Ok f√ºr einen Kurzutrip,"Das Hotel liegt auf der n√∂rdlichen Seite des Flusses Liffey, Fu√üweg ins Zentrum 10-15 Min., gute Lage!

Es macht einen alten, bi√üchen heruntergewohnten Eindruck, aber f√ºr den Preis ok. Die Rezeption ist nicht im EG, sondern die Treppe hoch und zu den Zimmern gelangt man √ºber einen Gang in ein anders Geb√§ude.
Es hat ein eigenes ""Pub"", was wir aber nicht getestet haben, da es in Temple Bar genug super Pubs gibt, unbedingt in das Pub ""Temple Bar"" gehen! Nahe dem Hotel gibts kleinere L√§den und Imbisse und nat√ºrlich den Bahnhof Connelly Station mit S- und Trambahn, diverse Buslinien sind in der N√§he. Mit der S-Bahn DART http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Area_Rapid_Transit kommt man von dort z.B. schnell zur Halbinsel Howth. 
TIPP: spart euch Airport-Bus oder Taxi (25‚Ç¨) zum Airport: es f√§hrt die Linie 41 (glaub ich mich richtig zu erinnern) zum Normalpreis/Tages/Wochenkarte) dort hin, Haltestelle ist ca. 10 Min. vom Hotel weg. Es gibt ein Kombi-Ticket Bus+Dart (z.b. bei der Connoly-Station).

Zur√ºck zum Hotel:
Fr√ºhst√ºck ist typisch british.. :( Auswahl ok: M√ºsli, Toast, Honig, Marmelade, Saft+Kaffe,Obst, W√ºrstchen, Ei. KEINE SEMMELN!  kostet 9‚Ç¨...etwas teuer.
Zimmer sind ok, alt, aber mit TV und guter Einrichtung, Wasserkocher...

219,"Ok, wenn einem die Umgebung egal ist.","Das North Star Hotel ist direkt gegen√ºber Conolly Station, deshalb die √úberschrift. Nicht gerade Dublins edelste Adresse, daf√ºr aber noch Innenstadtnah.

Das Hotel macht allgemein einen etwas abgewohnten Eindruck, das beginnt an der Rezeption unds geht √ºber die Flure bis in die Zimmer weiter. Der Teppichboden l√§dt nicht dazu ein, barfuss zu laufen, die Ausstattung der Zimmer ist auch nicht gerade berauschend, ebensowenig die schlecht abgedichteten Fenster. Wohnt man gerade zur Stra√üe raus, hat man wegen der Hochbahn das Gef√ºhl von Chicago.
Ich w√ºrde dieses Etablissement nur bedingt empfehlen, kommt v.a. auf den Preis an; zur Hochsaison hat man nicht immer die gr√∂√üte Auswahl an Hotels, die g√ºnstig sind und auch noch super-chic und -sauber.

219,"Premium Suites angbeoten aber laute, alte Zimmer im North Star Hotel","Der Besuch war privat, die Vorbereitung gut, wie wir glaubten. Um m√∂glichst zentral in Dublin zu wohnen w√§hlten wir das North Star Hotel, das nahe der Conolly Station und dem Busbahnhof am Custom House liegt.
Die Website zeigte moderne Zimmer - die Realit√§t war eine andere und wir flohen nach 1 Nacht. Wir hatten ein Twin Bett Zimmer gebucht, das jedoch zun√§chst nicht verf√ºgbar schien. Aiusserdem war ein ruhiges Nitruacherzimmer ausgew√§hlt bei HRS.
Auf mein Dr√§ngen hin bekamen wir dann ein Twin Bed Zimmer (getrennte Betten) und waren entsetzt:
Zimmer zur sehr stark befahrenen Strasse hin, im alten Teil des Geb√§udes, mit enem Minibad. Die Fenster konnte man wegen des L√§rms nicht √∂ffnen. Vor dem Zimmer fuhren die Nachtbusse ab und die Feuerwehr, Krankenwagen und Polizei benutzen woghl diese Strasse als Rennstrecke in der Nacht.
Ergebnis: Schlaf-Wachrhythmus im 10 min Takt, Wasser tr√∂pfelte nur aus dem Duschkopf, der Elektroschalter fiel immer wieder aus usw.  Am n√§chsten Morgen ein Fr√ºhst√ºck im bedr√ºckenden Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum, R√ºhrei war mit Eipulver zubereitet und w√§ssrig, MIneralwasser lauwarm, Bedinung unfreundlich.
Auch andere G√§ste, die aus dem neueren Teil des Hauses kamen, fragten wir nach ihrer Beurteilung:  ""Katastrophe"" lautete die Antwort.

Ci siamo immediatamente lamentati e alla reception ci hanno subito offerto (previa aggiunta di 'soli' euro 50 per notte!) un'altra camera che si trovava nell'ala nuova dell'hotel. Bella, pulita, con vista sulla stazione, al settimo piano. Non abbiamo avuto scelta. Era tarda sera e Non si poteva dormire nella stanza prenotata , cos√¨ abbiamo preso l'altra.

La stanza in cui abbiamo dormito era sicuramente accogliente ma, a quel costo avremmo scelto qualcos'altro.Anche la colazione (euro 9,90 a testa) non era completa, molto grassa, mancavano i croissant, la frutta fresca, il formaggio, gli insaccati, abbondanza di salsiccia e uova.",2,2008,10,22
219,dublin es una capital,"como en todas las capitales pues los precios resultan mas caros. el hotel no esta mal, bien situado, se llega al centro en 10 minutos andando y el bus 41 para el aeropuerto esta a dos calles de alli. la zona no esta mal, es como cualquier sitio en dublin. no me disgusto, pero tampoco es el palace por el precio, esta bastante echo polvo. aparece en un pasaje del ulyses.tiene un pub justo abajo y servicio restaurante. el desayuno cuesta 9e, creo que deberia estar incluido.

219,"orribile un'ala, decenta l'altra","se decidete di andarci, ricordate di prenotare le stanze dell'ala nuova (367/368 etc)
le altre come la 122/124 sono vecchie, maleodoranti, sporche e danno sulla ferrovia e sull'uscita d'emergenza del pub dell'albergo. un vero inferno
quando ci hanno cambiato le stanze il giorno dopo oggettivamente erano in linea con un albergo 2 stelle superior
staff antipatico e maldisposto verso 4 persone che non conoscono l'inglese
