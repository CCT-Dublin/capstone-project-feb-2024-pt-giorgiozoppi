41,"Location, Location, Location","First, the hotel’s location is fantastic. Located in the Gothic Quarter you are any easy walk to sights like the Cathedral and Picasso Museum. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby and so many great ancient streets to explore. I cannot imagine a better location in Barcelona if you are interested in the cities history.

Some of the staff were amazing and I want to specifically recognize Alejandra who handled our check in and check out. She went way above and beyond , allowing us to check in early and personally walking over to the restaurant and arranging for our breakfast. Also, Roberto was a tremendous help throughout the stay. He helped with bags, answered questions and was always cheerful and eager to assist in any way possible. 

Other positives:
- the bathroom in the room was great, except the mirror was way too small.
- Dinner in the restaurant was very good. My wife had chicken and I had a filet and we were both very pleased with the food quality and preparation. 
- Elevators were always readily available with virtually no waiting 
- The front desk was very helpful in arranging transportation 

Things that were not as great:
- I found the bed far too soft. Both my wife and I agreed it was the least supportive hotel mattress we could recall. The bed was also extremely low to the floor. Not something I had ever experienced in any Marriott brand hotel previously. 
- Overall, it felt as though in room design they placed form over function to an extreme. As mentioned before, the bathroom mirror was far too small but adorned over n a beautiful gold frame, the bed looked great but was low and uncomfortable, and I cannot imagine how uncomfortable it would have been to actually sit and work in the desk chair. 
- they have a rooftop bar with great views, but our second night there they closed it for a private party. I personally have an issue when hotels close their bars and restaurants to paying guests
- this is minor, but since I am a Marriott Titanium Member they sent a treat to my room as many hotels do. In this case it was 3 Oreos, which was really ridiculous 

Overall, the location and some of the outstanding staff lead me to recommend this hotel despite not loving the room itself.",4,2024,10,16
41,"Great location, great staff","Decided to switch to this hotel from another one a few days before departure based on location and Marriott points. So glad we did. Rooms are modern and clean. Front desk was amazing. Helped with taxi and accommodated late checkout in addition to just being nice and welcoming. Location is super walkable and near cathedral, between Born and Gothic Quarter. I would stay here again even if it is a bit pricey. Recommend rooftop bar for drinks and view. Punch Room speakeasy had great vibe, but drinks are all punch blends (it’s on me for not understanding that concept).  Partner and I both liked our drinks but punch in general isn’t my favorite. Room service was excellent for breakfast.",5,2024,10,13
41,Masterful!,"Unbeatable location. Outstanding hotel with a breathtaking rooftop bar. Rooms are VERY nice, beds so comfy you'll sleep-in & front desk/reception service is superior thanks to Irene & Nico who are passionate about their duties. Wonderful Concierge service from Enrique Pau, who is more than eager & willing to go beyond for any of his guests. However, the highlight of our stay was due to the staff at the rooftop bar where the view will have you gasping for more & the drinks are sensational. Excellent team of co-workers up there who's desire to make sure that their guests are impressed is unsurpassed. Awesome hospitality from Dylan, Vanessa, Eva & Nelson. Mission accomplished!  You guys are ""the doctors of rooftop relaxation!"" Job well done.",5,2024,10,12
41,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed here for two nights on a ""Celebration"" package that included several drinks, a dinner and breakfast along with tickets to the MOCO museum/gallery.
The hotel is in a great location next door to Santa Caterina market and 5 minutes walk from the Gothic Quarter.
From the moment we checked in we received very welcoming service from all the employees we interacted with - this really helped to make our stay extra special (special thanks to Sergio on the front desk).
We found the room to be very comfortable with amazing Edition branded toiletries in the bathroom with a signature scent.
The bathroom itself was a good size but with a distinct lack of hanging space/hooks. We were pleasantly surprised to find toilet douche.
The hotel is within walking distance of metro stations Urquinaona (L1 & L4) and Jaume I (L4) which was convenient for visiting the sights and also reaching the airport.
Breakfast is served a la carte instead of a buffet - this is a welcome change from most hotels.
Some of the public areas are very dimly lit - especially the first floor where the punch bar is located.
We found the terrace bar to be quite busy most of the time and a little congested but some of the views are fantastic.
We enjoyed our meal in the Veraz restaurant - all courses were of a high quality and well prepared. Service was very good.
Overall we had a fantastic visit in Barcelona and thank The Edition for being our comfortable home from home for a few days.",5,2024,10,12
41,Great location,Excellent location and very convenient for walking around the historical town.  Staff was top notch.  We ate breakfast here a couple days and the food was good.  The front desk was very professional and everyone provided a high level of serve.  I would recommend this hotel.,4,2024,09,30
41,Bad hotel,Not a good hotel and not worthyfive star . It was a bad experience as the electricity was cut off for more than two hours and they did not have a generator to operate and the breakfast was very poor so I will not repeat the bad experience there are a lot of better hotels,2,2024,09,25
41,"Nice hotel, excellent service.","We stayed for six nights during our stay in Barcelona and loved it. It’s a great location, within easy walking distance to the Gothic quarter, the port, and many other nearby sites. The service was outstanding in every way. Everyone was extremely friendly and went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had breakfast in the restaurant each morning, and the food and service were outstanding. Our room was a little small, especially considering the rate we paid, but it was an overall enjoyable stay.",5,2024,09,22
41,Best chain hotel that doesn’t feel like it’s a chain,"If you’re looking for a 5 star boutique hotel which is elegant and understated. Then this is the one. It has to be one of my favourite hotels I have stayed at. From the welcoming lobby to the amazing scent they have pumping out. To the wonderful decor. 

The rooms are comfortable with great views of the city. The toiletries provided smell incredible and there is a large spacious rainfall shower. I received complimentary treats in the room which looked like a work of art. 

The location is great. Perfect for visiting the Gothic Cathedral (which some of its spires can be seen from the rooftop bar) to only a short walk from the trendy neighbourhood of El Born which is where the iconic Paradiso and Monk bars are. Not to mention many other great bars and restaurants. 

The rooftop bar is a must. Although going in January it was still warm enough to sit in the day and enjoy some light bites while taking in the views and then in the evening enjoying the cocktails.",5,2024,09,12
41,"Great location, nice property, excellent service","Had a wonderful stay recently when I visited for a meeting and some leisure with my wife. From the moment we reached the hotel we had wonderful attention from all staff. At Checkin, Lucia was very helpful by specially facilitating an early checkin after our long travel. The room was very well appointed if slightly small with excellent amenities. A nice Bay window and the toilet was again very clean with nice amenities. The Edition touch was clearly evident. On request a nice tea kettle with all amenities was promptly kept in the room and replensihed daily. 
The roof bar has amazing views in the evening and again the staff made extra efforts to pamper us. 
The first floor bar is very nice and one of the days we had a nice surprise waiting in the room with lovely delicious rose pastries and a cute letter from the staff. 
The breakfast was again very wholesome with a nice menu. Again the staff was very courteous and helpful each time we went. 
Fabian and Agostina just to mention a few. 
The concierge desk manned by Rodrigo was again helpful and quickly organized  complimentary pickup and drops to the outlet mall. The location could not be better a stone’s throw from the cathedral. We never really felt unsafe as some others mentioned. 
All in all it was a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend the hotel. 
All in all",5,2024,09,10
41,Intuitive service!,"Had the privilege of staying here during our trip to Europe in August 2024.
We received a masterclass on how to take care of a customer from their astonishingly good team!
The term I would use for their service is Intuitive Hospitality!   Each member of their team anticipated our desires before we even realized what we wanted! 
I have not experienced this level of attention at any other hotel I have stayed. 
From the Valet who saw us driving past the hotel and stopping unsure where to pull in and came up to the car which was then across the street from the hotel!  Tapped on the window and smiled asking if we were looking for the hotel! Check in was as if I had stayed a million times previously. The wonderful young lady that checked us in should give classes in how to make a guest feel welcome! Nelson the manager/Supervisor up at the rooftop lounge was a friend when we left. Stunning views of the city and stunning service to match! The food was exquisite in each area we ate. The room accommodations were created with intuitive in mind. Everything was exactly where it needed to be! The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept on! 
I cannot stress to you how good this stay was. Run! do not walk to this hotel in Barcelona. It made a phenomenal city that much better for us!
Thank you Edition staff, you will be remembered fondly!",5,2024,08,19
41,Best spot in BCN!,"I love the edition hotels and this was truly fab. Loved the hotel decor,  amazing rooftop, comfortable bedding and luxe amenities. Location is close to so many good shops, bars and restaurants. The concierge from Argentina and the front desk ( Elena and Sergio) are amazing. Thanks so much for your help! You made our stay amazing and we can’t wait to return!",5,2024,08,15
41,Excellent,"Good day  !

On July 25-26, my wife and I were guests at the EDITION hotel in Barcelona. The hotel, perfectly located, was one of many on our holiday trip this year and the last one in Barcelona. From the very beginning, the moment we were checked in by the receptionist (July 25), we were surrounded by care and extraordinary hospitality. The people working at the reception, in the entire front office, extremely cultured, smiling, very patient, objective, impeccably professional, with a presence and style emphasizing the character of this unique place and a professional approach to guests, made us feel at home. Our room in the hotel, sterile and functional, very comfortable and cozy, created a unique microclimate for us. Thanks to the quietly working air conditioning on these hot Barcelona days, we could quickly relax and regain strength after an exhausting journey and prepare for the next one. We must admit that the hotel has the most efficient air conditioning among the hotels we have stayed in previously, which was invaluable at this time of year. In the breakfast restaurant, the a la carte menu, which met our expectations and the staff, extremely hospitable, professional, with their behavior and clothing (stylish shoes instead of sports shoes - bravo!), emphasized the individual style of this place. The delicious omelette, toast with egg, pancakes and delicious cappuccino delighted us. Please thank the kitchen staff, true craftsmen. In particular, we want to praise the lady who checked us in, did us a favor and extended the day, we needed it and we got it, the gentlemen waiters in the breakfast restaurant, extremely tactful, the charming hostess and the people who checked us out. In the hotel, you can see that the entire, such an efficiently operating mechanism, is supervised by Mrs. Brunella Zinato, the General Manager of the hotel. In the hotel, you could see that we were dealing with a professional, an extremely sensitive person who feels what she is doing with her whole being and knows what she is doing very well. In the evening, live music in the restaurant! On this occasion, we must mention that our stay this year at the hotel of the General Manager was not the first in hotels in Barcelona, ​​so we have a point of reference to what is in other places, and it is in the EDITION Barcelona hotel with Mrs. Brunelli. The unique face of this place is noticeable, resulting from the translation of the great commitment, knowledge in the hotel industry of the General Manager, her vast professional experience, a specific instinct, a person hungry for success. We were said goodbye by the ladies at the hotel reception and the entire front office, Laura, Pau, Ahmed, Roberto and the charming hostess from the restaurant (July 26). People, very hospitable, patient and cultured, who, as was evident when we waited in the lobby, full of composure, were able to explain everything precisely to customers dealing with their matters.

Once again, we would like to thank all the staff of the EDITION Barcelona hotel for making our holiday journey, which is still ongoing, unforgettable. The people who noticed us at every turn were always nearby, but not intrusive.

Mrs. Brunello Zinato, General Manager, thank you very much for the individual treatment you gave us as your guests. We congratulate the crew and wish you a full occupancy every day, because it is your people who create this unforgettable atmosphere of this special place.

Aldona and Robert Szparaga",5,2024,07,29
41,Barcelona,Stayed here while visiting our daughter who is studying in Barcelona.  What an amazing hotel.  Clean.  Warm.  Great bar and amazing rooftop bar and pool!   Highly recommended.  Perfectly located in the center of all the best restaurants and shops.,5,2024,06,24
41,"Excellent hotel, great location","We liked the hotel and would stay here again.
Flew in from Granada, got to the hotel at 1530, left our bags, and toured the Cathedral. The next day a short walk to the Picasso Museum, then lunch at the hotel, followed by a walk to see the Palau de la Musica Catalana, and from there a longer walk to Casa Mila, with tours at each.
The next 2 days we had 2 private tours that picked us up in front of the hotel. It is a restricted traffic area. 
Our room was on the 8th floor and quiet. King bed, Santa Caterina Deluxe guest room. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom has a good size shower. Even though there is one sink, the counter space was ok.
Breakfast is made to order from the menu, and it is excellent. 
Most service was great. I did find the front desk less than helpful. 15 minute wait for a taxi the day we went to the airport. No change the day we were leaving on an 8:30 private tour to Girona  and Figures. Apparently, the person who can make change arrives at 9 or later. Fortunately, a young man from the restaurant went and found change. The restaurant staff is great.
However, those are minor issues, it's a great place to stay.",5,2024,06,08
41,The roof top bar is EXCELLENT,"I was very tempted to give 4 stars.. but lets go with 5!

So the good:
1. The rooftop bar. Its FANTASTIC. And they do this right: they PRIORITISE people staying in the hotel. This alone makes it worth while. Too many hotels, when they have a stunning view/bar/kind of rooftop pool like this let in all or pressure you to move on. Not here: spent two nights (and way too much money on the asian street food), but this make the hotel worth every penny.
2. A little touch: room service bundle my iPhone charging cables with a little velcro band. What a nice touch. Clever! Oh, and they have plenty of plugs and USB chargers in the room. Excellent. 
3. Lovely staff, esp the reception. The bar staff were a bit meh, nice enough, but perhaps not as attentive, and definitely could have got us to spend a bit more if they were faster in replenishing rounds!

So why the hesitancy in possibly dropping a star?

Well, this is purely down to maintenance. The entrance to the lift had chips and scratches... tiny details, but the biggest downside. 

Overall EXCELLENT. Indeed, due to go back to Barca in a few days, but with the wife, and had booked Hotel Arts.. seriously considering changing this to EDITION. If only the latest price was not so £@$£ expensive. 

Highly recommended",5,2024,06,05
41,"Overall, a disappointing stay","The good: 

This hotel is very conveniently located. It is walking distance from all the main tourist attractions, and near many great bars and restaurants. 

We were greeted by a very friendly doorman who helped us with our bags. The check in staff were also nice and attentive. 

We were in Room 901. The room wasn’t bad. A bit small. The terrace was a really nice space.

The shampoo, conditioner and body wash is from Le Labo. Very nice products. 

There’s also a good hairdryer and an iron and ironing board.

The robes are very comfortable. 

The plunge pool isn’t bad, though the water is freezing and it’s in the shade in the afternoon. 

The bad:

The mattress is not very comfortable and the pillows are lumpy and very flat. 

The shower is alright. There’s a rain shower and a separate handheld jet. You can’t activate both at once. The water pressure is decent. 

The toilet has an odd hose, which I suppose is for a bidet-like use, but the set up is odd. 

There is no room to hang up towels or bathing suits in the bathroom or in the room, so you have to put everything on the floor. 

We went to the rooftop bar one night for a drink, no one came to serve us. We tried to wave the servers down (it wasn’t very busy) with no luck. We waited 25 minutes and then finally left. 

Perhaps the most disappointing was the noise. At 8am on Saturday morning, there was very loud banging that lasted for 2 hours. It seemed like they were doing maintenance or cleaning on the roof (right above our room) or in an adjacent room. The same thing happened on Sunday morning, starting at 7:45am. 

The service from the staff (other than the doormen and housekeepers) is subpar. Because there is a lounge, a restaurant, and a rooftop bar, which aim at attracting non-guests, the focus seems to be on getting those people in to spend money at the hotel, rather than ensuring that the guests are happy. 

Everything is absurdly overpriced (they would’ve charged us 6 euros to bring a tea bag up to the room). We also did laundry and one pair of socks was extremely expensive. 

If this was a 3-star hotel for 500$ (CAD), then no complaints, but this is a 5-star hotel for $1,600 (CAD) (or $1,000 euros). We were expecting a lot more.",3,2024,05,17
41,Edition Experience,"People were very friendly, the room was beautiful and clean every day. The concierge helped us on some ocasions and gave us valuable information. The hotel is very well located and I felt very safe around. The roof top is amazing. We enjoyed, unforgettable experience!",5,2024,05,16
41,Disappointing for the high price paid!,"The Barcelona EDITION is in the Gothic Quarter in the old section of Barcelona. It is within walking distance of La Rambla, the main street that stretches from the marina to Catalunya Square. We booked a 3 day stay.
 
Vlad, the doorman, greeted our taxi and offered assistance with our luggage - a really nice touch, considering that the taxi was on the opposite side of the street. 
 
Laura at the front desk greeted us with a wonderful smile and checked us in quickly and surprised us with a one class upgrade, even though our room would not be ready for a few hours. In fairness, it was 0900 in the morning, and we had just gotten off a cruise so a delay in getting into the room was expected.
 
The room was ready for us at noon, which is as advertised for a Titanium Bonvoy Elite member. The room was small, for a luxury hotel, even in Europe. What made it an upgrade was a bump-out window with a seating area, otherwise it was the standard room. 
 
There are some nice finishes in the room such as the leather headboard and deep wood paneling but was offset by a flimsy plastic desk chair and cheap desk and stained throw carpeting. For the price of this hotel, the room was a disappointment. 
 
The bed linens were of good cotton quality, but the foam pillows were lumpy. The feather pillows were very nice. The bed felt like a discount hotel mattress. 
 
The bathroom had a large shower with rain shower head and additional wand but had no where to put anything. The sink area also lacked storage. The shower toiletries (shampoo, etc.) were from Le Labo and were of exceptionally high quality. 
 
The rooftop lounge is very nice with a beautiful view of the city or towards the beach. The drinks are nice, but the atmosphere is a bit pretentious. 
 
We arrived at the lobby one day to beautiful Brazilian Jazz. The duo was so good that we wanted to get a drink at the bar and enjoy their music. We wanted to sit on the side of the bar that allowed us to look at the entertainers, but a server was using that area to roll silverware. We asked if we could sit there, and they said NO. We moved to a seat on the other side of the bar that was in the traffic lane, only to observe a couple coming out of the elevator to sit in those exact seats. They were not waiting; they had just arrived. We felt as if we did not belong, so we left, but called Michael Osorio, the Manager on Duty. 
 
Mr. Osorio told us they were waiting for that table, which we knew was not true and offered us a table and complementary drinks. We felt so slighted by this whole experience that we turned down the offer but appreciated the gesture. 
 
The next day we waited an hour and a half for a bucket of ice after multiple calls and texts using the Marriott chat app. 
 
For the price of this hotel and the 5-star rating that they advertise I can unfortunately only give a 3-star rating. I would not stay at this hotel again.",3,2024,04,29
41,Amazing Service is The Barcelona EDITION's mission and it shows.,"The Barcelona EDITION was a hotel that we weren't sure about booking but then figured that it looked okay.  It blew away our expectations.  From the moment that you walk in the door, the staff is there to welcome and assist you with anything that you would like.  

Rita checked us in and having a not so great flight from Boston to Barcelona, she made those 14 hours worth it.  She was attentive to our requests and even though the room wasn't ready yet (we were early), she ensured that we were only sitting there a few minutes waiting.  Meanwhile, they brought water over and we just felt ""cared for"" right from the beginning.  

Breakfast every day, that is included, was awesome and by the last day we were sorry to say goodbye to the team that welcomed us every day.  

We had one hiccup with the room, there was a smell coming from a drain.  We mentioned it and left for dinner.  By the time we came back, it was cleaned and smelled great.  To top it off, we received a hand written note with some chocolate to say that they were there to help and if we need anything else to let them know. 

I see why this is listed as a five-star hotel in Barcelona.  The service is top notch.  Our room was great but that bathroom was truly outstanding.  

If you are debating on where to stay in Barcelona, this is located in such a great spot of the city and once again the service is fantastic.  This was our first trip to this great city and we will for sure be back to this hotel when we return!",5,2024,04,18
41,Beautiful Property and Great Rooftop,Great property centrally located to many neighborhoods. The room was clean and new which is always a plus. The staff was very kind from check in to the restaurant on the roof which I really enjoyed. Perfect property for a quick stay and walking distance to many of the places I wanted to see!,5,2024,03,22
41,"Almost an actual 5-star hotel, but not quite","The good:
-Young, eager, service-oriented staff
-Solid room, comfy bed
-Great location
-Edition roof decks are fun— full stop 
-Good food

The “needs work”:
-Plumbing from adjacent room made it seem like I was literally showering when they were
-Young staff… isn’t polished. 
-No benefit to being Bonvoy overachiever

The “bad”:
-If you stay in a materially premium room, great hotels will do something to make your stay memorable.  Something you don’t expect.  In the absence thereof, it’s just another premium hotel in a very competitive world. Hence the “title.”",4,2024,03,09
41,They canceled my reservations!,"They canceled my reservations despite being a Marriott Titanium Member and Lifetime Platinum and knowing that the EDITION  is my favorite brand in the Marriott Portfolio.  They could care less about Marriott Elites & those that prefer the EDITION Hotel Brand.

Even though many reviews complain about the small rooms, staff that is not able to handle a hotel of its size and many reviews from Marriott Elites to stay away, I still
booked a few rooms for an upcoming vacation, as the EDITION is still one of my favorite brands.  My reservations were also confirmed with the hotel's Guest Experience Agent.  Seems they did a buyout of the hotel and sold my rooms...

I understand the EDITION portfolio offers limited Marriott Elite Benefits, but never thought they would cancel my reservations because they oversold their rooms...

I would NOT recommend The Barcelona EDITION, especially if you're an Marriott Elite Member.  The staff here do not care about loyal guest...",1,2024,03,05
41,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed with the place. We came to the bar at around 8 o’clock at the evening to have some cocktails. We ordered pornstar martinis and then the waiter came up to us before bringing the order and told us that this is the last round and asked us if we would like to order more, we said that we would like the same cocktail to which he replied that they don’t have enough ingredients, so we ordered cosmopolitan cocktail. Both of the cocktails were half empty and tasted awful. The decorations were also super ugly not like they are supposed to be. We complained to the waiter and he brought us some disgusting shots of gin with wasabi that were impossible to drink. Overall rush at the bar gave us negative impression, since the waiter brought us a bill before we even had a chance to ask and asked us to pay. We were a group of 4 and asked to split the bill in half which apparently is NOT allowed. Super dissatisfied with such a hype place.",2,2024,02,21
41,Asim at the bar area was Brilliant,"Asim at the bar area was brilliant made the best cocktail my partner has tasted 10/10!!!!

The views to the city the location makes this hotel brilliant , the bar food was also nice

Will definitely be coming back here 

Please do not give this or Asim drinks a miss when you come to Barcelona!!!",5,2024,02,04
41,Outstanding experience from product to service,"Had the most fantastic stay at the Barcelona Edition Hotel Dec 11-15!  The staff is what makes this hotel so special.  They are all so young, energetic and truly are passionate about hospitality and their customers.  The hotel is in a great location walking distance from all cool restaurants, bars and some of the best site seeing.  The rooms are modern, clean and the hotel offers a fantastic breakfast; a cool speak easy in the evening and great drinks in the lobby bar.

The front desk staff and the concierge (Rodrigo and Sebastian) were amazing in helping us plan our days, organize a private tour and secure tickets and reservations.

Loved the lobby bar staff as well who always went out of their way to remember my drink and make me feel so at home and welcome

Kudo's to the General Manager of this hotel who really assembled a special team of young people who really understand hospitality.  I love Edition Hotels in general and this one was magical.",5,2023,12,25
41,My stay at edition barcelona,I was disappointed from the room size to small for us from middle east and there concierge is bad the help desk was not helpful no one pick up they always ignore and the breakfast wasn’t good my stay was average good.                                                          For a future stay i would maybe come back to them,3,2023,12,21
41,Great stay but be sure to review your bill before checkout! ,"We had the most wonderful stay at The Barcelona Edition. It's the perfect location and the staff is lovely, but be sure to check your bill and address any issues before checkout. We booked directly through Marriott and had a $50 F&B credit tied to our reservation which the front desk staff noted when we checked in. They suggested that we opt for the daily breakfast ($70/day) and then with the credit it would be $20/ day. The daily breakfast was a great option for us since we had early plans every day and we were very happy with the food options and service. Unfortunately, we had to quickly check out on our last day and didn't have the opportunity to thoroughly review our bill. Oddly, the hotel never uploaded it to my Marriott account or emailed it to me, so I had to follow up 3 times in order to get a copy of it. It turns out they did not apply the $50 daily credit to our stay and after chasing via email multiple times, we've simply given up.  A bit disappointed given our actual stay was wonderful and we are loyal Marriott Elite members. ",4,2023,12,19
41,5 star hotel - 5 star service,"What a fantastic hotel. Located in the heart of Barcelona. I stayed for four days and it was an absolut blast! The breakfast is amzaing! 

I will defently go back to Barcelona and stay at The Edition! ",5,2023,12,10
41,Redeemed,Our check in experience as a titanium bonvoy member left a lot to be desired.  I mentioned our experience on this forum and received a call from Cesk a manager who gave us an experience at their restaurant to make up for the failed expectations at check in.  He more than outdid himself and we really appreciate the gesture and kindness!  I would give this hotel another opportunity if I come back to Barcelona thanks to their attempt to reconcile!,4,2023,11,21
41,Barcelona ’23,Excellent hotel and wonderful service. Would definitely come back and stay. Just about 15 minutes walk to a lot of places around Gothic Quarters. There’s also a market next door and laundromat right around the corner. ,5,2023,11,20
41,Modern with a commendable staff.,"Very modern and sleek hotel. Good location near everything. But what stood out for me was the warmth and courtesy of the staff. Sergio was efficient at check in, while the other early morning reception staff was also very helpful and made sure I was safe with the taxi. Elite membership was also recognized. Will come back.",5,2023,10,31
41,Poor checkin experience due to poor management,"Good location and comfortable but small rooms. The check-in experience was extremely disappointing. I had booked 3 rooms about 4 months in advance and provided flight arrival times to the concierge. 2 of our 3 rooms were available for early check-in but the third was told upon arrival that the room would not be available until 5:00 as they had given Bonvoy member late checkout. We pointed out we are Bonvoy members and asked why they gave others late checkout when they knew we were coming in after long travel with expectations we could check in at normal time. We were also not upgraded. Given I booked 27 nights of rooms withBonvoy for this trip alone on top of a lot of nights on other trips, I was incensed with the attitude of the checkin manager. I asked to see his manager who couldn’t be bothered. I asked for temporary checkin room to rest (other properties offer). They did do when I reminded them we’d booked months in advance and reminded how much I was spending on my Spain trip. This left a bad taste for Bonvoy. They did same Thing at property in Madrid Bonvoy property: gave someone else late checkout so we couldn’t check in until 5. Bonvoy: advice: do not give late checkout when you have fully booked rooms and know your customers arrival times. With no upgrades and 2 out of 3 hotels delaying our checkin to accommodate others makes me feel I should prioritize other loyalty programs. No loyalty for customers   On a positive note, roof top bar and bar tenders a highlight. Skip the punch bar. Maid also nice and highly effective. Breakfast good.",4,2023,10,22
41,Bad drinks at Barcelona Edition ,"Went to Barcelona for one day. I've been in other Edition hotels before, but for sure the worst so far.
Not even a simple greeting, not any smile at all, nice food but not that tasty. And the worse part, the cocktails. I think it wasn't a bartender, i'm not sure, but watery drinks, with lack of flavour, from the table i saw the show, not a professional for sure, he looked like a manager and not even him smiled at all along the whole slow service.

41,If we return to Barcelona it will definitely be to a different hotel.,"Room 902. The lighting control and sound system don’t work properly. The penthouse is very dark with all the lights on. The Bluetooth system sounds like crap and only works in some rooms. Living room TV had no sound. The guest bathroom lighting didn’t turn on. Pillows are beat up and flimsy. AC stopped working at 1am. Using the Bonvoy app to message front desk was great, but their solution was coming up to the room to reset the AC controls. Literally at 1:40am when 1 out of 2 systems didn’t “reset remotely”. Nope, at $2700
Euro a night - unacceptable. A real epic failure. This room shouldn’t be rented out",2,2023,10,08
41,Exceptional Staff!  Exceptional Service.,"The staff was amazing.  Every single person was friendly & helpful.  From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel special. 
They were engaging.  Friendly.  Each time we headed out, they walked us outside and helped with directions and maps. 
Showed interest in us and what we were doing.  
Welcomed us back.  Remembered what we’d been doing and asked about our excursions.  Cautioned us about being careful.  Leon (right name I hope) helped with our bags & was great!   Breakfast was good.  Our server excellent.  
Simply put…  A very well run hotel. Our compliments to the management team.",5,2023,09,29
41,Great Staff and Great Service!,"Great experience at Edition Barcelona is even made greater by the whole staff team in the hotel! 

All staff are genuinely helpful when we asked about where to go and where to eat etc.

I forgot my cell phone in the taxi. When I seek assistance from the staff, they jumped in immediately. Special thanks to Roberto. He diligently helped to track the taxi driver and got my phone back within hours!

Barcelona Edition Team made me feel I want to stay in Edition again in my upcoming trip in US!",5,2023,09,16
41,Great stay— hope to return soon!,"The Barcelona edition is a beautiful, intimate luxury hotel. It’s on the smaller side, so don’t expect a large pool or expansive fitness center— but the rooms are comfortable and the staff is a treat. 

Additionally, the food and drink at the onsite restaurants is actually excellent. I typically avoid hotel restaurants but had a great evening of drinks and snacks on their rooftop, and the breakfast in the downstairs restaurant was the perfect way to start the day. Indirà and Daniela at Bar Velaz remembered me, anticipated my needs, and made me feel at home away from home.",5,2023,09,12
41,Wonderful small hotel,"Top three reasons why the Edition is a wonderful hotel….(1) Location, (2) Staff (3) the roof top…..(1) great location for walking- adjacent to narrow alley old town (not recommended at night), an easy walk to some sights- two Gaudi buildings, museums- and all level shopping incl luxury avenue, many good restaurants and cafes nearby; easy cab ride- cabs are plentiful- to Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia (of course, a must see!) ….(2) staff is amazing- pleasant, helpful, professional ….from check in with Laura to concierge Paul, to Lise on the roof, + really missed too many names to mention- basically everybody! (3) in 3 days, we visited the roof top 3 times for cocktails and lite bites- really cool! Great views, great service! ……in addition, all spaces are nicely done; the room was small hotel euro size, well appointed, comfortable bed, quiet, good AC, nicely done….   In total, highly recommend the Barcelona Edition- a wonderful small hotel.",5,2023,09,12
41,"Not bad, not fantastic ","Not bad, not fantastic. 

The room was interesting. We paid extra upon check in for a room upgrade to what was described as a bigger room but honestly, it was still small, with nowhere to put your luggage either. The room also has extremely dusty air con vents which seemed like they hadn’t been cleaned in years. 

That said, the staff were lovely, really pleasant, especially on the roof & the bar area. I would stay here again but I’d know what I’d be getting this time. ",3,2023,08,17
41,Stay here in Barcelona,Choose this hotel in Barcelona because it's a Marriott propery and is close to the Gothic quarter. We had a great stay here. Hotel is clean and well-maintained. One of our rooms had a very spacious balcony. The rooftop bar and lounge was a great place to relax in the afternoon and the whole place seemed to be a hotspot in the evenings. The staff was incredibly helpful in assisting us to arrange a set of services we needed for our trip and everything they handled worked out perfectly. I was very happy with our stay here and would recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.,5,2023,08,08
41,3 days in Barcelona,"We just finished 3 days stay here. Since we like  EDITION brand we prefered to stay here over the Hotel arts ( ritz ) . Hotel itself is pretty small. Small room, lobby, rooftop and pool but serves the purpose. Friendly staff, especially front desk. We’ll definitely stay here again when we come back to Barcelona.",5,2023,07,30
41,Wonderful time and a lovely hotel!,"I had a lovely time at The Barcelona Edition while on vacation with friends. Upon arrival, we were greeted by so many attentive and friendly staff members, who took care to ensure we were comfortable and enjoyed our stay, and this extended through the week. I truly couldn’t speak more highly of the staff at the hotel—everyone was lovely! The hotel is also centrally located, which made getting around easy. The rooms were a good size and furnished nicely, which was great after a long day in the Barcelona sun. Finally, the rooftop, restaurant, and hotel bar were great, with excellent drink and food options. Should I find myself back in Barcelona, I would not hesitate to stay here!",5,2023,07,24
41,Stylish boutique hotel in a great location,"Very stylish hotel with a beautiful rooftop bar. The hotel is really well located on the edge of the Gothic Quarter, easy walking distance to lots of great neighborhoods and attractions. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We had a basic room with a King bed. It was rather small for 2 people (in particular there was no good place to put 2 suitcases) but the bed was very comfortable and there were lots of different lighting options, which I loved. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,06,22
41,Most amazing hotel!!!,"I wish I could give this hotel 10 stars. The staff are truly amazing. We walked in and my daughter was feeling dizzy from the car ride from the airport. They immediately gave her some cold water and came back to check on her. The rooms are remarkable. The beds are so soft and cozy. Each room has a window seat  which was super cozy. The technology in each room was nice and made it easy to turn off lights, close blinds etc from the push of a button.  The breakfast was fabulous and they had a lot of great options. They had live music at night and a nice bar and lobby area to sit and relax.",5,2023,06,17
41,Magnificent 5 star service,"The hotel was a magnificent gem in a crown of a city! The concierge ( Sebastian) went out of his way to make our trip special, even  working  after  hours. We are grateful to the entire staff who made every effort to provide  5 star service! We will definitely return.",5,2023,06,06
41,Highly Recommended,This is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location.  We ate at Veraz and The Roof.  The food was very good at both restaurants.  There are spectacular views from The Roof.  Best of all was the service.  Every employee was great.  They are extremely helpful and friendly.  They all seem genuinely happy to be there.  We were even offered wine by one of the bellman while we were waiting for our room.  It was a short wait.  Most of all I would like to extend a special thanks to Franco G for his assistance.,5,2023,06,01
41,Could be better ,"We made a booking for the roof top, but we made a mistake and had booked the Veraz restaurant downstairs. we explain them and they make us wait 30 min to go to the rooftop. 
When we went up, the roof was empty ... this is not professionnal at all, i can imagine its a famous spot and they want to keep the exclusivity .. but not like this... hospitality management is the key today, you need to receive people and make them enjoy. 
Following this, the roof was empty ... the service was excellent, we had the best waitress ever, she even gave us some tips for Bcn. 
",3,2023,05,30
41,Exceptional service and hospitality,"Where do I start we simply loved everything about our stay at the edition.  We stayed here April 18th - 21st and the staff specifically the concierge, night bell man on the 18th and front desk were beyond helpful and accommodating.

I unfortunately lost the card with their names but those three guys helped my mom and I tremendously - from recommendations, transportations and other tidbits which made our stay very special.

Lou Lou on the rooftop was exceptional and actually would remember our morning order which added that extra touch of personalization and guest service.  Lisa I believe was her name at the rooftop bar (evening) was also fabulous.

The Edition hotel is one of my favorite luxury boutique hotels and the Barcelona one didn’t disappoint - the rooms were gorgeous, clean and well appointed.  The rooftop had breath taking views  and the bar on the 1st floor was great for a nightcap.  On top of the service, great rooms the hotel was in an exceptional location which made exploring super easy!  

We spent three days here and then moved to the W and it was nowhere near the level of luxury service - quite frankly we regretted having not stayed at the Edition for our entire stay!",5,2023,05,08
41,Great staff inadequate facilitiesi,"We had one of the largest balcony rooms 904 but the room itself barely fit the king size bed.  It was noisy at night.   We could hear the roof top bar.   The ants from the balcony were numerous and kept invading our bedroom.  The hallways and bedroom were dark making it difficult to see at night.  
We had lunch upstairs at the roof top bar.  The setting was lovely but it was it was understaffed.  The menu was Japanese street food. I had the chicken and tuna.   I was underwhelmed by both.  
Even though the staff at the front desk and concierge were great I can not recommend this hotel",3,2023,05,03
41,Amazing! ,Amazing experience! Thanks to Francesc M. the first night in Barcelona was amazing because of the perfect atmosphere and professional service! Thank you for all! This is amazing and a great experience!,5,2023,04,07
41,Excellent Hotel ,"Excellent service, food, accommodations, location!! Superb staff!!!! Restaurant had great food and drinks. The rooftop bar was great and the views were amazing!!!
I highly recommend this property! I would stay here again!!",5,2023,04,02
41,A great experience!,"Was there for a conference in March. It was busy and hotel apologized that they could not upgrade me due to a full occupancy. They did whatever they could to make stay comfortable, and I had a good time there. I will return for my next vacation or business trip for sure.",5,2023,03,28
41,Perfect,"Exceptional stay in a beautifully designed hotel. Large immaculate room with perfect bed  (white linen with down duvet), a comfortable seating area with sofa, table & window seat and beautifully designed bathroom with soaking tub, separate shower and loo along with Le Labo toiletries (had I known, wouldn't have brought my own). Normally I'm not a fan of scented hotels (whoever thought of this is the same person that came up ""resort"" fees and paid wi-fi) but their signature scent was gorgeous. 

What really made this a fabulous stay was the staff, food & cocktails. The staff were friendly and helpful but not in a forced fake way or over the top. Special thanks to the concierge staff who helped with sightseeing stuff, Benjamin in the bar and Alexsia in the resto but all the staff were great, though roof staff not friendly our first evening.  One morning I missed breakfast hours but the kitchen kindly rustled up their superb avocado toast for 4th morning in a row. Appetizers & cocktails on the roof also outstanding - Japanese fusion -- as was dinner downstairs. Would have been very easy to have all meals here but we did venture out for memorable meals elsewhere. Finally, the fabulous Punch room --had way too many of their delish punches & I cannot remember the last time we played pool, a lovely throw back to another life.

Location was perfect for us as we love walking everywhere & we enjoyed the traditional market next door. I don't understand how another reviewer blames the hotel for being robbed. This city has been infamous for pickpockets since I first came  30 years ago. It's not the hotel's fault if you don't have your wits about you & don't take precautions. I wandered the gothic area alone with a small crossbody bag, no flashy valuables and a healthy dose of caution. Nearly every evening we walked to and from rests without once feeling unsafe. 

I nearly forgot to mention the music, an eclectic mix which added to the vibe.

One thing to note:  The terrace room we almost switched to had a very large terrace but the room itself was too small for us so we stayed in the original loft room my husband had booked. I'd recommend looking at room sizes when booking.",5,2023,03,07
41,BEST HOSPITALITY,"Stayed a couple days while working in Barcelona and had an incredible experience. Beautiful room, good size, and all the amenities. The restaurants are great and the overall vibe of the hotel is very pleasant. 

The staff was super accommodating, making my trip stress free. I had lots of packages delivered and sent out which most of the time is super complicated, but Sebastian at the concierge took care of all my needs seamlessly! 

Hopefully be back soon. Xx",5,2023,03,02
41,The Best!,"Loved everything about our weeklong stay. Staff were warm and friendly from advance communication and check-in through to check-out. Quick resolutions to any requests. Dining and drinks venues were fab. Enjoyed rooftop, cabaret, and Bar Veraz. Can’t wait to return. Perfect location for exploring the city.",5,2023,02,24
41,TOP ,"The Barcelona EDITION hotel has a unique location. 
Rooms are nice, clean and have a good atmosphere. 
The roof top bar is a great experience overlooking the city of Barcelona. 
Staff is polite friendly and attentive. 
Just the elevators would need a bit of refresh.
Highly recommended. 
",5,2023,01,16
41,Great locations,"The hotel is clean, great staff, modern, comfortable.  The location was great,  very centrally located with a nice rooftop bar.   Not a huge property but perfect if you're in Barcelona for a few days.   We spent 6 nights.   Can walk anywhere from this hotel.",5,2023,01,15
41,Robbed a block away - stay away,"First - the hotel staff was pleasant and friendly.  That’s the highlight of our stay.

This is NOT a 5 star hotel.  I have now stayed at the Cotton House and Edition, which on Marriott’s site, the Edition is a level higher.  The Cotton House is a much nicer hotel that feels like a 4.5+ hotel.  

My bigger issue is this sits in a very dangerous neighborhood in Barcelona.  We were robbed the first full day we stayed at the hotel.  Afterwards, doing some google searches, but talking with many of the hotel staff themselves, a lot of crime and robberies are happening within a block or two of the hotel.  My biggest complaint is the hotel takes no effort to warn people of this when they are checking in.  They should warn people to stay out of the gothic quarter and do not walk around with anything on them - no purses/bags, jewelry or watches.  We were robbed at 4pm.  They need to take guest safety more serious.",2,2022,12,28
41,Perfectly located and amazing staff!,"I booked The Barcelona EDITION because of the amazing location and I’m so glad I did.  It was in easy walking distance to my favorite spots, and I found new favorites exploring the area surrounding.  I was hopeful that my Marriott Ambassador status would score me a room upgrade, but I wasn’t so lucky.  I was however extremely happy with the room I received… comfortable and well appointed with nice details.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Due to a daily room credit of 50 euros I made sure to have a meal Bar Veraz everyday.  The bartender and staff gave great suggestions, so I happily put myself in their hands.

I look forward to staying there for my next visit to Barcelona!",5,2022,12,22
41,Modern hotel in central Barcelona,"Lovely modern hotel in great location. We were greeted with a glass of cava on arrival. Staff at the entrance and in reception very friendly and helpful. Room is on the small side but we didn’t spend much time in the room so it didn’t bother us. Housekeeping was prompt and efficient with turn down service each night.
Breakfast is a la carte, everything we tried was delicious. 
We tried the bar downstairs, The Punch Room on the first floor and the roof top bar, staff in all of them very friendly, happy to make whatever cocktails we wanted! 
Overall a lovely, modern, clean hotel in central Barcelona with super friendly staff, we would stay here again.",5,2022,12,21
41,"Definitely Will Return - Location, Service, Hotel, Food, Drinks","PreArrival: The hotel concierge and staff were in constant contact with me preparing for our first trip to Barcelona, it was wonderful. I cannot remember the 2 concierges that helped us, but they were really great. The doormen were very helpful as well.
Check In: We arrived early on a Thursday morning booked under the FHR through AmEx Platinum and were checked in right at noon. Alejandra was quick and so sweet upon check in, especially after our overnight flight. She made sure to put us on a high floor as requested and we were in a corner room. I was wonderful that she went over all of the benefits that went with our booking and thanked us for our Marriott status. 
Room: We didn't really hear all of the noise that others mentioned in their reviews and could have been because of the corner and high room. Our room was on the smaller end, but seemed so because there isn't much room to store luggage. The room was kept clean, except there is noticeable wear on the wood flooring in the entryway as some others have mentioned.
Restaurants:
We ate breakfast at the hotel every day, which came with the booking. Others have complained that this only includes 2 food items (and additional drinks), but this was way more than enough for one person and we were stuffed each morning. My absolute favorite was the Shakshuka - it was phenomenal!  The waitstaff was accommodating and ready for us every morning. 
After Hours Venues:
We stopped by the Roof one night prior to going out (it closed early at 10pm), but went to the Punch room 3 of the 4 nights we stayed there. It was such a fun vibe and the host there was awesome one night when it was really packed. Drinks were great and we spent all of our hotel credit there! We were bummed that the caberet wasn't open, but they said there was a lighting issue on the Friday we were supposed to go. 
Location: 
There could not be a better location, short walk to El Born, the Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas, Taxis were easy to catch and the metro is only a short walk. BONUS in December is that the largest Christmas market is just across the street. 
Post stay: 
Would recommend just to double check your bill prior to leaving, there was one breakfast that accidently got charged, but was taken care of immediately. Then when we got home realized not all of our credit was used and after speaking with Juan via email he was able to look into the issue and promptly issued a refund to my card.
",5,2022,12,20
41,Best Location in the City,"This hotel does has it all. The location is as good as it gets for a tourist. On the edge of El Born and Gothic but still walkable  ramblas (5 minutes) to Sagrada(20+) and even Guell(30+) but there is a taxi stand across the street if you want it also. The staff was super nice and helpful. i was traveling with my parents, wife and two young kids.",5,2022,12,18
41,Great choice for a place to stay!,4.8. The rooms are great and the staff is super helpful and friendly!  We loved the area because it had so many bars and restaurants very close by. The roof top bar was very nice and the staff went above and beyond to meet all of our needs!  Super easy to get a taxi or close enough to walk to so many places!,5,2022,12,04
41,Maravilla!,"I stayed 2 nights at The Barcelona EDITION celebrating my birthday. Everything was perfect thanks to the help of the staff - kind, attentive and professional.

Judith & Alexandra made memorable our stay, and the barmen at the bar were outstanding (unfortunately don’t remember their names). 

It was a real pleasure staying there!
Hope to see you soon,",5,2022,12,03
41,Exceptional Service Immaculate Property,"Beautiful property, wish we had more time to enjoy the hotel. Service was exceptional from the staff all over the property. Beautiful rooms, immaculate rooms. Needed more time there as we missed out on enjoying the rooftop. Definitely enjoy breakfast at the hotel. Worth every penny.",5,2022,11,27
41,Excellent Time at The Edition Barcelona,"I don't usually write reviews but this time I have to make an exception - I've stayed in Marriott hotels many times this year - but what I experienced last week in Barcelona topped it all. Firstly, the reception was extremely friendly and accommodating and all the staff - reception, service, housekeeping were super dedicated and friendly. But I would like to share one more example - where the difference between a good hotel and an extremely good hotel (like The Edition) becomes visible and comprehensible. We had planned to leave on Saturday morning - the hotel service brought the car and 2 bottles of water and 2 cereal bars were in the car, plus a personal letter from the reception team. I am already looking forward to the next time in Barcelona! Keep up the good work and good luck!",5,2022,11,24
41,"Not worth the money, also does not honor status or Amex platinum","4 star at best but was pretty disappointed overall about my stay. This also is the first Edition hotel for me and I’ll probably be staying elsewhere from now on, overall it is just not worth the price. If you’re going to pay 500 a night I’d recommend checking out some awesome Airbnbs in the area… way more worth it. 

Pros
- Excellent location in Gothic Quarter, makes exploring very convenient during the day.
- Great breakfast.
- Spacious shower, good AC, they fixed my clogged drain promptly.

Cons
- As lifetime platinum member AND having booked through Amex Platinum Fine Hotel Collections, you would think they’d try to upgrade me. Nope, they didn’t and they shrugged and claimed it was “first come first serve” but I’ve never had this happen in other places. 
- Booked the Santa Catarina room, and it was so small and dark, no sunlight and a tiny window. I can only imagine what the other more basic rooms are like, probably the size of a shoe box.
- The bed was very soft, if you prefer firmer beds this is not for you. 
- The whole hotel is just … so dark and I could barely see the hallway.",3,2022,11,24
41,Good Insider Eats from a Local,"We did the Gothic Quarter tour with Maribel, which was delightful-we had done our own research and been eating around the Born for a few days, but we would not have found 2 of the 3 restaurants without the tour-1 classic with fantastic oxtails and chorizo, 1 modern, which was a nice mix. Maribel was warm, knowledgeable, made sure our small, convival group was engaged with one another and the food. ",4,2022,11,11
41,Not worth it for Bonvoy Elite members,"Not the best for Marriott Elites. I wasn’t offered a welcome gift as Platinum member. No other benefits were explained. I made sure there was upgrade availability online and on the app prior to arrival. At check in I wasn’t offered an upgrade, just a higher floor even though I showed the receptionist the wide open availability. I asked what the welcome gift was in the morning and she said a small sweet. This was never delivered. There was no turn down service done or offered. The Bell service was superb, but the rest of the check in process and other services were terrible. I would look at other properties if your a Bonvoy member.",1,2022,10,25
41,The Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel.  Exceptional service.  The hotel is beautiful, great location in the city.  The top roof is a great experience.  The food is great. Everything is new and clean. We'll be back for sure.",5,2022,10,22
41,Fabulous hotel,"A close friend recommended this and we are so happy we stayed.  It’s a modern, beautifully appointed hotel with excellent service throughout.

The room was exceptional with wonderful bedding.

The bar and restaurant we superb in every aspect.

Breakfast offerings were amazing.

Rodriguez (server) was a joy to deal with.  If our daughters were here they would want to eat every meal here because he was so handsome.  

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Excellent location.  Safe neighborhood.",5,2022,10,17
41,AVOID - PAPER THIN WALLS AND VERY LOUD,"DO NOT stay here if you are looking for a quiet, peaceful stay. Unfortunately from the moment we got into our room I knew it was going to be a rough two days, and it absolutely was. I don’t know what rooms the people who left 5 star reviews were staying in, but on our floor the walls, ceilings, doors are paper thin. Without exaggerating, from the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out we heard every door slam, every footstep and stomp of the people above us, every small bang or chair moving. e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g., there was not a moment of more than a minute or so where we did not hear something banging or slamming. 

Not only that but when the door closed in the room next to us, our bed and headboard would shake. I’m in shock by the absolutely poor construction of this hotel with no thought of soundproofing whatsoever. Such a disappointment that for how much we paid for this hotel, we did not get a single moment of silence. We asked if we could switch rooms but the only other room they could offer us was the room directly next to us, so no difference and wouldn’t help with the noise issue.

Rooms were small, which we knew going into it, and clean. The staff were kind and helpful, but that is about the only pro I could think of. The poor soundproofing causing constant noise warrants this as a 1 star hotel, not a 5 star charging upwards of $500+ per night. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT STAY HERE unless you are ok with being kept up all day and night. This is my first and last time staying at an Edition property and I would never recommend it to anyone. If I could check out early, I would however they are unable to refund or cancel our reservation so we are stuck here for another day, ruining the last days of our trip.",1,2022,09,23
41,Crème de la crème,"Top of the line, 5 star hotel. From the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left, we were treated like royalty. 

We walked in after a tough travel day, the front desk and bell man were extremely accommodating. The hotel sent us cheesecake for our honeymoon with a hand written note from the Director of Customer Service Judit. The concierge Sebastian provided about an hour of service to plan our day for us. He smiled throughout, and planned the best day of our 3 week trip the Europe. The breakfast was amazing and the staff there is great. The woman who delivers room service is so nice. The bartender on the roof was understanding and kind. 

We asked to bell our bags for the day before we left and the whole staff jumped to help including Ore and Niko. 

The rooms are spacious and modern. The presentation is beautiful. Overall, it’s simply one of the best hotel experiences we’ve ever had.",5,2022,09,18
41,The Worst,"I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone would recommend this hotel, other than the location and friendly staff. The rooms are very W Hotel-ish, i.e. tiny. One can barely walk around, there is nowhere to put anything in the bathroom which has the worst lighting of any bathroom I have ever been in. The hallways and elevators are very dark and un-airconditioned. The bedroom air conditioning is a novel in itself. Never again!",2,2022,09,09
41,Great Option in Barcelona,Excellent hotel … the room was comfortable. The bed was wonderful . The location is very good  . The roof top area is superb - great food plenty of seating abs a small pool .. excellent view. One knock is that there are too many non guests at the roof top and they tend to take up the day beds,5,2022,09,03
41,"It's fine - good location, smallish rooms","We stayed for two nights.  Staff was fantastic and very accommodating.  The restaurant was decent.  That said, it's not like the Editon in Miami or NYC.  The rooftop pool is really a bar/lounge and is NOT for kids.  Unless you want bar patrons watching your kids in the glass pool.  For adults, I suppose it depends..

There is a traditional market next door, which is nice. Walking  distance to many of the sites, so very well located.",4,2022,08,28
41,Hotel is an absolute gem!,"This hotel is a absolute gem!! The moment we entered the hotel, we were greeted by the friendliest doorman and guided to the front desk. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The hotel has a delightful scent that complements the hotel’s decor. As we sipped on complementary flutes of cava, we finished our check in and requested restaurant ideas for dinner that night. He made reservations for us and we headed up to our room. Our room is large, clean and beautifully decorated with a modern touch. There was also a hand written note with delectable lemon tarts from the chef. The bathroom and shower is everything you want after a day of walking and sightseeing. This place is AMAZING!!",4,2022,08,26
41,Disappointing hotel with a lot of hypes,"Save your vacation from unpleasant surprise. Very disappointed with rooms and service. We were shocked how small the room was. There are hardly any drawers. Even though we had carry on luggages and only two it was very difficult to maneuver around the tiny room. Bathroom was even smaller one sink and hardly any space to even have the most basic necessities on the counter. They had rusty leaky old hose   Next to toilet for their version of bidet which did not work. And there were almost no place to hang the towels.  We were not able to use roof top restaurant or any of amenities as it appears they always have parties of some sort which the space is reserved and hotel guest can not access.  We discuss the issues with front desk and we promptly informed them we are checking out the next day. The manager assured us that he changed the check out date and there will be no additional charges. However the next day upon check out the day manager indicated that there were no notes or check out date were made on system and charge us an additional night. 
We were disappointed with room, lack of any window to open for slight fresh air. Rooms are very claustrophobic.
We gladly paid the extra night that we did not stay to just get out of the hotel as fast as possible. 
Do not recommend.",1,2022,07,26
41,Classy luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"This is our 2nd stay at The Barcelona EDITION, and we will continue to stay on future vacations. The hotel has sleek, modern beauty everywhere you look. The rooms are comfortable and will make you want to live here permanently. The property has 3 bar areas; we really enjoy their delicious cocktails at the rooftop, with a 360° view of Barcelona in an elegant setting. The hotel is central to major attractions and walk-able to the best restaurants and bars.

The most important reason to stay here is the welcoming staff and front of house manager Iñigo, who made us feel right at home. All the employees here are friendly and always looking for a way to make your stay better.

Until next time, Barcelona EDITION!",5,2022,07,23
41,"Avoid - some style, no substance","I stayed at the Barcelona Edition recently and was shocked at the small rooms, poor service, and limited amenities.

We booked our honeymoon here, as an Ambassador member, and the regular room we received was shockingly small, even compared to say New York City. Calling it a closet would be more fitting. Add to that the fact that we were across the hallway from a service entrance so constantly had noise out our door at all hours. Even little things that a hotel charging this much should do, like having water in a gym, was too much to ask of this sad hotel.

While the hotel makes for some instagrammable photos if you crop out the negative parts, there are FAR better options throughout Barcelona, including both Marriott and non-Marriott hotels alike.

I would avoid.",1,2022,07,19
41,Great location but...,"I spent two nights at the Edition at the end of my trip to Spain and while the hotel location is fantastic there is definitely areas for improvement.

Check-in was chaotic with the whole reception area filled with people either checking  in or checking out and staff struggling to cope with customers.  Coming in and out of the hotel during my stay this seemed like a regular occurrence and not the exception unfortunately.

My room was nice and comfortable with a look of understated luxury but it was small and had no views to speak of.  It was fine for me as I didn't intend to be spending much time in the room anyways.

The rooftop bar and pool while a nice idea were so busy that it was impossible to get a chair to sit down.  I think it's opened to non hotel guest and it seems to be very popular but i wouldn't plan to use it unless you are very patient.

There is a cocktail bar that's opened some night but while the place looked nice it was very quiet with very average cocktails.  There's definitely better cocktail bars nearby.  

Location is where this hotel shines, i was able to walk everywhere i wanted to which was great and certainly location is one of the reason i would come back to this hotel for.",3,2022,07,15
41,2nd stay at this property.,"A small modern hotel with interesting interior designs. The location is convenient and you can find a very good covered market next door, where you can get good breakfasts. I enjoyed the rooftop for drinks. The staff was very nice and helpful at the Front desk (the fact that I was easily upgraded to a suite was an added bonus).

This is now my hotel when I visit the city.",5,2022,07,12
41,Good but crowded and small hotel in good location.,"It’s a very busy hotel in a good location, the lobby and pool feel ore so busy and small they felt more like train stations than a relaxing luxury hotel. 

Good things:

The rooms are modern and stylish with good aircon and features (usb ports etc) along with good bathrooms. However the walls are thin (see below)

The overall design is nice. 

The food and service are excellent. Breakfast was great, pool food was really good. 

Alejandra at the front desk is great. She helped us with a reservation and it was amazing. She was the highlight. 

Bad things:

Rooms are noisy with thin walls, you can hear your neighbours and people in corridor. 

Pool area is too small and crowded. It was not relaxing at all. The pool itself is tiny and chilly. The pool level was not relaxing at all, plus one day they hired part of it out for a private function making it smaller and cramped. 

For a five star hotel, the front door was frequently unattended. Expect doormen to be honest.",4,2022,07,04
41,Didn't live up to the hype.,"I had great expectations and maybe too much so.  I booked with FHR and I'm a Titanium/Lifetime Platinum with Marriott.  I paid extra to book with FHR for the added amenities and the only one that really paid off was the noon check in which I think I would have got in either case. As far as Titanium recognition I was just congratulated and told they know how difficult that is to achieve.

The included FHR breakfast wasn't really all inclusive as you can pick one egg dish but they're à la carte. So if you order two eggs, that's all you get.  Potatoes or meat is extra and not included. You can get a side of fruit though included.  We ended up using our $100 welcome amenity mostly for breakfast (actually only 87€ when it should have been at least 93€).  For the life of me I'll never understand why they want to shortchange you on the conversion rate when they charge 5€ for a bottle of water.

Lastly the room was just too small. I got upgraded from a Superior room to a Deluxe room which basically isn't even an upgrade.  I couldn't even get the ""DELUXE SANTA CATERINA"" room showing available.  The hotel had a lot of inventory bookable online. The maintenance was also lacking, there were two bottles of bodywash for the shower and no shampoo... the sink faucet handle was falling off and there wasn't consistent hot water for the shower.

My stay wasn't much better than a three-star hotel.",3,2022,06,29
41,Extremely helpful staff and beautiful hotel,"My wife and I have been traveling through Europe and as we arrived at The Edition Barcelona, we realized that I had booked our stay for the following month 😫. Joel at the front desk had a nice laugh with us, gave us a drink and quickly got on the phone with his colleague Rocio in reservations. In short order, they had it sorted and Antonio showed us to our room. Joel made us a last minute reservation at Arcano Restaurant (Highly recommend this place!) and we were off to explore Barcelona. I highly recommend this hotel.  The property and its staff are to complemented.",5,2022,06,28
41,Not welcoming staff at all,"Visited this place with my friend during my vacation, I entered and wasn’t greeted by anyone had to figure out my own way to the pool and bar, took them almost an hour to take my order and right away the waiter informed me I can’t use the pool and the beds for tanning because they are for guests only… I had come all the way here to get some sun, a drink and refresh in the Pool, so they kept me in a corner with two chairs and took another hour to bring my drink which wasn’t even cold. The place is cute has a nice decor but unfortunately the staff didn’t seem to be happy at all with any guest… had one drink and left right away. Will not recommend at all.",1,2022,06,25
41,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel.,"Beautiful Hotel. I loved all the soft furnishings in the room, the amenities are some of the best I’ve seen in hotels. The bar and restaurant staff are very friendly and took great care. Front office and bell staff were spot on. Very friendly and hospitable.",5,2022,06,16
41,"Wanted to LOVE, but only LIKE","We spent 3 weeks in Europe this year; London, Paris, Barcelona and Madrid.  We spent the most time and money on our Barcelona portion.  We were excited to stay at The Barcelona EDITION.  I’m a Bonvoy Titanium Elite lifetime member, so I have traveled a lot and can be a bit picky.

They did recognize my status, which seems to be unusual in Europe.  I found the room quality to be average, but had more service failures than I expected.

Room Quality
EDITION hotels are high on style and design which I love.  However the two rooms I was in were a bit worn.  Love the hardwood floors, but scuffs, scratches and damage need regular attention.  They don’t appear to keeping up with the floors, so it gives a dirty/dingy feel.  Same can be said of the wood veneer wall panels.  Scratched up, peeling and chipped.

Rooms are really small, which is on me.  

Service Failures
Upon check in, I asked if I could get my Titanium upgrade.  It’s fine to be denied, but he said “You are staying too long to be upgraded.”  That seems rather offensive and counter-intuitive.  You have a member in high standing staying for 5 days and it’s too long to be considered for an upgrade?  Not very hospitable and not very customer centric.

On the 3rd morning of our stay, I was reviewing our reservation.  I discovered that we had a “Bed & Breakfast” rate.  No one explained how that worked when we checked in.  I reached out to guest services again and they confirmed that breakfast was included at the bar.  Just a little frustrating as we had been going to Starbucks around the corner for the past 2 days.  Would have been nice to have a more comprehensive check in based on our rate program.

We elected to pay for an upgrade for the last 3 days of our trip.  We confirmed the upgrade on the 13th, with the move scheduled on the 15th.  On the 15th asked about our room change and was told it would not be possible.  I shared the documented conversation “chat” where the move was confirmed. I don’t like to be a angry guest, but I was frustrated.  About an hour later they said they could move us, but then we had to rush to get moved before 12. Then the staff made sure to let me know that even though they were going to allow us to move, we would be expected to pay the additional $110 per night.  Duh, that’s what I agreed to when I made the arrangement.  Unnecessary attitude from the front desk woman.

To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  We were so excited to be at an EDITION hotel.  We’ve stayed at the NYC location before.  This hotel was a complete let down.  Poorly maintained and the attitude from some staff was disappointing.

I would say that the shining stars of service were Emilio and Enrique.  They did a great job of making us feel welcomed.  They are the reason it’s 2 stars and not 1.",2,2022,06,16
41,Great place to stay,"We moved here after our original hotel was not what we had hoped for.  Great move!  The hotel is great, staff was helpful and friendly, rooms were well appointed and you can't beat the roof top deck/bar!  Easy location to walk and cab from.  Also felt very safe there which i cannot say for many other parts of Barcelona now.",5,2022,06,03
41,A great few days,"We had a great time. 

From the first few steps in the hotel to the departure 3 days later, all the staff took great care of us. The facilities are modern, functional and well designed. Breakfast is varied and tasty. We didn't get to enjoy the rooftop terrasse since the weather wasnt good, but it is very welcoming. The punch room, in the first floor was a very nice stop, with tatsy cocktails and a very nice musical selection. 

The location is fantastic, with shops and restaurants nearby and in between the rambla and Barceloneta. It is definitely a place we are looking forward to come back to as soon as possible.",5,2022,06,02
41,Very disappointing,"This is definitely not a luxury hotel. I am  actually surprised that Marriott put their name to it.

 The rooms are tiny - hardly space for any luggage and the reception is very basic. We went out one day at 8am and when we returned at 5pm our room had not been made up.

The roof top 'restaurant' really isn't a restaurant as there are very few tables - you are supposed to eat dinner sitting on a couch. Breakfast service in the  lobby restaurant was rather disastrous. The staff were in chaos and we waited 20 mins just to get a cup of coffee - when our food came it was stone cold.

I realize in the big scheme of things that these are not maojr issues but the hotel is not cheap and if you want to charge the prices you need to deliver!",3,2022,06,01
41,"Great Gothic Quarter Hotel, Incredible Staff","Flying in from the states, we were tired upon arrival.  The front desk staff--and even the manager of the hotel--all made us feel welcome and were very attentive.  The staff happily stowed our bags and gladly retrieved them again when we realized we had forgotten something.  The  manager brought us some exquisite coffee and sat down with a map of the city to explain the lay of the land.  Later, after we had completed a bus tour, he could see that we were even more bushed and invited us to a table in the restaurant where the chef whipped up a local Catalonian dish for us to snack on while we waited for our room (potato chunks with two fabulous sauces) and fizzy waters.  Free, of course.  

They got us into our room 45 minutes before check-in, which was a pretty good trick, because I had booked one of the four top floor rooms with the veranda and the people in ours had opted for a late check out.  The room was throughly cleaned, according to COVID protocol and we were very pleased.

Those veranda rooms are great, by the way.  Ours had a kind of funny microwave tower in front of it, but the view was still great.  In fact, an odd, flat-topped cathedral was in view.  We got curious on our second day and visited it--Santa Maria del la Mer (Saint Mary of the Sea?) and it was fabulous.  Not sure we would've bothered if we hadn't seen it from the room!

The veranda had two chase lounges, a sofa and a table and chair set, along with some flowing vines.  Really great.  It faced east, too, toward the sea, which meant shade in the afternoon and evening.  Room was relatively small, but not bad for Europe.  And the appointments were top-shelf.  Nice bathroom, too.

The location is just feet from a cab stand which always seemed to have taxis waiting.  Taxis are efficient and very affordable in Barcelona, so I'd recommend using that.  The hotel staff is happy to reserve one for you, too.  This was helpful on getaway day, as we were transferring to the cruise terminal.  It's only a fifteen minute ride, FYI--very convenient.

You're also a block from the city's main cathedral and a fifteen minute walk through the heart of the Gothic Quarter to La Ramblas, the famous restaurant-filled street.  About a fifteen minute walk to the square where the two hop-on/hop-off buses start their routes. A fifteen minute taxi ride to the Sagrada Familia.  The Gothc Quarter is great to walk through and felt very safe, even at 10:30pm, when we were strolling back from a Flamenco Show on the La Ramblas.

We had dinner at the hotel one night, opting for an outdoor table.  The only negative I would add is that they have a public drop-off for recyclables in front of the hotel on the far side of a very wide pedestrian way.  It didn't smell, but it wasn't pretty.  But not the hotels' fault, of course.  On the other hand, you're also right next door to a cool market where you can get fresh fruit, meats and pastries.  There's an even better pastry shop in the street beyond the market!

My main takeaway from this place, though, was easily the service they gave us.  I'm a Marriott gold member, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it.  But I gotta' tell ya, we've stayed in LOTS of nice hotels over many years and the staff at this place was bested by no others.  They were at the very top of their game---one of themes accomodating I've ever experienced.  Thanks, gang!  We'll be back!",5,2022,05,31
41,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great location","It really was a lovely hotel placed right in the center of Barcelona, so easy walk to the beach and also to other sightseeing places. 
The Staff where great especially Front Desk, Juan and Concierge Yannick Garcia. They helped us with all inquires and tips on Barcelona.
The Hotel has the softest and most comfortable robes I have ever worn. Also all towels and the bedsheets are incredibly soft.
I would recommend staying here!",5,2022,05,25
41,"Wonderful Stay, Great Service, Fantastic Location","Booked a 6 night stay in May for my wife's birthday. When we arrived there was a mixup over our reservation, but the front desk staff (Inigo, Claudio and Joel) were very patient and once I'd got my reservation reconfirmed they found a nice Santa Catarina room for us with a view of the east side of the city and the coastline. 

The room was very clean, everything worked as expected - AC, USB ports, Wi-Fi, sound bar, etc. Bed was comfortable. Shower with rainforest setting was very refreshing. We had turndown service every night with 2 chilled bottles of water on the nightstands. 

Breakfast was a little slow but they were short staffed and being on vacation we were in no hurry anyway. We really enjoyed the rooftop bar. The views over the city are fabulous at night. It's popular with locals, so the staff always keep tables, sofas and loungers available for residents. 

Concierge were very helpful in booking restaurants and the hotel is ideally located for everything to see and do in the city. They even arranged for 'in room' covid tests the day before we left, the results for which were emailed to us within an hour.

I must say that everyone at the hotel from the front desk - who always recognized us and remembered our names -  to the breakfast room, doormen, concierge, Punch Room, maid service and rooftop bar (shout out to Nelson and his team) went out of their way to help. Service is outstanding and we will be back again later this year.",5,2022,05,24
41,WAY TOO MANY STARS FOR THIS PLACE,"We were a group of ten adults traveling together in April and our travel company, who otherwise did a superb job booked us in this supposedly five star hotel in Barcelona.  What a disappointment.

First, if you are looking for any Marriott recognition, forget it.  They are proud of the fact that they don't care what reward level Marriott Convoy has assigned to you.  Platinum Elite -- means nothing.

The problems started with our check-in a day earlier than the others.  There was one couple who was in front of us at the front desk and it took a full forty minutes for them to be done.  I could tell they weren't happy when they walked away.  We approached the desk and gave our name and reservation number.  He pulled their printout of our reservation and fooled around on the computer for quite some time before telling me that their computers were down, so he couldn't check me in.  I asked him why since he had all of the information on the printout and as a Bonvoy member, all of my information was available to them, including my credit card.  Finally after after several more minutes of back and forth, we were given our room key.

The next day the other four couples arrived.  The service at the front desk was again slow and trying to check-in the others took a very long time.  After the first two got checked in, they finally found a second person for the front desk.  We had reserved the Deluxe Santa Caterina rooms, which were three steps up from the basic room.  Not bad, but certain nothing special at all. The only difference between that and the basic room was a window seat that they had placed a couch in front of making it inaccessible.  One of the couples was assigned a Handicapped access room, which she had not requested and didn't want.  She was told no other rooms were available.  When she got to the room, the shower would not drain.  She got nowhere on the phone, so when she went down to the front desk in person, voila there was an other room available.

Two of the four couples had ordered breakfast with their room and paid a higher rate.  They refused to honor that until they were able to log in and print out their reservation confirmations which clearly showed that they had paid for breakfast in advance.  Tip if you do go ahead and book this hotel, which I would not recommend, just go next door to the Santa Caterina marketplace and their are wonderful authentic informal options available for a small fraction of what this hotel charges for breakfast.

The biggest fiasco of all was the morning we checked out and were moving on to Madrid.  We had private transportation coming at 8:00 and had told the front desk the night before that we would be down promptly at 7:30, their advertised opening time.  When no one was there nor would anyone from the front desk call and ask anyone, we finally loaded ourselves on the bus a couple of minutes before 8:00 with no breakfast even though it had been pre-paid for all ten of us.

They did send a review and all of this was included in the review.  Here is the salient portion of the GM's response directly from her e-mail:  

I have shared your feedback with the associates, and as a teachable moment, we have discussed our service standards and reviewed improvement opportunities in the service they provide. I am confident that these necessary steps will ensure your experience of staff service is an isolated incident.

I hope you choose to stay with us again, whenever your travels bring you back to the area.

I really don't care about her ""teachable moments"".  I do care about her failure to meaningfully address any of the issues raised.  Stay with them again?  Not a chance in hell.  Nowhere near what any reasonably experienced traveler would expect at a five star hotel.

Out of some sense of fairness, the concierge and bell services were absolutely superb, but that's not enough for a hotel that claims to be five star.",1,2022,05,21
41,The Barcelona Edition by Marriott is in class!,"I am a lifetime Titanium Elite Member of Marriott. In the last thirteen years I have stayed in hundreds of Marriott locations for a total of 1,472 nights. 

My wife and I traveled to Barcelona Spain in May 2022 and have decided to stay two nights at The Barcelona Edition by Marriott.  The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. 

The following employees went over and beyond to help make our stay the most enjoyable.  

Sergio Plana, Receptionist
Joel Almeyda, Receptionist
Roberto Fajardo, Bellman

The Barcelona Edition by Marriott is one of the best properties I’ve ever had the privileged to stay at.  I highly recommend this Marriott property for anyone visiting downtown Barcelona located at Avinguda de Francesc Cambo 14, Barcelona, 08003, Spain.",5,2022,05,09
41,Vacation,This is a beautiful hotel with great service! The front desk employees where great and a special thanks to Martin. He is very knowledgeable about the area and had great recommendations for places to eat and see. If you need assistance make sure to ask Martin. He will spend time with you to answer all of your questions about Barcelona.,5,2022,04,21
41,The best experience!,"I stayed here with my family for five days. The location is perfect, the rooms are really nice, and the staff is amazing. In every area of the hotel, they go above and beyond to assist. I felt safe and comfortable there, and they made it feel like home.",5,2022,04,15
41,If you are looking for hip and expensive place to stay book it!,"So we stayed here and the Le Meridian, I feel Le Meridian has a much better value! It’s only 500 meters apart! Both hotels are part of the Marriott rewards program!
Here is what I liked here at Edition, it’s clean, new, loved the body wash!
Here is what I did Not like, I could not get the room temperature below 24, sometimes the room was 25! The Wifi speaker was impossible to connect to, the USB ports did not work in the room, towels were not soft almost like sand paper, housekeeping did not clean our room the first day till 5 pm this is after calling twice, the breakfast spot was overwhelmed and short staffed, it took 20 minutes to get a coffee the first day, we were given a broken umbrella to use the first day, the rooms are very small and the fragrance pumped into this hotel was extremely strong! This was my first Edition Hotel booking, probably my last too!",3,2022,04,05
41,Highly recommended!  Well located luxury hotel,"We really liked this hotel.   The location is great, very near the Cathedral and the Gothic Quarter and Port area.  The staff is extremely attentive and the concierge efficient and helpful.  Our room was generously sized with a King bed and sitting area along the large window.  It was near the street (3rd floor) but well insulated from the street sounds.   The lobby bar and restaurant are a great place to gather and the bar staff are great.  There is a roof deck and restaurant that has a beautiful view and very nice bar - strangely none of the staff even mentioned this and we found it on our own.  They “buried the lead” for sure.  There is also a fun bar, the “Punch Room” on the mezzanine which stays open late and has a clubby feel.  Highly recommend this place!",4,2022,02,24
41,Very welcoming,"We stayed at the Barcelona Edition Hotel for 2 days as a birthday trip to celebrate our daughter’s 30th birthday. Prior to our arrival I contacted the hotel to arrange a special treat for our daughter to welcome her. Communication was excellent and I must thank Rodrigo for this. The hotel staff could not have been more warm and friendly upon our arrival. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome at all times. The location of the hotel was very central and excellent for La Ramblas which was within walking distance. We were given 2 interlinking rooms which was lovely. The bed itself was rather soft for our liking, and we did have to ask for firmer pillows, but everything we asked for was delivered to our room very swiftly. We could not fault the service anywhere in the hotel. We’d like to especially mention Rodrigo, Claudia, Judith and Martin for the exceptional service they provided during our stay - they truly made our visit special. We will most definitely return.",5,2022,02,13
41,Highly recommend,"Fabulous short stay. Excellent service, great location, super comfortable room. Roof dining experience was awesome. Shoutout to Sergio at the front desk for attentive service. Highly recommend, excellent quality and value. 5 star chic.",5,2022,01,30
41,Luxury Stay In the Heart of Sant Pere!,"We are so lucky to have stayed here during the winter holiday season in 2021! From the time we checked in until checked out, the staff tended to our every need.  Iñigo upgraded us to an incredible loft suite room, complete with an enormous bathtub, which made every day feel like our own personal spa.  Judith left a handwritten note welcoming us personally.  

When I asked for a few tea bags to be brought up to the room, they arranged for an entire tea service, complete with baked treats and honey! They also brought us a dessert to celebrate a holiday! 

The hotel felt incredibly luxe and the room itself is one of my favorite hotel rooms ever!

Thank you to Iñigo, Juan, Andres, and everyone that made our stay so incredibly special! We cannot wait to be back!",5,2022,01,29
41,Great service and beautiful room,"Had a quick stay here at the end of my Spain trip and enjoyed the experience. Hotel got my reservation date wrong but was able to resolve it quickly and put me in a relatively spacious room. Luxurious robe, bedding, and amenities in the room, and lovely bay window with a view to the city. Also enjoyed a great breakfast here but I wouldn’t recommend buying it in advance like I did. They have a great breakfast menu, and it would cost less just to order at the restaurant. 

Hotel is located away from the main road so most taxi’s won’t stop right in front of it. Special shout-out to Yannick who was extremely attentive to incoming guests; he spotted me getting off the taxi across the street and was able to help me with my luggage. 10/10 for service! 

It’s not a big property but nicely decorated; to me the neighborhood was slightly ghetto compared to when I stayed around Diagonal but it’s very central. 

A great place to stay if you have a little extra to spend on accommodation.",5,2021,12,25
41,"Amazing Stay, Excellence in Service","I enjoyed staying at the Barcelona EDITION Hotel during my business travel.  The Hotel is Modern Luxury, and the sense of arrival was felt from the minute I walked through the door.  I was greeted and made genuinely welcomed by Martin and Clara at the front desk.  I arrived on an overnight flight and was accommodated immediately and escorted to my room. Giorgio Ciottoli (concierge) has a strong pulse on authentic recommendations indicative of the location (thank you). The hotel provides morning breakfast as I have experienced, and I was greeted by Leonora, Benjamin & Andrea every morning. The hotel Bar was buzzing with guests and locals, and the service was made complete by the bartender Carlos.  Thank you for a wonderful stay!!! ",5,2021,12,02
41,Excellent Location,"Our first time in Barcelona and our friends recommended the Edition as the location was good for sightseeing.

Great welcome and pleasant staff throughout. The room was small but well decorated and very comfortable. A lovely clean modern bathroom with amazing fluffy bath robes and towels. The room was quiet with very good double glazing.
Important to us is the temperature control which worked and we were able to keep the room cool. The location proved to be perfect for us. We walked to all the tourist sights and the places we wanted to eat were all nearby. The gym was small but adequate and the breakfast was excellent, though the service on one day was a bit slow as it was so busy. The staff were lovely though. We had an early dinner er one night which was great too. The lobby bar was bustling and serves excellent cocktails.

We would definitely come back here when we return to Barcelona.",5,2021,11,19
41,Avoid if you’re expecting service,"Huge disappointment.  Would encourage others to avoid. The location and facilities are fine but the staff was very disappointing. Completely ignored when entered the hotel, told to wait just standing there while the front stapled papers, and when a family came in after me the staff looked past me, welcomed them and offered them drinks. I spoke up and asked what was going on and was again ignored by the male concierge! Refused to look at me and waved me aside. The general manager came to my assistance but clearly this is not the service I expect from a supposed top tier hotel. I won't be staying here again and recommend other stay at the Mandarin Oriental close by where the service was up to par.",1,2021,11,13
41,A memorable holiday at The Barcelona Edition,"I had an exceptional stay at The Barcelona Editiom. From the time that I walked in Inigo Azcorra, Front House Manager warmly welcomed me enthusiastically and anytime there after when he would see me. He made sure that I well taken care of. The entire week long stay Inigo, Tony, Jojo and of course Raydell made sure that I wanted for nothing. They went above and beyond. Exceeding all expectations. 

My corner unit suite was absolutely beautiful. More importantly it was very clean. The bed very was comfortable. They style was modern
and chic. 

Thank you all for making my stay a memorable one.",5,2021,11,11
41,Truly ONE OF A KIND Experience at the Barcelona EDITION with the BEST Staff!,"I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel and its staff. My husband and I were visiting for our wedding anniversary, and we were made to feel so special by everyone we came in contact with. From the very first interaction and welcome from Judith (Head of Guest Experience) we felt like true VIPs. Martin in the lobby was so warm and kind. He always ensured we knew where we were going and had the transportation to get there. Giorgio, the concierge, truly made our trip. He handled all of our reservations and his recommendations were SO spot on! It was some of the best food we had during our entire trip to Spain and I'm not sure we would have found these places without him! He also made sure we were able to get into a night club (for our favorite night out of the trip) and helped us pick a spa for the most relaxing anniversary day. It's one thing to have a beautiful hotel (which they do!), but the staff here are truly the shining stars! Thank you everyone for the most memorable experience. One we will never forget :)",5,2021,11,02
41,EDITION hotel Barcelona,"The hotel was excellent, conveniently located. But what makes this hotel a must stay is the staff!!! From the doorman to the front desk, to the bar/restaurant staff. All could not be more accommodating. And always with a pleasant smile!

Absolutely would stay here again and again!",5,2021,10,17
41,One of a kind experience,Tony Alvarez and the entire team made my first stay in Barcelona and at the sedition hotel a one of a kind experience.

41,Combined business + pleasure stay,"Elegant, sophisticated hotel with professional staff, particularly the hotel’s gracious and charming Head of Guest Experience, Judith.  She listened to my requests, accommodated my needs, and provided me with area recommendations to make my 10-day stay in Barcelona both comfortable and enjoyable. Thanks, Judith! -Romeo",5,2021,10,13
41,Beautiful and lovely,"The warmth of their hospitality feels right as soon as we arrived. Very welcoming from Yannick the bellman and smooth  check in process by the front desk. We were so lucky to get upgraded to a deluxe room, such a beautiful room! Of course we love the scent all over the EDITION hotel brand. Great cocktails at the rooftop, we went back there every night during our stay. Best of all, the leadership team are super friendly too, we had the pleasure meeting Iñigo and Julie. They helped to organize with the concierge, Rodrigo for tickets to visit Sagrada Familia. Great restaurant recommendations too! Oh, they serve delicious shakshuka and eggs benedicts in Bar Veraz the restaurant.
Thank you for being amazing! We had a wonderful time in Barcelona 💕",5,2021,09,29
41,Tiny Room - Told No Upgrade spite seeing it available on booking - Comfy Beds - Great Location,"This is our last time for our first trip to Europe after 2 years hiatus because of the pandemic. I had so many people recommend this hotel as one of the best in Barcelona. The staff has been friendly and the rooftop is very lovely, but the room is the size of a shoebox. As an Amex platinum member, I usually receive an upgrade as is, as well as always ask. They said no and that none were available spite when originally booking just yesterday I saw that bigger rooms were available for my dates. My boyfriend and I cannot even maneuver around the bed and based on the map we have the smallest room the hotel even offers. The bed is very comfy but the room is so loud. We can constantly hear people in the hall and movement above us, as if it’s a motel. The view is just industrial buildings as well with sunlight coming in even with my OCD-level attempt at sealing the curtains. I’m really disappointed as I bit the bullet to spend a hefty amount to stay here and was expecting a lot more. However, we have 2 days left and I won’t let it ruin the last days of my 2 week trip, just was hoping for something better and at the level of what I paid for. Very comfy robes and treats delivered.",3,2021,09,24
41,"Could be Better, Especially for Marriott Elite Members","To summarize: I share what the other reviewer Dewon R wrote in saying that the hotel is NOT Marriott loyalist friendly. As a guy who spends 150-200 nights a year in Marriott properties, I've seen and experienced it all - from the lowliest Moxys and Alofts to the St. Regis, Ws, and Ritzes. So let me be honest in saying that the Edition was underwhelming at best if you're used to the usual VIP treatment at any other Marriott property. 

To be fair, it wasn't all bad, here's an honest, objective breakdown:

Pros:

- Modern, new, great view. Rooms have nice finishing.
- Nice rooftop bar with some select seats for in-houseguests.
- Friendly staff who try their best and are helpful.
- The interior design is like a grayer color palette of the W.

Cons:

- No breakfast (first time in 10 years as a Titanium member that I was not given any).
- No lounge to compensate for the loss of said breakfast ^
- Not a big room upgrade (first time in a decade I didn't get a suite as a Titanium).
- Someone woke me up from a nap in the afternoon to 'check the minibar' and didn't even apologize when I told them I was taking a siesta.
- Atmosphere can be a bit pretentious. AKA: kind of people who do things 'for the gram' probably like this place.

I've stayed at many hotels in Barcelona and preferred Le Meridien and even the Renaissance over this one. Sure, they're not as trendy, but not only more centrally located but offer way more despite being having the price.

But above all, my main problem with this property is of they don't want to recognize Marriott brand loyalists and Elite members, then why be part of the Marriott chain in the first place? Just stay independent.",3,2021,09,05
41,Amazing Service ,"Great Hotel Location and Outstanding Staff and Service. 
 I would especially like to recognize Mr  Munir Viñas..
I had left my wallet in room and ìt was found a day later but I was at the Westin in Valencia.. 300 + KM
Mr Viñas volunteered to take the train to Valencia to return wallet.. as we would be going to Croatia in 48 hours.

Muchas Gracia to all at EDITION and Westim",5,2021,09,03
41,Overpriced and NOT for Bonvoy Elie Members,"My partner and I were so excited to stay at this new hotel as the finale to our amazing weeklong trip exploring Spain. With the price per night close to 250 Euro for a basic room, we expected a lot (especially given that I am a Lifetime Platinum Bonvoy member).

Sadly, we were disappointed and actually checked out early and switched to the Le Meridian after 2 nights, where we received the type of service and benefits, I am accustomed to for Platinum Elite members (complimentary breakfast and huge suite upgrade).

Let’s start with the Pros:
- Very modern new hotel. With great finishes
- Staff are all impeccably dressed
- The Rooftop is beautiful- amazing views of the city. Good drinks and food
- Breakfast was delicious
- They sent me a delicious chocolate dessert as they knew we celebrating my belated birthday
- Great location and great products in the bathroom (Le Labo)

And now the cons:
- This hotel is not for you if you are an Elite Bonvoy member. You do not get breakfast as a benefit. We were offered the “special price” of 19 Euro each for breakfast. We decided to try it out on our last day there. While very delicious, upon checkout, they tried to charge me 68 Euro for breakfast! This was resolved eventually.
- For the price you pay per night here, I was underwhelmed. The room is tiny, although modern. I was told I was “upgraded”- the upgrade was basically the same room with a couch at the window. And the view from the couch? 3 giant trashcans. Very disappointing
- There is very minimal closet space. No bedside drawers for storage. 2 of the drawers in the closet were occupied with bar items for purchase which I had to empty and use for clothes. The bed is also very Soft- if you like firm beds or accustomed to Marriott’s heavenly beds, be warned. Also, after about 5 failed requests for “firm pillows”, we were finally sent what they called their firmest pillows, which were honestly subpar- we had to use the throw pillows from the couch to get some neck support.
- When we tried to check out early due to our unhappiness, we were told we would be charged an extra night- so we were forced to stray an extra night. Upon arriving back in New York, I noticed that the tip we left on the rooftop bar the first day was charged as 14 Euro, instead of the 4 Euro which I distinctly remember leaving as the tip on the receipt- very sketchy. I did not complain, as it is totally not worth it.
- The bar has great views and great food and drinks but honestly is way overpriced.
- After spending over 650 Euros for 2 nights at this hotel, I was only credited 2500 Bonvoy points for this stay which definitely seemed incorrect. When I contacted Bonvoy customer services about it, they immediately adjusted it to the correct amount of over 10,000 points.

Overall, we were very disappointed. If you want a modern hotel and don’t care about things like Elite benefits, storage for your clothes or sleeping comfort, then go for it. I do not think this hotel compares remotely to other 5-star Marriott hotels we stayed at during this Spain vacation (Maria Cristina in San Sebastien; Hotel Marqués de Riscal in El Ciego; Le Meridian in Barcelona).
Our next stay at Barcelona, we will stick to the Le Meridian for sure!",2,2021,08,07
41,Beautiful Hotel Near the Gothic Quarter,We had an amazing stay at The Barcelona EDITION! The COVID protocols were just right and they shared so much information about the wonderful city. We were able to enjoy both breakfast and dinner at Bar Veraz as well as an afternoon at the rooftop pool - highly recommend both! Thank you Inigo Roy for your team’s exceptional work!,5,2021,08,03
41,"Wonderful service, rooftop and food!","This hotel offers everything they promised. I really recommend this hotel when staying in Barcelona. I stayed for 3 nights and the service is out of this world, the staff is very nice and helpful. 
The breakfast is amazing and so is the incredible Rooftop of the hotel. The only minus was that all orders on the rooftop took some time even at times when there are not many guests there. 
The bedrooms and bathrooms are very nice and the best thing is the Air condition which is completely silent.
The quality and the nice people working here made me love my stay here.",5,2021,08,03
41,The best Hotel I’ve ever been!,"Top service, incredibly stylish and cozy. Oriol at the front desk was by far the best. Always kind, interested and had the best restaurant recommendations. I still dream of the house fragrance! Unfortunately, the coffee and the food at breakfast wasn't quite what I expected in a house of this standard, but the friendliness and openness of the service made everything up for it! We will come again!",5,2021,07,19
41,Just Perfect!,"What a wonderful stay we had at the Edition. We first had a room with terrace that was so pretty and comfortable. We had breakfast included with our rate and a lovely room it was, The rooftop bar was the high point for an evening wine.....

But the best part of our stay was the incredible staff... so welcoming and attentive.  We loved the whole experience so much we ended up booking an additional 2 nights, our room was not available so we ended up in a very pretty suite.

This hotel is located near the old town, and a great location for exploring this beautiful city and local tapas bars.",5,2021,07,05
41,Well done luxury hotel,"The hotel is really beautiful and well appointed. It has a stunning aesthetic, great customer service and an amazing location. 

From check in to check out, I felt like the staff was well trained and engaged in our service experience. We rarely if ever heard the word ""no"" and we felt like we were in a luxurious 5-star experience. 

I did not love the room layout (it was just small for the price in my opinion) so I suppose that's my only critique. Also the window seat was a bit flimsy and not really functional. But other than that, its' hard to find much to complain about with the hotel.",5,2021,06,23
41,Every Detail,"I have waited FAR long too long to write this review but that is where quarantine has helped - I have time!

So to cut to the chase, we have been back to Europe twice, stayed in Autograph collection hotels and other upscale Marriott properties. None have achieved the superb combination of location, staff, cleanliness, food, drink and attention to EVERY detail as the Barcelona Edition. El Born District is perfect. I spent a night on Las Ramblas at the Meridien prior to my wife joining me at the Barcelona Edition. I can tell you that Las Ramblas is something not to miss however for an unforgettable taste of Catalonia I would recommend El Born district. Just the morning espresso and evening cocktails enjoyed on The Roof that overlooks this colorfully alive part of the city, make it all worth it.

The staff. I wish I could remember all their names. Every one of them seemed like a friend and familiar face after the 5 days we spent there. Funny story, one morning I spilled coffee on my wife on The Roof. Within minutes of retreating back to our room a staff member politely followed up and made sure my wife was fine and offered to take her clothes immediately to the cleaners. One of dozen examples of excellent, personal, above and beyond service.

Do not miss the punch room! I never could find it so on day three I asked for assistance. It's actually very well hidden. The cocktails and local Catalan bar tenders were such a joy.

Our room was always cleaned when convenient for us. No annoying knocks at the door at inopportune times. Upon returning you could tell someone concerned with fine details and personalized service had tended to our room.

Suffice it to say we can not wait to return to one of our favorite European cities and definitely our favorite hotel.

Thanks for everything!

41,Great location!,"We had an enjoyable stay at the Edition, however, it was a slightly disappointing start.

We arrived late morning and had a reservation for two rooms. I am fully aware that we were ahead of the 15:00 check in, but we asked staff if there was any chance we could check in earlier, even if it was for just one of the rooms. They told us that they would try their best and get in touch if we could check in earlier. We told them that we would sit at the hotel’s restaurant and confirmed contact numbers so they could reach us easily. I had walked past reception a number of times between that time and 15:00 but the check in agent did not mention anything about a room being available at any point and I therefore assumed that it was simply not possible to check in early.  We proceeded to have lunch at the hotel restaurant. When I went up to reception at 15:00 and asked for our room keys I was given the room key to only one room. I explained that we booked two rooms. The associate acknowledged that and said that the other room had already checked in early. I informed her that that was not the case and that we were still waiting for both rooms. She then found the second set of room keys and said that her colleague would have tried to contact us but wasn’t able to get hold of us. That might have been the case but considering the fact that we hadn’t left the grounds and had made ourselves clearly visible to the staff at all times, it was extremely disappointing that a little more effort was not made. It would have started our trip on a much higher note.

Overall, the hotel was lovely. The rooms feel new and looked after. The overall decor is on the dark side with little natural light in the corridors. The rooms have big comfortable showers and our room had a lovely little sitting area by the bay window overlooking the front of the hotel.

Location wise, the hotel is perfectly situated for easy walking access to all of central Barcelona’s sights. It is next door to the Santa Caterina market as well as plenty of restaurants to dine at. The hotel’s rooftop restaurant has fantastic views but seating is limited and it gets very busy. The small plunge pool is more for effect than swimming but no doubt makes for a good cool down during the hot summer days.

Breakfast, served at Bar Veraz was great. It is served a la carte and for inclusive rates, you can have anything you want. Everything was served freshly and to order.

The only other thing that we struggled with, and I imagine this was more a technological issue, is that whenever I used the Marriott app to request something for the room, always stating the room number, by default it was always delivered to the main room on the reservation rather than the room I specified in my request. It was no big deal as we had rooms next to each other, however, I didn’t know that things were being delivered there.

Overall, it was a good stay. Barcelona has a plethora of great hotels and although I would consider returning to the Edition, I would also be happy to explore other options.

41,Lovely hotel in Barcelona,"stayed here for a few nights during my last visit to Barcelona and enjoyed my stay.

nice clean and modern rooms - best bit was the le labo toiletries!!

I found the rooms quite small which I didn't really enjoy (we travel internationally so we end up bringing larger luggages instead of small carry on sizes) and found the room to be cramped having two large suitcases in the room

great view for the rooftop

breakfast is nice",4,2020,03,09
41,Barcelona 💖,"Nature meets modern.
Outstanding views from the rooftop where I had my morning tea.  The Edition hotel is located in upscale el Born neighbourhood. Surrounded by a lot of shops. Unfprtunately I was travelling to work so I didn't try a lot of wines.
We tried their restaurant for two night and food was nice, fresh and healthy.
I liked my gold mirror in the room:)

Thank you. ",4,2020,03,08
41,Can’t say enough good things!,I am in the middle of my stay and have been blown away by the staff. They have gone above and beyond to provide us with excellent service. I honestly can’t believe the things they have done for us. Tony Alvarez has gone out of his way to make sure we were pleased following a noise complaint. Anna changed our room to make sure we wouldn’t have the experience again. Seriously the best hotel stay ever! Thank you Edition team for making this a memorable vacation for my wife and I.,5,2020,02,27
41,Fun with son,This hotel has the nicest staff.  Everyone says hello opens the door for you and are very kind.  When I go back to Barcelona I will stay here again.  In addition to having the nicest staff.  They are a very good location.  Minutes to walk to La Rambla and Plaça Catalunya.    What a wonderful experience for my first time in Barcelona with my son.,5,2020,02,24
41,My experience at The Barcelona Edition,"I am a single, 30’s something, health and fitness conscious well travelled woman, familiar with many of the luxury hotels in Europe. 

I recently discovered the Barcelona Edition Hôtel.
I loved it. It is nature meets modern. Walnut walls and neutral sleek architecitural furniture. Thoughtful window benches in many of the rooms, great for reading and watching the passing parade. 

The Edition Hôtel is located in the trendy upscale El Born neighbourhood. A fabulous walking area with many shops. 

Bar Verez is the hotel’s informal restaurant,  opening at 7am daily, and serving market fresh produce for breakfast lunch and dinner. The food is healthy and nutritious. 

The unique Punch Room serves daily free bespoke alcoholic beverages for its guests to sample. A great place to socialize and meet new people. 
What also makes this hotel unique is their free weekend entertainment. They had cabarat during my stay.

The staff never sit. They are always on their feet trying to help you.  They are incredibly attentive. 

Thank you manager, Tony Alvarez, for the  memorable experience. I will be a returning guest.

41,Outstanding staff!,"This BonVoy five star has a terrific location next to St. Caterina Market in El Born. 
It has an wonderful bar-restaurant in the lobby and the required roof-top bar. The breakfast is superior! 
The ambience is lovely. 
My upgrade to superior room was Ian Schrager inspired—minimalist. 
We arrived and were greeted by a warm, hospitable staff that remained helpful throughout our stay. 
My four star rating is because of room size and lack of storage not because of staff or presentation, which are outstanding. ",4,2020,02,11
41,"Wonderful Staff, Location and the Amazing Roof Top Bar","My wife and I recently returned home after spending two weeks in Spain. Our week in Barcelona at the Barcelona Edition was AMAZING!

We immediately felt at home.  Also, such a great location - we walked to all the dinners, tours, etc.  Highly suggest and we give it 5 stars!!",5,2020,02,08

41,Amazing hotel and incredible staff,"Stayed for four nights at this hotel. Wasn’t sure what to expect but was blown away by the service levels of the staff. The two ladies at front desk who checked me in at 730am were beyond helpful and friendly. The doormen never failed to assist with questions and say hello every time I went in and out. The concierge were also super helpful with directions and restaurants. The room attendants were so on top of cleaning my room that I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone in barcelona for comfort, convenience and excellent service. Is located by subway, hop on hop off bus and beside market with great fresh food and great little restaurants. Cannot wait to go back again and this hotel will be my go to hotel.

And housekeeping has a wonderful attention to detail, my room was always perfect!
Thank you very much, I will come back!

41,The staff make this hotel great!,"We spent the new year here. The receptionist Katia was super helpful. She even personally looked for my daughter at the roof top to deliver a small new year gift to my daughter, which made my daughter super happy and had a memorable stay. All other staff were friendly and helpful, including those in the restaurant.

The hotel room is nicely decorated, boutique feel, just a bit small compared to other hotels we have stayed in Spain. The bathroom size is big though, which makes the ratio a bit uneven with the bed area. The location is great, super close to a market, Barcelona cathedral, Picasso museum, Gothic quarter, etc. Taxi from this hotel to Park Guell costs about €10.

The rooftop bar is nice during day or night, I found the service at the bar was a bit slow during my two visits there. For a better view, I recommend the roof top bar at the nearby Colon hotel, where you get a nice view of the cathedral. 

Breakfast was included in our booking, got to choose an ala carte dish and a drink, and buffet selection of bread, fruits, cold cuts, etc. The ala carte dishes were very good (had the egg Benedict and Shakahuka).",5,2020,01,25
41,Staff was amazing,"In Response to the GM Lorena Reaching out to us to check in once we got back to the US. My Wife's Iphone was stolen 3 blocks from the hotel right out of her hand...but the staff was amazing and did everything they could to provide comfort.

I travel all over the US- Chicago, NYC, Boston, Tampa, LA, Philadelphia, DC, Atlanta, Ft Lauderdale to name some of the places and 95% of the time stay at Marriott Properties. As a family, we have vacationed at Marriott's in Hilton Head, Charleston, Myrtle Beach and NYC to give  you some perspective of my next statements. This was our first trip to Europe/Spain and we had just come from Madrid (Non-Marriott)

With that said, your team exemplified what it means to take care of a customer and go above and beyond the call of duty. They treated us like family the entire time and when Tricia's Iphone was stolen all jumped into action like a well oiled Machine- as a team. One was talking to Security, Security guy was on his microphone within seconds doing recon,  one was helping with Verizon, one was getting us wine (the same one who drew us the Sagrada Familia which we will never forget) and so on and so forth. Our needs at that time were completely met. They dropped everything else for us. What was a horrible situation turned into one we will never forget in a positive light. They brought tears to both of our eyes when they presented us with the artwork. Feel free to have anyone from Marriott worldwide or Corp call me- 704- 621-1002. I am staying at another Marriott in Tampa, FL Thursday night. Your staff the entire time was superb as we speak very little Spanish but Saturday night was beyond what we could have ever expected. 

Thanks for reaching out but please share this with your staff. We plan on coming back to Barcelona in the future and will definitely stay there. We will have phones attached with chains. :) You are all lucky to live in such a magnificent and enchanting city. 

Sincerely, 

Johnny and Tricia Vaughan",5,2020,01,22
41,"Great location, great rooftop","Fantastic location by the gothic quarter with lots of places to walk to nearby. Metro, bus and taxi options also all just outside the hotel, and a little kids playground outside if you have a little one that needs to burn some energy. The rooftop terrace has amazing views (+ plunge pool) and a bar for drinks.

You don’t get breakfast included with Marriott platinum loyalty, which is a shame and the rooms are on the small side (though that’s not uncommon in Europe),but otherwise everyone is friendly and helpful.  Check-in was slow on my stay but hopefully just a one off issue. 

Would recommend for the location and rooftop alone if you can find a good price (we stayed 3 nights on points).",4,2020,01,11
41,Awesome Hotel and Service,I usually stay at the W in Barcelona but this time I took a risk and stayed at the Edition Hotel. The service at this hotel is exceptional. The service on the 1st floor restaurant and bar was outstanding. Nicholas the bartender was extremely nice and helpful with recommendations that were outstanding. His pleasant personality made it enjoy able to have drinks at the bar. Breakfast in the morning Micela was amazing. Her positive attitude just made everyone around happy. Her dedication to making sure you are happy with everything had or wanted for breakfast was just outstanding. All the staff was very very good. It was a very pleasant experience.,5,2020,01,10

I had contacted them in advance letting them know that we were planning to visit for our honeymoon to see if there was anything special they could do to surprise my wife.  They requested a photo from us but didn't explain why.  I sent in a photo of us dancing on our wedding night, and they surprised us with a hand-drawn adaptation of the photo designed as if we were flamenco dancers.  It was so thoughtful, impressive, and above and beyond what we expected.",5,2020,01,03
41,Fantastic staff - highly recommended!,"Even if you choose not to stay here, the rooftop bar is a must. It offers a panoramic view of the city with a number of seating options both indoors and outdoors. Reservations highly recommended during peak tourist season. 

We stayed five nights in standard king room that overlooked the street in front of the hotel.  Street noise was no issue as the windows had double glazing, as well as automatic privacy and blackout blinds. 

If indulgence is your thing, room service is 24/7, and the room itself has plenty of extras such as a well stocked mini bar, various accessory kits, and a variety of snacks. (Be sure to check the drawer beneath the fridge!). Turndown service is also offered. 

The staff were attentive and friendly, and really made an effort to accommodate our every need, to include bringing up a meal we ordered via a food delivery app.  The hotel food was top notch, from the restaurant downstairs as well as the room service. There are also three bars all with different vibes and closing times. 

The location is within walking distance to Eixample, Las Ramblas, the beach, and more. It was a great place to stay during Christmas with plenty of shops and attractions open. 

Would certainly stay again!

41,Amazing hotel made even better by an AWESOME staff,"(Our thank you note to the Edition GM should say it all!)

Edwin: 

We don’t take the time often enough to write and commend great service. I can’t begin to tell you how exceptionally wonderful our (two) stays have been at your Barcelona property. We stayed for several nights at the beginning of a two week trip to Spain and France - and then cut out trip in France short, just to come back to Barcelona so we could stay a couple of more nights at the Edition. 

From a property standpoint, everything was extremely comfortable and well-appointed. Loved the design and decor and the room was fantastic. But what made our visit truly amazing were your people - we could single out Taya at Bar Veraz, Claudia and Munir at reception, Daniella at the top floor bar - and Cristina in reservations. All were wonderfully welcoming and warm and felt truly like immediate friends to us. We could hardly close our room door without a kind gift arriving from one of them! 

But in singling each of them out, it isn’t to overlook every other employee that greeted us a with a smile and a willingness to go out of their way in helping us. We know this always starts at the top - so huge credit to you. You should be VERY proud of your entire team. Clearly you have a extraordinary hiring and training program. However you do it - it is amazing and made us very happy and loyal customers of your hotel.

Many thanks - we do truly appreciate it. We will be back soon!",5,2019,12,24
41,Amazing stay!,"I stayed at the Edition Barcelona in September and had a fantastic experience.  I arrived early and the front office team was able to not only have a room ready for me by 8am while I had breakfast but also provide and upgrade.  The hotel is beautiful, everything seems fresh and new and the cleanliness both in the guest room and throughout the hotel is immaculate.  

I work in the industry and the sales team (Georgina and Alfredo) made me feel extra special by proving amenities and arranging for a nice experience at the rooftop. 

The location is perfect and Concierges Rodrigo and Girgio were both so helpful in creating the best itinerary for me to see as much as I could in the short 3 days I was there.  They also had great recommendations for local restaurants and bars and made reservations for me everywhere.

Everyone throughout my stay was genuinely friendly and it really made for the best experience...Gresa, Diana and Marina at the front desk, the housekeeper at turndown service and all of the bellman are great.

Charly and Carolina and the bartender team in the Punchroom are outstanding! They serve amazingly tasty punches and other drinks and their lively personalities will make the evening a ton of fun!

The room was spacious, comfortable, clean and well adorned and the bathroom had an amazing shower. Checkin was made exceptional by the sweet, smiley Katia. She was incredibly attentive and always asked about our day and if there was anything she could do to make our stay better. The breakfast buffet with hot options are exceptional. Had the eggs Benedict very day except our last when my hubby and I splurged on sweets. Addetta provided exceptional service every morning. Kudos to Rodrigo, the concierge for great recommendations.

41,Chaos at reception/noise all day,"They try very hard to sell upgrades. Banging all night and day from above rooms. waiting area near reception is nice. Location on La Ramba is excellent. A lot of restaurants nearby. I don't understand why the review has to be 2000 characters, but here they are.",2,2019,12,09
41,SUCH A PLEASURE,"Fantastic location near The Barcelona Cathedral,  AMAZING staff!  Small boutique hotel where everyone truly cares about their guests!
 Excellent personalized concierge service from Giorgio and Sebastian . 
Very comfortable rooms with a large bathroom( great shower!)
Had drinks at the bar - again, great staff!! Great speciality drinks.",5,2019,12,02
41,Excellent Hotel and Service,"This is one of my favorite hotels I’ve ever stayed at! The staff was amazing from the minute we walked through the door as well as throughout the entire stay. The bedroom was great, bed was super comfy and pillows were perfect. The bathroom was excellent as well! Overall I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona, we will be back!!",5,2019,11,30
41,Fabulous stay,"We had an excellent experience at The Edition. Nicely appointed rooms with simple, elegant decor. Bathroom is very big with a enormous shower. We had included breakfast which I recommend. Small cold buffet is out, but you can order off the menu. The shakshuka is amazing. The rooftop bar is an added bonus for spectacular views of the city, day or night.  We had the best cocktails here. They have lovely double sun beds to lounge in and heat lamps for chilly nights. The staff is very friendly and helpful and Georgio the concierge was incredible knowledgeable  and assisted us with reservations. The location is perfect and walkable to most attractions.  There’s a beautiful food market next door to grab a quick bite. The Edition has it all. ",5,2019,11,26
41,Average hotel,"We thought that is boutique hotel was very charming...before getting there.
The room is nice, especially the bathroom. But lobby is very average and service is fine but quite far from the Mandarin Oriental, which also has a bigger reputation, better location for a very similar price.
Quite disappointing for this price. At least they have good marketing, because we got lured. However we will not come back because of 2 main flaws:
-service: average, waited until 3PM to get our room ready. The room was supposed to have a view of the market (hence a higher price), however the view is just so average. 
-value for money: for this price, you can go to Mandarin Oriental and have better service, location. The room might not be as charming as Edition Hotel.",3,2019,11,24
41,Highly recommend!! ,"I cannot rave about the Edition enough.  Location was great. Close enough to Las Ramblas and the main tourist sights to walk to but not super touristy.  Modern European style hotel. Yes rooms are small but very modern, clean and sophisticatedly designed.  As beautiful the space, the staff truly made our stay. I wish I could remember everyone’s name but everyone was super nice and helpful. The lady at the front desk was wonderful - so welcoming and friendly.  Sebastian the concierge was fabulous - got us coveted reservations to 2 restaurants we wanted to go but couldn’t get in on our own. Lara at the lobby bar and the main bartender on the roof make amazing drinks and are so friendly.  We had breakfast every morning at the hotel - delicious and the servers were all so pleasant.  Great start to the day! All of the staff made our trip to this beautiful city even more memorable.   I highly recommend this hotel. We travel a lot and are Bonvoy members.  This hotel is legit.  ",5,2019,11,21
41,"Staff 5,  Systems 3","The original title of this review was ""First Edition, Final Edition"" but that would have been unfair to the wonderful people who make the hotel function as well as it does.  We have now stayed in 17 of the 24 Marriott Bonvoy brands.  The virtue of so many brands is that there's probably something for everyone's taste.  For us, the answer is not Edition.  There's too much noise from the outside, there's way too much aromatherapy in the public spaces and guest rooms, there are way too many pampered people who are happy to elbow you out of the way.  Not to say that some people would love it.

The efforts of the people who work at the Edition made our stay work out.  Special thanks to Anna, Katye, Reluca and Martin who helped us with room ""issues.""  (Apologies to any of them whose name I might misspelled.)  Warm appreciation to the breakfast team in Bar Veraz who helped us get every day off to a good start.  Great people, great smiles!",4,2019,11,11
41,One of the Best Boutique Hotels,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights. The staff was genuinely friendly and helpful.  They went our of there way to have a converstation with you asking ""how was your day"" and ""what were you going to do today.""  The hotel is a little hard to find and only has a small plaque with its name.  I would you suggest that you look at the picture to recognize the hotel.  There is no driveway so you get out on the street and cross a plazza to get to the front door.  We are Marriott platinum members so our breakfast was included.  The breakfast includes cold selections and a warm entre all of which were very good.  The rooftop bar has a great view and is good for lite bites with drinks.  If you don't like cigarette smoke, the roof top bar might not be the place for you in the evenings.  Before the late crowd gets to the rooftop bar, the cigarette smoke is very minimal.  The hotel is a great place to stay and is convient to great shopping and the must do's in Barcelona.",5,2019,11,09
41,"Great hotel, great location!!!","I really like this hotel. The decor, the location is just great. The amenities are spot on! The only flaw is that the rooms are small and the restaurant is a tad on the lacking side. There are many other restaurant near-by. I wish we had stayed in a larger room. The staff could not be any nicer.",4,2019,11,01
41,True luxury,"Thank you for an amazing stay 1-2 of May. After an overbooking at another hotel we ended up at Barcelona Edition and stayed with you high up in the building as we had wished for. We were so impressed of all the beautiful furniture and of course, the view – amazing. Later that night we ended up at the punch room after a late birthday dinner and had some drinks along with punch and a game off pool. When we came back to our room, we found a surprise. You had noted that it was my girlfriend’s birthday and therefore you had left a delicious chocolate cake for us to enjoy before bedtime, it’s really the little things. 

The next morning, we enjoyed breakfast at the restaurant at the hotel and both of us assured that this must have been one of the best breakfasts we have ever had. 

Thank you for this experience. We will be back in Barcelona this autumn and are ready to see you then!",5,2019,11,01
41,Not a good place for Bonvoy Elites. ,"Currently staying here at the edition. The initial contact from the hotel to the check in process was a huge disappointment and has left me wanting to check out early to move to another hotel. 

From Initial contact where they flatly stated their upgrade policy for lifetime titanium elites which is in direct conflict with Marriott Rewards terms and conditions, to the check in and room assignment process it was a shameful and disappointing experience. 

This hotel is supposed to be one of luxury and upmost service where a guest can relax and enjoy a special experience. It is the type of hotel where a bonvoy elite member should want to come and stay, but they have shown they do not want business from elite members, and will not honor marriott rewards terms and conditions unless you shame yourself to beg them for an upgrade. Something you should never have to do at a hotel of this calibre. 

Today I arrived at 2:30 PM. I enquired about an upgrade and was told they upgraded me according to the email that was sent. When I inquired for an upgrade that matched the marriott rewards T&Cs the front desk called central reservations and they agreed if I would wait they would upgrade me to a better room. I was promised a call to let me know when the room we had discussed was available. 

After 3 hours I returned to the front desk to check on my room as I had not heard back as promised. I received a run around about the room and what was available from another desk agent and requested that the first agent who helped me contact me when she came back. 1 hour later (now 4 hours waiting in total and 6:30PM) they finally came to the bar to speak to me about my room. They said here is your room which was not the upgrade we had discussed.  I asked why and they said reservations says it's not available now (4 hours after I checked in and sure enough the room now showed unavailable. I asked why it changed when it was available the whole time including when I checked in and we spoke about the reservation and was told someone else booked it ( very coincidental timing)). I said how come you haven't booked me into a nicer room than what I was originally booked into and I was told none were available.  I showed the agent the Marriott website showing availability again and she said, oh ok I can get you booked into that upgraded room. 

As a lifetime platinum elite it took 4 hours for access to a room at 6:30 PM. Access that I essentially had to beg for in front of other guests because ""central reservations says no rooms are available"" when that is a flat out lie and the fact they simply did not want to upgrade an elite guest beyond their own internal policy which does not follow the marriott T&Cs. 

This hotel is beautiful,  the bars and restaurants stunning and 5 star.  The treatment of their guests, and especially their elite status guest is a shameful 1 star experience. 

",1,2019,10,31
41,Excellent hotel and location,"Location is absolutely perfect and very central to El Born and Gothic Quarter. Staff very attentive and helpful with questions and booking day trips. Breakfast buffet (included in our price) was excellent and you could order off the menu as well. Rooftop bar is awesome. Great views. Have  a cabaret on Thursday nights....dinner, then DJ on 2nd floor, and then live music downstairs 12-2. Nice little surprise we stumbled on during our stay.  Also, live music for Sunday brunch (12-4) was great and enjoyed by all. I would recommend this hotel for a perfect stay in Barcelona. ",5,2019,10,30
41,Great service and location ,"As a Platinum Bonvoy member I had high expectations and the Barcelona Edition did not disappoint. Spacious, modern room with a beautiful rooftop bar. Great location with fantastic service. Every staff member we met made us feel special.",5,2019,10,29
41,Worst hotel ever!!,"Small expensive rooms, bad food,dirty,WiFi when it works is slow, my door would not lock and after hours of dealing with the horrible staff and spoke to the incompetent arrogant unprofessional GM. Guy has no idea what business he is in? Poorly managed property in every way. Save your vacation and pick another hotel.",1,2019,10,28
41,Mostly good with some issues,"This is a nice, new, modern hotel in a great central location in Barcelona.  There are several restaurant options including a rooftop bar.  We had a few issues at the hotel - our room wasn't ready at check-in and while we waited on the roof, we were told a few times it was 'almost ready' and someone would be up with our keys.  We waited for a long time and finally I had to go down to get things moving after the official check-in time.  As an ambassador elite member travelling with an infant, this was a bit frustrating.  The service at the rooftop bar was pretty awful as well with long waits.  And the ""pool"" is a tiny little thing with no seating area.  However, the Punch Room was the opposite - great vibe, amazing service, and really good food.  The breakfast was also very nice, the staff was so sweet to my baby (they always remembered his name) and the benedicts were excellent.  The rooms were pretty nice with large bathrooms and they gave us a nice kit for our baby.  However, beware that the cribs are teeny, tiny - smaller than a mini crib.  My 8 month old barely fit.",4,2019,10,27
41,"Simple, Trendy, Great Staff and Location","This hotel was everything we needed for our 3 day stay in Barcelona.. the staff was always available and ready to assist with a smile.  Georgio and James gave excellent recommendations for dining, transportation, directions, etc.  It is in the perfect location for shopping, dining, exploring... walk just about everywhere.
We had an early morning check out (4:00 am) and James met us with fresh hot coffee as we walked out the door. 
We had a lovely dinner in their dining room and listened to a live Latin Trio.  Truly a wonderful experience and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!",5,2019,10,20
41,Great Choice,"I truly had a great experience at this hotel which is located on the edge of El Born District and off from the main tourist area but close enough. My biggest compliment about this hotel is the staff. The doorman, front desk receptionists, concierge, waitress staff and housekeeping were as nice and friendly as can be. The concierge was a gem helping me to find out of the way local restaurants to eat at and his choices were spot on. Besides that, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel has an adequate gym to get you by while staying there. The rooftop bar / restaurant has a nice selection of food and drinks and you can also just chill out on the lounge beds of take a dip in the plunge pool. All in all, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2019,10,14
41,Great location,"This is the best hotel in terms of being situated near the Rambla and thus having tons of options for attractions and restaurants. The interior of the room was very nice, loved their soft robe. Service was great by every individual that we encountered.",5,2019,10,10
41,Praise where praise is due,"We love Edition hotel Barcelona. This is not hyperbole.  We love everything about it, from the roof to the cellar Cabaret. But the most stupendous thing about this particular hotel is its staff.  
What a team.  You can see that they work together seamlessly.  They are attentive to our needs and give us the most welcoming hugs when we come.  I schedule events for a group in Barcelona and every chance I get I book something in the Edition.  Brunch with live music or a grown folks evening listening to music and having the best meal ever in the Cabaret.  Here in the Cabaret is truly grown folks business.  I want to dress up in a bygone era clothing and dance the jitterbug or do the two-step in someone's arms.  Last night was no exception. The new chef is on par with the one that left.  So our meal met our expectations and delivered over the top goodness.  We love the music that we hear piped into the different rooms as we sip a cocktail in the punch room. By the way the punch room has the most amazing staff,  Patient and professional and very friendly indeed. Or meander up to the rooftop the music is great to listen to and belongs in a class by itself.  There is no praise high enough for this establishment,  The Edition could give lessons in how to treat guests to all of the rest of the hotels in Barcelona.  There is a genuineness and openness that is shared by the staff from the time they open the door to the time they say to us goodnight that keeps us coming back for more.  
They deserve the rating 4 stars.  I give Edition Barcelona four and a half stars.  

It's a little pricey but that is what you would expect from this kind of establishment but on Wednesday nights they have a menu that is reasonable and not expensive. If  you are older than 21 you will enjoy this place that is geared toward grown folks at least on Wednesday nights",5,2019,10,10
41,Nice view,"We went there for a couple of drinks, place is very cool and view is nice. Also staff is professional and friendly. Everyone speak english what is very good for tourists. We had very nice experience :)",5,2019,10,08
41,Where You Want To Be,"Excellent hotel is part of the new Marriott collection of properties.  It is located a few minutes walk from the historic areas of the City and not far from the seaport.  Nice sized rooms for a European-style property with a very helpful staff.  Multiple bar locations and limited dining area.  Plunge pool and gym area is limited, so it might be somewhat limited for family use.  Great for couples who want to be in the heart of all the action.",5,2019,10,05
41,Deserves Highest Rating,"I hardy ever give 5 circles but this property deserves it and more. From the moment I walked in to the moment I left, everything was excellent. Rather than detail everything this hotel did right, I can summarize by simply saying they do everything outstandingly. The rooms are spacious and modern. Fitness center is excellent. Staff go beyond expectations [Diana at front desk was especially helpful]. The bars and restaurants are terrific including a stylish roof top bar. Finally, the location is perfect for visiting the city with proximity to two metro lines and easy walking distance to many sites.",5,2019,10,05
41,Excellent Barcelona hotel ,We enjoyed our stay at The Barcelona Edition. The staff were friendly and attentive.  The rooms were modern and high tech.  We loved the contemporary vibe and The Edition fragrance that you could smell throughout the hotel.  The rooftop views were nice.  ,5,2019,10,05
41,Great location.  Great service,"Very pleasant 5 day stay at the Barcelona Edition.    The best part of the experience was the very attentive and hardworking staff at the hotel.  The concierge service was above and beyond with information and helpfulness.  Location was perfect to walk to many popular sights of the city.  Cab service was an unexpectedly difficult issue only during rush hour in the mornings ...and that was something we wish we would have been told since it was a recurring issue.  The hotel roof top bar was a nice retreat with great views of the city.  Although the hotel was full during our stay, the service remained consistent and the nights were always very very quiet and restful. Breakfast was a full breakfast in the lobby area and was never crowded or noisy.",5,2019,10,04
41,"Attentive staff, great location","I LOVED this hotel.  It's beautiful and in a great location.  The staff is so attentive, and they made me feel like a special guest everytime i passed through the lobby.  One of the women at the front desk was especially fantastic and so sweet--Katia (I'm sure I'm not spelling her name right) but she gave me great recommendations, inquired about my experiences at those recommendations, and this demeanor was common throughout the staff.  The housekeeping staff kept the room spectacularly clean and replenished as needed.  I didn't get to try the buffet breakfast as they were just starting it up when I left, but I had breakfast there one morning which was excellent. The drinks on the roof and the Punch room were great, and while I didn't get to check out the dinner show, I'll have to go next time.  Also, the gym in the hotel is well equipped!",5,2019,10,03
41,Hip boutique hotel,"This is a very good hotel, centrally located, with excellent customer service.  It is located next to the Santa Caterina Market and within several blocks of the Barcelona Cathedral.  The location is perfect for visiting the major Barcelona sites and is within walking distance to many outstanding restaurants.  The location offers excellent transportation options including walking, metro, taxi, and the Barcelona City Tour hop-on/hop-off bus.

We enjoyed and recommend two of the hotel restaurants including Bar Veraz on the first floor for lunch and the rooftop lounge for late afternoon drinks.

The hotel Frontdesk and Concierge Service were very helpful in obtaining restaurant reservations, advance tickets to the major sites, directions, and taxies.",4,2019,10,03
41,Upscale elegance meets family style hospitality,"After having stayed at a number of Edition properties the Barcelona Edition is as good as they come. The design, ambiance, and scent that permeates throughout the hotel is nothing short of amazing. The staff is extremely friendly and make you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. If you are looking for a comfortable and classy place to stay there is no hotel in Barcelona that can compare. Surprisingly the hotel was a little quiet when we stayed on a Thursday night especially the Punch Room which means the word is not out yet. Regardless Punch Room manager Carlos took really good care of us and made our stay that much better. We'll certainly be back anytime we visit Barcelona!",5,2019,09,30
41,100% Recommend - EXCELLENT Customer Service,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend. We had high expectations for the property given it's an Edition and brand new and I'm pleased to say it exceeded our expectations. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by very friendly staff at the front desk and checked in immediately (along with a room upgrade). The hotel is situated in a perfect location, the food was spectacular and the rooms were perfect - spacious, clean and comfortable. The customer service is where we were blown away - everyone went out of there way to ensure we were well taken care from start to finish. We felt like we were receiving the royal treatment the entire time. I would stay here again in a heartbeat if I'm ever back in Barcelona!",5,2019,09,30
41,Fantastic stay!,"Stayed on points recently and it was worth every bit of it. The location is perfect. Right between El born neighborhood with narrow ancient streets and a little more of a local feel and the Gothic Quarter. We walked almost everywhere but taxis were easy to get our front. The hotel is simple but trendy and they do it right. Don’t expect huge benefits for Bonvoy Titanium members, we did however get upgraded to a great studio with views. Bed and shower was amazing. If you’re looking for a Marriott with PERFECT location and want some extras like a fantastic rooftop bar and a super-swanky PunchRoom Bar(check it out for a nightcap), look no further!  Concierge had amazing recommendations for dinners and tapas as well - every one was outstanding!",5,2019,09,28
41,Perfect location!,"We selected the Edition because we could use our Marriott points.  It was in a great location near the Gothic district, the Born district and in walking distance to many attractions. The staff were all smiling, delightful, and helpful in every situation. This is a boutique hotel, but had a lovely lobby and bar, and a nice rooftop bar as well.  The pool is VERY small, so don't plan to swim laps, but the views of Barcelona are well worth sitting around it!  The beds were very comfortable with crisp white sheets and comforter.  Pillows are down.  The shower was large and had rain shower head.  Hair dryer was high end.  USB ports are provided next to the bed to charge your phone/watch, etc., so no converter is necessary.  Overall, a perfect little hotel for travelers who plan to spend their time in the city.",4,2019,09,25
41,Exceptional Service,"Every. Single. Person. From the concierge, to bellman, the restaurant staff to the maintenance crew. Every bartender, operator and receptionist has treated me like family. Not the type of family one says hi to and makes small talk just to be chatty, the type where you feel that they have your best interest at heart, and would move mountains, sacrificing themselves to ensure that you had one beautiful, easy day, not seeking recognition or even letting you know how hard they have worked so you may have a single moment of relaxation. 

There hasn't been one time a door wasn't opened or a passing in the hallway without being met with a salutation and a smile. These are the moments I have always remembered, the ones that make the difference in a stay.",5,2019,09,25
41,"Wonderful staff, good location","I was staying three nights from September 18. The hotel has some style and location is so good - only a few distance to the sea, Gothic area, Palau de la Musica, Rambla, etc...But most of all, I would like to bring my big thank you to the staff. All are so kind. When checking in, Roberto(I am not sure this is correct) made my late check-in smooth offering water, as I arrived after 11pm due to 3 hour delayed flight and very tired. Especially, Giorgio (concierge) helped me for my lots of questions and bookings for tour. As I didn't have much time to prepare this trip, his professional information and suggesting solutions helped me a lot. Also, I THANK to Martin, who helped my luggage when checking out. As I left Barcelona during La Marce, when the street was blocked, so I had to bring my heavy luggage to the unblocked road where I could take taxi. Martin gave me his hand and walked almost 20~30 min. I believe the hotel who has staff like those I mentioned above seems to have more important assets than the style. Thank you again for making my trip like home!!!",5,2019,09,24
41,DO. NOT. STAY. HERE.,"I stayed at the Edition for 4 days in September 2019 and it was without exaggeration the worst experience I’ve ever had with staying at a hotel (... and I travel a lot for both business and pleasure). 

We booked a “loft room” for our stay... and spent a LOT of money to do so as we wanted a nicer room for our stay in Barcelona. Upon checking in, we were shown to a room that was an absolute joke— smaller than any luxury European hotel and had nothing about it that could be described as a loft. There were no separate floors and the ceilings were lower than any normal room would be. The tables were dirty and sticky and the entire property smelled like vinegar being covered up with massive about bad perfume. 

I went down to the front desk to let them know that I think I was given the wrong room. They told me that I was indeed in a loft room and that it was one of the nicest rooms they had. I sled what made it a loft room and was told “that’s just what it’s called”. So basically, false advertising. The gentleman at the front desk was also quite rude when I asked if I could cancel this reservation and find elsewhere to stay. His exact quote was “There’s no way that will happen”... and judged on his tone, this response was not due to just a language barrier.

I went back to my room and called Bonvoy and asked them if I could cancel my reservation so that I could find another, nicer hotel in the area. I spoke to a very nice representative who said that if I wasn’t happy with the hotel they could certainly do that... but first asked if they could connect me with the hotel manager so she could help remedy situation. I told the Bonvoy rep that I didn’t think there was anything they could do to help unless they could expedite getting a refund. I spoke with the manager, Stephanie, anyone, who was kind enough to offer taking one night of the stay off of our bill and moving us to a “nicer room” as it would be “very difficult to process a full refund”. At this point, I was exhausted, so I agreed. 

They moved us to a room on a lower floor... the only difference was that the window seat was a foot longer, there was a small table near the bed, and there was a bigger tub. In no way was this a room that comparable to a “loft room” and was still quite small. 

Come the end of our stay, I asked the front desk if they could confirm that we would be credited 1 nights stay and the front desk rep had no idea what I was talking about but they would “email me a confirmation of the refund”. 

I’m then sent an email after leaving the hotel that they would not be refunding me anything as I had purchased a “special non-refundable rate” (?!?!?!?!). I emailed them back immediately to explain that was NOT what the manager, Stephanie, had promised me... otherwise we would have demanded a full refund, left the hotel, and stayed elsewhere. 

Stephanie just emailed me saying that she can unfortunately not refund the 1 nights charge like she said she would. I am pretty stunned that this was her response since she was the one that proposed this in order to get us to stay at the property. I immediately asked for her boss’ contact info and the Bonvoy Manager’s info to report the situation. 

I don’t understand how any hotel can do business like this. Needless to say, this place is a joke and not worth anyone’s business (by the way, for a real laugh, check out their rooftop “pool” and common areas... because they are nothing like what the picture show).",1,2019,09,18
41,Incredible Experience,"As a hardcore Bonvoy member, I stay almost exclusively at Marriott properties. Having visited Barcelona many times, my stats have been spread over The W Barcelona, The Arts Hotel and the Central Grand. This was my first stay at the Edition, and wow...what a class act. It’s been years since I have seen such incredible pride shown by STAFF for the hotel they work at. Helpful to the n’th degree; willing to do anything and everything to make a guest feel valued. Elegant and modern ambience, beautiful rooms and classy service. Would return in a minute!!! Kudos to what is clearly an amazing management team. THANK YOU!!!",5,2019,09,13
41,Really neat upscale hotel!,"Hotel is in a great location and right next door to the Mercado Santa Caterina. Easy access to taxis and metro. Right near the Barcelona Cathedral. Front desk, concierge, bellmen service was stellar, absolutely perfect really! Really like the interior decor! Rooms are very current with lots of technology. However, room is small including the bath. Rooftop bar is awesome but struggled to get seating and service was super slow. Great spot though and would definitely stay again. 4.5 stars if I could, would be 5 if the rooms were a bit bigger. No benefit to being a Marriott Bonvoy member with Titanium status.",4,2019,09,11
41,✨,"Celebrated my Bday over there, had a super fun time. Food, music and atmosphere was perfect! Will always come back!
Go there if you want to have a good time with ur friends.. Or family. 
You will enjoy!",5,2019,09,06
41,The nicest terrace in all Barcelona,"The rooftop ofThe Barcelona Edition. This is one of my favorite places in all the city. The best place you can find in all the center to have a good drink and enjoy the sunset with a wonderfully view. More than recommended. Nice music, cool ambient, good service and very charming hosts! U shouldn’t loos it ✨",5,2019,09,04
41,Upscale and good,"At premium 5 star hotel I would expect: 1) check-in should be fast, friendly and with glass of cava. They have room to improve here. 2) Nice ambience and impressive design. Yes, yes, yes! 3) Carefully designed room with the attention to small details. Yes, absolutely the case. Bath amenities from Labo is something special. 4) Good restaurant and bar. They have probably the best bar in Barcelona I've ever been. 5) Finally, excellent minibar with coffee machine available. Yes, indeed.",5,2019,09,01
41,Fantastic Hotel,"Arrived midday when check in wasn’t till 3pm. 

Requested if there is an opportunity for a room upgrade as was for the trip for my girlfriend for her birthday and they offered us the 1 bed suite was was spectacular! Comes with separate bath and huge walk in shower. 

The staff are so nice and attentive. We sadly misplaced a bag in a taxi and they were on to the taxi company to trace it down.

Rooftop bar is brilliant for pre-drinks prior to going out and also the roof top pool is great for relaxing in.

We had room 706 which is on 7th floor and you get amazing views over the market and the sea. 

I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Barcelona. It’s so close to all the main sights and 30min walk to the beach.

41,The Barcelona Edition rooftop bar,"It was my second time in Barcelona and decided to visit the newly opened Edition. I had previously visited the ones in London and Miami, I was already a big fan of the brand. I visited the rooftop and had an amazing experience; besides the elegant design and the stunning views everyone was welcoming, they made me feel at home. The server who attended me, Radyana, was very nice, knowledgeable and attentive and gave me great food and drinks recommendations (you need to try the tuna taco!). Thanks to the manager Cat as well who made sure everything ran smoothly. I came back a few days later and I was recognised from the staff! Service was as great as the first time. Once they closed the rooftop bar, they invited me to try the Punch bar, a true hidden gem! I had the best time thanks to Ivan, terrific bartender with a quirky sense of humor. Will definitely come back!",5,2019,08,26

Pro’s: Really amazing view + bigger space than Skybar.

Con’s: I would suggest (humble opinion) to add more options to the bar bites even though the food was delicious.",4,2019,08,23
41,Do it - you know you want to!,"Overall this experience was fantastic, we went to their Cabaret supper club and it is a place that excels expectations. The club/space is beautiful, relaxed and at the same time the staff is attentive and knowledge. 

The food was fun & thoughtful, and exceptionally well thought through dishes & wine pairings with enough novelty to keep you smiling. The service was beyond fault & the setting just beautiful. 

I loved everything about this caberet, the live performance was spectacular too! A must for everyone in the area at least once.",5,2019,08,22
41,Another amazing experience at The Barcelona Edition,"This was actually our second time staying at this hotel. The first time was during the pre-opening time and that first experience what actually made us came back again this year. It was such a nice and memorable stay!

I mean, what else you could've asked for? This hotel is centrally located in the city of Barcelona, you could even walk to the train station nearby and option of metro stops. 

The service was started from the moment we came in - guest's recognition at the check-in desk (i mean, wow!!). Very professional, welcoming and accommodating. Thanks to some of the front office associates; Munir, Katia, Martin for their genuine assistance and made our stay effortless. Well done guys!!

Room experience, we were very happy with our room. The bed? By far the best bed we have ever slept in. I love their signature hotel amenities and the scents from LeLabo fragrances - very much in-line with the hotel ambiance and vibes.

The Roof bar & lounge on the top floor; best place to spend an early evening with some of their best snacks and cocktails before stepping out for dinner and experience Barcelona's nightlife. I have to mention this again though, guest's recognition from The Roof's staff; Thanks for your genuine service Lena & Uri.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel for your upcoming stay in Barcelona. We sure will come back again. #Love",5,2019,08,22
41,Perfect Hotel ,"Recently on a trip to Spain we stayed at the Edition. I was a bit skeptical when we arrived but I was proven wrong. It was a well designed hotel with great service. 

If I could make a complaint it would be the room is a touch small. One other issue would be the “pool” on the roof.  I would use the term pool very lightly. It was more of a large bathtub at best. Since I was not really in Barcelona to swim it was ok. The roof had a great bar and lounge area fun place to end the day. I am not sure I would stay there more than the 3 nights we did just because of the room size and closet space. 
They had a great breakfast on the ground floor. Staff was pleasant and helpful. 

Location was perfect for getting around and cabs were easy to get as there was a cab stand on the corner. 

Really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for anyone passing through the area. ",5,2019,08,18
41,Ecstatic about service,We could not of been happier with so many aspects of this Hotel. It is perfectly located in the central part of the city theare newly  appointed and most important of all the service was impeccable. The staff from top to bottom could not of been nicer and they elevated our whole stay. All four of us traveling together agreed we would go back to the Edition in a heartbeat. ,5,2019,08,14
41,We were ecstatic,"We could not have been happier with so many aspects of this hotel. It was perfectly located for central part of the city, the rooms were newly appointed and most important of all, the service was impeccable. The staff from top to bottom could not have been nicer and they elevated our whole stay. If I was nitpicking, I would say the rooms were a little tight and did not have enough outlets for this day and age. We were traveling with my cousin and his wife and we all agreed we would come back to the Edition in a heartbeat.",5,2019,08,14
41,Superior Hotel centrally located in town,This has to be one of the nicest hotels in Europe. It is centrally located and is very beautiful inside with walnut wood paneling and gorgeous scent throughout the lobby. The hotel staff are truly amazing and helpful. Charlotte checked us in and could not have been more friendly. The General Manager is always around and checking with the guests to make sure all is perfect. The room was updated with comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom with large walk-in shower. There is a roof top bar with excellent views and amenities. Highly recommended!,5,2019,08,12
41,"My Glasses Got Swiped. Staff response? ""Meh""","We had a very different experience to other reviews I read here. While the location is excellent for walking in the Gothic Quarter, the service was well below 5-star expectations and our room that was upgraded to the ""best available"" was ity-bity. The biggest issue was when my beautiful and brand-new prescription sunglasses were stolen whilst sitting at their rooftop bar and my efforts to retrieve them met with indifference. That said, I agree with others that the hotel is clean and nice. And when it came to finding a quick replacement for my glasses before our ship sailed, I found one man at the front desk who went above and beyond to help me. 

The Front Desk: 
At any hotel your first impression is how they treat you at the front desk. At the Barcelona Edition I could easy wait for 20 minutes at the front desk being ignored until my husband showed up, at which point the staff were instantly attentive. This happened repeatedly and by both male and female employees. Another example of our front desk experience was at check-in where we were eligible for a ""best available"" upgrade. However, our upgraded room was tiny! Given that this was a 5 star hotel, there were six additional room categories above the one we were in, (based off pictures on the web site), and it being a mid-week visit, we had a hard time believing that NONE of the rooms with views, balconies, seating areas or picture windows were available. At the time we chalked it up to being old Europe and the room was modern and clean and nice enough. Still, for a brand new 5 star hotel it had the tiniest rooms we’d ever seen and couldn’t imagine the size of a basic room! Once we returned home and looked up the various rooms again of course it’s obvious that likely there were many nicer rooms which they likely didn’t feel like “giving away” or, being gracious, perhaps they had a huge event (with invisible guests?) and were otherwise sold out of suites. For what it’s worth, if you have status in that hotel group and are hoping to be upgraded, be prepared to do some legwork in advance and spend more of your precious vacation time working for it if it’s that important to you. We decided to let it go but wanted to share it here for others to note. 

The Rooftop Bar Mis-Adventure:
The rooftop is very popular with locals and guests alike. The view is stunning and the lounge beds are a picturesque way to take in the Barcelona skyline. However, some of the specialty spirits we ordered from the menu were unavailable. Service was very mixed. Food was decently interesting. But the view!!  Beware:  My BRAND NEW prescription sunglasses were STOLEN whilst dining on the rooftop. I was very careful with my bag, especially given that Barcelona is well known for petty theft. However when the sun went down I set my glasses beside me on the cushion. In a flash they were gone. In my jet-lag haze I assumed I'd left them in the room but by morning remembered exactly what had happened. We went back up first thing in the morning and the waitress could not care less. She pretended to dial housekeeping and then ignored us. We searched for ourselves, drank a coffee, and waited an hour for her to get back to us, thus waisting an entire morning of our one full day in Barcelona. Finally we went to the front desk.  While they too were nonplussed at my loss, (they reached housekeeping instantly but to no avail), they did offer to help me find a place to replace my prescription (Cottete) before our ship sailed in 48 hrs. which was amazing and much appreciated! 

Getting back to upstairs bar/restaurant, There are 2 sides to the viewing platform. One has Bali-style beds and supposedly faces the water however I had no idea there was water out there anywhere or that the two sides were totally different until the next morning when the hunt for my glasses began. Check both sides before deciding on your experience.

Also, note that locals also come there to enjoy the view and, apparently, to steal sunglasses from unwitting and/or sleep-deprived tourists. (I only say that because the local lady sitting next to me was the most likely culprit as I realized I had set them on the bench between us before they vanished). I was told some tables are reserved for guests priority so don't forget to mention that you are guests if there is a wait. The tiny pool you see in the pictures is only for a quick dip, rather than a swim. While we were there it was mostly used for Instagram photo sessions for pouty girls in tiny dresses taking turns posing seductively on the steps.

The location is in a buzzy part of the city in the middle of the Gothic Quarter and right beside an ancient marketplace and walkable cafes and independently owned shops. We walked to the Picasso Museum, Sagrada Familia and everywhere else we wanted to go from our home-base at the hotel, which was our main reason for choosing it. However, note that there is no conspicuous signage which, while classy, also makes it not so easy to find. 

Overall, CardamomTuesday says:  If you really want to be in the center of the Gothic Quarter like we did and plan to walk everywhere you go, Barcelona Edition is modern, tasteful and just fine. If you want a truly 5 star experience, look elsewhere.",3,2019,08,09
41,Above all expectations,"Last weekend we enjoyed some cups of cava on the amazing rooftop, with a view over Barcelona. After the drinks we went downstairs for the Cabaret show and a lovely dinner. The dinner and show was absolutely above all my expectation of flavours and delicious food. During the dinner, there are small episodes of sing and dance which give you an evening full of joy and entertaining while eating your dinner.",5,2019,08,09
41,Small boutique hotel great location,Excellent location for touring the city. Rooms are small but well appointed. Only double beds available and suitable for adults rather than young families. This was a pre cruise stay within the Marriott chain. Extremely friendly and capable staff of well trained young people. Good dining facility in house and next door to an excellent restaurant as well. Not a resort style hotel but a pleasant stay for our adult multi generation family.i would stay here again.,4,2019,08,08
41,Wonderful stay!,"If you are visiting Barcelona then only look at the Edition hotel.  This hotel is in the middle of the city with accessibility to all areas.  When my wife and I arrived we were greeted by Ricardo who was amazing speaking English and slow Spanish as my wife and I were trying to communicate in our Spanglish. He was so welcoming and asking about our travels. He passed us along to Ana who checked us in. She was very hospitable and took us through what amenities the hotel has to offer. She took her time going through the map of the area and pointing out where we should venture out to see. It was one of the most pleasant check in experiences.  As we entered the room it was spacious and we had a really nice view of the city. The hotel is equipped with intuitive lighting, large tub and large rain shower. Complimentary water and Nespresso was a nice touch as well. My wife and I wanted to venture outside the city to the monastery and winery. We went to the concierge Sebastian and he guided us through what would be our best options for the day. He took his time (my wife asks a lot of random questions) and was just amazing to deal with.  And thank you to the rest of the team from housekeeping to the rooftop everyone was super nice and accommodating.

I had the opportunity to meet Edwin the GM. He is a special kind of General Manager.  The way he interacts with the guests and his team, you can understand why this hotel is tops in the city.

Thank you Edition team for making our visit to Barcelona special.",5,2019,08,05
41,Wonderful Chic Hotel Inn Downtown Barcelona,The Edition is new and lovely. Details are modern and elegant. Service is Four Seasons quality. The rooftop bar and restaurant (and pool) is where you’ll want to spend most of your waking hours when you are not touring the city. The edition also has three other dining venues that are very cool. Highly recommended!,5,2019,08,05
41,"New Hotel, New Venue","The Edition is a fairly new upmarket Hotel in the Center of Barcelona just off Via Laeitana. Walk into the lobby and you instantly feel that you have come up in the world. From the doorman to the decor speaks volumes of sophistication. Many know the view from the rooftop but this hotel has unexpected hidden gems. How about a quiet afterwork drink? No not in the lobby. In the well appointed Punch Room. This room harks back to the days of comfort and style as a given.  Cosy setting, plush chairs, conerrsation nooks to share with a few friends. Wink, wink, nod, nod there is a pool table so you can wile away an hour or two. Think of a gentlemen's club but ladies are invited. I absolutely love this place.  Some evenings they even have music in there for your quiet listen pleasure. This setting allows you to unwind without fear of bumping elbows with your grandchild. ",5,2019,07,25
41,"Incredible, perfect hotel","Spent 3 wonderful nights at this hotel on my honeymoon. We loved everything about this hotel. It is new and beautiful, and in an excellent location. The upgraded room we were given (as an Ambassador member -- top tier) was incredible; it was the kind room makes you daydream about living in it full-time (or at least returning ASAP)! The service was exceptional and they went out of their way to make sure that our honeymoon experience was special. We enjoyed the food and experience both at the bar downstairs and at the rooftop bar/plunge pool. After nearly a decade of staying at Marriott properties frequently enough to earn their top tier of status, I've stayed at hundreds of Marriott-affiliated properties, and I think the Barcelona Edition may be the best of the bunch!",5,2019,07,21
41,Fabulous location and you feel cooler for even staying there!,"I must pat myself on the back for booking this particular hotel. Perfect location between El Gothic and El Born neighborhoods. It made navigating the city easy. 

The hotel was modern, clean and just damn cool! There was a lobby bar, second floor late night bar, uber cool rooftop bar and the very secretive speakeasy bar with show in the very, very deep basement. The show was fascinating, you need to be very open minded to creative interpretations, we were and we loved it! 

I would highly recommend this hotel and we happily return!",5,2019,07,21
41,Great hotel! ,"Let’s just start with the fantastic service! From the minute you book, the concierge responds and suggest so many fun activities.. then when you arrive the front desk bends over backwards to make sure your stay is amazing. The rooftop bar is outstanding from the food, drinks but especially the service.  It is so clean and pretty. Thank you for being a great hotel. ",5,2019,07,21
41,Not good for families,"Nice hotel but absolutely not baby friendly and I would never stay here again based on my experience, especially with the front desk service (a few individuals in particular). Wait time at check in was terrible and not efficient (multiple people checking in one party and a manager that stood there doing nothing but told his team he was “to busy to check in guests”). 

But the reason I felt the need to write this review was that after carrying my 15 KG son up to the first floor (as there are no toilets on the ground floor) and discovering there was no where to change him, I had to change him on the floor in the hallway. After asking someone at the front desk if I just missed them, he was rude and just shook his head saying he didn’t think so. I then asked him to check and that I would wait in the restaurant right next to the check in desk and asked him to let me know. After 15 minutes of waiting, I paid my check and told the staff I would be leaving given my experience. Waitress was extremely apologetic and even walked me to the front desk to double check that there were no changing stations. Same guy again - wouldn’t even look at me or answer the question to me but told the waitress and she then apologized again. 

Just really can’t believe this type of service and the lack of proper baby facilities at such a nice hotel, and especially a Marriott brand. I had always thought of Marriott properties as extremely family friendly so this was a real disappointment for me. Hope to have a better experience at our next Marriott.",1,2019,07,20
41,"Great service, great location ","My wife and I stayed at The Barcelona Edition recently and were pleased in all respects.
Excellent location, staff were very helpful whenever we needed advise and to top it off the hotel has a great rooftop bar.
We recommend . 
",5,2019,07,18
41,Great stay,"We spent 3 nights here. Location is fantastic—close to lots of sections of the old city, with great museums and bars/restaurants. The food in the hotel restaurant is good and the room is comfortable and well designed. Great bed, nice bathroom, closet space, a loveseat, and a good sized desk. The rooftop bar offers a nice view over the city and was a pleasant place to sit during a rainstorm. It’s modern and clean and a haven after wandering the city. But what really makes this a hotel I’d come to? The staff. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the service and friendliness. The room is serviced twice a day (so great). Everyone was terrific but two went above and beyond. I had fallen and hurt my head and Martin, the bellman, brought me ice packs and took great care of me. Oriol, at the front desk, gave us great recommendations for things to do and was so helpful. To top it off, we returned from sightseeing on our last day to find wonderful gifts. After a conversation about how great the Picasso Museum was, Martin left me a sketch. And they’d arranged a wine tasting. The service here is exceptional. ",5,2019,07,15
41,"Contemporary, great hotel",Amazing staff and amazing rooms.  The property is gorgeous and everything was impeccable.  Our room was large with a nice bathroom that had a vanity situated in the middle of the bathroom with a toilet to one side and the shower on the opposite side.  The only funny issue is that my partner would accidentally run into the glass walls into the toilet area in the middle of the night.  We only had breakfast here but they did offer a nice meal.  The nice thing is this hotel is in the tourist area but more on the outskirts so it isn't in the thick of things.  Rooms are quiet and there is a nice rooftop bar.  If you go the opposite way of the tourist area you can explore the local neighborhood and find some amazing local restaurants in this area and some shops too.  Love this hotel and highly recommend it to anybody.  Also don't forget to check out the hidden bar.,5,2019,07,14
41,Weekend break in Barcelona ,"After trying the London Edition, we decided to try the Barcelona version and we were not disappointed. Great location, close to the port and right next to a bustling food market. 

Some taxis don’t know where it is yet, we did get dropped off a walk away initially but as soon as we arrived, we were welcomed with open arms and couldn’t do enough for us. They knew we were coming and had taken all our prior given information into account, knew that we had got recently married, found my Marriott account and to top off the early encounter, they upgraded our room and got us a free bottle of wine with our evening meal that night in Cabaret. 

The room was lovely, modern, comfortable, stylish and very quiet and relaxing. 

The bars and restaurants are top notch. We started in the rooftop bar which has a lovely pool, great staff and views. The Punch Room, was quiet, surprised not more people know about it, as it’s an amazing bar. Great (instagramable!) drinks and wonderful service who love to tell you the stories behind the punches they serve. 

The highlight though had to be the Cabaret, would thoroughly recommend this dining experience. Food and service was fantastic and the main event of the entertainment was varied, funny and enjoyable. They apparently change the act each night but would go back in a heartbeat. 

Room service, breakfasts and all other service throughout was great and we can’t wait to go back! ",5,2019,07,14
41,Excellent service and experience,"I've been at the Barcelona Edition several times now for dinner and drinks and I must sat that I'm always very pleased with both the service and the experience as a whole. We had dinner two times, once with the Cabaret show which is a remarkable experience both music wise and for the energetic vibes. The second time we went when a band was performing, cant remember the name of it but had the jazzy vibes and was a beautiful show. The food is very well curated, I can highly recommend the chickpea croquettes starters and Iberian ham, YUMMY! As main the chicken and the fish of the day, fresh food over all. Overall experience, loved it!",5,2019,07,12
41,Beautiful hotel and Great Staff!,"The hotel is a beautifully decorated new hotel. Its centrally located to many sites and great restaurants. The staff is incredible. We were treated like VIPs from all the staff. Oriol Camps at the front desk helped me book a wonderful show at a tablado nearby and recommended shops and restaurants nearby. Ricardo Vitale was also great in giving recommendations on tours and places to visit. They arranged taxi's to pick us up for several activities and made restaurant reservations for us too. The room was beautiful, clean and very spacious with a safe so we could keep our valuables in the hotel when we went out. The bathroom was very large with a shower and a tub, amazing toiletries and extremely comfortable beds and pillows made us go to sleep right away after a long day of shopping and tours. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby including a burger king. The rooftop provided a beautiful view of the city and the staff there were incredible. We went to eat at the Caberat Club in the hotel which aside from providing a great meal, provided an entertaining show. The bartender was excellent and made us some delicious drinks to try. Over all, I loved our stay at this wonderful hotel and we will definitely come back in the future. Great hotel, great staff and good food! Highly recommend!",5,2019,07,10
41,Amazing service and great location,"True to every Edition Hotel I've stayed at, this hotel was superb. From the concierge, to the mixologist at the bar, and the rest of the staff. Everyone was genuinely attentive and helpful. I was upgraded to a lovely suite upon my arrival, and even greeted with 4th of July cookies - which I thought was a very sweet gesture. The rooms are well appointed and there really is no better place to stay in Barcelona. The location is next door to St. Caterina market, and a short walk to the old town and the Gothic Quarter.",5,2019,07,07
41,Phenomenal Staff & Service,"We recently completed a stay at the Edition and we were completely taken away by the level of service.  We had an unfortunate medical emergency and the staff was beyond incredible in terms of helping us find medical care.  The hotel itself is beautiful and just like all the other hotels in the Edition Brand.  Having platinum status, they upgraded us to a room that faced El Borne street - would agree with other reviews that the rooms are small and our room was right off the elevator (like most of the Edition Hotels), but the layout is perfect and the finishing touches are beautiful (wish my bathroom at home looked like that!).  A huge shout out to the Managing Hostess at the Rooftop bar who went out of her way and even made my husband a special iced tea, since he wasn't able to drink.  The location is perfect, right next to the Gothic Quarter and a quick walk to Las Ramblas.  The Cabaret is a fun and quirky dinner/show and woudl recommend that you go a bit later (the show starts after 10PM).  Also recommend you download Cabify (similar to uber and easy to get around).   Look forward to staying here again later this year!",5,2019,07,04
41,Location Class and Next door to the St Caterina Market in the Gothic Quarters,"From the moment you step in the hotel you feel the welcoming scent, the level of service, the spacious rooms and the benefits of being close to walk everywhere. Roof top has amazing views of the city and the whole stay will wow you.  So wowed that I am going back in October and I will be booking the same hotel again.",5,2019,07,03
41,Incredible stay in the perfect BARCELONA neighborhood,"The Edition is located next door to the St Caterina Market in the Gothic/El Born neighborhood.  It is a Marriott but the service and staff make it feel like a 5* boutique hotel.  Sebastian, the concierge, arranged transportation from the airport to the hotel for my daughter and her husband,  it went seamlessly and made their first European arrival totally stress free
The hotel has the coolest rooftop bar/restaurant with an incredible view of the city.  We got the package that included a made to order breakfast each day which was oh so yummy.

The rooms are classy, sophisticated and quiet.  The staff was amazing.  They loaned us umbrellas to use on the one rainy day, had a taxi waiting anytime we needed transportation and always welcomed us back home at the end of the day.

Javier made sure my laundry was done overnight and went out of his way to say good morning every day.

I would come back in a heart beat!",5,2019,06,27
41,STAY as Far AWAY as Possible. ,"The hotel was clean but beyond that it was a disaster from start to finish. The location could improve greatly and the rooms were TINY. Service was the worst part. Not even on par with a regular Marriott, let alone an Edition or a 5 star hotel. The shower didn’t get hot and the drain didn’t drain. Would have been no big deal, but the staff response was odd. It wasn’t a language barrier. It was as if letting them know was a bother. Also they have no shuttle service, no valet circle, the gym is a joke, there have been multiple robberies right outside the front door and it now has a reputation in Barcelona as an easy place to rob someone. Nothing tragic, but it’s nothing like other Edition Hotels. The AC Hotel was far more enjoyable, with better service, for a fraction of the money. Even the decent parts of this hotel were messed up such as the beautiful rooftop that they don’t tell you is 120 square feet. No room to eat, no pool, no space. Miserable. ",1,2019,06,22
41,Top Hotel In Barcelona,"I couldn't be happier with my stay at the Edition Barcelona. I arrived an hour before check in and was surprised that my room wasn't available given my status with Marriott, but the front desk bought us drinks and made us comfortable while they quickly sorted out our room. The hotel is fantastic, the roof not to be missed, and Carlos in the Punch Room is fantastic. I only wish our layover was longer so we could spend more time at this hotel.",5,2019,06,20
41,Excellent Hotel - Rooms Odd - Great Service,"Normally I prefer Amex Fine Hotel Properties but I picked this one based on TripAdvisor reviews and my Titanium status at Marriott. It did not disappoint.

We arrived to the hotel at 10am. Check in was easy, they indicated they upgraded us but the room was not ready. The clerk offered to call me and to my delight the clerk did call! An hour later the room was ready and I was delighted to see a suite upgrade. I did book a junior suite so this is a 1 category upgrade I think. Our bags had already been delivered to the suite by the time we returned to the hotel. Excellent!

All the hotel staff were super friendly and kind. They never missed a beat. Bravo!

I do have some observations about the room. Our suite had no desk. I sat in bed to write emails. Equally, the bathroom had no hooks of any kind. Thus, we had no place to hang pajamas, a robe or our cosmetic bags. That is odd, just add some hooks please. We never figured out how to turn off the minibar area lights either. The coffee table in the seating area of our room is about 10 inches or 23cm high. It is way to low to be practical. Overall the rooms are a tad tight and our suite was no exception. That said they are appointed to a 5 star standard. 

One night we had some drinks and even played billiards at the punch room bar. The atmosphere and service were top notch.

The market next door was cool as we grabbed some wonderful seasonal fruit. The tapas style restaurant, Santa Canterina, facing the hotel lobby restaurant was a good choice for small bites. Freshly made and flavorful. There are many cafes and options all around the hotel. 

I confirm other reviewers frustration that Marriott Bonvoy benefits are limited even to top tier members at Edition properties, not sure why that makes business sense. Personally, I ate too much at dinner to care about a free breakfast but note you have many quick options around the hotel for breakfast. I did receive an in room amenity, upgrade and the early check in so I cannot profess to be upset, quite the contrary, I was pleased.

This first class hotel is ideally located for exploring the charming parts of Barcelona on foot. My wife and I would recommend the hotel.",5,2019,06,20
41,Cabaret & Food,"I enjoyed an amazing night at The Edition Hotel in the Cabaret, such an amazing space and fantastic show, It really took me to another place and time, great show! The food and service left me feeling like a king, If you're in Barcelona its a must! We were a large group and everyone enjoyed the moment, so if you like to be in a nice safe environment with great shows and food then look no further! If you want to stay on after dinner they have great Djs and live music ;)",5,2019,06,18
41,A fantastic experience!,"Went to the Cabaret downstairs in Edition on a Wednesday when they have live music, wanted to check out the band. Beautiful place to be, really excellent food (I had the duck and I was very happy) enhanced by great service. Attentive, friendly and informed without being over-bearing, intrusive or stuffy. The band (La Creme) were also spot on, lounge-y funk that perfectly complemented the ambience. A triumph all round. ",5,2019,06,18
41,Wonderful experience: Cabaret,"Spent evening in Cabaret, located in the basement area of the hotel and it was truly wonderful experience. The ambience is a lovely combination of friendly yet very professional and sophisticated. Menu is very well crafted and everything we ordered was amazing. Great selection on wines and the staff really goes above and beyond to make sure you'll have a good time. 
Even if you're not staying at the hotel, it's definitely a great place to have a dinner. Also they have live music quite often.",5,2019,06,16
41,"Wonderful Stay!  (May 28-30, 2019)","I decided to add the dates we visited since TripAdvisor sometimes gets the posted dates wrong.
Oh well! 😂

The Barcelona Edition is a modern boutique hotel that’s on a quiet side street.  It’s location in the El Born district is easily within walking distance to the Gothic Quarter.  (We even strolled all the way to the Sagrada Familia!)

The guest rooms are very stylish and clean with comfortable beds, blackout curtains, and access to Netflix on their TV system!  The bathrooms have spacious countertops, large walk-in showers, and fantastic lighting!  And in their closets, the plushest robes. . .ever!!!

There’s a rooftop bar with the most amazing views of Barcelona not to be missed.  We stopped by for drinks, even coffee, to just relax and chill and enjoy the vista!

The staff here are incredible, so personable and welcoming!  They all speak English quite well (in case your Spanish isn’t all that!).  When I left my jacket in the backseat of the private car we traveled in from the airport, Gresa at the front desk immediately took care of it and together with the concierge, they were able to contact our driver and have my jacket delivered to the hotel!!!  How’s that for great service!!!  And Gresa is always there with a greeting and a smile!!!

Thanks to this hotel for the most wonderful stay in Barcelona!  We look forward to returning soon!",5,2019,06,14

41,Excellent Staff & Spacious Rooms,This hotel opened less than a year ago in Barcelona and has really nice rooms and top notch amenities. Definitely visit the rooftop if you decide to stay here.

Will definitely be staying here in future visits to Barcelona.,4,2019,06,04

41,Work In Progress,"Decided to stay at this Marriott affiliated hotel for a night on my recent visit to Barcelona.

Hotel sent me a very confusing and contradictory email prior to my stay (full of negatives) but everything worked out at the property.

The rooms and suites are very tight, although nicely designed (what is expected from this EDITION brand).

The rooftop bar is lovely and spent some time there on both days. Some space for those wishing to catch some tan and plunge pool sized pool.

The ""experience manager"" sent me an email after the stay and I replied that I may have left something behind and could they check the suite. Never got a reply back.

The General Manager is nice gentleman and easily approachable.

Will return on my future visits to Barcelona.
",4,2019,06,04
41,Great Modern Hotel,"The rooms are all the small side,  but we managed to get a one with a  balcony that makes the whole experience worth it.  The location is not bad either,  near the gothic district.  . lol and ixc can also arrange a car from the port or airport.
Our driver was named Felix and he took care of us too.",4,2019,06,03
41,Great staff and service ,Room was a bit small but very comfortable. Bathroom and shower were adequate size. Excellent location. Staff was exceptional. Front door and front desk greeted by name and never stopped providing top service and suggestions. With their help we got t the most from our stay,5,2019,06,03
41,Disappointed check in,Staff was friendly but the hotel probably mixed up with our booking. We were told that there was a free upgrade but unfortunately after having snacks and drinks the room was not available till 5pm. This was way off the standard of Marriott hotels.,2,2019,06,02
41,The perfect place for drinks and dinner,"The Edition Hotel in Barcelona has a very nice ambience, with a cool cabaret show downstairs. The new summer menu and cocktails are just delicious - the perfect place for predrinks and an unusual dinner!",5,2019,05,29
41,amazing hidden gem,Best location! walk to gothic quarter! next door to a great market! Beautiful Catherdral next door! The hotel itself is So AWESOME!! service is outstanding! food to die for! Roof top lounge is perfect place to end your day! Alfredo was so sweet and the entire staff was great!! i will send clients here for SURE!!,5,2019,05,28
41,Can't find any fault with the hotel!,"Fantastic location, fantastic service. Am a huge fan of speakeasies and loved the ""Punch Room""...The Kublai Khan concoction was the best cocktail I have ever had. Service was extremely personal and warm, something that is not easy in a hotel of this size.",5,2019,05,25
41,Unforgivable Service,"I am a Titanium level Marriott member and expected to be able to rely on the concierge to bother to book me reservations in restaurants when I requested them 2 months before my visit. Instead, they failed to make the reservations and then provided me with three different reasons (i.e., lies) for that failure. Then they made sure that I could not write a review in the Marriott system, which means their reviewing system is unreliable as well if they can prevent unhappy guests from warning others. The hotel is in a great location and should be a great choice. But there are many other options and I recommend looking into them. ",1,2019,05,25
41,"What a perfect ""home base"" for our first trip to Barcelona!","I loved everything about this beautiful hotel! The service was excellent from the moment we walked through the door (special shout outs to Javier, Rodrigo, and Alejo!) The rooms have a modern ""boutique"" feel, The location is close enough to the places you want to be, but far enough away from the more active spots that you can get some peace and quiet. And you cannot beat the views from the rooftop bar! When we next return to Barcelona, we would stay here and a heartbeat!",5,2019,05,20
41,Great but just shy of amazing,"I wanted so badly to fall in love with this hotel! I had previously stayed at the London Edition and so we booked a trip to BCN specifically so we could stay in another Edition property. While the property in Barcelona is great, it's not quite as awesome as I had hoped and not as great as the one in London.
The staff here are fantastic- everyone was accommodating and friendly and we loved the waitstaff in the Punch Room in particular. The hotel rooms are gorgeous and the decor is just as excellent as you'd expect, plus the le Labo products are great. All in all, the experience here was a good one and I am Marriott Titanium so I stay frequently. 
I hesitate to say there are negatives, but there are areas that left something to be desired. Nothing major.
- The pool is not heated. It was too cold to use in mid May which is disappointing, especially for how small it is. There are also a distracting amount of fake plants on the roof which for me took away from the experience up there. The rooftop is great, but not huge. And I didn't like how few chips they gave me for my guac, haha. They crumpled up a ball of paper to make it look like there were more in the bowl. 
- The lobby is small and not exciting. When we arrived, there were people everywhere and it felt chaotic and not chic or relaxed. And I know this is nitpicky, but automatic doors into the lobby from the outside would be great. Instead it's these huge heavy doors that the doorman was only able to open around half the time for us. Again, no biggie, but first impressions mean a lot. It was not the grand arrival you get in London.  The staff were all excellent, my only comment would be with the earpieces. It makes them seem detached or like they have more important priorities going on in their ear than the people in front of them. 

This hotel is great, no question. It's just not quite as epic as I had hoped for.",4,2019,05,17
41,The staff make this hotel amazing !!!!,"The front desk staff made my stay amazing !!!!     Not as beautiful as the Edition Hotel in Miami or London but its very well located in Barcelona.  Rather small rooms but cozy.  Nice gym.  I bit overpriced for what it is, i would not pay more than 375. for this type of rooms.",4,2019,05,17
41,5 star,I love this hotel! They treat you like royalty. Not only did I feel like a queen! They have the best of everything you want. The cocktail area is so nice . Down stairs has an amazing show called the Cabaret. It’s the coolest show you will ever see. The staff is nice and the people are so fashionable. ,5,2019,05,15
41,Nearly Perfect,"My wife and I decided to book the Edition after reading the reviews although the property is on the newer side. We are absolutely glad that we did as the stay was amazing. As many have mentioned before, the décor is modern which sets the tone. We were celebrating a special occasion and the staff went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great time. Not enough space to reflect on all of the small touches. Everything we requested was top notch. The rooftop is a must for both the views as well as the food/drink. The staff was great and Nelson makes a great beverage. Again, others have stated this but the location can't be beat. You have a great market next door and you can walk to Las Ramblas. Suggestion, while Ramblas is the more popular spend more time walking the Gothic Quarter and Born area which have a more authentic feel. Special thank you to Oriel who was amazing throughout the stay and even before. Also, Javier at the front desk helped during check in which allowed us to enjoy more of the city. The only little downside was Caberet. The show was great and I recommend it but the food did leave something to be desired. That aside, we will be back to the Edition.",5,2019,05,15
41,Wonderful location and friendly staff,"The location is perfect.  The room was comfortable--quiet with great bed.  The clothing storage was very limited for two people.  Would have liked a tub, but the shower was excellent.  The rooftop is a must do. The market next door is awesome.  

The Cabaret was interesting on Saturday night.  The performers were talented.  The dinner was one of the worst we have ever had--5 of 6 courses were not good.  I would not recommend the Cabaret overall, although I feel bad saying that because the performers and servers worked so hard.  I think if the food had been better, it would have been worth it.",4,2019,05,14
41,Very fashionable,WiFi worked well. Quiet room if a bit small. Very stylish rooftop bar and lobby.  Surprisingly our room was not ready at 5:30 but we only had to wait 10-15 minutes and were offered free drinks. Hard to beat a very good location right next to Santa Caterina market and the Cathedral.,5,2019,05,11
41,Great location and cool hospital,"Funky, very non Spanish hotel in a central Barcelona location.  The roof top bar is a gem and a great way to see in the afternoon.  The rooms are cosy but beautifully laid out and the punch bar is a real surprise.",4,2019,05,10
41,Fantastic location and concierge service,My husband and I stayed at the Barcelona Edition for 5 nights.  The location was a perfect base to explore the city.  The concierge and the staff at reception were fantastic.  The concierge answered all of our questions and helped us plan our excursions.  The room was clean and well designed.  The only part of our stay which we thought could be improved was the breakfast.  We would have preferred a buffet breakfast.  Service at breakfast was hit or miss.  We would not have eaten here if breakfast was not included in our rate as Marriott Reward members.,5,2019,05,09
41,Perfection In Every Way!,"Its been awhile since I've been inspired to post a review of a hotel and then I entered the doors of The Edition Hotel in Barcelona! The lobby was busy, but that didn't keep the front desk staff from acknowledging us with smiles and letting us know they would be with us shortly. The attention and time they took with the guest ahead of us set the tone for what I knew would be a great experience. First I'll start with the environment of the hotel...this is a sexy, hip, but inviting place to stay or visit. (The rooftop bar is a must! Great cocktails!) Sexy, hip hotels are a dime a dozen and sometimes not the most inviting or welcoming atmosphere. What makes this hotel stand out is the service! It didn't matter if it was the bellman, the concierge, front desk staff, or housekeeping. Across the board this property delivered the best service in a friendly professional manner. I've been lucky to stay in some amazing properties all over the globe and this hotel stands out as #1! We also felt that the location was one of the best spots you could be in Barcelona. Minutes to the Picasso museum, in the Born neighborhood with some of the best tapas restaurants down every narrow cobbled street. We will be back!",5,2019,05,02
41,Best of the Best,We like the  Marriott brand but wanted a boutique hotel in the center of town.  We found the Barcelona Edition and we were treated like royalty.  This hotel is beautiful yet minimalist .  The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful.  The manager introduced himself and we discussed the concept of the hotel.  The rooms are elegant and beautifully appointed.  The lobby is friendly and is next to a restaurant.  The roof top lounge and restaurant are FANTASTIC!  I can not express my joy of having found this hotel and chain.  I plan to go again in the future.,5,2019,05,01
41,"Unbeatable location, great service, well appointed rooms","Love this hotel! The location is fantastic - right near the Cathedral and Gothic Quarter, next to Santa Caterina Market and close to hop on bus and cab stand. The rooms do not wow at first but they are so thoughtfully appointed! Smart controls manage the lights and the window shades from the bed. The bathroom is huge and again, simple in appearance but incredibly luxurious. You sink into the complimentary robe and just feel pampered. The staff are very attentive. More than once when I was heading to my room with full hands the doorman rushed for the elevator to wave the security card and knew what floor I was headed for. The rooftop bar with incredible views capped off the experience. We hated to leave!",5,2019,04,28
41,"Fantastic location with incredible service, great food and a hipster vibe","With a location right in the center of the Gothic Quarter ,and steps from Santa Catarina Market and the Cathedral, the new Edition Hotel adds a touch of cool sophistication to the many Marriott properties in Barcelona.  
The staff is eager to please and well informed, the bar and restaurant offer both traditional and unique takes on Spanish cuisine. Great craft cocktails on the beautiful rooftop bar top off the experience. The rooms are spacious, dominated by dark woods and a 50” LCD TV.  A great choice.",5,2019,04,13
41,The best view and service ever!,"My partner and I went to spend a romantic weekend in Barcelona and we made the best choice by choosing The Barcelona Edition. Their rooms are just amazing and their terrace to die for. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful at all times. 
They also have a cabaret show during the night time and the sala is so unbelievable beautiful.  Caring for small details and really near of the famous Cathedral, el Born and Portal de l'angel shopping street. Simply and truthfully amazing. ",5,2019,04,10
41,Lifestyle right at the heart of Barcelona,"Another WOW hotel from Edition - great clean lines in the room, functional design and wonderful people throughout..The team's service spirit is marked by friendliness, attentiveness and just being really nice - this makes the hotel a stand-out! The great location just steps of the Cathedral and the Gothic quarter or the hop-on bus is just a really nice benefit.",5,2019,04,10
41,Wonderful!,"I’ve stayed at EDITION properties in New York and Miami and really enjoyed those stays. However, The Barcelona EDITION blew me away! The property is modern and chic with a highly attentive staff. Many thanks to the guest relations, housekeeping and concierge staff for exceeding my expectations. 

I am already looking at my calendar to plan a future stay.",5,2019,04,08
41,Stylish and classy ,"Everything about the Barcelona Edition is done with a touch of class, from the attentiveness of the front of house staff to the attention to detail in the whole hotel. From the moment we arrived we were made feel so welcome and that continued to the moment we left. The location of the hotel is just superb as there are so many amazing things to see and do within walking distance. As a city centre hotel it’s got everything you need, the rooms are stylish and very comfortable, the lobby and  dining area are lovely and the breakfasts we had were delicious. The rooftop bar is fabulous and the bar on the first floor is opulent with a cool vibe. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning to Barcelona and the Edition at some point in the future. ",5,2019,04,06
41,Just beautiful,"Such a beautiful hotel, very special decor choices. The location  was very central to everything in old Barcelona. Rooms were extremely clean, ALL the staff were amazing and helpful, going out of their way to make our stay amazing! The rooftop bar has the best, 360 degree view of the city, great food and drinks 🍸. Highly recommend! ",5,2019,03,31
41,Kindest front desk agent,"We only passed by for a drink in the bar on the first floor. Upon leaving, the front desk agent, Gabriel, informed us, 3 girls, to keep caution when walking outside the hotel, even showing us where we could find a taxi. Even though we weren't staying at the hotel, he demonstrated true care, a quality we deeply appreciated. Please send our best wishes to Gabriel, and thank you for the great drinks at the bar! Will definitely come back soon!",5,2019,03,27
41,Best stay ever,"We stayed at the Edition by Marriott. The associates were over the top helpful. It had recently opened and I have never had that level of service. Definitely on par with a Ritz Carlton.
I waited to long to write this review, I especially wanted to thank Oscar, Ricardo and the bartender that unfortunately now can’t remember his name.",5,2019,03,20
41,Lovely friendly hotel in great location,"This hotel is friendly and the rooms were well appointed. The room was a decent size for a city hotel and furnished very nicely. The bars were great and cocktails well worth having. 
The cabaret was an “experience” a bit surreal.... and we are glad we did it as it made for a fun first night in the city. 
The only downside was that the food wasn’t that good, a bit over thought and not great flavours or textures. It wasn’t awful, just not what I might have expected in a 5 star, and we only ate the night of the Caberet as a result and had breakfast.
Also we had a deal that included breakfast and we wanted room service and instead of a surcharge they charged us for the whole breakfast which we weren’t expecting! 
We would definitely stay again as overall it was a very handy location, friendly service and lovely ambience, and for a 5 star it was good value.",4,2019,03,17
41,"Nice design, great location, lovely staff","Everything was delightful here.  The location is terrific -- across the street from the Santa Caterina market and in the midst of the El Born neighborhood.  It's quiet because there isn't much of a street in front.  The rooms are very well designed; you get a sort of bay window to sit and and look at the street. Best of all, every person on the staff was friendly and helpful.  And the toiletries were also well chosen.
I was very glad I chose this hotel.",5,2019,03,15
41,5 Stars and 100 Stars for service ,"This place was amazing and our stay was absolutely wonderful.  We were here for 6 days and loved it.  The hotel went above and beyond for our family and made us feels so comfortable.  The food at both the restaurant and rooftop bar was amazing, the drinks at their speakeasy the Punch Room were also great.  The whole atmosphere of the hotel is very modern and cool but also relaxing at the same time. I can’t put into words how enjoyable it was.

The only drawbacks I saw were our room was a little smaller (but the bathroom was huge).  By European standards, I think it was a normal sized hotel room, I am just used to bigger rooms. I also wish we had gotten the upgraded view - next time we’d definitely do that.

Besides that though, I’d give 100 stars for service if I could.  They made us and our baby feel so welcome.  The staff went above and beyond in every aspect possible for us and were kind and friendly every day.  They really made it a wonderful experience and I’d have to say their service and hospitality far exceeded any other luxury hotel I’ve stayed at.  Also, the location is fantastic.  It’s a block from the Barcelona Cathedral and you can walk to so much in the area.

Thanks to the staff at the Edition for such a wonderful stay!  We will definitely be back!",5,2019,03,10
41,excellent location,"My husband and I stayed here for four nights.  The location couldn't have been more perfect right in the heart of everything. We originally had booked the Hotel Arts and the W but we are so glad we changed since they were a bit of a hike from the places we wanted to visit. I took the very convenient Aerobus from the airport and it was a quick walk from Placa Catalunya (ignore all the zigzags that google maps takes you on and stick to the main streets or you may get lost if this is your first time here!  many ""streets"" are actually narrow alleys and easy to miss!) Many restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores, bodegas, etc. very close by if you want to pick up water, wine or snacks. We had a room overlooking Santa Caterina market which is so pretty especially from above. The front desk personnel were amazing...so professional, friendly and helpful and remembered our names throughout our stay.  The guys working the front doors (security? bellmen? not sure what their role was exactly) were hit or miss.  Sometimes they opened the door, sometimes they watched as you did but that's ok, it didn't really matter.  The room was sparse but clean and comfortable.  I enjoyed the window seat.  The bed was extremely comfortable and I loved the faux fur blanket. I wish there were outlets, not just AUX, next to the beds and I wish that there were universal outlets or at least adaptors available in the rooms.  Otherwise this is a great hotel and I would definitely stay again on my next visit.",5,2019,03,04
41,Fantastic short stay in Barcelona,"My girlfriend and I stayed there recently and I can only recommend it ! 
Beautiful hotel and facilities. The rooms are modern and spacious. The rooftop bar has a view overlooking the whole city. The classy cocktail bar is a must go to try their delicious old fashioned.
Last but not least, the staff gave us a very warm welcome and everyone was very helpful and friendly, such as Gabriel who welcomed us at the desk and gave us great tips for our barcelona visit.",5,2019,02,22
41,Amazing staff and great location!!!!,"We just returned from 4 nights at the Barcelona Edition and we cannot say enough great things about it!  The hotel is in a great location.  2 min walk to the Gothic area and Las Ramblas.  Very funky cool hotel with 3 bars-we really only went to the Rooftop Lounge and the late night to The Punch room. The Punchroom bartender and staff are not to be missed. 
Huge shout to Gabriel Perez at the front desk, he was amazing and so accommodating.  He truly went out of his way to make us happy.  The rooms and very clean, nice and well appointed, but SMALL. We ended up in room 406 gorgeous and large.  Sabastian and Antonio at the concierge desk were very helpful and available to help you with reservations and recommendations.   The staff at this hotel is truly outstanding and go above and beyond.  We can’t wait to return.",5,2019,02,21
41,Not for drinks!!!!!,"Tiny measures. Very uncomfortable seats by the bar plus bartender with attitude. I don’t have more to say! Go for drinks somewhere else. Do yourself a favor. Many placer better than this one. I can’t say about the rooms.
",2,2019,02,19
41,BEST STAFF IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!,"I've traveled to a 120 countries and stayed in more hotels than I can count but I have never experienced a hotel team as Excellent as the staff at The Barcelona Edition!
Correspondence prior to arrive - Bell Staff at the Entrance - Front Desk - ALL amazing!!
Rooms in the Edition are the brands quality and design but newer and fresh!  Roof Top lounge is delightful with amazing views. First floor lounge so cool and fun.
Restaurant once again WONDERFUL service and staff offering delicious food - Service and food was so good that I ate breakfast and dinner there nightly! 
The Edition's Cabaret - a FUN experience that's a weekend must!!! Nothing like it in Barcelona - it's not really a cabaret but a real entertaining evening of drink/food and entertainment!! SO FUN - I spent my birthday there. Best birthday ever!
Congratulations to whoever put this amazing staff together!! 
THANK YOU ALL for making my 2 stays with you so wonderful - Barcelona Edition service makes me want to return over and over again !",5,2019,02,07
41,Top level service in a great location ,"We stayed in Rm 502 for three nights.  The staff is outstanding, professional at every turn, going out of their way to ensure guests needs are met. The hotel is new and modern, with top amenities. The linens were plush and nothing was lacking. The rooftop restaurant and lounge was beautiful, though we only went up to view.
The location is perfect. Right by the tour bus stop, walking distance to the MACBA, waterfront and old city, with many fantastic dining options.I would definitely consider returning to stay while in Barcelona. 
",5,2019,02,07
41,"Great Location, Unrivaled Service","Where to start. The Barcelona Edition hit on all cylinders. Location is my number one criteria and the Edition is perfect. It's right between the Born and the Barrio Gotic. It's only a few blocks from metro and has dining and a market right around the corner.

The service was unsurpassed. Everyone always greeted me with a smile and went out of their way to help. 

The room was quite large and up to date. The bed was comfortable and the shower was huge and (critically important) held the correct temperature.

I ate at the restaurant only for breakfast and it was good, including a morning paper.

I also had a beer at the Roof Top bar. It gets crowded and can be tough to order. And bring a jacket because it gets cold when the sun goes down.

I'll stay here again.",5,2019,02,05
41,Fantastic stay at The Edition ,"Having perviously stayed at W , I enjoyed my stay much better at the Edition.  The rooms were nice and the location was perfect. The best part was the service - right from reception , bell boy Martin to the waiters at the roof provided excellent service which did make us feel special.

Food is good as well.
Overall a great stay.

",5,2019,02,01
41,A true gem,"The barcelona edition is a true gem. Authentic service, sincere and personal attention and constant pampering. My wife and have stayed at many highly recommended hotels world wide. We have yet to stay at a hotel that literally attended to our needs before we even made a request. The location is outstanding, the decor is exemplary and the employees are professional in every possible way.",5,2019,01,27
41,Great Hotel and Location,This hotel has a perfect location for walking to the best areas in Barcelona. The staff and accommodations were very good as well. The new rooftop bar is worth a visit with nice views and an interesting drink menu.,5,2019,01,26
41,A must stay in Barcelona!!,"We recently completed a 2 night stay at the Barcelona EDITION, and are incredibly happy with the experience we had.  We traveled in a group of 6, 3 couples and from the moment we booked our reservations to the moment we left we were extremely satisfied with the experience.  A few weeks before our reservation, we received a pre-arrival e-mail welcoming us and asking if there were any questions about our upcoming reservations. The team at the EDITION were always professional in the correspondence especially since we had to make a last minute room addition. We were checked in by Javier who gave us some local tips. Quickly after checking in, we went to the rooftop for some cocktails. The views of the city were amazing, highly recommended. Over the next 2 days everyone we interacted with either at the front desk or food and beverage outlets were top notch.  The location of the hotel is perfect, i highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,01,26
41,Amazing Hotel Experience,"The Barcelona EDITION hotel is an excellent choice if you are planning as trip to Barcelona. It is a very new property, the hotel and rooms are very modern, and of course everything is very clean. The highlight of this hotel is the staff by far. Never have I stayed in a hotel with a staff as helpful and attentive as this hotel. Every time I walked in I was greeted by name, and asked how my day was going. The front desk staff and the concierge were beyond helpful when we had a question. What really sealed the deal for myself and my family was this: We were flying in to Barcelona from Malaga on a flight that ended up being four hours delayed (thanks Vueling...). We had tickets to the FC Barcelona match that night and were already cutting it close if the flight was on time. I called the concierge to arrange a car to pick us up and take us straight to the game, hold our bags, etc. I made several phone calls to the concierge and everything was arranged perfectly. Unfortunately, Vueling had so sense of urgency at all and by the time we were collecting our bags in Barcelona the match had ended. (Please note that we missed the game were Messi scored his 400th goal.) Anyway, by the time we arrived at the hotel the whole staff knew that we had missed the game; they were very apologetic and offered to set up a viewing party for us, but we declined as we were more interested in being at the stadium. They even jokingly offered to kick around a ball for us in the lobby, we appreciated the sense of humor after a long day! On our final night we arrived back to our rooms and found a surprise there (see pictures). The staff that had been there when we arrived gave us some FC Barcelona gear and a note saying how they felt bad we missed the game and wanted to make sure we left Barcelona on a good note. That act was the highest level of service that I could have ever expected from a hotel. If I'm ever in Barcelona again, I know where I will be staying!",5,2019,01,25
41,Great Food Great vibes!,"This was a spur of the moment trip when our trip to Amsterdam got sidelined but what a treat! My sister, my mother, and I decided to fly from Paris to Barcelona instead.  We arrived around 11pm the evening before my sister’s birthday.  It was late but the restaurant was still able to accommodate us and and even put a candle in the desert for my sister!  Our waitress, Candelaria was really kind.  She took her time and didn’t make us feel rushed. The food was amazing and all contributed to us having a great time.  The front desk and bell staff was also extremely accommodating which was even more appreciated.  The next day we went out and enjoyed the wonderful location which was in walking distance from shopping and a city bus tour.",5,2019,01,09
41,Rooftop bar,The rooftop bar has amazing views of Barcelona. We arrived on a Friday night party of six (2 were teenagers). We were giving the option to seat inside or out. We ordered a bottle of red wine and enjoyed it outside. I am not sure if they have a food menu. We didn’t stay long but enjoyed the view and nice weather on a December night. We will return and possible stay at hotel during our next visit to Barcelona.,4,2019,01,07
41,Enjoy the Cabaret as if you were in 1920,"FIRST: this review if not of the hotel, but the Cabaret club downstairs, belonging to the hotel anyway. 
This new venue really impressed me, not a big place but so cool and beautiful inside. The bar is just perfect, they have a large collection of beverages, awesome shows and fantastic ambience. Really worth the visit at least one night. New year's eve was a blast!!!",4,2019,01,07
41,Great boutique hotel,"Very wonderful 3 nights stay in Barcelona EDITION. The experience was flawless from checkin to checkout. The breakfast is the best I had so far: it’s a la carte but all included if you’ve got breakfast in your room rate. High quality omelette, waffles and juices.",5,2019,01,07
41,Our new favourite in Barcelona,"The staff, the rooms, the restaurants, the views .... simply it is THE EDITION. We visit Barcelona frequently and were excited about the opening of this new hotel as it is located in one of our favourite areas to stay. With any new hotel we weren't sure what to expect but from the moment we arrived we were not disappointed. The staff were incredibly accommodating and the rooms are sophisticated yet so very comfortable. If you like bathrooms we recommend booking the loft room as it has possibly one of the largest hotel showers we have experienced and there is also a free standing bathtub. 
The roof top bar is sensational and the food is some of the best we have ever tasted, it is far from the typical hotel food you expect from chain hotels. I'd go as far as to say that the fish tacos at the Roof Bar are some of the best we have ever tasted and don't miss the bao lamb. The cocktails are also something else and its great seeing Sake on the menu.
As a side note we were travelling with our children and the hotel made our children feel so very welcome, Leo at the main bar was especially welcoming to them and one of the guys at the Roof Bar even taught our children bar tricks. On the evening of the Three Kings celebration the hotel went as far as to decorate the room for our children, it was all very special. 
Honestly this hotel thought of everything and I know that in writing this I will have left off some of the other small personal touches they provided. 
In short, I highly recommend a stay here.",5,2019,01,06
41,New year ,"Amazing hotel , great staff one young man in particular named Oscar was super welcoming and showed us around the hotel, he had very good information about the hotel and near by and was very helpful !  The hotel itself is exceptional and the rooftop is beautiful, and the rooms are wonderful, clean and well equipped. Would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2018,12,31
41,Family Vacation,"A family catch up in Barcelona with my parents in Barcelona and we stayed together in this new hotel.  As a family we were impressed with the level of service and attention to detail.
The rooms are beautiful, exceptionally clean and great service provided by staff. The restaurant in the hotel, Bar Veraz, offers goodt drinks and great food.  The hotel is well located across from the cathedral of Barcelona.",5,2018,12,30
41,Wonderful experience.,"Enjoyed our return visit with the family to Barcelona staying at one of the newest hotels for the city.  We enjoyed wonderful and glamourous rooms, super service, helpful staff.  Well equipped rooms, lovely roof top bar and centrally located.",5,2018,12,29
41,"Upscale intentions, need differentiated service for Marriott Platinum members","Let me start by saying how well-trained and intended the staff are at this place.  We thoroughly enjoyed our room and having happy hour on the roof top each night.  The front desk and concierge were informational and accommodating.  The only problem I have with this place is how expensive it is - cost us 60,000 Marriott pts/night and as a loyal Platinum member, there wasn't anything that really differentiated my stay from anyone else, other than some occasional sweets left in the room.  For example, at the W, another Marriott/Starwood property in BCN, they have complimentary drinks/snacks and a meet and greet for Platinums with the GM on their top level, which has an incredible view of the city.  At the Marriott Grand Cayman, there's a loyalty happy hour every night.  At the BCN Edition, there's nothing - no concierge room, let alone free-breakfast in lieu of this service or even happy hour/snacks, etc.  I know this sounds trite but when you travel a lot and blow a bunch of points in an expensive city, these little differentiators add up.  We tried to mention something to the GM while we were there in-person on three separate occasions, but the GM never made time to do that.  Had to turn to Marriott Rewards.  Again, well-trained and hospitable staff!  ",3,2018,12,26
41,"Location, Stylish, Cabaret","Perfect location in the city center, very elegant and stylish rooms, tasty a la carte breakfast, night show - cabaret + night club. Very good choice for couples and singles. I like their bath amenities, and buy their candles. They smell amazing! Magnificent 360' view from their roof top bar. It's so cool to have a glass of the champagne at the sunset.",5,2018,12,25
41,You’ll love it here!,"I can’t say enough about our stay here. From the moment our taxi pulled up we received the most friendly, warm and and capable service I believe I’ve ever had in a hotel. The concierge was helpful and gave us excellent recommendations for restaurants and nightlife, and the staff in the Punch Room were sweet and welcoming. Definitely check out the Punch Room for the sexy yet low key vibe, and EXCELLENT cocktails! The whole hotel is modern yet cozy and welcoming. Our room was immaculate and very comfortable. In terms of location, we couldn’t have been happier. Super walkable to the main attractions, but not directly in the thick of it. Again, I can’t emphasize enough what a wonderful time we had staying here.",5,2018,12,23
41,Fantastic hotel in the gotic area ,"Location is great
Service is fantastic
Room is super clean
Bed is comfortable
Temperature control works great
It is on the smaller size, but  not the bathroom which is big and comfy for two people
I will stay here again on my next visit and will highly recommended to others
Front desk , and concierges are great 
It is a new hotel so it also look very nice ",5,2018,12,19
41,Nice Hotel with friendly service,"This is a new hotel in Barcelona. It is part of the Marriott group. 

I was impressed by the kindness of the staff, especialli Ignassi who went out of his way to accompany me to the restaurant in the market next door and get me a table from the waitress, and also Sonia who went out of her at 23:30 to make sure i could be served in the restaurant by the kitchen and gave me a choice of dishes and recommendations in spite of the late hour.  

The room was a little small but nicely appointed and comfortable.  The only negative point was a smell of sewer coming from the bath room pipes and giving the smell to the whole room. After i closed the bathroom door left open by the house keeper the smell dissipated in the room. The room is well soundproofed and the bed comfortable.  The temperature needed adjustment as it was a little cold. 

The hotel is in the heart of the city very near the cathedral and access to sites is good. ",4,2018,12,16
41,Hip Hotel,"My husband and I recently stayed at The Edition for four nights and really had a great stay.  The room we had (a superior) was beautifully appointed and even though the window was on the street, we heard no noise at all.  The bed was super comfy and the gowns the highest quality I have ever encountered.  The exclusive Le Labo toiletries are such a sophisticated touch.   We ordered room service one night which was prompt and delicious and great value for a five star hotel.  We had a drink at the funky rooftop bar - would love to enjoy this in the summer months.  We had breakfast every day (which was an upgraded inclusion) which was great also.  Our comments to each other when we left were how young and professional the staff at this hotel are.  The location is perfect, away from the rabble enough but close enough to enjoy it with a short stroll.  The location to the Christmas markets and La Catedral make it an even more tempting choice. ",5,2018,12,15
41,Perfect location!,"I just loved its location and the view from my room! Probably one of the best view to El Born neighborhood, specially if you are looking at it from your private balcony! The design of the property is pretty nice: modern, minimalist, and warm. Staff is pretty servicial and always ready to help in anything that you need! Chef Sebastian Mazzola and Sussie Villarico made some amazing dishes with latin and asian fusion!! If you can go for lunch/dinner in the rooftop restaurant, don’t think it twice!",5,2018,12,14
41,So lovely....,What a delightful surprise.  This is a stunning hotel right next to a spectacular market.  The Roof has a gorgeous view of the city with comfy sitting!  The customer service is not forgettable!  The Edition is centrally located and state of the art!,5,2018,12,12
41,Amazing boutique hotel in Barcelona with exceptional customer service!,"We finished our week long trip in Barcelona and decided to stay at the Edition hotel based on reviews and location.  We were not disappointed!  The entire staff we encountered goes above and beyond to make you feel special.  From the front desk, front door, all the bars, and even the room service.  I stay at Marriott/SPG properties over 100 nights per year and this is the BEST customer service I have received in 2018!  I was upgraded to a larger corner room with an excellent comfortable bed and large bathroom with a huge square bath tube and spacious shower.  The hotel even had a welcome cheesecake in my room to recognize my status.  The rooftop bar and terrace is a great way to start and end your day.  Amazing views and service.  Each night we came back to the hotel we finished with a cocktail at the Punch room bar where Ana and her staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.  Ana and her bartender (forget his name) were awesome and even provided us with a day worth of sight seeing tips which we did!  Thanks for scheduling our last day Ana!  The location is and a perfect part to explore Barcelona and a short walk to the busy La Ramblas area.  Also very close to the Picasso museum and tons of restaurants and bars.  It is next door to a very cool market as well.  Again I can't say enough about this hotel and I highly recommend staying here if your in Barcelona.  Thanks Edition staff!",5,2018,12,09
41,Highly Recomended,"We absolutely loved this hotel. Opened in July 2018. Our room was Super Clean with none of that yukky hotel room feeling. 
The staff are knowledgeable, kind and attentive. 
We especially recommend Gresa (speaks English) and is an awesome professional intern associate.  Because of Gresa we will definitely return to this hotel. 
Albert was our other favorite associate. He speaks perfect English and walked us out to our Uber car with our luggage after check out!  
There are other associates who made our stay pleasant: Diana (?)From the Ukraine, a young man from Brussels who speaks French and their Supervisor Stephanie W.
The location in Born was perfect. The hotel is right in the heart of the City. We were able to walk to the Picasso Museum. 
Don’t hesitate to stay at this beautiful hotel!",5,2018,11,30
41,"Superb, with all the Barcelona charm and class","My wife & I have had the pleasure of now staying at the Barcelona Edition on 2 occasions, literally just when opened and again last week.
Location is perfect with easy access to beach (even in winter worth a stroll) and for sightseeing, Cathedral literally across the road, Las Ramblas 5 min walk.
The hotel: small for an Edition as only has 100 rooms but for me this makes it even better.
Roof top restaurant, managed by Mathilda who could not have been more helpful, she & her staff attentive at all times without being pushy, a refreshing 'Claro' alongside the dip pool, was perfect. Food served was described as 'Asian fusion', absolutely amazing, had the pleasure of meeting the head chef Sebastián Mazzola, his passion & skill super obvious in the dishes presented, loved it
Bar wise the Barcelona Edition has its signature 'Punch room@ run by Ana, again right on the money, she and her staff welcomed us with huge energy, smiles galore and the ambience was superb, from the stunning pool table to the punch menu, a few of which I tried, the welcome with a glass of the daily punch a lovely touch 
Room: beautiful room with small sitting area, luxurious comfy bed, 
p.s We had the pleasure of going to a Cabaret night, 6 course menu, again by Sebastián, food was incredible, the show a little whacky, a first for us but a brilliant night.
I have the pleasure of visiting Barcelona on a regular basis, this hotel is up there with the best, *****",5,2018,11,28
41,Perfect,"We received an upgrade to a high level corner room. The room and the bathroom is exceptional. From the pillows to the soap to the gowns and towels is of the highest quality. Breakfast exceptional. Good gym on site. The staff professional, helpful and extremely friendly. Will definately go back.",5,2018,11,24
41,Great Hotel. Very Small Rooms,"Great People, nice hotel. Amazing location. I was ill and they too extra special care of me.  Important to note the room are TINY about 150 sq ft smaller than the most basic room ar any hotel.  For me it was a factor, for you it may not be.",3,2018,11,22
41,"Chic, Upscale Hotel","The Edition was perfect in every way.  My fiancé came for a conference and stayed at the hotel for a few days then I joined him for a few days.  The hotel staff took care of our every need with pleasure.  

The rooms were well appointed, clean, and modern.  They had several places to eat and bars/lounges that were fun and interesting.  We never had to leave the hotel if we didn’t want to.

The hotel was within walking distance of restaurants and shopping, but not on a bustling street, which made the location ideal.  We would be happy to stay here again and would recommend it highly to others!",5,2018,11,18
41,Modern  chic..great location,"this new hotel is in a great location...next to the Mercado Saint Catherine....which has a great restaurant...  so does the neighborhood have many
hotel staff is GREAT... rooms are on the small side  but who cares...hotel is HIP AND IN..go for it",5,2018,11,17
41,very nice new boutique hotel,What a great addition to the already strong Marriott/SPG presence in Barcelona. This very stylish new hotel is in the very center of historic Barcelona. Great Spanish-inspired fusion food available at the bar/restaurant downstairs.,5,2018,11,15
41,Great stay,"I spent four days with my partner in a combined business/pleasure trip. This new hotel has a number of very positive attributes as well as a very nice and helpful staff. Location is also perfect with walking distance to both the sea, La Rambla as well as the major shopping and restaurant districts. The rooms are well designed with big bathrooms and a very comfortable bed. The AC is very effective as well. Could return any time.",5,2018,11,07
41,The Barcelona Edition treats you like family!,"I highly recommend this boutique hotel!  From the time my husband & I arrived until we left 5 days later, we felt that we had been staying with good friends. The entire staff was friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Gabrielle at the front desk was especially welcoming and Martin, the busboy, gave us many wonderful suggestions. We enjoyed delicious breakfasts in the hotel dining room every morning where the servers took very good care of us each time. The roof top bar has spectacular views of the city and makes you feel like you are on top of the world. Our room was upgraded to include a window seat coach area which was so inviting. The hotel is in a great location for walking to several top tourist attractions, bars, restaurants, shops, as well as being directly next door to a lovely food market. We have already discussed returning for another visit to the fabulous Barcelona Edition!",5,2018,11,05
41,Best Hotel of my Life,"I can recommend this hotel 100% and more. I've been to a lot of Marriott and SPG Hotels around the world, but the Edition in Barcelona is my absolute favorite so far. It's even better than the Edition in London. Room amazing, rooftop bar AMAZING, bar downstairs amazing, punch room amazing. Food amazing! If I die, this will be my heaven. Love it and will return!!! ",5,2018,11,03
41,First visit to Barcelona ,A very trendy boutique hotel very well located in the center of Barcelona. A 1 minute walk to the hop on hop of bus. We had a beautiful breakfast this morning and a lovely light dinner in the bar last night. Looking forward to the Halloween dinner tonight. A great place to stay and a Marriott affiliated hotel. ,5,2018,10,31
41,great hotel,"Normally when I go to Barcelona I stay in the W hotel, but this time I decided to try The Edition and I.m glad I did it. It's such a wonderful hotel and the staff was lovely as well. They were so kind and upgraded me and also allowed me a late check out at 6 p.m. I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone who goes to Barcelona. Location is also super convenient. The roof bar is great as well with the beautiful view.",5,2018,10,27
41,Great trendy hotel,"We liked everything almost about this hotel. Great bar area, rooms, rooftop pool and even had fitness center that was good. The staff was really nice and very helpful. Our room was clean and the bed was comfy. Our only small complaints were that the tv had only 2 english news stations and our room was not cleaned up until 4 in the afternoon. Everything else was really great!",5,2018,10,24
41,Best stay in Barcelona,"Hotel is very tastefully done with a lot of thoughts to the design to give hotel stayers a great experience.

Rooms are very clean and sheltered from street noise. The bathroom was something that gives me a very cozy feeling where I felt that it was part of the room. The toilet is well ensuite for stayers with elder and wheel chairs but still look very stylish.

Market and restaurant were just next to the hotel. There is a very nice roof top bar to see the great view of the city and the sea. Definitely must go up to take some pictures. There is also a dip pool if the weather is warm next to the bar.

It is so convenient to travel to shopping area and tourist attraction around the area.

Overall, it is definitely a safe,great and comfortable stay.",5,2018,10,24
41,New great hotel with sky lounge terrace in the heart of Born,"Amazing new spot in the heart of Borne to enjoy great drinks and remarkable view of the fabulous Barcelona. Great service, cocktails and fresh new interior makes the spot being Must Visit when you want to stop and enjoy calm in Barcelona city center.  ",5,2018,10,19
41,Fantastic stay at the Barcelona Edition,"Wonderful new hotel in the heart of Barcelona.  Room was nice sized for European standards.  Staff was friendly.  Roof top bar / restaurant is very chic and the night we were there it poured rain but the staff was fantastic and the small plates were very good.

Looking to grab a cab in the AM on a rainy day was so difficult and we had a tour time set for Sagrada Familia.  The night manager went ABOVE and BEYOND to get us there on time.  It was much appreciated!!!!!  

Recommend this hotel enthusiastically.",5,2018,10,18
41,"The real luxury, never seen such a guest experience!","I am a regular traveller, and always like to choose a hotel for its guest experiences standands. I decided to go to Barcelona in a last minute basis, and was said this was the hot spot this season. To be honest I don´t like much to go to brand new hotels, as it is normally a bad choise since the new staff are still been trained and so on. But I must said I do not remember when it was the last time my expectations have been overcamed. And my experience at the Edition was one of a such. It is the new luxury, which the attention to every single word you say it is taken into their attention. It is a real case of sucesseful custumer services. Every one of those who I spoke within the staff of in the same level of training, the highets one.From the doorman, the front desk team, the conncierge team, the restaurant staff up to the managers I can not thing about a single thing to complain. In fact, surprising me is not a easy task, and they did, what an experience. In the name of Stephanie Wan, Lorena Gonzales, Javier, Sebastian, Rodrigo, Diana, Gresa and everyone else who hosted me, my deepest gratitude. Barcelona at the edition is a completely new experience, can not wait to go there again!",5,2018,10,18
41,Hip cool  yet warm hearted,"We had the pleasure to enjoy the rooftop bar: the view is fantastic but go there for other reasons! Tapas with a crossover Latin America meets Asia, cocktails made with great passion and a staff that really sees you. Seriously.. how can this place be within one of the world leading hotel chains..? So professional  to every detail! It is more of a privately owned hideaway for us who really enjoys when great is closer to fantastic.. but with sophistication and integrity⭐️
The restaurant in the ground floor seems to have an exiting menu but needs to work a bit on the ambiance.. a bit to moody..
But for being opened just a few weeks we know they will find their feeling as well!
",5,2018,10,15
41,"If you don’t think you like 5 star hotels, think again!","I don’t like the kind of luxury hotel where you are greeted with acres of marble flooring and holier-than-thou staff. The BARCELONA Edition is not that kind of place. It is small and beautifully designed. They do everything they can for every guest, and every guest feels they have a found a home and friends. Other reviews have praised the lovely rooms and the exciting rooftop bar, and I agree.  But you also have to try the ground floor restaurant! Not your usual hotel dining. It is a destination for locals out for an evening with friends, and a real treat for hotel residents.  The service is outstanding. The location is really wonderful - right next to a famous market, buzzing with colors and sights. And it is adjacent to 3 different charming walking neighborhoods of winding lanes, unique shops and little bars and restaurants.  A surprise around every corner. We loved staying at the Edition. ",5,2018,10,09
41,About the hotel terrace,This is one of the most beatiful terraces in Barcelona and the drinks are great. Cool music and great service. I had a gin tonic that was amazing. Its a 360 view terrace so you can swich sides. In one of them you will see the cathedral. Thanks. We had a great time!,5,2018,10,08
41,The best and friendliest staff,"We stayed for two nights and will be back again in two weeks. Good location close to the cruise port and convenient for sites. The hotel is fairly new. We have never stayed at any hotel where the staff was as welcoming and as friendly as here. Every request was met with an attitude of ""let's make it great for you."" Check in, security, bell service, bar staff, concierge -- all outstanding. The rooftop bar has great views, nice liquor selection, and outstanding service and light food (tapas like) selections. Try the shrimp, pulled pork, and empanadas - you will not be disappointed. Lots of flavor. The room was technologically modern. It came with US adapters and built in USB chargers. Very modern. Have I mentioned how great the staff was? Nothing negative to say. It could not have been better.",5,2018,10,04
41,Cool hotel with great staff,"This hotel and staff actually exceeded our lofty expectations as we're from the NYC area and have stayed at London and NYC locations before.  From the moment we walked through the doors, we were provided with ""white glove"" treatment.  From the charming young lady at the front desk to the rest of the staff (Sebastian and crew), all of our needs were met with great enthusiasm and perfection.  On a daily basis the staff worked with us to determine locations for great dining, touring, beaching, etc. activities.  Any of my gf's special accommodations were handled with a smile and attentiveness.

The hotel itself is nestled in a very convenient location and is totally chic. The lobby restaurant was great with fantastic service. Our room was roomy, sexy and comfortable. We absolutely loved the beautiful rooftop bar which was complete with lounging beds, pool and fantastic views of the city in a ""NYC cool"" laid back environment.  The icing on the cake was that after the rooftop closed, we discovered the dark, sexy Punch Room (omg).  The Punch Room gave you that after hour cool vibe where you end the night with a drink or two (or three lol). 

Overall, we highly recommend that anyone staying in Barcelona should book their stay at this fabulous hotel.  It's just perfect! 

Again, the Desilvas thanks the staff for their tremendous care!  Thanks! Merci! Gracias!",5,2018,10,04
41,"Beautiful ""Edition"" to Barcelona!","I would be doing a disservice to this hotel and staff to not highlight how unbelievably welcomed they made me and my fiancee feel over the 2 days we stayed there. Our stay at the hotel was not planned. We were heading home to NYC through Barcelona after 10 days in Ibiza when an issue with our plane right before take off occurred. Our flight was subsequently cancelled, when all hell ensued with the airline in the BCN airport. All we wanted to do was either be on our way home or get to a super comfortable hotel, regroup and relax. 

We needed a hotel for the night. Being an SPG Member, we previously stayed at the W Hotel and Arts Hotel in Barcelona and the hotel service in both was poor. And both hotels were in major need of a facelift. So we didn't want to settle. Knowing that the Edition opened a little over a month ago and having stayed at the Edition in Miami, we thought it was a great choice. 

The hotel is in a great location. Not knowing BCN intimately, it sure felt like a central location in city. Upon arriving, the valet / bell and the front desk & management team were there to immediately greet us. After letting the staff know of our situation, they were genuinely upset for us. All they cared about was wanting to ensure we were quick checked in quickly and if we needed any assistance with any of our travel issues. I can not thank the front desk staff as well as the front desk manager at the time for greeting us with a smile and calming our nerves. 

The hotel itself is awesome. It is beautiful, modern and new as would be expected with an Ian Schrager designed Edition Hotel. And even though it is a modern hotel, it sure fits in nicely in the old city. The rooms are super comfortable, the beds are extremely comfortable. All I can say is, we walked in to this hotel super stressed and upon entry, the design and feel alleviated pretty much all stress for both of us. 

The roof top is truly unique for BCN. Views are amazing. There is tiny relaxing pool. It is small, but perfect for the roof space. There are couches and beds for relaxing. It is an enjoyable space to chill and soak in the city. 

The following day our flight was cancelled again and immediately made our way back to the Edition. There wasn't a second of hesitation this was going to be where we stayed again. And once again, the front desk staff, management, and valet / bell team were there to greet us...this time with a glass of wine to ease the nerves. And because of travel troubles over the prior 24 hours, the front desk manager upgraded us to a higher floor with a room that was available with a better view. I wish I had all of their names because they all deserve recognition by hotel management, but I can't recall. They really made a horrible situation much much better. And the hotel itself was such a nice treat to end our vacation. 

We travel to Ibiza every summer and there is no question we will end each trip decompressing in BCN at the Edition before heading back to NYC.",5,2018,09,29
41,Amazing terrace,"The ambience and the view are both spectacular, the service is excelent, drinks are fine but unfortunately the food was not that great. However the whole experience was delightful, I would definately go back and give the food another try.",4,2018,09,26
41,Sleek design with great personal touch!,"The Edition in Barcelona definitely lives up to its name and reputation. My fiancee and I recently stayed there for two nights and absolutely loved it. From the moment you arrive, your warmly greeted into this picturesque yet comforting hotel. The entire team at Edition makes you feel right at home with that extra special touch of personalized class. 

The room and hotel facilities were a pleasant comfort and throughout our stay we were warmly welcomed by one of the associates at the front desk named Gabriel. Gabriel made our stay that extra special each and everyday with his bright smile and accommodating personality. Gabriel took time out of his day to show us around the property and even arranged special arrangements for us at the rooftop bar. 

The bar is located on the hotel rooftop and offers stunning views of the city and we were very happy to enjoy this at the end of each night of our stay. 

We very much are looking forward to staying at this hotel again in the near future and will be trying the new Edition in Shanghai as introduced by Gabriel.",5,2018,09,26
41,Extremely elegant room,"Unique room, in terms of the design. All in all, very friendly staff, 10/10 hotel. I stayed here with my boyfriend, and we had everything we needed. The punch room is very elegant and the drinks there are great.",5,2018,09,25
41,No words...,My family and I stayed at the Edition in August and it was the highlight of our trip. The customer service and each employee were exceptional. The rooftop is stunning and a must while staying at the hotel. This will be the number 1# hotel in Barcelona by the end of this year!!! I can't wait to go back....,5,2018,09,24
41,European family vacation,"This hotel was only one month old at the time of our visit.  You are greeted by friendly English-speaking staff who never stop being accommodating and creating a warm environment.  The rooms are beautiful with wood floors, exceptionally clean and great service provided by staff.  The restaurant in the hotel, Bar Veraz, offers great drinks and amazing food.  The chefs are renowned and the food prep, presentation, choices and taste are excellent. There's a punch room that offers tastes of a variety of punches and other drinks.  The roof top bar is also great with its views of the city. By Sept 18, there will be a lower level Cabaret room that will offer nightly entertainment and a live atmosphere.  Special recognition to the concierge and his staff, Rodrigo, our bellman Paola and the entire dining staff.",5,2018,09,17
41,One of the best rooftops in Barcelona!,"I haven't stayed at the hotel, but just went to the rooftop and the punch room. The roof has a perfect view and food is really tasty. The service is impeccable. The people working there are so nice, especially Guilherme, such a lovely person!
Highly recommended!",5,2018,09,15
41,Fantástico ,All the staff members were very professional and attentive especially the doormen the were very good giving directions and suggestions. The small rooftop pool is a plus and the drinks a little pricey but good. We will definitely go back the next time we go to Barcelona. The gym was great too.,5,2018,09,15
41,So so good,"I’m not prone to pretending to be a travel writer but I do want to comment on this hotel. From the hugely friendly welcome to being roomed by front of house to the room itself absolutely faultless. 

The roof top bar is simple but stunning with well trained staff who actually remember what you ordered in case you can’t the next day. The pool, whilst not Olympic size, is lovely and suited to the space. 

Food again simple but elegant and full of flavour. Take note other hotels keep it simple keep it friendly get it right and the reviews will show. 10 our 10. ",5,2018,09,13
41,Another Amazing Stay - LOVE this Brand!,"London - NYC - Miami and now Barcelona.  We love this brand and the entire Edition experience.  My wife and I stayed at the Barcelona location last week and were truly impressed with the level of service and attention to detail.  We would like to specifically recognize Stephanie Wan - Ana Coles - Alejandra - Emilio and the front door guy . . .sorry we forgot your name!  Thanks for a great stay - we will be back!!
You guys ROCK :)",5,2018,09,12
41,Amazing service,Fantastic stay in this new hotel. Amazing hotel and staff. Theybwerw so helpful and pleasant Will do it again anytime. The lovation is pedrfect distance from everything and the roof bar is a pleasure to cone back to after a day of adventure.,5,2018,09,03
41,My kids told me they were surprised I booked such a cool hotel,"We were traveling with our 20's something single kids who loved this hotel from the speak-easy room to the amazing terrace.  The only disappointment was the pool - it is really more of a water feature for the terrace bar. Our daughter stepped off the elevator at the terrace the first evening planning to swim, dressed in her vacation flip flops and tankini, to quickly realize she was comically out of place with the DJ and evening-attired clientele.  Also, we had talked to the main Marriott reservation line about using a rollaway for our last night there, only to find later our room was too small to have one fit.  That aside, we enjoyed our stay. Every employee was just delightful and seemed excited to be helping with the grand kick-off of this new property.  Great location across from the cathedral -would totally stay there again!",5,2018,09,03
41,Fantastic Stay! Amazing new 5* Hotel in Barcelona,"We had a wonderful stay at the Edition Hotel as part of our honeymoon trip to Spain and I cannot recommend this hotel enough! 

When we have previously stayed in a hotel during its soft opening, all the staff are a little rusty and the amenities aren’t fully open – however this was not the case at the Edition! All the staff were fantastic, so professional, welcoming and accommodating. 

The hotel itself is beautifully designed and of a really high quality finish. The bed is out of this world! Everything about the hotel from the room desks, the bathroom robes, staircases, toilets, the lifts etc really is true 5* luxury. 

For us breakfast was an absolute highlight! All the produce was sourced from the market next door so was incredibly fresh. The breakfast menu is modern and in keeping with the hotel. The granola / yoghurt is amazing. It was also a really nice touch that they hotel prepared us breakfast to take away on our last morning as we were leaving before breakfast started. 

We had lunch and drinks at the rooftop, nibbles and (more) drinks in the punch room and one night we ordered some room service - all were excellent. 

This is a must visit hotel! Clearly it is a much needed addition to the hotel style in Barcelona as it is very different to what else is available in the 5* market. 

Thanks for a great stay!",5,2018,08,28
41,Best terrace in Barcelona,Been there a couple times already and it definetly has one of the best views of any hotel in Barcelona. It also has a salt water pool and unparalleled service. Everyone is very kind and caring. Will go there as much as I can this summer!,5,2018,08,24
41,A Marvellous Short Stay! ,"We opted to stay in the newly opened EDITION hotel, even though our initial plan was to stay in Paseo De Gràcia as it’s an area we like more. However I can happily say that we made the best choice! 
This new hotel is a delight! It’s small and cosy, everything in the hotel reflects high quality. But what truly made our stay so pleasant, was their amazing service. The entire team, from the amazing bell boy Martine, to the reception team, their knowledgable concierge Rodrigo etc.. were all very friendly, very attentive to any comment we had in order to ensure that our stay was as comfortable as can be. Honestly, We can gladly compare this sort of attention  and personal service to that of the Four Seasons, if not better! 
The food at the bar/ terrace is Peruvian fusion and was something both my husband and our two children truly
Enjoyed. Their breakfast  menu is a la carte and the truffle omelette is definitely the best I’ve ever had! All the food we had tasted like high end/ fine dining quality. 
They have a beautiful pool table at the punch Room! 
The area is very lively and has so much character, during the day it was a lot of fun to walk around in. The only downfall was that at night, it felt a little less pleasant as being in Paseo De Gràcia. 
I wish the management and the entire team at this new hotel the best of luck and would highly recommend it. ",5,2018,08,21
41,AWESOME !! ,"Yes the location was amazing - yes the hotel is new but more than anything else , the team there are AMAZING !! 

The concierge team especially Mr Rodrigo went out of his way to explain the area and crossed checked on his own if the places were open (like the weekend markets etc. )

We stayed for 5 nights and at all touch points , the attention to detail was amazing !! Whether it was the room service lady who kept a tray of English Breakfast Tea and fresh milk every night or the housekeeping team who arranged all our randomly paced small things neatly arranged . 

Thank you Edition Barcelona Team !! ",5,2018,08,18
41,Nice top roof,"Such a nice top roof! We went a few days ago to check out this top roof and we loved it, very good service from our server Alan the mustache guy, thank you very much! Specially the causa squid wich he wisely recommended.",5,2018,08,14
41,Amazing Experience,"I have to say i was a bit skeptical about  booking this hotel as it had only just opened a week before we arrived. I was expecting to experience some ""teething"" problems within the hotel but i was totally wrong! The staff and service was fantastic. Everyone was so lovely and helpful. The food at the pool was incredible and the rooms were amazing!  Location is also perfect. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,08,14
41,Very Nice New Hotel!,"Stayed at the Barcelona Edition for 5 nights.  The hotel is brand new and this is an obvious bonus!  The hotel lobby is attractively decorated in contemporary woods.  Check in was fast and flawless.  The staff is very attentive and eager to be of assistance.

The rooms are smaller than I expected.  I have never been to Barcelona and thus have no idea what other hotel rooms are like.  Despite the size, the bed is comfortable.  The bathroom is also small but nice.

WIFI is fast and excellent.  For me, wifi is a deal breaker!

There is a restaurant next door which offers organic foods and is excellent.  I also strongly suggest you visit Hoffman Patisserie - the best croissants in the world.

I would definitely stay here again.  I do think price is a bit high given the size of the rooms and the amenities offered, but again, I have no comparative hotel stays.",5,2018,08,09
41,Simply amazing!,"Hotel is perfectly situated in heart of the city, 10 min walk to marina. It is unique/interesting with design and,what's more important, filled with fantastic, friendly personnel. The main restaurant with food served all day is to die for. However, roof top bar is a real gem with an amazing view over the city and even more amazing drinks! Surely, this is new destination place in Barcelona! Will hopefully be back soon!",5,2018,08,07
41,Gastronomic experience,"We went for drinks on the rooftop first, the view is amaZing, with great cocktails.
Then we had dinner downsairs and there you get a massive experience.
The food is just incredible!! Amazing menu, amaZing drinks!! Try everything and you wont be disapointed.
Even the second chef came to say hi at the end and we had a proper chat!
Thanks to the pr alejandra and the manager caterina for hosting us and joining us at the table. 
The service is awsome!! We really had a good time! ",5,2018,08,06
41,The best EDITION to BCN ,"I’m a local resident and been to The Edition a number of times since it opened.  Best cocktails, punch and food in an amazing setting .... but the reason or this review is to compliment the staff. From the doorman to the general manager (whom I met on my last visit) the team could not be better. Keep up the good work!",5,2018,08,05
41,Excellent!,"Visiting the Hotel just 6 days after the opening, I was prepared to encounter some challenges but to my surprise everything was just perfect. 

I just stayed one night but decided to try all the venues of the Hotel. After checking in with Javi, who to my surprise already knew my name when I came to the reception, I moved to the bar in the lobby for a coffee where I was served by an Italian barman, whose name I unfortunately forgot. Everything great until now. So I went up to the room where I found some nice welcome amenities (cookies designed as Gaudí tiles). Room and bathroom just perfect! Loved the big shower. 

Then I went up to the roof. A superb terrace overlooking Barcelona. I was served by Sara in a super nice and professional manner (sorry to move tables several times but the sun was just so hot). Later on, Fran a guy from Argentina took over from Sara. The service was just great with a super personal touch. Thanks as well to Matilda, the manager upstairs who took care of us and made sure everything was going well. 

Later that evening we decided to go down to have dinner in the Restaurant. The food was great! Loved the Catalan Chicken! Service by Aurore and another lady (probably from Uruguay, judging the accent) simply perfect. 

Looking forward to coming back soon! And I hope they will keep up the excellent work!

",5,2018,08,01
41,Hidden gem! ,"Fantastic interior, amazing drinks and lovely service. Will be visiting this place the whole summer! Amazing view over the city. Only downside is the size of the pool. A bit too small but everything else is top notch. ",5,2018,08,01
41,Amazing cocktails,"We visited 2 days after they opened. Place is super cool, great atmosphere ,music & cocktails are just delicious. Service as well is really high standard .
Def the best hotel bar in Barcelona .
Ps: they have a pool table in the bar",5,2018,08,01
41,Excellent in every way service accommodation food ambiance and position,"This was very rare weekend in barcelona to celebrate my boyfriend birthday 💥💥our stay in edition hotel entirely met our expectations. Their attention to all details of hospitality and comfort is meticulous. Rooftop bar peace and quiet atmosphere, very comfot zone . From the moment we arrive until the moment we leave the service is phenomenal:) staff very friendly, amazing selection of nice crispy -sweet- very sharp cocktails 🍸, the starters are delicious 😋 customers service was ar a high level. Marcos was a sweetheart. ",5,2018,07,31
41,"New hotel, service not cool.","Went to the hotel since it is new and wanted to have a drink and a bite at their terrace. Hotel structure is amazing, very tasteful, however there is a lot of improving to do service wise. They mixed up my drink order, because they didnt had the bottle and they thought i wouldnt notice. When I sent the drink back they all started arguing with each other and took forever to bring the new drink. This sparkling rose was so warm that it was very hard and unpleasant to drink. The whole situation was so uncomfortable that I decided to finish my snack and leave. I really hope they get better since the hotel is very nice.",3,2018,07,28
41,Schleter service for young guests,"A fiasco. 
Arrived directly get a place at the same time as other guests. The other guests were immediately given a drinks menu. But it seems sin inside younger guests no matter than 10 min later still none has come.",1,2024,09,02
41,Amazing view,"It is an amazing place of view, service and food 
A 100/100 place! Super friendly and attentive service! The staff always try to be very comfortable 
One of the 360 views in the heart of Barcelona! 
We went to dinner and there were several very rich options to eat!",5,2024,08,17
41,Absolute disappointment,"We went to my friends for drinks on the rooftop and the truth that we had been treated terrible. We ordered the round (two drinks and a coke for 37€) and they were bothering us all the time (they had come saying that we can't stay at that table etc ) that we can't sit at the table either on one side or the other, because it's for hotel guests. I find all this ridiculous and disrespectful. So they let people up if Shopping for a gin and tonic and they won't let you sit down. Finally, I don't recommend going. Fatal",1,2024,08,17
41,Unforgettable Stay,"My recent stay at Edition Barcelona was simply exceptional. From the moment I arrived until my departure, every detail was attended to with professionalism and warmth.

What really stood out was the attention to the guest. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly, attentive and always willing to help. Sergi checked us in and stayed with us until we left for dinner to make sure we had everything we needed.

They gave us a beautiful room with views of the market, one of the most unique views of Barcelona, worth seeing and hardly visible except from the Edition itself. The room was spotless. Michael, along with Joel Almeyda and Francesc Martín, prepared a surprise for us that made us very excited. They left us a frame with our photos and some white chocolate roses that were delicious.

When we returned from dinner we went to the ""Punch room"", an ideal room to have a cocktail and learn to play pool in my case, it is a very cozy place where you meet people who are also enjoying their vacations. The guys at the bar were very friendly and we really felt at home.

We had breakfast at Veraz, Camila Cavilla attended us. Apart from the fact that the breakfast was delicious, his smile and his affection towards the client is highly notable, he gave us great advice on how to choose from the immense variety of food they have for breakfast. The quality of the ingredients and presentation were of a high level. It is worth mentioning that it is one of the few places where they have DO Guijuelo ham, which made me especially excited since it is not easy to find in Barcelona, much less in a hotel breakfast, no matter how luxurious it may be and because it brings back memories of my family origins. Besides, it is the best ham in the world :)

You can't stay without having a drink on the roof top, it is the best in Barcelona without a doubt. Furthermore, the culinary variety is exceptional. Nelson Lorenz and his team assisted us, they found us the best spot to enjoy dream views.

It is possible that I left someone out without mentioning it, but I want to emphasize that the added value that this place has are the people who work there. From the entrance to the hotel director Brunella Zinato. Each and every one of them took care of us and made us feel at home. I did not ask the name of two women who were in charge of cleaning the rooms. I have traveled a lot around the world and in no hotel has a woman in charge of cleaning asked me about my stay and stopped her busy day to show interest in us. I remember that she was a middle-aged blonde woman if I remember correctly. We met her in the hallway and when we got into the elevator we looked at each other and said, this is 10-star service. I repeat, we feel so cared for that we are already dreaming of returning.

We will return without a doubt and we will recommend it to all of our people. You cannot miss this jewel of Barcelona.

Thank you!!!!!",5,2024,02,25
41,Three fantastic days,"I stayed at the Oriente Atiran hotel, on the Rambla, exceptional for its location, welcome, breakfast and cleanliness. I recommend booking the entrances (Sagrada, Casa Batllo etc. etc.) be careful with your wallet as many people attract pickpockets.",4,2023,10,08
41,Shameful,"Worst experience ever. They told us that we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table on the rooftop, making us spend a hundred euros for 4 drinks while we waited, after more than an hour they told us that they would only have it inside and that we would have to wait longer to have it outside, we decided to wait only to be told that they wouldn't have it either inside or outside. In addition to the unacceptable anti-professionalism, there is also rudeness and arrogance. Don't go there, not only because they will steal your money, but even more importantly they will steal your time, which is the most important thing.",1,2023,08,14
41,Fantastisches Stadthotel - im Herzen der Stadt mit tollem Rooftop,"Als Fans der EDITION Hotelkette wurden wir auch in Barcelona nicht enttäuscht. Man spürt schon beim Check-In, dass der Service und die Freundlichkeit auf einem anderen Level sind als in anderen Luxushotels. 

Wir waren zwar nur eine Nacht vor Ort, aber es hat sich mal wieder gelohnt, und wir kommen bestimmt wieder. Fantastisch war auch der Rooftop-Pool, den man um die Nachmittagszeit fast alleine für sich hatte (incl. Liegen).",5,2023,06,06
41,Toller Aufenthalt- freundliches Service ,"Wir hatten ein paar tolle Tage in Barcelona. Die Ankunft und der gesamte Aufenthalt waren super, sehr freundliche Mitarbeiter, alle sehr bemüht. Coole Rooftop Bar, sehr leckeres Frühstück. Zimmer auch gemütlich und praktisch! Perfektes Stadthotel! ",5,2023,04,19
41,Brunch genial ,"Hicimos el brunch por 35 euros .Cava Juve Camps ilimitado ( hasta las 16 horas ) ,comida muy buena y atención exquisita por parte de Nerea y en la terraza por Carolina y David .gracias volveremos estuvimos muy agusto .",5,2022,11,28
41,Miserables,"Anoche tuvimos un evento de empresa en el citado hotel. El primer problema fue que pactamos un horario en la terraza y como la compartíamos con otro grupo, a última hora nos cambiaron el horario restringiéndolo de lo que habíamos pactado. Aunque luego, el otro grupo canceló por covid y ahí estuvieron super amables para que nos quedáramos y consumiéramos. Segundo, el menú que costó 50€ persona era una misería y no exagero, la calidad era buena pero super escaso y las porciones ridículas. Yo comí 4 minitapas y un postre. Pasamos bastante hambre. El tema bebidas estaba correcto y el personal que nos atendía en terraza, super amables. El tercer problema era que al estar en la terraza y con el calor de estos días de ola de calor, estábamos en una sala con unas mamparas de vidrio, abiertas por uno de los costados, sin aire acondicionado, y se generaba un calor terrible como si estuviéramos en un invernadero. Pedimos ventiladores y nos dijeron que no tenían, en un hotel!!! no tenían ni un mísero ventilador. Finalmente logramos que nos abrieran las puertas acristaladas para que corriera un poco de aire, o sea que el tema climatización, nulo. Esta fue nuestra experiencia. Al final tratando así a los clientes, ellos pierden porque nosotros desde luego no volveremos y tampoco lo vamos a recomendar a nadie. Resumen, unos peseteros miserables!! Lo único maravilloso eran las vistas a la ciudad..",1,2022,07,16
41,Terribile esperienza,"Quando si paga 400 euro a notte ci si aspetta di non dover attendere un'ora e mezza per fare il check-in visto che c'è una sola persona che deve servire 20 Clienti... ci si aspetta anche che l'acqua calda funzioni e che venga qualcuno a sistemarla quando fai una segnalazione... Ci si aspetta che la chiave elettronica funzioni senza che si smagnetizzi di continuo... Ci si aspetta che le persone che hanno impegni di lavoro possano fare colazione almeno alle 7 e non alle 7.30 considerato anche il fatto che non é a buffet ma alla carta... Tempi infiniti per qualsiasi cosa, il peggior Albergo Mariott in cui sia mai stato... Bye Bye ",1,2022,05,06

41,Bar Veraz una carta de Coctelería excelente,"Nos comentaron que este bar perteneciente al hotel The Barcelona Edition tenía una carta diferente que merecía la pena probar.
Al entrar en el lugar es un sitio espacioso, muy agradable con un ambiente ideal para relajarse a tomar algo o cenar.
Nuestro  caso elegímos tomar una copa.  Pedímos la carta y al ver que estábamos indecisos nos ayudo Adrián. La verdad que el trato ,además del resto de los compañeros ,fue increíble porque nos fue encaminando por nuestros gustos y preferencias hasta dar con ello.
Elegímos un cocktail y un smoothie que tras una maravillosa explicación, al probarlo,  fue un sabor fuera de lo común!
En conclusión un lugar increíble para disfrutar de una copa o una cena, con un trato excelente.
Dar la enhorabuena a Adrián,  una persona que ama su trabajo, transmitiendo esa pasión al cliente y haciendo que se sienta como en casa.",5,2019,10,13

41,Más de lo que uno se imagina (:,"Estuve el mes Julio tomando algo con unos amigos. En realidad elegimos The Roof por el simple hecho de que nos caía de camino. La bienvenida del personal de recepción fue cálida y alegre. 

Nos subimos al The Roof, sonrisas por todos los lados, limpieza y buen servicio son los conceptos que caracterizan este lugar. 

Decidimos tomar cóctel de entre unos 10 más o menos que ofrece la carta. El secret sunset fue la recomendación de José, un chico alegre y educado. Muchas gracias Jose por la recomendación. 

Definitavemente volveremos!!! <3",5,2019,08,20

L'hotel e' di lusso, veramente bello.
Siamo stati accolta alla reception da personale gentilissimo e professionale che ci ha spiegato come arriva alla terraza.
Il rooftop molto bello, con lettoni , in quanto vi e' anche la piscina e/o tavolini, veramente un ambiente elegante e romantico, e molto cosmopolita.
Vista meravigliosa su Barca e lo skyline. 
Cocktail ottimi a prezzi adeguati all' ambiente.

41,Gentili ma Furbetti,"Bell'hotel di tendenza, anche elegante, ma non all'altezza dei 5 stelle di tradizione!
Purtroppo abbiamo prenotate una Luxury per avere un poco di spazio in più di una Guest o Delux. Purtroppo ci è stata affibbiata una camera di livello inferiore.
Per loro sfortuna la planimetria affissa alla porta della camera era molto dettagliata e si evinceva facilmente che era la camera più piccola del piano in cui eravamo. Peccato che tutti i piani erano strutturati alla stessa maniera, quindi, o erano tutte Luxury e l'hotel aveva cancellato sia le Guest che le Delux o era la basica. La seconda versione è quella giusta.
Abbiamo chiesto il cambio con diversa vista, per avere una maggiore dimensione, ma, prima ci hanno assicurato che lo avrebbero fatto nella giornata seguente,  aspettando il nostro ritorno per verificare che la camera ci piacesse...poi al momento del cambio, dispiaciuti, ci hanno detto che l'hotel era full. (ci crediamo?).
Concierge non all'altezza di clientela esigente. 
Gentili ed efficienti nel risolvere un problema con il nostro materasso.
Ottima colazione.
Però la furbizia lasciamola ad altri Hotel di categorie inferiori !",2,2019,06,26
41,Servicio pésimo,"Vistas maravillosas desde la terraza , atencion pesima en un hotel barcelonino donde los camareros no hablan catalan ni castellano . Servicio  lentísimo y poco eficiente.

Ha sido una gran experiencia. Muy recomendable.",5,2018,11,29
41,Para ir a ver las vistas,"Fuimos al rooftop (terraza) a tomar un café y unos postres. La carta de postres nos decepcionó mucho, tienen postres demasiado elaborados y caros, los probamos y no valen para nada el precio que tienen. En el Edition de Londres, por ejemplo, los postres son mucho más variados y hay básicos que no deberían faltar en un hotel, y menos en un Marriott. 
Eso sí, es un espacio con buena decoración y goza de muy buenas vistas.",3,2018,11,16

La atención del personal es excelente, son muy atentos, simpáticos y te ayudan en cualquier momento, en especial Elisabet, la chica que nos atendió.

41,UN ENCANTO DE TERRAZA,"Fuimos a visitar la Terraza, las vistas de la ciudad son encantadoras.  En un lado de la terraza , ( lado montaña) mesas y una barra de bar, al otro lado ( lado mar) camas balinesas. Decoración romántica y mediterránea.   
La Piscina se encuentra tras  subir. Unos pocos escalones.
Pedimos una botella de vino, que disfrutamos  viendo la puesta de sol. Dado que es una terraza no pueden tener copas de cristal y los vasos y copas de cava son realmente muy parecidos al cristal, siendo de plástico. La pena fué que no tienen copas de vino, y beber un vino en vaso no es una buena opción, espero en breve puedan encontrar unas copas de vino de plástico como tienen las de cava para poder disfrutar 100%. Ag! I que me avisen cuando las tengan!!
El personal muy atento ,Todos en general.Mencion especial a Lena. 
Seguramente volveré! Aunque no tomaré vino sin copa! Hotel Muy bien localizado, en el puro centro y con una elegancia refinada.

Hacia dos años que no veníamos y invitados por amigos nos alojamos en Edition para disfrutar de un sitio muy agradable.Un elogio para Guillermo,un  chico que nos deleitó con sus formas en el Roof que no deja pasar detalles,bajo la mirada gentil de Mathilda y la permanente  ayuda de Ana.luego bajamos al Punch y con Chongui e Ivan pasamos un  tiempo de flores con la producción de su ponche Edition lleno de aromas.Hasta la próxima y sin dudarlo .",5,2018,08,23
41,Espectacular terraza y servicio en el rooftop,"No conocimos el hotel hasta la semana pasada que subimos a la terraza a tomar algo y no hay duda de que es una de las mejores terrazas de barcelona, nos atendió Eli, la chica con el pelo más largo que hemos visto nunca!! Nos trató genial y dió un servicio muy atento y amigable. Tomamos unas claras de yuzu y nos recomendó acompañarlas con unas yucas, buenísimo todo. Las vistas increíbles, y la música muy chill. Una experiencia que desde luego vamos a volver a repetir!!",5,2018,08,20
41,Rofftop con impresionantes vistas de Barcelona,"Un servicio excelente, los trabajadores son muy profesionales pero a su vez amigables y te harán sentir muy a gusto. Pasar un rato con amigos o en pareja con unas vistas espectaculares de Barcelona tomando un vino y comiendo las yuquitas fritas :) muy recomendado!",5,2018,08,16
41,Excelente,"Hemos ido a cenar y a tomar un daikiri y tanto la cena como el coctel han sido excelentes. El trato es exquisito, con mucho interès en que estemos a gusto. Nos han enseñado la terraza, que es espectacular, con unas vistas extraordinarias. Recomendable 100%.",5,2018,08,13
41,Extraordinario,"Es un muy buen referente para Barcelona. Hemos cenado en el comedor de la entrada y nos han servido unos platillos para compartir muy originales y bien presentados y elaborados. El servicio muy atento y profesional.

 Hemos también visitado la terraza y hay que considerarla una de las mejores de la ciudad con vistas espectaculares. El bar de la primera planta nos pareció insuperable. Es un privilegio disponer de un establecimiento de este nivel en Barcelona

No nos alojamos en el Hotel, pues vivimos en Barcelona pero suponemos que las habitaciones estarán al mismo nivel de calidad",5,2018,08,07
41,TERRAZA CHILL OUT,"Bueno por donde comenzamos?
Bienvenida bastante atentos, nos indicaron la ruta por la que subir a la “rooftop”, el ascensor se dotaba de un estilo bastante interesante por la poca luz y su diseño, el “hall” se deja querer con un agrado llamativo, una vez arribaarriba pedimos un zumo y un cocktail, los camareros bastante atentos, dejan una imagen bastante amigable con camisas de rayas y bermuda negra! Quizas la ‘piscina’ se les quedase pequeña pero todo muy bonito!
Nos atendio cordialmente un chico que se llamaba Alan, nos explico que los reposa vasos estaban echos de plastico reciclado y que de recogían en la playa, nos ofrecio quedarnoslo!! Un grato recuerdo y un buen servicio el de esa tarde en pareja, lo felicitó por el trato.",4,2018,08,07
41,Stylish without all the design chichi,"Beim neuen Edition in Barcelona hat Ian Schräger mit seinem Team aus regionalen Design-Assistenten ganze Arbeit geleistet. Das Hotel präsentiert sich modern, ohne (wie das grauslige  W Hotel) Design Trends hinterherzuhecheln. Die Bar bietet famose Cocktails. Der Rooftop bedarf noch ein wenig mehr Schatten, es war sehr heiss da oben. Der Pool ist recht klein, aber für eine schnelle Erfrischung genau richtig. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und schnell dabei, die Wünsche des Gastes zu erfüllen. Es machen sukzessive auch noch neue Faciltiies des Hotels auf bis September, so wurde uns erzählt. So auch ein Live Show Venus, auf den wir schon gespannt sind. Das Barcelona EDITION - zweifelsfrei eines der heissesten Hotel Openings 2018 in Barcelona!",5,2018,08,04
41,Neueröffnung an einen sehr zentralen Standort,"Ein neues Hotel in Barcelona muss schon etwas Besonderes bieten, wenn es erfolgreich sein will. Wir waren in der Eröffnungswoche dort. Zunächst einmal: die Lage ist super. Gleich nebenan der Mercat Santa Catarina und die Kathedrale. Super Blick auf das Born Viertel. Dachterrasse mit kleinem Pool, Bar und Loungearea. Das Essen ist gut, die Portionen zum Teilen ok. Preis im oberen Segment. Noch sind alle im Neueröffnungsmodus, sehr bemüht und aufmerksam. Wenn sie das im Normalbetrieb etwas anpassen aber im Wesentlichen beibehalten, wird das ein Erfolg.  ",5,2018,08,02
41,Un must en barcelona,"De un no saber que hacer un miércoles noche, a encontrar un must en Barcelona. Servicio elegante pero cercano, cocina elaborada y sabrosa, y un espacio atemporal detrás de una puerta que parece secreta donde cada cóctel clásico o punch te deja sin palabras.",5,2018,08,01
41,Súper cocktails,"Una barra en el rooftop súper fresca y con muy buen ambiente. Pedimos cocktails fuera de carta con nikka y salimos súper contentos con Alejo y Marcos!
Para repetir una y otra vez! Además de las vistas y de la piscina que invita a volver.",5,2018,08,01
