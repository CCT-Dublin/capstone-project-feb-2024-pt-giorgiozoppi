The title says it all, but note a stay at Hotel is as excellent for business as it is for a slow pace, beautiful, restful and pampered leisure experience.  Though there is something special about the facilities, it is the team/staff that rise about it all.  They are exceptionally professional, courteous and naturally personal, attend  to your needs and interests before you think about it, and insure you are having an experience beyond your expectations.  So to make sure it's not setting your expectations so high they can't meet them, they are better than most and they are real in their personal encounters.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2024,10,14

218,Wedding venue of dreams!,"We got married in Killashee in September 2024, I cannot compliment the staff here enough. We had the most special day made possible by the extremely attentive staff from the front reception down to the banquetting team everyone was fantastic. The attention to every detail we wanted for our big day was excellent. Also a special mention The grounds keepers who maintain the beautiful grounds and gardens which  made a beautiful setting for our photos. The bridal suite was lovely and had all the amenities needed.

218,Friendly Hotel,"The food was very good, the building is great (much bigger than I thought). The Hydrotherapy area was very relaxing and enjoyable. The staff are very friendly. I great place for a good sleep. The attention to detail and the services let it down. ",3,2024,09,29

218,Oak and Anvil Bartender,"Fabulous hotel, love the aesthetics.
Bar was busy and vibrant and there was a great atmosphere. Food was a tiny bit slow but staff were apologetic and the wait was worth it! The bartender Naoise was helpful and friendly and improved the experience greatly. The hotel is lucky to have staff like him!",4,2024,09,28
218,Guests Be Cautious: Lost Items and Unhelpful Staff,"I have contacted the hotel numerous times by telephone and email, and never have I received a reply after being promised a call back on several occasions.

I left my iPad at the breakfast table and didn't realise this until after I got home. When I checked the tracker on the iPad, I could accurately see it was close to the reception area at the hotel. So I rang reception and asked if an iPad had been handed in. Without hesitation, I was told, ""No sir, nothing was handed in,"" without even attempting to look. I asked if he was sure, and as I did this, I made the iPad ring, which I could immediately hear in the background. I had to explain to him that was my iPad ringing; eventually, he admitted, ""Yes, it's here."" I thought, great—but before I could say anything else, he hung up on me. He was clearly lying and panicked when found out.

I rang reception two more times. The same person answered, and when I mentioned the iPad, they hung up on both occasions.

If I didn't have a tracker on the iPad and was lied to like this, I'm sure it would have gone into the unclaimed items for a member of staff to claim.

I did get to talk to a nice person who took my details and assured me that a manager would call me back, but nobody ever did.

After sending numerous emails, the next day I received a brief email saying they had my iPad and to collect it.

I replied, trying to make arrangements where I would pay for delivery, but again they never replied.

I decided to make the two-and-a-half-hour round trip to collect it before it was lost again.

During my stay, a plate glass window on the second floor was broken, shattering glass into the garden below, which missed me by about a metre. Again, no management was there to organise or explain anything. Eventually, a staff member cordoned off the area, but there was still glass hanging from the window. I have pictures.

On arrival, I had changed my room rate, which wasn't communicated to the reception staff, and then was accused of it not being changed until I provided email proof—which I had—and then was told I never replied (which wasn't required), but I had.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the hotel's management. Their lack of communication, unprofessional behaviour, and failure to address serious issues during my stay left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a guest. I hope they take these concerns seriously and make the necessary improvements.",1,2024,09,27
218,Mother daughter trip,"Wonderful place and amazing views and staff. Location was close to the bus, 15 to the train and 5 to the town. Great location. ",5,2024,09,24
218,Beautiful hotel.,"Beautiful hotel and grounds. The rooms were spacious, beautifully decorated, and very clean. However, the room keys were quite frustrating — we were given three, and none of them worked properly as they seemed very sensitive. We were there for a wedding, and while the overall experience was lovely, the food service was quite slow, and the music during dinner was much too loud.",4,2024,09,23
218,Fabulous Hotel with stunning Gardens & beautiful Spa & Leisure Centre,"Absolutely beautiful hotel overall. The bedroom and bathroom were very modern and extremely clean, spacious, comfortable and quiet, and well equipped with all the accessories you'd need during your stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Food in the Pippin Tree restaurant was beautifully presented and tasted exquisite. There was a wide variety of food available for breakfast and it was well organised, and service was excellent. The hotel gardens were meticulously manicured, and beautiful to walk around. The Spa and Leisure Centre were really nice, and the Spa treatments were very enjoyable and relaxing.",5,2024,09,23
218,Great exterior and nice location,Nice building and a nice location with a great gym. The food was below par. The room was clean with a good bed,2,2024,09,20
218,A stunning hotel,"A beautiful setting and a stunning hotel. I wished I had stayed longer so we could have gone to the spa. However, the room was too hot and there was no ac. There were no dressing gowns in the room and no iron although there was an ironing board. There were nice touches such as the hotel’s own chocolate and water. The service at dinner was very slow. I ordered a glass of wine and found two ants floating in it. But the food was very good and the hotel remembered my husband’s birthday and presented him with a plate of deserts. If they addressed the key issues it would lead to an amazing stay. ",4,2024,09,19

218,Enchanting & beautiful hotel,"I love staying at the Killashee. It has a lot to do for the kids and a kids indoor playroom if the weather is bad. The leisure center is wonderful. I love the decor and the grounds of this hotel. they had recently starting putting some air freshner/perfume scents into the air throughout the entire hotel and it is sooo strong and overwhelming and makes me sneeze. I wish they would stop that, as it is unhealthy to breathe in chemicals. ",4,2024,09,12
218,Room bad,I stayed in this hotel the 7th of September the pool was fantastic and food was ok but the room was not  we where ate alive by insects flying around the room bites everywhere we seen some coming out of the fire alarm so we sprayed deodorant to try kill them which set of the alarm I called reception to tell them and security arrived we went down  to reception at 3am  and asked  them had they any spray to  get rid  of what was in the room we where told no  very rude staff that dealt with us  eventually we where moved to another room and we found a dead fly on the bed never again  shocking for a four star hotel room 109 needs to be fumigated,2,2024,09,12

218,Little gem,"Had a little getaway break in this fantastic hotel. Stayed in room 146 pure luxury. Staff extremely friendly and go above and beyond. Ate in both restaurants and the food was delicious. Staff in Oak are very helpful and have great knowledge of  menu and wines. After dinner, had cocktails in the Oak&anvil which were made by Chris which were outstanding. Great friendly banter which made us stay longer for a nightcap. Definitely return.",5,2024,08,31
218,Worth the visit,"Recently passed by here with friends for a bite to eat as we had heard good things. I couldn’t fault anything about Killashee, from the food to the grounds to the staff. We dined in the Oak & Anvil, Claire greeted us and Zara was our server. Both very friendly. Food was delicious, we ordered 3 steak sambos. Bar service was quick which was ideal as we had to be somewhere afterwards. Will definitely be back again soon 10/10",5,2024,08,31
218,Great stay in the Killashee Hotel,I recently stayed in the Killashee Hotel and it was excellent. I had lunch in the Oak which was great and the drinks and service in Larkspur was excellent. The live music was fab and the rooms and their decor was very nice. We will be back again..,5,2024,08,31

218,Nice but a few changes would make this feel like a 4* .,Rooms/bathrooms could be cleaner   - breakfast choice very limited for breads/fruits and very busy. Noisy if staying when a wedding is on. Pleasant location but not a lot to do. Staff friendly and helpful. Gym was ok but pool needed a deep clean. ,3,2024,08,30
218,To long a wait,"Had to wait to long for room and rooms were very far away from facilities for anyone with disabilities

218,Small things can dissappoint,"Little things like checking in can impress r not., when they can't find your booking even though you have your ref number.  When you  requested bath robes in room & not there , room for 3 people & only enough towels , cups, glasses, for 2 people?. 
They offered to acknowledge a 21st birthday & nothing at all. ",4,2024,08,28
218,Need A good manager,"Call in for a bit of food living local ,, sat and waited for service, nobody came near us, had to walk around and look for a menu ,, sat for 20 minutes and had no choice except to leave with no food,, very disappointing ,, bar girl didn’t look at us once",1,2024,08,28
218,So much potential - but not quite there,"Lovely hotel and grounds but the family rooms (especially the bathrooms) are very dated.  We enjoyed the food and every staff member we encountered was very professional and friendly.  The hotel is marketed as family friendly and there are lots of children there, but the children'd activities need to be better organised and promoted (the movie night consisted of an empty function room with the door closed).  The playground was great though.  The service in the Larkspur lounge was terrible and chaotic due to it being very understaffed (1-2 staff doing everything from taking orders, making coffee, serving food and afternoon tea).  Breakfast was very busy in the morning so it wasn't very enjoyable.  We did enjoy our stay but with better management, more staff and enhanced kid's activities this place could be amazing. ",4,2024,08,28
218,Fell short of expectations,"Beautiful hotel, friendly reception staff. Great leisure centre, lovely gardens and great playground. However food and bar staff were terrible.  Food in the restaurant was average for the price, limited choices, long delays in service. Breakfast was fine but restaurant by mid-breakfast was very messy.",3,2024,08,27
218,exceptional staff,The staff at killashee are exceptional in their attention to customer needs.They couldn't be more welcoming or friendly. We celebrated our daughters 5th birthday while we were there and they made every effort to make her feel special.Lovely friendly family vibe with wonderful facilities.,5,2024,08,27
218,Excellent gem of a hotel,"There was little to fault this hotel. From the spa to the food to the staff, it's a fantastic experience. The hotel itself is full of character & the grounds are lovely for a walk around. Lovely atmosphere in the upstairs lounge, with live music played on the Saturday. The room was fantastic & very quiet. One of the best night's sleep I've had in a hotel. Breakfast was very nice, the fresh fruit & homemade granola was particularly good. The Spa is very nice, the hydrotherapy suite is very relaxing & nicely laid out. We had the Rasul Mud treatment which I would highly recommend, very good value & relaxing. 

We'll definitely be returning. ",5,2024,08,27
218,World Class Excellence!,"Myself and my wife had afternoon tea in the Pippin restaurant and it was a most enjoyable experience from start to finish.The staff were so professional and friendly in particular Ava and Sean who paid meticulous attention to our every need.From the time we entered until the time we left we enjoyed such a memorable day,Thank you so much.In my experience your staff and in particular Ava and Sean stood out head and shoulders above what you would expect,so what was I had thought would be an occasional afternoon tea turned into something very special........Hats off to you!",5,2024,08,25
218,Not for couples,"Crammed check-in line at reception, rooms not ready at 3pm. Sticky hand rails and smelly toilets. The room was lovely when we got there but the atmosphere was more like a playground. Lovely for families I'm sure but not couples. Maybe during off season it might be more relaxing.",3,2024,08,19

218,Killashee Hotel Stay,I stayed for two nights with my daughter and we found the staff to be excellent and very helpful. The leisure centre is bright and the pool warm and very large and was never crowded.  We also used the spa which we found to be nice but a little too warm however we were experiencing very warm weather during our stay.  We found the food in the Oak and Anvil to be excellent as was the service.  We loved the Larkspur lounge and found the staff here very helpful and friendly also.,5,2024,08,16
218,Enjoyable experience,"Beautiful hotel staff brilliant could not fault out stay 
Customer service in relation to a small matter regarding reservation request absolutely pathetic despite emails and calls never sorted or any effort made pity despite the enjoyable 2 days fell it very fake when a basic request goes ignored",4,2024,08,14
218,Bring your runners!,"First things first - the grounds and location are fantastic, the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating and the bar food - from a limited but varied menu - although a wee bit on the pricey side was nice, hot and well presented.

Unfortunately getting to the front door was a wee bit of a challenge - clue - it’s not the door into the historic house - and although there is a sign it wasn’t obvious from the (right hand) side car park. Maybe I’m getting on in years but I wasn’t sure if I’d gone through the right door until I saw a (small) sign for reception.

Check-in is quite late - 4pm - the staff on reception were lovely, polite and efficient and our room was ready well before 4pm.

Unfortunately getting to our room was a bit of a trek - and I’m glad I had my runners on! Two lifts - yes two - one up and one down (I’m not sure why a single lift couldn't serve all floors) and a bit of a trek through and along a few corridors.

Our room was large and spacious with two double beds, an en-suite bath/shower room, a safe, good storage, a large tv and - my wife’s delight - a Dyson hairdryer!

The bath/shower room was functional with lovely (so my wife said) washing products and plenty of towels.

Breakfast was OK - a selection of fruit, fruit juices, tea and coffee, cereals and cooked food. Unfortunately some of the hot food wasn’t as hot as it could be.

All in all the hotel is quite impressive, very easy to get to from Naas and the motorway, the staff are lovely and the food was grand. The grounds are well kept and beautiful at this time of year. 

If I was to give a small bit of advice to the hotel management it would be to:

Make the main front entrance a wee bit more obvious - it would be lovely to use the main historic house entrance the main entrance to the hotel - look at Lough Eske and Drumoland Castle.

Look at reducing the trek and number of lifts required to get to (some) bedrooms.

Pay a bit more attention to the room cleaning - note the dust on top of and behind the tv, (I was trying to find the on/off switch and not doing a “Four in a Bed” inspection) the iron stain on the floor and the discolouration to the toilet and shower screen bases.",3,2024,08,13
218,Beautiful place to stay,"Staff friendly, food fantastic, beautiful walks, rooms spotless, spa was beautiful, the pool is great for the kids too. Perfect Hotel for a relaxing break. I can't fault at all",5,2024,08,13
218,Amazing hotel with professional staff,I was impressed with the level of staff professionalism and how clean the hotel was. I wish I had to stay a bit longer but I couldn't due to cost,5,2024,08,12
218,Wonderful stay,Beautiful hotel and very safe location. It was very easy for us to travel all around Ireland from here. Great breakfast and wonderful lounge for drinks at the end of the day.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.,5,2024,08,11
218,Great experience at a beautiful castle,"This beatiful hotel is one of the best o have ever been .

Great service in an amazing castle ! I have to come back as soon as possible 💕",5,2024,08,09
218,Exveptional in All Ways,this hotel far exceeded our expectaions. the value for money was wonderful. full amazing breakfast. terrific rooms with ammenities. so clean and confortable would thoroughly recommend this hotel,5,2024,08,09
218,Well worth a visit,"We had a bit of a wait checking in but I have to put that down to arriving on a bank holiday Monday and I can only guess the household staff were very busy getting rooms ready so I do not believe that would be a common occurrence.
We had food in the 1st floor lounge and the ground floor bar and have to admit I could not fault the food, or the service, both was excellent.
We went to use the relaxation rooms but found they closed @ 6/6.30 and the pool area was a bit noisy (kids) so not a place you could relax and read a paper. The leisure area has an excellent Gym.
The only problem with the leisure complex is that it is about 100m+ away from the back hotel and as this is Ireland when it rains you are going to get wet.
The only problem I had with the hotel is the layout, in order for us to get to our rooms we had to go up one floor, walk the length of the hotel and then down 2 floors, it appears to be all a bit disjointed.
On saying that, it is a vet nice hotel, lovely decor, very comfortable, excellent rooms, excellent food & friendly staff, close enough to Dublin to get there easily and far enough away so as you don't get screwed by Dublin hotel prices.",4,2024,08,09
218,Excellent Family weekend away & specail occasion for all ages,"Arrived for Bank holiday weekend for a Family birthday with children, this was a wonderful property for any occasion for couples, families & kids and corporations. Warm friendly welcoming, clean bedroom and all public areas, very attentive friendly and engaging staff members across the hotel.
Jose, Kenneth & Luis were amazing in the bar looking after us engaging with kids & recommendations, The Food was amazing and highly recommend afternoon tea for a treat. In Restaurant Sean in Breakfast & Nitin at night were warm welcoming and always checking on any requirements we may need. Dominika gave a great facial massage in the Spa and the kids loved the pool, beautiful grounds to walk and sit around and a small play area with zipline for the kids.
Paul & Struan are Senior managers on duty for the weekend and they also were engaging with all their guests that were booked in for the weekend, there was a wedding every day and other functions there which created another buzz of people enjoying the property facilities. A great weekend retreat for all ages, and for corporate team building or that special wedding day - highly recommend this property that caters for everyone seamlessly- Great job and relaxing wonderful stay ",5,2024,08,07

218,Stay Again,"Nice hotel close to Dublin and convenient to Kildare village.Historic building set in nice gardens.Comfortable bedrooms and good breakfast .bar food ok but menu typical of almoest anyplace you visit i.e.  Beefburger, Buttermilk chicken burger , fish and chips etc, etc.Finding your way to bedrooms can be confusing as you have to use two lifts.Check in was very very slow and long queue had formed when we arrived and checkout was similar complicated by the fact that they were checking the incorrect rooms.However in spite of these little glitches we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again",4,2024,08,06
218,Very nice hotel,"Hotel is very lovely, enjoyed the lounge space and also the leisure centre. The room was quite large. Restaurant food was good. I will come back",4,2024,08,06
218,Quality accommodation and service,"My wife and I stayed for one night including dinner, bed and breakfast.  Our suite was modern, very clean and tidy and sumptuously furnished.  The evening meal in the Pippin Tree was to die for, the food was cooked to perfection and the service was exemplary. Breakfast was of equal quality.  The spa facilities are of a very high standard and were easily accessible from our room.",5,2024,08,05
218,Fabulous weekend getaway!,"I recently had a wonderful one night stay in Kilashee, the hospitality was second to none. The hotel is so picturesque and gardens and walks around it are lovely for a stroll. The bedrooms were very comfortable and the breakfast was delicious. It was managed very well on weekend in July.  Part of our package included the afternoon tea which was the highlight. It was the nicest afternoon tea I’ve ever had. Every item was delicious and baked on sight that day. The staff couldn’t have been friendlier. I would highly recommend Killashee Hotel for a weekend break for delicious food, service and comfort.",5,2024,08,05

218,Fantastic Stay,"Our room was immaculate. There wasn’t a speck of dust or dirt anywhere. Our bed was fabulous. So comfortable and our pillows were like sleeping on clouds. We had dinner in the Pippin Tree and got 3 courses. Food was 10/10 and our servers were even better. The pint of Coors was crisp and bottles of corona with lime were served with glasses of ice - perfection. Breakfast again in the Pippin Tree buffet style couldn’t be faulted. Fresh food, brilliant happy service and good atmosphere. Also can’t forget to mention the ladies at reception. They couldn’t have been more accommodating. Taking our bags on arrival and having them delivered to our room whilst we went to the Hydrotherapy suite. Warm pool, steam room, jets and more. Worth the money to stay in this fabulous hotel. The grounds itself are beautiful and a prime location to venture out of the hotel if needed. 100/10 stay overall. We will be back again.",5,2024,08,03
218,Not so family friendly,"Booked this hotel for a family friendly stay with it having all the grounds, playground and cinema/play rooms it seemed like a perfect location for a family break. We have 3 young children (1 a baby and 1 with autism)
On arrival we checked in and it seemed like a maze to get to the room having to get 2 lifts just to get to the room. Not easy with a pram, luggage and 2 other young kids.
We had dinner at the oak and anvil the menu does not provide much choice. On the kids menu I noticed there were no sausages but you could order sausages and chips from the kids menu as room service for 10 euro extra. I asked the waitress if she could ask could we have sausages for one of the kids (I have done this in many places and it is never a problem)  we were told this was not possible but yet I could have went back to the room and ordered them if I was willing to pay the 10 euro extra. 
The food was ok, nothing special and a lengthy wait with 3 young children. We ate out on the next night.
The breakfast was good and not too busy however we were sat at a dirty table the second morning and the high chair we were given was not cleaned it was covered in food from the last child. 
The hotel rooms are very hot with no air con and a fan that does not do anything for the heat. Seriously need air con in summer time as it was so hot and so uncomfortable to sleep in.
The hotel has a very over powering smell throughout like air freshners on the walls spraying out constantly throughout the place. It smells beautiful on first impression but does become sickening as the days go on. I also heard other guests comment on it being too much.
I did not get the family friendly feeling from the hotel it seemed to be a lot of older guests. Having stayed in 2 different hotels this week I found this place very over priced and not good value for money. Do not think we will visit again.",2,2024,08,03
218,Killashee Hotel Stay,"Stayed in the Killashee after having our wedding tasting menu. The food was delicious, the staff so helpful and kind and the hotel itself is beautiful from the gardens outside to the decor inside. Would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. ",5,2024,08,03

Kilashee is set in a beautiful area    for walks or just chilling outside  with one of their nice coffees  Our room was spotless and comfortable   we couldn't praise this hotel enough   it's well worth a visit  .,5,2024,07,29
218,Beautiful buildings and grounds,"I booked two rooms for a client retreat and couldn't have been happier. Great service, beautiful space, lots of outdoor areas to explore, and good food right in the hotel.",5,2024,07,29

218,Wonderful mid-week break,"Wonderful mid-week break at Killashee - great food, fab room, excellent spa and lovely grounds for a stroll!",5,2024,07,27
218,Great for overnight stay,Perfect for overnight stay taking in Kildare Village shopping trip. Comfortable rooms and great breakfast. ,4,2024,07,26
218,Beautiful hotel,"Such a beautiful hotel with all the amenities, great location, excellent Staff this is a must. Great options in the 2 restaurants on sight  ",5,2024,07,26
218,Disappointing,"Long wait to check in- only one person at reception desk at very busy time. We were then told the casual dining restaurant was fully booked- which wasn’t true. We went down to the restaurant an hour later and they offered us 3 different time slots so we felt like they were just trying to fill their fine dining restaurant. Service was quite poor in restaurant and food was horrible and overpriced, €7 for a portion of chips. We ordered the sourdough and dips small plate starter and received no sourdough but brown bread toasted cut into strips. 
We were told there would be a card and chocolate left in our bedroom for a birthday. Upon arrival, there was nothing. We said this at reception and something was put in the room- but the person knew we had complained so wasn’t ideal.
We had booked a triple room, which was only made up for 2 people- 2 towels etc. 
When we asked for extra towels at reception, we received extra toilet roll and lots of decaf coffee- but no towels. Breakfast was fantastic really nice and service was exceptional. We went to the hydrotherapy pool at the spa which was priced at €25 to use. We had booked a time slot, but when we arrived the pool was quite full with no seats/loungers for us to use, which I thought was weird after paying €75 for the three of us and booking ahead. After a few minutes, a group left so thankfully we did have room then. The pool is lovely, but that’s all we had access to (couldn’t use relaxation room etc.). When leaving, the showers were only cold so we couldn’t shower properly. We were offered to use the gym showers, but didn’t want to walk across facilities to get there to shower. Overall, nice experience but definitely priced too high- for what we received I would have expected to be complimentary with the hotel stay. Fantastic gardens- highlight of our stay.

218,A wonderful stay in a true Resort,The Killashee was recommended to us by our cousins who live in West Wicklow & Kildare. Our Suite was lovely & the staff is superb. The choice of restaurants & lounge is great and the food at each was well-priced and excellent.,5,2024,07,24
218,Family getaway,"I have stayed at the Killashee Hotel multiple times. It was my first visit with my family, and my grandchildren had a wonderful time. There were plenty of activities to keep them entertained, and it was great value for money.",5,2024,07,24
218,Fredak,Excellent hotel and location staff friendly could do with a better choice of food in the evening to choose from,5,2024,07,24
218,"Worth the money, luxurious resort.","A luxury hotel. Fantastic setting with the most beautiful manicured gardens. Good children's playground in woodland area. Pool and multiple eateries.
Positives: 
This resort has it all.
A pub, several cafes, fine dining restaurant and gastro bar.
Spa and leisure centre.
I did not visit the spa. However the 25metre pool and gym were very well appointed.
We ate in the Pippin restaurant , fabulous flawless food and service. 
Luxurious feel throughout.

Negatives: not deal breakers but slight issues  cooked breakfast excellent, cold selection poor.  Badly tasting yoghurt and muesli.
Room cleanliness not 100% immaculate dust in areas and debris under bed ( I was looking for something lol)
But the decor and comfort of the room was 10/10
Finally and a minor 1st world problem yoj have to leave the hotel and attend a separate building entirely for the leisure centre and the changing rooms aren't really plush. 
There's great comfort in a dash to your room in robe  or scruffs. But you have to get fully dressed here for the 5min commute.

Thanks Killashee we look forward to our next trip!!",5,2024,07,23
218,Great hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay. Beautiful hotel and grounds.
Staff very friendly and attentive.
Bit confusing to find our room but the staff were very helpful. ",5,2024,07,23
218,Very Enjoyable,Top Class venue and in the main very professional. An atmosphere that just makes you relax and chill out. Lovely Gardens to roam and stroll around. Always a buzz around the Hotel and judging by the numbers there a very popular place to stay. Dining areas very good and Larkspur Lounge a very relaxing place to have a drink. Staff very friendly and professional. Highly recommended!!    ,4,2024,07,21

Carefully designed hotel with restaurants .
Two restaurants to choose from and attentive staff. 
Rooms were luxurious and well equipped with fantastic shower and tea and coffee making facilities.
Great lounge upstairs for the end of the day or ear
Ire if you wanted a snack.
There is an spa and leisure centre.
Beautiful grounds andfamily friendly.",5,2024,07,19
218,Bit of a let down.,"No air conditioning in the hotel rooms is crazy. Could not get a nights sleep with the heat of the rooms, they provided a cheap room fan that you had to have on all night and was very noisy, so don’t expect a good sleep!

Reception is first floor, but you have to get a lift to the third floor, walk across the hotel, to get another lift back down to the first or second floor to access the bedrooms? How does that make any sense, or how is an elderly person supposed to manage that walk a couple of times a day? Bananas. 

Buffet breakfast is stone cold in the mornings, bring a microwave. 

Gardens and kids playground is lovely. Leisure centre and spa is a fifteen minute walk away from your bedroom, outdoors, so don’t expect to potter down in your dressing gown and slippers!",2,2024,07,19
218,A great stay,We had a wonderful time in Kilashee hotel. Staff were amazing. Rooms were a great layout but very warm during the night. Food was delicious but must say that there wasn't great options for my 7 year old daughter who is celiac. Overall a fabulous stay and we look forward to our next visit.,5,2024,07,19
218,Very disappointing,Must do much better . It’s a very good location and a fine hotel with lovely gardens but the staff are badly trained and therefore service is poor ,3,2024,07,18
218,Fantastic family get away,"First time staying. Absolutely blown away with the place. Caters to all family’s young and old. 10/10. 2 full blown football pitches (grass & Astro turf)
Great swimming pool (all be it, a little on the cooler side for my really young children 1&4. Great park and walking trails. Especially liked the open planned bar lounge on the 3rd floor. Well spread out for all sizes of family’s to enjoy. Well priced for a 2 night stay with 3 kids also. Will 100% be back ",5,2024,07,18
218,Coeliac at wedding,"The building and location are wonderful. Staff v v nice. Gluten free breakfast available to order separately & there is a gf station with separate toaster. I dont know if i missed all the pastries conjng down late but there was none in comparison to the ""normal"" pastry table. Confusion as to whether they had gf ketchup or not.  
Room v nice, some fussy people might notice that the wall wasn't finished being painted properly but this does not bother me. ",5,2024,07,17
218,Top Class,Absolutely wonderful stay at Killashee.  Hotel was beautiful.  Very friendly and efficient staff.  Food great.. What more could you ask for.  Bed was very comfortable and even though the hotel was busy it didn't negatively effect us as staff were amazing.,5,2024,07,15
218,Beautiful Hotel but terrible vegetarian menu choice,"We usually stay in another hotel when in the area but decided to try Killashee.
The hotel is beautiful with the majority of staff very attentive and helpful. However there were a few who let the hotel and their colleagues down. 
The real issue was the serious lack of vegetarian choice in both of the restaurants. Essentially there was no choice in the Pippin Restaurant as it was a risotto or nothing! In the Oak & Anvil it was a chickpea curry or a ‘super food’ salad. Not a great deal of imagination has been put into the menus which is out of step with other hotels and restaurants we have used. 
Orla, at checkout, was the only person who took an interest in our issue. She asked if we wanted to speak to someone about it but as she stated that she would pass our comments on there was no point repeating everything again. 
Unfortunately, despite the accommodation being comfortable and spacious, a return visit is unlikely. After a long drive all we want to do is relax and have dinner without the need to go out to find a restaurant.",3,2024,07,14
218,Fantastic Hotel,"Myself & Finacee went for a 1 night stay after we got engaged. Such a beautiful Hotel with staff being vwry friendly throughout our stay. We are now looking st going back to stay in Hotel in the near future to hopefully get married here.

218,Outstanding jewel,"The killashee wraps each guest in an elegant hug from the minute you part. Fabulous grounds welcome you and that sets the scene for the highest standards throughout your visit. Amazing food, the spa is outstanding but it is the staff who make it. All are so attentive and helpful - no trying to catch an eye the head staff are quick to manage the restaurant and bars which means tables always cleared. Plenty of families around with young children so it catered to all. Lovely playground and games ",5,2024,07,11
218,Wedding stay,"Overall I was slightly disappointed with my stay overall with inconveniences throughout that made my stay less than ideal.

Honestly the 4pm check in was the worst part of the stay and create issues throughout the day ",3,2024,07,10

218,Stay at Kilashee,"Very good hotel, with lovely well kept grounds. Good food and service, also good leisure facilities, with large swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi, although it would have added to the experience if there had been access to drinking water.  Hotel is well situated with easy access to sourrounding areas including Dublin.",4,2024,07,04
218,Our Killashee Hotel Stay,"I booked The Killashee Hotel outside Naas for me and my 2 children . From the get go we knew this was going to be a memorable stay and I have to say it was. The location is ideal for day trips to Dublin or the surrounding areas, the staff were fantastic and the hotel itself was just outstanding. We used the pool facilities on our first evening and the kids loved it. The Oak and Anvil Restaurant were very welcoming , we hadn't a reservation but they still were able to get us in even though it was fully booked and the food there was mouth watering , the kids loved the mash and gravy in particular. 
I want to thank the staff of the hotel for making our stay a memorable one and we will definitely go back again. Both my kids aged 8 & 10 give it five stars and I myself also give it five stars so I guess we give it 15 stars. 
Can't wait to return ",5,2024,07,03

Cherie is a really fantastic ambassador for Kilashee!

218,Comfortable Hotel for Business Event,"I attended a business event over the course of a weekend here and my stay was very comfortable and pleasant.  The layout of the hotel lends itself well to this type of event.  The food for breakfast and dinner was delicious.   It was also very nice to have the option of a leisure centre and spa, while attending for business. ",5,2024,07,02

218,True Irish Hospitality at Its Best,"We had a wonderful 3 night stay at Killashee Hotel. We particularly appreciated the excellent service of Front Office Manager Marie who went out of her way to be helpful to us and thus made our stay so nice. Her advise, professionalism and genuine desire to help us enjoy our stay was amazing. Our room was large, perfectly clean, quiet and well appointed. The morning breakfasts were great. We loved dinner at the Pippin Restaurant. It was so good we ate there twice! The grounds are beautiful and there are good walking trails in the area. We highly recommend a stay at Killashee and would return on another visit to Ireland.",5,2024,06,25
218,Best Booking Experience Ever,"We are not actually arriving at Killashee until July 7th to celebrate a special wedding anniversary but if the customer care I received when booking is anything to go by I can’t wait.
I spoke to a very friendly professional girl called Cherie who dealt with my booking  with 5⭐️ Excellence so a Big Thank You and I will be back with a review after our stay 😊⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2024,06,24
218,Pure luxury,"Myself and my twin teenage sons stayed in Kilashee last week and what a treat it was. We were given a family room which was very spacious and it have two double and one proper single bed ( not a pull out camp bed that most hotels off). The room was corner room so it had two windows which made the room lovely and airy despite rhe warm weather.  The hotel itself is set on a beautiful location with fabulous gardens to explore. The bars and restaurants are beautifully decorated and the lobby / reception area is very spacious and comfortable to relax in. We ate in the Pippin Tree restaurant as it was a birthday treat for one of us so we decided we could have the bar food anytime.  Its a fine dining experience and there is a set menu with your package if you opt for that, a full a la carte and an early bird , 5.30- 7.30 which was what we went for. 2 course for €33 which included fillet steak, so that was great value.
The hotel has a huge fitness centre, pool and gym which kept my two busy for hours , both on the afternoon we arrived and after breakfast the next day.
All in all it was a great experience and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Our only regret was we didnt stay a second night. We will be back for sure ",5,2024,06,24
218,Beautiful hotel with lovely gardens,Lovely hotel with the most magnificent grounds and friendly staff. Despite a wedding being held it didn’t impact our overall enjoyment of the hotel as there are plenty of social spaces in and out. Bedroom was spacious in the new wing and after two days in Sligo we decided to return to this hotel and cancel our third night at a similarly priced hotel to return and took a room in the main house which is also lovely. Breakfast selection is plentiful.,5,2024,06,23
218,Rest and Relaxation,"I stayed for one night with my daughter straight after her leaving cert. I asked for a quiet room and that’s what we got. The room was lovely with two double beds. The bathroom and shower were excellent. 
We had two full body massages on arrival and the entire experience in the spa was so relaxing and chilled out. We ate in the Pippin restaurant the staff there were very warm and the food was fantastic. We had breakfast in our room. We definately treated ourselves but feel we got value for our money as everything lived up to our expectation. I would definately recommend (great cocktail menu also)",5,2024,06,21
218,Beautiful hotel and surrounds,"A beautiful hotel and surrounds, such a warm welcome and high quality service. Great options for dining, lovely lounges for sitting. Impeccably clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend. ",5,2024,06,21

218,Lovely Hotel with a Homely Feel and Good Food,"We stayed in Killashee to celebrate a recent Engagement and Birthday in early June. It was a lovely stay that included wine tasting and dinner. I was also lucky to get a trip to the spa for a lovely facial. We met with the wedding co-ordinator Finnella who showed us around the venue and gardens as we are considering it as a potential location for our celebrations. Overall, a very enjoyable experience.",5,2024,06,18
218,Fabulous Hotel,"We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at Killashee Hotel. We got the Girls Package which included so much for the price of the stay.

218,Great stay in lovely hotel,"We had a lovely stay here ❤️  The staff make the hotel and every staff member was extremely friendly, polite and helpful. We had afternoon tea and were looked after by the wonderful Shauna. She was so lovely and attentive, a credit to the hotel. 
We also did the wine tasting experience and were looked after by Jeston. He was very informative with the wines and looked after everyone. At the breakfast this morning the lady who greeted us was so lovely and friendly, unfortunately I didn't catch her name. 
The hotel and the grounds are beautiful. We stayed in the main house in two ""suites"" they were older style but lovely. The elemis bathroom products are a nice touch. 

The only negative was that the leisure centre is in a different building so you can't go from your room in your robe direct to the pool/leisure centre. Also when we were there the sauna was broken and the jacuzzi was cold. I would have love to try the hydrotherapy pool from the spa but it cost €25 without a treatment and we were only going for an hour so couldn't justify it.

All in all a fantastic stay in a lovely hotel on lovely grounds. However, the thing that made it were the staff.",5,2024,06,15

218,Girls trip,"This was a nice 2 night break for the girls 
Everything was really nice with the exception of the unnecessary air freshener on each of the corridors. This left me with a constant sinus pain.
The food was fabulous and the breakfast was incredible ",4,2024,06,11
218,Miss Jacqueline Gale,I would highly recommend the Killashee hotel from the staff to the whole experience. I've been to the hotel a few times now and couldn't fault the staff or dining. I can't wait to return. 😊,5,2024,06,10
218,Excellent service,During our stay at the Killashee resort we encountered a very polite young staff member named Kate O’Meara when serving us during our breakfast staff came across quite energetic and vibrant employee that dealt with us with the upmost professionalism and was able to make recommendations about further things to do during our stay both in the resort and in Kildare itself! excellent experience of excellent customer service! 100% would stay again all staff are great and so helpful!,5,2024,06,09
218,Never again,"Been going here for years but finished now!! 860 for 2 nights,I'd rather lose it. Ridiculous. This Hotel was always a very good alternative to the Heritage in Killenard but not anymore. Its worse!! Lovely hotel but its completely overpriced now....",1,2024,06,07

218,They made our engagement trip so special. A fantastic hotel!,"I stayed for two nights with my partner, getting engaged on our first day at the hotel. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make our stay special, particularly the manager Marie. After our engagement, she took the time to congratulate us and ensure that things were sent to our room. A lovely touch! We stayed in a Junior Suite, which was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the elemis products in the bathroom were great. We ate at the Pippin Tree Restaurant for dinner one night and breakfast on two of the mornings. All meals were great, especially the way the breakfast worked so seamlessly between self-service and ordering from the staff. We also had lunch in their other restaurant on our first day, which again was great. The bar upstairs was spacious and comfortable for drinks. The young barman working on the 31st June gave us a great recommendation for a local takeaway and was really friendly in all our interactions with him. The hotel in general was great. Parts looked nearly decorated and it felt grand throughout!

There was a wedding everyday whilst we were there but the hotel was so spacious, it didn't impact on the guests staying. It was lovely to see! We didn't get a chance to use the spa, use the bikes or do all of the garden walks but we will definitely be back in the future on our next trip to Ireland to visit family. Thanks for a memorable and special stay!",5,2024,06,05
218,A large hotel just outside Dublin,"This is a very large hotel just outside Dublin.   It clearly specialises in conferences and functions.  The gardens are beautiful and worth walking around.  Our room was a little tired but nicely furnished with a spacious bathroom.  Unfortunately in this bathroom there was nowhere to put toothbrushes, toothpaste etc. as there was only a small stand alone basin despite there being plenty of room for a small table.   Dinner at The Pippin Restaurant was disappointing and at breakfast the choice was limited and the hot food had been sitting for too long.    While service was variable the reception staff were very helpful indeed taking time and trouble to assist us.",3,2024,06,05

Thank you for a very enjoyable stay . ",5,2024,05,28
218,It was okay.. likely wouldn’t be back again.,"The hotel itself is beautiful. Unfortunately The Pippin restaurant lets it down a lot. The staff are friendly but the food is below average. We had to send back a starter as the duck was so dry that it was inedible. They offered a substitute so we went with soup. That was lukewarm. For main, I had the vegetarian pasta and that was also lukewarm and looked as though it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while. It was also lacking a lot of flavour which was odd for basic tomato based sauce.. hard to get that wrong. Rooms are fine, bed was comfortable. We had an issue with the shower that night and next morning where there was no hot water for a shower. Despite running the hot water for 15 mins it never heated up. We rang reception and they sent someone up to check it and they asked if it was hot enough despite it being lukewarm and not hot. They offered us to change room but it was 2 hours pre check out and we’d have to move all our belongings so we just made do. Unfortunately for the price and having stayed in similar hotels with better food and facilities, I probably won’t be back.",3,2024,05,26
218,Beautiful stay,"Attended a wedding at the Kilashee, the staff, the food, the venue itself were all honestly fantastic.cannot fault a single thing. The room was lovely, so clean and spacious, but honestly I think that the standout was the food. The evening meal was among the best I've tasted in any hotel, and the fact that it was at a ""mass produced"" level but still couldn't find a fault with it speaks volumes on the quality. Breakfast was also delicious. Definitely hope to stay again!

218,May visit 2024,"I appreciated the Irish hospitality and non-complicated, simple surroundings that were left just as they once were, and I was able to move about the place like it was my own home!",5,2024,05,22
218,RB,Excellent DBB experience. We were made feel most welcome right thorugh from Check In to Check Out. Excellent dining experiences in Pippin Tree Restaurant. Encountered brilliant staffwho were both friendly & professional. Could not fault anything and would recommend Killashee Hotel without qualification.,5,2024,05,21
218,Beautiful Hotel food needs improvement,I attended a family communion here last week. We were sat at tables in a large function room. When I sat down I noticed the cutlery side plate and table cloth were covered in candle wax it seemed strange as I don’t remember there actually being candles on the table. When I pointed it out only the cutlery was changed. The food was quite poor. The Caesar salad was smaller than everyone else’s on the table as if it was the end of batch or something with very little dressing. Chicken was dry with a tiny drop of sauce. There were large bowls of overcooked yet lukewarm vegetables. Dessert was pretty good in fairness. It was very hard to get the attention of staff. It seemed there were a lot of them walking around but they lacked direction or purpose. There was no salt and pepper on the table I asked 4 different staff members before it eventually arrived half way through the meal. All I can say is I’m glad I wasn’t paying. The hotel itself is beautiful and the grounds are fabulous. The food  and service should be better though,3,2024,05,20

218,Beautiful hotel,Absolutely a beautiful hotel. Rooms were of decent size and beds were comfortable. Breakfast was good and there are a couple restaurants on site for lunch and diner.  Bus and train into city or surrounding areas only couple kilometers from hotel.,4,2024,05,17

218,Amazing hotel. Definitely will be back,"Had an amazing stay at the killashee, never stayed before and definitely won't be the last. The room was lovely, warm but expected in these old hotels. We did not book dinner but they helped get us a table at last minute. The only downside.... when I think of a spa hotel, I think of a spa with lovely lavender scents, a steam room with lovely scents, a calmness about the whole area. Except if you have not booked treatments... they direct you to the leisure centre side of things. We went when there were children's swim classes so just pure noise. No prior warning of this. I went to feel relaxed and not sure I got there.",4,2024,05,15
218,Rooms where a letdown beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel but was let down by the standard of the room, in need of refurbishment, bathrooms outdated with broken tiles.",4,2024,05,15

218,Well located and clean hotel for Business Meetings,"This hotel is very well located close to Dublin Airport for business meetings. The rooms are clean and well decorated and the food is good. Leisure Centre opens its class bookings to hotel guests, so was able to do spin in the morning. Rooms had a Dyson hairdryer which was a really nice touch and made a massive change from the slow poor quality hair dryers you usually get in hotel rooms. ",4,2024,05,13
218,Wonderful,"Stayed for one night in this wonderful hotel. Would definitely recommend. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. Had dinner in the bar and it was delicious with wonderful service, attentive but gave you space when needed. Exactly what you would hope for. If you were staying for a few nights the menu might be a little limited but since it was such good quality I don’t think it would really be an issue. Stayed here on a warm weekend and the towel rail would not switch off so the room was just too hot. Called reception and they tried to get it fixed but when it just couldn’t be fixed they put us in a new room within 10 mins. Did this with such ease and no fuss. I really think you can see the quality of a place and their team, when they have to  deal with the unexpected. They were so professional and kind. Breakfast was also lovely. Gardens and ground very pretty. 
Will definitely return!",5,2024,05,11
218,Excellent overnight stay,Staff very helpful pleasant and friendly delivering top class service. Room modern restful and tastefully furnished. Value for money excellent We availed of a pamper package Gardens are beautifully kept.Would definitely return and recommend to my friends,5,2024,05,11

218,A Beautiful Wedding Venue,"We attended from out of country for a wedding, along with other attendees from other countries.  The grounds are beautiful and the hotel is loaded with historical and architectural charm but has all the modern comforts we expect. Two restaurants on site were lovely and we never longed for a snack or a drink.  Parking was adequate but we didn't notice any valet service while we were there. The town is only a few kilometres down the road for a short break from festivities, if you need it. ",5,2024,05,08

218,New years stay!,"Had a lovely stay here over New Years, we had a junior suite and it was huge the bed was so comfy and spacious! Jacuzzi bath was a lovely touch too. Food in Oak & Anvil was amazing each day and the staff were all so friendly & helpful, the girls working in the restaurant New Year’s Eve were so lovely",5,2024,05,05
218,Yet again a wonderful stay,We have stayed at The Killashee many times whilst racing at Punchestown and the service is second to none.. From the moment we arrived ( even though very early we were able to check in ) to check out all members of staff went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay.,5,2024,05,05
218,Perfect for us.,"Friends and I have been staying at The Killashee Hotel for about twenty years, it is the only place we stay at when horse racing at Punchestown. The rooms are clean and tidy, the staff always helpful, friendly and welcome us back as though we were family. The bar area, restaurants and food are excellent and with recent upgrades and renovations even better. Would highly recommend, we always have an excellent stay and sorry to leave, will always return. Highly recommend.

218,Fantastic stay,"Had an overnight stay with dinner and breakfast followed by a facial in the Spa. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. The duty manager Cormac could not have done enough for us. He had such a lovely manner and was very professional. The hotel room was fantastic two double beds. We got breakfasts brought up to room and there was so much. Already planning another visit soon.
Well done guys 5/5",5,2024,05,01
218,"Luxurious hotel, no fridge, a bit of a labyrinth (ask for a map to your room)","A big group of us stayed overnight for a dinner at a university awards night.  We had all booked individual rooms, but - awkwardly - the hotel had suffered a water leak that effected several rooms and asked most of my colleagues to share rooms, while leaving me a room the size of a football pitch with two double beds.  (They reimbursed us for the cancelled rooms.]

So, the large football pitch?  It had most of the usual features, a nice bath tub, a hi-tech Dyson hair dryer, but no mini fridge for my Diet Coke.  I don't need anything to be pre-installed in the minibar, but it is useful to have somewhere to chill your supermarket beverages!  The bed was super-comfy; I am sure that the other one was too!

The route to the room reflects the scale and idiosyncrasies of an old stately home.  I had to ride an elevator from the reception to the 3rd floor, walk through a bar, then get another elevator back to the 1st floor and hike along a corridor to my room.  On the plus side, some of my younger and rowdier colleagues were still partying at the awards ceremony at 05:30, while I was fast asleep in blissful silence - miles away - by midnight.",4,2024,04,30

218,"A look-alike castle turned into a big ""Disney style ""hotel","The front of the hotel appears great,like a real Irish mansion with beautiful gardens  .Unfortunately the buildings in the back (where the rooms are located, and connected with the old building through jetways) with their squared shape , change everything once you realize that you are in Ireland but you can also be in Orlando or any other American big hotels with hundreds of guests. ...",3,2024,04,28

218,Good but could be better. Slow service in pippin. ,"My husband gave me, his mother and sister a spa  with afternoon tea voucher last Christmas. The hotel booked our afternn tea at 1pm. However our spa is supposed to be at 2pm. I rang and asked why because the afternn tea is only served from 1230-2pm. Very short period! Manager in pippin should have served the food systematically when we arrived because it had been arranged. However, it arrived at 145 so we were rushing to go back to the spa place. It hasn't occurred to him that we are running late for our appointment.  The service was slow that we ordered cocktails but it arrived after 20mins. Then we  wanted to pay for it and again we had to wait because they had to get the manager. Knowing that pippin doesn't have a clue that we still have to do the spa, I rang them and said we are running late coz we r waiting on a manager and food was only served at 145.
I loved the lady playing the harp but I think it is a shame because the service was slow here. Goats cheese canapé wasnt good. Maybe change it to a carrot cake with cream cheese instead. Maybe change the smoked salmon to a tuna melt. Scones were lovely. But they forgot to serve butter:((
The changing room should have hair drier in every corner. I had to dry my hair on a hand drier. Then they should add more shower area. Actually maybe an extension and refurbishing won't be a bad idea in the future. The buttons on the fountains doesn't work as well. I couldn't fault the ladies in the treatment room. It was a great massage and I felt so relaxed. The sorbet gave us a bit of a lift in the end. Maybe a cold water dispenser won't be a bad idea as well in the lounge area. ",4,2024,04,21

Really lovely weekend, Thank you to the whole Kilashee team.",5,2024,04,15
218,Great stay,"Unfortunately we only checked in for one night just to get away for a bit but our stay was lovely.
Haven't heard anything about this hotel really so it was whole new experience for us. We read reviews, some were good, some were bad and if we were to believe the bad ones... we wouldn't have stayed here.
The entire area is beautiful,  the gardens are very well taken care of. The inside of the Hotel is beautiful as well.
Our surprise was that we booked a normal double and when we got to the room it was obviously an upgrade which we are very happy about.
We served dinner in the Oak&Anvil restaurant and was very nice.
Staff both from reception and restaurant were very helpful and also the gentleman from the reception pool was very nice to us.
As I said... it was only one night but we had amazing fun.
Our daughter made friends at the Lounge where we stayed for live music and then she enjoyed the playroom sooo much. Also we all loved the children pool are. Water was warm.
Really happy with our stay and sorry that was very short.",5,2024,04,07
218,Stunning place 100% recommend,"Stunning place, beautiful gardens about 10 mins drive from naas Town, 10mins to naas racecourse upon arrival we where greated by very polite,friendly,helpful staff. 
The room was beautifully decorated, bed very comfortable, room warm however fan provided if required. 

The breakfast is buffet style advise early or mid times uses as after 9 it's very busy. 
Dinner in bar was fabulous nice choice on menu and reasonable prices. Service was brilliant and professional.

The lounge upstairs has great live music on Friday nights (we where luck we travelled easter break as there was music on each evening all great). Bar staff were friendly, customer focused and professional. 

looks to be a very family friendly hotel with playground on the grounds, movie nights and play room onside. 

Unfortunately the hotel couldn't accommodate my spa booking request as they where busy. I was very disappointed with this as I had emailed from the website few weeks before arrival no reply received,  I tried to ring the spa a few times with no answer. 
But reception took my spa booking request and had left message with spa to call me back which I did get a missed call to call spa back. Upon arrival I called to spa to be told they very busy and reception was not successfull booking my treatment request.
 I did have a look about the spa looks clean and a relaxing hydrotherapy suite at extra cost of 25 euro for guests i choose not to book this as the relaxation area was not included. Leisure centre has pool and sauna which is free. 

We also ate in naas town in maharajah Indian food and service was fabulous.  

I would recommend this hotel 100% and rebooting spa treatments well in advance is a must.",4,2024,04,06
218,Great Food,"We travelled from Limerick to a family funeral in Naas on 14th March and had lunch in the Killashee Hotel afterwards.

218,Function food a let down,"Attended an event here recently for aprox 200 guests.  The starters were just ok, but the main  course was shocking to be honest and I think an embarrassment to our hosts.   The jus on the beef was obviously out of a packet it was so salty , simply inedible and ruined the beef underneath. The fish main was simply a disgrace given Irelands reputation for sea food.   The vegetarian main course ( a vegetable curry ) was an absolute joke, you could taste chilly powder that had not bene cooked out, it had the consistency  of a thin soup ,  no depth if flavour no presentation etc. The waiters and waitresses were very nice and on clearing our table of 10 , and on seeing all the plates hardly touched asked tentatively if all was ok, we advised no the food was a complete let down but assured them it was not their fault, one said  “I know I am so sorry  “., The Bar was understaffed for the number of guests., as a result the staff there were under a lot of pressure and to be  honest were not dealing with it very well.  We did not stay the night.   A 3  if only for the  waiters and waitresses who did their very best.",3,2024,03,24
218,Leisure Break at Kilashee,Excellent stay welcoming professional staff. We were upgraded on arrival without requesting one which was a lovely treat. Food and service excellent . Fantastic leisure facilities. The spa was amazing . ,5,2024,03,22
218,"Just a warning, don’t leave anything behind","This was our first stay, which was marred by disappointment due to the dishonesty of the housekeeping staff. We left an Apple charger in a room after we checked out, and only realised this when we got home and unpacked the bag. We contacted the reception hoping they would post it to us, but they claimed it wasn't found.
The failure of the housekeeping staff to return the Apple charger reflects a serious lack of integrity within the hotel's operational practices. We ordered a new charger, which cost us £38 and thank God we didn’t leave anything more valuable than that. As a guest, I expect honesty and trustworthiness from the staff, especially regarding lost items. Such a negative experience tarnishes the hotel's reputation and raises questions about the overall reliability and honesty of its staff members.
The failure of the hotel staff to uphold basic standards of honesty and integrity has significantly detracted from our experience, resulting in disappointment and frustration, and not wanting to return to their premises again.
Efforts should be made to address these issues to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and to restore trust in the hotel's services.",2,2024,03,19
218,Biggest recomendations,"Received a voucher to visit Killashee Hotel and didnt regret one minute. Staff is very helpfull, everyone gives very calm, welcoming vibe. Room clean, spacious, quiet. Live music in the evening. Definitely recomend to everyone!",5,2024,03,18
218,Really great experience,"Gorgeous hotel set on beautiful grounds. Friendly staff, great food with fabulous bedrooms. There were 5 of us here for one night and we had a super time.

218,WeddingSuppliers.ie Awards,"Killashee House met our expectations as the chosen venue for our 'Weddingsuppliers.ie' 2nd Annual National Wedding Industry Awards, held on February 6th, 2024. From the onset, the Killashee team demonstrated professionalism and a deep understanding of the nuances of event planning, making the entire process not just manageable but also enjoyable.

The team & staff were consistently available, providing assistance whenever we needed it. This high level of service ensured that our communications were always efficient, allowing us to make quick decisions and adjustments as necessary.

218,Afternoon (Tea) Delight!,"My sister and I met at the Killashee House Hotel to treat a dear friend to Afternoon Tea on a miserable March Monday and it was indeed a delight. Despite the lack of atmosphere in the large but empty dining room (due to renovations being undertaken upstairs in the usual venue for Afternoon Tea) our waitress Shauna gave us a wonderful personal service which more than made up for the location. The food was lovely and fresh and we all enjoyed it. Shauna explained how the Afternoon Tea worked first and then plied us with fresh tea and coffee the entire afternoon! On a personal level I would like to see more savoury than sweet items on the plates but everything we got was lovely and even were given doggy bags to bring home what we couldn't consume on the premises :-) The china was so pretty, we all remarked on its beautiful gold pattern. Thank you Shauna and Killashee, we will be back.",5,2024,03,11
218,Fab,Our stay was fabulous. Everyone was so helpful. Breakfast was good. Dinner room decor was a bit lost character but food and service were top class. Duck was really really good. Hotel has everything pool steam sauna gardens for few steps after meal. Stunning setting.,5,2024,03,11
218,Good Break,"A perfect get away. We enjoyed all throughout hotel. Very good staff in general. Few stood out for us, Lauren served us afternoon Tea, she was so polite, Only negative in afternoon tea sweets were very very sweet and scones were not very pleasing. We also had dinner in main restaurant, girl from goa and indian manager were very attentive, cant remember the names. Spa facilities were very good. We will definitely return and highly recommend.",5,2024,03,07
218,Stunning hotel,"This hotel is old-school glamorous.  
Rooms:  My room was gorgeous, and the facilities were excellent.  The room was very clean, and the toiletries were high quality.

Food:  I had afternoon tea, which was fabulous.   My only grip was the tea, which clearly had been left to stew as it was like warm and very strong.  However, this was fixed with a pot of hot water.

Staff:  The reception staff were professional and friendly.   I found the staff of the Spa went above and beyond.   However, when we went for afternoon tea, we tried to add two additional guests, but they were not able to facilitate this.  My issue was the staff member wad very dismissive and did not offer an alternative dining experience to my guests.   They wnd3d up leaving the hotel and eating in another venue.

Overall, these are minor issues, and I would return to the hotel again.",4,2024,03,07

The staff here are so polite and friendly and we really felt welcome here which was fantastic!.

The hydro pool was amazing and we also enjoyed a delicious dinner at the Pippin Tree restaurant. ",4,2024,02,29
218,Accommodation quality issues. Not a hotel dfor a peaceful relaxing experience.,Need new beds or at least mattress in rooms. Noise from water tank repairs all night long. Not a peaceful or restfull sleep with the bed creaking every twitch you made. I would expect so much more from a 4 star resort especially charging 5 star prices for overnight stay.,1,2024,02,27

The food in the Pippin Tree was delicious (although the menu was quite limited- there were 4 choices of each starter/main/dessert.) The vegetarian option on the menu was a little unimaginative and so the chef was quite happy to offer another option which was really appreciated. All of the staff, without exception were friendly and happy to help. The pool in the thermal suite was lovely and relaxing - there were however only 5 loungers poolside and these were all occupied on our visit.",5,2024,02,26

218,Kilashee Shambles,"We went for an overnight stay at the Kilashee Hotel Nass, we had a one night stay+3 course dinner and breakfast. The voucher was worth €350 for one night. The room was excellent. The restaurant was not enjoyable the menu was pretentious the service was slow,with under trained staff. The food was not good, soup cold, main miniscule, left to dry out under a heat lamp, the desert was apple crumble, odd taste from it, we asked for some gravy still waiting.... We are also still waiting for our coffees. Given that our stay was inclusive of the meal. We left the restaurant and went back to our room, within one minute of getting to our room there was a knock on the door, the waiter was accusing us of not paying for our dinner I told him the dinner was included but he insisted on me signing for the meal. I informed the receptionist that I am not a thief and was not happy with their lack of professionalism. The next day we got an apology from the duty manager, he offered us a free meal in their crappy restaurant... Pass!!! ... I would not recommend this place, never again.",2,2024,02,24
218,Fab Girly Getaway!,"Girly Getaway! Treated like royalty. Would 1,000% recommend. Try the Killashee Cosmos 🍸 and make sure to go for a spa treatment. Dinner and breakfast at the Pippin Tree were amazing. If you’re looking for somewhere to just get away with your friends or your significant other, this is the place to go.",5,2024,02,22
218,Family break,"We had a nice family break for the feb mid term, the access was a little funny with having to go up one lift z& then down another to get to our room, but overall we had a very comfortable stay. The seating areas throughout the hotel are really relaxing, service at low in the level 3 area, but overall it was lovely.",4,2024,02,21
218,Lovely hotel,"Brilliant location, great staff and a fabulous breakfast what more do you want from a stay. Looks like a great place for a wedding. Entrance and grounds look incredible and coming into the staircase is a picture made for a couple being wed",4,2024,02,21
218,Nice hotel rooms too hot,"Room very hot can’t adjust temperature. Opened window and got fan from reception. Still to hot, had young baby with us and concerned about overheating so did not get good nights sleep. The hotel in general is nice ",3,2024,02,21
218,Excellent hotel,Cannot recommend this hotel enough. Very clean and lovely food and great location. Should be 5 star rated. All of the staff are so helpful without being in your face. There was a nice music entertainment at night in the lounge and the pool and spa are top class. ,5,2024,02,20
218,Killashee Hotel - super relaxing and comfort is the name of the game!,"I booked this as a surprise for my wife's birthday & was done kind of last minute after I changed my mind from an original booking for a different hotel, and all I can say is I'm so glad I did.
It's been years since we last stayed in Killashee Hotel, and the first thing that struck me was how well the hotel looked.  It had a look of just being done up, and it looked & felt like the warm & cozy hotel it is!
The staff are amazing, super friendly, nothing is a problem or hassle to them and they just make you feel at ease & relaxed.
I booked 2 rooms, one with a large king for ourselves and a double room for my grown up kids. Both rooms were super cozy, bed was lovely an comfy, tv in the room was huge which was cool.
The leisure center is one of the best I've been to in a hotel in a very long time, and no matter where in the hotel you are, the Staff were just great, they really made you feel relaxed.
Can't wait for our next stay!",5,2024,02,20
218,Could be so much better,"Beautiful location, facilities are good, food excellent, service is good. The downside house keeping need to be more vigilant as dirty towels were in the room. The smell when entering the hotel was nauseating. It felt a bit like a hostel with every table placed so close together in the restaurants. The house suite had a wind whistle which kept us awake most of the night eventually exhaustion wins out",3,2024,02,18
218,Galentines Trip,"We stayed here for a night using the Starry Night package. It was definitely worth it. The hotel was stunning and the hydrotherapy pool is so relaxing. 
the staff are also lovely and so helpful. Especially Daniel! 🫶🏻
",5,2024,02,17
218,Afternoon Tea,Myself & a friend & my daughter went for afternoon tea to this hotel and from start to finish it was faultless. Our server was a beautiful efficient & friendly girl called Shauna who was a credit to the hotel in every respect. Nothing was too much trouble. After enquiring & discovering we were there for a birthday celebration a little treat arrived & was much appreciated. The food itself was gorgeous; the atmosphere convivial & the attention to detail apparent everywhere. We will be back.,5,2024,02,16
218,Disappointing,"Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend the hotel due to very inconsistent service (some staff members were lovely but others were downright rude), dining is a very regimented experience which is tricky with your children, and the pool is pretty horrible- basically a noisy, overcrowded public pool.",2,2024,02,16
218,Terrible Spa Experience,"My partner and I went for a Valentines Day spa break, we’d signed up for the dry floatation and massage and facial package. 
During the dry floatation the staff didn’t turn the lights off and left me laying there under bright LED lights, also a dance class was happening directly above with ‘Flashdance’ playing REALLY loudly. As much as I love this song this was incredibly annoying. I complained and staff didn’t even apologise. My partner also complained in the next room and was told we wouldn’t be charged (fine)…then, when I went for my massage and facial all I could hear through the whole thing was what either sounded like construction or a hedge trimmer right outside. I couldn’t believe it, it was the most non-relaxing spa day I’ve ever had. I asked the masseuse ‘is there construction going on outside?’ in disbelief and she responded with a giggle ‘yeah I think so’. Not to mention all the door slamming and chatter you can hear from the building while laying there. 
It was a bad experience all around, and the locker rooms weren’t nice either.",2,2024,02,16
218,Beautiful place,The hotel was beautiful the staff were wonderful the only issue was the heat in the room so if staying then open the window on arrival and pack summer pyjamas. The breakfast was gorgeous and topped up regularly ,4,2024,02,16
218,Awesome,"My only complaint was the noisy neighbor's across from my room, this was out of the hotels control and unfortunately some people have no manners and respect for others. This hotel is wonderful however and I was overwhelmed at how beautiful it was and how wonderful the staff are. ",4,2024,02,15
218,Highly recommend,"Beautiful hotel. Couldn’t fault it. Hydrotherapy pool is a must. Food was excellent. Staff were all friendly. Good location, close to Kildare Village and newbridge whitewater shopping centre for shopping. ",5,2024,02,15
218,Good to be back,A massive improvement on this time last year. This was our wedding venue 14 years ago and it’s good to see it back to its former glory. Staff and management are very professional and helpful. The room was lovely with great attention to detail and very welcoming. The food in the restaurant is good but the menu is a bit limited. Restaurant service was very good. The table beside us complained their food was cold on arrival but we had no problems. The upstairs bar staff were a bit inexperienced but nothing too drastic. Drinks are on the expensive side. The pool is great for the kids and available after checking out. The grounds and gardens are very nice. The fire juggler at the entrance was an interesting and nice touch for kids arriving.,5,2024,02,13
218,NOT ENOUGH STARS FOR THIS HOTEL - EXCEPTION - STAFF & MANAGEMENT ARE FANTASTIC,"Stayed at this hotel for an event, from start to finish each member of staff was so helpful,  from the food at the event to breakfast the following morning,  thank you so much Kilashee for wonderful stay ",5,2024,02,13
218,Great meal at a large function,"I attended the Wedding Supplier Awards recently and I have to give credit where credit is due, the standard of the food at a 4 course dinner with over 400 guests was exceptional, each dish was packed with flavour, presented beautifully and  more importantly served hot.",5,2024,02,13
218,Lovely place,"I've visited killashee Hotel and spa over the weekend. Beautiful place very calming , relaxing and clean ❤️ 
At the spa Joanna took amazing care of me , very professional and knowledgeable lady with passion and good energy. Had few treatments that made me feel like I am in heaven.  Reception staff also were very smiley and helpful. I've also had a lunch at oak and avil restaurant which was delicious and tasty and the highest level . I highly recommend Killashee Hotel and spa 😌.  Definitely coming back 🥰",5,2024,02,11
218,Great hotel - amazing Staff!!,"It’s often the staff that make a great hotel excellent and this is definitely that case with the Killashee! 
The place is full of amazing humans - go just to feel the warmth, if nothing else!
The hotel itself is amazing, old so expect a plug socket to be in the ‘wrong’ place, but then step back and look at your surroundings!!",5,2024,02,10
218,Beautiful from start to finish,"I have to mention Paul who is the food & beverages Manager, I'm sure he is a very valued employee of this hotel and has to be commended as he is was outstanding in every single way, his attention to every detail to make your stay memorabile has to be applauded ""Well done Paul"" The food was amazing in The Pippen Tree, fine dining at it's best (the chef was top class) the staff couldn't be any more helpful. Our suite was big, airy but more importantly quite & very comfortable, everything was 5* and we will definitely be back.  ",5,2024,02,09
218,An Okay Experience Overall,"We stayed at the Killashee hotel on the Girls Getaway package and stayed for 1 night. The Spa treatments were great and the thermal facilities were fabulous. Spa staff were also lovely!!

The room itself was nice and spacious, beds comfortable and very warm. Could do with some upgrades due to wear and tear.

The food in the Pippin Tree restaurant was just okay, with a very limited menu. The staff throughout the Killashee in general were not very friendly and the service is really what impacts the experience. The staff in the Pippin Tree seemed scattered and on multiple occasions forgot parts of our food and drinks order. The same goes for the bar staff - it was like placing an order was just hassle for the staff and they’d rather just be left alone.

All in all, it was an okay experience but wouldn’t be rushing back.",3,2024,02,09
218,An home coming  atmosphere created from the moment of arrival.,"From arrival to departure this wonderful hotel’s reputation has been built by the amazing staff who took great care of us. Apart from the beautiful Manor House, the gardens, the rooms, the food and lounges, attentive, discrete, yet personal attention to detail and conviviality made our stay. Just super amazing.",5,2024,02,07
218,Excellent Spa - Will Return,"Myself and my friends had a wonderful stay. The food in the hotel was excellent. We had the pleasure of using the Spa on Saturday, our treatments were second to none. Every single member of staff we met were not only friendly but seemed to love working there. We had the most relaxing day and we cannot wait to return! Thanks so much!",5,2024,02,05
218,5 Star Service,"We were really looking forward to our stay and we were not disappointed. Well we went to book a table for our dinner but the restaurant was fully booked, only 915 was free but the gent advised us to come back in couple of hours and check again. We got table at time we generally eat and food service were both excellent. Even we were told dishes we ate and chair pulled for my wife which she is not used to...Zero complaints. Highly recommend hotel killashee and wonderful staff",5,2024,02,05
218,Hotel and spa not accessible to those with mobility issues,"Travelled with a friend with mobility issues. Booked a twin room, close to elevator - was given a double room at the very far end of the corridor. 
Booked the thermal suite - this is inaccessible to someone with mobility issues but this information is not provided on booking. Hotel did not provide alternative transport to spa which is a long walk around the back of the hotel or down steps if you go through the hotel, making it inaccessible. In addition, the thermal suite was busy, noisy which did not provide the relaxing experience you would expect. 

Very poor & disappointing experience. Do not book if you have mobility issues.",1,2024,02,03
218,Lovely stay at Killashee,Wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel for a girls trip. Bedroom was fab and all staff very helpful . Lovely time at the hydrotherapy suite . We had dinner in the bar and enjoyed that too Definitely will be back.,5,2024,01,31
218,Nice hotel - some improvements can be made,"A beautiful historical hotel. We stayed in an 'old house suite'. The room was old style furniture and looked out onto the front of the hotel. The bathroom was tiny and not very clean. The TV did not work on arrival but reception sorted it out later that night. The tv was not 43 inch as advertised when we booked. It also did not have netflix on it. The hotel decor was beautiful however it does need to make improvements with cleanliness (carpets, cutlery, plates). In the larkspur restaurant there was a number of flies lingering around our table / drinks. We Spent a day in the spa - treatments were amazing. The hydropool is well below standard and would not be worth the extra cost. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful throughout our stay.",3,2024,01,30
218,Unforgettable experience,"What a treat. We booked a package with acoomodation, dinner and access to the Hydrotherapy pool included. Everything about the hotel was fantastic, beautiful facilities, gorgeous food and professional, attentive and friendly staff. All the staff we spoke to were engaging and welcoming and we were truly made to feel valued on our stay. I could recommend Killashee House Hotel strongly enough and want to thank all the staff for being amazing. Thanks!",5,2024,01,30
218,Amazing hotel and food,"Had some problems at check in that were later resolved. Fabulous hotel and stay, food was amazing and the thermal suite was very relaxing. Would love to come back again.we were upgraded to a junior suite for our stay and the room was amazing.",4,2024,01,30
218,very relaxing break,This is a lovely hotel. The spa and hydrotherapy room are nice. Food in the pippin restaurant was very good. Breakfast was also very good too. The bedroom was a good size as was the bathroom. Overall a very nice stay. The different levels tat the hotels can make it a bit difficult to get around the hotel but you  get the hang of it quickly enough. ,5,2024,01,29
218,ideal for a relaxing break,"rooms are great and so quiet and relaxing.  We loved our few days break away at this hotel, ideal for a  break to recharge.  beds and pillows are great and food was great.  there was  a relaxing lounge to sit and people watch or do a bit of reading.  they didn't have any entertainment while were were there and we didn't ask but I'm sure they do have an busy times. we walked to the nearest town of naas which took about 20 minutes. Well worth a visit for a  few days to unwind.  lovely staff and very helpful.  we'll be back!",5,2024,01,28
218,Lovely stay,"Beautiful hotel, very friendly helpful staff. Room was very well priced and very large. It was exceptionally warm in room and although a fan was provided it was not very effective as we could not turn off the radiator. 
Breakfast was lovely and the meal we had in the oak and anvil was also very good. The residents bar area is great, ",4,2024,01,28
218,Luxury Shopping Experience,"We had an amazing stay at this fabulous hotel.  The hotel is situated in stunning grounds and has fabulous facilities. The Luxury Shopping Experience was selected as I wanted something different to celebrate my Aunt’s 80th and it did not disappoint. I was a little skeptical about the chauffeur feeling it would be a taxi like experience but I was very wrong, Patrick was amazing, friendly, accommodating, helpful, knowledgeable and he really made my aunt feel that little bit of luxury in the way that he lifted and laid her. His wife Marion also works at the hotel and is also super friendly and helpful. Clare and Suzanne in the Oak and Anvil are outstanding too and both went above and beyond to ensure that we had the most amazing dining experience supported by our waiter Josep. 
You would be hard pushed to find more friendly, flexible and accommodating staff … my mum and aunt loved that they took time to be friendly and helpful! Thank you fior a great experience! 
I’ve given a 4 for location as it is out of the way but the chauffeur service does make it a 5 especially when you consider the fabulous grounds. ",5,2024,01,27
218,Beautiful hotel,"From the moment we arrived we felt we were on holidays.  Very relaxing stay with friendly, efficient staff.  Rooms are quiet and comfortable and the decor in the hotel is beautiful.  Would highly recommend and will be back.",5,2024,01,24
218,Amazing. Five star staff!,"Amazing one night staff for an anniversary. We got an offer that included 3 course meal, breakfast and spa access. Honestly a beautiful hotel, soon as we walked in we were hit with a beautiful smell and the brightest reception! High ceiling and amazing decor, pure luxury! The spa was great, very busy but the hotel was packed in general, it was great seeing all types of groups! We were a couple a had an amazing time overall. Had a meal in the pippin tree and the food was great! The staff were so lovely throughout the entire hotel, even at breakfast the next morning the staff were run off their feet but still incredibly helpful and on their game. Would 100% return, have already recommended to our friends for special occasion. Would return in the summer to enjoy the grounds more! ",5,2024,01,23
218,Pleasant,"Very pleasant stay. Rooms are lovely. We used pool and gymnasium, nice and relaxing jacuzzi sauna room. Food was excellent in Pippin tree as part of our deal. All staff was very attentive and polite even though they were so busy. Enjoyed breakfast too and walk around gardens. Cold weather and warm hospitality.",5,2024,01,22
218,Lovely Stay but an issue with the hotel room cleanliness,"We had a two night break with a meal in the Pippin Restaurant - we came from England and always wanted to stay here - The hotel is beautiful and the Staff very friendly - the food in the Pippin restaurant was Excellent - The breakfast was good 
We did however not get off to a good start as our Room although we arrived at 17.30 was not cleaned as it should have been - it had not been hoovered and there was a pair of Knickers under the cushion on the arm chair - also no glasses to drink our water - housekeeping did bring us glasses and dressing gowns with some chocolates to apologise but not the start we expected - it would not put me off returning ",4,2024,01,18
218,Family get together,We had a family get together and it was meant to be about 25 people but 40 turned up and we all stayed the night it was amazing.the hotel staff were so nice..they had a guy singing it was a Sunday we all had a great time,5,2024,01,17
218,Nice break,Hotel suite room nice decor and big in size. Bathroom nice and big  Spa staff friendly  and treatments  were good. Pippin Restaurant nice decor but food portions small and limited. Bar staff friendly  and attentive. ,3,2024,01,17
218,Excellent overnight stay,"Myself and my wife enjoyed an overnight stay with dinner and a spa treatment in January. We had a wonderful visit, would highly recommend. 
The hotel was very busy but always had good attention from the staff. ",5,2024,01,16
218,January refresh in the best Spa and Hotel.,"From the beginning to the end of our stay we felt nothing but pure relaxation and pampering.
The Staff in both the spa and the hotel could not do enough for us.
We arrived to the Spa and were shown to the changing rooms.
We used the hydrotherapy pool which was warm and relaxing and then onto our treatments.
We had booked a facial with Anna whom I have to say was excellent she has a beautiful calming presence and is very knowledgeable, we were glowing afterwards. Then onto the relaxation suite afterwards for a peppermint tea and sorbet and a glass of prosecco.
From there we checked into our room which was beautiful.
Large spacious with a huge bathroom .
Only downside here was it was a little cold but that was solved by fiddling with the heater.
We had our meal in the Oak and Anvil and the food was delicious and the Staff were so lovely and friendly.
We ended the evening in bar upstairs with a few drinks.
Breakfast was really nice loads of choice.
We then headed back to the spa where we were greated by name by the lovely Karina and shown to the changing rooms again .
Today we used the pool again had a dry floatation treatment and the risul mud treatment and we had the loveliest room for this for an hour . 
Our skins were so soft we felt like we had slept for hours .
Back to the hotel then for afternoon tea.
I had forgotten my phone charger and had emails I needed to check.
The lovely girl in the pippin tree who's name I didn't get went out of her way to get me usb C charger.
All in all it was a fabulous stay and exactly what we needed to wind down after a very busy Christmas season.",5,2024,01,15
218,Business trip,Service was good and the staff were very friendly and efficient. Just the distance to the room was a bit of trek. Also the leisure centre is a good distance away and thats why I did not avail of it. The room was lovely and warm and the bed was comfortable . Breakfast was excvellent.,4,2024,01,12
218,January stay,Some of the service was quite poor as was some of the food. On both lunch and dinner.  Cold soup for both of us having to ask for a soup spoon to eat it more than once and cold shower in the bedroom. Decor is lovely. ,3,2024,01,09
218,Noel and Anne December 2023,"Great stay in the Killashee Hotel in Naas. First time there but definitely not the last. Excellent staff and facilities. Great food. All staff were so helpful, courteous and couldn't do enough to make our 2-night stay so enjoyable. We'll be back definitely.",5,2024,01,08
218,Lovely hotel for friends or family trips,"We did a last minute overnight trip with friends over Christmas the hotel is beautiful and an added bonus was watching the wedding style. Staff lovely, couldn't be more helpful. We'll be back. Good for children too",5,2024,01,07
218,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, went for night away as a couple hoping for a quiet night - spa treatment etc 
Wedding on and loads of kids - just not what we had hoped for but didn’t ruin the experience. Staff are all lovely, food gorgeous and spa heavenly ",4,2024,01,07
218,"Overnight stay, spa treatment, dinner and breakfast ","I won an overnight stay with a spa treatment for myself and my husband, dinner and breakfast was also included. The food was absolutely delicious. The spa was amazing and so relaxing. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful. I am always cold and was so happy the hotel was so warm and well heated.  Can't wait to return. ",5,2024,01,06
218,Lovely hotel and staff,"Fab hotel, we stayed in the old house wing in an original house suite and would highly recommend. Beds incredibly comfortable and room very luxurious. Staff very friendly and helpful and bar food is superb. ",5,2024,01,05
218,Great hotel,"What can we say, only what a fantastic hotel and spa, we have just had a lovely 2 night stay and it is one of the best hotels we have been to. From you walk in the front door nothing is a problem, staff are very helpful and very friendly, food was amazing in both restaurants and breakfast was very tasty, choices for all, the grounds are absolutely fabulous too with lovely walk ways and gardens, thank you for a great stay, we will definitely be back.",5,2024,01,05
218,Post Xmas Break,Hotel is very nice and the location is superb. Post Christmas it was very busy with people getting away for some rest before the holiday season is over. Couple of things to note which didn’t really affect our experience too much were the lack of sufficient hot water in bathroom and children in bedroom attire in restaurant for breakfast. Now I have been that ‘soldier’ away with young children in times past but there are limits to be fair. Food in restaurant  was very good and not overly priced. Wait time was fine and the breakfast was adequate but room was a bit noisy. We understand everyone is entitled to enjoy themselves as they see fit but for a 4 Star facility there needs to be a quieter area that couples can chat without having to raise voices occasionally at meal times. As stated our overall experience was good and we won’t fault the hotel for what might be a trivial matter. Next time might be different!,4,2024,01,05
218,A special place for a special occasion,"The inside of the hotel is much better than you’d expect - fresh, light atmosphere, upgraded furniture, exclusive details. Great service and great vibes both from the outside and the inside, totally recommend this place!",5,2024,01,04
218,A nice hotel but needs a lot of work.,"Nice food and friendly staff but lacked organization- no specific staff assigned to our table and had to wait for a long time for service. There was a very big crowd for breakfast and in my opinion the staff were not enough- running out of food, couldn’t get anyone’s attention to order, tables too close together. 
The main flaw was the stifling hot room, no temperature control. The open window didn’t make much difference. A very poor night sleep meant leaving the hotel feeling groggy and unrested- not the way you expect to leave a relaxing hotel stay. Receptionist was well aware of heating issue but no apology made. ",2,2024,01,04
218,New year break,"Hotel was busy with being New Years, bar had to be booked ahead of wanting food, but availability was available in the restaurant. We were a couple away so not wanting to be around children for a break but were seated in the middle of two screaming families which wasn’t ideal. I would suggest staff seating couples away from families for this reason. Food was fab, hotel and rooms were extremely warm, breakfast was gorgeous, staff really were exceptional. Jacuzzi in the main pool area was cold, and decor to the suites was very poor quality finish. Room was lovely but we had found some ladies jewellery on the floor. Overall lovely hotel and will be back. Would suggest having extra options on late night room service as in snacks etc ",4,2024,01,03
218,Very nice place but overpriced Bed and Breakfast,"Very nice hotel, I love the history of it as a former school, found that fascinating.  We attended a wedding there.  Service was very slow and when I asked for more mash and beef I was told no.  Room was overpriced for a compact but comfortable room in fairness at €350 for the night.  ",3,2024,01,03
218,Would not return.  Overpriced. Not a good experience.,"Not worth the money.  Receptionist was in the middle of checking us in, when another staff member came with an issue. She proceeded to deal with that staff member rather than continue to check us in.  Room very difficult to find. Had to go 2 flights of stairs, pass through bar/customers on 1st floor landing, across endless corridors,  down another 2 flights of stairs and more corridors to find room. No heating on in room. Rang reception. Staff member called to room - to be told heating on timer and would conr on at 6pm. Not good enough during a cold December day.  Breakfast very poor. Sausages only cooked on one side! Poor quality rashers. Had to ask 4 times for coffee. Bar food expensive for what it is.  Very little privacy between the tables. Overall not an enjoyable experience. Definitely not worth €195 per night. Would not return. ",2,2024,01,02
218,Amazing all Rounder!,"Can't wait to come back. Food was delicious, hotel was gorgeous, no paint peeling in sight! The room was very comfy, lots of pillows and duvet was good quality. Lots for kids to do, a playrooms playground and fabulous grounds for exploring. ",5,2024,01,02
218,Hidden gem,"Stayed two nights with my wife and kids, the place is amazing, first time we’ve had a decent sized room and everything you need for a relaxing break. Only fault I had was the lack of choice for the kids food, they had same food for lunch and dinner! One other thing was the food could be of a higher standard and served hotter, nothing worse than luke warm meals. On a more positive note we didn’t want to leave and will most definitely return in the future. ",5,2024,01,01
218,Overnight getaway,"Fantastic food in the Pippin Tree restaurant was the highlight of our short stay, as well as the beautiful relaxation room in the Spa at Killashee. Busy hotel with many families, couples, wedding groups, friends. Excellent evening music entertainment in the upstairs lobby and wonderful ambience from the musician (in the otherwise noisy restaurant) at dinner. Wonderfully comfortable beds in spacious rooms in this huge hotel. Large grounds with lovely gardens and well decorated spaces throughout. The staff were all fantastic and friendly, and Killashee is in a great location near Naas and M7/M9 motorway.",4,2024,01,01
218,Couples stay ,"My partner and I stayed here New Years Eve. We did have a fabulous evening and night, the food in Oak and Anvil was absolutely fantastic and the staff in here are fabulous ! The live music and atmosphere was wonderful for New Years and I would have gave full stars and returned if we got one wink of sleep. The downfall was the noisy corridor and neighbouring room who were loud talking and banging doors until 5am. Drunk people made noise until all hours all night and banging the hotel room doors, we were absolutely exhausted the following day and on our long drive home. This hotel is absolutely wonderful but I would recommend soundproofing the rooms, the noise was the worst we have experienced in a hotel. ",4,2024,01,01
218,Pretty but that's it,"The hotel is beautiful but I would expect much more in quality and service for what you pay.  If you book the spa or want to use the gym, be prepared to walk outside across a large parking lot in wind and rain to get there.",3,2023,12,31
218,Worth a stay - would happily go back,"A great resort
Nice rooms and temperature in the rooms
Good food and atmosphere, both for breakfast and dinner
Good parking spaces
Pleasant bar area with good service
Apparently the gardens around are also very nice, but unfortunately we didn’t have time to see them",5,2023,12,31
218,Rude older secretary,At the end of our night away we checked out and the first secretary we met must have never put through our gift voucher and the older secretary rudely didn’t believe us that we paid not allowing us tell our story! AND NEVER APOLOGISED ! ,4,2023,12,27
218,One night stay in killashee House Hotel,"Very pleased with stay in Killashee house hotel. Location was very good. Staff were helpful and friendly. Bedrooms were very spacious and twin room had two double beds, a fine television and all the other trimmings. Evening dinner was very good and had a good variety for each course. It was a relaxing stay away from the noise and bustle of city hotels.",5,2023,12,24
218,Staff and gardens were great.,"Lovely hotel and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. We ate in the oak and anvil and the service was great, very fast and the food was delicious. The twin room was very big with two very comfortable Queen beds and a lovely view over the gardens. We also had breakfast included which is hot and cold buffet not seated service, ideal if like me you have to try everything . The bathroom was a little dated and room was way too hot.  The elevator was still out of order when we were there mid December.",4,2023,12,24
218,A lovely hotel experience ,Spent a pre Christmas treat with my daughter in this lovely hotel. The rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds & fluffy pillows. All the staff were very friendly. We had a most enjoyable meal in the Oak & Anvil. We were served  by a lovely waitress Keelan & manager Claire took time to chat & ensure we enjoyed our meal.  Jeston in the bar was very friendly and made us delicious cocktails.  We look forward to a return visit. Would highly recommend a stay in this beautiful hotel. ,5,2023,12,24
218,Trip with newborn baby,"Nice hotel at Christmas time - Good food and friendly staff - 

We had our 4 week old son with us and we were looked after really well. There were lots of other couples with babies there and it was really nice - it’s certainly a family friendly hotel

The only downside was that the Hotel rooms are massively over heated leaving it very uncomfortable and hard to sleep

218,Spectacular stay! ,"From start to finish our stay at Killashee hotel was impeccable. I stayed with a friend under the ‘girlie getaway’ package and it was nothing short of spectacular. On arrival, we were greeted by the loveliest staff at reception who kindly took our bags as we were a little early. However, we were able to begin our session in the hydrotherapy suite even before checkin as our treatments were just around then. The changing rooms were so spacious and we were provided with everything we needed for our session. The pool made our skin feel so soft! The staff in the spa were so kind and caring but also knowledgeable about everything they were doing and using. We had an unbelievable experience in the spa. Afterwards we were treated with tea and sorbet. We also dined in the Pippin Tree. We were made feel like absolutely stars by the staff. Everything was so fancy and formal a real treat. The food, deserves and entire rave review of its own! It was nothing short of exquisite! Our entire stay from start to finish was remarkable and I will definitely be returning!",5,2023,12,19

218,"The Staff are great, but the hotel is dated","The room was very hard to get to like a maze.  When you got to the room it was nice, but the bathroom was terrible, not very clean and the shower flooded the whole room.  The room was also very hot during the night and we did not know how to turn down the heat.  The bed was very comfortable and clean.   The check in was a bit stressful regarding rooms, i also asked for rooms to be together but they were not, i didnt know where the other rooms where in the maze of a hotel.  The drive up to the hotel was very impressive and when you walk in, but the journey to your room and the room itself was dissapointing.  The lift broke on the day we were leaving!",1,2023,12,12

218,Sunday Stay.,"It was our first stay here and we were very impressed. 
It is a spacious hotel with beautiful decor. There are plenty of places to relax in the reception and upstairs lounge area.  
We availed of the dinner package which was great value, dinner was excellent, I couldn't fault it. 
Our room was spacious, with a spacious ensuite, double sink and a walk in shower as well as a bath. 
Water was provided in the room too.
The staff were friendly and professional. 
The hotel is in a great location, loads of great shopping nearby. 
We will definitely return and I have no hesitation in recommending Killashee. 
It's a perfect hotel for couples who want a romantic getaway, to families who need space, to friends who want a reunion while taking in shopping and the Spa. ",5,2023,11,08
218,"Amazing stay, fantastic hotel and staff","I held a 50th party in the Snug bar and it was fabulous, intimate (50 guests) and it was fun, lovely venue and fantastic staff that were so helpful and lovely and could not recommend kilashee enough for a stay (especially in the old part of the hotel) and as a venue for an event ",5,2023,11,07
218,Enjoyable night,"I stayed here as part of a business function.  I enjoyed my stay.  The bedroom was spacious and well laid out and the bathroom, although a little dated, was clean and tidy.  The hotel is a little bit of a maze to get around but if you follow the signs, it is not so bad.  I never really used any of the hotel facilities e.g. spa or bar so I am unable to comment on those areas.  The food at the business function was tasty and the staff attentive and I thought everything was organised exceptionally well.  The staff at check in and check out were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was alright although I am not a fan of buffet breakfast meals preferring freshly cooked options.  Based on my experience, I would stay here again if I was in the area.",4,2023,11,06
218,Fantastic hotel,"Lovely hotel, from the staff to the gardens to the walk ways around this hotel. You can not find a nicer spot to stay. The rooms are always lovely and clean. Dinner and breakfast selections are top notch.

We got the hotel package at such a great price and it was more than worth it. The hydrotherapy pool was amazing, so relaxing.

218,Killashee....mixed ,"The best part of the Killashee experience is the old part. The original house and grounds are special. If you could stay in the original house, now that would be a special break. 

The actual rooms though are in a modern extension. The windows are small, heavy curtains, very hot, looking out at a wall of rooms across the way (we were anyway). Exactly the kind of hotel room I wouldn't be bothered leaving home for! 

Back to the main part of the hotel. The dinner was really tasty, the staff were friendly, my older son loved the breakfast buffet. The old grounds are beautiful and just off the bottom of the property we came across an amazing old derelict mansion, stables, round tower, graveyard...all unpreserved and crumbling...sad that things that should be protected are crumbling (I don't think the hotel owns them...not sure though). They were fascinating...

When we arrived for our stay though our younger child was asleep in car so my husband sat in the car with him and the bags. I wandered into reception with our older child and he was very excited to hear our room was ready. We were asked for the credit card and I explained it and everything was in car with sleeping son.  So our room key was withdrawn. That felt grubby...we were potential miscreants that couldn't have access to our rooms until we could get the credit card...so we wandered around in rain until he woke. An unpleasant first impression. 

Swimming pool was small and packed...prob better out of midterm!

",4,2023,11,02
218,Amazing,"Only stayed at this hotel one night wish I could of stayed longer 
Everything at this hotel was perfect and when I come to Ireland again I will definitely be staying here 
But will make sure it is for a longer period ",5,2023,10,29
218,Most relaxing stay ever,From the moment we arrived till we left was the most relaxing break. The staff were so friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere was lovely.  Food was really good.  I would definitely stay again. A much needed break ,5,2023,10,27
218,Nice and fancy,Fabulous hotel and lovely staff. Just a lil disappointed as I mentioned in my booking it was our mini moon as we had only got married the week before and it wasn’t acknowledged at all… only at brekfast in the hotel and that was lovely!! Didn’t get to try the spa as it was fully booked the whole two days we were there but the pool was nice!,4,2023,10,26
218,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel with great staff. Daniel was outstanding. The food was great and the restaurant was so pleasant with gorgeous smile. The room was kept in the best shape and the towels were well arranged,5,2023,10,26
218,Strives for luxury country estate but falls short,"Overall I would describe our stay as disappointing. The grandeur of the common areas quickly fades away & you are left with a very average room, despite staying in an executive suite. The hotel does not have air conditioning so the entire property felt incredibly warm. I don't think I need to explain what happens when staff have to work in increased heat, I will leave that to your imagination. The food in the Pippin Tree is delicious though. Breakfast is the standard offering, albeit the lack of soda and potato bread in an Irish hotel is disappointing. Overall I don't think we would return.",3,2023,10,26
218,Overnight to attend a funeral in the local area,"Amazing value available in the Killashee House Hotel especially for a sophisticated traveller. The lifts system is a little disconcerting at firs but when you get the hang of it, it's part of the package, and you can easily adjust to it.",5,2023,10,22
218,Top Class,"Great experience overall. Hotel facilities and grounds are lovely ,  would highly recommend. Staff and service was excellent. Great dining options, high quality food and a great location for shopping at Kildare village.",5,2023,10,20
218,Frankie,"Very pleasant hotel rooms are lovely and very friendly staff nothing was an issue to anyone 
Excellent gym and training facilities Spa and treatment where first class food in all restaurants was excellent and a good choice available ",5,2023,10,19
218,Mum and daughters Spa Break,The hotel has beautiful bedrooms and reception areas. The Spa was lovely with great professional staff. but the hydrotherapy suite was very poor. One steam room. A  cold shower that takes about 5 pulls of a cord to turn on and then it turns  back hot again before you have a chance to acclimatise. Broken chairs. Very poor Jacuzzi area in the pool with  jets that do nothing . Food was good but not exceptional. ,3,2023,10,17
218,Family Birthday Treat ,"Stayed on a very busy Saturday night and yet the property is so spacious and the service so personal we felt very welcome and exceptionally well looked after.  Our visit was a family birthday celebration and it felt very special from the momentwearrived. Staff were friendly,  professional and courteous.  Paul in the bar was keeping a close eye on service and was very attentive.  Ample staff to handle a busy rugby match yet the surroundings afforded space and comfort if you weren't following the sport. The property is stunning,  that goes without saying but what stood out was the cleanliness of the public areas and bedroom. The fragrance as you enter the property is also noteworthy!! We had an exceptional dining experience in the Restaurant.  The food was excellent and even the children's menu offered something for everyone..point to note here, one child  has a severe nut allergy and this was catered for without any disappointment to the child as in other establishments, I've often had no dessert option but here that wasn't an issue.
Food presentation is really beautiful and well thought out and great choice on the menu. The flavour of every dish was beautiful and our waiter offered an excellent wine recommendation. 
Breakfast was also a delight with a wide variety of options. We had a lovely wander around the fabulous grounds before check out. While all the team members were very impressive we'd like to especially thank Gemma for a wonderful stay. 
",5,2023,10,16
218,Saturday Treat,"Afternoon tea was very good. Food was amazing and so was the staff. Music was nice touch. Also not to forget we were asked for feedback on sandwiches sweets etc which i thought was very nice of him, assuming he is manager. We would definitely be back over christmas ",5,2023,10,15
218,Good Service,"Our stay was very enjoyable. Went for nice walk around this gem of hotel as weather was lovely. Followed by beautiful dinner in pippin restaurant. Really good service and good attention was paid by manager. Thank you for acknowledging special occasion. Finished with few drinks upstairs, atmosphere was brilliant. This is great place to get away for few days without a doubt.",5,2023,10,15
218,Stunning hotel steeped in history with connection to St Patrick,"Beautiful hotel,amazing gardens so peaceful and such a lovely place to relax. Enjoyed fine dining at it's best in the Pippin Tree Restaurant -  amazing history behind this hotel and grounds. Would highly recommend ",5,2023,10,12
218,A great hotel for family trip away,"I never usually leave reviews but I really wanted to this time. I can’t say enough good things about Killashee Hotel, they were so kind and attentive to us and our baby daughter. Nothing was an issue, they made the whole experience completely relaxed which isn’t easy with a small baby!!! Highly recommend for families as it seems to have fantastic resources available for older children! Thanks so much, we will certainly be back! ",5,2023,10,11
218,One of the Best Hotels out there,"Super place to stay, I couldn't recommend Killashee Hotel highly enough. 
The staff were so helpful. Very friendly and always had a smile on there face. The rooms and restaurants were so clean and comfortable ",5,2023,10,11
218,"Professional  friendly staff, Lovely stay","We decided to try Kilashee Hotel after reading the positive reviews. We were apprehensive that we might be among wedding festivities, but this was not the case. The bedroom & spacious bathroom were spotless . 

The bar staff were knowledgeable & super friendly . We dined in the Oak & Anvil on our first evening & in The Pippin Tree on the 2nd evening. We had a glitch with our Vegan meal in the Pippin Tree but the manager Mr Nitin Gautam  was just fantastic & made it right straight away. 

It was refreshing to see this hotel take an interest in training staff properly. 

This was our first visit to Kilashee hotel but we do plan on returning again ",4,2023,10,09

218,Absolute gem close to Dublin,"Our second stay at the Killashee was just as good as we remembered from 2018. Superb venue, lovely rooms and a very relaxed experience.

We will definitely return and would recommend.",5,2023,10,09

We were explained all the lovely treats and really felt special with little touches of plate with macaron for my upcoming trip. Thanks Nitin and team. Highly recommend. Carrot cake with icing was our favourite and lovely light scones. I,5,2023,10,08
218,A delightful stay on business,I attended a conference that is held annually at Killashee. The level of care and professionalism of the staff is excellent. Everything worked smoothly and the hard work behind the scenes by the staff made my stay delightful,5,2023,10,08
218,Down time,"An absolutely lovely place to stay both from the accommodation point of view to the quality of the services. Professional and friendly staff, quality bedrooms and excellent choice of food. The spa is well run and offers a wide range of treatments. ",5,2023,10,04
218,Fantastic hotel,Everything at this hotel was perfect. Fantastic service. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fantastic and also the lunch we had after check-out.. The rooms were fantastic. Well worth the stay for a special occasion.,5,2023,10,03
218,Not a good experience.,"Had lunch in Hotel restaurant with a friend. I ordered a wrap and she had fish.
My wrap was toasted ( did not say this on menu) when it arrived it was burnt, I left most of it. My friends fish was not great either. I complained and was told I would be given a discount… I pointed out that the menu did not state the wrap would be toasted, lady took it into kitchen to show chef. I was then told I would not be charged.
I was asked for my name and phone number, I was told that a manager would contact me. This happened nearly 2 weeks ago. I have not heard from Hotel.
A very bad experience in a lovely Hotel, very disappointing. I would be reluctant to go there again.
My friend is local to Hotel and I was visiting from UK",3,2023,09,30
218,Great stay,We stayed here recently for our anniversary and everything was great. Our room was beautiful. Both dinner and breakfast can’t be faulted. We both had treatments in the spa which were great. We would definitely recommend this hotel! Thank you!,5,2023,09,30
218,A gem of a hotel!,"Beautiful hotel just 40 minutes from the Dublin airport. Lovely building and grounds, delicious food and kind staff. A few negatives, long walk to some of the guest rooms. It felt a little bit like a maze but it’s such a pretty place, you don’t mind that much. We had mostly good service in the dining areas but one of the waiters in the fine dining didn’t seem to understand English very well or know what sides came with the meals. In spite of these few negatives, I highly recommend this lovely hotel! ",5,2023,09,29
218,"Girls trip, very relaxed and wonderful food","We stayed for 2 nights. The room was big with 2 double beds and the highlight was the large tv and dyson hair dryer. The downs were no plug at kettle and had to be moved to use, bed a little hard for me but overall really nice room. 

Spa treatments and relaxation room was fab only let down was the hydro/thermal room the beds were broken and very few of them for ratio of people also no sauna.

Dinner in both the Oak and the Poppin was fabulous. Highlight was the Poppin, it was on the more expensive side for dinner but it was justified with the food and service we received.

Lovely relaxing bar area on the way to the rooms which we relaxed in on both nights. Nice comfy sofas and friendly staff. 

Overall a really enjoyable experienc",4,2023,09,27
218,Unhelpful staff made us feel unwelcome. ,Nice building.  Staff condescending and unhelpful …except the bar staff!  Reception did NOT advise us our room required going up one elevator then down another and our room was at the end of a long corridor very far away from any amenities. We didn’t  make a reservation for the casual pub like restaurant (who does!) and when told it was full we went to the full service a la carte restaurant but we didn’t like the menu. On returning to the casual restaurant it was clear that those with a ‘dinner package’ took precedent and single men were given seats after we waited because they had a ‘reservation’. The attitude was unhelpful by the older female matre d and no attempt was made to provide even a casual table or offer us food at the bar. The deep impression was that we were unimportant because we weren’t part of a corporate clientele or regulars or had been good enough guests to reserve a very casual restaurant table.  Our room was pleasant but the bathroom was old and tired. The grounds are superb but how a guest feels is more important…and we were made to feel like a nuisance. This hotel is fairly isolated so we didn’t get dinner because it was clear we were not going to be accommodated. As we left no apologies were offered. Beautiful lobby….bad service. Except the bar staff. They were lovely. ,2,2023,09,26
218,Perfect,Killashhee was a lovely place to stay. All the facilities were good. The food in pippin tree was excellent and the staff was very polite in the hotel. We really had an excellent time. The gym and swimming pool were excellent. Could not fault anything. ,5,2023,09,21
218,Not what I expected but would definitely go back.,"Looks great when you drive up. The reception area was nothing like I expected. 
It was strange to take the lift up to go to your room and then having to through a bar area to get to another lift to down to our room, that became annoying after a while.
The bar down stairs was nice. Had dinner in the Pippin Tree restaurant and I thought the food and service were top class! 
Even though some things about it were a bit annoying, I would definitely go back.",4,2023,09,20
218,Perfection,"I am absolutely gobsmacked at the few bad reviews on this hotel. The hotel was beautiful, clean, more than comfortable with a lovely vibe. The staff were excellent the food was great and we could not fault the immaculate room. This place is all class ",5,2023,09,20
218,Average,"Rooms, spa treatments, all fantastic. Food choice and quality poor. Dirty tables in the Larkspur Lounge, staff in the bar unhelpful. Breakfast was nice but had to find someone to get tea/coffee. Don't think we would return.",3,2023,09,18
218,Good Break......,"Spacious rooms, Beautiful surroundings. Choice of two restaurants to eat. Lovely food in both of them. Relaxing lounge upstairs. All staff was very hepful polite and manner some. Swimming Pool and gym was excellent too. Thoroughly enjoyed our relaxing break at killashee. Well done to all involved.",5,2023,09,13
218,Enjoyable,The whole stay was very enjoyable from check in to check out. We found the restaurant meal most enjoyable experience. Indian man in suit made our dining extra special experience by explaining every little thing. Thanks to all.,5,2023,09,13
218,"Bad rooms , smelly bar, overall very bad","Bad , had to change rooms after being put in disabled room , noisy fan in bedroom , no soap in second room , bar smells of fish … bad staff …really bad decor … didn’t dare to go to the spa … can’t recommend it",1,2023,09,13
218,Exceptional Weekend Stay,"Just back from a long weekend at this lovely Hotel, this was our 4th time that we have now stayed. We booked the Executive Suite, Room 245, and it was exceptional. A huge bedroom, lovely lounge, great bathroom and even a dressing area too. The food here is always first class and the staff are so helpful and polite.",5,2023,09,12
218,Spa weekend,"Very nice hotel amazing nature around. Spectacular garden. 
We having pampered time in Spa . All treatment, hydrotherapy pool and staff*****, fabulous.
Dinner experience in The Pippin Tree very tasty very recommended.
Rooms was nice very luxury but bed needs renovation very noisy any moving.
Breakfast need better for this style hotel. Not many choices. We was in hotel before and breakfast was amazing but this time not good experience.

Anyway staff was great and very helpful.",3,2023,09,11
218,100 stars out of 10!!,"We held our corporate retreat here for 3 nights and I couldn’t rate this place high enough. The  grounds itself are stunning and the hotel is beautiful after its renovation. The staff here go above and beyond with special mention to Lisa, Greg, Gemma, Sinead and Louise! Superstar team who made our week run so smoothly, no request was too much and if something was not possible they always had different suggestions to offer. Food was great and the bedrooms are fabulous! ",5,2023,09,11
218,Highly Recommend,We had lovely time over few days. Everything was lovely and staff was very attentive. We had food in restaurant few nights n a row and have to say we were impressed by customer service of Nathan as he offered us substitute dishes so we get variety. Alfred Mercie were lovely too and very friendly. We also used swimming pool and again staff was very good n health club. No hesitation in recommending this hotel. Lovely weather to walk outside hotel.,5,2023,09,06
218,Had my wedding here...some ups and downs but would not book here again,"Held my wedding here. Staff on the day were fantastic including Marian and Gareth who went above and beyond.
Wedding coordination in the lead up to the wedding was poor. A request for somewhere for the groom to get ready for half an hour before the ceremony was met with a charge of €250 for a board room! The day for our guests was lovely and everyone seemed to have a great day. Behind the scenes there were a calamity of errors.  No luggage in bridal suite for bride and groom, allocation of rooms a complete disaster,  breakfast to the bridal suite the morning after the wedding never arrived.

Overall the day went fine and the staff on the day were excellent. But I would not recommend this hotel to couples for weddings.  I often hear during wedding speeches the couple thanking their particular hotel and that they went above and beyond. With Killashee it was not the case. Anything we asked was a struggle. It was all extra money and then on the day mistakes were made.",3,2023,09,05
218,Family Break ,"Last trip before the kids went back to school. Stayed in the Killashee House Hotel with the family. Have to say we were most impressed as it had had a major refurbishment since I was last there. We given a lovely large family room which was very comfortable. We ate in the main bar and the food and service was of a high quality. Lots for the kids to do including outdoor playground, football pitch and excellent leisure facilities. Breakfast was very busy but ample choice of hot and cold buffet. Would definitely return again and very close to Kildare Village and the National Stud. ",5,2023,09,04
218,Nice place but poor and expensive food,The hotel itself is nice enough and staff are very nice helpful and friendly but the food is a massive let down. 170 euro for very poor food is not good at all. I ordered a whipped goats cheese salad which was actually just cream and I had to send back. Staff were helpful on this but the rest of the meal was not up to any good standard and I couldn’t recommend staying if you want to enjoy a dinner.,3,2023,09,04
218,High Expectations which we’re disappointed,"The Management know of my feelings as I have made a very full review directly to the Hotel .
I have noted the good work of Cecelia the Duty Manager and the excellent service by Nathan the Manager of Pippin Tree restaurant.
I have made it known that like Humpty Dumpty expectations,when shattered,cannot be put together again.",3,2023,09,03
218,Afternoon Tea-Sunday,Booked here for afternoon Tea. I had to return the cups twice as they were unevenly chipped. Finally after getting a good tea cup our treats arrived. Nicole was very good in explaining all the sandwiches and sweets. Very Polite girl. Also had to recommend Nitein as he apologized for crockery and handled it very professionally. Food was very good especially scones but as a customer we do expect good chinaware as we are paying 40 euros. As promised we would be back hopefully next year when they have good crockery and tea pots in. ,5,2023,08,29
218,Break-Fantastic,"It was a good break. Hotel is lovely, spaciuos rooms, lovely surroundings. All staff was friendly. Food was enjoyable too. We also had afternoon tea spa package, highly recommend as treat. Amazing time",5,2023,08,29
218,Ups & Downs - Good Break,"Recently stayed here and had few ups and downs but overall we were happy. Check in was slow but we guess they were busy. Food in bar was disappointing and no service again as they were busy. Bar upstairs was nice and relaxing. Pippin Tree food was mediocre, didn't really enjoyed soup it was bland and chicken was dry, but it was noted by manager and were impressed that he tried his best to offer another dish. I didn't really go for another dish. He offered us some petit fours which was nice. We did enjoy the spa. Breakfast was good too. Overall for the money we spent we thought it could have been better. Happy enough with customer service.",5,2023,08,28
218,Time away,Booked with kilashhee hotel for 2 nights. Checked in got out room and it was lovely. However the room we had been given has only a bath and no shower enclosure. As I had a total knee replacement I couldn't climb into a bath so the wonderful girl Rebecca on reception kindly upgraded our room when we went back to reception to see if we could have a room with a shower. All upgraded and moved to a gorgeous superior room with shower enclosure and bath !!! Nothing was a bother and they were so kind and helpful. Hard to find such kindness these days. Thank you to kilashee hotel for making this a very enjoyable stay. Highly recommend....,5,2023,08,28
218,Good Hotel,"We had a lovely time. Swimming pool and gym facility are heaven. Food in restaurant was excellent, staff was kind, they ran out of dessert but manager offered me any dessert from other menu. Appreciate the kindness. Find our room was a bit tricky. Enjoyed our walks around hotel. Had a lovely time",5,2023,08,28
218,The hotel break you need.,"Great hotel set in beautiful garden and surroundings. All the staff,  at reception, dining rooms and domestic were very friendly and helpful.  There was a terrific array of food for breakfast and dinner in The Pippin Tree Restaurant was special. The hotel is very convenient  for visiting The National Stud and Japanese Gardens and Kildare Village and they provide a printed leaflet of all lical amenities.
If you intend to use the spa facilities,  book as soon as you can because it can get booked out quickly if there's a wedding at hotel. They are a hotel known for great family packages, so be aware that there will be some children around. Having said that, children's entertainment area is apart and not in your face and any children we encountered  were great. Would gladly stay at thís hotel again and would recommend it highly.",5,2023,08,28
218,"Hotel needs upgrading, gardens beautiful ","The grounds are beautiful, car parking plentiful.

The hotel itself needs some TLC, needs updating and refurbishment. 

Layout was confusing, having to access bedrooms through a lounge public area is bizarre for a 5 star, more like a 2/3 star.

Bedrooms very hot and looking grubby for a 5 star hotel.

Food nothing special was lukewarm.

Disappointed as I had was at a family wedding.
Area for wedding needs to be segrated from general guests.

It's definitely not a hotel I would recommend.

Staff very helpful and lovely.",4,2023,08,28
218,Great,"Could not fault it at all, great hotel great entertainer/singer in the upstairs bar.food was fab in both restaurant and bar. The spa was gorgeous and the Staff couldn't do enough for us. Very quick check out!",5,2023,08,28
218,I would highly recommend Kilashee Hotel,"We had a wonderful visit to Kilashee for our anniversary, the hotel itself is beautifully decorated & designed with stunning grounds. It was our anniversary & there was a card with some sweets left waiting for us in our room when we arrived. One particular staff member, her name was Tanya, went out of her way on the phone to make sure our stay was extra special. The Spa is also really well designed & the staff are super friendly & professional there. The food was also yummy! We will definitely be back. Thank you! ",5,2023,08,24
218,Short family stay,"Great location, friendly staff. A lot to do for kids age 7, 5,4…..just didn’t have the time to experience everything. Such spacious family room, fabulous facilities , pool , gym, kids room and a delicious breakfast to start the day ",5,2023,08,22
218,Lovely couples get away,"My husband and I had a wonderful two night stay in The Bell Tower. Great escape from the reality of life, a beautiful room. 
The leisure center is very spacious and well equipped. 
The spa was nice and we enjoyed the couples mud treatment.
Food was good.
Enjoyed walking the gardens.",5,2023,08,22
218,Excellent Staff and Pippen Tree - Undid by a lack of Air Conditioning,"We (my Wife and Daughter) stayed here from August 16th to the 18th.  We live close enough to the location, so the trip was more of a quick break to relax and enjoy our couple of days away from it all.  
The hotel is nice, the gardens are great and they offer a good variety of activities for kids (special mention to Cormac for entertaining a 4 year old who was the only one to show up to the soccer event!).  The pool facilities are decent and my wife assures me that the Spa was excellent.
The meals were however a little hit and miss.. the Pippen Tree in the evening was excellent, but the lunch in the bar was below poor.  The breakfast was a little chaotic (which can happen at peak times) but there is no excuse for stale cereal or cleanliness in the buffet area.
I would probably give it a second chance based on the Pippen Tree or the relaxed upstairs bar, but the heat in the rooms with no air conditioning was sub-standard.  The cleaning staff did their best after the first night and gave us an extra fan, however, this was not enough to combat the heat.. a night in which we only managed to get 1 hour of sleep due to the temperature.  On check-out we did say it to the receptionist who asked if we would like to discuss it with a manager - however, at this point, we were all too tired to stay any longer as we wanted to go home and catch up on some sleep.   We went for a nice relaxing break, which we had in good chunks.. but to leave sleepless undid all of the good that we had experienced, in chunks. ",3,2023,08,22
218,"Old tired needs renovation ,","If you looking for a night or 2 away in a luxury hotel this is not it .it’s more like 3 star , bedrooms and bathrooms old tired and grubby , rooms very hot , food nothing to get to excited about , it’s a a wedding factory sort of hotel , reminds me of city west .",2,2023,08,22
218,Fabulous Hotel,"Great breakfast, fab lunch and gorgeous dinner. Excellent location, 5 minutes from Nass town and about 12 minutes to Kildare Village. Fabulous entrance and surrounding gardens, lovely walks and great for children. ",5,2023,08,21
218,Family Fun,"Family friendly destination. Every part of hotel was enjoyable, restaurant bar lounge pool and walk around the hotel. Amazing setting. Kids were busy, plenty to do. All staff was very kind and attentive. Great show guys....We had a lovely time. ",5,2023,08,17
218,Fabulous stay,Amazing hotel such a luxury a lot of kids tho for such a beautiful tranquil spot . Great facilities all round and gorgeous walks the food is fabulous and lots to offer too . All staff went above and beyond,5,2023,08,17
218,Highly Recommend,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Killashee, Everything was good here, staff food service walks around the garden. Nittin made our dining extra special by explaining all dishes and as we dined again we were offered other menu which we really appreciated. Food was delicious and nothing was too much for staff. One of the best experiences and highly recommend stay here. Girl at reception was very polite too, cant remember her name. ",5,2023,08,17
218,Beautiful hotel,Nicely decorated and clean hotel. The hotel had a reasonable choice of gluten free options. Nespresso maker in the bedrooms was a welcome treat. Comfortable rooms which were quiet at night. Beautiful gardens and outdoor seating ,5,2023,08,16
218,Very enjoyable family stay,"Had a really enjoyable two night stay.
Nice vibe there with plenty of guests but yet it still had a relax feel.
The staff were 10 out of 10. Really friendly and helpful.
Very flexible in The Pippin Tree to give our two year old the Rice Crispies she wanted as her starter before she enjoyed her Pasta. That put Mama & Dad at ease.

Very good knowledge by the staff of Gluten Free and plenty of options.

Great hotel for kids. Only suggestion I’d have to improve, was in the playground. There were no ramps for kids to climb up to the slide.

In summary, would definitely recommend this hotel for an enjoyable family break.",5,2023,08,16
218,Relaxing night away ,"Found myself in Naas for work on a weekend and thought why not make a night of it and bring my other half! Quickly finished up work so we could soak up the sun sitting outside in the hotels beautiful gardens. quiet and calming atmosphere to relax have lunch, a few drinks and catch up! Our room was lovely and spacious although there was no air con we kindly got dropped up a fan that definitely helped with the hot weather at the time. went for dinner in the hotel our waiter was great and ever so accomodating with any requests. We didn't make it to the pool this time but will defo look into it when we go back!",5,2023,08,16
218,Fabulous Stay,Fabulous spacious hotel with lots of things to do for families.  Food excellent and staff very friendly and efficient.  Lovely spa and therapy pool. Lots of areas to sit and chill.  Nice outdoor spaces for children.,5,2023,08,16
218,Fabulous Family Experience ,"We are back from a great stay at the Killashee House Hotel. It is a really fancy which really caters well for kids, this is usually hard to get both.Fabulous grounds,walks,gardens,playground,playroom,leisure centre and spa.Great time had by all.",5,2023,08,15
218,Wedding guest,"Fabulous hotel , but definitely make sure you bring your hiking boots to get to your bedroom . I got lost loads of times it was so confusing . You have to go up in the lift, on a little trek ,and then down a floor to get your bedroom 🫣 the toilet from the wedding room was also a hike , definitely not good for elderly people . But apart from that all was good ",4,2023,08,15
218,Weekend break,"This hotel was absolutely fantastic, friendly staff, hotel was stunning. The gardens were immaculate with lovely walks and a nice place to walk off the  great food. Lively music in the lounge upstairs. The spa was amazing as were the staff there. Id recommend the Rasul experience We will be back again",5,2023,08,15
218,Not happy with bar service,Food was OK. Got steak for €40 but not worth it. Kids food was decent. Staff had lack of manners. Threw the bill onto the table without any acknowledgement. No thank you or anything. Unfortunately would have no interest going back to the restaurant again.,2,2023,08,13
218,Happy Us,"Reception- All Good. Bar- Decent. Bar Food- slight disappointing. Lounge- Nice Treats. Spa- Very Good. Pippin Tree- Very Good. Staff was very helpful and welcoming. Food in restaurant was good, fine dining style and very good service to match. Really happy that we used spa t was amazing too. ",5,2023,08,13

218,Really lovely relaxing stay,"A really lovely hotel. Very family friendly with excellent staff. Spacious rooms & very comfy beds.  

Tea / coffee & scones in the lounge is a lovely relaxing experience.

218,family break,"Its a family heaven for sure, so many options for kids, just made our break so enjoyable and kids loved it too. All staff who interacted with us were very helpful and polite.

218,Fab Stay,"Fabulous stay. Hotel is neat and clean, spacious rooms, beauitiful outside areas if no rain... Food was excellent in pippin tree as part of package. Nathan and Alfred were very professional, Also Louise at reception was very helpful. Overall service was excellent in most of the part of hotels. Used spa too, excellent facility. We didnt enjoy the cocktails that much, stuck to wine. ",5,2023,08,10
218,Overnight stay with friends,"We stayed last night and had Dinner .. it was fabulous from start to finish.  We got an upgrade and it was a fabulous room.  We will be back and tks to Manager Ger Alley and all the friendly staff
Bernie White",5,2023,08,10
218,Overnight Stay,"We can not thank Ger & All The Staff enough for the fantastic service it was a 100%.  It was second to none.  The food was amazing.  Highly recommend it.  We will definitely be back 
Ber, Clare & Marjorie ",5,2023,08,10
218,Disappointed,"On arrival to the hotel, the drive and entrance are spectacular, the surroundings are beautiful. On check in we’re we’re delighted to receive an upgrade to a suite. After climbing numerous step, we entered a beautiful suite. One of the main disappointing things was not being able to open the bedroom window due to being nailed shut, very warm and stuffy, although a small fan is provided. The bathroom included a beautiful claw bath, however, no extra bottles of bath foam as the shower and hand wash are bottles attached to the wall. How do you get the bath/ shower foam into the shower? No flannel, and poor towels. One roll of toilet paper! 
We booked dinner in the restaurant, large room / hall, where also breakfast is served. Breakfast is a buffet, which is also disappointing, food wasn’t great, surroundings were kept clean, orange juice spilled, beans messed around, had to ask for more sausages. My partner asked for an omelette, which was 20-25 minutes late coming out. I was finished breakfast, and we had to ask for his omelette, which also wasn’t great. 
Some building work was being completed upstairs, perfectly acceptable, however the stairs was unclean, due to the building work, just needed to be vacuumed more frequently. 
Quite busy, many children, noisy environments, expensive for what you get. Over all, nothing special. 
We had great expectations, however, left feeling disappointed and won’t be returning.",3,2023,08,10
218,Family Hotel,"Great hotel for families. Good sized pool, play areas. Friendly efficient staff, good food and drink. Hotel has no air conditioning however and the rooms were extremely warm despite the fan being on. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay.",5,2023,08,10
218,Would not return - Dissapointed,"This hotel is trying very hard to be a high class, 4* / 5* hotel and at the outset it seems that way. However there is far better quality accommodation and service in other hotels in the same price bracket. 
It is a good location & the rooms were very clean.
Service, Value, Sleep Quality were very disappointing.",2,2023,08,09
218,Amazing staff,"Had a lovely meal in there last Wednesday, our waitress Keeley couldn’t have done enough for us. Food was excellent and the staff are great. Would highly recommend. Good job to the staff and well done Keeley. ",4,2023,08,08
218,Needs work to be done with staff and food. Over priced at present!,"Staff need more training and the chef needs to sharpen up on the menu. Staff were friendly but often found unsure if many things. Drinks not in stock on multiple options. More atmosphere needed in the Pippin Tree, it's like eating in a Barracks!!",2,2023,08,08
218,Wedding stay,"We stayed at The Kilashee Hotel for a friend's wedding. It was brilliant from start to finish. Food was amazing, room's were fab and service was great. Would highly recommend this hotel for a family stay or wedding",5,2023,08,07
218,Beautiful hotel with very warm rooms!,"This hotel is a lovely spot for a family stay. The gardens are absolutely beautiful and the added playground is such a bonus (although very little for our young toddler to use). 

On our arrival evening, there was no availability in the bar for dining (our fault for not pre-booking, we just assumed the bar would have walk in availability). The staff kindly brought food to the room for us instead. The menu in the bar is nice but limited enough, would benefit from just one or two more choices on the menu. On saying that, everything we ate was lovely and the staff were very helpful. 

The breakfast staff were all lovely also and very welcoming, especially the meet and greet ladies at the door. The food was nice and there was plenty of it. 

The rooms are big and spacious with nice comfy beds. The bathrooms are quite dated in my opinion and would definitely benefit from a revamp. The taps were either roasting hot or too cold (no mixer so that was annoying). 

My main complaint about our 2 night stay was the heat in the room. We had a monitor for our baby that has a very accurate temperature gauge on it and both nights the room was sitting at 26/27 degrees even with the window open all night which was very uncomfortable for sleeping. There is no temperature adjustment in the room and no air conditioning. The receptionist advised us that the walls of the hotel were pumped last year and the rooms remain at these temperatures now even without heating on. Despite all the positives about this hotel, this would put me off returning until some air conditioning is installed (never thought that would be a complaint in Ireland!). There is also only a heavy duvet on the beds. I would advise maybe adding an extra top sheet for those who find the duvet too warm. We had to sleep with no blankets/sheets! 

Otherwise though, a lovely stay and perfect if you’re able to sleep in very warm temperatures!",4,2023,08,04
218,Just OK," Room was fine. Bathroom was awful. Shower ran hot to cold to hot during 5 to 10 minute shower. No flannel or slip mat in bath/shower. Staff were fine. Food and service in Oak and Anvil was really good but food and service in the Pippen Tree (part of deal) was below average. 
While trying to relax in bar areas on both evenings, young kids, who have no business being in a bar after 9pm (I thought this was law) are let run around screaming and shouting unsupervised, up to 11pm on one evening. I wasn't the only person who remarked on it. Staff didn't seem to be bothered. 
The pool is obviously open to the public. Very hard to have a relaxing swim when you have people coming in obviously training for ""whatever"" taking over the lanes for hours at a time. The pool is in a seperate building which isn't mentioned on the hotel website. 
I had high expectations for this hotel. Very ""family"" oriented, which is fine but not at the expense of other customers experiences. Won't be back based on this visit. ",3,2023,08,04
218,Kilashee Hotel Breakaway,"We recently had a very enjoyable and relaxing break in the very impressive Killashee Hotel in Naas. It has plenty of beautiful gardens and outdoor areas to enjoy (a big shout out to the gardeners who have done a magnificent job). The staff were most welcoming and friendly and made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay perfect.  We dined on the first evening in the Oak and Anvil, the food was delicious, a great choice on the menu. The second evening we dined in the Pippin Tree restaurant, the food was sumptuous, great attentive service in both areas. The interior areas, including the reception area, have a charming  cosy atmosphere. We enjoyed an upgrade so our room also had a sitting room and it was very relaxing and comfortable. I would definitely recommend a breakaway to the Kilashee Hotel.",5,2023,08,04
218,Not suitable for couples looking for a relaxing stay,"I stayed here on Sunday 30th July. It was supposed to be a relaxing night away with my partner. 
The check-in was exceptionally slow. There was a queue longer than I've seen in any hotel and it moved very slowly.
Some communal areas were cold. All were full of kids, so much so that even the thought of going to the leisure centre was off-putting to the point where we retreated to our room for most of the evening, which was cold, and the radiators turned off centrally.
The trip from reception to the room was laborious; up a lift, along a corridor, down another lift, along another corridor. 
The service in The Pippin Tree restaurant was slow and unprofessional. The menu was limited. The only vegan option was a lazy and unimaginative pasta in tomato sauce. IMHO the food I had earlier in the Oak & Anvil was better.
This is a beautiful hotel, with comfortable well decorated rooms and communal areas and lots of facilities if you're happy to share them with lots of other peoples children. I attended a wedding here years ago and a dinner with family more recently and it was great back then. However it seems to have changed its target market to families and the experience for couples has suffered. I would not return nor would I recommend it to any couple looking for a relaxing break away.",3,2023,08,02
218,Weekend Treat,"Had a fabulous weekend. Rooms are very spacious and location is great. If you dont feel like leaving hotel plenty of garden if not raining and town is close by too. Breakfast great selection and lovely coffee. Food in pippin tree was very up class dining and to complement the service was excellent from manager, Cant remember his name. Our wines were topped up we were shocked as it does not happen much in restaurant. Even though place was so busy we enjoyed our evening as nothing was rushed and we relaxed. Very professional service. Highly recommend killashee for a break from city.",5,2023,08,02
218,***** Stars,When we go out now a days we do not get enough service as places are really busy but we have to say service in this hotel was absolutely lovely and very attentive. Reception girls were very good. Grounds around hotel are absolutely fantastic. Restaurant food was divine and we were well looked after by Nitan. He served us dinner and breakfast and always kept checking over our stay at hotel. We both agreed the commitment levels were very good in this place. Look forward to visit again in our next break,5,2023,08,02
218,Average at best,"TLDR; The hotel is nice but for a 4 star hotel, I expected more.
The spa is nice but the reception area needs to be more relaxing. It felt like a kitchen. The experience however, was great!

My wife and I went for 2 nights for a wedding Friday and Saturday) . I had a massage on Saturday morning. 

The place is quite beautiful and the wedding was fantastic. They put a lot of resources into the wedding areas and honestly, it was fantastic!
The beds, pillows and duvets were amazing. I can honestly say it was one of the most comfortable stays I'd had in a hotel.
The spa treatment was let down only by the reception area. Once you're checked in, you wait in an area that feels like it wasn't designed to be a spa waiting area. There was a kitchen with a laptop that seemed to be playing music. There was a dishwasher whirring away and I genuinely thought I was in the wrong place, as did another couple that was waiting alongside me. The chairs were like a cafe and that's kinda the feel it had.
Let me go on by saying the spa treatment was amazing! I had a full body Sweedinsh massage and the massuese was absolutely brilliant. The pressure was just right and the room was a nice temperature.

There was no AC in the rooms. This may be trivial in Ireland but it was a cool night when we stayed and with the window open, it felt quite warm. I can't say for sure but I'd imagine on a hot night, it would be very warm.
We checked in on a Friday and there was one person on check in. My card wasn't working due to my bank flagging a dodgy transaction so we got delayed and had to use my wife's card. I could hear people queuing up, getting impatient as there was nobody else there.

We went to the Oak and Anvil for food on Friday and the food was only OK. I had a Katsu chicken burger and it was quite overcooked. I didn't complain because it was after 8 and they told me the kitchen closed at 9. I also hadn't eaten, so I wasn't bothered complaining so I take that on the chin. I must say that the staff were very attentive and the service was great.

The spa and hotel are not connected, so you'll need footwear to get there. They should really look at putting in a canopy to get from the hotel to the spa. I only had dress shoes and didn't want to walk over in shorts and shoes so opted for the slippers provided. The problem is it rained while I was in so when I came back out, my feet were ringing wet from the walk back to the hotel. Not great after a nice relaxing treatment. There was also no robes in the room which I have never experienced in a spa hotel. The robes provided in the spa were tired and could do with replacing. Again, this is the only time I've put a robe on in a spa and it felt like an old towel. C'mon Kilashee, for 4 stars, you should do better!

Would I return? I'm not sure to be honest! The small things were missing from a spa hotel IMO. If they corrected some of the points above, I would definitely consider it but as it is now, I think it's a bit underwhelming.",3,2023,07,31
218,Excellent hotel,"great hotel, on beautiful ground, spa is amazing and always kept clean. food and rooms are lovely, but the staff is next level they go above and beyond for you. the only thing was this time we were in the old part of the hotel and found some noise each morning around 7am",5,2023,07,31

218,Family friendly fun filled weekend,We had an amazing trip from start to finish. We booked a 2 nights stay for my husbands birthday and decided to bring the 2 kids. I wasn’t expecting the hotel to be as family friendly as it was. The kids were thrilled with the welcome packs in our room on arrival. The amenities are ideal. There is a great swimming pool and the kids really enjoy the music during the aqua aerobics class that was on while we were in the children’s pool. We had dinner both nights in the oak and anvil the menu had lots of lovely options to choose from for adults and children’s and each night was ended perfectly with a children’s movie screening just off the bar set up with popcorn and juice. The kids were in their element and are already asking to go back!! ,5,2023,07,17
218,Excellent from beginning to end….. would highly recommend.,"My husband and I stayed in the Killashee last Sat night. It was our 3rd time to visit the hotel but the first visit  since the hotel was taken over by FBD. 

We couldn’t believe the transformation! As well as the beautiful  refurbishment of the hotel which gives the hotel a very elegant yet comfortable / relaxed feel, the staff were very friendly and professional in all areas of the hotel. 

The food was really good in the restaurant both at dinner and again at breakfast. We went for breakfast at 9:30 on Sun morning and the restaurant was very busy and bustling so it was a lovely treat to be offered breakfast in the bar lounge instead.

We didn’t bring our kids on this occasion but there were plenty of  children there and there seemed to be  lots for them to do. Despite the number of children around the place, the spacious public areas and lounges meant there was plenty of quieter areas to retire too if desired, but to be honest we weren’t at all disturbed by the younger guests. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to our next trip.. and we might even bring the kids! ",5,2023,07,17
218,Family holiday,"Lovely hotel with fantastic facilities and grounds for kids and adults.

He was so positive and nothing seemed and issue for him , still there that evening when we returned from races with huge simile on face to welcome us with our horse wins/losses

218,A perfect 2 night Family break,"A wonderful two night stay with our family. This is our second time staying in Killashee and it didn’t disappoint. The hotel, restaurants and rooms are beautiful. The Oak & Anvil restaurant had a great selection to choose from and best suited our families tastes. Nicole who welcomed us at breakfast both mornings is so lovely and her service stood out along with Orla at reception who spent time speaking with my kids. The pool is open for family swim with the bonus of not having to book slots just turn up and stay as long as you like.  There was great kids play room just past the larkspur Lounge and at 7pm each night kids club had a movie on which is on the lounge meaning the kids could watch the movie and come in and out as they pleased, the hotel also provided some juice and popcorn for the movie which my daughter was delighted with. The gardens are spectacular and of course the kids enjoyed the play park.  Plenty to do in the hotel, with family games for everyone to play in the lounge, daily activities and not to forget the amazing icecream station and coffee shop just off reception leading out to the grounds and the beautiful Butterfly garden.  Killashee has firmly held its place in our annual family trip to Dublin. ",5,2023,07,14
218,Perfect!!,"Would highly recommend this hotel for a family break. The hotel is amazing, spotless, the smell everything looks new. 
The food 5 star, the atmosphere from the moment you walk in is something else. Nothing is too much hassle for the staff, especially Barry, Justin , lovely girl on the restaurant reception & night staff at the upstairs bar area. 

The attention to kids, kids playrooms, cinema room, staff even bringing popcorn and drinks to children in the play area. 

Rooms beautiful 
Swimming pool class
Beautiful gym & spa area. 
Parks , zip lines garden areas picnic benches/ stunning!

218,Family Weekend Away,"This was our second stay at Killashee Hotel after visiting last year to attend a wedding. I cannot express enough how impressed I was with the level of customer service provided by the restaurant staff. We were greeted with a warm welcome from Nicole at breakfast who was very professional and made sure we were all looked after. There was a wide variety at the buffet which was great. We dined in the other restaurant for dinner, the Oak and Anvil. Again we were blown away by the attentiveness of the staff. We were served by Katie who was very friendly and made great recommendations from the menu. The food was top class.

We dined in the Oak & Anvil and the service was second to none. We were sat at the bar while waiting for our table and the lady behind the bar wearing a suit (I can’t remember her name) was lovely and made us some beautiful cocktails. When we were brought to our table, we were served by Jose who was lovely! I have certain allergies and he had no hesitation in double checking everything with the chefs. Jose constantly checked on us throughout our meal which made it that extra personal, so a big thank you to Jose, the lady behind the bar and all the staff in killashee for a wonderful experience ",5,2023,07,09

218,The perfect hotel!,"From start to finish, an amazing stay! The Hotel is stunning both the grounds and the building. The staff were friendly and enthusiastic. We dined in oak and anvil .

Breakfast was again delicious with the staff there being pleasant and attentive. over all the hotel is fantastic and the staff is a true credit. Can't wait for my next visit at killashee!!",5,2023,07,05

218,More then fantastic,"Arriving at the hotel, staff will greet you with a smile. In particular Megan, who checked us in. After checking in we went up to our room and Wow! The room was perfectly clean and well maintained. 

Afterwards we went up for a drink in the lounge, on our way we met Graig. He gave us some more information about the hotel and grounds, so helpful. Arriving at the lounge, we ordered some cocktails with Keith. You won't be disappointed, they were delicious!

Time for our dinner, which we had with some friends in the bar. And again the wow factor is coming in place. Claire welcomed us and she was just amazing. So friendly! 

The food in the bar, is just gorgeous  and well presented from start to finish! 
After a visit in the bar we went up to the lounge again, where live music was playing. And the bar man, Gabriel, was the best man you could get for the job, a real professional.

I also like to mention Paul, who checked on us numerous times, in the bar and the Lounge. He was pleasant and knew exactly how to look after his guests! 

The grounds of the hotel where just beautiful and well looked after! Walking around the gardens give you a real feeling of freedom. A real place to completely relax. 

Of course we also got breakfast, which was hosted by Nicole. You could see, she enjoyed the time with her guests. She made sure we, everybody at breakfast, was well looked after! And of course I could not forget about Sinead, brilliant lady. Gem for the Killashee!

All by all, well done Killashee team. Keep the work up and in the future I will return!",5,2023,07,04
218,Surprise birthday stay for my daughter,"We decided to surprise my daughter with a night away for her 12th birthday and the Killashee didn't disappoint. The manager had a personalised card and chocolates in our room on arrival for my daughter and she was so delighted with it. The say was a real treat for us all and we thoroughly made the most of the swimming pool and enjoyed all our meals at the hotel. My daughter is coeliac but the hotel had lots of gluten free options for her to choose from, especially at breakfast where there was a special gluten free section for her to select from.

218,Great hotel and lovely staff,"Lovely stay for overnight spa break. Staff lovely, hotel and grounds beautiful with a woodland kids playground and interesting walks to be had on the grounds. Spa thermal suits could use an update as quite small and dated compared to others we attended and some buttons in pool not working.

Few small things would make it perfect but in no way would deter the 5/5 rating. ",5,2023,06,25
218,Higgledy Piggledy Average Establishment ,"We chose Kilashee for our annual meet up, having read many 5 star reviews. We had very high expectations but it really was just an average hotel. 
The pool and leisure centre was across a carpark from the main hotel- not ideal. 
The layout of the whole hotel was the most mixed up I'd ever been in. We had to walk through a wedding drinks reception to get to our room.
The young staff could definitely do with some basic training in manners. There were very few smiles or pleasantries. 
Also, the guy in the cocktail bar was charging an extra €0.50 per cocktail. When queried, he shrugged and moved on to the next customer. 
We just felt the whole experience was limp and lacked a bit of life. 
The lunch menu in Oak and Anvil was the same as the evening menu. 
We won't be returning.

Such a grand building, beautiful grounds, lovely breakfast buffet and very friendly staff. The space really harkens back to a different era when hotels were not cookie-cutter and service was personal, warm and friendly. One thing to note is lack of air conditioning. Both visits we asked for a fan and the cool Irish evening air chilled the room sufficiently for a nice night of sleep.",5,2023,06,05
218,Brilliant Hotel-Lovely Staff,"Impressive property and extremely quiet setting not far from most activities we wanted to do in the east of the country. The room was well appointed with real wood furniture. Clean and comfortable throughout. 
Comfortable bed, excellent pillows. 
The walk from reception to our room seemed long but well worth it. 
We will return ",5,2023,06,05
218,Such potential.but disappointing service,The grounds and entrance are lovely. The rooms are very spacious and with appropriate furniture. But the service throughout is one of the worst Inhave received. 35 minute wait for starters when it wasnt even that busy. Rude waiters. Management not following up. No question of how your stay was at reception. Very disappointed ,2,2023,06,04
218,Could have been better!,Lovely hotel setting with fabulous grounds. Whole hotel experience could have been better. Excellent breakfast in terms of quality and variety. Food in Oak and Anvil very good but service was slow. Rooms in need of updating - cracked sink and loose tiles in bathroom and bedroom decor a bit dated. Most staff were not very welcoming/pleasant - definite room for improvement here!!,3,2023,05,31
218,Mixed review,"First class hotel with all the facilities I needed. The bistro service was very poor on the night I ate there so use restaraunt instead,  in all other aspects good value for  money.  Would stay again if in the area.",4,2023,05,29
218,Thank You Killashee...Truly Magnificent.,"Killashee House Hotel is simply magnificent. From the moment we arrived, the grounds of the hotel are stunning and the beautiful suite we stayed in was really lovely.  We were blown away by the elegance and comfort of this truly beautiful hotel.  A real gem.  Food was amazing, staff very friendly and helpful.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on our stay too.  Management take a bow !",5,2023,05,26
218,This should of been a 5 star review,"The spa, the hotel decor, the room , the grounds were all top notch but our dining experience was well below par as our mains was completely forgotten about.

We had to ask twice for an update ( the first sever never came back to us) then we’d to ask for a manager , we waited over 60 mins for the mains - no one came to check on us at all , then when the mains came out - we’d to chase for a steak knife , the veg and the extra side .

It was a very poor experience.",3,2023,05,21
218,Spa was disappointing!,"The hotel experience was beautiful and beyond 😍 Amazing food,beautiful views.
Disappointed with spa. Very unexperienced staff,didn't feel welcome or looked after. 
We arrived with small delay (10-15mins),the girl showing us where to go was talking so quiet that I could barely understand what she's saying. No one would asked you how your trip was or have you ever been here. 3 girls passed us by while we were filling out the paper work and no-one said hello. Treatment wasn't fully explained. Nowhere to leave your clothing.  After the treatment we had to change in the relaxation room which was very uncomfortable. As much as we loved the hotel experience, this put us off as this was the beginning of our day and our stay there. 
Disappointed!",3,2023,05,21
218,Killashee Hotel - a killer stay,excellent hotel siuated not to far from Dublin and was ideal for an overnight stay during my travel from Cork to Dublin - situated just 34 Km from Temple Bar so an easy trip into Dublin for me the next day,5,2023,05,21
218,The perfect stay !,"The pictures didn’t do the property justice ! When we arrived it took our breath away, the staff were so welcoming & we brought our 1 & a half year old swimming & he LOVED the pool & spent most of our time there ! We loved the walk around the property & all the different things to do we weren’t bored. The dinner & breakfast was out of this world, the best of the best. The room was amazing with great facilities, a coffee maker & even a Dyson hairdryer ! Would highly recommend it for a family trip or even a couples trip. Just amazing & relaxing time",5,2023,05,18
218,A perfect stay for a special occasion.,We stayed here for a birthday night away and I couldn't recommend it enough for a special occasion. The setting of the hotel and grounds are amazing. We had a brilliant dinner in the Pippin Tree and the staff all over the hotel couldn't be more helpful.,5,2023,05,15
218,Revisit a year on,"Last year we stayed at the Killashee for a wedding.This time it was a  first communion lunch,I was interested to see any changes the owners had made especially for disabled toilet facilities and surprise ,surprise, None. The disabled  toilets are incorporated in the Ladies and Gents toilets, a cubicle in the gents facing on to a row of urinals which would cause offence to a lady in a wheelchair who would be taken into the toilet by her husband/partner due to this place having no separate toilet for disabled people. This would not be allowed in the North of Ireland, you must have a separate disabled toilet here, even pubs must comply with this. That being said the food was excellent, again one point the staff in the hall didn't serve drinks to the tables, you had to go to the bar for your own drinks, again the same poor service when I was here a year ago.Do you not have a food and beverage manager at functions.They would need need to learn about upsales,You are a four star hotel but sadly not when bar service comes into play.",4,2023,05,15
218,Great deal in a great place.,"Had a wonderful 3 night stay. Rooms are spacious, clean & comfortable, good TV media & Elemis soaps etc. Food was great, wines lovely and a good selection of drinks from the bar. The staff are very friendly and always willing to help.",5,2023,05,14
218,Wonderful experience,This place is beautiful!  Our room was clean with a comfortable bed.  The grounds are exceptional as was all the staff we encountered.  The bartender at The Larkspur Lounge was a character and we enjoyed chatting with him.  Breakfast was delicious and the pastries have ruined me. If you have the chance… go here.  That’s all.,5,2023,05,11
218,"Used to be something, now it's not","Without going into too much detail, the hotel is letting in too many people, with too few staff. Service was atrocious (50 mins waiting on main course), breakfast room service was non existent, and the room was too warm (no a/c). Until they get more trained staff in (which they probably won't) as they cram as many guests in as they can and the staff are overwhelmed and can work elsewhere",1,2023,05,10
218,Ideal family break,"Very accomodating for baby and toddler with excellent food, service, facilities and grounds. Ideal location for range of activities in Kildare and proximity to Dublin too.Great to have pool and kids pool on site also.",5,2023,05,08
218,One night stay.,"Beautiful grounds and well appointed furnishings. Staff were friendly & helpful. Our 2nd floor room was a bit of a walk from reception, due to hotel layout we needed to take 2 elevators. About 50 minutes to the Dublin Airport, taxi was 87 Euro for 4 people.",5,2023,05,07
218,Still amazing hotel on my second visit ,"Stayed at Killashee hotel two weeks ago for the night .
Still just as good and lovely hotel the second time around .
From start to finish we could not fault a thing.
Bedroom was lovely and spacious and very clean .
We dined in Pippin tree restaurant on the Sunday evening and the food was mouth watering , service was top class with lovely friendly staff .
Cocktails in the bar that night was fab. 
Next morning we went down for Breakfast and Nicole the breakfast manager was very friendly and polite .
After breakfast we went for a walk around the beautiful grounds and lovely walk ways around the hotel .
Then the Hydrotherapy pool is one of the best ever and a MUST GO TO , did not want to leave it . 
Went for lunch into the main bar after the spa and again the food was delicious .
Thank you so much to all the staff for a great stay , especially to Gemma , the duty manager and , Ger & Struan the managers , keep up the great work and looking forward to returning very soon . 
J.P & Keith ",5,2023,05,07
218,"Lovely couples night away, friendly staff.","Pity about the construction noise early next morning. And the taps in our bathroom sink not working. 

Spa and leisure separate building, didn't bother us but nice to know. It is stated on the website, something I  didn't take notice of.
Food, drink, location & staff...excellent!",4,2023,05,07
218,Kilashee bit disappointing,"Massive queue at check in, initial room not up to what I expected tear in carpet, invalid bathroom with chair in shower and bumper back on toilet not very romantic, great if handicapped but not to enticing otherwise  asked to be moved and was given a much nicer room.  Leisure center full with kids and lots of club membership locals.",2,2023,05,04
218,Short family break,"A short family break to a lovely hotel. Lovely gardens and playground (mind the crows!), beautiful interior and so clean. The pool area is great with lots of space. 
All staff were friendly but a special mention to Clare (Oak & Anvil), Nicole (breakfast Pippin Tree) and although I didn’t get her name a lovely person at check out (Man U fan).",5,2023,05,04
218,Relaxing getaway,"Beautiful hotel and grounds but friendliness and helpfulness of staff really made our stay.  Convienent base for Kildare Village, Irish National Stud etc.   Will definitely return and would recommend if visiting Ireland",5,2023,05,04
218,Stunning hotel,"Stunning hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, gorgeous rooms and lovely breakfast! Really enjoyed our stay and will be back! Great atmosphere around the hotel! The grounds surrounding the hotel are also lovely! ",5,2023,05,02
218,Racing trip,"We booked the hotel last minute as it was close to punchestown race course and our horse would be running there
It’s a fantastic hotel with great facilities 
The atmosphere was very friendly 
And the live music was a welcome surprise during the evening
We will be back next year",5,2023,05,01
218,Waste of money,"The service was not bad unfortunately the rooms was a absolute joke and dated ,  scuffs on walls , light fittings hanging off , rusty chain on bath, shower heads need cleaning should be ashamed of yourself! Carpet in hall ways to rooms need a good clean. The rooms where very dated (supposedly refurbished prior to our stay)total contradiction as the grounds and the lobby area etc where lovely such a shame as it is costly per nite to stay here.",1,2023,04,30
218,Relaxing stay,We had a family get together in Killashee Hotel. The hotel and gardens were beautiful.  It was very chilled and laid back. The staff were so friendly. The food was priced well and so well presented. I loved everything about my stay and will definitely be back,5,2023,04,29
218,Excellent,"My overall stay was excellent, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The food was excellent and the leisure centre was impressive. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely be returning. The bedroom is very spacious and in excellent order. ",5,2023,04,29
218,Very pleasant stay ,"Beautiful gardens, lovely comfortable quiet rooms, great choice on breakfast for vegetarians. Good options in bar for alcohol free beers. Professional check in/out. Ample parking. Ate dinner out in restaurant in Naas so cannot comment on bar food but a really nice stay. Would return ",4,2023,04,28
218,Wonderful stay,Wonderful hotel. Couldn't fault one thing. Not too often you find a fusion hairdryer and coffee machine in your room. Staff was friendly and helpful. Food was lovely.  Highly recommend and will be back again.  ,5,2023,04,27
218,Excellent,Had a lovely stay and the hotel is lively and the gardens are gorgeous.  Room was lively and comfortable. Lots to do in surrounding areas.  Would definitely recommend and will definitely return to Killashee again.,5,2023,04,26
218,Great group break at Killashee,"Had a great stay with a group of friends, the staff were excellent, the food was tasty, nothing was too much trouble. The lane swimming was great to have too. Plus it was really good value. Thank you for having us :).                                            ",5,2023,04,25
218,AMAZING,"This manor house hotel feels like an oasis when one needs to revive and rest!(though there is plenty to do if one wishes!) ALL the staff are amazing. The food is fabulous (we tried both The Pippin , for a romantic dinner and the Oak&Anvil for a more lively evening!) The room was superb and big enough to be able to chill during the day also!! The grounds are absolutely lovely and well kept. The hydrotherapy lounge is amazing. Next visit I will try the spa, and there WILL be a next visit we enjoyed it so much NOTE - it is a very short drive to Kildare village for retail therapy or the Japanese Gardens if one feels like an outing if the sun shines ....and much more! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",5,2023,04,23
218,4 Star Hotel with a 5 star service,"Excellent Hotel, recently refurbished with top class conference facilities with state of the art AV on hand.  Restaurant is very good and the staff are very friendly and what you would expect from a superior 4 star establishment. ",5,2023,04,22
218,Terrible Service.,"My wife and I were looking forward to our stay in Killashee . However, we were disappointed with the overall experience. The building itself is nice and tastefully decorated. The room was dusty and could do with a deep clean. The grounds are lovely and well-maintained.

 However, the service in the hotel is terrible. Most of the staff we dealt with were young and had little interest. We weren't given napkins (Or a drinks menu) with dinner in the restaurant on our first night. I asked the waitress for a napkin; I was still waiting 5 minutes later. I asked her again, and she said it was on the way. I eventually got it a few minutes later. This might not seem like a big deal, but when you are paying 200 a night, you expect good service. Some of the staff were downright rude, like the girl in the reception in the leisure centre, who looked like a moody teenager who rather be anywhere else.   There was a similar girl in the bar upstairs who had a detached, too-cool-for-school vibe going on. This hotel could do with experienced staff to oversee the junior staff and ensure good customer service. On our final day, we were woken up early by gardeners with chainsaws outside our window. We couldn't get back to sleep after this. We mentioned the noise at checkout, but the lady at reception said they just use a leaf blower in the mornings, which was not the case. I know a chainsaw when I hear it. I could even see the cut blocks and sawdust when walking on the grounds later.

 I wouldn't go back to this hotel in a hurry. I expected more from a 4-star hotel owned by FBD.",1,2023,04,22
218,Wedding guest - 1 night stay,"Generally a nice hotel, but somewhat overpriced.
My wife and I stayed at the hotel for a friend's wedding, so didn't have time to use the spa. 
Service is good, although staff were too eager to clear tables of unfinished drinks while people up dancing, but in fairness they did replace them when told after this happened a second time.",4,2023,04,20
218,Fabulous stay - from beginning to end,"We treated ourselves to an overnight in the Killashee recently to celebrate a special occasion. We pushed the boat out and went for a bed, breakfast and dinner deal. The hotel has been beautifully refurbished, and on check in, we were upgraded to a suite – what a nice surprise.  The suite, which overlooked rugby training grounds, consisted of two very spacious rooms – a living room and bedroom, with a large flat screen tv in each one. There was everything we could have wanted – kettle for making tea, coffee making machine, biscuits, bottled water, Lily O’Brien’s chocolates on the coffee table – the list is endless!  The bedroom was beautifully decorated, and the bed really big and comfortable. There was plenty of space in the wardrobe, an in-room safe (iron and ironing board, but what would you be doing ironing on a nice overnight break?) plus there was a dressing room with full-length mirror, and a Dyson hairdryer. On to the bathroom – another huge room with bath, shower, vanity table and his-and-hers wash hand basins, with Elemis toiletries. Our meal in the beautiful dining room was second to none, the service, the food, the environment, everything was just excellent. Sleep quality was great, and breakfast was served in the same dining room as the evening before.  Plenty of choice, lots of fresh fruit, cold meats, cereals, smoothies, pastries, breads, the usual fried items, all self-service.  Luckily the weather on the morning we were leaving was a total change from the downpours the day before, so we explored the extensive grounds before checking out.  This really is a beautiful hotel in gorgeous surroundings and is worth a visit even for coffee and exploration of the grounds. There is a leisure centre here but we didn’t use it on this occasion.  From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, we had a fabulous time, every member of staff we met was pleasant and smiling, which says a lot for the hotel itself.  We have no hesitation in recommending the Killashee and will gladly come back again for another stay.",5,2023,04,20
218,Dream Getaway!,"Perfect Getaway 20 min from Dublin! Staff was so friendly and helpful! Our room was upgraded, Food was absolutely Amazing! Spa, cocktails and all the details made our stay an unforgettable one!
Thank you Killashee! ❤️",5,2023,04,19
218,Fabulous Hotel and Stay,"My Fiancé and I booked a 2 night stay to celebrate our recent engagement, and were treated wonderfully by the friendly hotel staff. They had upgraded our room before we arrived at the hotel and left a lovely “congratulations on your engagement” dessert plate in our room for us which was a lovely gesture. The bathroom, bedroom, lounge and foyer of our room were absolutely spotless and also felt very luxurious. We couldn’t have asked for a better two night stay. We also attended the spa for treatments. The staff there were also friendly and helpful, and the spa itself was gorgeous! ",5,2023,04,19
218,Magical get away.,The hotel looked amazing when driving up to it. We were travelling with a 3 year old and a 2 year old.  There is so much space for children to run around. I would recommend bringing a ball as they have a full rugby pitch out the back that children can burn off energy. They have a small playground too which keeps kids entertained. The pool is a good size. The baby pool is about 18 inches deep which we found a good depth for our kids. ,5,2023,04,19
218,Family break,"Beautiful place with amazing gardens, great service, friendly staff, delicious food, live music Friday and Saturday nigts. For the families with small children there is a playground and a play room. One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Recommend 100%",5,2023,04,18
218,A nice stay,"We had an overnight stay as was visiting family in the area.
The grounds and leisure facilities are very good.
The spa mixed up our appointments which was a shame but the manager was very helpful trying to make good the situation.
Our room was quite noisy at first but it settled down eventually.  
Breakfast was ok. 
Service of staff was all very good.
Cleanliness was also very good. ",3,2023,04,17
218,Beautiful Property,The property is beautiful.  Our overall experience was great.  Our kids loved the playground and the pool.  The breakfast was a very satisfying full Irish breakfast supplemented with a few things like pancakes which my kids appreciated.,4,2023,04,17
218,So worth a visit,"Can’t recommend this place enough. I’ve stayed in hotels that are classed as a higher ranking than this and if I’m honest, some of them weren’t as good. 
The staff were so nice and one thing I noticed was how many of them there was.
 You were never waiting on anyone..loads of staff. 
The room was nice…we had two double beds. The food was fab and we got white glove service even in the more casual eatery. 
It really was value for money. 
Only downfall I have is the pool is in a separate building, so u have to cross the car park to get to pool..which is a bummer with wet hair etc… 
But it wouldn’t stop me using again. 
I would DEFINITELY recommend  this hotel to anyone. We sent some relatives there and they loved it too. 
It’s not cheap…. But it’s really good value for money .",5,2023,04,16
218,Gem of a place,"The most beautiful hotel with very smiley staff,stunning surroundings made to feel very welcomed,exceptionally clean and comfortable,food delicious and beautifully served breakfast the best produce 5 out of 5 ",5,2023,04,16

Comfortable gallery area with plenty of seating for drinks and board games. Playroom for smaller kids. Short drive into Naas. Would definitely recommend and will be back,5,2023,04,14
218,Poor accommodation,"Very draughty room windows hot water in the shower not consistent jumping from hot and cold for the money we paid we got nothing different in the room mattress was not that comfortable the only modern thing in the room was the Dyson hairdryer even the radiator was old fashioned.
Some off the staff were friendly in fairness and very welcoming but 1 man who took our order in the bar barley spoke just done the bare minimum and we more or less just got a grunt which for the money we were paying we were expecting more off a friendly experience.",2,2023,04,13
218,Fantastic stay at Killashee,"Amazing weekend break in Killashee hotel. Very family oriented. Staff can’t do enough for you, so helpful and pleasant. Room was fantastic. Fantastic leisure facilities and spa, though you need to book well in advance for a treatment there.  Would highly recommend a stay there.",5,2023,04,12
218,Easter stay,Excellent stay. Very friendly staff and the food was very good also. Our young son is celiac and the hotel had good options for him. The swimming pool was great for the kids. Thanks and we will be back.,5,2023,04,12

218,Beautiful place,Clean everyone was friendly i enjoyed My stay the food was great. Just had to track someone down at oak and anvil to order which was frustrating.  Everything was very clean and i would Definitely stay here again ,5,2023,04,09
218,Family Stay,"We had a lovely stay in a family room which was clean and spacious. Bathroom needs a little updating but they were clean. Food at the Oak and Anvil restaurant was lovely. Breakfast was ok, some food didn’t smell and taste right so we avoided but overall there was a great selection for breakfast with plenty of made to order items like pancakes etc. Unfortunately from the minute you walk in the door there is a very strong scent like a cheap air fresheners being pumped through the hotel. We all found it quite overpowering which I think took from the overall quality of the hotel. ",4,2023,04,09
218,Brilliant Staff,"I was overwhelmed by friendliness of all staff, atmosphere was excellent and lovely setting from moment of arrival to departure felt all at home 
If there is one flaw it’s getting to the rooms you go on a tour to get there 
Also the access to the leisure centre ",5,2023,04,08

218,Pleasant Stay at Killashee,"Atmospheric and historic hotel with fabulous grounds. The old part of the hotel is magnificent and you can use it all the time. The gardens are beautiful and enticing for an evening stroll. Attentive staff, great facilities. Nice and relaxing stay overall.",5,2023,04,05
218,Lovely hotel stay,"Great hotel, excellent food and service. Rooms are recently done up but bathrooms are a bit dated. The stay are lovely. Location is great, right beside Naas. The breakfast was nice but very busy and they ran out of some food items so get down early for breakfast if you’re staying. ",5,2023,04,04
218,Perception Vs Reality,"Upon arrival to the stunning grounds, one would expect the service to at a minimum meet expectations. Whilst the decor and refurbishment of the estate is well received the hotel is failing in effective leadership and management. The staff are plentiful and pleasant, however there is no sense of order or structure. The pipin restaurant we received at minimum 4 different wait staff resulting in repeating orders constantly. A total of 4 hours for dinner service for 4 adults, the desert arrived first and re explained that we were still awaiting appetizers. A total of 3 steaks were ordered with various cooking preferences, all arrived well done. Usually one would mention this to staff, however due to the duration it took for the main meal to arrive, the never ending carousel of staff yet it seemed the simple request of milk for the tea already poured at the table was too much not to mention a mediocre meal. Some basic organization and structure would help, assign a waiter to certain table numbers for example to ensure consistency and accuracy of orders. 

The venue has potential to be a dream location for a wedding or special event, however the service is  below poor in the restaurant’s for dinner and breakfast.  It is hoped that service improves so the business can operate to its maximum potential mirroring the exceptional standard of the existing grounds and refurbishment. ",3,2023,04,02
218,Attention to detail in a beautiful hotel,"Every corner of Killashee hotel is beautiful, foyer, restaurant, hallways, staircases, rooms. I have to assume it is not 5 star because the leisure centre is in a separate building. For me, losing the luxury of walking to and from in my robe was more than made up for with the luxury of my very affordable room.",5,2023,03,31

218,Excellent Hotel,"A lovely hotel, we stayed for a special occasion and had a lovely stay, food was excellent as was the service. Our room was terrific and spacious, a walk across the carpark to the leisure facilities was a big draw back if it was  in the rain. Worth a visit",4,2023,03,21

218,Superb Property amazing service ,"Outstanding overnight stay. From the drive up to the property right the way through, our stay was superb. The property is stunning and recently refurbished to an impeccable standard. Check in, was seamless and the journey to the room was a delight,  the fragrance in the air , the exquisite furniture and stunning features, attention to detail is clearly a priority in Kilashee.  Dinner was served in the most beautiful setting and staff were professional, knowledgeable and attentive.  Food was excellent and the cocktails are fantastic.  The room was spotless, warm, spacious and beautifully presented. Very comfortable and despite a very busy Saturday night there was no noise in the corridor/ coming from the bar. Beds are huge and most comfortable.
Breakfast was excellent and beautifully cooked and presented. Thanks to Nicole for taking time to chat with us ( and everyone at breakfast) We enjoyed a leisurely walk in the gardens before checking out.  Only negative is that we didn't stay longer. We'll be back to visit the Spa next time with afternoon tea! Amazing hotel!",5,2023,03,19
218,Fabulous overnight stay.,We stayed here for a romantic night away and was perfect and no too far from home. Perfect place to relax and recharge. We are in The Pippin Tree it was lovely. Will try The Oak & Anvil next time. All the staff lovely and helpful. ,5,2023,03,19
218,A surprising find,We were looking for a one night stay and find Killashee at what seemed like good value. We arrived late at night and were struck By how beautiful the building looked. There were plenty of places to sit around and relax and we were sort to not have more time there to simply relax. We did book the hydrotherapy pool on the morning that we left and would highly recommend. It is well worth the €10 per person for hotel guests. Breakfast was more than adequate with lots of choices in a very pleasant room. We will definitely be returning in the future and would highly recommend it. ,5,2023,03,15

218,Lovely break,"Only 40 mims drive from Dublin but felt like a real get away. Very tastefully decorated and great service. Loved the breakfast, probably the nicest Hotel breakfast we have had. We stayed as a couple but it would be perfect for a family break. ",5,2023,03,07
218,Stunning hotel with one issue - too hot,"This hotel has got everything right - except its heat level. With no air con, no way to adjust air temp (catches on window so can only open partially) heavy duvet, no alternative bedding. Be aware if you prefer a cooler environment.",4,2023,03,07
218,Family gathering,"Fantastic service and food . Nothing was a problem  . We had a large party and the staff were so attentive and helpful . Everyone’s food arrived at once and was fresh and flavoursome .

Staff in reception were very helpful when booking the meal and allowing me to decorate the table before . 

I’d highly recommend",5,2023,03,06
218,Wonderful mid week stay,We had a wonderful midweek stay at Killashee Hotel.  From start to finish we were treated so well by all the staff. Excellent value and wonderful staff from reception to Breakfast staff.Keep up the brilliant work. ,5,2023,03,04
218,Pleasant stay,"We went on the one night  Hydrotherapy package. Excellent value . Not all the facilities in the Hydrotherapy were working on the day that we were there. The dinner was very good, although there was a restricted menu, there was plenty of choice. ",4,2023,03,03
218,"Excellent service, relaxing spa experience","The staff are very polite and quite efficient. The room I stayed in was lovely, clean and very comfortable. 
 The spa was wonderful, there's not a huge range of treatments but the atmosphere is very relaxing. ",4,2023,03,02
218,Birthday Celebration,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff. However they struggled with breakfast service when hotel was at full capacity. Lovely grounds for walking and great facilities. Even a dyson hairdryer in the room. 50 mins from Dublin .",4,2023,02,28
218,Leisure break,"Overnight leisure break, over 65s, location close to Dublin. Good for quick break, very good service, meal options, nice grounds for walking.
Good sized rooms, overall a very nice hotel and relaxing for a brief stay",4,2023,02,28
218,Great escape,"We had a lovely night away meeting up with friends, good food, drinks, lovely room. Breakfast served until 11 so lie-in was great. The grounds are beautiful. The bar had live music in the evening. We did not get to visit the spa so will have to come back again!",5,2023,02,27
218,Overnight stay for concert,"A lovely overnight stay at the Killashee. Staff are very helpful and the rooms are lovely. Breakfast was excellent, with a couple of restaurants to choose from for lunch and dinner. 
On the night of our stay, there was a football match on as well as concert so understandably the  hotel was very busy. However, during the early evening before the match and concert, it did take a long time for drinks to be served in the bar with some long queues at times. There was only one member of staff serving and so perhaps another member of staff behind the bar would have helped to reduce the queues for drinks. 
But overall, an excellent stay and a wonderful hotel.",5,2023,02,26
218,Fairytale castle,Such a beautiful idyllic setting was stunning friendly staff very helpful my only complaint was the bed was too hard and room too warm however I’m very pregnant currently so that’s a me problem not a hotel problem will definitely be back again for a stay practically a 5star hotel our midweek rate b&b was only €150 and to get such luxury for that price was phenomenal I’d of paid double that in other high ranking hotels which don’t compare.,5,2023,02,25
218,Dead flies on window sill and poor slow service in the oak and anvil,"Dead flies in the room , room was nicely decorated, lovely bathroom with character. Staff spent a lot of time talking and standing around in the oak and anvil. Staff were slow to serve us. Ribs were cold upon arrival ",3,2023,02,24
218,Great hotel,"We visited the hotel a week ago for just one night, everything here was brilliant the staff are very friendly. I would like to give a special thank you to Bernie from the breakfast staff who was extremely helpful and a lovely lady, her service was 5 stars for us, Michelle on the reception was also very helpful and friendly. The hotel is very lucky to have staff like these two ladies, Kind Regards, Sylwia and Pawel.

218,Killashee hotel,"Went to the Killashee hotel for a few days after our wedding,upgraded to the bridal suite at no extra cost. Facilities are top class,a trip to the spa is a must. Both restaurant's serve beautiful food & good selection of drink's. We will be going back next year,that's for sure. ",5,2023,02,22
218,Lovely hotel,"Very comfortable, spacious hotel with great facilities. Expected slightly nicer decor and spa but rooms and restaurant and grounds all lovely. Very pleasant helpful staff. Very family friendly also, as we had a young baby with us. ",3,2023,02,22
218,Family half term break,Another return to Killashee hotel. There has been a refurb from we were here last July and the hotel looks great. The room was a double deluxe with 2 double beds and fitted our needs. Kids loved the playroom and woodland walks. Looking forward to another return trip! ,5,2023,02,21
218,Excellent Location,"Great location with excellent leisure facilities. Restaurant very good with a good menu. However, staff at breakfast could be friendlier and more efficient. Couldn’t help feeling that it was a burden for the breakfast staff and management to be there…. ",4,2023,02,21
218,Poor stay this time,"What once was a lovely hotel with great service, has turned into another hotel struggling to get it right. Breakfast service was a disaster, inefficient, poor service resulting in hangry kids leaving without their breakfast. It was a disaster. No excuse",1,2023,02,21
218,good value at a well priced hotel,Beautiful hotel and friendly staff and with greater attention to staffing at breakffast and food variety at dinner the hotel could be exceptional. Hydrotherapy pool is well worth a visit and the spa treatments are excellent.,4,2023,02,19
218,Lovely hotel & very helpful staff.,"A lovely hotel with lots to keep kids entertained, but also really nice option for a couples get-away. 

All the staff we met were very friendly & helpful. 

Be aware that the pool is more a public leisure centre so can be quite busy with swim lessons / classes etc. ",5,2023,02,18
218,Mr. Colin Pryor,"Beautiful setting, wonderful hotel and extremely helpful staff. I would definitely recommend stopping here. All the facilities you need for both a short or long stay. Some of the signs and access to rooms are a little convoluted but you can live with that because it's such a lovely hotel. ",5,2023,02,17
218,Well worth a visit,"Beautiful hotel and grounds, excellent experience despite a very busy bank holiday weekend. B+B+D offer was very good value with superb restaurant food and excellent service. Hydrotherapy suite was a highlight, rooms were spacious and spotless. Bar food was middling and drinks prices higher than expected (€6.60 for pint Coors, €9 for glass Rosé) but staff were fantastic, atmosphere was lovely and we'll definitely visit again.",4,2023,02,15
218,Good & bad,"Nice venue but avoid the overpriced poor quality food. Eat in the town, better choice snd quality. 
Rooms need an overhaul. Broken window, draft continually. Bathrooms are poor in bedrooms. 
Good facilities for young children, park is lovely. ",3,2023,02,15
218,Third time we’ve been.,"This was our third stay at Killashee and the reason that we keep coming back is because we love it! This time we were lucky enough to be in the Bell Tower Room in the old part of the house. A lovely room with a very spacious en suite bathroom. 
We ate twice in the Oak and Anvil restaurant and the food was excellent. Embarrassed to admit that on our last night we couldn’t decide what sweet to share so we ended up ordering three! Great service from the staff as always. See you again.",5,2023,02,14
218,great overnight stay,"We stayed here to have a break with 2 kids. The first issue is getting more common with ""Family"" rooms, they give you 2 double beds.. grand if the are very young or of same sex but with a boy and girl who will refuse to share a bed! Thankfully in this case we explained the dilemma and they upgraded us to a room with an extra single bed. Its just a pity they didn't do room with a double and 2 singles.. that said.. The Room was very spacious with 2 queen size beds and a single. For me :) an Nespresso machine and kettle for tea was an extra, There was a 65"" smart tv with uk and Irish stations, and Netflix/PriveVideo app was installed too.The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was fairly standard affair, Bath/Shower. We had a package so meals were include. The dinner was an excellent 3 course meal with dessert and tea/coffee. Breakfast was standard buffet affair but I would like to add there was a generous selection of Gluten free pastries/Bread  as well as the facility to order a Gf fry too.My Wife was overjoyed about this. We didnt get to use the pool/gy/Spa facilities but from what I saw it looked excellent. The Grounds are beautiful as well with a nice playground and some beautiful small gardens as well as a DEBRA butterfly garden. Overall we had a wonderful stay.
  ",5,2023,02,14
218,comfortable.,"Better value for money being charged. I have been  to other hotels and it has cost a lot less for a room of similar size and quality. To be honest the bathroom was not the best , the shower had some kind of insect running around in it , the plumming  was not working in one of the wash bowls. The noise coming from air unit  sounded like a engineering factory all night. and it was not the cleanest of bathrooms.",4,2023,02,10
218,A magical stay thanks to the staff,"We really enjoyed our time here. On arrival, Orla at reception was an absolute pleasure and she made my daughter feel amazing and she really listened to her and made our whole stay very magical. My daughter was so excited to see Orla again at check out the next morning. She was very helpful and couldn’t have done more for us.

Lunch was very nice, dinner excellent and breakfast was nice and relaxing with excellent food and service.

The room was huge and the bed was so comfortable. The Dyson hairdryer was a nice addition and the nice coffee machine was a bonus. Only issue with the room was the bathroom. The water in the shower was cold, we tried everything but couldn’t get it to heat up no later how long we tried. Ended up having to wash with the shower head in the bath. The taps made so much noise when turned on and spat out water when we tried to get hotter water. Oh and some used tissue in the bedside locker but that didn’t bother us much as everything else was perfect and really really clean so it was just a small oversight.

The swimming poor was busy with a class so we could only use the children’s pool but it was good fun and the staff member in reception was very helpful. Shame it’s a separate building with no access from the hotel apart from through a car park. 

The gardens were fabulous and the playground was brilliant. We really enjoyed walking through the grounds. Fabulous, hard work and commitment by a very talented gardening team I’d imagine. 

Over all we had an amazing stay and we are looking forward to returning. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends with no hesitation. My daughter Sophie is excited to return again soon.",5,2023,02,10
218,Relaxing Stay ,"I stayed recently with a couple  of friends and we had such a lovely break. The hotel was buzzing as it was a bank holiday. We were so impressed from the time we arrived. The grounds are beautiful and we had a lovely walk around although it was almost dusk on a moonlight night when we set off.  We had been having such a relaxing time munching our way through all the options of the delicious afternoon teas with plenty of top ups of tea and coffee from a very attentive staff. The hotel has a very relaxed and chilled vibe and the decor is amazing throughout. We particularly loved the  Larkspur lounge with its big comfy sofas and chairs. We dined in the Pippin restaurant on the Sunday night and the food  was delicious. The room itself looked gorgeous in the candle light.
Our rooms were spotless and very comfortable with everythung you would need including slippers. Elemis products, A huge TV, coffee maker, kettle etc .Breakfast was lovely but i would advise going early at weekends as it was  busy when we arrived around 10.20. There was a long queue developing but we were seated quickly and then helped ourselves to the carvery breakfast. We did not avail of the gym , spa or pool but we had a peak inside with the staff permission and it  all looked great. In the grounds there is a lovely play area  for younger kids and of course the swimming pool looked like a popular spot!",5,2023,02,10
218,Lovely hotel in beautiful surroundings,"Friendly staff, lovely decor with original features. We stayed in the original house and it was very quiet. Lovely views from large sash windows. Great spa experience with lovely attentive staff. Highly recommend.",5,2023,02,09
218,Beautiful hotel and great atmosphere,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful, all the staff from reception to the spa were extremely friendly. The room was amazing and food in the bar was so tasty. I will most definitely be a returning customer.",5,2023,02,08
218,1 night stay,"Deluxe room was comfortable, toilet/shower room left a lot to be desired, we paid the same as another couple we traveled with €400 for one night, dinner and spa treatment but the ended up with a suite and we had a deluxe bed....??? swimming pool looked tired and basic, pool was not overly warm, not attached to the hotel, possibility of getting wet if raining etc. restaurant was really lovely, food was great, staff were very helpful throughout our stay.",4,2023,02,08
218,Nice Hotel - Pity about the service,"We stayed here as a treat on the bank holiday weekend. The places looks really nice. Unfortunately the service lets everything else down. 
We ate in the Oak and Anvil and while the food was really nice the service was poor. Anything we asked for had to be asked for more than once and some of the drinks order (ordered when the mains arrived) came as we asked for the bill. We had 5 or 6 different servers over the two hours. The same at breakfast - coffees took a long time to arrive; and again in the lobby area - hot scones were cold by the time the cappachinos arrived and after another age we were told the muffins would be 30 mins. Our room, again, not up to standard for a 4 star - cracked tiles all over the bathroom floor and wall and the shower was luke warm at best. Aside from that the beds are comfortable and the place was clean. 
",3,2023,02,07
218,Fab venue with great service,"My wife and I had a one night break here for her birthday celebration and it was wonderful. Beautiful decor, lovely room and the food was top class. We stayed here due to its proximity to Kildare Village and it was a great call. I'd highly recommend ",5,2023,02,07
218,Wonderful hotel,"Another lovely stay at Killashee. Close to the Kildare Village Outlet & Dublin. The hotel itself is lovely and caters for all. The staff are friendly and helpful and all appear to enjoy working here, the quality of food is also very good. ",5,2023,02,06
218,Lovely looking hotel in beautiful grounds,"First impression of the Hotel is great, nice looking in well maintained grounds with a pleasant trail to walk around. 

Staff are very helpful and there is plenty of lounge areas to relax and socialise. 

Rooms/Bathroom could do with a bit updating and surprisingly were quite warm. With no air conditioning or the windows opening wide enough it did make the room a bit warm.
",4,2023,02,06
218,Business trip,"Fantastic hotel, its all in the little details - the coffeemaker in the room, dyson hairdryer, and huge comfortable beds. 
Breakfast had a wider selection and nothing was too much trouble to the staff. ",5,2023,02,02
218,"Rathmore GAA, Co Kerry.","In Jan 2023, Rathmore GAA (Kerry) were lucky enough to be in the All Ireland Intermediate Club Football Final (which we won). We stayed in the Killashee Hotel the night before the final - a very important step in our journey. There was 61 people in total. The hotel and staff looked after the entire squad and management to a standard only professional teams can expect. The facilities (training field, gym, swimming pool, etc) were to be highly recommended as for the service and food was second to none. Plenty of everything and any request was never a problem. All 61 people in the group could only compliment the service - well done to staff and management of the Killashee Hotel. I think you can expect more bookings from Rathmore, Co Kerry.  
Thanks for you support and  service on such an important night in our clubs history. 
Regards Arthur - Rathmore GAA, Co Kerry.  All Ireland Intermediate Club Football Champions 2023.

218,"Brilliant weekend at Killashee Hotel and Spa, definitely worth a visit.","We have just returned from a brilliant weekend at Killashee Hotel and Spa.  The staff were amazing even under pressure.   The suite we stayed in was in the original part of the building and it was very clean and very well presented.   The breakfast was amazing, the restaurant was very nice as well and the Pippin restaurant was very well managed but as it was so busy it took a little longer between courses.  The only thing I would say about the menu is it was a little short on choices, there didn't seem to be any vegetables and portion sizes were a little small but what was on your plate was very enjoyable.   I would recommend a stay here for anyone travelling to Naas or the surrounding area.
Thank you to all the staff for the wonderful job they did  especially at Sunday morning breakfast. ",5,2023,01,31
218,Wonderful chilled weekend,"I just wanted to send a note of HUGE thanks to the hotel for a wonderful stay at the weekend.

I was met by Megan (Met Michelle on check out another lovely person) and what a fabulous professional person, so warm and welcoming and from that moment on I loved my stay, my room was so cosy and I slept like a log (love the Dyson hair dryer), the food in the bar was delicious and the staff were lovely too, I used the pool area which was so relaxing and lovely. Overall I really chilled out and that’s what we all need from a break away.

I have told so many friends and colleagues about it, will def be back and the entire hotel looks fantastic.",5,2023,01,30
218,Disappointed,"I choose that nominated hotel to celebrate my birthday but it’s a completely disappointing experience I mentioned it’s my birthday when I made a reservation and on checkin, what a surprise no welcome card or any mention to my bday  at room or at dinner , decoration totally dated .
I don’t recommend at all not especial",1,2023,01,27
218,Babymoon,This was our second stay at Killashee Hotel and we really enjoyed our getaway before our first baby arrives. The food in both the restaurants (Oak and Anvil) and (the Pippin Tree) was delicious and the service was excellent. All staff throughout the hotel are very friendly and trained well. I rated the hotel 4/5 because the breakfast service let it down but if you go to breakfast early enough then I don't think this would be an issue.,4,2023,01,25
218,Excellent short break,"Kilashee is a great venue for a break from everyday life. We stayed just one night, but used the leisure centre and the Pippin Tree restaurant with excellent results. We had the package that includes dinner and breakfast.",5,2023,01,22
218,Beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in beautiful grounds, conveniently located for our travels needs to Dublin and Kildare, staff were truly lovely, helpful and just the right amount of engagement however the bathroom in our room was in need of renovation.",4,2023,01,22
218,Truly relaxing,"Just stepped away for a night to Kilashee Hotel. It was our first time here and  it has been truly relaxing. We brought our baby and everywhere in the hotel seemed baby friendly. There was even a play room with lots of toys. Amazing shower and lovely room. Very friendly  and helpful staff. There are lovely cosy lounge areas to unwind and sip a drink or read. We hope to return again. So many hotels these days seem carbon copies of each other. This hotel has a  class and elegance about it. Definitely recommend a stay here. 
Niamh,  Wicklow",5,2023,01,21
218,Average hotel,"This is a lovely hotel but the food, service and general ambiance is very average. 
We had a package with dinner, bed and breakfast and 1 hour in the hydrotherapy pool. We went directly to the pool after unpacking and were allowed to go to the hydrotherapy pool earlier than our booking. This area is beautiful and really relaxing with very nice reception staff but we then went to the ordinary swimming pool which was overcrowded and had no facility to sit and relax. The changing area was very busy also but the most disappointing part of the spa experience was that residents if the hotel have to walk through the car park to get to and from the spa. This should be addressed somehow by this hotel. 
Dinner was just average but the service was very slow and staff did but seem to be well trained. Breakfast was not good at all, toaster only toasted on one side and was very slow. My fried egg had a skin in it and the sausages and bacon were cold. 
Room was well proportioned with a few nice touches, such as a Dyson hair dryer, bottled water and a decent coffee machine but no glasses in the room or in the bathroom so nothing to use to rinse my mouth after brushing my teeth. 
Not sure we will return to this hotel which is a pity as I would have loved to walk the gardens in better weather.",3,2023,01,18
218,Just exquisite! Highly Highly recommend.,"Exceptional service from management and staff. From the placed booking till we left yesterday was amazing.  The atmosphere for afternoon tea for 11 ladies was calm organised and efficient, with lots of chats and laughter . Food was delicious! Fresh, tasty and well presented. It was all of the little details that ( I hope I got the managers name right) Conor did that made it so easy for us. The prosecco cooled, the cake and cupcakes presented beautifully and the kilashee boxes to take home some cake individually was just the exquisite.  Could not of asked for anything more! ",5,2023,01,15
218,S&C,"Lovely clean hotel with great amenities and staff excellent 
Food and rooms were perfect would highly recommend and look forward to staying here again

Great selection of restaurant food and bars and great breakfast ",5,2023,01,10

218,New Year’s Eve,"One of the highlights of 2022 …. Upon arriving (much earlier than expected) you could see how busy the reception was with people checking out. We were greeted by a very friendly member of staff who had a quick look and had a room straight away and also got us a table for lunch.

The room was everything you would expect, immaculately clean, spacious warm and cosy. Our first meal of the stay was in the oak and anvil bar again greeted by really pleasant staff and when the food came out it did not disappoint. Following lunch we had booked into the spa …. Anyone coming here the hydro pool is a must.

The main reason for our stay was to ring in the new year with the gala dinner and wow it did impress. Food, music, drinks and atmosphere throughout was amazing. 

The only negative feedback was we didn’t stay an extra day to fully walk the grounds as they looked stunning.  

The staff and cleanliness set such a high standard considering how busy the hotel was  no doubt 10/10 ",5,2023,01,03
218,Outstanding. Everything,"Our general experience in the Killashee Hotel was outstanding, despite it was very busy. There was a wedding at the same time with several guests. The staff was very supportive and efficient. Our room was huge, with a large bed and very comfortable pillows, all according to the room's size and quality. There was a whirlpool bathtub with a shower apart, out of the bathtub. The parking spaces were large and enough. The dinner (menu) and the following breakfast were delicious. Important to know: unexpectedly, the communication between the hotel and the leisure centre is...through the uncovered parking. So, be careful if it is raining or you are wearing a bathrobe only!",5,2023,01,01
218,Creepi,"One word, creepy! Myself and my partner stayed x1 night in the ‘orginal house’. We got the winter wellness package and really enjoyed our massages in the spa and dinner in the restaurant. The room however, from the minute we walked into the orginal house the place was ice cold, our room was big must have been a suite of some kind however it had a very ery feeling the minute you walked in. So much so, that myself and my partner left during the night as we couldn’t sleep. The hotel itself was very nice but I would avoid staying at the orginal house.",3,2022,12,28
218,"Beautiful, comfortable stay","Stayed for an Xmas party, brought my partner and 1yr old along, room was beautiful, big spread for breakfast nice little added feature was the children's playroom! Booking another stay for the New year!",5,2022,12,22

218,Great hotel!,We had a lovely one night stay and were very impressed with the hotel and gardens. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The rooms are very comfortable and have everything you need. I was particularly pleased they had such a good choice in gluten free food. More of a choice on the set menu would be great but overall we had a fantastic stay and will definitely come back. ,5,2022,12,17
218,Superb!!!,"Stayed here for over a week , very lovely surroundings and normally a wedding or two at the weekends which can make it quite lively.
The first room I had was the slightly less exuberant and had a small TV in a cupboard, older shower and the bed was not so comfy. I had asked if possible to change rooms, which was possible thanks to the lovely staff. The next room had a big TV with YouTube and a very comfortable bed and was very nice. The Breakfast was delicious every day, with a lot of choices. Staff were great, and the setting is very nice, so be sure to take a walk around and explore the gardens. Very enjoyable stay here. Booked in here again a week or so later, this time I got to stay in the old part of the hotel in the amazing suites, fantastic place couldn't fault it. ",5,2022,12,13
218,Excellent,"Kilashee is an absolutely beautiful place.so well maintained, excellent, friendly, helpful staff,brilliant service, fabulous food .
We attended for a weddi and it was just so amazing and beautiful from start to finish.
I have stayed here before for a spa break with my daughter and loved n enjoyed it then too.
Keep up the great work!",5,2022,12,13
218,Great hotel and excellent service,"We just stayed one night but it was very relaxing. Lovely food in the Pippin Restaurant and the upstairs bar is spacious and peaceful. We had a long delay waiting for our room to be ready, but staff handled it well. We were given an upgrade and the suite we were given was superb. Would definitely recommend for a couples getaway. ",5,2022,12,13
218,great stay :),"To be honest we couldn't had hoped for more, food was really good, the staff super friendly and nice... okay, you might get lost looking for your room but that's the beauty of the place too ; ) Only thing I could comment on is that they're still doing refurbisment works in the hotel and really early in the morning they start with drilling, painting, moving furniture and such.. but I guess once they're finished that will be the end of it. Overall a great experience, we'll be back!",5,2022,12,12
218,"Really, really good","What a great hotel.

I picked Naas in general as I was in Kildare for work and the Killashee in particular as I’d heard great things about the staff from a couple of colleagues. The biggest bugbear I ever have is customer service, the feeling you get when you are made welcome sticks with you for a long time. 

The staff:
From the moment I arrived yesterday till the moment I checked out the staff were superb. Reception was a breeze and welcoming.

The bar staff were prompt, knowledgable and friendly and the drinks menu had a wide selection of gins and whiskeys, always a plus.

At dinner the manager made a point of saying introducing himself and the waiters were prompt, friendly and not overbearing.

The breakfast staff were every bit as good and it makes you want to come back.

The food:
The food was well presented, properly cooked and tasty, not too much and not too little, the burger and spicy onion rings were great and for dessert the baked cheesecake  was delicious.  

Breakfast was a full Irish and gallons of tea,  one of the nicest full Irish I’ve had in a while.

The hotel:
The hotel is finished to a high standard and the rooms are clean, large and warm, everything you would expect from a FBD hotel.  Not sure if it’s deliberate but the taps in the bathroom sink seem to work backwards but sure why not.

The gardens are amazing, it was a frosty night, full moon, planets and stars everywhere, it is hard to believe I was 5 minutes from town.  It is the type of large hotel that seems very intimate, I’m seldom this impressed on a work night away but it’s smashing.

Kudos to the management team, everyone working there had a smile and a hello and it didn’t seem forced.  It is priced well and I’ll be coming back.",5,2022,12,07
218,Great hotel for relaxing night away,"Rooms were spacious and clean. Hotel was stunning. We had dinner in the hotel and both food and service was fantastic. Blackout curtains in the room with a few nice extra features like netflix, nespresso machine and dyson hairdryer. Hydrotherapy suite was really enjoyable.",5,2022,12,07
218,Family stay at Killashee Hotel,"Service and food was excellent however the rooms were very shabby indeed.  
Holes in carpet, furniture damaged, safe that didn't work. Bathroom very poor quality including toilet seat that wan't fitted properly. Would not stay there again unless there was a significant improvement to the quality of the rooms.",2,2022,12,04
218,A lot of staff issue's ,"We booked 2 nights b&b in killashee hotel for a birthday treat, we found the experience very poor.  We had lunch in the Oak & Anvil restaurant on first evening, it took 3 hours to have a 2 course meal! The staff were all very young and obviously they had not received/had any training. It took 45 minutes from we ordered dessert until it finally arrived to our table. When we inquired about it after a approximately 20 minutes wait we were informed that our order had been lost?? All in all over priced and a very disappointing stay. Martina. ",2,2022,12,03
218,Great hotel and excellent service.,"Excellent from start to finish. Lovely welcome at reception from Helen. Room was beautiful and fresh, very comfortable bed and so clean. Had dinner in Oak and Anvil. Nice welcome from man at host desk. Service was great from Nicola who looked after us very well.  Will definitely be back for a chocolate martini. Breakfast was very nice with great offering. Staff were very busy but always smiling and gave us a great welcome. Nice walk in gardens which are very well looked after. Will definitely be back.",5,2022,12,01
218,5 star Vegan and Kids breakfast ,"Visited for breakfast twice this week as walk in guests. I am vegan, my daughter is vegetarian and the other guest just big foodies and we were all 100% catered for. Martina couldn't have been more helpful.  We were all incredibly taken aback by the standard of service and taste and verity of food served to us. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially Marrina who made both visits a pleasure. 
This is officially our new meet up spot.
5 star on kids breakfast (pamcakes were a treat) and vegan choices (full Irish breakfast available)",5,2022,12,01
218,Gorgeous Hotel,"Very gorgeous hotel. I have stayed there on multiple occasion for business and have always thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet, which means it is a pleasure to work and sleep in them. The staff is always incredibly friendly as well. Would definitely recommend staying here if visiting Naas.",5,2022,12,01
218,"Overall very good, shame about the service","I have just returned from a 2 night stay from the Killashee hotel and really enjoyed most of it.
The staff on reception were excellent, very friendly and welcoming. To get to the rooms is a bit confusing however the rooms themselves were very clean,cosy and comfortable. The spa treatments we had were amazing and loved the pool. 
The only bad thing was the service in the restaurant. It was very quiet when we placed our order, but the food (which was delicious when it came) took a long time and twice we had to go up to pick up our drinks order as it had been sitting on the bar for a while. This may have been down to being short staffed but the staff that were on didn't seem to be paying any attention at all.
It's such a pity that this happened as overall it is a amazing hotel.",4,2022,11,30
218,Superb,"Enjoyed to the full extent. Nice menu with quality food and excellent service. Luxurious surroundings, spacious with plenty of choice to sit and relax. Excellent leisure facility. I would definitely recommend",5,2022,11,30
218,November stay 2022,"Very luxurious hotel, staff are very hard working and friendly so much attention to detail in all areas of the hotel. I love the Christmas Decorations and Christmas atmosphere in the hotel. I loved the personal touch  of the chocolates left in my bedroom. It really made my stay special.",5,2022,11,29
218,Beautiful Hotel,"Have just enjoyed a two night relaxing B&B stay at this beautiful hotel. Staff very friendly, attentive & helpful. Breakfast was really good, selection was excellent. Very comfortable beds. Very high standard of cleanliness throughout hotel. Would definitely recommend. Probably the best hotel we have stayed in.  An interesting location.

",5,2022,11,25
218,Exceptional,"Beautiful hotel, what makes it extra special is the staff from the moment you walk in great welcome fantastic service great food and exceptional attention to detail.  Thank you all for making or stay memorable.  ",5,2022,11,25
218,Beautiful peaceful location minutes from the town,"Impressive hotel with friendly staff, beautifully presented gardens and amazing rooms. The process for B&B was e excellent also. Unfortunately due to the nature of my stay, i could not avail of the spa or leisure centre facilities but I hope that I will return and definitely get the chance to. ",5,2022,11,25
218,Sunday night break,"Great hotel and ground’s always pleasant to stay and a great nights sleep and the old house has a lovely charm and is quiet for so reading and relaxing , not too far from the town for a stroll and a great spa and leisure Center and gym ",5,2022,11,23
218,Lovely getaway ,"On arrival we were met by a lovely young guy on reception.  Our room was ready so we were able to check in immediately.  Our room was very clean and welcoming . A nice add on with the Dyson hairdryer however the cable was way too short to manage drying my hair properly.   The kettle had no sockets close by so used it on the floor.   We went down to the leisure centre for a swim and everything was well equipped.  Later for dinner we didn't book as we were going to the bistro so didn't feel the need , thought it was busy we were looked after a little while later . The food was fab .  I would have to say the breakfast staff were amazing , so helpful and friendly which is superb when you have children . Martina looked after us and couldn't do enough for us . I would definitely return and would highly recommend A+++",5,2022,11,22
218,Leisure,Staff very friendly. Chef went out of his way to oblige me with a special request on a busy night and it was delicious. Manager Nazir very friendly and took time to chat amongst the busyness. Bar staff also very friendly. 10 out of 10.,5,2022,11,22
218,Disappointed,"We travelled as as group not able to check in until late, rooms not cleaned,
Poor choice of drinks?untidy bar areas on the plus side the staff were very good and listened to the complaints. Managers are much to be desired, the staff need more training,",2,2022,11,22
218,"Noise from weeding guests, no sleep. Staff to young no experience, food very","I have requested a room in a very quiet area on the hotel to avoid drunk guests from  the wedding. We were put in the middle of them. There was people talking and slamming doors from 1am to 4h30 am we didn't sleep, an absolute  disgrace, never again. Staff in the restaurant was to young and with no training we had to beg for their attention and service. Food in the bar and restaurant not up to standard compared with other hotels. So over all not a place to go for a weekend break. Expensive and poor everything.",3,2022,11,22
218,Lovely hotel with great staff,Stayed here for 2 nights and it’s a beautiful old building with impeccable grounds. Hotel was busy with 2 weddings but staff were excellent. We had food in the restaurant on the first night and the service was quick and food was lovely. Only down side is that the leisure complex is in a different building which meant having to go outside in the rain ,5,2022,11,21
218,Looks so good sadly that's where the positive ends,"Arrived at 3 after a very long morning and just wanted to unpack and have q bath, 11 people only two rooms were ready,  waited until 4 but was fed up by then so eventually the manager found a couple more clean rooms , rest of the party still waiting at 4 due out at 5 so such a rush. Breakfast next morning was disorganised and didn't get drinks gave up. On returning to our room that evening dirty glasses from the night before still there, toilet roll not replenished, all used empty bath products left around the bath, no hot water for a shower. Booked a table for 11 people for 8 o'clock noticed no table set up when asking told he thought it was for  6 o'clock although email confirmation said 8.during the afternoon Could not get any food from the bar only full restaurant food not even an afternoon tea as told that finished at 3 poorly stocked fridge in bar. Finally booked a table for our breakfast together at 9 arrived at 9 no table or booking arranged said they would bring some chairs and push tables together, never happened. The staff were lovely but could not organise anything.  The breakfast was very good.",2,2022,11,21
218,simply amazing,"my sister and I stayed there twice this year and we really love it. The staff are so helpful, friendly and efficient. The building is beautiful and the grounds are a joy to walk around. The leisure centre and spa are just fantastic and again staff are so very helpful",5,2022,11,20
218,Excellent place to stay,"Excellent hotel, superb helpful staff, incredible food from both the bar, restaurant and even on room service.  Lovely atmosphere.  Can imagine it would be an excellent place to visit at Christmas time. Simply an all-round venue. ",5,2022,11,20
218,Disappointing,"Hugely disappointed with our stay. On arrival, check-in was unaware of our reservation until we produced written confirmation and even at that they thought we were staying for a longer duration!

When we did finally get to our room, we had to request drinking glasses as there were none in the room.

On returning to our room at approximately 10.00 am after breakfast our card keys would not work. we had to return to the check-in to have them reset. Then I decided to have a short walk in the gardens and when I returned at 11.40, once again the key card would not work, and my wife advised that there had been no power or lights in the room from about 11.30, which among other things made the toilet effectively out of bounds.
",2,2022,11,16
218,Consistently great,"Have stayed here several times, rooms are very comfortable, food is great and the Hotel and staff are always excellent. Without doubt I will be back here again, the birthday card was a lovely touch and very much appreciated. ",5,2022,11,15
218,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous hotel, beautiful gardens, enjoyable spa treatment and use of thermal suite. Delicious dinner and it's also close to Kildare village for a browse after our stay, highly recommend if you are thinking of booking",5,2022,11,11
218,Birthday Treat,Excellent service in a great location where the grounds are magnificently maintained. The only drawback was the Belling Wing - lift up to the 3rd floor (really the 1st floor as reception is on the ground floor) a long walk and then down in an other lift to the second floor. ,5,2022,11,09
218,Needs updating especially the spa,"A new smell when you walk in. Cleanliness needs more care by management especially in the rooms,and the spa is badly in need of an upgrade it hasn’t changed one bit in 15 years,but the staff all over the hotel and spa are excellent.",3,2022,11,09
218,Stunning Hotel,The hotel itself appears to have recently had a makeover and the decor and feel of the hotel is stunning. The grounds around the hote are lovely for a stroll and well maintained. The rooms themselves are large and the beds very comfortable. I would highly recommend ,5,2022,11,09
218,Very Good!,"Been here twice for work purposes and once for leisure!  Generally nice hotel, a lot of renovation work going on while I was there which could still be ongoing to bare that in mind, breakfast was also fantastic. Gym good too.

Only thing I didn’t like was the pillows and the TV also didn’t work in my room for my second stay here. 

Other than that, excellent, pleasant staff too and amazing scenery, good for a walk!",4,2022,11,08
218,Lovely friendly hotel,"Lovely hotel, nice food they need to have a look at there lighting in the bars and restaurants as it’s very bright and not at all relaxing or atmospheric . I would highly recommend the spa and we will be back as it is a great hotel with fantastic staff ",4,2022,11,08
218,Wedding,"Had a great time, food was excellent, love the buffet  breakfast. Great service. Staff very good, helpful, and friendly. Rooms massive, bed very comfortable, slept like a log. The grounds, a good walk round the hotel.",5,2022,11,07
218,Top Class Hotel,"Fabulous hotel. Gardens are lovely to walk around, even on the rainy day we were there. It was Halloween and kids activities were really good. 
Food in the Bistro was lovely and the areas around the hotel to relax in are really good.  
",5,2022,11,07
218,Return after many years,Having worked in Killashee for many years several years ago it has always remained a place that we would always recommend for people to visit and returning after all these years we were delighted to see that it is still as good as ever. A warm and friendly team under the leadership of Ger Alley and it was nice to see some of the original staff around. Thanks to Manjeet Sinead Louise and Marian for looking after us during our stay.,5,2022,11,06
218,Mid term break,"Very nice hotel, rooms bit dated but fine, breakfast wasn’t great, dinner in bistro is nicer than restaurant, very overpriced for food though. Swimming pool is nice, changing rooms freezing. Lot of painting going on the days I was there but didn’t get in the way, obviously short on bar staff in the bar because it’s nearly impossible to get served for a drink",4,2022,11,06
218,Spa break,"Overall enjoyed the stay and spa, nice relaxing hotel. Very nice spa. Lobby areas were very nice especially reception and upstairs. But food and service in bistro bar and breakfast were very disappointing, very over priced. ",3,2022,11,04
218,Excellent experience,"Myself my sisters and my mam booked the spa package away for a girly night away. We had an excellent stay. The dinner was delicious, our treatments were excellent and the hydrotherapy pool added to the relaxation. The breakfast was amazing with such an excellent variety of options and a particular thanks to Bernie who looked after us so well t breakfast. Would definitely recommend a stay.",5,2022,11,04
218,Wonderful Hotel,Wonderful hotel for a trip away.  Beautiful surroundings and extremely friendly and helpful staff. We had both dinner and breakfast in the hotel and the food was delicious.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2022,11,04
218,Thoroughly enjoyed,"Had dinner in the Hotels bistro recently - really enjoyed the warm, welcoming atmosphere achieved by all staff present! Both food and service was great! Menu catered to all tastes and there was no waiting around to be seated. 
This property truly feels like 5* - incredible decor and tasteful refurbishments (which I'm guessing were quite recent as the lovely receptionist encouraged us to have a look at the new gallery upstairs) 
Would highly recommend this place for dining! Looking forward to booking a night away here sometime soon!",5,2022,11,03
218,5 star,"From the moment I put my foot on the luxurious carpet and entered the warm bright lobby I was impressed. It is newly renovated and completed to a very high standard,so bright and relaxing. The decor was certainly to my taste,just loved it.  There are plenty of comfortable areas to sit in  throughout the hotel to relax.  We enjoyed every minute of our stay.  The food was very enjoyable,a great variety and quality.We had dinner in the terrace and could not fault it ,the restaurant manager was exceptional ,so sorry I cant remember his name.  The bedroom was decorated tastefully and bathroom was spotless. I would like AC in room but I know its an old hotel.  The staff throughout the hotel were exceptional .I sat watching them and the care and interest they showed their guests was a joy to behold. i was particulary impressed with a member of staff and how she interacted with a mother with 2 autistc children,all I can say is she wore dark rimmed glasses,so sorry I dont know her name.  I could go on  but as you can see I was extremely happy so my advice is to book it as soon as you can for a guaranteed enjoyable stay",5,2022,11,03
218,Poor service and non existent management,"Problems with checking for my part, one had to wait until 4:00 to get into room, one double booked.
Don’t bother having a wedding here unless you want to endure a nearly 4 hour meal
Don’t expect to have your room cleaned every day or your complementary tea/ coffee replaced at all
Expect to have your breakfast tea / coffee order get confused on most days
Be careful if you’re a vegetarian as the hotel thinks gluten-free is the same thing
Gardens and decor were brilliant though",2,2022,11,03
218,Very very average for a four star,"Ok I’m going to try and be as honest as I can with this review.  On first impressions driving into the hotel grounds in the evening it really did look beautiful but unfortunately that was the best part.

Check in was ok staff not overly friendly and couldn’t have got the payment off us any quicker.

The hotel was very much catered for the two weddings that were on that weekend. There was nowhere for us to sit and enjoy a drink as it was taken up all afternoon by wedding guests ( not their fault) We were also feeling peckish late afternoon absolutely nothing to be found not even a bag of peanuts or taytos behind the bar. The snug was closed ( wedding) the butterfly garden was closed (wedding). We decided to have dinner in the bistro on the first evening but were totally forgotten about we eventually got a table at 20.45 (not acceptable) the staff are extremely young and very inexperienced ( again not their fault).

The following day after being out for the day we came home to find our room left open after the cleaners ( who did not clean) left. We reported this to reception to be told oh yeah you have to pull that door quite hard ( surely the staff should
Know this) this resulted in both key cards not working and having to walk what felt like miles twice to reception.

That evening we had a meal in the terrace. We weren’t  told of any any specials we only found out after our meal as we heard the couple next to us being told. 

I know it is a family hotel which is lovely as I have four children myself but I think there should be a curfew for when they should be gone from the lounge area. Running around in your pyjamas at 9.30 at night isn’t very fair on guests without children. 

Breakfast was quite good and managed to get a table quite quickly without a long wait.

Event for a treatment before leaving which was fabulous and the best part of the weekend.

It’s actually such a shame as this could be a fabulous hotel but unfortunately a lot of improvement is needed. ",2,2022,11,02
218,One of the best places ever!,"This is one of the most special places you could choose to spend some time. The staff are amazing, the food is consistently of a high standard. It's so warm and welcoming and it's somewhere you can totally get away from the business of life. ",5,2022,11,02
218,A fine place,"I went there for Halloween break, it was good value at 280€ for a family of four, BB1D. The rooms were top notch and reception super friendly.
Food ok, no major complaints, although it wasn't delicious. 
Some things for kids did not quite work for us (kids age 4 and 7)
Halloween movie Hocus Pocus 2 for teenagers, not that age group. A lot of school age kids left during movie, it is recommended from the age of 12.
Zip line in playground broken. Not great, it was advertised as one of amenities for family Halloween break.
Playroom again: looks very nice, but many toys broken, or no batteries.
Swimming pool clean, good facilities, but not for us, as it was EXTREMELY LOUD with music at classes. Noodles / boards as swimming aids not at poolside, you had to ask reception, and then ask fitness instructor, so you were interrupting class. Classes were on 10/11, so not handy to avoid, as it just suits after breakfast/ before check out. The place needs a bit more love and practical prep if it is meant to be good for kids age 2-10. I'd say it is good for adults and babies. 
Garden well kept, but butterfly house no real butterflies, like in Malahide, just a wooden playhouse with plastic butterflies as decoration.
I wouldn't rush back, but can see it is a good venue for weddings etc, as it is elegant, spacious, and close to Dublin.",4,2022,11,02
218,Beautiful hotel,We stayed at kilashee as part of.our honeymoon. The hotel very kindly upgraded us to their suite because of this. We had champagne and chocolates waiting on arrival which I found a very classy gesture fro. The hotel. Staff were excellent ,5,2022,11,02
218,Great staff,"Fabulous, professional and  effecient staff, who despite being very busy with two weddings, did their work calmly and effectively, in particular the check in staff.its always great to be greeted by friendly effecint staff 
 Rooms are spacious very comfortable with exceptionally crisp high end linen. My only reservation was the dinner... ham and chicken terrine was very dry, confit of duck a bit disappointing & mash very dry. I would put dinner down to a once of and not deter from staying or recomrmding this great hotel  ",5,2022,11,01
218,Fabulous spa experience and top class afternoon tea,"We booked the spa and afternoon tea package , it was brilliant value the massges were excellent and it was a real treat. We asked for firm massages and the both girls we got were amazing !We then went on to our afternoon tea which was top class everything was 6 star !! Martina and Siobhan were serving and they couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. The staff are just brilliant its to see such welcoming friendly Irish staff around the hotel . We felt really looked after. We've had afternoon tea in other 5 star hotels and this is the best one we've had. Thank you for a lovely day.",5,2022,10,31
218,"Fabulous food, excellent service","We were married in the Killashee Hotel in August 2021 and returned for a night away to celebrate our first anniversary. We had dinner in the restaurant in the evening, and it was simply excellent. We were both very impressed by the standard of service. At a time when the world is short staffed, our time in the hotel was a real treat. From the moment we arrived at reception, nothing was any trouble at all. We were even upgraded to a suite as an anniversary gift, which was a lovely touch. We will be back! :)",5,2022,10,28
218,Exceptional.,This was a very last minute stay. I was greeted like a friend. Everyone was American level friendly and light hearted. Room service was on point. Food was exceptional - I mean REALLY good. Massive room and bathroom. Comfortable bed and pillows. Elemis products. Great price. Masses of parking. It really was faultless.,5,2022,10,28
218,Great Time in the Killashee,"Had a surprisingly great stay in Killashee. Location, staff and food all great plus rooms very functional. Breakfast outstanding and there was a bit of life about the place when having a drink later that night. ",5,2022,10,26
218,1 Night B & B Stay after Wedding,"We really enjoyed our visit and the food during the wedding was amazing. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for everyone!
Breakfast was lovely, we were disappointed that we didn't get to visit the spa, but we will on our next visit!
10 out of 10!",5,2022,10,25
218,A GOOD TEAM MAKES YOU FEEL YOUR ARE AT HOME,Having stayed at the Killashee Hotel for many years i would like to commend Olivia and all the breakfast team for their friendly welcome each morning and the level of service that they provide is one of the best i have ever had in all my years of travel to different locations and Hotels.  I would also like to mention Glen in the restaurant who has always given me a great level of customer service and noting is too much trouble and Louise and Megan in reception who are always helpful.,5,2022,10,24
218,Fabulous hotel with great facilities!,"I recently stayed at the Killashee hotel with a group of friends and I was extremely impressed! Our room was very spacious with lovely decor and furniture. The room was spotless and the beds were very comfortable to sleep in. The food at dinner and breakfast was excellent and reasonably priced. The facilities at the hotel were also great and we used the Hydropool and the sauna in the morning. In addition the staff were very helpful, friendly and accommodating which was the cherry on top of an excellent stay! I would definitely recommend the hotel to people considering visiting. ",5,2022,10,24
218,excellent,"I stayed in this hotel saturday , from the very first staff member i met whom checked me in to manjeet the manager whom i met when checking out where highly professional and very efficient,  the room in the old house was perfect , we ate in the terrace restaurant and the meal was exquisite to say the very least , staff in the restaurant where attentive ,  but the best part was the breakfast on sunday , i have been to many hotels and this was by far the best breakfast i ever had. orange juice tasted as it was fresh from the orange , perfectly grilled smoked bacon , well sourced sausages and perfectly cooked eggs , when i was checking out manjeet introduced himself to me and asked how was my stay,  and offered to help with my bags , this hotel is going places fast , there is not many that can match this service and detail , ",5,2022,10,24
218,Lovely food and Very accommodating staff,My girlfriend and myself had breakfast here recently and the food was lovely. Also the staff and manager Olivia if I remember correctly were very accommodating and polite. I will definitely back again.,5,2022,10,24

Good quality breakfast.A busy hotel which is a good sign!

218,Honeymoon,We had the best time and were so pleased with the incredible service! The staff was so kind and helpful making it such an amazing experience. The hotel is stunning surrounded by breath taking grounds. We can't wait to go back one day!,5,2022,10,21
218,"Killashee Hotel, not there just yet!","We stayed overnight in the Killashee Hotel. 
The public areas are very nice, and the breakfast was really good.
The check- in and check-out was efficient.
Unfortunately the Junior Suite we stayed in was really really tired. The furniture was very worn and old, not antique, just well past it sell by date, and dilapidated.
The junior suite was spacious, but hollow. Large areas with nothing in it.....only space....
The TV .... ?  What can I say about the TV? I did not think these TV's still existed. They went out in the Middle Ages.
I know the hotel has been purchased by FBD, and they are going to renovate, but I can only rate the suite on how it was, on how Killashee Hotel sold it to us, and it was not good or pretty..
The lay- out of the hotel is strange to say the least. I read on line that many people got lost, needed a road map etc etc and I thought , 'surely this is exaggerated?'. No it was not. The lay out is mind boggling. We had to walk with our suitcases to our Junior Suite through lounge and bar areas where people were relaxing and having drinks. Very strange and rather uncomfortable. 
Public areas very nice, and the drive up to the hotel very nice indeed.",3,2022,10,21
218,A true hidden Gem ,"They say first impressions count, and in this instance this is absolutely the case. From the moment you enter the gates, you're greeted with luxury and attention to detail.  The meticulously trimmed hedges and gardens are a beautiful welcome, and as are the staff when you arrive. They were charming, friendly and beyond helpful, pandering to every whim. The room itself was finished to the highest of standards, and clean and relaxing. The spa was a dream and food was delicious. One hidden gem was the gardens themselves, full of historical vignettes and excellent photo opportunities. 
I would recommend to anyone looking for a staycation.  ",5,2022,10,20
218,A relaxing time in a beautiful hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed at Killashee and had a great time! Our room was in the original manor house, so 
we had a taste of Victorian style (and modern comfort). While we didn't have time to roam the grounds, they looked
absolutely stunning. We did manage to take in the leisure centre, where we easily unwound. The staff were
wonderful. Without exception, everyone was friendly and paused for a chat. Killashee has the right balance between
friendliness and absolute professionalism. We will certainly be back. Thank you!",5,2022,10,20
218,First and last,"Never do it again. Service was poor from the moment of arrival. Endless hallways, frustrating layout. Poor comparison the similar properties we’ve stayed at in Ireland. The noise level in the public areas weren’t conducive to socialized.",2,2022,10,19
218,Amazing,"From the first step to the check out, killashee does not disappoint. The hotel looks amazing, especially the bistro. We were looked after in every detail. Will definitely be back for more ! 
Thank you for such amazing experience to all staff.",5,2022,10,19
218,A experience worth remembering ,"One word…AMAZING. From the room, the spa, the staff (in particular Nazir & Olivia at breakfast) and the food! Would definitely recommend to anyone considering staying. For anyone looking for a relaxing staycation look no further!",5,2022,10,19
218,The killashee experience,"What can i  say about killashee hotel,considering i work and stay in lot of hotel, killashee is a amazing place to stay,the rooms that have just been newly refurbished are so  outstanding and comfortable to stay in,bar and restaurant/breakfast food is  just mouth watering ,the grounds itself has loads to offer ,playground for the kids ,lovely romantic walks,leisure and spa are just top,overall its just a beautiful hotel to stay in ...the hotel staff couldn't do enough for us ,just so welcome and friendly, made our stay feel so homely ,definitely will be back again",5,2022,10,19

218,Family hotel,Me and my family stayed in Killashee hotel for 2 nights. I had the most amazing experience. We were greeted by Elizabeth at the reception. She had the most fun personality that just adds to how pleasant and helpful she was. Checking in was easy and quick then we ere directed to our rooms which were bright and had just been renovated. The kids loved the playground and the playroom provided. Our night in the bistro cannot be matched. We had a great waitress who's name was Carys who knew exactly what we wanted from the moment we sat down. She explained the menu had recently been changed along with the refurbishment of the hotel. The staff were always with a smile and I can not compliment enough Nazir the manager of the Bistro Bar who was looking after us through out our stay in both nights. Thank you Killashee. We will definitely set it as our family destination.,5,2022,10,18
218,Special stay,"Lovely well kept grounds, very nice hotel with charm and opulence.  Need more time there to use facilities.  Next time we want to stay two nights.  Very comfortable and relaxing stay, just what we needed.  Breckfast was very well received and included with room price, bathroom had a jacuzzi, it was so nice.",5,2022,10,18
218,Killashee 5 star hotel,I recently stayed in the hotel for one night. It has been a number of years since I last stayed and it’s great to see some refurbishment works happening to bring new life to the hotel. The staff were friendly across all areas and the food in the bar and for breakfast was delightful. Would gladly recommend this hotel for a stay. ,5,2022,10,18

218,A new look worked ,"Been a while since I stayed here and was surprised by the new look. It's had a full facelift and looks like lots of money was spent making much needed improvements to the heneral feel and loom of the place.
The whole experience was anazing abd the massage in the spa was really relaxing. 
The only minor disappointment was the walk outsude to get to the leisure centre hasn't been fixed yet.
Food was good but a little slow to get to us but the young guy serving us was a realky nice guy.
Overall we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed our stay and the whole staff made the friendly atmosphere enjoyable.",5,2022,10,18
218,A haven close to Mondello,We stayed with the kids for one night and enjoyed every minute of our stay. The leisure centre has fabulous facilities. The service was amazing. All staff from reception to cleaners to waiters were very attentive and friendly. The room had superb view. The garden is like a mini Powerscourt and offers a great haven for the kids to run around. Delighted with our break away after experiencing the thrills of nearby Mondello track ,5,2022,10,18
218,Autum break,Stayed  last weekend and as much as the hotel was so busy we still felt in the countryside with our  window view of the gardens the amazing staff all over the hotel  the front desk team truly amazing from the the assistant receptionist’s mgr Liz and her team to the bistro staff and great manager Nasir. We had an amazing night and will be back 100 % for everything see you soon,5,2022,10,17
218,A Rising Star.,This hotel aims high and is on course to become a rising star. Rooms very comfortable but colour palette somewhat cold. Staff excellent and wear their uniform with pride. Grounds and interior of hotel spotless.,4,2022,10,17
218,Recommend for a couple getaway,"One of the nicest hotels we have stayed in, in Ireland for a couples getaway. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. You could tell the room was freshly cleaned. Breakfast was well made and delicious. Definetily recommend.",5,2022,10,17

218,Worth a stay,We both enjoyed our stay here. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful when needed. The new refurbishment was welcoming. The room we stayed in was spacious and clean. Pretty much everything you want from a hotel on a weekend break. Bar was nice ,5,2022,10,16
218,Relaxing,Wonderful relaxing stay in Killashee .Did not want to leave my comfy gorgeous bedroom.When I managed to drag myself out it was beautiful to walk and enjoy all of the Autumn colours around the grounds .,5,2022,10,16
218,Lovey weekend away,I stayed with my partner for a weekend away and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The room was beautiful and spotless. The staff in the bedroom corridors were friendly especially a lady called Victoria I believe she was the manager. Thank you we had a lovely weekend!,5,2022,10,16
218,"Don’t bother booking, spend your money elsewhere","I stayed here recently with my boyfriend. The hotel stay overall was awful. I havent got one good thing to say about the hotel, the service, the cleanliness and the rooms were all shocking. The spa and the dinner in the restaurant were fab but not enough to make us return. Spend your money elsewhere. ",1,2022,10,15
218,Beautifully Refurbished,"My husband and I recently returned to stay here for 2 nights and can not recommend the place enough. We originally stayed back in spring of 2019 so we were blown away by all the recent work that has been done. 
From the moment you arrive you are looked after. We had dinner in the Bistro on our first and then the Terrace on our second night. Both meals were delicious and the staff were incredibly attentive. 
Thank you Killashee, we will be back.",5,2022,10,11
218,"Beautiful hotel with lovely grounds, friendly and helpful staff , delicious food and great facilities. Highly recommend.","Visited this lovely hotel last Thursday with my partner for one night, the only regret is that we didn’t stay longer , can’t wait to revisit. 
From the moment we checked in until the time we checked out . 
We couldn’t fault a thing.
Receptionist on check in very friendly and helpful and explained everything to us . 
Got to our bedroom which was lovely and spacious and spotless clean . 
Decided to have some food in the main bar ( The Bistro) , from food to service we could not fault a thing . Well done to the chefs , mouthwatering bar menu, next time we visit we definitely will try the restaurant for sure .
After the meal we decided to go for a walk and explore the grounds of  the hotel to walk off the fullness from the lovely food we had in the bar , beautiful grounds and trails/ walkway around the hotel . 
After the walk we came back to the bar for some
Lovely cocktails which were very nice .
Breakfast the next morning was outstanding and plenty to choose from the cold buffet and the hot breakfast was very tasty and again outstanding service from the breakfast staff . 
After the breakfast we had spa treatments booked in and have to say one of the best treatments we had in a long time and again very friendly and helpful staff in all departments.
On checkout we got in talking to the general manager Ger I think is his name who was in the lobby and happened to ask us , how our stay was .
He informed us that the hotel was recently taking over by FBD hotel group and that they are in the middle of some changes. 
Very well done to Ger and all the team at Kilashee hotel , one
Of the best hotel experiences we’ve had in a long time.
Highly recommend this hotel for any occasions or gatherings.
Keep up the good work and looking forward to revisiting again very soon.

218,Lunch out with my lovely mam,"Had lovely last lunch at kilashee bistro last sat.  A treat for me & mam.  We were delighted with our food. The fish chips were delicious, duck salad was so tasty.  Our waitress Katie was really helpful and friendly.  She looked after everyone really well.  Enjoyed food in lovely venue.",5,2022,09,09
218,Not a good visit,The hotel staff were great BUT we had to go through a work site complete with carpenters painters and work men just to reach our room!! My mum was in a wheelchair &  we were put  on  the 3rd floor down dark and badly signed corridors we had to ask for a fridge for my mums meds none in the room  the shower is in the bath again NOT easily assessable my Mum couldn't shower we did ask for a wheelchair assessable room by email .  But they didn't have the email however the Irish Wheelechair Association were there on the 2nd night ...I wonder was it overbooked ..... the room service was passable however they did forget sugar  ...   the leisure centre is NOT attached to the hotel and not easily assessable so be prepared to walk through a car park area.  Would definitely NOT recommend this hotel to anyone with mobility issues no automatic doors it was difficult to get the wheelchair in and out of the room and the hotel ... Not a good experience over all,2,2022,09,07
218,Nice hotel but not for families with babies,Loft was not working (but was warned ahead of time still a hassle with baby and 7 months pregnant). Couldn’t  order porridge in evening for baby as it’s only gotten at breakfast. No fridge after requesting it. Not really family/baby friendly.,3,2022,09,04
218,A lovely stay bar a few issues..,"A lovely stay but there was some issues. On check in the young girl was so lovely and so down to earth. She did tell us we got upgraded to a suite but when we arrived into our room (141) it most certainly wasn’t a suite. 
The view was the car park but for one night that didn’t bother us as such. When using the hairdryer we quickly had to turn it off due to it what can only be described a lawnmower sound and it kept glitching when we went to use it. At 7:30am the next morning we were woken up by drilling noise. I appreciate an email was sent out to alert guests about minor reservations but there was nothing to say that they would be commencing right beside room allocations or that early in the morning. The breakfast line took a while but I can appreciate that post Covid times staffing is tough but I have to say all the staff played a blinder. These are minor issues that can be rectified but at the moment it wouldn’t encourage me to visit the property while it’s under construction",3,2022,08,31
218,After the races.,"
We headed to Kilashee after attending The Curragh races.
When I say from start to finish was an amazing experience please believe me.  The menu was very comprehensive and all the staff were so informed about it.  Service was very prompt and at all time courteous.
In particular the Food and Beverage Manager Paul Berry was brilliant.  ",5,2022,08,28
218,Poor service,We as a family did not feel welcome at all. Our suite was disappointing as for amenities and properness. Also the staff at the restaurant was not nice at all. Our room was not cleaned properley and there was alot of noise and dust from an ongoing construction.,2,2022,08,26
218,Wonderful,Just back from Killnashee having availed of the over 50's package. Fantastic value for money. We received a complimentary upgrade to a house suite which was brilliant and a real treat. Thank you so much and can't wait to return. A special mention to the staff..  all so welcoming and polite. Thank you.,5,2022,08,25
218,Opulent and Family Friendly,Beautiful hotel with attention too detail in all areas. Staff were very  friendly and polite also. Lots too do for children and gardens were well maintained. I have highly recommended too both family and friends.,5,2022,08,25
218,Fantastic Hotel!,"Just back from a fabulous weekend. The hotel is beautiful and fabulous grounds. A warm welcome from all the staff. Always greeted with a smile. The hotel was very busy with weddings but nothing was to much trouble for staff . A special mention to the younger staff members, super friendly and efficient,  they are a credit to the hotel. Room was excellent. Food was amazing in both bistro and terrace restaurant.  Highly recommend a stay.  We cannot wait to go back!",5,2022,08,21
218,Can't wait to go back ,"Fantastic Hotel
We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful hotel, 
We ate in the newly opened Bistro , the atmosphere was really nice and the food was out of this world , we had the steak and the fish , which was gorgeous, 
I will go back to this hotel just to have the coconut dessert it was amazing!!
We visited the spa where we spent time in the relaxing pool and I highly recommend a massage from the amazing Amy in the spa , I floated out of the room she was brilliant 😊",5,2022,08,20
218,Highly recommend,"Myself, husband and two young daughters stayed in this hotel for two nights last weekend. We had a wonderful stay and the children had a ball. The staff are so helpful and courteous, I would highly recommend for both a couples get away or family trip! Thank you to all for a lovely experience!",5,2022,08,15
218,Killashee the hidden pleasure,"What a venue from check in to check out the staff and venue where excellent. This four star hotel offers a very family friendly atmosphere while still having locations for quiet reflective drinks in the snug and in the upstairs lounge area. The bistro bar was under renovation which was a tad bit disappointing but the service and food in the restaurant well made up for it.One special point to note was the very young servers in the restaurant deserve special mention as it is difficult enough to get this age group into the hospitality industry these young lads and ladies where fantastic nothing was too big a request and they where so professional in their approach and attentive they deserve mention. The exquisite gardens have to be seen to be believed and we also had our grand children over for a night so they loved the clean sagged play area. The pool and  spa again a valuable addition to family stay.Well done killashee as the saying goes ""I'll be back""",5,2022,08,10
218,Very nice hotel,Killashee Hotel is a lovely hotel with a great fitness center and pool.  The food was excellent.  The staff was good.  The hotel was fully booked and we had a handicapped room which we did not like.  The room was comfortable and clean.,5,2022,08,09
218,"Overall a beautiful hotel with excellent staff,food could be a little better but that’s the only constructive criticism","Overall a lovely experience only a few elements dropping it to a 4/5 . 
The exterior of the hotel is beautiful and really well cared for and maintained. There was a very ling queue for check in so we were offered complimentary tea/coffee while we stood in the queue which was a lovely touch. 
The lifts are a little confusing to and from the rooms as some lifts only operate to the rooms themselves so trying to get back to reception/dining can be awkward, we ended up just getting out at one point and taking the stairs. The restaurant/breakfast area is beautiful, the staff are efficient and attentive and very pleasant. The evening dinner menu we both felt lacked , neither one of us is a fussy eater but we struggled to pick something for mains … I chose risotto but unfortunately it lacked flavour at all and was like very basic boiled oats (like basic porridge) , I am a big risotto fan usually but this was really disappointing . My husband ordered the steak and said it was just ok . The desserts were nice however . 
We had a walk around the gardens which were really lovely and then went to the upstairs bar , there was a band playing which were very good and the atmosphere there was nice and relaxed and comfortable. 
The bedroom was really lovely , the beds were comfortable , a nice strong shower and a jacuzzi bath , there was a nespresso machine in the room but unfortunately it was broken but if working would have been a lovely addition , I’m sure it’s hard to keep track that they’re working in each room at all times . 
The staff throughout were really excellent , the atmosphere lovely , the building itself is beautiful, the room is well decorated and comfy and the breakfast was delicious !! The only negatives for us were the evening meal , the lifts and as mentioned the coffee machine being ooo , would not deter me from going back at all, we had a lovely stay overall and will definitely be back in the future .",4,2022,08,08
218,Amazing,"Stayed for 2 nights family weekend and cannot wait to return.
Staff were incredibly kind and couldn't do enough.
Food was fab.
The music upstairs was great and a lovely touch with the board games!
I had a massage with Amy in the spa.
I have one in every spa I stay in and it was one of the most fantastic massages I have ever had.
Thank you Amy, you are amazing!!! 
I never write reviews but I really felt I had to, thank you so much to all the staff for making our stay so perfect.",5,2022,08,08
218,Casual visit for dinner,"As a local to the Kilashee we went to the hotel for dinner on Saturday since we heard it is been renovated. The dinner selection is very small. The food was okay and the chips very undercooked. 

Understandably the bar area is not open due to the renovations and to have a drink after the meal we had to go to the upstairs bar. There was a single musician there and the volume was unbearable. Had one drink and left. 

Passing the reception we tried to explain to the receptionist that the music was way too loud. We had to explain this twice, the second time shouting, as she could not hear what we were saying due to the loudness of the music. 

Such a shame it has so much potential. Unless the food changes and the music is less loud we would not be back or recommend the Kilashee to anyone.",2,2022,08,08
218,Dula family,"Room was beautiful, staff very friendly. Hazel looked after us, she was very good. Beautiful views at Killashee Hotel. Nice food at the restaurant and live music at the terrace. Very pleasant stay. Really enjoyed.",5,2022,08,03
218,Worth a Visit,"Just back from a weekend at Killashee Hotel. A lovely setting, nice garden walks around the hotel. The hotel is a labyrith inside. Corridors and rooms all over the place.
Nice bar with entertainment at night. If you prefer something quieter, the Snug bar is an old Irish themed pub.
We ate 2 nights in the restaurant. Food was very good.
Breakfast was excellent, food always fresh, nothing left standing for ling periods as you can get elsewhere.
Staff are fantastic, friendly, never pass you without saying hello. Very efficient, nothingbtoo much trouble. If lost around hotel, they will bring you to that area.
Good leisure centre and Spa.
Spectacular staircase in reception that leads upstairs.
Room are big, 2 double beds. One each wherevyou can lie and do the Star. Rooms well stocked with shampoos and conditioners, tea, coffee etc.
Close to Kildare village, and Newbridge Silver Icon museum.
Overall a very nice hotel to spend a weekend.
One downside, rooms do not have air conditioning  when it is hot, the rooms are hot. 
But that is a minor issue.",5,2022,08,02
218,A late afternoon family lunch,"Omg what a transformation to this property from 6mths ago . Fresh refurb to all public areas and dining  . We had a late family lunch with our 2kids at 3:30pm . Staff where warm and engaging and welcoming. Food was great a huge step up from our visit at Christmas. Staff where checking our needs and top ups with us and all tables. My son saw cocktails been served to adults and decided he wishes for kids version moktail for his desert and was very impressed, Sinead operations manger was checking tables and bistro manger Glenn was super engaging and atissapating guests needs before they requested - top marks . All the younger staff had a purpose and where organised compared to previous visit where they where having little chats and inattentive to guests needs.A  Huge change to the property - Top marks to new owners & management.excellent standards & service & product . And a great athmoshere in hotel",5,2022,07,31
218,Lovely grand hotel,"I stayed at the Killashee for a couple of nights and the hotel is very comfortable. The bed room was large with a coffee maker. There was a big en suite with shower and bath. All very clean. The carpets were a bit marked and the furniture uninspiring, but there was a mahoosive TV. 
I eat at the restaurant on the second night and the food was good and a great pint of Guinness.
One odd thing was that the room wasn’t made up on the second day, so you have to do it yourself.",4,2022,07,25
218,"Fantastic Venue, Highly Recommend","Stayed here two weeks ago with my family. Would highly recommend. Playground onsite, children's swimming pool plus a family changing room which is always appreciated. 

Little goodie bag on check in for the girls and staff were so friendly. 

Loads to do in the all within a 20min drive too.",5,2022,07,21
218,"Perfect place to relax, unwind and reconnect with friends - Killashee Hotel","What an amazing place! I had the best time away with friends recently at Killashee Hotel. We got a fantastic deal that included a spa treatment, dinner and breakfast.

The spa experience helped all of us relax and unwind, while dinner hit every tastebud! The food was presented so beautifully, you cant help but take pictures before eating every bite.

Breakfast was just as tasty and afterwards we took a stroll around the grounds - stunning! 

I can't fault the service and the staff were so, so lovely.

I read it was taken over by FBD and already some great refurb work on it so I'm interested to see what will be done in the future.

We enjoyed it so much that we've already booked our next stay!",5,2022,07,20
218,Lovely Stay,"Hotel undergoing refurbishment at present, new ownership.  Just back from stay at this hotel, have stayed here on numerous occasions before this and always enjoyed our stay.  Staff were very courteous, friendly and well trained, well done to all.  Any requests at reservation were carried out efficiently. Nice welcome pack for birthday celebration. Food very good it would be nice to see some stir fry dishes on the menu.  Looking forward to staying again.",4,2022,07,20
218,Fabulous first stop stay,"Fabulous first stay at Killashee. Weather was great and we were able to see the gardens and have a picnic. Had dinner each night in both restaurants. The hotel was busy had a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The service and attentiveness from all the staff was fantastic from reception, bar, restaurant and service staff. Kids enjoyed the pool, the outside and inside play areas. Even asked where the Christmas trees are placed as would love to return in December!",5,2022,07,13
218,The absolute worst hotel experience i’ve ever had,"09-7-22 arrived at hotel around 3pm 
the grounds are very nice and also the outside of the house 
But that’s where it ends .
This Hotel is in no way a 4 star 

The walk to hotel rooms is very confusing and very difficult to navigate you must 2 lifts when they are working or servers stairs. 

The hallways are very dated the carpets tread bare is some parts 

The rooms are very much the same really old and to be honest quit dirty with spider webs around the lights 

the meal in the terrace was really poor and the menu choices where as bad 
it was like the chef just made up the menus that day of what ever he or she had left in the kitchen it was shockingly bad.

after the meal we returned to our room as there was no where to sit in the bar as there was wedding in the hotel taking over every corner 
at approx 9 pm the wedding  entertainment started until 2am it was so loud in our room it was unbearable i rang a couple of times to reception but nothing was done 

we paid €360 for b&b and €140 for the meal incl a bottle of wine 

we feel that the hotel shouldn’t have taken our booking considering they had a wedding that size in the hotel 

overall it’s was a terrible experience.",1,2022,07,11
218,Underwhelming,"This hotel was underwhelming. The initial look of it is a country house hotel, which is what I expected. But the minute you walk away from reception and to your room ( which is so far away and you have to go through two lifts, one of which does not have the correct levels signage’s and is just plain confusing, you are in what is just an average looking hotel, like the Clayton. The room was pleasant but the beds were not made properly and it was not the cleanest, which can be said for the lobby areas too, the carpet is old and dirty. 

Robyn the waitress at dinner was wonderful and extremely helpful. The food was ok but nothing I would be rushing back to. 

The breakfast staff were extremely inattentive, the waiter forgot to give my order to the kitchen, never came back to give me an update when I asked where it was, it finally came out but missing my side order, when I said this to the waitress it was like I was asking her the most difficult thing in the world and made me feel like I was making her go out of her way, wasn’t a good experience and the breakfast staff could do with some general customer service training overall. 

This hotel is fine if you’re looking for an average family time away, but if you want a relaxing country house type of experience, this is not it.",3,2022,07,11
218,Average - for above average cost.,"Hotel gardens are stunning, and 10/10 to the team responsible for that. 

The initial impression the hotel is really good. Unfortunately, once beyond reception, the combination of lifts (quite old) and stairs becomes bothersome. Stayed in room 123, which was as far away from the main hotel as you can get. 

Decor in rooms was average, but the carpets throughout the hotel could certainly do with some attention (or regular cleaning). Two rusty screws in the wall of the shower were a very dangerous oversight - a fall against them would be very dangerous. 

We ate in the Bistro. The staff were very helpful, attentive and professional. The food was slightly underwhelming.

Overall, a pleasant enough stay - if they could match the food and rooms to the ambiance of the main public areas and gardens, it would be top class. 

We paid 310 for dinner B&B for 3 people (2A 1C), plus 70 euro extra for some wine, drinks and coffee. Didn’t feel that it was value for money, given some of the shortcomings.",3,2022,07,05
218,Good,"Beautiful hotel, staff could not do enough for us, but the bistro dinner was a let down, it was as if it was reheated, my dinner had to be sent back as it was cold, when I got it back some of the veg was missing, And we got a wake up call at 4 am which we didn’t ask for 🥴",4,2022,07,03
218,Stairs?????,Found it very difficult to get to my room because of having to climb the stairs to my bedroom which was 285.    Also would have been  safer for me to have a separate shower.  There was only a bath with a shower in it.  No anti-slip mat in the bath either.,5,2022,06,28
218,Race weekend,"Nice hotel and good food. Only stayed one night as were attending the Curragh races. 
Nice spacious rooms and staff helpful. 
Used leisure facilities on Sunday. Pool very busy but had nice sauna and jacuzzi
Enjoyed the stay.",4,2022,06,28
218,Family wedding,"Stated at the hotel for 3 nights for a family wedding. Everything about the hotel was excellent, stayed in the old wing (original house), rooms are lovely and extremely well maintained. 

The wedding itself was faultless, excellent food, plenty of staff, all of whom appeared to have been well trained & no shortage of drink which is always important at any wedding! The lady responsible for running the wedding events (Marian) was exceptional — would consider booking the place myself if I decide to get married again!!! 

We ate in the bar food as well on a couple of occasions, excellent choice.

Would have no hesitation in.recommending the place.",5,2022,06,26
218,Break away,Very disappointing.  Nowhere near 4 star ...cleanliness poor service poor and food barely average. Has the potential to be 4 star but a long way off it at present  which is a shame for such a grand building in a good location,2,2022,06,26
218,Great place to be jet-lagged.,"The staff was attentive, professional, and friendly. The estate has huge trees, beautiful gardens, and our room was comfortable.  The hotel has a very good restaurant but we also enjoyed walking into Naas for the pubs, several good restaurants in town. The only reason I sod not give a 5 rating was that our mattress was a bit old and flimsy. We would definitely go back.",4,2022,06,24
218,Excellent stay at Killashee,"I stayed in Killashee Hotel for one night last week for work.  The room was very spacious, nicely decorated and comfortable. The staff were very professional, warm and friendly. The food was delicious.",5,2022,06,24
218,"Their priority is weddings, not a good night’s sleep","This hotel’s priority is to cater to weddings, not the regular traveler. They allow the bands to play very loud music until 2 am. This happened on 2 out of 3 of our nights (Friday & Saturday). If you are an early or light sleeper don’t consider this hotel.",2,2022,06,19
218,Exemplary,"My wife and I spent the day here as walk-in visitors.  We used the spa, cafe and bistro throughout the day, The spa was very relaxing and we thoroughly enjoyed the food. However, the quality which struck us most was the service. The staff were excellent. They could not have been better. I booked my wife into the spa for treatment, then went for my own two hours later. As I came out of my own treatment I went past the girl who had been there at 09.30 ( four hours before ) but hadn't been seen since. She greeted me by my first name and asked if we had enjoyed our stay. There are places who barely acknowledge you as staff chat amongst themselves. My example here shows how it should be done. You are treated as a guest but also as a person. Exemplary.",5,2022,06,16
218,Hosting a company retreat or meeting?,"We booked our company all hands meeting at Killashee. I knew from the first phone call I had with Lisa Kelly that we would be in good hands as we planned and executed our bi-annual meeting. 
The grounds are breath-taking and the hotel offers many activities for guests. ",5,2022,06,13
218,The Killashee is awesome,Everything went well and the whole staff was really kind. The food was good. They have a pub inside of the hotel that was amazing. They have a shuffle that helps people to get to the airport that departs from the entrance of the hotel.,5,2022,06,12
218,Short stay,"A good clean well managed hotel, with excellent staff and a great leisure centre as well. Lots of nice gardens to wander around. Close to Kildare village and Newbridge. Lots of seating areas around the hotel playing nice background music which we found very relaxing.",5,2022,06,05
218,Family time,"The newly refurbished hotel is stunning, set on thr most beautiful grounds. Our little one had a wonderful time running around and even enjoyed a swim in the leisure suite.

The leisure suite is still slightly outdated but has a pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna.

Overall a lovely time",4,2022,06,05
218,Family wedding ,Great stay for a family wedding. Staff were excellent. Special mention to Kate at breakfast service. She was very helpful. Rooms were very spacious and spotlessly clean. Food was gorgeous and warm. Garden space really made a difference especially as it was a lovely warm sunny day. ,5,2022,06,04
218,Fantastic Hotel for Family Celebration,We celebrated a family event in Kilashee Hotel.  We had dinner in the bistro and stayed overnight.  We had a large group of adults and kids.  The staff looked after us very well.  The food was great and was very reasonably priced.  The hotel room was clean and spacious and was very good value.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.,5,2022,06,04
218,Enjoyable experience,"Excellent staff and ambience. Convenient location to Kildare and within close proximity to Dublin
Enjoyed the sense of history of the place and the lovely gardens It was crowded on occasion but well managed and obviously very popular",4,2022,06,02
218,Beautiful country house hotel,Beautiful visit for a family gathering. Highly recommend. Staff were lovely and gardens are worth a walk around! Food and drink selection was good and had a lovely meal. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Loved it!,4,2022,06,01
218,Trip Review,"Stunning hotel and grounds. Staff very friendly and food was excellent. I would recommend a walk around the ground should you visit as there are so many hidden stunning areas around the grounds. Only negative would be the layout of the hotel itself, getting to the rooms if carrying large amount of luggage difficult.",5,2022,05,31
218,Wedding Venue,"Luxurious surroundings, friendly staff, excellent food. The bedrooms are very spacious and tastefully decorated. The addition of drinking water and chocolates is a nice personal touch. There are lots of recreational areas to relax in, both indoor and outdoor.",5,2022,05,30
218,Going to a wedding,"I was at the killashee for a wedding,
On arrival with my wheelchair bound wife
I searched for a disabled toilet, after being told it was downstairs, i found a door marked for Men and a door marked for women.
I went back to reception where i was directed down a corridor and the toilet was just marked toilet, with no bars either side. I again went back to reception to be told that the disabled toilet was in a cubicle in the ladies toilet. Does Tourism Ireland not check before awarding 4 stars, to my knowledge disabled toilets should be seperate. They gave me my room key early to get me away from reception.
The food and food service really great but did not provide bar service waiting staff, 4 star??? You went to the bar which was on the dance floor, navigated your way through dancers without spilling your drinks or dropping glasses. Health and safety doesn't seem to be a concern. The Rooms are nice and clean and  comfortable but very spread out. I have been in the service industry for over 40 years. This was my second and last time here. Sadly let down, no wow factor.

218,Fantastic!,"I cannot recommend a better hotel. Fabulously clean and tidy, friendly and helpful staff and overall a wonderful atmosphere throughout the hotel. The Thermal suite in the spa is fantastic. I must complement the staff, could not find a fault, they were outstanding! ",5,2022,05,24
218,Helen Saved Us,Traveling from the United States and I didn’t have a room for my last night to fly out of Dublin after traveling cross country. Every hotel and B&B was booked on the entire map. Killashee was also completely booked all week. Helen took it upon herself to scour the system and call for cancellations and no shows and did not give up until a room was available. I have never before received this level of service from anyone. Helen saved me from sleeping in my car and Killashee has been the best hospitality I have every experienced.,5,2022,05,21
218,Thank you,"Gorgeous hotel filled with wonderful staff, particularly Helen and her manager, Ryan, who went above and beyond to assist me. Grateful for the good work and hospitality you showed during my stay. Thanks a million.",5,2022,05,21
218,Really enjoyable relaxation break,"I stayed here for 2 nights for a recharge break. I couldn’t fault the staff or the hotel. The food was delicious, the burger was one of the tastiest I’ve ever had. Breakfast selection was great and all tasted good. The hydra pool in the spa is a definite highlight, as are the beautiful grounds.",5,2022,05,21
218,Lovely stay,Beautiful place. Food cooked to perfection. Couldn’t fault the service. Staff were super. Would return just for the hydrotherapy pool alone - such a relaxing place. Gardens are an added bonus - beautifully kept! ,5,2022,05,21
218,Very enjoyable stay,"excellent hotel and staff, food very tasty and no complains, Room 324 has just been done up, only thing missing is a mini fridge, nice 2 seater sofa with a 65"" TV. The leisure complex was very overcrowded in the pool when we attended @ 1730hrs, only 2 lanes open, as the other were closed for swimming lessons, changing room very untidy and could do with the floor been mopped due to the heavy traffic of people.",5,2022,05,21
218,Keep driving!,"Everything was WRONG with this property! Upon check-into my room, I needed to use the toilet … The toilet and surrounding area had not been cleaned (there were pubic hairs on the floor). I returned down to reception to ask for a room cleaning and explicitly described the unwelcome hair collection. They said that they would send a maid. They maid neglected to remove the pubic hairs. The cleaning service also had forgotten to clean the room for about a century as there was so much dust and mildew that I needed to eat allergy medication … AND … there were moths in the closet. I asked for mothballs to protect my business suits, but the reception desk shrugged their shoulders and did not help. I would not recommend staying at this venue.",1,2022,05,19
218,Very enjoyable stay at this beautiful hotel,"Really well maintained hotel with professional and friendly staff
We were visiting family nearby.
The room and bathroom was very spacious , clean and comfortable 
Food really good 
Gardens were beautiful to walk around 

",5,2022,05,14
218,Fabulous!,"Amazing place to stay with family! Plenty to do with kids, great playground and swimming pool! Children had fabulous time. Food is delicious, staff is friendly and extremely helpful! I hope to return one day!",5,2022,05,10
218,"10/10 Beautiful Venue, phenomenal food, exceptional service","If you have been looking for a night or two away - this is the place. The staff are just wonderful, the rooms are amazing and the FOOD! I would go back solely for that food. The grounds and gardens are very beautiful. 20 minutes from Kildare Village. Great location, couldn't recommend enough. ",5,2022,05,10
218,A little old fashioned and worn!,"Stayed here last weekend for one night.  Hotel looks stunning from the outside.  Gorgeous Irish Castle with stunning gardens.  Inside however the check in area was very cramped and the check in desks were at an awkward angle and didn't really facilitate the long queue that had formed.  The communal areas were clean but a little dated.  The only bar open was upstairs in a very large function type room with lots of TV screens showing sport.  Not very cosy!
The room was nice enough and apparently had been recently refurbished, but I still thought it was dated.
We ate in the hotel terrace restaurant that evening and it was very nice.  The breakfast next morning wasn't great.  Quite poor quality.
The Spa/Leisure Centre is a good 10 minute walk away from the main hotel building.  I paid the extra 10 euro to use the thermal suite.  I wouldn't recommend this.  It was very old fashioned. Should definitely not be charging extra for this.   The only facilities were a heated pool and a steam room. No robes were provided.  Only one towel was given to you for using the facilities and showering afterwards.  There were no extra towels available anywhere. The changing rooms were grubbly.  I was the first guest to arrive that morning and there was a dirty plaster on the floor.  Not good!!
In summary nice enough hotel but 3-4 stars rating.",3,2022,05,09
218,"Untrained staff, middling food, terrible service.","This was the worst service I have ever experienced. I had a better time in the motorway McDonald’s on the way up. Not uncommon for an Irish hotel to claim four star status, but actually be a two star hotel with a four star capacity. But this one takes the biscuit. Don’t go here. ",1,2022,05,09
218,Excellent service but disappointing food,"I have been to the Kilashee three times in the last couple of weeks both with family and friends. The service is outstanding and they certainly cannot be faulted for the attentiveness of all staff from the bistro, bar to the terrace restaurant. However, the food is certainly disappointing in the hotel. I had the afternoon during one visit and it is extremely overpriced for what you get. The portions are a bit stingy and the sandwiches could be better varied for all to enjoy. I had dinner with a friend last night and the main dish was advertised as pasta but when it came out it was actually a risotto. It was extremely bland lacking flavour and vegetables (vegetarian dish). I sent it back and was not charged for it in fairness but overall, the quality of the food in the hotel is quite substandard and something that needs to be looked at I think. I would again like to stress how fantastic the staff are!!",3,2022,05,08
218,Disappointed local,"As a local and had many night in killashee bar , couldn’t get food even though nobody eating ,bar manager said booked out , would love to be able to put picture up to show how many people here !!! About 10 ,FBD are the new owners maybe they don’t care about local just residents,,",2,2022,05,07
218,Amazing hotel worth going to,Amazing hotel to stay at  great food was lovely thermal pool was good to do worth the 10 euro only part that lets hotel down are rooms  bit dated but hotel getting rooms upgraded and bars in hotel also will be all brought up to the standard the hotel deserves will  soon be back again when all done,5,2022,05,06
218,Night away,"Relaxing night away. Food was gorgeous, staff were very accommodating. Spa was very nice. It was very a very clean hotel. We had a lovely romantic night away. We would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2022,05,04
218,Timeless Elegant Luxurious,"The Killashee Hotel may have started out as a Convent in the 1900s but as a 4 Star Hotel & Spa now part of the FBD Group of Hotels, it has witnessed many couples over the years celebrate engagements, weddings and anniversaries and if you ever visited this hotel you will understand why, love is all around, from the luxurious suites in the original house to the snug bar, from a fountain in the centre of well groomed gardens and grounds surrounded by some of the most spectacular scenery overlooking the Wicklow Mountains to fine dining par excellence courtesy of the current Executive Chef, Phillip Gleeson with the food loving presented thanks to the warm and welcoming staff.
This is definitely one for the memory box and album.",5,2022,05,03
218,Four day break in Kildare,"Great hotel fantastic staff Lovely friendly atmosphere
Without doubt staff contribute so much to a lovely stay only downsize is bedroom carpet is dated and well worn, otherwise the perfect break.
Special thanks for providing free transport to races",4,2022,05,03
218,Disappointed,"Poor presentation your first impression is the broken tiles in the lift and the property continues on this curve as you see more. Bedroom shower has mould on the grout bedspread ws stained 
Leisure centre was in poor condition with tiles missing and generally poor location ",1,2022,05,02
218,Faulty Towers,"Disappointed with this hotel.  First off we arrived to book in at 3:00pm to be told our room wasn’t ready, no worries we thought we can wait, we were given tea.  The waiter who brought down the tea barked at us that he was told that the tea was for two women.  Right well not really my problem son.  4:00pm rolled around and we were still waiting as what felt like droves of people booked in and got through to the inner sanctum of the hotel.  We have a 10 month old who was wall fallen we scheduled our booking in time so he could have a snooze.  So I waited in the never ending line again and met the same lady on reception and I asked by any chance was our room ready.  Nope it wasn’t and no idea of what time it would be.  Great.  I hate having to tell people I myself work in a hotel and that this is easily fixed by re assigning a different room to us which might be a good idea as and minute now my baby is about to go nuclear oh yes and we have a dinner reservation in the bistro at 5:30 and would like to freshen up.  We got into the inner sanctum by some miracle (the hotel Gods smiled down on us).  Next hurdle was the lift to nowhere.  Excitedly we entered the lift to be whisked away to our newly assigned room hit the button and nothing happened grand we can call the lift again, we did but it never came so up the stairs we went with one baby protesting, two bags and a pram.  By this point I have lost about two stone from sweating  and my will to live.  Rooms are ok comfortable and clean however there is definitely a rationing on the auld heating as it cuts off at night, all jokes aside it was fairly  baltic at around 3:30am.  The food in the bistro was very nice and the waiting staff lovely.  Next hurdle is the pool let’s see how that goes oh and breakfast absolutely no  idea where to go for that as we were not told.  All we need now is Basil Fawlty to rock on and this trip will be complete.   220 for the night is on the pricey side for the disaster that this stay was.  I get it the hotel was busy with the racing but get your house in order.",2,2022,05,02
218,Perfect hotel for the races,"Stayed at this hotel to go to Punchestown festival, Great location only fifteen minutes from the race course.
The hotel has all the facilities you could wish for
The rooms are very comfortable and clean
The staff are very friendly and cannot do enough to help
Overall a great place",5,2022,04,30
218,great Location for Punchestown races,"As good as you want, someone  said just being sold about a month ago. Staff give real good Irish Welcome .really good spa and gym big pool .it was full for races when we were there staff coped well .
also nice long walk around gardens ",4,2022,04,30
218,Left Waiting for a Room Too Long,I arrived at the hotel 4pm and after completing the check in was told that I needed to wait for a room. I was given no explanation as to why the room was not ready on time and feel that the hotel management should do more for people kept waiting- an offer of tea or a free drink later in the bar would soften the blow of having to wait so long. This was the most expensive I paid to stay in Killashee and it was the most unsatisfactory. ,3,2022,04,29
218,5 STAR QUALITY,"We were totally satisfied with our stay. All staff went above and beyond to ensure we were totally satisfied. Room was very clean. Food was fantastic. Highly recommended. It's impossible to fault Killashee.
",5,2022,04,29
218,Disappointed,"Would have been happy to pay more, but considering how disappointed the room and pool facilities are the price was fine. 
Staff are lovely and very friendly although took over an hour to get us checked in.

218,Wedding,"Lovely stay for brothers wedding. Staff, food & cleanliness were excellent. Loved the snug bar. Service and attention during the wedding were top notch and food was divine. I had the beef. Our rm 226 was a bit of a trek going up one lift and down another but rm was lovely.",5,2022,04,24
218,Relaxing overnight stay,"Nice hotel. Lovely staff. Several events on in hotel  including a wedding and the service was still great. Staff also attentive and courteous. Room was well furnished and quiet. Bed v comfy. Nice gardens.

218,Wow!,"This was an amazing hotel. Beautiful setting, gardens, staff were so nice and service excellent. Good food and wine excellent  and the hotel was immaculately spotless! We will definitely be back!! Handy to locate and actually plenty to do locally. Sure you couldn’t beat it…. a bit of retail therapy as well!😉",5,2022,04,24
218,Mr John Mulpeter,"This was a great disappointment, with soooo called room upgrades on check in - If that was an upgrade I dare to think what a standard room looks like…Poor service, with failing to prearrange a taxi (Wasting 2 hours) on our trip to Dublin

Was challenged at breakfast - Are you a guest here !!! Very bad indeed. The hotel looks lovely outside, pity the rooms are not any better than a premier Inn - in fact a premier would have been better.

Hotel aspires to be something it isn’t and is overpriced for the accommodation.

EV parking only 2 spaces for 4 plug in points and cars left there for days, thus having to route cables under cars to charge - Very poor layout and no controls or management of EV charging spaces. With guests abusing these spaces, with no consideration!!!

Only good point was the location, as we were visiting family",2,2022,04,23
218,Warm Wine & Noisy Room,"We stayed recently as we were visiting family locally who recommended the hotel. 

We had dinner booked but there was confusion over which restaurant.  Food was bang average and definitely not a 4 star standard.  

We ordered a very expensive bottle of white wine that was warm upon tasting.  A replacement bottle was provided which was only a slight improvement. In hindsight, we should have not taken the replacement bottle either.  This ruined our night and we didn't bother going to the bar afterwards.

While there is improvement works going on, there is a lot of investment needed by the new owners. 

Plenty of staff who were clearly inexperienced but were very friendly.

Rooms were very warm and stuffy and very noisy. They need a big investment. 

Overall, it's way over priced for the experience and certainly not a 4 star standard at present but has potential.  However, unlikely we will return  which is disappointing.",2,2022,04,22
218,A short break,The Killasheeis spectacular in beautiful surroundings. We loved our stay staff were fantastic food in the Bistro was great service was fantastic. We loved our room too it was well laid out very clean & the bed was really comfortable. We would recommend the Killashee for a stay if your in Kildare. Breakfast the next morning was really good. Spa treatment was really good.  ,5,2022,04,21

218,Family break,We stayed in a spacious family room in Kilashee with our three children. Fabulous hotel with beautiful gardens and great leisure facilities. The staff were very accommodating. Another bonus is the proximity to Kildare village and the 10% discount! 🛍️,5,2022,04,15
218,Fabulous birthday treat for my mum,"I booked the Killashee House Hotel for my mum, sister and myself for a treat for my mums birthday.  The message I got from my mum on our return was ""thank you for the best ever birthday present"".  I think that says it all.",5,2022,04,10
218,Hot water tap in bathroom sink not working,Stayed Sat 9th to 10th in room 280 Sophie  Hot water in bathroom sink. Tap not working at all. TV also not working.  Despite bringing tap to attention at reception on Sat  Nothing rectified. See mould around sink also.On check out only a very weak apology. Very expensive price for room considering it is very tired looking. Food only very average in BIstro Restaurant also given price. Would not recommend and very disappointed overall.,2,2022,04,10

218,Class hotel,"We stayed in the hotel for one night. Absolutely excellent evening meal, breakfast and comfortable rooms - big and spacious. The pool was excellent too. All in all a great stay and the staff were so accommodating, helpful and the service was just excellent. Highly recommend for families.",5,2022,03,27
218,Afternoon tea,"Arrived in plenty of time and was shown to our table.  Had to wait some time for the high chair I had requested in booking.  Which I thought was bad as I specifically asked for one.  If I hadn’t then that would have been different.  

Beautiful, spacious bright restaurant with impressive chandeliers and soft colours.  
The afternoon tea menu of different teas or coffee, was accompanied by dainty  sandwiches, scones and delicious pastries.  
It was excellent value at €30 per person or €35 with a glass of Prosecco.
Bit of a delay while serving the afternoon tea and because of this I was offered a free glass of Prosecco on the house but unable to avail of this as I was driving.  

The main thing that I took away with me was if I were to go again (expecting too) I would not book for 2.30 as they kinda rush you out in order to get ready for their dinner service - held in the same beautiful restaurant.  I did feel this took away from my enjoyment of the overall experience.  Especially as they had delayed our afternoon tea in the first place.",4,2022,03,27
218,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff ,"I stayed at Killashee house for 5 nights and it was possibly one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. The building itself is old and gorgeous. The room I stayed in was large and comfortable, a comfortable temperature and a bed that gave me a perfect night sleep every night. The room was lovely and quiet too. The staff are super friendly and attentive. Suzanne in the Bistro really stood out to me. She made a point of talking to me as I was dining alone and gave some recommendations of things for me to see and do in the area. And then when she saw me again she made a point of stopping to say hello. All in all, a lovely place to stay. ",5,2022,03,26
218,Fabulous night away,"Stayed here in March. What a beautiful hotel. From check in to the spa to the dinner to breakfast ,the whole stay was enjoyable and relaxing. Staff were so friendly. The spa was so relaxing. Food was excellent. 5 stars",5,2022,03,23

Beautiful grounds, helpful & friendly staff, great selection of food for breakfast, also had dinner which was very tasty, overall very enjoyable. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2022,03,22
218,Not 4 star,"We paid just under €600 for two nights here. The common areas are nice but the rooms are really out dated and not nice. No one came to clean our room / restock toiletries/ change sheets on the second day. 

Food was nice but very pricey. Rooms are very noisy at night with other guests closing doors, using their sinks, etc. this should not be audible in other guests rooms!! 

I ordered a scone and a coffee and they didn’t have a knife to give me so I could cut my own scone - I was offered a fork!! Awful service 

All in we paid around €800 for everything. Avoid it - I certainly won’t be back.",2,2022,03,22
218,Overnight stay. Had dinner and breakfast here.,"Went with friends to celebrate a special occasion. We had dinner and stayed the night. The service was absolutely awful. The main points: several of dishes weren't served for dinner, our steaks were not cooked as requested, overdone and tough session steaks. Beakfast, again, several orders didn't come out at all (the staff told us the order wasn't out through, after 30 minute wait we asked them not to serve these dishes as we had to leave). We did tell serving staff and reception about our experience but weren't compensated at all. The bar staff were inefficient and even fruit served with drinks wasn't fresh. The whole experience was disappointing. This hotel does not deserve it'd four star status. Hope others can avoid a potentially disappointing experience like ours.",1,2022,03,20
218,Wonderful stay,"Highly recommend this place for class, style, service and food. Staff were amazing in every area from spa to restaurant and reception. We had amazing treatments in spa and hydra therapy pool. Can’t wait to return.",5,2022,03,20
218,Lovely,"We stayed for a wedding, everythibg was nice!
Things I loved:
Breakfast, friendly staff, excellent service. 
The place is a bit confusing at the beginning but we got the hang of it at the end.
Breakfast was above the expectations, and the service too!
The leisure center was something else, a paradise for the gym addicted!

Feedbacks on what they can improve so far:
TV's in the room 

There's no vending machine if you get startving or thirsty during the night.

218,Worst hotel stay to date.,"Can I start by saying I wouldn’t be one to complain BUT people need to know about this.

Stayed here last weekend for a little break away to reset. Walking out the door exhausted on Sunday was an understatement! 

We arrived Saturday the main car park was full so we found another one ( no signage) we then proceeded to walk into the hotel but found ourselves in the bistro with our suitcases! 

We checked in the receptionist was actually a lovely girl and very friendly. She directed us to our room ….. this is where the fun starts! We had to get TWO LIFTS to our room, on our way to the room (138) we were met with a bride and groom prepping themselves to enter into their wedding ceremony so we had to wait for that . We got to the room. We eventually got to our room after a good trek and some outdated wallpaper. The room , It was basic for the price we paid. Silicone around the shower tray was black and the thermostat was definitely broken as the water was lukewarm not hot . Hugely disappointing. 

We had dinner which was lovely the young staff were very pleasant. 

 That night we tried to sleep but there was noise in the attic / timber moving with the wind ALL NIGHT. I rang reception twice at about 12.45 and 1am as we couldn’t take anymore and I certainly didn’t fancy doing a marathon to get to the main desk in my pyjamas . NO ANSWER. the next morning we made a valid complaint and we’re told the general manager would call us . 
Which they didn’t. 

All we wanted was a relaxing night away :( 

Worst hotel stay, I would not recommend.",1,2022,03,15
218,Birthday celebration at the Kilashee Hotel  Naas.,"I stated at the Kilashee Hotel from 11/03 until 14/03 2022.
Beautiful hotel grounds in an area a short distance from Naas town, very excited when we drove along the hotel drive.
Check in was was excellent and the staff were very helpful.
Room was reasonable but the furniture was dated.
The shower in the bathroom was barely functional (had to chase the water) The extraction van in the bathroom was extremely noisy, needed replaced.

Breakfast was very good, great selection and service. We dined out most of the visit as the hotel prices were quite expensive as was the price of the drinks.

During our 3 day stay the room was never serviced. On day three I had to ask twice to get fresh towels, (the dirty towels were left lying in our bathroom) very disappointed that thus happened. (Health and safety issue )

The bar staff even refused small coins from me to pay for drinks,  they were however very happy to give you small coins in your change. 

The Kilashee Hotel is a 4 star establishment but my stay was disappointing for the issues I have mentioned above. The hotel is not cheap as it cost me 620 euro for my stay.
My wife and myself love the Nass area and will be visiting layer this year. I will however be looking for alternative accommodation than the Kilashee Hotel.

A great location to explore the country from - Wicklow and it’s stunning mountains just an easy drive from - I can’t recommend it enough, so much so that me and the Mrs-to-be are in talks to hold our wedding here, and if not then at least a part of the honeymoon!",5,2022,02,25
218,Birthday present,Coldest hotel I ever stayed in radiators on very low or not on at all it was like they were saving on heating bill very disappointed as this hotel was highly recommended to us and as it was a birthday present needless to say it was the worst present ever given and to be honest it’s not a cheap hotel to stay in,1,2022,02,23

I would go back however as the ambience is very pleasant and staff especially at reception were friendly and efficient.",4,2022,02,17
218,Business trip to Killashee,"Over all I had a very good experience. As I have in the past. Very atmospheric building. Room was very clean and tidy and more than adequate. I do prefer individual toiletries though rather than the big bottles attached to the wall. The lunch menu was very limited, and even more so for my vegetarian colleague and I couldn’t get a seat in the restaurant despite being a resident because it was valentines",4,2022,02,17
218,Fantastic Night Away - Would Highly Reccomend,"I stayed at Kilashee Hotel recently as it was Valentine’s Day. My partner has been put on a very specific diet and as a result of this I contacted the hotel in advance to ask if they could accommodate her diet. One of the members of staff in the bistro named Aidan did not just offer one or two dishes, he went out of his way to create a completely new menu. Aidan served us for the night and we both could not be happier with the absolutely fantastic service he provided. 

From the amazing rooms to the amazing facilities and gardens, Kilashee Hotel is a must stay destination and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice get away. I will definitely be returning 😀",5,2022,02,16
218,Avoid ,"AVOID . 

We stayed here last weekend and I felt I needed to write this review and warn others. 

Firstly,  at the entrance to the hotel there was rubbish and used face masks on the ground. We booked in and eventually found the room after needing two lifts . 

The bar area was not short of chaos. We sat down and immediately observed the number of young staff all messing and joking. The manager came over and said to them ""are ye having a meeting girls"" to which they didn't reply but examined each others nails and slugged bottles of coke. 

We then ordered a cocktail from the menu we were given. It was priced at €8.50 but we got charged €12. I asked the girl who called the manager who said "" ah jess that must be five years old that menu ""and dismissed my concern. We couldn't believe it. 

Rooms are standard , clean and comfortable but the service and running downstairs is a mess. 

Lifts are not that clean with a two inch difference in height on entering lift which I tripped over twice. 

Breakfast was nice , the room very clean but again young staff clueless and didn't seem interested. 

I had stayed here five years ago and really enjoyed but it has gone downhill since and  we definitely will not be returning. ",3,2022,02,15
218,Weekend away,Nice hotel with good staff. Not for those wanting a cosy hotel. Room was clean but lived in. Handy to both Dublin City and Kildare. Food was decent and the restaurant was a nice place to be. Not really our cup of tea.,3,2022,02,15
218,Can’t wait to return!,"Had an amazing stay here for valentines weekend, the staff were just outstanding.. so nice and extremely professional! The whole hotel is absolutely spotless and all covid protocols were adhered to by staff, not one mask under a nose!! Our room had everything we needed including a nice strong hot shower. The food in Bistro bar was delicious with a perfect portion, the tropical pavlova was the best I’ve ever had!! Excellent breakfast. Can’t fault one thing in our stay and can’t wait to return!! ",5,2022,02,15
218,Highly recommend,"We came for a one night stay and I couldn’t fault anything. Excellent staff, our room was fabulous, the leisure centre and gardens beautiful. The package for b+b with dinner was excellent value! We Will be back",5,2022,02,12
218,Short overnight stay,"Lovely overnight stay with my 3 sisters,  very relaxing. Leisure centre superb. Pool excellent. 
Hotel absolutely super. Friendly helpful staff. Great food. My only complaint is that the leisure centre didn't open until 9am.  ",5,2022,02,08
218,Lovely break away,"Killashee during my stay was extremely busy but that didn't in any way compromise the first class service we received from our arrival right through to our departure. All of the staff that we met from the reception to the waiting staff were efficient, courteous and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was just lovely. The only caveat to that was that our room wasn't ready when we arrived at  14.30. We went to the leisure center ( which was lovely) but had to find our gear in our bags in the main reception. I would have thought with even a minor inconvenience that maybe a small compensation could have been offered. Overall a great break though.",4,2022,02,08
218,Birthday break,"Overnight stay to celebrate a 70th birthday. Most enjoyable.Warm welcome, professional service. Lovely dinner in Bistro and birthday surprise at end of meal. Enjoyed walking around grounds the following morning. ",5,2022,02,07
218,Killashee Hotel,"Just had 2 night stay. Room acceptable and the Facilities very good. Main issue was cost. Didn't visit restaurant because of choice and price. 
The most outrageous was the price of a coke mixer in the bar. 3.70
So Bacardi + Coke
Vodka + Coke 
Total Cost €18.40
Sorry that alone with make me never visit this place again
I accept  prices have increased but this was a joke",3,2022,02,03
218,Amazing Hotel,"We just spent the most wonderful two days in Killashee Hotel, from check-in to check-out the service was superb.
All the staff are an absolute credit to this hotel, we wanted a nice chilled out stay to celebrate a birthday and we couldn't have picked a nicer location, the food in the bistro and the Terrace restaurant was top notch, afternoon tea was ordered on short notice and was simply divine and beautifully served ,the hydro pool was fantastic .
I can't remember a trip away that I have enjoyed more, really looking forward to booking again, will be bringing the whole family next time !Thank you to every single member of staff for making it so memorable. If you are reading this review please go to Killashee Hotel  its simply fab .",5,2022,02,02
218,Fantastic overnight stay!,"We had booked a night away for my fathers 70th Birthday and we definitely weren’t disappointed.

Upon entering, the reception area was well presented, with friendly reception staff, giving you all the information needed to make the most of the stay. 

We had booked two rooms; a junior suit and a superior double. Both were spacious, cosy and comfortable. The rooms had good amenities and were well decorated throughout. 

We were greeted promptly for breakfast service and given a choice of table. The menu was extensive and consisted of both continental options and full cooked breakfast (including freshly prepared options from the kitchen). The dining room was spacious and well decorated. 

Killashee is nestled in some amazing woodland, making it very picturesque. The building clearly has a wealth of history which is fabulously signposted around the building and grounds.

Unfortunately we did not have enough time to visit the leisure facilities… we will definitely be returning to test this out! 

Overall, we had a fantastic stay! All the staff were fantastic and couldn’t be more helpful. I’d have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my friends and family.",5,2022,01,31
218,Romantic Break,"We arrived at Killashee Hotel on Saturday to a busy reception which was a nice sight to see given the recent lockdowns. 

The hotel was warm and welcoming. The staff were friendly.

My partner had booked an Executive Suite and it was fantastic. The room was spacious and airy. 

The only feedback I would have for the hotel was that the room was a little chilly at times maybe a heating unit in the room would be an idea. Additionally, the mattress could do with being upgraded it was quite noisy when moving in the bed.

The food was very fresh and tasty. A nice buzzing atmosphere in the dining room. We also got breakfast in the room on Sunday which was a lovely treat.

Then on Sunday, we went to the Spa which was fabulous. I would definitely return to the Killashee Hotel. 

Thank you to all the staff.",4,2022,01,31
218,Exam Celebration Lunch,"I went to kilashee for lunch with my mum and godmother on the 17th of January to celebrate my exam results. My mum rang in advance to reserve a table and to order a bottle of champagne for the table. When we got there without being asked I was given a gorgeous dessert with ‘congratulations’ written on it which I felt was such a thoughtful thing to do. All three of us ordered fish and chips and it was absolutely gorgeous, I can’t remember the last time I have had something as delicious to eat out!! From the friendliness of staff, to the gorgeous food and to the overall atmosphere it was just the perfect afternoon. Can’t wait to go back, I have been raving about it since!!",5,2022,01,29
218,"Stuffy rooms , rude staff , 3 lifts to get to room","Worst hotel I have stayed in . Got no sleep as rooms were too hot . Bistro was unbearably hot . Hotel needs a major upgrade as it felt like I was a character in Alice in Wonderland trying to get to my room . Had to go through several corridors , take 3 lifts to get to room , Would expect much better for the coat ",1,2022,01,25
218,A very memorable and special stay in Kilashee,"We stayed here the night before our wedding and had an amazing night. The staff were absolutely exceptional and pulled out all the stops to make sure we had an incredible night. From all the help with bookings to food intolerances etc, they were very accommodating. We had a group booking for dinner and had booked out one of their rooms. They made a huge effort in tastefully decorating the room, adding beautiful foil age and flowers to the table (even though we didn't even ask). The food was also delicious and all our party were commenting on how good it was! We will most definitely be back!",5,2022,01,21
218,"Nice hotel, Disappointing restaurant",The hotel was nice but poor experience in the restaurant. Poor gluten free options which we were informed before arrival that they could alter dishes on the menu to cater for celiacs but on the night they could not do so. We were served pink chicken and when we called the manager we were informed in was “just a vein” which we were aware it was not a vein as half of the dish was pink chicken which was not eaten or taken back to the kitchen. Nice hotel just a bad experience with our dinner,2,2022,01,18
218,Fantastic hotel,"We were here over new year’s for a wedding n have to say it was the best wedding reception I’ve been to by far…n I’ve been to many in around area many times,…from the duty manager to floor staff it was very well done,,,,hotel is a real gem n congratulations to all staff involved 10/10",5,2022,01,12
218,Overpriced Food,"Have been coming to Kilashee as a local for food for years. We had not been since prior to covid, and were shocked at not only how little choice there was on the menu, but also the price. Whilst I do not mind paying for quality food, there was no denying that the burger and chips we received for 20 euro was simply overpriced. Equally, three small scoops of vanilla ice cream for a child, with no additions such as a waffle or sprinkles etc, was 5 euro. We won't be returning for average food at above average cost, covid or no covid inflation.",3,2022,01,12
218,Wow!,"Used to stay here annually so I was excited about getting to revisit again and pleased to say,it is still a superb Hotel.From the moment we arrived the staff were so friendly kind and accommodating. The staff here are so positive during the current climate for hospitality.
The hotel itself is beautiful.The grounds for little escape walks.
On this occasion we got to use the Spa and were overwhelmed by the standard of our visit.The Hydro pool is so clean and relaxing.Our therapists Abbie + Therese delivered our treatments to such a high standard that we will definitely return and request both of them.
A special mention to the 2 Jess at Reception who made us feel so welcome(even though we annoyingly arrived before checkin time)
Aural at Breakfast who made time for polite chat and all the restaurant staff..
Thank you all so much for a wonderful stay and wish you all happier times for 2022.",5,2022,01,11
218,Highly recommended,"We found very friendly, efficient and very helpfull staff, the well appointed rooms were very clean and comfortable, there are  beautiful grounds and great facilities with a very good recreation center",5,2022,01,11
218,Good Hotel,"Stayed for one night recently. Overall the hotel is nice and staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was comfortable and clean but could do with an update. Also noticed dirty carpets in the corridors leading to the bedrooms. We ate in the bar and the food was very nice, if a tad expensive for what it was. We didn't really enjoy the pool, it was busy and no one was observing social distancing in the sauna/steam room/jacuzzi. However, the thermal suite made up for this as it was very relaxing. A nice hotel but not sure if it's worth the price.",4,2022,01,10
218,Staff excellent,"Lovely relaxing break. Went on a girlie weekend to unwind. Good location. Nice Hotel, Spa was gorgeous, good price, staff very friendly and helpful. Would return to Killashee Hotel as very good price. Rooms need slight upgrade and menu good have had slighy more choice. But overall very good value for money. Would stay again. ",4,2022,01,08
218,Family get together,Hotel staff and service was excellent. The hotel as busy but not over crowded due to covid regs. Gerenaly staff seemed young but very helpful and welcoming. We will return agiin in the spring full credit to the managemant.,5,2022,01,04
218,A lovely place to stay,"Great location. Not too far from the town where there is plenty of lovely cafes, restaurants and shops.  Staff are really friendly and the rooms are very comfortable.
I would have liked a better selection of food but quality was very good.
We traveled as a family of four and really enjoyed our stay.

218,Killashee hotel,Very underwhelmed with this hotel. The spa was dissapointing the food average and not fresh. Overall this was a three star hotel with five star prices. We were not told on the day of arrival that the hotel would not be opened until three o clock and arrived to find the hotel locked. I would not stay here again  ,3,2021,12,30
218,"Kilashee, where customer service goes above and beyond ",I was in Kilashee recently and became ill in the hotel restroom.  Despite the fact that I was alone the hotel staff were nothing short of amazing.  I so grateful for their attention whilst still allowing me privacy.  Thank you so much to Charlie the Hotel Manager and the two female staff members who helped me.  Thank you so much xxx,5,2021,12,22
218,One night family visit,"We stayed here for one night last weekend and we found the hotel to be great . The staff were very friendly , and on arrival , we got little  Treasure maps and magnifying glasses for the smallies to go on the hotels nature trail . I felt that was a nice little gesture.  Food was really good,service was a little slow, but that can be overlooked at Christmas time. 
The only criticism I have is that we were travelling with a two young children and the lift was broken . We had to travel upstairs with buggies / travel cots , and bags, along with two young children. Looking back on other reviews , looks like the lift was out of order for quite some time too which for a 4* hotel , you would expect that to be fixed ASAP .  
Other than that the room was spacey and clean , and the hotel was really lovely . There was live music on that evening which was a real treat . All in all we really enjoyed the stay and would recommend to others .",4,2021,12,21
218,Killashee Hotel,"We recently stayed at this hotel for a nigh we found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. The 
Food in the restaurant was very good. The hotel is  very dated and cleanliness was poor, especially bedroom and walkways. ",3,2021,12,21
218,2 night break,Lovely hotel. Service very good. Staff friendly and efficient. Cleanliness very good. Covid restrictions adhered to correctly.bed comfortable. Room spacious. Loved having bath and shower in our bathroom. Hydrotherapy beautiful. ,5,2021,12,20
218,Family trip will not stay again,"Stayed overnight in a family room, two double beds. Room spacious but noise from hallway too loud kept awake until 3am due to residents coming back from drinking all night. Room service and restaurant menu very overpriced and poor quality. Reception staff very cold and upon check in they did not even ask how our stay was. Visited pool (which is a public pool so beware you have to leave the hotel) we were asked to leave the children’s pool for swimming lessons!!!! Shocking this is not a four star hotel as pool separate.",2,2021,12,19
218,Our stay in killashee,"We had a brilliant stay in killashee. There is no complaints the staff where so friendly and couldn't do enough for you, the food was beautiful and the rooms where very clean. We loved our stay and we both will be returning ",5,2021,12,18
218,Disappointing and not value for money,"We stayed for one night for a family wedding on 11th Dec. I have mobility issues which I had informed hotel In advance about. 
Check in was at 3 and at 3.30 my room was not ready. I was to be phoned when it was ready but this never happened. My partner had to go looking to see if it was ready at 4pm which it was. 
After checking in at 3pm and paying for the room I was asked if I had been informed the lift was out of order, which I wasn't. I was offered the use of porters lift which I was told I would have to go outside to use. It was raining all evening so I wasn't prepared to do this. And should have been informed well before check in day that the lift was out of order. There were two flights of stairs to the room, not one as I was told.
My partner had to ask 3 different people to bring our bags to the room, which were eventually left up late in the evening.
As I retired to the room and got into bed I saw the smoke alarm on the ceiling was sealed with a white plastic bag!
While using the bathroom at 4 am I observed 5 silver fish moving around the bathroom floor.
In the morning as I was getn ready to vacate the hotel, on the opposite side of the bed I slept in I noticed soiling on either end of the white duvet cover which made me feel sick as I had slept in that bed,and obviously was not put there by me!
I emailed the hotel in the reply section of their welcome email, re the lift out of order and the smoke alarm being covered, and gave received no acknowledgement or reply. I added a second email to it regard g the silver fish and soiled duvet cover, attaching photo evidence of smoke alarm and of soiled cover. Still no acknowledgement or reply.
I will not return and will be advising others not to waste their money booking.
The friendliness of their staff, the ambience and general facade and surroundings of this hotel is the only plus for it.

218,Overnight Stay 4th December,Service was poor. Food quality was average for dinner. Breakfast was very poor. Public facilities very not serviced. Shocked at how much the service has deteriorated since my many regular stays pre Covid ,3,2021,12,07
218,Excellent Stay," I did a one night stay B&B and shop with my friend and our daughters. The value for money was great.  Although the hotel was full, it never felt crowded. The standard of food for both Dinner and Breakfast as second to none. Staff were friendly and helpful. I am recommending you to all my friends for a lovely night away. Thank you for a lovely stay.

218,10 out of 10 stay☘🌲,"Stayed 4th Dec, hotel was beautifully decorated for  Christmas  🎄.  From the moment we checked in,  any of the staff we dealt with couldn't have been more helpful.  Great to have a chat with them during these difficult times. An amazing meal in the Terence restaurant.
We are so glad we have booked our wedding reception for next October",5,2021,12,06

218,Beautiful hotel but treatment by staff massively let it down - won’t be returning.,"I have held off leaving a public review as it’s not in my nature to complain. I have family members in the hotel industry & appreciate how hard it is particularly at the moment however having written a private review directly to the hotel and having had no response I feel compelled to leave a review. 
My partner and I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in June - this trip meant a lot to us. All was perfect until we went for dinner (included in our package) only to be turned away from the restaurant being told there was menu tasting on for potential wedding guests. To say we were made to feel not good enough to be there is an understatement - it was clear that potential
Wedding guests were more important than the guests already staying there. We were shooed away from the restaurant and told to relocate to the bar (but not to worry the menu would be the same.) To make matters worse we had called ahead to reschedule our time for dinner and at no time did anyone make us aware that we wouldn’t be able to actually dine in the restaurant we paid to experience - to have been given the opportunity would have been nice as we were staying for 2 nights we could have eaten there on the other night. 

As stated I left a private review at the time but no one replied.

As a suggestion perhaps don’t arrange wedding menu tasting at peak dinner time or make guests aware if it’s on - we paid a lot to be there and were made to feel like we weren’t good enough to dine in the restaurant.

Beautiful hotel (stunning) but this experience has definitely put us off returning.",2,2021,12,01
218,Lovely hotel in a good location,Overall it was very nice and found that the hotel had a great Gym but outside the hotel.  There is only one thing that didn't work for me.  The room looks a bit tired but the pillows and bed I found them uncomfortable.,3,2021,12,01
218,Stunning hotel with great people working there,"Loved the hotel- received an upgrade to a suite which was fantastic.
The Hotel is in a beautiful setting and is the best hotel, I personally have stayed in by some distance.
The staff are great and everything is well run and provides a great service to visitors.",5,2021,11,30
218,Ups & Downs,"Stayed here and availed of an evening meal and breakfast.
On arrival, we went to The Bistro to wait on our room to be ready - lovely setting but we waited 25 minutes after ordering from a waitress for 2 drinks, only to be served a pint in a dirty glass. We told a lovely bartender and he was apologetic.

We were staying on floor 2 - but to access this we had to get a lift to floor 3, walk across a catwalk and then get a lift down to 2. I had read previous reviews saying this hotel may not be suitable for persons with mobility issues and now I can understand why.
Our room was nice, spacious and clean. Good sized bathroom with seperate shower and bath. But the shower wasn't hot, himself went to tell reception while I got ready and he was told it was an airlock issue and to run the taps in the sink - this was a bit disappointing for a 4 star hotel.

We had dinner in the Terrace Restaurant - starters were delicious but slightly let down by the mains. Glenn looked after us and we thought he was just brilliant, he dealt with a very difficult table beside us with such professionalism.
We had breakfast in the Terrace the following morning and thought it very good.",3,2021,11,29
218,Alan,Very good hotel in an ideal location if you are going racing at Naas or Punchestown. Staff very friendly and attentive. Food in the Bistro was excellent and well above the standard you would expect in what essentially is an extension(albeit large) of the bar area. Highly recommend it,4,2021,11,23
218,Enjoyable,"We spent two nights in Killashee in Nov 2021. It’s a beautiful hotel, full of character. Rooms are clean but old fashioned. Dinner in the Terrace restaurant was 10/10. Spa is fantastic! We enjoyed live music in the bar on both nights and a trip to Kidare village one of the days. ",4,2021,11,23

218,Excellent,"This was the second time we have stayed at Killashee hotel. We enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and luxury of the room and hotel in general. It has an old charm and lots of history.

Would highly recommend there is a lot to see in Naas.",5,2021,11,22
218,Perfect Spot for a Relaxing Spa Break,"Went to Killashee for a birthday spa night away with my mum. Excellent value for money.

218,Combining a visit to family and seeing the  Hotel. ,"My wife and I are going to a wedding at this venue next year, and I wanted to check out the facilities as my wife is wheelchair bound. I spoke to a young lady in reservations about the rooms, and what my requirements would be.
I was given an upgrade to a junior suite  by Ciara from the reservations team and was impressed by her empathy with us. This young lady is a very valuable asset for the Hotel in customer care. My son lives in Naas and he and his family dined with me in the bistro, the food was terrific. The room was  fantastic and I had a great night's sleep. Breakfast next morning was really good. I was amazed by how well trained, a very young staff were. I worked in the service industry myself for most of my life. ",5,2021,11,17

218,Four star hotel on paper but not in person,"It all looks very dramatic when you pull up the drive but once you get past reception, its nothing special. The rooms are old and dated. Appliances need to be upgraded, bathrooms too. The spa was nice but not very relaxing. Dinner was good, breakfast was just your average hotel breakfast. Again, this may be 4 stars but I believe its a little expensive for what you get.",3,2021,11,12

218,Sunday night away,"Nice hotel, especially the older part. Rooms are big. Bathroom a little outdated. Leisure centre is big with 2 steam rooms and 2 saunas and a decent pool. Very big changing rooms. The leisure centre is a 2 min walk from the hotel and you have to leave the hotel. The grounds are nice. The food wasn’t great which was a disappointment. Poor selection and overpriced. Breakfast was ok. There was no cozy bar open where you could retire too after dinner. Maybe it’s a Covid thing but it’s needed.",3,2021,11,08

218,Excellent experience will definitely be back.,"I highly recommend the Killashee Hotel, we went on the overnight spa package and thought everything was of very high quality. Food was delicious, twin room massive, beds comfy, spa was excellent and staff were warm and professional. ",5,2021,10,31
218,Quiet retreat,"Excellent location to visit local attractions. Very friendly staff and helpful with suggestions of places to visit.
As part of the package we had afternoon tea and it was delicious and the restaurant staff were very helpful ",5,2021,10,30
218,Halloween Break,"Really enjoyed our recent stay. Our room was lovely, quiet and very comfortable bed making for a good nights rest. Both breakfast and dinner were extremely good. Staff very friendly and courteous. Only downside for me was how confusing it was to find our room but I will definitely be making a return visit.",5,2021,10,30
218,Really enjoyable stay,"We attended a wedding at the hotel. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The place was impeccably clean and the room was very tastefully decorated and extremely comfortable. The food was excellent and was some of the best I've had in a while, especially the duck spring rolls! Will definitely be back, thanks. ",5,2021,10,28
218,Lovely hotel and grounds.,"We had an excellent stay here. The family room was huge and very luxurious. The pool although in a separate building was very good. Although the hotel was fully booked, the pool and Jacuzzi were very quiet. Breakfast was also great.   My only fault was the choice on the menu's were quite limited for dinner and the hotel is so spread out it wouldn't suit those with mobility issues..",4,2021,10,27
218,spa break,"Myself and two friends had wonderful overnight in KIllashee.   From the moment I contacted Amanda in recervations to make the booking the service was first class. the Spa facilities were excellent, covid compliant and spotless, Lisa, Abbey and Leeanne looked after us very well. 
Louise gave us  a lovely warm welcome on arrival. Charlie organised a great table in Terraces restuarant where Gregg and his team looked after us and the food was excellent. the room was immaculate and very comfortable, Jordan carried our bags, very pleasant and friendly young man. we were only there one night but we felt so refreshed and relaxed on leaving. I would certainly recommend Killashee for a night away , or longer.
Well done to Dee, The General Manager, she has great staff and a lovely property, keep up the good work.

218,A memorable spa break,"A very pleasant hotel with a nice friendly atmosphere and a gorgeous hydrotherapy pool.

Rooms were large and we'll heated and spotlessly clean 

Waiting staff were a particular pleasure to deal with. Couldn't have been more helpful.",5,2021,10,25
218,Super hotel,"We stayed in Killashee Hotel recently.  It is a super hotel.  Friendly, professional staff and great rooms and food.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would have no hesitation recommending Killashee Hotel.",5,2021,10,22
218,Wonderful hotel with great staff,Recently stayed at Kilashee for a night and the whole experience was wonderful.  the hotel has old world shabby chic charm and full of history.  Our bedroom was huge and had lovely extra touches.  It was a birthday of one of the party and the hotel had a lovely welcome birthday card and made a fuss at desert.  The staff were wonderful from reception to the wonderful waiting staff who were all young and enthusiastic and an absolute delight.  The grounds are gorgeous and it is a night or weekend away where there is no need to leave the hotel.  Thoroughly enjoyable stay!,5,2021,10,22
218,Great stay in friendly surroundings,"Had a really enjoyable stay. Lovely hotel, friendly staff and good location, just outside Dublin. Dinner both nights was very good. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Was with a group and we were very well looked after. Will be back. ",5,2021,10,19
218,Friends night away,Overall disappointing. Hotel lacks atmosphere and needs updating.The rooms are very basic  with bathrooms that need renovation. The food at breakfast and dinner was average. Staff are lovely but seem new and inexperienced ,3,2021,10,18
218,Lovely for an overnight break,"I went to Kilashee Hotel for an overnight escape with a friend. The staff couldn’t have been nicer and the room and bed were comfortable. I was disappointed not to have a fridge and a robe in the room and the bathroom was dated however these weren’t the end of the world. Be warned that the Leisure Centre is some
Distance away from the main hotel building, but it is lovely when you get there. 
We both really enjoyed our meals and would recommend a visit to the Bistro. ",4,2021,10,15
218,Bar food - nooooo,"After a lovely afternoon today at the spa (would highly recommend) myself and my two friends went to the bar afterwards for a bite to eat.

Even though there were more staff than customers, the service was absolutely terrible. It took ages to even place our dinner order. The fish and chips (x2) and burger and chips took about 45 minutes to arrive. When the burger eventually arrived, it was over done, dry and far too salty but at that stage I would have eaten the table cloth I was so hungry. Halfway through dinner, we needed more water and couldn’t flag down a waitress, so I had to shout across the room to get someone’s attention, charming!! My friends’ fish and chips wasn’t bad, so that’s why there’s one star.

Give the bar food a miss.",1,2021,10,15
218,First Holy Communion visit to Naas,"We attended a family lunch at an excellent restaurant near the canal.

218,Fantastic getaway,"Stayed here as a mini moon after getting married at the weekend. Absolutely beautiful spot, service was excellent. Suite was absolutely fantastic. Food in the bistro was absolutely delicious. Highly recommended ",5,2021,10,13
218,Great Hotel,Loved staying here. Felt safe with the COVID protocols they have in place. Staff are exceptionally efficient & friendly. Food of very good quality. The grounds are lovely to explore & is an excellent base to explore Kildare. ,5,2021,10,12
218,Lovely stay,"Stayed for a wedding - arrived a night early, had dinner in restaurant - was really nice. 
Breakfast excellent both mornings (to room 1st morning and went down the 2nd morning. I highly recommend going down for breakfast, it's incredibly well run). 

The food at the wedding was AMAZING.  
Honestly, it was brilliant across the board. 

The bedroom was okay - I normally pay for an upgrade and I forgot on this occasion. My parents were in  a Suite and that was lovely so if I stay again, I'll definitely book one. 

I would stay the service in the restaurant the night before wedding was a tad slow - but I completely appreciate that hospitality is going through a difficult time at present with staffing levels / new staff / training so I'm sure it's just a teething problem.",4,2021,10,12
218,Fantastic Stay and Great Staff,"I received a very warm welcome on arrival and the staff I interacted with throughout my stay were extremely helpful and friendly, a real credit to the hotel.

Review of Kildare House Hotel
Pending review
Just returned from a fabulous stay at Killashee. Check in was very welcoming Jess was so friendly and helpful. We had a small issue with our room, and Louise and Jess were so helpful and accommodating, and went above and beyond to make sure all was perfect. really made our stay great. 
Thanks to Glenn in the terrace restaurant for looking after us whilst celebrating a 50th birthday
Service. Food were amazing. Felt very safe with the procedures in place.
Will definitely be back",5,2021,10,03
218,Excellent even when having to work under COVID restrictions,"I just spent four days at Killashee attending a conference that was held both in-person and virtually using the studio facilities at the hotel. I have stayed here previously (in non-COVID times) and experienced excellent service. I’m delighted to report that even given the challenges of COVID protocols the service was the best I could have hoped for. The team at Killashee made everything as smooth as possible … they even remembered my breakfast preference after only the first day.
I really look forward to returning when restrictions are fewer and life is a little more ‘normal’.
Oh and if you want a venue to host a virtual conference that knows just how to do it well … look no further.",5,2021,10,02
218,“meh” but overall okay,"I really was in two minds about this one. I waited to post a review because I don’t really know how I feel about my experience. 

I booked this hotel for my birthday. I mentioned it to the reservations team but I wasn’t expecting any complimentary items. Just for the stay to go smooth really. To my disappointment, it didn’t go that smooth. 

First I had issues with my reservation when booking. This was later resolved so I didn’t pay too much attention to it. 

When we arrived, again, confusion with the reservation, I had to explain the whole situation again ( you would think they would have left a note on the booking given there had already been an issue). 

Got to the room, the room was dated and could have done with a little bit of maintenance (nothing major), just the usual issues you would go and fix before changing the room status to ready. 

There was a bottle of Prosecco in the room, I was delighted thinking “that’s nice of them”. Except later on I found out this was sent by my colleague from work and the hotel failed to leave a note (as requested by them) or to let me know at all. I found this to be very awkward and unprofessional. 

We had dinner included on the night of my birthday so we dressed up and headed to the restaurant. When we spoke to the staff they told us that we did not have dinner included to which I replied to please ask reception as we already had this “argument” twice. They spoke with reception, same outcome. At this point I started getting very frustrated and showed them my correspondence with the hotel. A manager came over and apologised for all the miscommunication and said that yes we were right and she was going to comp our drinks for the inconvenience (I am honestly glad they did cause they were 99% ice and 1% diluted alcohol). 

At this point I was so annoyed and frustrated that it just completely ruined the dinner for me. I am not going to express myself in detail in regards to the food because I would have rather been anywhere else at that point. 

On the positive side the spa was nice and staff there was lovely. We had 0 issues and everything went super smoothly. The only thing is that there is no one to enforce COVID rules in the jacuzzi / sauna area which makes it hard to use when people are not being respectful. This was pointed out to the staff of the leisure centre who rudely just replied “ah well maybe we should just close it then, if no one uses it no one can complain”?!

The grounds of the hotel are stunning and the location is truly beautiful but the place needs a little bit of work. 

I am still gonna give this place 4/5 stars because I did enjoy my stay and I work in a hotel myself so I know that managing one post Covid is not easy, but I will say staff needs to do a bit of work. I would suggest improving communication across departments and customer service with a focus on how to log complaints and follow up on them.",4,2021,10,01
218,Disappointing service,"Killashee Hotel is a stunning picturesque 4 star venue HOWEVER, the service from some members of staff was appalling! In particular, at breakfast our table became quickly cluttered with empty plates and pots of tea/coffee, members of staff repeatedly walked past our table and did not once offer to clear some plates. I had to grab the attention of a staff member and request for the table to be cleared of empty plates myself. It seems that the younger staff in particular lack the use of their own initiative and for this reason I would advise they be over looked by a senior staff member at all times.  In addition to this, a member of the cleaning staff was seen in the corridor loitering on her phone. On another occasion, a member of our group asked for the direction of the toilets from the Bistro restraunt and was given a sharp response ""I don't know, it's my first day""! 

A 4 star hotel with a 2 star hospitality service.",2,2021,10,01
218,Pamper Time,"The Killashee was recommended to me by a customer so I was curious to check it out and I have to say that I was very happy that I did.  
The hotel was very impressive, food, staff,spa and beautiful gardens. 
We went to Kildare shopping village and The Irish National Stud which were both easily accessible from the hotel.
We loved our trip and will definitely go back to The Killashee.😊",5,2021,09,30
218,Excellent Hotel,I would strongly recommend this hotel.  It was so relaxing and the food and staff were amazing.  The grounds are second to none.  There was fantastic music in the bar following our meal which we thoroughly enjoyed.,5,2021,09,30
218,Disappointing stay,"A group of 7 of us recently had the spa package which included breakfast, a spa treatment and a 3 course dinner which was great value, however our experience was disappointing due to the inexperienced staff and a poor dining experience in the bistro. During our dinner staff kept forgetting our drinks and staff were seen to be standing in groups together. The soup we got for starters was bland and tasteless, main courses were fine nothing special and desert tasted burnt. We asked a member of staff where to bathroom was and the answer we got was I don’t know!!
Breakfast was nice but staff had to be asked to clear empty plates from the table. Staff liked a bit lost, a senior member of staff needs to oversee and direct service. No one offered us any food to order from the kitchen
I would expect a 4 star hotel to have air conditioning in the room.
The best part of our stay was our spa treatment which we really enjoyed especially the hydrotherapy pool.
Reception and spa staff were excellent.",2,2021,09,30
218,Friendly staff but room location awkward,We loved  the breakfast but the meal in Bistro not as good…also when booking try to ensure your bedroom is located nearer to the reception area…the superior larger rooms are located in an inconvenient area requiring travel up floors then along an indoor corridor bridge to go back down floors..,3,2021,09,30
218,Disappointing experience,"Spacious room undermined by carpet flooring obviously not cleaned or hoovered before our arrival. Also, cold breakfast selection very disappointing, pre-packaged cereals, fruit, and yoghurts, all available in a filling station. Very disappointing compared to efforts of other hotels in these challenging times. ",2,2021,09,29
218,Spectacular hotel experience,"We had the best time at killashee, family wedding was absolutely perfect from the rooms to the food to the pool and the staff everything was great.. my sister got married and the help she got from the staff was excellent .. best wedding I’ve been to",5,2021,09,29
218,Amazing Stay,Would highly recommend this hotel for every aspect of service and friendliness.  The food was amazing and the service was of the highest quality.  We would defenitley stay again given the opportunity.  The grounds were amazing and the overall experience was great.,5,2021,09,28
218,Excellent stay with minor hiccups,"Overall we had an excellent stay. Staff friendly and helpful, clean and lovely spacious room. Minor hiccups as keys stopped working several times, stopper in bath too small and drinks waiting staff slow ",4,2021,09,27
218,Lovely Stay,"Warm welcome from reception staff who were efficient and friendly.  Lovely spacious room  Could do with extra shower products as room was not serviced also extra water in room
Dinner in bar was disappointing Waiting staff were not efficient lacked training
Breakfast and dinner served in restaurant was excellent both in quality of food and service

218,Anniversary.,"Had a lovely one night stay, food was nice and staff very friendly, the room was very spacious, thought it was a little bit expensive for a night,  but we would stay there again as a treat. Had a nice walk around the grounds, loved the butterfly garden.",5,2021,09,21
218,Disappointing,"My partner and I stayed one night on way to kilarney and had quite high expectations but were disappointed.  We stayed in a few hotels on our break and this was by far the worst.  The hotel staff were all excellent and helpful, however the shower cubicles were damp and mouldy.  We complained about the first and were moved. The second room was slightly better and the mould wasn't as bad or going down plug hole when the shower was on but the stains remained in the cubicle. This may sound a little petty but we very rarely encountered it in hotels or bed and breakfasts we have stayed and definitely didn't expect it here. We also noticed carpets and furnishings to be a bit grubby.  All in all this could be quite a nice hotel with a bit of tlc.",2,2021,09,20
218,Short break in Ireland,Killashee is in a geat location to explore County Kildare. The staff were lovely - always welcoming and helpful. The grounds are beautiful. There is lots of space to relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings.,5,2021,09,20
218,Below Average,"The staff and food were absoltuley fabulous but the hotel and spa were a total let down. I don't like to leave a harsh review but we just felt we were rushed through the spa with inexperienced therapists. Not their fault. Both lovely girls but it felt like they'd very little experience which made the spa experience a waste of money and time. Other than that, both lovely lovely girls and the staff as a whole in the hotel were also wonderfully helping and friendly. If you like puzzles then you'll love the hotel as it's a maze to get around... Be aware if you like a few drinks as it might take you a while to find your room again ;D ",3,2021,09,19
218,Spectacular ,"I'm not sure where to even start! Such an amazing two days. We were meant to be in Vegas on honeymoon but covid had other plans so we visited southern Ireland. We received a free upgrade to a bridal suite and I can honestly say bridal suites are so wasted on brides and grooms! (We spent around 5 hrs in ours the night of our wedding). Everything was amazing, the staff were all lovely and so helpful, the room was clean and  blew all our expectations out of the water. The food in the restaurant was top notch. The hotel grounds are out of this world. The gym is unreal for a hotel gym. I'm not sure why this isn't a 5 star hotel. We can't wait to return.",5,2021,09,18
218,Beautiful hotel,"It was my daughter’s 21st birthday and the staff made her feel so special,they were wonderful, the food was great and the hotel is beautiful.overall 10/10.the grounds are fabulous in particular the butterfly garden",5,2021,09,12
218,Food good. Everything else,"Very disappointing. Staff trained to ignore customers. Took 20 minutes to place dinner order. Perhaps because I was a single female. Car charger took 10 hours. I may not have been using it properly but could not get any help from supplier or hotel. Smokers not welcome. No outdoor area and only two ashtrays that I could find

Food excellent when I got it. Hotel a maze. Even staff had problems directing me

Will not be back",3,2021,09,11
218,Excellent stay,We had a great experience when booking the hotel the receptionist was very accommodating and friendly. Katie who served us for dinner in the bistro was great! She made us feel very welcome and was extremely attentive. Over all we had a great stay but there were swimming lessons in the pool so we couldn’t avail of that unfortunately.,4,2021,09,10
218,An enjoyable stay,"We recently stayed at the hotel for three nights.  We had one of the original house suites.  They have a lot of Victorian character which we enjoyed, although I appreciate some people might feel they were in need of some attention.  For us, it was all part of the charm, and ideal to have a separate sitting-room so we could put the baby to sleep in there in a cot so he wouldn't be disturbed by us watching TV in the bedroom.   The suites in the original house are more closely located to the main hotel services such as reception/dining/bar etc., than the more modern rooms, which can be quite a distance away.  There are no lifts in the original house, but the suites are on three different levels and hence three flights of stairs, so if you don't like the idea of walking up a lot of stairs make sure you speak to the hotel and book a suite on the 1st floor.
Note that at this time the main Terrace restaurant is only open at weekends, and otherwise dinner is served in the Bistro which might disappoint some guests who were hoping for the more refined menu.  However, the bistro food is of good quality.
There is a children's playroom available which is full of toys and beanbags etc. 
The staff are all very friendly and helpful.
Guests have complimentary use of the swimming pool and gym in the spa which is only a short walk across the hotel car park.  nevertheless, the wearing of a swimming cap is compulsory and if you don't have your on you will have to purchase one at EUR3.",4,2021,09,09
218,Lovely Night Away - made by fantastic staff,"Myself and a friend stayed her last weekend.
It is safe to say that the service we recieved from the minute we walked in the door - is the best by a mile that we have recieved since COVID.

I understand a lot of places have had new staff come in but the staff in Kilashee were so friendly and accomadating - it really did make our stay.

We ate in the Bar on Friday night - the cocktaisl were phenemonal with a few twists to classic cocktails being featured on the menu. The service, once again was flawless. We were both vegetarian so had the pasta - it was tasty but perhaps a few more veggie options wouldnt go a miss. We were only there for one night so it didnt matter too much but just a personal suggestion. 

I was so impressed at breakfast. Breakfast is the hardest service to get right - especially in these times. The man on the door was fantastic - you could tell he knew exactly what was going on in the whole restaurant and he made a traditionally chaotic service run very smoothly. 

The only let down was the thermal suite. It was nice, but I do not think it deserved the extra payment (€10 pp) especially for guests.
We have been to a lot of hotels with better thermal suites that are free of charge for residents so that is the only slight criticism I would have on our stay.",4,2021,09,09
218,Review of Killashee Hotel,"The hotel is a wonderful building both architecturally and historically, enhanced greatly by its lovely gardens and charming garden features. The nuns’ graveyard add ambiance to the whole setting.  The staff, many of them young students, were helpful and pleasant and overall everyone was doing their best.  The room and its facilities were all fine, loved the many channels on the TV. 
Were the hotel fell down badly was at dinner on the Sunday evening.  The food was not at all up to professional standard and certainly not food which should be served up to paying customers, particularly at the prices charged.  My starter was the prawns; it resembled the left over’s from lunch, badly prepared lettuce, frozen peas, baby potatoes’, cold with skins still on and a few unfortunate prawns in some weird sauce. I asked for a dressing to try and taste the “dish”. It did not work. Awful.  Main course of fish, not much better.  My husband ordered the steak, the steak arrived, no vegetable, apart from half a mushroom.  The desert was fine, but I am sure that was bought in.  We made a decision immediate not to eat in the hotel the following evening. Found a very good meal instead at 33 South Main, Naas.  Very good food there.  

",3,2021,09,09
218,Nice hotel,Stayed two nights. Charged for upgrade despite two emails confirming complimentary upgrade if available.food was nice. Room was lovely although a little dark. Bed was extremely uncomfortable and was noisy when one of us moved. Rang reception and was told that afternoon that a new bed and mattress had been put in the room. Unfortunately the “new” bed had exactly the same problems as that last one! Very quiet despite a wedding in hotel and the room and bathroom were spotless. Food was nice in restaurant and bar. ,3,2021,09,07
218,Perfect,Very good hotel. Had a bed & breakfast & dinner deal which was all perfect arranged. We also booked the hydro pool at the spa which was also very nice. I would definitely recommend and come back another time.,5,2021,09,06
218,Perfect stay,"The hotel was absolutely stunning, we stayed for a family wedding, we explored the gardens & spent time In house which was so beautifully preserved. Nothing was too much trouble to the staff who were so lovely. Will definitely come back again to stay ",5,2021,09,06
218,nice relaxing hotel,We stayed for 1 night and we really enjoyed our night. The hotel is really nice and we got a free upgrade to a suit on arrival. Lunch was ok in the bar. Dinner was nice but needs more choice on the menu. service was very good and the bar area was nice and relaxed. Room was big and bathroom was also very big. everything you needed in the room. shame the pool and spa are across the carpark. we had booked but it was raining and windy so we cancelled rather than running across the carpark on our night away. might try it next time.,4,2021,08,30
218,Thank you !,"Great experience, we stayed for the wedding anniversary and were very satisfied, hotel atmosphere, friendly staff, great spa, delicious food.  
We had dinner at the bistro, we were amazed at how quickly the food was brought to us, the floor manager was very attentive to details and had absolute control of the restaurant.
Very happy to have chosen this hotel",5,2021,08,22
218,Would Recommend,"We had a lovely three night visit here in August. The family rooms are clean , tidy and very comfortable. We ate in the restaurant on the first night and the food was beautiful and very tasty. The breakfasts were excellent also. The staff are a credit to the hotel. Housekeeping, reception, restaurant, spa all excelled with their customer service. Couldn’t fault the hotel at all and would definitely recommend. A thumbs up from us.",5,2021,08,21
218,Amazing,"Cannot express in writing how good this hotel  is… Staff, food, accommodation, ambience, Spa, Gym, hair salon etc… so spacious. Booked this hotel for my husband’s birthday originally for two nights and we booked a third night, well done to everyone who makes this hotel so special… can’t wait to return and thanks to you all of you from the happy couple in the Belling Wing (17th to 19th August)🥰",5,2021,08,20
218,Nice Hotel shame the staff dont listen or communicate... NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY!,"I stayed twice at this hotel in the space of a month, 5th-7th July and 6th Aug. The first time was for our own tennth wedding anniversary. The hotel was notified over a week in advance that I was vegan and they said over the phone they catered for alternative dietary requirements. Because of lockdown and restaruants not being open we were tied to the hotel for meals. I pre ordered a vegan breakfast and asked as we were staying two nights could there be more than one vegan option for an evening meal so that I was not eating the same thing two nights in a row. I was assured this was all ok. 
On arrival and check in I explained all of the above again and was assured it was all taken care of. 

The room was beautiful we had absolutely no complaints there (clean and tidy as you would expect) and we were not sure but we thought we had been upgraded which was a nice touch. At this stage of our trip we were very happy. We went down for our evening meal and I had the beetroot wellington which was a little dry and needed a bit more sauce but tasty enough. However, unfortunately it went down hill from there mostly to do with the restaurant. 

The menu we felt was a tad expensive and the waiting staff were not clear when taking your order that vegetables were an extra accompaniment that you also had to order. It happened to us and we watched it happen to other diners where the main dish would arrive and there was nothing else on the plate excpet for the meat (or in my case the wellington) By the time you had called the server back and ordered the veg and waited for it to arrive, either the part of the meal you had was cold or you were eating your veg as a second course. It also made for a rather expensive meal and it was not close to being fine dining. I had to speak to the restaturant manager again about our meal for the following evening as for us it was a special ocassion. I was assured alternative vegan options would be available. 

The next morning we went down for breakfast and gave our room number. I could see on the paper for the front of house manager that it said vegan. We were shown to our seats by a waitress. At this point I mentioned I had pre ordered a vegan breakfast. She looked blankly at me and went to find out. She came back with a plate with three mushrooms, two tomatos and some baked beans. There was no non dairy butter for toast. The only thing they did have was non dairy milk. 

I expalined this was inacceptable especially with all the advance notice and asked her to fetch the manager. A female manager came and said that they do not offer any other vegan alternatives. I expalined this was not what I had been told when booking the hotel and ordering a vegan breakfast well in advance. I expalined they cannot have their cake and eat it. Claiming to cater for dietary needs and then not doing so or just doing it very poorly, no effort had been made they simply gave me the bits left from a standard breakfast. She said that they would aim to provide a better breakfast the following morning and said that the hotel would reconsider its vegan options for the future. 

That evening we came down for our anniversary meal and I admit they made an effort, they provided an alternative vegan three course meal and vegan chocolate on the desert with happy anniversary written on the plate. Although there was one slightly sarcastic comment from one waitress when she brought the wine we ordered with a loud exclamation here is your VEGAN wine before unceramonoulsy plonking it on the table. 

The next morning we went down for breakfast it was a different front of house manager a male one. I could see the note that a vegan breakfast was required.
To my pleasant suprise, he seemed clued up and immediately said after showing us to our table that there was a vegan breakfast for me. This time to accompany the mushroom, beans and tomato was vegan sausages and vegan black pudding and they had a non dairy butter so I was able to have toast with jam and butter. I thanked them and had a lovely breakfast. 

I went away hoping that the hotel might consider offering a brekfast to this standard for any future vegans and those allergic to dairy produce. Its not a lot to ask especially if its pre ordered in advance. I remembered what the manager said the day before and they would look to their vegan options for the future. 

ALAS... it was not to be. 

I returned to the hotel a month later for a wedding staying overnight. I pre ordered a vegan breakfast.. etc etc. 

The next morning was literally the exact same nightmare as before. It was the same front of house manager that served me the vegan breakfast the morning of our second night last time. He came out with all the things that one might say to try to make the situation better. Apologinsing profusely and asking if we were staying another night so they could put it right the following day. He offered  an avocado salad... but nothing in the way of a cooked breakfast.  I decided to get some toast and put beans on it and have a few mushrooms on the side.  Just as I was about to finish this he arrived back at our table saying there had just been a delivery of vegan sausages (which I think was probably code for we found the rest of the packet in the freezer from when you were last here) When they arrived at the table they had not been fried but had either been microwaved or steamed or something ... but they were insipid white and soggy and totally unappetising. Again the had made a half arsed attempt and not cared. I gave up at this point and we left. 

This hotel like to talk the talk but they dont walk the walk and clearly they love to placte people and make promises but they dont care one bit as long as they have your money. 

On a genral note, while staff were polite enough they showed inexperience and required more training, little things like not knowing what stock they carried behind the bar. I ordered peanuts and they didnt have any ... the apology was delivered with a comment about notfiying the peanut manager which did make me laugh to myself. She said that they could supply a packet of salt and vinegar crisps which I waited quite some time for. Then another waiter turned up and said they didnt have those crisprs would pringles be ok. 
We asked directions to the gardens from the bar. The waitress said 'what gardens'? She had no clue and had to ask another person. 
There was confusion over whether the bar was serving food or if the bistro part was closed. Then they were unsure what menu was being served in there. 
Some of the bar staff seemed a bit too relaxed, while I am all for people being happy in thier work the frivolatly levels were a bit too high. They were making me a cocktail and clearly they person wasn't sure what order things went in and there was a level of guessing and laughing. I could see everything that was taking place. (My sister happnens to be a cocktail waitress and it was one I was familiar with and lets just say I didnt order a second one) From a health and safety point of view bar staff were removing their masks behind the bar,  wearing them dangling from their ears and under their chins. 

This hotel could be a good hotel but it seems that team briefings either do not happen orare not communicated adequately. And certainly training is desperately needed. What could be a great hotel was severly let down by the above events. Any good things they did were negated by the bad. 

Perhaps they will be pleased to know we would not return and would not recommend. 

Three stars is generous.",3,2021,08,16
218,Fantastic staff & exceptional food,"We arrived last Saturday for a 5 night stay in Killashee Hotel for our wedding anniversary. I had stayed here last December with friends for the weekend & wanted to bring my husband as he had never stayed here before. We are seasoned travellers & are very lucky to have stayed in some fabulous hotels. Upon arrival there was a hiccup with the room, I spoke to Megan - she was lovely, very understanding & the issue was dealt with in a very professional manner. Our room in the main house was lovely overlooking the beautiful & very well maintained gardens. We chose to eat every night in the hotel for dinner as the food was excellent & definitely worthy of a 5 star rating. Breakfast was delicious with an excellent selection of fruit, cold & hot buffet. We had to prebook breakfast which worked out very well with last orders at 10.45am. The Conservatory sold take away tea, coffees, cake, scones & ice cream. There are plenty of lovely areas inside the hotel & outside in the gardens to relax & recharge. The hydro therapy pool was fabulous along with access to a full gym & pool with a choice of great facilities. Afternoon tea is a treat & very well done. This hotel has a four star rating but very much on a par with their neighbouring hotels - The K Club & Carton House. We will definitely return! Your staff are a credit to you, they are a great bunch!",5,2021,08,13
218,Excellent,"Just back from an amazing few nights in the Killashee. From the moment of check in to the moment of departure, the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. Property is kept extremely well and food was exceptional.  Very friendly towards children and leisure facilities are clean and Covid compliant. 

The bar staff, namely Qayyum, Kelly, Jonathan and Noelle made every effort during our stay to ensure we were look after and it is very apparent that they have all undergone training in respect of customer service and hospitality skills. 

Thanking all the staff of the Killashee for a great stay, your time, efforts and kindness does not go un noticed. Keep it up and see you again soon.",5,2021,08,06
218,Cleanliness and service,"Absolutely a disgrace worst hotel have stayed at, to on arrival dirty pillowcase and chair with false tan makeup all over it, our parents room had a stain on the sheets that looked like p.. on it. We booked dinner for 6 and I understand that there was 12 of us but think an HR is a bit much to be waiting on a starter. There seemed to me a lot of staff standing looking at us yet never offered tea or coffee etc, there was a seating area upstairs with a bar not opened but we had to go downstairs to the bar and bring drinks up no to table service bazaar in the current climate 

Picture of chair in the public area were it didn't seem to cleaned overnight

When we complained at reception they apologised but was offered nothing or didn't speak to a manager which I found quite poor, as we have stayed at the Morrison Hotel 6wks ago which was fantastic",1,2021,08,06
218,Fabulous visit,"My friend, her daughter and I visited in July and had a fabulous trip. We loved the room (although very warm and hard to cool down). The dinner in the restaurant was amazing, and staff very profesional. They marked the occasion for my friends daughter with a little plate of desserts and she was delighted. 
The grounds are amazing and lovely to walk around after dinner for an evenings stroll. 
The pool the next day was lovely and quite so we felt very safe.
This hotel really seems to have gone the extra mile regarding COVID safety measures, we felt safe in all areas of the building. 
Thank you for a lovely stay. I will visit again for sure!",4,2021,08,02
218,Amazing as always,We are  staying at the moment on a two night break and it is so good that I am reviewing Killashee  before my  departure . The room is beautiful and fully COVID Complient . Breakfast was so organised and a served full breakfast . The food was fresh and tasty and again all COVID procedures in place . Reception team and th3 entire team are friendly and so helpful . We have had two spa treatments which were amazing and the spa pool is beautiful .   I can’t wait to return and I recommend Killashee   Hotel to anyone looking for  a relaxing Staycation.  A wonderful Hotel with fantastic customer service,5,2021,08,01
218,Absolutely cracking ,"Stayed here for a night with my partner, from start to finish everything was perfect, the staff in both the bistro and restaurant all be it new to hospitality by the looks of them, they played a blinder, great service all round. The meal itself was perfect, great options and presented beautifully. Loved every part of my stay and I will be back!",5,2021,07,30
218,Stunning hotel,"Stunning hotel and grounds. We enjoyed the hydrotherapy pool and spa. Food was excellent, we ate in the bistro bar both nights and the steak was perfection. Staff were very friendly, plenty of them working but for some reason there was a real delay in getting our drinks orders both nights. One of our friends waited for almost 1  hour for his drink. Overall a lovely weekend and will certainly be back.",5,2021,07,25
218,"Beautiful food, lovely staff!","I went to the hotel and spa this week and really enjoyed it!
The spa - while it doesn't look like much from the outside, the spa inside is lovely, the staff were so nice and the massages I got were perfect!
The hotel - a lovely room, nice and big, huge bathroom - I got upgraded when I arrived so that was lovely.
The food - AMAZING. We got dinner in the bistro and the food was absolutely gorgeous. I would go there again just for the food.
The staff - I think the staff there are amazing. They strike the perfect balance between professional and friendly. The service at the dinner was excellent, and then when we had drinks afterwards, there was a girl at the bar who was so funny and nice. At breakfast, staff were so accommodating, and it was great to see a mix of ages, both younger and older, working there. I cannot fault the staff at all. Probably the nicest staff I've ever encountered in a hotel, and they all seemed genuinely happy to be there.",5,2021,07,24
218,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL AND GROUNDS,"As per usual I didn't take pictures but I will on my return visit. We booked the Spa Package with Afternoon Tea and front start to finish was fantastic. The pastries are to die for - blueberry eclair DELICIOUS. 

We had some time to spare before our spa treatments so walked around some of the grounds. They are immaculate and presented extremely well. We visited the Nuns Cemetery, playground, butterfly garden and even the Teddy Bears picnic house. You could spend a good while strolling around with plenty of food options.

The spa therapists are very professional and would highly recommend availing if some treatments.  We finished it all off with the Hydrotherapy pool. From start to finish, no complaints whatsoever. Definitely worth a visit, I guarantee we'll be going back.",5,2021,07,23
218,Fantastic gem of a hotel in Kildare. ,"Just back from our first ever stay at Killashee House Hotel and we will definitely be back. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we couldn't fault the hotel or the staff. The hotel is full of character, spacious and set in lovely grounds. ",5,2021,07,22
218,Get away from the hustle and bustle!,Gorgeous old building. Beautiful grounds. Fabulous spa. Hydotherapy pool is brilliant!! Staff are friendly and highly trained. Food is great. Wonderful selection for breakfast. The spa break packages are really good value. ,5,2021,07,21
218,Lovely family getaway,We recently spent two nights in Killashee hotel and I will definitely return in the future. Unfortunately as I am 7 months pregnant I was unwell during my stay and had to spend the majority of my trip in bed. I was disappointed that I didn’t get to explore the grounds more with my 8 year old daughter. We were on a family package for 2 nights B and B with one evening meal included. All staff were very helpful and friendly. We ate both nights in the hotel. On our first night we dined in the restaurant. The decor was was just stunning and the food was delicious. My daughter really loved the kids menu also. The second night we are in the bar and the food here was also amazing. The salted caramel cheesecake was probably the nicest dessert I’ve ever tasted. We managed to use the pool the evening we arrived and it was very well managed. There was so much room for social distancing and I never felt at any risk during my stay. This hotel is in a wonderful location- 5 mins to naas centre and 20 mins from m50. Our room had 2 queen sized beds which was perfect for the 3 of us. The bottled still water was much appreciated in the room. I couldn’t fault this hotel one bit and I just hope I’ll be able to explore the grounds more when I book to stay again.,5,2021,07,19
218,Will be back!,Really lovely hotel. Beautiful grounds. Food was great. Staff are very friendly and efficient. Stayed for a shopping trip to Kildare Village Outlet Centre. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again.,5,2021,07,19
218,Overnight stay,"Fabulous  staff very friendly, the gardens are amazing for  leisurely strolls, next time we will stay for 2 nights. Kildare shopping village is only 15 minutes away everything is reasonably priced. It’s great value for families and couples",5,2021,07,18
218,Great hotel,"From arrival to departure we had a great experience we have stayed in a few hotel in these last few weeks but this was the best hotel we had.
Also we got a  upgrade.
Value for money nice place to bring a young family lots to do for kids playground free games movie nite etc.",5,2021,07,18
218,"An experience guaranteed to delight both young and old""","Myself, my daughter needed a break from our own beauty business and Killashee delivered this in abundance............. Total pleasure with the Spa treatment been the cheery on the cake !! 
Food Excellent .... Staff Friendly ...Hotel Impressive ...Beds a Joy to sleep in ",5,2021,07,18
218,Frustrating stay,"While staff here tried their best they were all over the place. Untrained lacking 
Eperience. When we arrived our dinner reservations made 3 weeks previously were for the wrong resturant  i had confirmed booking days before. This was amended.  Then when I checked breakfast booking was OK it wasn't on the system having booked weeks previously. I Was being offered times much later in the morning that didnt suit us. I persisted. The girl on reception was helpful and rang me later on to say she had found a slot. When we arrived the following morning for breakfast they had no booking ! Seriously ??? Reservations and dining need an overhaul. Dinner in the bistro  food was good  staff couldn't answer one question asked about menu. Desserts took 40 mins to arrive . Difficult wait with small kids in our group. We wanted to order dinner using two srpetate bills, two room numbers That wasn't possible. We had to divide up the items separately from receipt ourselves. Thats ok just a bit strange. 
Again . Wait staff were lovely and tried their best but basics weren't there.
Rambling Hotel. Rooms very far away using two different lifts. Up to third floor to go down to first floor.  Dated bathroom and stained carpets in both rooms we had. Room had view of extractor fans of kitchen. Not the best but didn't rely matter.
Spa and leisure centre totally different buying at back of hotel. Amazing gym. 
Still had a nice stay for money we paid. €170 b&b  Garden terraces and drinks outside were fab Beautiful gardens and setting.  
More experienced staff would have made a much better stay.",3,2021,07,16
218,"Tired, in need of redecoration, disappointing not four star!",Unfortunately the hotel does not deserve 4 stars it needs new or clean carpets and to be painted badly in the interior. Very disappointing breakfast buffet style in which shouldn’t happen in Covid. The breakfast orange juice and apple were not fresh but diluted concentrate. I asked for a decaf Americano and was handed two sachets of instant granules. No freshen up service for your room as part of your stay so we ran out of the basics like toilet roll towels and the bins were over flowing. The pool wa too busy as there is no specific booking time and you can stay as long as you like but this meant the pool was very busy. The staff were very friendly and young lacking experience and it felt like this throughout the hotel.,2,2021,07,16
218,Beautiful hotel but lacks experienced staff,"This is a beautiful hotel set in acres of very well tended gardens. Greeted very warmly by the reception team and check in was smooth apart from a little confusion over the cost of the rooms. At the time of booking we were told that The Bistro restaurant was closed but this was not the case and we ate in it both evenings. The menu is quite restrictive for children however on the second night we learnt through looking at other plates that you could order off the room service menu which suited us better with burgers and goujons etc. Although when we enquired about this it took asking  three separate waitresses if this was the case. There  is an abundance of staff in the restaurant, at one point we counted 15 mulling around and yet the service is very poor. This is by no means a reflection on the staff as they are all so pleasant but clearly have no experience in hospitality with little supervision , we didn’t see anyone that looked over 20, they seem to just wander around all the tables without any clear direction which means slow service and a lack of communication between everyone. Again no reflection on the staff but perhaps a clearer direction on what tables to be served would allow for a more attentive and quicker service.  Breakfast is great with a wonderful choice  of hot and continental. 
All in all a wonderful hotel and we would hope to return.",4,2021,07,15
218,Split Personalities of this hotel lets it down,"Stayed here for one night as a couple as part of a shopping trip to Kildare village/Dublin. This hotel is really a strange one, as it trades on it's heritage which to be fair is stunning, the main house is beautiful from what we saw of it from the outside, sadly it was closed off for a wedding on the inside so we only had glimpses. 

The main hotel is a bit more disappointing the further you go from the old house and has obviously been over extended to cater for large numbers. the two lifts and never ending corridors in the drab multi extensions is not what I had hoped from this hotel stay.  

The dining room is lovely and well spaced for Covid, the food and wine very good as was breakfast.

However, the bar areas and lounge areas were not appealing, with so many people and children everywhere. I feel like this hotel caters to pack 'em in rather than a personable, customer centric hotel stay. Enchanting it was not.",3,2021,07,15
218,Relaxed Atmosphere,Beautiful gardens.  Relaxed hotel with friendly staff.  Clean rooms.  We had a brilliant huge bedroom to suit 2 adults and 3 children.  Drinks service was a little slow.  A little disappointed with the selection for the menu in the Terrace restaurant.  Breakfast was yummy.  An up to date movie was put on for kids movie night.,4,2021,07,15
218,“Family friendly” needs work but would be fantastic for couples,"Absolutely lovely stay and the staff were all brilliant in the hotel from the reception to the Porter to the restaurant. The food each meal time was fabulous. Menu was limited at dinner but every single item ordered was just beautiful.  

The leisure centre severely let down the team. Not only was the woman on the desk on Monday abrupt and miserable, she was misleading. We phoned over beforehand asking if there was a family changing room and was told yes. We packed our swim bag as a family but then was told there was no access for us all as we have to go through either the men’s or the women’s. This is very awkward for a “family friendly hotel”. As said, the lady on the desk at the leisure centre did not want to be there. She was so unwelcoming and her demeanour was miserable. 

Another awkward part of the stay was the two lifts and long walk to get to our room. With two little ones, we found we had to pack up to leave our room and couldn’t just pop back if we forgot something. 

The hotel itself is so well kept and maintained. Just walking through it is a lovely experience. The gardens are stunning but again, not family friendly for pushing a pram on the stones and the park is for older children. My 4 year old couldn’t access the climbing frames and slides which was frustrating for her. 

I think if my husband and I stayed on our own, it would’ve been perfect and I would’ve rated it 5/5 but we didn’t. We picked this hotel as it appealed to families but it let us down as a family in more ways than one.",3,2021,07,15
218,Friends catchup,Great welcome on arrival. Our room was very spacious and spotless. More choice on the food menu would be great. Fabulous gardens to explore and lots of places to sit and chat or just chill. Lovely relaxing time. ,5,2021,07,14
218,Great staycation ,"Fabulous hotel. Cannot praise this hotel enough. 
Staff.. very attentive 
Food.. exceptional 
Spa... best head, neck, and back massage ever... Thankyou Emma C
Hydro pool amazing
First staycation since covid , was a bit nervous at first, but hotel and staff very safety conscious. 
Will definitely be back.  
Thankyou so much",5,2021,07,13
218,Not great,Stayed here last week with my family would not recommend decor dated and not enjoyable atmosphere even given the current restrictions are oils not highly recommended to families maybe couples would be more suited,2,2021,07,12
218,One night visit to Nass&Kildare,"We had the pleasure to stay in this beautiful hotel and had a wonderful one night stay.We visited the leisure centre when we arrived and thought it was excellent.We had booked the package which included the evening meal,the food was amazing and my wife was able to pick vegetarian options without issue off another menu that wasn’t the dinner menu.
The restaurant is stunning and tables were far enough apart for social distancing,we stayed in a family room which was spotless and very spacious and all had a great nights sleep.We returned to the restaurant for breakfast which had plenty of variety of hot &cold choices.At all times the staff were constantly checking that you had every thing you needed without being over intrusive.I honestly can’t praise the staff enough in these difficult times and look forward to returning too the hotel soon.If your looking somewhere close to Kildare village shopping or Nass I would really recommend this hotel.",5,2021,07,12
218,Killashee Hotel - a wonderful experience.,"The minute we entered the long driveway to the hotel, we could see this hotel was a special location. Nicely designed an maintained gardens & box hedging gave a very positive first impression. Hotel itself was beautiful. Staff, facilities, & food were first class.",5,2021,07,12
218,Wonderful 3 nights away,"Just back from a wonderful three days here celebrating my partners birthday. I couldn't fault the hotel or the staff, everything was lovely and all the staff were pleasant and helpful.
Check-in was quick and easy, and there was a porter on hand to help with our bags. On arrival to the room there was a note from the general manager wishing my partner a happy birthday and a box of chocolates. 
Breakfast on all mornings was lovely, tea/coffee was delivered to the table and everything else was buffet style.
We had afternoon tea on our 2nd day and the desserts were beautiful. We also had dinner in the restaurant, the menu wasn't to my liking but I will admit I'm a fussy eater! I had requested a birthday plate with dessert and the staff delivered it while singing happy birthday, much to the embarrassment of my partner!
We had room service for lunch one afternoon, food was tasty, hot and well presented. 
We used the leisure centre every day and the pool was nice and clean.
We also used the hydrotherapy suite, I would highly recommend-it was amazing! We then went for massages and the therapists were wonderful. We finished with the relaxation suite, overall our spa experience was amazing!",5,2021,07,11
218,"Excellent service, food and overall experience","It was my first time staying in a hotel since Covid hit and I wasn't sure what to expect.  The staff were amazing from arrival to departure.  The hotel clearly invested a lot of consideration in their safety measures from check-in, protocol, cleanliness and dining.  
The property is so big it has a variety of dining options.  It can accommodate families in an area upstairs for relaxed dining with its own bar where the children can have some freedom, a bistro for drinks and dinner or the beautifully period 
Terrace restaurant for formal dining.  
We were a party of 4 friends who got a great package that included afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast all in the Terrace.  We were given the option to dine in the bistro as that is where we were having pre-dinner drinks but chose to go back to the Terrace as it really is a beautiful room.
All meals were excellent and the service was top class, very attentive.  Meals and plates were piping hot.  There is also a great cocktail list which we all sampled.
The set up for breakfast was very well executed with continental and hot buffet options with staff appointed to dish up the buffet and toast bread on our behalf.  
Check-in and out was swift and organised to ensure minimum contact.  
The weather was bad but the gardens are beautifully maintained.
Our rooms were large, spotless and there were nice touches like complimentary chocolates and water.  Disposable cups and glasses also replaced the standard ware for hygiene purposes.
I didn't avail of the spa this time but I have been previously without staying over.  The spa is as well appointed as the hotel with lots of options and great therapists.
I would highly recommend a stay at Killashee.  Thank you.",5,2021,07,09
218,"Fantastic Food, Fantastic Stay.","Myself and my friend stayed here for one night last weekend. The hotel itself is beautiful and steeped in history. It has impressive decor inside and really keeps in with the classic look, of the outside building. Our room was spacious with a lovely view of the gardens. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were a dream! They staff were all so accommodating, genuine and friendly. A credit to the hotel. The grounds were beautiful, and we loved strolling around them, taking in the views and birds singing. The highlight of our stay was the food! We ate in the bistro, and every course was amazing ! We are both vegetarians and the effort that was put in to accommodating us was second to none! Thank you to the staff for the lovely birthday dessert and singing !! We loved every minute of our stay and will definitely be back, and treat ourselves to a suite ! I would recommend Killashee to everyone! Well done to everyone at the Killashee for all their hard work !",5,2021,07,05
218,Nice hotel with beautiful grounds in proximity to Naad,"We stayed for three nights at the hotel and had a pleasant stay. The hotel has clearly employed a lot of young people in the locality and while most of them were very good and attentive, there is undoubtedly some teething problems but nothing that would bother me too much. We booked an executive room which was nice if a little dated. We had one evening meal in the terrace which I felt was overpriced for what it was, although it was all still very tasty especially the desserts! I was disappointed that our room could not be serviced during our stay (this was stated for COVID-19 reasons), we were made aware that we could request fresh towels but it would have been nice if this was done in any case as I'm not sure that this has much covid risk seeing as rooms are clearly occupied every night. If you are staying in the hotel and wish to use the pool it is also worth being mindful that there are limited hours when hotel residents can use the leisure facilities. Overall I would stay at the hotel again but would be uninclined to return to the restaurant.",4,2021,07,03
218,Fabulous stay at the Kilashee Hotel.,"We stayed at the Kilashee Hotel and could not recommend it enough, from the moment we walked through the doors, the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly.  The hotel is set on beautiful grounds with lovely terrace areas.  Conveniently located to Naas Town with beautiful bars and restaurants.  We most certainly will be back.!",5,2021,07,02
218,Great Hotel needs a small amount of attention,Really enjoyed our stay here but little things are making it a little bit tired ant could really make a difference. So the overall experience was good but the attention to detail such as replacing bulbs in the very expensive chandeliers and repairing or replacing worn carpet would make a difference. The staff are well trained and professional and our stay was enjoyable but far too often I've seen good hotels become average and let standards slip - it's a fantastic building with great potential but the hotel need to improve if it wants to maintain the 4 star rating.,3,2021,07,01
218,"Beautiful place, food needs to step up to match surroundings.",Beautiful  building and gardens.  Lots of young people working who were polite and well trained. Food was average and needs improving. Rooms spotless and comfortable beds. great location for visiting newbridge silver and kildare village.  ,4,2021,06,30
218,Fabulous weekend,"Great weekend. The rooms were beautiful, very clean and comfortable. The food in both the restaurant & bistro was beautiful. Excellent quality and choice. Breakfast was also really nice, with a great selection and very well organised. Shout out to Zara in the bistro, Jack who helped us to our room & Breda in reception. All were the most helpful and friendly people you could meet. Great representatives for a great hotel. ",5,2021,06,29
218,Friendly and attentive staff,Had a very enjoyable stay recently when visiting the Curragh. Enjoyed dinner in the Bistro and breakfast in the Terrace. The gardens are well with a walk through. Great character in the hotel. Would stay again. ,5,2021,06,29
218,Trip was with friends few days break,Few lady friends (seniors) decided we needed a break after been locked down due 2 virus and did not want 2 travel 2 far from home so the Killashee hotel was just one hour drive from our homes and it was just perfect fir us in every way will definitely return,5,2021,06,27
218,Great Experience,"Beautiful Hotel, with supurb gardens amazing food and friendly staff. The whole experience leaves you feeling valued and I am looking forward to my next visit already ..very central to Dublin and plenty of good bars and restaurants in the town if required.  ",4,2021,06,27
218,Perfect,Wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel. dinner was incredibly delicious followed by a sublime desert and the most yummy cocktails. The staff couldn’t be nicer. The grounds are gorgeous too. It was perfect. ,5,2021,06,26
218,Fabulous stay,The hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. The food in the restaurant and room service was delicious. The grounds and gardens were pleasant. Overall all we had a fabulous stay.,5,2021,06,25
218,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed last night for 1 night. Everything was perfect, staff were friendly and welcoming. We had dinner which was delicious and breakfast delicious too. Waiters and waitresses were very attentive and helpful. My husband used the pool and said it was lovely. We will hopefully return soon.",5,2021,06,24
218,Lovely weekend break,"Stayed for 2 nights with my wife. Room was spacious and clean with a nice view over the gardens. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent as were our 2 dinners in the Bistro.
As the hotel had just reopened there were lots of new young staff who were a little green. They were all polite and hard- working though. It was clear that great efforts are being made to train them in well. We will be back. ",5,2021,06,21
218,Birthday Surprise,I brought my wife to gorgeous Killashee as a surprise for her birthday.  The grounds of the hotel are lovely for a stroll and we had a gin and tonic on the terrace.  We had to wait about half an hour for our room to be ready but it was worth it.  The hydrotherapy suite before our massages was a relaxing way to spend an hour.  All the staff were polite and friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  We both agree that we will be back.,5,2021,06,21
218,We would stay again but not anytime soon,"Stayed here for a birthday weekend a couple of weeks ago for a much needed break. All the staff were very friendly and social distancing was adhered to. 

However there were some issues that brought the rating down for us. We were asked if we wanted to pay for everything at check-in including our spa treatment which we did. However after the lovely treatment we were told at the spa that we hadn’t paid and that we couldn’t have paid at the main reception desk. Another staff member stepped in and asked the girl to ring the main reception to check. Needless to say we found this very embarrassing which soured the treatment. There needed to be better communication between both reception areas to avoid anything like that happening.

Our biggest issue was that we had to return our key card for our room 3 times as they stopped working after the first (sometimes second) use. This was incredibly frustrating and the staff were not very surprised by this each time. We did complain about this at check-out.

The food was disappointing. Our dinner in the Terrace restaurant was cold and we had to return our starter the second night as it was stone cold. Despite the tables spaced out to ensure social distancing, we were surprised that breakfast was not table service which meant we had to queue up to retrieve breakfast from staff. On both occasions other guests were standing on top of us and reaching across to get their food. There was plenty of staff on hand so it would have felt much safer to have had table service. There also seemed to be a lot of guests staying despite the reduced capacity which we were a little uneasy about.

We would definitely stay again as the hotel is lovely and staff were friendly but unfortunately, not any time soon.",3,2021,06,18
218,Not a 4 star experience,"Pro’s:

-  The grounds are beautiful with lovely gardens and playground for children.

- The men working In the main bar were friendly and made us cocktails that weren’t on the menu.

Cons:
- Lady at check in wasn’t that nice or inviting.
- The wine was not cold had to ask for ice. This happened at dinner and also in the bar. 
- No one poured our wine at the dinner or asked if we wanted to try it.
-  The dinner menu was not as advertised on website. Very poor choice.
- The room service menu had more choice than the dinner menu which didn’t make sense. 
- The fish main was very salty.
-  The breakfast was a buffet which isn’t a four star service. I don’t understand why there was no table service. The breakfast was average like you’d get at a deli.
- Bedroom was dated and no fridge.
- We had to ring twice for robes to be brought up to our room.",3,2021,06,17
218,Ignore the Moaners reviews !,"In the middle of a 3 night stay here and all I can say that it's great to back for the people who work tirelessly to make this hotel a great experience for their guests. I've overheard a few moaners while I've been here who I would suggest are high maintenance and expect to be treated like the Kardashians while they are here . Staff have bent over backwards to these idiots .. offering replacement Meals.. discounting their food tabs and the customers still have faces on them . I cannot fault the rooms , the food (outstanding ) or indeed the remarkable experience we have had here so far . .. and feel the staff are wasting their time with some of these complaints and the hotel should reward the happy guests and let the moaners leave unhappy in the hope they'll never return . Thanks to all at Killashee! ",4,2021,06,16
218,Fantastic ,This is a Fantastic hotel. We stayed in a suite in the old part. So beautiful.  Very big room and sitting room. Room great with lovely view. Food excellent as are the staff. Very courteous.  Not too far from Dublin. Lovely spot.  Well worth a visit. ,5,2021,06,15
218,Nice visit..,"Amazing building and grounds at this hotel. Check in was very slow with a half an hour queue. When we got to the desk we were told our room was not ready (this was 3.30pm). We were not allowed to leave our luggage and were told we would have to bring our luggage to the bar and wait or else bring our luggage back out to the car. The room was not available until 4.30pm which was a bit ridiculous. The corridor we were on had a funny smell however the room was lovely, clean and big with 2 double beds. The room was very warm with no option to adjust heat so we slept with window open. Both dinner and breakfast were nice with desserts being the highlight. We sat outside on the terrace after dinner for drinks..we were told at 10.20pm that we would have to go inside if we wanted more drinks. On such a lovely evening we wanted to stay outside so we thought this was a bit strange. Staff were so friendly throughout our stay. Overall this was a good visit.",4,2021,06,14
218,Very Disappointing First Visit,"We were really looking forward to this break and as a treat, we booked one of the original suites however, I did not notice either on the website nor when booking, any warning that there was no lift access to the suites.

Check-in obviously due to Covid-19 restrictions, took a bit longer than usual. The Receptionist was polite but she didn't check if we'd made reservations for dinner or breakfast and only did so when I'd asked her to confirm our times nor did she indicate where breakfast would be served etc.  She then directed us to our room and said, ""go through that corridor and up the stairs"" and as she didn't offer us any help with our luggage, we wrongly thought that it was only a few steps.

We had a bit of luggage with us as we'd stopped off en-route in Kildare Village.  We both were really surprised that ""up the stairs"" was up over 50 steps over 2.5 floors.  Due to my still being in recovery from a knee and back injury and my husband having a hip replacement, it was a torturous trip. I did go back to Reception to ask for help with our luggage but the queue for check-in was so long, that I didn't wait.

Our ""suite"" was very tired and the bed was only a double which was a shock as it was also very hard and very uncomfortable.  Trying to take into consideration that the hotel had been closed for so long, our experience was still disappointing. One of the curtains in the sitting room was hanging down, we were unable to use the safe as the ""battery cover"" was missing and therefore the battery pack was hanging out of the safe.  There was also dust and fibres under the radiator cover in the sitting room and dust fluff on the lead of the lamp. The bathroom door only closed with a bit of effort as the top of the door was too proud for the frame. And surprisingly, there was lukewarm water coming out of the cold tap!

Dinner on both nights was just ok with the food in the Bistro being slightly better than the Restaurant. As for breakfast, while the hot food was lukewarm the first morning, as it was busier the second morning, we hoped it would be better. Sadly, it wasn't. The scrambled eggs were stone cold and the mushrooms were also cold with black liquid oozing out of them. When I mentioned it to a Manager, she did get the chef to remove the eggs however, breakfast was ruined for me.

We had spoken with a receptionist the night before departure and she had confirmed that there is no mention on the website about there being no lift access to the suites however, she did say that we could get help with our luggage when we were leaving, which we did request.

Check-out was done without being asked if our stay was ok, which it wasn't. I'm aware that the Receptionist seemed new but guest satisfaction should be important. Just before I left, I did say to her that I was disappointed that she hadn't asked me how our stay was as we hadn't enjoyed it and she didn't really respond.

For the cost of our stay, due to our experience, it really wasn't value for money at all and with the food we experienced, it was more than disappointing. Not being advised that there was no lift access to the Suites was the biggest issue for us as if we'd known that, we would not have stayed. We have stayed in other hotels that would be as old if not older than Killashee and they have had lift access so it was a shock.

The only positive for us really was that the waiting staff were very friendly and welcoming.

Given the anticipation for our break away, our experience was such a disappointment.",2,2021,06,12
218,Wonderful Stay at the Killashee Hotel,"Great to be back and able to stay at the wonderful Killashee Hotel. The bookings of restaurant for dinner and breakfast, and pool, etc seamless and straight forward. The Hotel and grounds are wonderful, nice little areas for a walk. Meals excellent, well prepared and nice variety. 
The room was excellent, the staff so friendly and very efficient with all Covid measures in place. 
The Pool area very nice and great to have the sauna available too.",5,2021,06,09
218,Killahsee Hotel,"Lovely setting and convenient to Naas and surrounding locations. Very friendly, helpful staff. Comfortable rooms. I've been staying for years on business and very happy to recommend it. Nice location for running or a full gym on the grounds if preferred.",5,2021,02,08
218,Disappointing,"The room needed updating, the heat was impossible to turn down so I slept really badly. The hotel just looked and felt dated. The menu in the restaurant was dated and just not good - the food was industrial and unimaginative. Our dinner booking was earlier than we wanted but we had to wait half an hour for our table. 
The pool was dated and needed upgrading. It wasn’t really a four star experience.",2,2020,12,25
218,Lovely Christmas Stay,"I stayed in the Killashee with my family for a night in the run up to Christmas. The service, food and room were all fabulous. We also had use of the spa the next morning as part of our deal which was a nice treat. Will certainly return.",5,2020,12,24
218,"Luxurious, Romantic and Friendly Hotel! However some let downs...","We booked 2 days over the Christmas in a luxury room as part of the “Meal on Us” package. We went with another couple. 
Upon arrival we were extremely impressed, the grounds were gorgeous and hotel was beautiful. 

Upon seeing our room we were really happy. A nice mix of old and new, comfortable beds, nice decor and big bathroom. We also had a lovely big smart tv which we could play Christmas movies on. We had a few minor complaints with the room however, only 2 out of the 9 sockets in the room were working, we had an ironing board but no iron, there was no robes in the wardrobe, one of the lights in the bathroom was broken and kept flickering, every time we flushed the toilet an extremely loud moaning noise could be heard from the pump which meant if one of us popped to the loo during the night it would wake the other person up. For the price paid and the fact it is a 4 star hotel, we wouldn’t expect to encounter these issues, especially from a luxury room. 

The food in the hotel was absolutely fabulous, the salmon starter and the salmon main is to die for. We had 2 vegans with us and their Daal was probably the best I’ve ever had, it’s a shame there is no other mains options for vegans but they were extremely willing to accommodate this by whipping up a nice vegan Christmas dinner. Dessert was yummy too, I recommend the mulled wine pear crumble. 

One huge credit to Killashee is the staff, especially the younger staff, we were always greeted with a smile, and they were so so helpful with any requests. Particular shoutout to Jessica who was extremely friendly, bubbly and has a great sense of humour. She was so helpful with sorting us vegan options! 

Spa was magnificent. Had a wonderful day of relaxation, back massage, facial and floatation bed were all great. 

Overall we had a wonderful stay at Killashee, apart from a few minor things with our room, we’d be more than happy to come back. Thanks for a wonderful stay!

218,Relaxing luxury stay,"From the moment we arrived the staff were so welcoming, friendly and helpful. Stunning hotel in beautiful surroundings and spotlessly clean. Staff were visibly sanitising and it was obvious Covid measure were in place. We dined in the Bistro for dinner and the food was delicious. The breakfast the next morning was fabulous too, with a great selection of cold and hot buffet food or made to order breakfasts. The room was large with 2 comfortable king beds and extremely clean. We went to the spa for massage treatment s and had a wonderful relaxing experience. Would go back in a heartbeat. Loved this hotel and would highly recommend.",5,2020,12,23
218,Beautiful hotel and fantastic staff,"The hotel was amazing from start to finish. Lovely pool and leisure facilities, really tasty breakfast and dinner options, my son loved the butterfly trail and woodland playground and play room! Will definitely return ",5,2020,12,22
218,Lovely hotel,Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff. Clean comfortable and classy. Swimming pool was lovely and I would definitely recommend a stay. Very chilled and couldn't have been more helpful. Location is great ,5,2020,12,22
218,A beautiful night away!,"I booked a night for my boyfriends 30th birthday & it was perfect at every stage! The food was lovely, staff are polite and friendly and the facility’s were great! A quiet hotel in a lovely setting... We will be back! ",5,2020,12,21
218,Weekend retreat,"Driving into the hotel is beautiful with its fantastic driveway and beautiful gardens. The hotel looks amazing from the outside but unfortunately that's where the 4 star treatment finishes. Our room was modest and was not the most clean. Two of towels in the room had what appeared to be blood stains on them. The window would not close fully. The leisure centre is seperate to the general hotel building and you have to walk across a car park to enter the leisure centre. Unfortunately after our swim the key card did not work to get back into the hotel so we needed to walk the entire way around the hotel in the freezing cold in wet shorts. We went for dinner in the bistro in the hotel, the food tasted nice but the portion sizes were rather small. Myself and my husband ordered steak, one was overdone and the other was underdone. Overall I wouldn't stay here again for the price of the rooms.",3,2020,12,20
218,Top notch for Wedding ,Thank you to everybody in Kilashee who helped us celebrate our daughters wedding a few weeks ago during lockdown.  We felt very safe in the hotel and all Covid protocol was in place and practised throughout our stay. Venue was so welcoming with open fires and seasonal decorations. The food was abundant and so tasty. Last but not least the STAFF went over and above the call of duty to look after all our needs. Thank you. Looking forward to next visit. ,5,2020,12,19
218,Liked but not loved,"Pleasant for a short break. Let down a bit by the quality of the food. Beautiful building, lovely surroundings and great staff. We felt safe there during covid times. Obvious guidelines being followed throughout.",4,2020,12,17
218,"Superb hotel, staff and food","Really enjoyed our 2 night stay at Kilashee.  We were 3 adults and 2 children and the hotel has a great balance for all ages. The grounds are lovely, rooms spacious, staff are friendly and helpful and teh food is excellent. Highly recommend and we will return soon",5,2020,12,17
218,Would definitely return!,"Pros- Fantastic hotel. Amazing food! Fabulous cocktails! Lovely Spa, the grounds are beautiful, Staff are so friendly! 

Neg- old style rooms, no long length mirrors in room. Wish there was more to the spa. Another pool or jacuzzi ",5,2020,12,14
218,very pleasant,"An overnight stay, but very enjoyable, very well trained and pleasant staff, Fantastic grounds, nice walks, Hard to find fault, we would stay again and recommend.
The building and history is really nice. The Reception warm and inviting with an open fire in reception. We found the bar well stocked. The rooms are a little far from the main bars and resto. which can be a good thing, unless you have difficulty walking. All in all hard to fault. It seems great for family and kids plenty of space, large reception areas.",5,2020,12,14
218,Afternoon Tea,We attended Christmas afternoon tea this afternoon in your hotel and we were all so impressed.I have been in your hotel on multiple occasions and have always enjoyed. The staff were extremely friendly and couldn't have done enough for us as customers. The food was absolutely delicious and plentiful. The hotel was beautifully decorated and really got us all in the Christmas spirit. One particular lady Olivia was so helpful and friendly and made us feel so welcome. Wishing you and your staff a lovely Christmas and looking forward to a visit in the New Year.,5,2020,12,12
218,Worst breakfast/morning in a hotel,"The hotel itself is very beautifully decorated and our evening was very nice, but the next morning we went down for breakfast which was a completley different story. We booked a slot for 10.45am for breakfast at which time we were there just to be greeted by the most horrible woman (small in height, dark hair) in a managerial role I assume since she was wearing a blazer and walking around as if she owned the place. We walked up and she told us 4 times to close the door behind us because breakfast was over (10.45am), thing is there was people infornt of us and due to social distancing we could not move forward as it would of broke that. The way she was ordering her staff around(do this, do that) made us feel extremley uncomfortable, she treated them with no respect, there was no please or thank you (a bit of manners goes a long way with staff). Then she brought us to our table to tell us there is basically no food left seeing as breakfast is over??(kept repeating this) our time slot was for 10.45am, we did not pay near €200 for 1 night stay for that kind of attitude. I have never met someone so RUDE in a hotel in my life. At one stage she could see we weren’t overly pleased with how she was carrying on at the table and procceed to ask my boyfriend in the most rude in your face attitude ‘are you alright?’. Honestly I have never been made feel so uncomfortable at breakfast and by an employee in such a high role. One lady did make it a little better (tall in height, blonde short hair and glasses) - she couldn’t do enough for us as did the other servers. (04.12.2020-05.12.2020)",1,2020,12,05
218,A Big Thank You,Beautiful hotel and fantastic staff couldn't have asked for more.  Everything was perfect even the weather. Highly recommend for weddings or any special occasion.  Rooms were beautiful and clean.  Kind staff.,5,2020,11,11
218,Outdoor Dining,"Due to the Coronavirus we dined outside here as only outside dining allowed due to the lockdown. It was very comfortable with plenty of heaters and a lovely fire built into the wall.
I had a chicken wrap which was very tasty and daughter had chicken wings, husband had  a green curry. 
Desserts were had by all and were delicious. They can also make a good Irish Coffee here, which is hard to get even in Ireland, so that pleased himself.
Even outside dining is shut down now but as soon as we are allowed to dine out again we will be heading back to Killashee.",5,2020,10,29
218,Very disappointed,"Booked an overnight stay to celebrate our anniversary with dinner, bed and breakfast. Staff were great, the heritage building is charming, gardens are romantic, but this hotel did not deliver on the “gorgeously romantic rooms” or “luxury hotel” experience as advertised on their website.    

Our Superior Room was not what was advertised. The carpet looked outdated, curtain didn’t hang properly and fabric old, damaged with visible torn threads, and the middle sheer curtain for privacy from the carpark was missing.  When you sit in the armchair, the view is an old battered base of the bed. VERY disappointed.  

Gave this feedback to the Manager and appreciate that she offered other rooms, but no point changing to the same style with same old curtains/carpet. Upgrade wasn’t available so we got a free bottle of prosecco to drink in our unromantic room with the curtains as the centrepiece.  

If you are going to remove all room furnishings due to covid, then be honest and update your website with the correct image of the actual room, not a fully styled room with better curtains/carpet.  Or show multiple images of the different rooms so I know what you are offering.  The rooms are far from having a “chic contemporary twist” and “rich luxurious fabrics” so don’t promise what you cannot deliver.  

Chose this hotel and Superior Room based on the photo/description advertised on their “4star luxury hotel” website.  I’m happy to support and am patient with restrictions, but I don’t like being misled with false advertising and the room ruined our stay.  

The website promises a lot of luxury but the reality is more heritage-style old-world comfort.",2,2020,10,24
218,Fabulous Break!!,"Fabulous break! Huge room which was great as we have 2 young kids. Staff were so friendly, kids loved the kids swimming pool, food was excellent, hotel gardens are fantastic. Service was first class- we will absolutely be going back. ",5,2020,10,24
218,Leisure,"Sinead and her staff couldn't do enough for me and my husband,  when I had an accident, through no fault off the hotel .The grounds off the hotel are beautiful as so is the interior.   Thank you for an enjoyable stay",5,2020,10,23
218,Close to Dublin ,Beautiful location with superior hotel only 30mins from Dublin . I’d recommend staying here and enjoy Irish countryside yet close to Dublin and just outside busy town of Naas. You’ll pay lots more to stay in a lesser hotel in the capital!!! Close to Ireland’s only designer retail outlet in n Kildare town. Food excellent. Breakfast was huge !!! Staff all very hospitable. The sure sign of how good a place to a - would I return ? YES,5,2020,10,21
218,Micro Wedding,We had our wedding dinner reception at the Kilashee on 10th October after our original wedding venue cancelled on us a few days before. They could not have been more helpful and accommodating. We are very grateful that they were able to look after us at such short notice. The meal and the service were fantastic. We were even given a bridal suite and the room was immaculate. We can't recommend the Kilashee enough!,5,2020,10,19
218,Overnight dine package,"Fantastic hotel, staff, food, spa. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and accommodating. The hotel was spotless. The food was lovely. Really nice atmosphere, very efficient. Everyone seemed to know what they were doing.",5,2020,10,12
218,Absolutely fantastic,"All I can say is WOW!

Hotel is fantastic. From the moment we drove through the gates we were blown away. 

Staff, food, service and hotel facilities are just amazing.         

I would highly recommend to everyone.",5,2020,10,11
218,I want to rate it higher but I can’t....,"Stayed for a night for a “staycation” getaway. Had really been looking forward to it but it was a bit disappointing. 
From the minute we got there it was hassle trying to get a drink or somewhere to sit whilst waiting to check in. Then we were told the pool and hydro pool was completely booked out. I realise Covid safety measures need to be in place bit you should be asked to book the pool when booking your room. Otherwise they’re falsely advertising facilities you can’t avail of. 

The bistro restaurant was also booked out but they could put us in the terrace restaurant. 
This was the saving grace as although there was nothing glam about the menu, I couldn’t fault the food.
Also credit to the breakfast, all good! Although it does feel like a bit like you’re eating in a canteen. 
Rooms are big but a bit dated. We were freezing in ours but I’ve read other people were too warm. Also second person in the shower gets cold water. 

I really want to be more positive about Irish hotels but they’ve got to up their game.

Praise to the chefs and the bedroom housekeeping staff but please do better with your other front of house team. 
",3,2020,10,08
218,Amazing,"My partner booked us a one night stay in Killashee as a treat to finish off a weekend away else where. All I can say is WOW!! we were blown away by our stay- location, food, spa and most importantly the staff!! 

We arrived early Sunday and our room wasn’t ready (we were way too early, and weren’t expecting it to be ready at all.) The lady at reception was so lovely and said she would call us as soon as it was ready- and she did! 

The staff were beyond friendly and all seemed to get on really well with each other! This is something so small but can change the atmosphere in a place in an instant. I cannot praise them enough from the front desk, wait staff, cleaners and maintenance staff- every single person we encountered had a smile and a hello. They truly are a credit to the hotel! 

Covid restrictions were adhered to throughout the hotel and a lot of thought and care was given to this across the board. The hotel was spotless throughout and there was a member of staff constantly disinfecting the high touch points; doors, lifts etc. As well as this hand sanitising stations were placed throughout the hotel! The room was spotless also and bed was super comfortable! 

The hydrotherapy suite was incredible and so relaxing. I also had a facial in the spa and this too was amazing. 

Food and drink was also beautiful, we had lunch dinner and breakfast and couldn’t fault any of them. Every meal was delicious and portions were ample! As well as this it was very reasonable. 

Could not recommend Killashee enough! We are so disappointed we didn’t have another night booked.",5,2020,10,08
218,Great food and atmosphere,"We had occasion to visit this establishment for dinner last night.
Two parents, three children.
The children opted for burgers, we opted for the rivets steak.
Everything news cooked to perfection.
The staff were attentive but unobtrusive.
The price accurately reflected the quality of the experience.",5,2020,10,02
218,So relaxing 👌,We enjoyed a 2 night stay here in September.  Reception very efficient. Room lovely and clean. All sanitised with statements to that effect. Went to terrace to enjoy sun and a drink but service was poor. Service in dining room both nights was perfect. Breakfast was good when we realised that we needed to wait and order tea and coffee and toast. This wasn’t explained the 1st day. Busy. Choice good. Plates for breakfast could be warmer. Grounds are lovely for walks. More attention could be paid to litter picking. Gym great and swimming pool is super. A lovely place to relax. ,5,2020,09,29
218,Tranquil setting and friendly athmosphere,We went for 1 night and went to the spa and had afternoon tea. It was the perfect break away and just what we needed. We are already looking at dates to book again. Pigsback do great offers for this hotel.,5,2020,09,29
218,"Beautiful building, lovely staff","Stayed here for one night to break up the journey on the way back from Killarney.  Building is very impressive as you come up the drive, I believe it was formerly a convent school. Lots of original features make it interesting. 
We had dinner in the restaurant, it was excellent. 
Very good Covid measures in place, staff were constantly sanitising.
Beautiful drawing/sitting rooms in the original covent part although these seem to be unused except for private functions.  Its a shame as these are such beautiful rooms with views over the gardens. 
The lobby is large with lots of sofas and chairs but was a bit cold, lighting the big fire would have made it much more cosy. 
All in all we had a lovely stay, staff were all so pleasant and helpful, food was excellent. 
If I had to be picky I would say its a bit rough round the edges.",4,2020,09,25
218,Disappointing ,"Stayed for one night, hotel reception lovely but as you go up to room the floor is uneven and carpet very dated. Staff at reception were very welcoming. The room could do with a revamp. The food was terrible for dinner, was cold and waited a while for food to arrive with not a lot of options on the menu. I wouldn't eat dinner there again. Very hard to catch the waiters/waitress attention. Breakfast was nice but it was not explained that you could order stuff off the menu aswell as have the buffet. Gardens are lovely.  Would not stay here again. ",3,2020,09,19
218,Afternoon Tea - terrible ,"Myself and three friends stayed the night here last weekend. We decided to treat ourselves to afternoon tea. This was by the far the worst afternoon tea experience we have had. 

In advance on our booking form via email we requested no fish. The wraps on the afternoon tea platters were made with salmon. This was a bad first impression. 

The food itself was very poor. Bread was hard as if it was left sitting there for a while - didn’t seem fresh at all. The staff member bringing down the afternoon tea platters didn’t explain what the sandwiches were etc like what is done in afternoon tea sittings in other venues.

The service was terrible. We had to wait about ten minutes to get the attention of staff members walking by who didn’t even check up on us. We ordered 3 glasses of Prosecco and the waitress came back with 2. We had to wait about another 10 minutes to get the attention of another waitress to get the third glass of Prosecco. 

When we were finishing up, we asked to pay via card. The waitress said yes no problem and that she will bring the card reader down to us. After thirty minutes we called over a senior member of staff and asked for the card reader and that we had been waiting thirty minutes to pay. She replied and said we have to go downstairs ourselves to pay. 

The service was just terrible, and same with the food. Considering it was €35 each for the afternoon tea, you’d expect a certain standard. This was utterly disappointing. I never write bad reviews but felt this one was necessary.. if anyone is considering coming here for afternoon tea - I’d recommend going somewhere else",1,2020,09,14
218,Disappointing visit ,"Just spent the last night of our holiday here. Unfortunately we were very disappointed given the price and the fact we were travelling with our 3 month old. Service at dinner was disappointing. We had to wait 30 mins in a queue for breakfast, despite booking a time. Waited a further 20 mins for coffee and toast which then came with no milk or butter. There appeared to be no organisation of staff what so ever. The lifts were out of service which left us carrying the pram up and down the stairs. The grounds are beautiful and staff at receptions helpful. Room was also spacious and clean. Not worth the money however. ",2,2020,09,13
218,Hotel stay at killashee,"enjoyed our night away disappointed with our dinner steak was tough and chewy not what you expect for€29.the gardens were lovely, on arrival times for breakfast were not given and no information in the room so had yo come back ourselves to find out ,",3,2020,09,08
218,Excellent stay,In this very strange times if you want a safe environment for a relaxing break then killashee house hotel ticks all the boxes. On check in social distancing was adhered by and was fast. Room was spacious and was spotlessly clean. Food was excellent nd service was very professional. But nicest thing about our stay was beautiful gardens which you sit outside and chill with a beer after dinner. Have to give mention to laura in reception who was so helpful and friendly during our stay.only thing we found slightly uncomfortable was room was very warm at nite otherwise really enjoyed our stay.,4,2020,09,06
218,Amazing food!,"Ordered the picnic box recently for a day trip, everything was delicious and beautifully presented. 
Also visited the same weekend for dinner because we were so impressed with the picnic box! The thai red curry was delicious, so tasty. The covid restrictions in place made for a relaxed dining experience, will definitely be back",5,2020,08,27
218,Excellent place for family with young kids,"Stayed here recently with family. Great facilities , very clean hotel and food in restaurant was excellent. The grounds around the hotel are great to keep  young kids entertainied with butterfly gardens, playground and plenty of paths for walking on. We will definitely look to stay here again.",5,2020,08,16
218,#staycatio2020,"Just returned from a short stay with my family.  I cannot fault the hotel or any of the staff.   I willl be back to this gem of a hotel,  What makes this hotel special , is not the building , but the staff. I dont think I have ever stayed in a hotel where every member of staff where lovely,so  friendly ,so  nice. Kids had a ball on the  zip line in the payground,
Tip. order the Thai red curry in the restaurant. To die for !!!!!!!",5,2020,08,11
218,Brilliant family hotel,"Great big room for a family of 6 , with fantastic space throughout hotel and grounds 
Food was fab and my kids loved it , the loved the pool also , staff where fantastic 
We will be back again to stay and look forward to it ",5,2020,08,10
218,Faultless Stay - Highly Recommended,"Myself, my mum and sister stayed here for 1 night. Food, staff and spa was fantastic. Kilashee should be a role model to other hotels on how to open mid pandemic. We felt so safe at all times. It's clear the hotel cares about their guests immensely and it's so unfair they have to close at this time. ",5,2020,08,10
218,Coping well with Covid,Excellent hotel. Stayed one night. Belated birthday treat. Staff lovely. Felt so safe with all that's going on. Food lovely. Used hydrotherapy pool as spa booked out. Staff explained all Covid policies very well to us on checking in. So sad that the hotel was forced to close yet again...despite all the staffs efforts.,5,2020,08,08
218,Disappointing Stay,"Arrived at Killashee to a very long queue to check in . The queue was actually out into the front of the hotel . 
Upon check in we were asked did we have a reservation for dinner or breakfast . We didn't , as I had been told the day prior when I made the booking that this was not necessary until we arrived. 
The girl proceeded to inform me that dinner would be served in the restaurant and it was a set menu  - no bar food option. So disappointed with this as we were travelling with 2 children and found the menu to be lacking in choice.
We were then told we wouldn't be allowed to have an alcoholic drink if we didn't have dinner in the hotel  - we could however have it delivered to our room. 
However if you did book at table you could have pre dinner drinks for 2 hours prior to your meal and 2 hours after your meal !!!
I also asked at check in about taking out bikes - I was told to come back later and they would arrange it however bikes had to be back in for 7pm - its was 4.30pm at this stage and we had already queued for 30 mins to check in  so we just left it.
We ended up going to our room and then heading into town for dinner.  When we came back to the hotel my husband asked if he would get a drink at the bar and bring it up to the room . He was told no , he would have to order it from the room and get it sent up !!
We ended up sitting in the room at 08.30pm with 2 children !!
It seems the hotel have set up there own rules which clearly benefits them and some what nearly forces people to eat on site if you really want to have a drink and sit downstairs ..
This is our 3rd stay cation in Ireland this summer and its the only hotel we have seen such a set up . 
Overall hugely disappointed and wont be returning.",2,2020,08,06
218,Great night away,"Beautiful grounds to wander around, excellent breakfast and a really enjoyable evening meal with fabulous cocktails. I was very impressed with the service and the staff were very helpful. Definitely worth a visit 😊",5,2020,08,05
218,"Excellent Service, food and staff friendliness",Very good value for money - I booked directly from their website. The service from the staff is 5 stars and the hotel itself is magnificent. The food and service in the restaurant was excellent. I would love to go back.,5,2020,08,04
218,"Luxury 2 night get-away, Great Spa & Breakfast only flaw was we were charged twice for the Room","I booked a 2-night romantic getaway. Upon my booking, I requested a room upgrade, robes in the dressing room for access to the pool and our room to be in a quiet area, after speaking with Niamh in reservations, all our request were approved.

Due to COVID restrictions, we were made aware that rooms would not be cleaned/freshened-up so upon meeting a lovely member of the hotel cleaning staff she guaranteed us that while we were out she would freshen the bedsheets, towels, and tea & coffee stand.

We availed of a massage in the spa and wished we booked in a longer session as the staff were so helpful and kind with complimentary glasses of prosecco upon arrival,

My only flaw was, we were charged twice for the room even though I clearly stated I had the room pre-paid for upon arrival (a refund was received).",4,2020,08,04
218,Wish I could give 6 stars !,Fabulous stay from start to finish. We loved our room and were given a complimentary upgrade to this old world charming suite. The room made the stay. It’s just a notch above. Chandeliers in the bedroom and sitting room with as pictured below .. stunning views. As it was our first stay and anniversary we were hoping that we could have a relaxing stay. The staff were fantastic and very welcoming. We highly recommend the hydrotherapy pool for that ultimate relaxation. No children just relaxing music ! THe grounds are stunning and very well kept. This hotel has a stunning charm and is decorated to very high standards. I recommend the old house although we did ask to see the new build and we’re very impressed with the size and standard of rooms. Overall a very worthwhile weekend and we’re definitely going to visit again. ,5,2020,08,04
218,Disappointing stay,"We have been to Kilashee before and loved it so we’re very excited to go back. We arrived at 14.50 and there was a small queue ahead of us to check in. When we got to the reception desk I asked could we check in for the whole party, 3 rooms, and was told that this wasn’t standard and they would like for everyone to check themselves in. The queue was very large at this point and the reception area was full. I was able to check everyone in but in pandemic times I thought it very strange that they would ask everyone to check in seperalty, this seems very counter intuitive. I was also told that we would be unable to have a drink in the hotel as we had not booked dinner in the hotel. I was unaware this was a procedure when staying in a hotel, as you are paying for residence. I explained that we had a fussy child in our group and so we had booked an early dinner in the town centre but would like to return and hopefully have a drink in the hotel. I was told that this was explicitly not possible and we would all have to return to our rooms and have a drink there. I asked would there be a tray charge on ordering from the bar and couldn’t be given an answer. I enquired about booking a table for dinner as the prospect of arriving back to the hotel at 7.30pm and sitting in our bedrooms seemed depressing, but was told all they had left was 9pm. As we had a 3 year old this was obviously not going to work. If I had booked dinner I would be allowed drink for 2 hours before and 2 hours after my meal. I understand we are in unprecedented time’s but I wish I had been warned of this before booking. I’ve stayed in 2 other hotels where having a drink in the reception and lounge areas was open to all guests. From reading of protocols I don’t understand where management created this rule of a 4 hour drinking window for dining guests but other hotel guests are confined to their room to drink but allow freely roam for all other purposes. I was so disappointed as I had recommended and organised this trip for my family as I was such a big fan of Kilashee. Unfortunately I don’t think we will be returning. I spoke to other guests who were in the same boat as us and we’re also very disappointed.",2,2020,08,03
218,Fantastic Family Hotel,Stayed for 3 nights August 2020. Fantastic hotel. Brilliant staff all round. Really beautiful grounds for walking. Excellent breakfast and restaurant. Very good location. We really had a ball and look forward to our return in the near future.,5,2020,08,03
218,First time in kilashee,"we arrived in kilashee...the reception all was large and airy..very nice. My husband approved the reception desk and was asked to immediately step back for disinfection in a very abrupt manner. He wanted 5 minutes while the receptionist typed on her computer. She then asked for our name and asked when do we want dinner..not if we would like dinner. My husband asked what times were free and she said 9.15...we have two kids aged 7 and 10 so that was not an option. She said abruptly you can eat in yer room!.
She then asked when did we want breakfast..my husband replied 10am..she said not available i will contact you in yer room when i can obtain a time. She gave us the key cards and we went up one elevator across a corridor and into another elevator...down a corridor with dirty carpet and to our room.. The room was very basic and there was no menu in the room...we then decided to eat out for dinner. After dinner we returned to the hotel and I asked in reception if we could get a drink...the same receptionist asked if we had a dinner reservation..to which I replied no. She said proceed to the restaurant they MAY be able to look after you. We proceeded to the bar area next to the restaurant.  I asked if it was possible to get a drink...they girl behind the bar said she would have to ask and disappeared...i said as she walked away is there a food menu...
She returned and asked what we wanted i advised a bottle of.wine and 2 minerals...she said you have to pay for it straight away. I advised that was fine...we sat in the bar area next to the garden where the kids were playing..feeling very unwelcome. There was a wedding party there as well and they were drinking and having fun. They bar lady brought our drink and wanted our name and number for covid tracing...i gave her our room number....
I will never go back to this hotel...we felt so unwelcome..i realise there is a covid-19 protocol..i work in the hse..but the manner in which they treated us was appalling. During the time we sat in the bar...people came and went and got drinks without any hassle with no cleaning procedure between customers...very disappointed 😞",1,2020,07,31
218,First Stay In Killashee,"Generally Positive overall but would have liked to have been able to sample all the various amenities.
service was good and the the Gardens were a welcome addition to take a stroll around.
Lack of the Bar facilities was a draw back plus some Live Music in the evenings would have been welcome.  ",4,2020,07,24
218,An Elegant Afternoon Tea,"I have visited Kilashee House on a number of occasions in the past for lunch or Afternoon Tea.

Myself and a friend visited on a Sunday in July 2020 and I had to post a review on the Afternoon Tea as it was a really lovely experience.

The offering is served in a tiered platter as to be expected. The sandwiches, a mixture of different options from egg salad on brown soda to beef in brioche, salmon with wasabi mayo and goats cheese with onion relish and they were just gorgeous, very well made, tasty, and fresh.

The mini desserts were fabulous, each one elegantly created and again, fresh. The scones were warm with a lovely outer crust and fluffiness on the inside.

I had two different teas; English Breakfast and Earl Grey but they did not charge additional which was nice.

The sitting took place on the gallery which was a little darker than I had expected but it felt elegant all the same.

A lovely experience for just €30 per person.",4,2020,07,22
218,One nighter,Stayed one night with my two children. All was good and staff very friendly. The food was excellent. Try the goats cheese and beetroot salad if you get the chance.Superbly prepared and executed. Pool facilities under restrictions were well managed and the staff overall were very helpful.,4,2020,07,22
218,Great stay,"Had a great stay, upon arrival the receptionist was very friendly and made us feel welcome, all staff we encountered were the same and unlike other recent reviews we had no issues at all. Our room was a 2 x double with a great view of the gardens. The room was clean, nicely decorated and had everything we needed. We asked for water to be sent up to the room and it arrived super quickly with a smile. We didn't need additional soap or towels as we had plenty  I'm sure if we had needed anything all we would have had to do was ask.

We had dinner both nights in the restaurant and yes the menu was reduced but there was ample choice and each of our 3 courses was delicious. Service was totally fine and we really enjoyed both evenings. 

We also had lunch twice and again everything we got was lovely. Breakfast each morning was really good with the limitations for covid. We waited to be seated at the time we had booked and each morning were shown to our table, advised what the options were and offered coffee, toast and hot food. On the buffet section there was orange juice, cereal, fruit, yoghurt and granola etc. The hot food options were full irish breakfast, pancakes (which I had with sausages and bacon on the side) and omelette. The toast was brought to the table with small croissants, wheaten and small danish pastries. The hot food we ordered was very nice, although on the first day it could have been warmer, but not really a big issue. We also asked for extra croissants which came no problem. 

We used the swimming pool which was great and because of the covid limitations really quiet - although make sure to book before you arrive as on check in we were advised it was fully booked. This would have really annoyed me if I hadn't planned ahead, not being able to get a swim when its part of the hotel amenities and perhaps the hotel should consider guest prioritisation.

The hotel grounds are nice for a walk and the place very quiet and relaxing. We had a great stay and would definitely go back, hopefully when things have returned to normal!",5,2020,07,18
218,Using COVID-19 to excuse poor service and limited choice,"Service
The hotel has two restaurants a bistro/bar and another restaurant. The bistro was closed. The remaining restaurant was offering a very limited menu. If they only have one restaurant open why such a limited service in the remaining one?

Breakfast
Basic requests like scrambled eggs weren't possible. Asked for non dairy milk - any non dairy milk - it was never brought the first morning. Asked for magarine instead of butter - never came. The second morning things improved - this time I got some non-dairy milk. The cooked breakfast had cold beans with dried chives sprinkled over everything. The mushroom was unseasoned and cold.  No menus provided. No one said there was breakfast cereals available , had to watch other guests to figure that one out. 

Room
The room we were in was a suite. No air conditioning and the room although having both windows open as wide as they could be wasn't comfortable. There were spill stains on the wall , the sofa had stains on also. It was nasty. 

The walls don't appear to be sound proofed as both nights we were kept awake by the snoring of the guest next door. 

TV didn't work and needed to be replaced.

No extra toiletries were provided / extra clean towels - due to covid 19 they weren't' servicing rooms if you stayed more than a night. Why not provide extra toiletries for guests staying more than 1 night? 

No information was provided in the room. Not even a card with useful information like how to call reception if you needed something , a link to their menus online.

Months of being closed so many things could have been sorted out before opening!! Having stayed in this hotel several times before it was very disappointing experience and for the money paid - not worth it.",2,2020,07,17
218,Using covid as an excuse for poor service.,"This is the hotel that my husband and I were married in, so I am beyond disappointed to have to write such a review. The majority of staff that we encountered were unhelpful and sometimes rude. Our first morning, no one explained to us that there was a cold buffet with the basics, or that we could order hot food. After 10 mins someone arrived to take a hot food order, with no menu i asked for scrambled egg, only to be refused due to a reduced menu! I then asked for porridge and after waiting over half an hour it never arrived. In the meantime i had to ask for a high chair for my 9 month old over 3 times before it arrived. The second day my husband and I availed of room service, he revieved a desert that he didn't order so it was sent back, when we asked for a refund for this upon leaving he was made feel as though he was lying, and told they would just have to take his work for it as THEY misplaced the bill. These may seem like small inconveniences, but when topped off with not being asked how we had slept either morning, or if we required any toiletries or towels or even how our overall stay was upon leaving, it was so disappointing. Hotels are relying on our willingness to stay with them during these strange times and this was certainly no incentive for us to go again.",2,2020,07,17
218,Very unpleasant stay,"Website is very misleading. Highly disappointed with the room, extremely dated. We stayed in a suite, knobs missing, drawers falling apart, curtain over the bed was suffocating. Food only average. Could not wait to get home. Definitely will not be coming back!",1,2020,07,16
218,Great family hotel,"Lovely hotel, lovely grounds. Food was excellent. Could improve with customer service as regards new rules with cleaning of rooms and having available towels and basic room needs. The gym and the pool were fantastic and very clean. ",4,2020,07,16
218,Everything was beautiful. Lovely walks round the gardens and staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was beautiful,Recommend for a couples break just beautiful . Suite we stayed in was lovely and spacious. Little bit dated but we liked the old character to it . We would definitely stay here again and will recommend ,5,2020,07,15
218,Horrific Stay at Killashee hotel,"We would not recommend a stay at this hotel.
The food is not good
The decor is not good
 The attitude of the majority of the serving staff is beyond belief. 
If anyone wants an honest opinion of the Killashee hotel Naas before they book please .. ph 07906131827",1,2020,07,14
218,Not good value for money,Photos are misleading as most of hotel not in  old building. More of a family hotel. Rooms overpriced. Pool fully booked and no priority for guests. Restaurant had more of a canteen vibe than fine dining.,2,2020,07,14
218,Excellent Killashee Hotel break,"Wonderful service - very clean - all Covid-19 sanitisers and procedures in place.
Staff are very pleasant and helpful. The room was exactly as described. 
Breakfast was from a menu (no buffet style due to Covid 19)  - pancakes, omelletes, cooked breakfast etc. ",5,2020,07,10
218,one night stay,Un happy with Covid 19 set up in pool area. Bad draught in the room from the window. No heat on in the room. The food was very good though and the service in the restaurant was also very good. Location was also nice,2,2020,07,07
218,Disappointing stay,"We stayed in the bridal suite and it was very disappointing, the room was very dated, carpets were dirty and there was paint peeling off the walls. I have stayed in the Killashee multiple times and always thoroughly enjoyed my stay, however this time it didnt live up to expectation. The breakfast menu is also way to sparce and the dinner menu is paired back to very basic items. ",2,2020,07,06
218,Beautiful hotel and grounds food not so good,I visited here as a birthday treat with my partner  check in was easy and the room and hotel were beautiful. We stayed bed and breakfast and the buffet breakfast was as expected plentiful and hot. The only bar and restaurant was the bistro. Which was very much set up for eating and not so comfortable if you just fancied a drink the menu was limited which fir a hotel of this size I expected . We ordered a pint of Guinness and a gin and tonic the Guinness was a while coming and hadn't really settled . We ordered food and the presentation was nice however the chips were dark and limp oil needed changing in the fryer which I fed back to the chefs. Later on we ordered room service wwhich was promptly delivered and hot . The chips were better but again the quality of food was not the best . So much so that on our second night we went to the local tesco and had a picnic of our own in the room . Cocktails were €10 each and were ok . However as I said earlier the hotel itself is beautiful the rooms are big and the decor is lovely . Would have loved to stroll round the grounds which looked beautiful but the weather was against us. This is the reason I have given 4 out of 5 rating as the hotel itself made up for the disappointing food. Had it been of a better standard and had we felt more comfortable in the bistro it would have warranted a 5 out of 5 review and a definite return visit.,4,2020,03,22
218,Fabulous midweek getaway,"Stayed at Killashee this week for a Kildare Village shopping spree. Their midweek deals are excellent value for money and the food and service in the bistro were excellent. The staff throughout the hotel are super-friendly and efficient, the rooms spotlessly clean and the gym facilities are great. Would thoroughly recommend the Killashee and hope to be back soon!",5,2020,03,07
218,Great from start to finish. ,"Myself and my partner spent a night here, we upgraded to a suite which I would not recommend as all the rooms seem to be slightly outdated. Very cleans rooms with plenty of space. We both got a spa package which was just amazing, both of our girls were so friendly and made us feel at ease. We had dinner and cocktails in the evening which was delicious. I had the steak and my partner had the burger. Will definitely be back soon. ",5,2020,03,04
218,Night away,"For an enjoyable night away I couldn't recommend the Killashee Hotel more. It boasts a great atmosphere, friendly staff and spacious, comfortable rooms.
It can be pricey and the one night package could probably be a bit cheaper. But overall I'd definitely recommend it.",5,2020,03,03
218,Fabulous Stay,"We attended a wedding and had a fabulous time, our suite was so clean and neat, it made our stay so enjoyable. Absolutely loved the high ceilings and chandeliers, gorgeous finishing touches throughout the whole venue",5,2020,02,24
218,Family wedding,"Excellent hotel, staff, accommodation - would love to return! Lovely atmosphere throughout the buildings and the grounds surrounding. Very pleasant stay! Thank you to all the staff for their kindness and assistance.",5,2020,02,24
218,A lovely stay,"Hotel was very nice breakfast was amazing, very good selection.  Family friendly horel hope to visit again in the future.  The staff were very helpful.  Our room was very spacious and clean plently of towels and toiletries ",5,2020,02,19
218,Some faults but over all Excellent!,"Couldnt find the fancier pool and dinner menu was changed because of valentines day and we were not informed. 
on the other hand, rooms were amazing. lots to do in the hotel and close to Naas and 20 minutes from Kildare village. I will definitely be returning.",4,2020,02,18
218,Amazing,Amazing experience for valentines. The hotel is stunning. Very friendly and helpful staff. Had our dinner in the Bistro and again the staff were so friendly and the food was amazing! We’ll definitely be coming back! ,5,2020,02,17
218,Amazing stay,"From check in trough out our stay, everything was amazing, staff very friendly and professional. Hotel was buzzing. The health club give us the relaxation that we needed. We had dinner in the bar and food, service was so good. Thank you.",5,2020,02,17
218,Birthday,"Key card did not work for any room twice
Dinner cold breakfast cold
Mixup at reception and made planner of event guilty no.apology when cash payment was eventually found next.morning
What was excellent _ staff in dinning room and though spa was.in a different building so you had to.go out in weather was worth the effort
Disappointing as overnight expensive so were expecting great things",2,2020,02,12
218,Horrible experience,Rubbish hotel well overpriced for the quality they provide they cant even put out decent fruit juice in breakfast and rooms stink and windows dont seal so it’s like a wind storm all night never ever want to go back there,1,2020,02,11
218,"Beautiful hotel, lovely building.","We had a beautiful large room, although it was not an upgraded room. Really lovely furniture and decor. 
We had a wheelchair accessible bath(shower) room, complete with grab bars etc which was a little strange and was not mentioned at check in but ok.
The spa was lovely, very big and luxurious. The only downside is the spa and pool / leisure centre is in a separate building which would not suit everyone, especially families with kids.
The dinner menu was very limited, no a la carte, just a set menu with 4 options. 
Breakfast was a bit disappointing, nothing special.
Lovely grounds for a walk. ",4,2020,02,09
218,Everything catered for!,"Stayed recently for a small wedding function. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Food was amazing, simple and done well. Rooms were lovely and would definitely recommend for any occasion! ",5,2020,02,03
218,Relaxing Break Away!  Beautiful Hotel and SPA,"Myself and my partner spent two nights at the hotel.  We stayed in the main house and the rooms were amazing!  On our first day we enjoyed the Urban Retreat Spa Package and relaxed afterwards in the Hydro Therapy Suite.  It was our first time in a dry floatation treatment and as new parents it was just what we needed.  The staff in the Spa and hotel are very nice!  The food in the restaurant was just fine.  
On the second night we had our 10-month old son.  The hotel is extremely family friendly and they have a beautiful play room for children with lots of toys and books and its décor is so charming!

They also have a great gym and swimming pool.  The breakfast was not great unfortunately the milk was gone off and the rashers looked undercooked apart from that the rest of the food was nice.  Looking forward to returning soon!",4,2020,02,03
218,Hotel lacks character and ambience.,"We found the hotel lacked character and ambience. Large reception area was bland and cold although it had a large fireplace which would have added so much warmth wasn’t in use during our visit in January. 
Room was spacious and very clean but looked out on wall of another building and a very long walk from main reception areas. Spa is behind hotel and a bit of a walk and was quite disappointing both in appearance and quality of treatments. Breakfast was a bit of a non event, reception told us breakfast was served until 11. We went down at 10, were promptly seated and lady told us she would take our order for cooked breakfast, there was only 4 other diners in the room and 20 minutes later no sign of her and we ended up leaving. 
An average experience but not one we will be repeating",3,2020,01,31
218,"Overpriced, cold and disappointing","I had saved up to bring my mother on a mother-daughter spa getaway for Christmas. Unfortunately, we were both disapointed. The food, drinks and spa were incredibly expensive and the customer service was definitely not what you'd expect from a 4 star hotel or spa. Our room was stuffy and overheated, whereas the corridors and Turners restaurant were freezing - we had to wear our coats walking around the hotel and throughout most of dinner. The Bistro bar, although expensive, was lovely. However, we had to complain (much against our natures) about our time in Turner's Bar, which we had been looking forward to. I would not recommend.",2,2020,01,28
218,Night away,"Lovely hotel, food was great, leisure centre is fab ,  staff were super friendly from the minute we arrived, so handy to head to kildare village for a bit of shopping also we went to blessington and went walking in the woods beautiful spot you have accessnto so many places within a short distance from the hotel",5,2020,01,28
218,Expensive and disappointing.,"Just back from a stay here and thought I would pop up a brief overview of the stay.

First and foremost, the front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Loved the free newspapers.
The grounds were beautiful and the hotel itself is a really magnificent building. The corriodor and bedrooms were clean, beds comfortable and the bathrooms in good nick albeit extremely cold.

Our first night in the hotel we ate in the bistro. It was fine. Nothing out of this world, floor staff were attentive - there was however unnecessary confusion regarding a tab we had opened. A member of the floor staff insisted we handed our room key and when we went to settle it there was a bit of a furore locating then subsequently getting the key card back. Not the end of the world and resolved relatively quickly. Chalked this down as a genuine mistake and thought no more of it.

The next morning we went down for breakfast (which we had paid for in advance). The cut off for breakfast was at 11 so we got down just after 10 to be safe. We got our teas and coffees and decided to order off the menu as opposed to the buffet. A member of staff took our order around 10.30 and we sat for 30 minutes waiting. Just after 11 we checked on the progress of our breakfast (Eggs Royale x 2) and were informed that our order had never been given to the kitchen and that breakfast was finished. We were offered an omelette which we declined. I would be remiss not to point out that a manager spoke with us and seemed genuinely apologetic for the mix up and had a bottle of prosecco to our room, but at this point given the cost of the stay we were extremely disappointed with the service. Had never had this happen in any other hotel we had stayed in.

Later that night we decided to get room service as the restaurant at the hotel was fully booked. Our food took well over an hour to arrive - we popped 2 calls down to the restaurant to check the status both times we were told it would be checked and the phone was put down. When it did arrive both starters and one of the main courses were actually cold. A Bottle of water we requested specifically was forgotten and member of staff had to go back down for it.

Following morning we had ordered Breakfast in bed - it arrived very quickly to be fair  However, once again the food was freezing once it arrived and the toast was completely burnt although unsurprisingly cold.

Would not stay here again. Alot better places out there for a similar price range.

As a result of the breakfast fiasco, we did however discover a lovely little gem for brunch in Naas called Grace's. 

",1,2020,01,26
218,Mother and Daughter Day,"We both had treatments in the Spa, myself a shoulder, arm and hand massage and finished off with shellac nails. My only complaint was that I found the spa a bit dark for my liking, maybe that is just me because my daughter liked the darkness and found it quite relaxing. She opted for a facial and a back massage and said it was one of the best massages she ever had.
Afterwards we rewarded ourselves with lunch in the Bistro, here we both had chicken wraps with salad and toffee pecan pie, both were lovely and served by some very pleasant staff who seemed to be happy in their job.
Killashee is a beautiful old building and I actually attended my nephews communion there when it was a school, the grounds are beautiful and it has a good location close to The Curragh, Kildare Village Shopping Outlet and the lovely town of Naas which has plenty of shops and restaurants.
We are already looking forward to our next visit.",4,2020,01,21
218,Underwheming,"Our room wasn’t overly clean, stains on the window and window ledge, tv in the press and cannot be seen by everyone when in bed! Asked for a dessert plate to be left in room as it was my mother’s 50th birthday, this was not in our room upon arrival, even though we checked in at 3.30 (check in at 3). Room design was rather underwhelming and bathroom was tiny! I had to ring to request the dessert plate again upon arrival and was so disappointed when it did come, no mention of the birthday, just welcome to Killashee Hotel wrote on the plate in chocolate, very disappointing! We went to the hydrotherapy suite, which he had to pay €10 into, really not worth the extra charge, not enough places to sit or lay around, only 8 lounge chairs provided! Furthermore access to the pool and spa for hotel guests is a joke, you have to walk outside to gain access! We got soaked walking back in!! So disappointed with our stay.",2,2020,01,21
218,Girls weekend away,"When we arrived at the hotel, all was good, the girls at reception were friendly and accommodating with the group. Two of the party arrived later than everyone else and checked in. We discovered later that we had overpaid the bill and I decided to pop down to reception to check it out only to be told, to my surprise, that we owed money. I tried to sort it out with them and was given a bill that I couldn't make sense of. I was told that they only had a record of card payments and not cash which seemed strange to me. I met another person at reception who kindly said she would look into it and come back to me - it could have been a cash payment. I never heard anything back that night. I had to go back to the group and ask how they all paid which was a bit embarrassing. I went down the next morning to reception to explain that one of the girls had paid cash to try and resolve the issue. Went through my issue again, was being made feel that it was a fault on our side and finally got to the bottom of it and was told that the til was up last night and the person who overpaid just needs to pop down to be refunded... no apology given, disappointed with the customer service. There was also a poor customer service at dinner, it was hard to get a hold of the waiting staff. Tea and coffees arrived but no milk and sugar was in the table, had to get the attention of the waiting staff twice. We had to ask for extra water for our table. Service was very long and some of our food arrived cold. I feel like there was a lack of ownership with the problems we incurred.",1,2020,01,19
218,Extrelemly disappointed,"Very disappointed with your standards....windows had large gaps,which made bedrooms extremely cold. Shower tray overflowed due 2 blockage. Made 2 attempts to complain  but nobody listened.  Wont be back",1,2020,01,17
218,5 Star All The Way,Have visited Killashee a number of times over the years and it is consistently excellent.  From the start with the warm welcoming staff and the open fire in reception to the dining experience in the capable hands of Head Chef Seamus Commons cannot recommend highly enough.,5,2020,01,15
218,Excellent ,"Really enjoyable one night stay for New Year’s Eve. We went with our 3 children and another family. Six children in total had a fantastic time. Relaxed family-friendly atmosphere. Excellent food, spotlessly clean, very friendly professional staff. Highly recommend. ",5,2020,01,15
218,A great place to stay & enjoy,Yet another trip to my favourite hotel. Standard are as high as ever. The most convenient high grade accommodation near Punchestown reces. Great staff beautiful setting will always return at every opportunity ,5,2020,01,15
218,A true joy ,"It’s like a fairytale - so many beautiful spots, amazing customer service and very tasty and hot food served to 100 peoples. Every single staff is smiling, helpful and really care for you to have an enjoyable trip. 

Did not find time for the Spa due to working time there but definitely a spot to revisit in the spring/summer time. 

Will definitely be returning! ",5,2020,01,13
218,Niece Wedding ,Beautiful hotel outside Naas. Old boarding school. You walk into a grand hall with plenty of seating areas.  Wedding meal was very tasty and presented beautifully.  Settings including the gardens are well worth a visit. Great choice at breakfast. Porridge very tasty. Staff all over were friendly.  Food in bar/restaurant was fresh and tasty but pricey. Disappointed that we could not order a sandwich at 10pm...kitchen has to close sometime. Beds nice and big and comfortable. I slept well. Well worth a visit.,5,2020,01,12
218,Fab!! ,"We spent the night here on the 2nd of January, and we loved it. The room was lovely, dinner was fab. There was a bit of a queue for breakfast in the morning, but we seemed to be down just in time to get in before it got very long, but the hotel did seem to be extremely busy that morning. We were even more delighted to be given a 10% off card for Kildare Village when we mentioned at check out we were heading there that day! ",5,2020,01,11
218,First Class,We had a very enjoyable & comfortable stay in one of the family rooms.  We attended a family wedding over two nights. Top class food.  Very friendly & helpful staff.  Lovely surroundings. Highly recommend ,5,2020,01,07
218,Just outstanding ,"Can’t say enough about the staff! From the spa to the lobby to the restaurant all the staff were just great!  Food was very very good and if your thinking about coming here quit thinking and come here! 

A must see place with an elegant charm!   5 stars all the way!! ",5,2020,01,05
218,Beautiful Olde world hotel,"Beautiful building with loads of seating areas. Rooms are somewhat 'all over the place', so for those not very mobile look for a ground floor room, avoid level 2. The beds were very comfortable with lovely soft bedding and pillows.  the gardens are lovely. Dinner very nice but breakfast disappointing. Spa a bit of a walk from hotel so wear a coat during the winter.  ",4,2020,01,04
218,Fabulous place but breakfast needs improvement,"Kilashee has the wow factor when you walk in. The place is really beautiful. It is a plus that it has a leisure centre but it is in a separate building to the hotel. The staff were friendly and the rooms were clean. Both my husband and I felt the breakfast was poor. There was a wedding on when we were there and you could hear the noise from it from the bedrooms. However, we still managed to fall asleep.",4,2020,01,02
218,Beautiful Hotel on fantastic grounds,This is a gorgeous hotel with lovely grounds on the outskirts of Naas. Rooms are very well equipped.  We ate in The Bistro where the food was delicious but service was a little slow.  The hotel is only 20 minutes drive from Kildare Village shopping outlet and 30 mins from Dublin so the location is great!,4,2020,01,01
218,Christmas break,"Excellent stay here as a family. Very spacious room, 2 double beds and one single for a family of 4. Kids were delighted. Room was located far from reception which meant it was quiet at night despite all the weddings downstairs. Worth requesting before arrival.
Spa was a great treat. Theresa was excellent for a deep tissue massage. Very relaxing. Pool for spa members and a larger pool for others. I joined the kids in the pool after my treatment which was great fun. 
Pity it’s not part of the hotel but not far too walk outside. 2 Lobby areas so perfect to meet friends for a drink. 
Breakfast was ok. Perhaps they need to select better sausages and rashers. 
Felt it was reheated for ages. 
Overall I would come back. ",5,2019,12,29
218,Still amazing after all these years,"Had our wedding reception here back in early 00's. We have returned a few times over the years since and always had a great time.

Now so close to Kildare Village, so many reasons to return more often. A++++",5,2019,12,24
218,Bad Experience,The cooked breakfast was cold on both days.There were previous occupants clothes in the room when we entered.The bottom sheet didn't fit the bed.The pillows are made of synthetic material.The safe is not bolted to anything. Somebody tried to enter the room at midnight on the first night and appeared to have a genuine entry card and only for the door being locked on the inside they would have gained access,1,2019,12,24
218,One night stay at Kilashee,"Excellent hotel could not fault it in any way. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room’s spotlessly clean and comfortable. Food delicious great selection for breakfast. Nice location, hope to revisit “Kilashee” very soon. ",5,2019,12,23
218,Luxurious stay,"Kilashee Hotel was breathtaking in appearance from the onset. The building, design by Turner, has such amazingly stunning features, it was impossible to take it all in on one overnight stay. The staff were local, friendly and couldn't have been more helpful and accommodation. My suite was 5 star rating wonderful! ",5,2019,12,13
218,Top Notch,I went here a few months ago to catch up with some friends. Fab spot! Lots of little nooks and crannys to sit and have a good chat. Food was excellent and a good price. Location was fabulous. Staff were friendly and didn't try to push us out to make room for the next customer...you could spend hours here!,5,2019,12,11
218,Excellent ,"Just stopped in this morning for coffees and scones. We were directed to the conservatory where our order was taken. Scones were served fresh and warm with jam,butter and cream. The hotel was very festive and lovely and warm. 
Looking forward to next visit",5,2019,12,07
218,Disappointing rooms,Found the bedroom disappointing. Although it was a decent size the furnishing was very tired and dated. Bathroom also needed revamping plus the cold tap wouldn’t turn off completely so kept dripping. There were two double beds in the room but they weren’t very comfortable.  One plus though the food was delicious.,3,2019,12,01
218,Fabulous Location with Delicious Food and Excellent Service,"I attended for business purposes and everything was excellent, staff were friendly and helpful, food and service excellent. We ordered breakfast to our room and it arrived hot and tasted delicious.  I could not fault a thing throughout my stay. ",5,2019,11,26
218,"Good accommodation and leisure centre, great for a quiet weekend",Don't eat the breakfast sausages - they are awful - but the poached eggs are excellent. Food is good and Naas nearby also has some excellent eateries. It is conveniently located close to the Motorway and Dublin (except I came from Galway!!). Kildare village is nearby and there are good tourist stuff.,4,2019,11,26
218,Very enjoyable experience,"I recently stayed over at a luncheon event. It was just wonderful, the grounds, the hotel, the staff, the ambience was fab the minute I arrived despite the aful weather. 
Like stepping into another world for a few days.  ",5,2019,11,25
218,Killashee Hotel event,What a lovely hotel. The garden walks are magnificent and worth visiting on their own! The hotel building is an old Country House-style with beautiful architecture. Great facilities loo cities too. Well worth a visit. Just South of Naas on a Regional Road.,5,2019,11,23
218,A beautiful building,We stayed here in November the food was amazing so fresh the staff are so helpful and pleasant the room wasn't great but everything else was fine the spa is really lovely just to and relax for a few hours we really enjoy our stay,4,2019,11,20
218,Disappointing midweek break at the Killashee hotel,"We recently spent a midweek break in the Killashee House hotel.  Driving up the avenue to the hotel we were very impressed. It is a beautiful old-world property with lovely gardens.  However, the reception/lobby area was cold and unwelcoming.  There is a lovely old fireplace in it, but no fire was lit.  Small detail but what a huge difference it would have made on a cold Nov. evening.  
Our stay was disappointing because over the 3 days we were limited to our bedroom, the lobby area and the Bistro/bar.  The hotel is quite large and interesting but rooms such as the Drawing Room, Parlour, Conservatory, Turners restaurant and upstairs guest bar were either closed or were in use by Conferences which were taking place in the hotel midweek.  There was nowhere to sit and read comfortably or to have a quiet coffee.  If only the fire was lit in the lobby area it would have created an ambiance inducive to one sitting and having a drink or coffee.  As it was this area was cold and uninviting.  I did ask for it to be lit on our final evening after we had dinner and what a difference it made.  
Due to the conferences, Turners restaurant was closed to guests which meant we had to have breakfast and dinner each day in the Bistro/Bar. This was a bit monotonous. Choice for dinner was poor but on the whole food was good.  
I understand that conferences are big business to the Killashee mid-week but we felt like 2nd class guests.  We had expected full access to the hotel's facilities as per their website.
However, I must commend the staff, they were all very friendly, helpful and professional, especially Glen. Also, the bedroom was warm and clean and the beds comfortable.
I am sure one would have a better experience at the weekend, but I am afraid I will not be returning midweek.
",3,2019,11,19
218,Food in Bistro,"I travelled with my friend for a girlie day trip to the spa. After a lovely few hours in the spa we decided to head into the bistro for food.  What a disappointment!!  We both ordered the burger and chips. I was a little taken back at the price €18.50 for a burger and chips but assumed we would get top notch food. 
Our food arrived... literally a small burger on a brioche bun with cheese and a sauce and a small bucket of chips. The burger was tasty . The chips were unpeeled potatoes not very warm and had a black appearance as if they had been left to sit. Even the taste was odd. How they can justify charging  €18.50 is beyond me. There were very few people that Friday afternoon in the bistro and I am not surprised. A nice day out was ruined by serving over priced mediocre food.  Would not recommend  the bistro , plenty of nicer places in naas with much better value.",1,2019,11,17
218,Comm ball and breakfast ,Naas being the impressive town it is I expected nothing short of a 5 star standards from killashee hotel. I’d like to remark on the quality of the service from the breakfast staff Keith and Ultan. Xoxo,5,2019,11,16
218,Nice old style hotel,Enjoyed my stay here for a brief business trip. ITs a former convent so the hotel has plenty of character. Rooms were nice and spacious. Food was excellent. Service and staff were very good also. Recommend.,5,2019,11,14
218,Killashee Hotel set in lovely gardens,"This was my third visit to Killashee Hotel and once again the hotel lived up to expectations, all the staff are polite, friendly and helpful.   Breakfast was very tasty along with other meals I enjoyed at the hotel, spacious bedroom, comfortable bed, good shower, free WiFi and lovely grounds.  Could ask for no more.",4,2019,11,12
218,Exactly what we needed!!,"From the we arrived the whole experience was fabulous!  From Louise on reception making us very welcome to Sanjeev in the bar making the most tasty Black Russians. The food in the bar was faultless, generous portions and perfectly cooked.  Room service breakfast was hot and tasty and again perfectly cooked!  Our one night get away was exactly what we needed to recharge our batteries!",5,2019,11,11
218,Salvin wedding,Amazing venue food was excellent and staff and service was amazing when we got there the whole lot of the wedding guests were checking in but the reception staff were so organised  and friendly that they flew through the queue now the way to the bedrooms took a bit of concentration but once you got sorted it was easy would definitely recommend this hotel and we’ll definitely be back,5,2019,11,08
218,Excellent hotel great service..,"Stayed here with my wife for one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
The hotel is old Victorian school building full of history with beautiful gardens and woodland trails, on our arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was a fantastic surprise, it was very kind of the hotel staff do this for myself and my wife. They have two restaurants, turners restaurant and the bistro, we had a meal in the bistro, the food was top notch. the interior of the hotel is like an old castle, the place is kept very clean and the staff are friendly, helpful and professional, there is also a leisure centre with pool, sauna, jacuzzi, gym etc, we had a great time from start to finish,  definitely recommended ",5,2019,11,05
218,Check in and out were embarrassing ,"I brought a large group of ladies to the hotel for an event I was hosting. 

The hotel is fabulous and the decor is just beautiful. The belling suite was perfect for the event. 

I decided to stay an extra night to make my life easier. I rang the spa that day to try and make a reservation, spend money, I love Elemis , the voice mail said they would get straight back to me. They didn’t ever ring! 

On check in there was severe confusion and I was told I had not paid. I explained that I was adding on a night and only needed to pay for that. The girl I was dealing with walked off and then took a phone call and began to deal with other guests . 
Meghan had to pick up the pieces. She was doing her best. 

Eventually sales confirmed that I had paid and only needed to pay for their extra night..

The bistro staff were lovely , I had a very nice dinner. Breakfast was good and the young team of staff were working hard. 

Stephen and his team in Conference and banquet were excellent and couldn’t do enough . 

Group dinner - the manager whispered to me there was problem and there would be no vegetables included in the table d’hotel menu that I had arranged. She said she couldn’t give me veg as the chef would be angry and it would affect his gross profit. I told her to put veg on the table and I would sort it out. My group were drinking  well and had spent a lot in the spa. I had paid in full more than one month in advance of the trip. I was charged €8 for vegetables for the group which makes me wonder why you bothered charging me at all? I tried to spend money in the spa and couldn’t then got charged a measly €8 for veg! 

Breakfast was great the next day we had a private area and it was super. The staff were excellent. 

Upon check out I was called back and informed there was €20 outstanding on my bill.... they had made a mistake when I checked in and charged me the wrong price. Again poor Meghan on reception was left to deal with it. Mean while there were plenty of onlookers. 

The duty manger came and was of no help. I ended up getting annoyed with her as I felt that the hotel really let themselves down with regards to money. I wanted to spend money in the spa and couldn’t, i stayed an extra night and had extra food and drink, I was hassled for €8 for vegetables and then asked to pay for their mistakes. 

The hotel staff in the bar and restaurants are all great , the facilities are excellent it just seams money/ check in / out is a real issue. 

I was sent a feedback form after my event which I filled in and heard nothing back from. I also rang the general manager and left a message .. it’s now 4 weeks and no one has returned my call... 

It is a beautiful hotel and I would recommend it but just be sure to bring all your confirmation emails with you. Double check the payments. 

Otherwise it is fantastic, clean , lovely gardens, the belling suite is beautiful. My group all had a fantastic time and thankfully there was no issue with any of them / their bills or their spa appointments. I will bring a group back there another time but I will ensure there is vegetables included ! 

",3,2019,11,04
218,Weekend away,"This weekend began on Friday lunchtime. My first time to visit this hotel!! What an amazing experience! On our arrival at reception the amazing Imogen looked after our check-in  in a very pleasent and efficient manner. Answering all our questions confidently and assureingly, immediately putting in a feel good frame of mind. The rooms were of a particularly high standard with all the usual extras and needlessly to say spotlessly clean!! I have to add that it was noticeable that all the staff we encountered during our visit were extremely friendly. 
On Saturday we decided to try out the Killashee Spa!! This Spa offers a full range of treatments. Again this was a first for me!! And I wasn't disappointed! A totally relaxing experience!! Would highly recommend the Dry Floatation room and the amazing Rasul, a middle Eastern style steam room!! A big shout out for Leanne who treated us like royalty while in the Spa!! 
Finally we decided to stay in the Hotel for Saturday night rather than go into the local town. We decided to eat in the Bistro. The menu here was not expansive but the food was absolutely amazing!! I would highly recommend the pan fried Hake!! Our server for the night was the wonderful Aoife who, from the taking our order to clearing our table was bubbly, fun and informative of the food on offer!! A great asset to this restaurant!! 
All in all an amazing weekend experience!! 

PS, the hotel is approx 10 minutes from the nearest town (Naas). The taxi fare will set you back €10. ",5,2019,11,04
218,2 night stay in a hidden gem ,"I loved everything about this hotel. The beautiful butterfly garden, the water fountain. The playground for my 3 year old. The beautiful gothic exterior of the main part of the hotel. The inside is so relaxing and comfortable with beautiful design. The pool is great. Look forward to staying here again also close to kildare villege for a spot of shopping. Thanks for making our stay enjoyable. ",5,2019,11,03
218,Engagement in KILLASHEE,"We got engaged in Kilashee the last week of October and it was great. The reception staff could not have been nicer. For the life of me i cannot recall the name of the one lady on reception that was more than helpfull. Im so sorry i cannot remember the name i feel so bad because she deserves recogition. If you can figure it out please relay this to her she might remember us because i spoke to her a few times and we stayed in the beautiful 303. Any thing we needed she took care of. We ate in the bistro and the bar staff there made the greatest mohito's. In the resteraunt on Saturday we were given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco to celebrate the engagement . The Steak in the resaurant was so good it was perfect. The staff in the restaurant deserve a shout out too. The table next to us was a man a woman celebrating her birthday and a small child. The little girl got upset that it wasnt her birthday when the cake arrived and the maganager was so helpfull to them . We work in a hotel all so and i was very much impressed by the professionalism. As a receptionist i feel the reception staff were the unsung hero's in Kilashee amazing.

Also one thing if you are celebrating a special occasion like we were i cannot recommend kilashee enough.",5,2019,11,02
218,Halloween Break ,"Spent a night here with my wife, fabulous hotel on lovely grounds in lovely area, very secure for families with kids. Exceptional decor and furnishing. Not expensive B & B for €150 which I think is very reasonable for such a lovely hotel. Hab luch in their restaurant fabulous, the desert I had was the best desert I've ever had. Lovely staff, extremely clean and fine sized rooms  I'm disabled so it is very disabled friendly. ",5,2019,10,30
218,Family break,We had a large family room which comfortably fitted our family of 6. Grounds were a joy to explore. Hadn't used a little kids club before but confidently used this one. All staff were helpful and friendly,5,2019,10,30
218,Fantastic Evening,"We had a 65th birthday celebration in the Killahsee Hotel - Moore Abbey room over the weekend. A very quiet room just off a courtyard. Had its own small bar. We had 20 sitting for dinner but the room would probably accommodate twice that number. Our grandchildren took up the rest of our room for the night. Duty manager Glen, Kelly and Christopher couldn't have been more accommodating. Food was excellent. We stayed overnight in a large double room. The only negative in the room was the lack of hot water. Other that that I would have give it a 5 star. Little busy on checking in, but reception staff managed a very large wedding party well. All staff in the hotel were excellent and very professional. We would highly recommend this venue.",4,2019,10,29
218,Very welcoming and homely!!,"From the moment we walked in the door of Kilashee Hotel we felt welcome. It is a very cosy hotel with a very inviting foyer area.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and even though there were lots of kids it didn't feel noisy.  The room was beautiful, comfortable and the bed linen and beds were of a high standard.  The staff were extremely helpful and obliging.  Many of the breakfast staff were young people and they were excellent. Everything was possible, you just had to ask. The gardens and walks were beautiful with lots to do.  We didn't have time to avail of kids club or leisure centre as our break was short but it was very enjoyable and relaxing.  I would go back again in a flash as we have lots more to see and do in the Kildare area.",5,2019,10,29
218,Wedding,"Recently attended a family wedding. All very impressive, but special commendation to the pastry chef- both starters and dessert were delicious. Really crisp and perfect, despite the big numbers. Will be back.",5,2019,10,28
218,Nice stay,"This hotel falls down mainly on the bedrooms. We paid for a superior room but the room was tired and in need of some TLC. We arrived on a very wet and cold day but on entering our room we found the window wide open and the heating off. This problem was simply rectified by reception (we were informed heating had been boosted from downstairs).
Another downfall was that our showers were tepid in the morning (borderline cold)...this to me is an absolute no no!!
The waiting staff were excellent and the hotel exterior, lobby and gardens are very impressive but unfortunately the bedroom let it down for me.",3,2019,10,22
218,Fantastic Experience,"Fantastic stay. 
It was my second time staying here and both occasions were perfect, very friendly staff, exceptionally clean room and overall a lovely experience. Reception team were excellent. This morning I had an early start and a taxi pre booked for 5.50, only to wake it it being cancelled. I went to reception and they made several attempts to obtain another for me, with no success. 
Then Conrad and Nick did something exceptionally kind and offered to drive me. 
I was astonished by their kindness.
What an amazing customer experience!!!!!!
Huge thank you.",5,2019,10,22
218,Old world charmq,"Stayed overnight here with my husband and our 5 year old on our way to Cork.  My husband used to go to school here when it was a convent school so it was a great trip down memory lane for him.  Beautiful property, absolutely fantastic grounds that we explored late afternoon and early morning.  

Arrived at 2 but told room wouldn’t be ready till 3, which was fine by us as we fancied a drink in the bar.  Staff were fantastic.  I did think the bar lacked a bit of atmosphere, inaudible background music and just felt a bit lacking of something that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.     Our room was fabulous, large and spacious, overlooking the beautiful grounds.  We had Dinner in The Bistro and the food was fab, we went for the specials and couldn’t fault them, thought again the atmosphere was still a bit lacking.  Great sleep, lovely dark rooms, breakfast in the morning was served in The Bistro, breakfast was great, buffet and al la carte options, again the restaurant was a bit lacking. Almost like it didn’t know what it wanted to be olde world or Morden bistro.  But honestly the place is a must do if you like some charm.  Will definitely be back. ",4,2019,10,21
218,Old world wonder,"I stayed in the room 185. , Beatrix, while on a business away day, nice old world room, big sash windows overlooking entrance area, great little snug bar, nice grounds with attentive friendly staff, would stay here agains",4,2019,10,18
218,Fabulous Kilashee,"Wonderful hotel, fantastic food. Extremely friendly staff. Huge beds, we booked a twin so were quiet surprised to get a double each. Could not fault this hotel. We will definitely be back sooner rather than later. ",5,2019,10,18
218,girls weekend,"We had an early Christmas night out Saturday October 12th 2019 with three girlfriends from kilkenny so the hotel was far enough as an overnight trip but not too far for travelling. The venue is close to Newbridge and KIldare village shopping so after a hetic day it was bliss to relax in our very spacious bedrooms, have a drink before dinner and an absolutely amazing meal in Turners Restaurant.",5,2019,10,15
218,Would not re book or recommend,"The building is old and the furniture is outdated. Who puts the TV in a cupboard?! However I am not a big fan of vintage style.
I was booked in a room with 3 bed which I complained about but got no solution.
Dinner was ok but had to wait for 50min to get my food and breakfast is very poor.",1,2019,10,14
218,Wedding Guest,"Beautiful venue from the outside and the original house, where the wedding reception drinks were held, was stunning. Unfortunately the venue was so very cold, the gorgeous open fires rather than being lit were filled with candles. 
The wedding was held in the Thompson suite, it too was very cold and even when filled with 200 guests did not warm up. Food was very average, chicken tartlet starter was scrumptious, soup good, meat on main course good but vegetables were raw rather than the intended al dente. Though extra veg was offered no extra gravy was provided. The assiette of desert was disappointing, all three offerings, crumble, cheese cake, and lemon meringue pie were far too sharp and though a desert lover I left all three. 
The guests room were very drab, nothing opulent or luxurious about them, bedding was fine. I had to call reception to get the heating turned on as like the rest of the hotel the room was cold too, it did eventually warm up. 
Ordered breakfast to our room, again a disappointing affair. Croissants and pastries below par, toast undercooked and cold. I had pancakes and though they tasted yummy they were also cold. My husband had a cooked breakfast, ingredients were of very good quality and though warmer than my pancakes it wasn’t hot. 
Overall a very under whelming experience and one I certainly wouldn’t pay €180 for again!",3,2019,10,12
218,Amazing ,"A final stay after a footsteps of St Patrick’s pilgrimage of Ireland .
This oasis was perfect with a beautiful ambiance and wonderful facilities.
Rooms are large and well appointed. The beautiful renovations, facilities, gardens and conservation make this a wonderful place to stay.",5,2019,10,08
218,Perfect anniversary celebration!,"We were at Killashee for a night to celebrate my boyfriend’s parents 45th anniversary and all of us were so impressed by this lovely spot! The suites were gorgeous; all individually decorated and super spacious! The house itself was absolutely stunning; we spent several hours enjoying drinks in the conservatory then wandering around and taking in the beautiful space (and interesting history!). The grounds were probably my favorite. Peaceful and perfectly maintained with hidden gems everywhere you turn (like the colorfully tiled picnic house, gazebos wrapped in vine, and beautiful views of the main house). Dinner at the bistro was good. It was overpriced but it’s a hotel, so you kind of expect that. Great chips. 
I can also highly recommend the spa, which was beautifully appointed with fantastic stuff. I had a lovely massage. All in all, this is a really special game pace for any kind of occasion. It was a lovely spot for a bit of a celebration. ",5,2019,10,07
218,Short Stay,"Ask for details of your room before your stay as some of the rooms are quite dated with decor only. Beds are very comfy.  Definitely try out the Hydrotherapy suite in the Spa. this is in a seperate building.
The Terayaki chicken wings are highly recommended. 
",4,2019,09,30
218,Stayed here for a wedding,"An absolutely beautiful hotel, even as you approach it it looks amazing. The rooms are spacious and the beds comfortable.  The wedding reception food was amazing and the breakfast was unbelievable. Everything you could possibly imagine when you think of breakfast. The staff were friendly and very helpful. A great place to stay for a special occasion.",4,2019,09,29
218,Nice Property,"Beautiful main building but rooms can be in a comparatively lesser wing.  Ours was a tad reminiscent of a moderate chain than the elegance of many of the other rooms.  Not bad, but.  The meals were very good, staff helpful but it seems one's experience can vary.  The grounds are beautiful.",4,2019,09,28
218,"Very friendly staff, great location and","Very friendly staff, great location and nice and spacious rooms. Nice breakfast. The area and gardens are wonderful. Really and wonderful place to stay for a private visit or to organize an event. Conclusion: go for it",5,2019,09,22
218,Nice hotel but not for gluten free,"My friend & i stayed for 1 night and hotel is very impressive on arrival. On entering room the smell of drains was atrocious but after complaining to reception the smell decreased.
Beds were comfy but I would have expected a separate shower (not shower head over bath) in that standard of hotel.
My friend is gluten free & I asked on booking about GF options and was told there was a separate menu.  Not so.....  only 2 options on menu of bistro for GF!! This really disappointed us.  
Steak was lovely and deserts were nice too.
Breakfast was nice with good choices but not for GF again!!  Took 15 minutes to get some GF toast and it wasn’t busy.
Otherwise hotel is nice & clean & quiet with lovely gardens but due to disappointment with GF we wont be back",4,2019,09,22
218,Beautiful hotel just outstanding.,I loved everything about the hotel can’t fault it at all. Such amazing place to stay. The location is so quiet and peaceful. The room was so spacious and beautifully decorated. I loved the breakfast amazing. ,5,2019,09,21
218,AMAZING HOTEL. EXCEPTIONAL STAFF,"Killashee is one of our favorite Hotels and it never disappoints. I had the most amazing treatments with Sinead. She is an exceptional therapist and looked after me so well. I had the best night sleep after my relaxing spa experience. The Spa Manager Eva is such an ambassador for the Hotel. We had dinner in the Bistro. The food was delicious and we were looked after so well by Conor. He is so attentive and friendly. The ambiance across the Hotel is so relaxed and it has such a home away from home feel to it. The room was immaculate and very well maintained, and we enjoyed the gardens, The fairy garden and playground is such a great extra for children. Our 3 year old loved it. Once again, thank you to the entire team at Killashee for the best weekend. We can't wait to return.",5,2019,09,17
218,Stunning hotel and location,"It is a beautiful setting for a wedding.  The staff were so friendly and helpful, really couldn't do enough, especially Brian.  The rooms in the old house are beautiful and a very good size.  The food was also fabulous. ",5,2019,09,17
218,Lovely hotel but over priced and food was very varied,Lovely hotel but over priced and food was very varied - staff were great - grounds are beautiful. the Duck was very dry which we told them and the breakfast the first morning in particular was poor although the eggs ordered freshly cooked were good. ,3,2019,09,17
218,"Great Hotel,  But their food let's them down so badly","I like this hotels amenities, rooms are good, the grounds and Gym,&  Spa are fabulous, but the bar lacks atmosphere, and the food , well the food is just not improving. They could do so so much better. Many people I talk to feel the same, and most guests prefer to eat in the many wonderful restaurants in Naas. Come on Killashee hotel, if you can raise your game in this department this place will be so popular.",3,2019,09,11

218,Nice hotel but avoid the bar food.,"I love this hotel and have stayed many times. There has always been a few things not perfect with the bar food/restaurant when we eat there. This time was a disaster......blood 9n the b9ne of the chicken dish, part of order never arrived even though we asked 3 times and a drink we ordered that never arrived was on the bill. The staff were very pleasant about it and apologised but I don't think I'll be going back again unfortunately.",3,2019,09,06
218,Beautiful wedding venue,We attended a wedding weekend at this fabulous hotel . It was a fantastic weekend from start to finish . Such a welcoming venue and I will look forward to returning. The staff were keen to please and the food was beautiful! Thank you ! ,5,2019,09,03
218,Wedding heaven,"Here for a wedding and from reception till we left two days later the staff could not have done more for us! Lovely room and food, excellent choice at breakfast and wedding dinner, top class. Lovely gardens and plenty of parking too. A great stay. Thanks all.",5,2019,09,02
218,Girls Trip Stay Killashee House Hotel,Organised a spa day for myself and friends as a going away celebration. The hotel were very accommodating and allowed me leave balloons etc in the room prior to check in as a surprise. After a day at the spa we chose to stay in and used room service which I cannot fault. The room was spotless and very spacious. Beds were very comfortable and all staff were very helpful and kind during our stay. Will definitely return again,5,2019,09,02
218,RLOK,"Stayed here with two of my friends it was a lovely place to meet up. The room was very comfortable and quite.
The food in the Bistro restaurant was okay and it was part of our package.
The breakfast the next morning was really good great choice and good service.
I left something behind in the room and dispite many phone calls the hotel has not been able to locate it! ",4,2019,08,30
218,Beautiful Exterior and Interior,"Beautiful gardens and interior. Staff really friendly. They even arranged for a Birthday Brownie to be send to our room as I had happened to mention that our stay was a birthday treat for my niece. Lovely place for relaxing break. Only sorry that we couldn't stay longer . Looking forward to going back.
",4,2019,08,30
218,Wonderful Stay,"This is an excellent Hotel - I unreservedly recommend it. Warm and welcoming atmosphere at all times.
Impeccable cleanliness and order. Lovely comfortable rooms; excellent food. A really enjoyable and relaxing stay.",5,2019,08,30
218,Relaxing stay,"We had a two night stay at this beautiful hotel.I would highly recommend dining in the Bistro,the three course menu as part of the two night stay package was excellent value.The breakfast ,in the Turner room was also excellent,the eggs Royale were beautifully cooked,they were the best I have ever tasted.The room was very comfortable, it was missing a kettle and had only one cup on check in  but a helpful chambermaid from  the hallway quickly got it with a few cups as well.My mother ,who has mobility issues,using a walker found the room and bathroom easy to navigate but did find it was a bit of a trek from the Reception area to the room but overall really enjoyed her stay as the staff were all very friendly and attentive, the food delicious and she enjoyed going out to the Butterfly garden which had step free access . We would definitely make a return visit.",5,2019,08,30
218,Killashee - Excellent on so many levels,"Beautiful hotel, grounds and gardens. Delicious food, evening dinner in the Bistro in particular. Amazing staff throughout, housekeeping, waiting, bar, front of house, leisure center, genuinely friendly, informative and helpful across the board.",5,2019,08,29
218,Nice...,Lovely hotel fab gardens to walk...rooms a bit hot and food was not very good...could be just a bad day when I ate there but my experience was not good with the food..other than the food lively hotel to stay in.,4,2019,08,28
218,Hotel is old outdated and overpriced,"Nothing there is worth a penny,  lovely gardens but thats note reason enough to charge 200 EURO a NIGHT! The rooms are old everything inside is old and crunky... food is just avarage.
I would not recommend to anyone to spend their money there, there are much nicer and cosy hotels",1,2019,08,28
218,very enjoyable,The room was very large and comfortable. The breakfast was good and had a variety of foods. I felt the service was excellent. Everybody was super friendly. The drinks were a little expensive but I think that's standard when it comes to hotels.,4,2019,08,28
218,Killashee hotel,"Would recommend to anyone for a breakaway staff were very accommodating the spa, restaurant and room were lovely. The gardens were very well kept and were very tranquil to walk around. Breakfast in the morning in the turners room was lovely.",5,2019,08,28
218,Stunning hotel,Fabulous hotel would highly recommend. Very family friendly especially for young children as there is a outdoor play area and an indoor play room. Staff are a credit to the hotel as they are very welcoming and friendly. Will stay again.,5,2019,08,27
218,Charming Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights for our honeymoon. On first seeing the hotel from the drive up, it was just stunning.. inside was just as good, with a large reception/seating area and sweeping staircase. Check in was very quick and on arrival at room we were greeted with 2 mini bottles of sparkling wine and mini desserts. Gorgeous, spacious room in the Belling wing which is quite a walk from reception, but it kept us fit 😁 
Food was delightful, so we ate here both nights. Bistro quite noisy due to it being very large and open but this didn’t put us off much. Breakfast lovely too..Staff were courteous and helpful, no complaints at all really. 
Grounds are a treat to walk round or you can hop on a bicycle from the front door. 
Will definitely return as it really is a gorgeous, breathtaking hotel inside and out. ",5,2019,08,27
218,Not a good experience,"The website looks A LOT better than the actual hotel. The staff is friendly but extremeley disorganised. Food in the “fine dining” restaurant was cery poor, I was served tortelini that I’m convinced came straight from a discount supermarket. No flavour, and undercooked.
The bistro’s service was messy and confused, staff seemed to spend more time speakijg with each other than with guests. 
The room was nice, however, the music from the gym was disruptive most of the day, blasting across the yard. 
All in all; do not recommend. ",1,2019,08,27
218,Beautiful hotel,"Amazing grounds, playground for the kids, leisure centre, spacious rooms great place lots to do,very well kept and run,really enjoyed our stay here,not far from naas town,lots of shops and places to eat,enjoyed our stay ",5,2019,08,27
218,Lovely for a wedding,"There were two weddings on so the hotel was very busy. The staff were really friendly and the gardens were beautiful. The only downfall was that the room was not clean, with clumps of hair on the carpet that had clearly not been hoovered and the ridiculous number of spiders and spider webs around the window",3,2019,08,27
218,Nice location but poorly run down since visited last year,"The service was slow. Absent minded with simple tea , coffee orders. Mix up at reception. Staff mixed up payment. Rooms clean but no air con . Very stuffy. Restaurant was closed , everyone was packed into the bar and the noise was terrible. Would not be in a hurry back coming from a frequent visitor . ",3,2019,08,25
218,Highly recommend,"Went away to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary go Kilashee Hotel. If was a highly enjoyable experience all round from the service, the room and the tasty food. 
The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, and your very near so many great tourist attractions",5,2019,08,25
218,Short stay,"Can’t recommend it enough. It’s old and modern, service and food were excellent. The room I stayed in was spacious and spotless, the Leisure Centre and Gym are well equipped. Just the perfect stay....",5,2019,08,25
218,Luxury in a beautiful setting,"We had a fabulous time and that nothing could have been better in terms of accommodation, food and general levels of customer service. We ate lunch and dinner in the bistro (both of which were delicious) and thoroughly enjoyed breakfast and afternoon tea also. The suite was amazing and our daughter really enjoyed the kids club. All staff were friendly and helpful and we could not have asked for more. We had a lovely walk in the beautiful grounds and also enjoyed the fabulous pool and leisure facilities. We thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay and would have no hesitation recommending this hotel!",5,2019,08,24
218,Family get together,Spent two nights here recently The hotel is in a beautiful setting surrounded by beautiful gardens. The staff were very professional and friendly. The rooms are a little dated but were large clean and had everything you need. A large bottle of water was provided in the room which was a nice touch. We were there midweek the main dining room turners only opens on the weekend. so the bistro was the only dining option. The menu was not very extensive so we just ate there one night. We ordered steak which was lovely but we were waiting 40 minutes for it. The breakfast was the usual buffet style with fruit yogurts pastries. The hot food was serve yourself and looked like it had been in the warmer for some time. Its a lovely hotel and in a lovely setting but the food variety and the breakfast let it down. ,4,2019,08,23
218,Fantastic luxurious hotel experience only a short hop from Dublin Airport,"This hotel is so beautiful, with a beautiful manor house and sprawling gardens. The rooms are spacious and the beds are so comfortable. The staff are amazing and the amenities such as the leisure centre and spa are world class. We were booked in for a family wedding, which was hands down the best wedding we ever attended. The breakfast was fantastic and everyone was so welcoming. We can't wait to return to Killashee.",5,2019,08,20
218,Disappointing.,"Internal layout is piecemeal and entirely disconnected with outdoors. Long walks and stairs to bedrooms seem unavoidable. Very few spaces with natural light. 

Breakfasts were good and wedding dining was ok. There is no comfort in the bar. Stool sitting. 
",1,2019,08,20
218,Girls night away,"Perfect for a night away with friends. Lots of spaces to sit, relax and talk. Food was really good in the bistro. Probably the best swimming pool in any hotel I've stayed in, if you want to do a few lengths... spotless too. I would have no hesitation recommending Killahee Hotel!!",5,2019,08,19
218,Lovely Relaxed and Friendly,"Stayed one night with family. 
Room was very nice and hotel was lovely and had a very nice quiet feel to it. Enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea and really enjoyed the little savory snacks and the sweet treat and scones were delicious.
That night we enjoyed a very nice meal and service was perfect. 
Enjoyed a nice breakfast and there was a huge amount to choose from and I found it all to be of good quality and taste.
Enjoyed 2 spa treatments and the staff there were particularly friendly and professional. 
I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.",4,2019,08,19
218,Alternative to staying in Dublin for the ferry home,Imposing hotel. Lovely room and massive bathroom. Free parking ( not available at many of the hotels we stayed at) . We were miles away from the restaurant involving 2 lifts and lots of corridors but that was not a problem. General restaurant was noisy with lots of kids and 2 TV screens (no sound). Food good.But a better option for us than staying in Dublin.,5,2019,08,19
218,Lovely spa break,"We booked a 2 night weekend spa break and had a lovely time. The room was a good size and very comfortable for 3 people (even if the window didn’t open enough to cool it in summer). The hotel generally was very nicely decorated. We spent an afternoon in the spa and it was lovely, down to the toiletries available and the sorbet in the relaxation room. For reference, the spa is easy to reach - a short walk through the hotel and then a few meters across the car park.

We also had dinner in Turner’s Restaurant and really enjoyed it - food was tasty with some nice twists. Special mention to the manager Margaret who was excellent. We finished off with cocktails in the bar which were lovely. Only comment is the lights could have been dimmed a bit for more of an evening vibe. Gardens were also lovely for a stroll, and the whole thing was great value. Highly recommended!",5,2019,08,18
218,Gorgeous hotel,Great value for a luxury accommodation. highly recommend.. food was lovely really enjoy the breakfast and the setting was fabulous! So close to Dublin. We have a twin room with two huge beds. So happy with the choice  ,5,2019,08,16
218,Relaxing stay,"Had afternoon tea followed by treatments in the spa. Staff, location and hotel all helped make the stay worthwhile.

Junior suite was spacious and the jacuzzi bath was welcome after a long day. Breakfast options were plentiful and tasty.",4,2019,08,15
218,Family break away,"Wonderful Hotel for a family break away, kids loved the gardens and playground. Great spa and leisure centre for the rainy days. Hotel food is wonderful, great selection especially at breakfast. Great destination for visiting kildare village, Japanese gardens and National stud. Wonderful hotel also for a romantic break away. The gardens are just superior.   ",5,2019,08,15
218,A lovely one night break,A lovely stay at a Beautiful location.  Cocktails and food were very good.  Trip to room was a little confusing but to be expected in old buildings.  Staff were helpful and allowed us check in early.  Take a bike ride if the on site bikes are free.  The gardens are stunning.,5,2019,08,14
218,"Lovely stay, good value","Really enjoyed the stay. Hotel was lovely, breakfast had great options, staff very friendly all round! Enjoyed the hydrotherapy pool followed by a relaxing spa treatment and then chilled in the relaxation suite for an hour or so :)",4,2019,08,14
218,Kindness at historic hotel,"I had a 'Shop and Stay' visit with my Mum, which included dinner, b and b and lovely discount vouchers for Kildare Village and Newbridge Silverware. Our twin room was very spacious, comfortable and well equipped, The hotel and grounds are really lovely. When my Mum was unwell overnight and we needed to extend checkout and needed service to room, the staff were incredibly kind and thoughtful. This service was extremely thoughtful. 

The delay gave me a chance to explore the beautiful grounds. This is a gem of a hotel, well worth the visit. A beautiful breakfast was also provided, with good coffee? 

Well worth the visit.",5,2019,08,12
218,Nice friendly staff,"Stayed here two nights, room was very spacious and quiet. Bathroom could do with an upgrade, grouting was discoloured in places. Bed was very comfortable but already the plain beige carpet had a few stains on it, bad colour choice for a hotel.
Having booked a room for 3 adults there was only 2 of the essentials provided, but a phone call to reception and it was quickly sorted
The service was very professional and the food was delicious. The grounds are stunning especially when the sun is shining.
The layout of the bedroom area is very strange, we had to go up to the 3rd floor in the lift, walk down a corridor and take another lift to the 2nd floor. Got lost a couple of times.",4,2019,08,10
218,Noisy and unkempt,"My room overlooked the car park opposite the gym. The noise from the gym was horrendous. Loud music non stop. I asked to move rooms but no one got back to me. The curtains were ripped, the shower stank of mildew and the last persons rubbish was still in the bin. The restaurant was very overpriced for average food. I had a curry and the naan was cold. Straight out of a packet without being cooked. The hotel looks posh,  but believe me, it’s not! Not the relaxing stay I was hoping for. ",1,2019,08,10
218,Lovely hotel in beautiful surroundings.,There are very few places in this area serving food all day so we were very pleased to find the Killashee Hotel. I reserved a table in the Bistro by e-mail and received a response immediately - plus a follow up reminder the day of our trip. The hotel is very large and set in a beautiful grounds.   Excellent and extensive disabled parking just by reception. The bistro' is large and extremely comfortable and a table had been reserved for us in an area beside the window as we'd requested. Otherwise there is no other natural light. This is quality Bistro' style with very comfortable seating. The menu is not extensive but adequate and food quality is upmarket but not overpriced. I had a look around the ground floor - the restaurant overlooks the gardens and there is also a lovely conservatory plus outside seating. Staff was friendly and efficient.   All in all a lovely venue.,5,2019,08,08
218,Could be better,"Excellent location, lovely grounds. Rooms and bathroom are large and spacious but a bit tired. If your room is located near any of the function rooms then you could be kept awake till the early hours by the noise. 
Breakfast was disappointing especially on our first morning in the bistro which had limited cereals and juices and not very helpful staff 
We felt if staying for a few days and eating in the bistro each night it was a limited menu with not many specials of the day .
On the whole the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay , but we felt it was overpriced for what we experienced. I don’t think we would return unless some issues were resolved",3,2019,08,07
218,Large family gathering of 36 people including 5 children under 12 to celebrate Golden Wedding Anniversary.,"This celebration was organised by my eldest daughter to celebrate our Golden Wedding which occurred in that week. All siblings of both my wife and I ,who could attend were invited along with our own children and their families. We were given a private room and the meal was served at 2pm on a Saturday. We had to leave the room around 6pm. The food was very good and the atmosphere brilliant. A great occasion.",5,2019,08,07
218,"Lovely friendly staff, can't do enough for you","The staff from start to finish were beyond lovely. We couldn't get over it. The spa was really lovely, the hydro pool was a particular highlight. The main bar is lovely and they offer live music at the weekends. ",4,2019,08,07
218,Awful experience,"I booked junior suite with jacuzzi for very special occasion on bank holiday weekend.Check in was at 3.00 we where left in waiting area for hour and 20 minutes. Girl at the desk offered us coffee which we never got served while we where waiting. Once we could check in I asked for late check out we where given half an hour after we waited for more than hour.The biggest disappointment was when we got to room. Room was smelling of bleach that bad so eyes was watering, bathroom was filthy. Jacuzzi  is just a bath size for kids.Anyway we end up not staying ,I got full refund, but our weekend and special night was ruined .such a let down and awful experience.",1,2019,08,06
218,Wedding,"Could not fault anything. Hotel, staff, food, rooms all brilliant.
I would highly recommend this hotel for a wedding or a special birthday also would be lovely for a week-end break.  Very near Newbridge Silverwear  and Kildare Shopping Outlet.",5,2019,08,05
218,"Beautiful Hotel, stunning grounds & lovely staff","My husband, myself and our 19 month old stayed at Killashee for two nights and we really enjoyed our stay. The rooms are spacious and inviting. The travel cot t and sheets provided for our little one were spotless. The grounds surrounding the hotel are just beautiful, with a lovely butterfly garden, park and walks. The food in the restaurant was just yummy and so child friendly, providing crayons and paper and serving out little one first. The leisure center was nice too, definitely a place to stay with young children for a couple of days. Thank you to all a Killashee for a lovely stay. ",5,2019,08,04
218,Excellent experience,A beautiful building wonderfully kept. Genuine experience in a classic environment. Luxurious room. Peaceful environment. Efficient staff. Wide variety for breakfast. Beautifully kept gardens..it was a wonderful experience overall. Highly recommend. ,5,2019,08,04
218,Corporate Stay,"Corporate stay due to work in the area, normally never use this hotel as I have others which I prefer, however, with the time of year the Killashee was the only one with availability.

Check in was simple, staff are polite and I can't fault this part at all.

Room was a fair walk from reception, it involves a long walk and 2 uses of a lift.  This doesn't bother me personally but it may bother some.  The room was large, clean and bright.  I can't fault anything with the room at all.

Dinning was a poor experience, the room is a large open floor plan with tables everywhere, there's no theme here, it's just like a big mess hall.  Took some seats and gave room number for opening a tab, waiter then returned wanting the details again and name this time, no problem but this is 4 star hotel and I would expect the staff to be a bit more attentive.
The menu is poor and overpriced, it's overpriced because the standard of food is extremely poor.  I did not enjoy my dining experience at all.

Breakfast was very good, nice dining room, well laid out and a large buffet style breakfast awaits.

I've avoided this hotel for years but with no availability at my regular hotels I gave the Killashee a try, it will the last time I will stay here, it's just not for me.",2,2019,08,04
218,"poor, would not return","Room was very dated and worn, not the cleanest. Carpet and kettle were filthy. Very far away from reception. Had to take a lift, then walk across a huge lounge and then get another lift. Dinner was fine, desserts were terrible. Very average breakfast. When i stayed about 10 years ago, things were much better. Would not return and would not recommend to friends.",2,2019,08,02
218,Not like in the photos,"We should have realised that Killashee hotel is a basic hotel due to the price, but the photographs made hotel seem so beautiful that we thought it is something special. The reception is in the beautiful main building but the rooms are in a separate building which is built maybe in the 80’s? We had the so called superior room which should be better than the basic one, but it was bit boring and very plain. The garden was beautiful but the hotels backyard looked like a warehouse.
In the main building there are beautiful interiors for having a party but the hotel quests dont get to enjoy any of them.

The staff didnt do anything wrong, this feedback is for the management. It would be fair to get the real idea of the hotel and not be fooled with the glamorous images. All the brochures and advertising is well done, but leads ashore.

The ladies in the spa and leisure centre were super nice and cool! Also people in the reception and bistro were very friendly.",3,2019,08,01
218,Great Hotel - highly recommended ,I must give this hotel a review as I have visited it now over ten times on business and each and every time the service I receive is impeccable. It is a wonderful location and the building is grand with beautiful furnishings and gardens.. without exception the staff are all wonderful in every department. The menu is good and reasonably priced and the bar is well stocked.. I would highly recommend this lovely hotel..,5,2019,08,01
218,Birthday weekend ,"Stayed here for the weekend of my partner’s birthday and splashed out a bit extra to get the quality and that this hotel appeared to exude. Was pleased without being blown away. The suite that we had was an absolute route march away from the core of the hotel but was quiet and reasonably tidy. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, the bathroom decent but the room just getting tired. The bar was fine, if a little pricey, the breakfasts were first class. I heard that a refurbishment is planned and that can only be good news. Would stay again unless the prices rose.  ",4,2019,07,29
218,Spa Escape ,"Our group of 6 had an amazing visit to Killashee House Hotel to enjoy an overnight stay including dinner, breakfast and 2 spa treatments. We all enjoyed the treatments and use of the hydrotherapy pool. After checking into our triple rooms we headed to the Bistro for very tasty food from a set menu. There was plenty to choose from and we chose pâté and salmon to start and for mains we had homemade burger, curry, Dahl and hake. Desserts were pavlova, chocolate tart, ice creams, creme brûlée finished off with decent cups of coffee. Waiting staff were great and very attentive. Breakfast was a mixture of buffet and some a la carte items. All good. Some homemade breads would have been perfect though staff did find some brown bread when we asked. 
The history of this hotel is interesting and it has been very well converted into a hotel while still keeping the ambiance. It was great value at €169 per person. ",5,2019,07,29
218,Wedding visit,"Stayed here for a recent wedding. General impression of the hotel is fantastic, the building and grounds looked great. We had to check in early to make the ceremony on time and this was facilitated by the reception staff as we had contacted beforehand. My room was nice, exactly what you would expect in an old house hotel ie: old style mahogany furniture. The setting and the hotel grounds added to the entire wedding experience. The food at the function was excellent and the staff both young and old were really friendly, so much so they were all full of chat when we met them again the next evening for day 2 of the celebration :-) I had never heard of Killashee house before attending this wedding but it left a very good impression. Did not have any bar food or use the spa and leisure center so cannot comment on those.",4,2019,07,29
218,Family stay,Amazing family fun stay! Will definitely be returning. My 4 year old enjoyed the pool and the kids club. Loved it! We used bikes to explore the grounds and my son was delighted to find rabbits and squirrels real nice place for young children!,5,2019,07,27
218,Family Break,"We had a wonderful family break in Killashee where the staff were lovely and super helpful, the food was good and there was lots of room for kids to roam around. The gardens were fantastic, although the butterfly trail was a little in need of some attention. 
The playground was great too and we really enjoyed the pool too.
My only other negative was that although on a family package we did not get a family room as was advertised and had a double bed for 2 children even though I requested twin beds for them.",4,2019,07,25
218,High price for low value,"Stayed for two nights with my wife and 6yr old daughter.
Moved room as too close to extractor fans and sharing corridor with teenage students from the US who were friendly but noisy.
Couldn’t sleep due to the heat in bedroom as no aircon.
Food was very expensive, €17.50 for fish and chips, €16.50 for a burger.
€33 for a chicken wrap, a sandwich, plate of chips and a pot of tea. Half hour wait for coffees; waiter forgot! Shouldn’t happen in a four star hotel. 
We didn’t finish either, my chicken didn’t taste great and I ended up going to the nearest Pharmacy with an upset tummy. A glass of wine costs €7.20!!
The hotel looks jaded and needs a makeover. Carpets in the corridors are stained and smell musty.
My daughter enjoyed the pool apart from numerous plasters and other bits and bobs floating in both pools! There was a strong smell of pee in the family changing room.
The grounds are beautiful and well maintained.
The staff were friendly and helpful, however I wouldn’t stay there again as the prices are high and food below par. A couple we met booked out after one night for this very reason.",3,2019,07,24
218,Happy family day,Happy day  at my nephews wedding with my family from around the world Some of whom I had not seen for a number of years .It was great to spend time with them at killashee house in beautiful surroundings beautiful food and friendly staff ,5,2019,07,24
218,Over night stay,Really enjoyed my stay at the Killashee. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food was beautiful and the hotel and in particular the gardens are fabulous. I would highly recommend a stay here. ,5,2019,07,23
218,Great hotel,"Stayed two days in this hotel, friendly and helpful staff, good food in bistro and breakfast and lovely walks in gardens (weather permitting!). Paid additional €10 each  to use spa infinity pool area, we felt it was worth it. At check in, without us asking, we were given a free room upgrade which was very much appreciated. Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2019,07,22
218,Perfect,"Our stay was lovely, we really enjoyed the hotel. Location was great, grounds were fabulous, couldn't get enough of the food and drinks. Staff couldn't do more for us, super friendly. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2019,07,22
218,Family at Killashee,"Very clean, staff excellent. Family orientated which is great. Great location. Playground and pool were enjoyed by all the family. Food very good in bar, breakfasts have plenty of choice. All in all a very pleasant stay.",5,2019,07,21
218,"Lovely hotel ,shame about the Leisure centre!","Our experience of this hotel was very positive until we walked over to the leisure centre for  some exercise and a swim. To say that the whole place could do with a good deep cleaning would be an understatement. We saw a pile of filthy towels in an area of the gym which, thankfully, was cordoned off. Toilets were smelly, bins overflowing and the whole area of gym, pool and changing rooms had just a general air of dirt and neglect.
Why the management of an otherwise super facility allows such low standards in such a key area is difficult to comprehend.",2,2019,07,18
218,Disappointing Rooms!,"My 9 year old daughter and I stayed in room 310, a twin room, for two nights. I was so disappointed with the room if the hotel photos had been a true reflection of the condition of the room I would not have booked, it certainly didn’t have a luxurious feel to it. The room was very tired and felt grubby due to numerous areas of chipped enamel in the bath, stains on carpets and curtains, bad plastering on walls (unfinished plastering outside the window) and the furniture has seen better days, no mini fridges in room either to keep water cold in what was a very humid and uncomfortably hot room due to lack of aircon in warm weather and a window that doesn’t open far enough to get a good breeze in (health & safety reasons obviously hence the need for aircon!) and to that point that window doesn’t close properly either. One of the receptionists, an older lady with glasses, was abrupt and sharp in manner when I went down late that first night to ask where I could get extra water also mentioning lack of aircon was unfortunate as we couldn’t get to sleep. A refresher course in common courtesy wouldn’t go a miss. Thankfully a different lovely receptionist accommodated us with a small fan for our room the next day. Overall disappointed with myself for choosing this hotel over the other one I was considering.",3,2019,07,18
218,Great weekend sleep,Smart and comfortable beautiful gardens great leisure club and the staff couldn’t have been nicer plenty of staff and nothing was too much bother upgrades to a suite which was the size of my downstairs plenty of room and a great three nights sleep even with numerous weddings going one the hotel didn’t seem crowded,5,2019,07,17
218,Very disappointed,"We had been given a complimentary stay within the hotel & it was just disappointing - there’s an older lady at reception with glasses that I found unhelpful & quite rude. The times for kids club were incorrect on the board in main reception & when you have two small kids with zero concept of time an hour is a long time to wait.
We booked an afternoon tea and because we had kids with us we asked could we move our afternoon tea to an outside area as not to disturb others. Well Jeepers this seemed to cause major issues and our server needed to go and confirm with managers if this was ok?? Which took about 15mins. Just ridiculous. Food is average & very over priced. We had to constantly go looking for staff - most of them are very young and really don’t look like they want to be there. 
Breakfast was kinda depressing really all a bit slap dash, nothing enticing - it was all just disappointing.
The hotel itself & it’s surroundings inclusive of the gardens is stunning it has so much to offer and it’s such a shame it’s staff are lacking the attention to detail and standards that guests come for, it seems to be more of a place that caters for ‘conference room’ bookers really & companies holding training days.

218,Absolutely perfect,"What a wonderful experience, absolutely perfect.  

Staff are so friendly and pleasant, a great credit to this hotel.

Thank you for a beautiful, spacious room, room 323 family room, it was so beautiful and spacious.

Thank you for the wonderful birthday gesture to our friend, the birthday plate was very much appreciated.

Spa facilities just perfect.

Breakfast delicious and again all staff were amazing.

The highlight of our stay was the bikes available for guest use, complimentary.  We loved this experience, we enjoyed a cycle into Naas and along the canal path.  This truly is a special experience, a wonderful addition to any stay.  Well done on providing this facility, I truly believe other hotels should take note, at this fantastic idea.   It really works and definitely brought so much additional fun to our stay. 

Well done to all at Killashee.  Everything was perfect for us on our visit and I cannot wait to return. ",5,2019,07,15
218,Beautiful Hotel - Rooms a bit of a walk and busy breakfast with wedding guests but would visit again,Room location a bit confusing & dispersed if mobility issues mention with your booking & try & gt room close to reception. A big wedding hotel so breakfast was very busy  & a bit manic on the Sat & sun mornings,4,2019,07,15
218,Amateur hour,"It had been over 10 years since I stayed in Killashee Hotel as I have been living abroad and I was left wondering what has happened to this once great hotel! From the minute we checked in it felt like a bunch of uninformed staff who had very little idea what they were doing were running the hotel .At check in it felt like chaos,there was a wedding arriving so lots of people checking in but it was 3.45pm and it was obvious that alot of rooms were not ready.We were informed that our room was not ready but then told it was an error and that the room was actually ready which was fine.I asked about the kids club in the evening (which was one of the main reasons we booked this hotel) and was told it commenced at 6pm but when my husband asked another lady if we needed to book our son in she said there was no kids club that evening as it was Friday night and they do not offer kids club on weekends unless there are alot of children in the hotel??Surely weekends are prime time for family travel and we saw alot of children during our stay.....I checked with another member of the reception team who again said yes kids club opened at 6pm so we went and checked out the playground  and then got ready to go to the bistro for an early dinner so our son could attend kids club......Again the experience in the bistro was amateur at best .I ordered a bottle of  white wine which arrived at our table after around 15 minutes as it could not be found and had to be retrieved from a store room somewhere in the building,the bartender then brought it to our table unchilled so eventually we ordered a different wine.There were alot of staff who all looked lost and were just wandering around the restaurant and there were 3 managers ,two of whom looked equally lost and were just wondering around while the bartenders were openly eating potato chips behind the bar!! The one saving grace of this whole experience was that the food was great but everything else just felt amateur and  unprofessional.We stayed in a family room on the ground floor and the room felt tired and it serious need of an upgrade,especially the bathroom.....and as it turned out.......NO KIDS CLUB!! I do not know if Killashee has changed ownership since my last stay but this once great hotel is great no more which is such a shame as the building and gardens are so visually stunning.",3,2019,07,14
218,A Hidden Gem!!,"My family and I have just returned from an over night stay at what I can only describe this hotel as being splendid!!! 
I didn’t know what to expect as I had never heard of this hotel before.....Well what a wonderful surprise we got!
The rooms are spotless, food is mouth watering, fabulous leisure facilities and breath taking gardens! 
Honestly I’ve been to lots of hotels all over the world from 7stars to 3stars and this hotel is now one of my top 3!!
A special mention to Dallon in the breakfast room who was very attentive and went over and beyond to see to our table and that we had everything we needed. 

My only regret is not known or hearing about this hotel before now!! 

We can’t wait to return again very soon....
Thank you for making it a memorable one!!

218,excellent stay,"Beautiful hotel ,excellent staff could not do enough for you , food was very good ,rooms where spotless and very comfortable with extra large beds,the grounds where great for a leisurely stroll ,great swimming available to all guests ",5,2019,07,14
218,Excellent,Five Stars. Very peaceful. Beautiful grounds. Superior hotel in great location close to town centre and motorway. Just a vet special place and far superior to most other hotels in Ireland. I have been there many times as my brother and his family live close by! It is our family hotel when we visit.,5,2019,07,12
218,Great place near Naas,"We have a lovely family gathering in this hotel with dinner and bed & breakfast.
Lovely swimming pool and leisure centre, great garden walks along with a children playground.
Rooms were very good other than they were very warm at this time of year.
Had a lovely family dinner , menu good, service good.
Breakfast was a little off , buffet food long time around and staff all over the place a little more training need.
But a great place to visit.",5,2019,07,10
218,Fantastic Stay in everyway!!,Beautiful hotel and grounds! Very friendly staff offering a fantastic service to us. The rooms were in a superb condition and I had the cosiest sleep! Both dinner and breakfast in the Bistro was delicious :) ,5,2019,07,10
218,Not the Same,"Use to love this Hotel but hit and miss at some points stayed for forever young festival.
Stayed in a nice Suite jacuzzi bath did not work told reception did nothing if you pay for a suite every thing should work.Very Noisy Sat night dont mind a bit after all were out to enjoy our selves but out of control nothing done by reception.
Bar in main build cold not cosy
Need the Nuns kitchen back.
The hotel is a nice old building and grounds but it is missing that touch
Pity this place use to be gold spent a lot of good times there.",3,2019,07,08
218,"4 night stay, lovely gardens, bit hit and miss, over priced.","Reception not that obvious when you drive up the avenue - needs better signage. Depending on where your room is located can dictate where to park. Large hotel, lot of walking.. Slightly complicated walking routes using elevators. One guest had written “maze” in the elevator and I could see why. Bistro menu was average fare, drinks expensive eg Gin & tonic (€5.50-8.50 + mixer €2.20).  Good WiFi. Tea & coffee in room, complimentary water. Staff were good but inconsistent, one morning “breakfast to go” was a plain sandwich but the next day the breakfast bag contained yogurt (and a plastic spoon), water, apple, croissant and the sandwich (great!).  Rooms were very clean and quiet. Breakfast disappointing in that fruit was pre-chopped melon and pineapple but no whole local in season fruits like strawberries, apples, pears, etc. bread range minimal. No chia seeds, sunflower seeds, linseed or smoked salmon - a lot of sugary cereals - all smacked of trying to cut down on costs. When poached eggs were ordered served up on slice of white bread and not toast as customary. 3 egg omelette was large and very tasty.  Gardens were very nice, playground & children’s indoor playroom-good, but butterfly garden needs a bit of care and attention eg, weeding. Fine for overnight but not a longer stay. More a Conference and wedding venue.",4,2019,07,06
218,Relaxing break,"Lovely grounds for walk. Large bedrooms with 2 king size beds in each. Bathroom filled daily with toiletries. Good swimming pool. Restaurant excellent, staff great, a little overpriced.  Plenty of areas to sit and relax. Large hotel so you are going to have to walk folks.  Great breakfast day 1. Although 2nd day a conference was on. They had left the breakfast room  when we went for breakfast so had the staff!!- we were in allocated breakfast time. Eventually allocated a table that was not set up. Felt a little unwanted in room, not all food available. Two staff rushing to set up for lunch.  That really was the only blip.    I would stay again. ",4,2019,07,05
218,Lovely Hotel with interesting history,"We selected this hotel for its charm and convenience of driving to the airport the next day. Our overall experience here was very good. The hotel has an interesting history as a private residence, popular private school taught by nuns, and now hotel. There was going to be a wedding taking place the evening we were there but they were in a separate section of the hotel and we really didn't notice the activity. The bar area was very nice and was attached to the dining area. The only slight detraction from the visit was the wait staff in the pub restaurant. The host was a seasoned friendly individual but the majority of the wait staff were very young and seemed new/inexperienced/in training. Menu offerings were good. We had the ""special"" pork entree and it was done well with a tasty accompanying sauce, potatoes and vegetable. I took a walk back to the event area after dinner. There was a room set up for the nuptials and the ballroom area was set up beautifully for the wedding reception. Down the hall from the ballroom was a vintage pub where guests could also go after the wedding. The hotel bedroom was spacious and clean. The room temperature was chilly when we arrived but upon phoning the front desk to see how to adjust the heat, I was told that heat was by zones. She said she would ask that the heat in our zone be turned up. I thought we would probably have to adjust to being cold but within 10 minutes I could feel the warmth! Kudos! Breakfast offered a good selection set up buffet style plus you could order off a limited menu. The breakfast room was in the large dining room so there were plenty of available tables. The gardens were beautiful. Front desk staff were efficient and friendly. I would stay here again.",4,2019,07,04
218,Ireland Vacation,Great place to stay just outside of Dublin to catch up on your rest from a long oversees flight. Everything about the hotel is top notch. Give yourself time to walk the gardens and explore the hotels amenities.,5,2019,07,03
218,Great Hotel,"Would really recommend if you have not visited this hotel you should do so, from the beautiful setting, gardens to the staff who were outstanding.  the food was beautiful with plenty of choice. Will defiantly be back.",5,2019,07,01
218,Super hotel,We stayed here and it was a smashing hotel and well worth a visit to stay.  We got a voucher for the hotel so did not know it existed but after staying in it we will be back .  Lovely grounds and our suite was fantastic and really enjoyed the food  ,5,2019,06,30
218,A well run hotel in beautiful grounds,"Wonderful grounds and lovely rooms in ""new"" part of hotel. Food in Bistro functional and could benefit from more 'healthy' options. Staff very helpful and pleasant.A very large hotel (numbers of rooms) but did not feel busy/ crowded.",4,2019,06,29
218,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is very beautiful, the room was lovely, friendly staff, gorgeous grounds.   Just a wonderful experience. Highly recommend a stay here.  Very interesting history and great for relaxation and walking in the gardens.  ",5,2019,06,28
218,Over rated,"Nothing special about this hotel. Rooms neef revamped. Bathroom had brown disintegrated grout around sink and all large area missing grout and sealant at sink. Was also large chip in the bath. I won't be back. Check out staff totally disinterested no smiles or thank, seemed more interested on another task.",2,2019,06,28
218,Stunning,"Thank you to all at Killashee Hotel & leisure complex. I wanted something elegant and stylish yet affordable. This hotel has ticked all these boxes and delivered so much more. The drive in towards the hotel is a beautiful tree lined meander with the impressive, beautifully kept gardens either side. A lovely walk to the rear of the hotel filled the day with sounds of the birds singing and children playing in the park. I just happened to mention, a couple of days before our visit, that this was our 21st wedding anniversary and could we have an earlier check-in as we were travelling three hours to get here. Not only were we able to check-in earlier but we also received an upgrade to a suite and a welcoming chocolate mouse with the words piped in chocolate onto the dish 'Happy Anniversary'. Our experience with all the staff has been second to none with nothing ever too much trouble. If ever there was a way to guarantee our return this is how you do it. We will return, not looking for an upgrade, just for a repeat of the excellence of service as at times all we guests really want is to receive a smile and recognition that we had a choice of where to stay and chose your establishment. Thank you for everything.",5,2019,06,28
218,Day trip only,"Whilst the main house is beautiful from the outside and the grounds are lovely, accommodation is in dire need of an upgrade. I am not sure if there is any accommodation in the main house, but most rooms are in the added on areas. Upon entering the room it can best be described as standard and grubby. I felt I had to wear slippers on the carpet, as it was so stained I felt dirty. The room size was quite big but requires refurbishment. If you plan on staying here, you need to ask for a “better” room, if there are any, otherwise stay in Dublin, as it is quite far out of town and drive up for a visit, not to stay!",2,2019,06,26
218,A definite return,"Beautifully restored well presented and maintained historical hotel. We could not find fault with anything . We stayed so long after check out to see the gardens, relax with a cocktail on the terrace and feel the tranquility of the place. We stayed midweek and got great value for money. Breakfast was very good but we felt with a few more luxury touches it would have been excellent. Overall a gem. Children would have a ball a cute old world kiddies room for them to enjoy and the outdoor playground area is gorgeous, so next time we may (or may not) bring the kids! ",5,2019,06,25
218,Great wedding location,Attended a friends wedding here. It was fabulous from start to finish.  The grounds are fabulous for photographs. Bedroom was lovely. And breakfast was delicious. The meal at the reception was delicious and the room a perfect size. ,5,2019,06,24
218,Much better than expected.,"The hotel was beautiful. The gym facilities are the best I have seen at a hotel. Friendly staff and a great breakfast. 
Live music in the bar on the Friday evening was a nice surprise. 
Rooms were large and very clean. 
Highly recommend for business or couples. ",5,2019,06,24
218,Beautiful country house,"Stayed overnight at kilashee,looks beautiful as you drive up the driveway, beautiful gardens with beautiful walks,stayed in a suite in old part of building was big room, separate sitting room and roll top bath,had dinner in the bistro was lovely and service was good,only thing I didn't like would be nice if there was another little bar or lounge a bit cosier to have a drink found bistro  and bar area very open ,there is a smaller bar but only open it if very busy",5,2019,06,24
218,Doesn’t quite hit the mark,"Stayed here for a family wedding.  Booked two rooms months ago when wedding was announced.  Turns out one of the rooms was disabled access so my guest could not use the shower at all as it was preset too low over a rusting shower chair.  That room was also very dusty.  My room smelled very badly of damp.  
On checking out when I complained I was eventually told that they couldn’t guarantee rooms as so many were booked in.  I kindly reminded them that one should be told up front that you are being moved to a room where you won’t be able to shower!
Eventually the kind lady at the desk gave me €50 off the bill for the two rooms.  This breaks down to €20 off my damp room, and €30 off the other room without a shower.  That’s what we, as two paying customers meant to the hotel.  Wow, incredible customer loyalty.
Beds were comfortable and staff were wonderful but I won’t be back, and I certainly would not recommend.",3,2019,06,24
218,Spa hotel visit that sent me home tired and upset.,"Stayed one night.l on business trip with husband. Got little or no sleep due to workmen outside in the car park sawing, drilling and talking from evening until about 7.30am. I should have phoned reception but husband was able to sleep so I felt silly and didn’t want to disturb his sleep. I am a light sleeper and closed the window even though it was warm but the noise just kept on all night.  The next morning checking out I voiced my disappointment to reception who said they knew nothing about the work being done on the spa building which is part of their hotel. (How can a hotel decide to have work done while people are sleeping?)  The reception managers at the desk were informed but they avoided eye contact and conversation with me and explained the situation to the poor receptionist and left her to apologise and offer a little discount. They did not seem happy I had taken photos to prove I was not making it up and only this urged them to make this financial gesture. It was not about the money - it was sleep I wanted! I was being fobbed off so as not to draw attention to the issue in front of other customers. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Laughably the hotel has signs in the corridors telling guests not to disturb other sleeping guests! 
Otherwise the hotel is charming, the staff are helpful (not so much the reception managers though!) and the room was clean and comfortable. The grounds are lovely. The food was mostly good. For the high price charged, I expect much more and certainly to be treated with some respect by those who manage. I don’t generally write reviews but the superior attitude displayed upset me.",3,2019,06,23
218,Disappointing,"First of all, it is nothing like it shows on the pictures.  It is so outdated.  There is just rooms of random here and there spread out and run down.  Stains on the carpets.  Old furniture.  The lights in the bar, where you sit down to eat, are so bright it would remind you of a community centre bingo night and especially as the tables are lined out in rows.  To get to our room we had to get a lift up to higher level, walk all across another section to get a lift to bring us down to another level.  The room was clean but very outdated.  The pool was way out the back in a different building and it wasn't near so does not suit people staying in hotel really.  Again it also looked like a community centre.  The restaurant does not open on a sunday to which I was not informed on when I was booking.  BUT The reception staff were very helpful.  AND the waiting staff in the bar were so friendly and accommodating in every way.  Wonderful waiting staff in the bar for sure.  Overall, very disappointing for the cost of it.  Would not recommend this.",2,2019,06,19
218,Overpriced,"The communal areas of this hotel are beautiful, very impressive. I stayed for a wedding and it looked very well. The room however was €170 - extremely overpriced. For that rate I would expect a beautiful room but instead it took a very long walk and two lifts to get to our room, the decor in the room was old (80's style, not period style), the TV was placed very low in a cabinet. The soup we got at our meal was quite watery also. I wouldn't return for that price.",2,2019,06,18
218,Beautiful hotel,We stayed at kilashee recently for a wedding. The venue & grounds are beautiful. The food was top quality & the staff were attentive & friendly. The bedrooms/bathrooms are lovely. There was lots of choice at Breakfast & everything tasted good. I would definatly recommend kilashee & hope to visit again in the future. ,5,2019,06,16
218,Honeymoon stay,We stayed in the kilashee for three nights before going abroad on honeymoon. The hotel is very beautiful and comfortable. The bar food menu was slightly limited for someone who doesn't eat meat. Our best experience was attending the spa for a treatment and then going to the hydrotherapy pool. The atmosphere and the staff of the spa make the experience feel very luxurious.,4,2019,06,15
218,Very nice practical hotel for solo or family,"All round a very good hotel 
Friendly staff and a good atmosphere. The location is very appropriate for visiting Dublin city, Counties Wicklow Kildare and Meath  I did not use the spa other Gymnasium, but There is a nice garden. ",4,2019,06,12
218,Great place to relax,"Originally a convent so not the optimum in hotel design. There is a lot of walking to and from the bedrooms from the bar, reception and restaurant areas which are in different locations in the site. We had a great conference here and the whole experience was very good.",4,2019,06,12
218,Expert service,"Was at a wedding in Killashee - hotel staff could not have done more to help - superb service ( have visited several times and not come across a member of staff having on 'off' day, accommodation was great, food delicious and breakfast very good. Had opportunity to wander the grounds which are lovely on a summer day - Bistro can be a bit noisy when busy and that whole area could do with a re-design but that's the only downside!",5,2019,06,11
218,A relaxing & wonderful hotel,"Killashee hotel is a beautiful place to stay, the grounds are amazing to walk around, the staff are frreindly. The food is perfect. It's a lovely hotel to stay for a romantic break or a long stay or wedding ",5,2019,06,11
218,Beautiful Wedding,"We recently enjoyed four memorable days attending the wedding of our niece at The Killashee Hotel, Naas, Co. Kildare.   This beautiful venue is located at the end of a long and elegant driveway.  Once you make it to the front door you are in awe of all the beauty surrounding you.  It looks like a castle!  And for this group arriving from Miami that was awesome!   The hotel grounds are lovely and include a butterfly garden and a children’s playground.  The check in at the Reception Desk was easy and we felt welcomed and happy to be at the Killashee Hotel.   Once we had our keys we were given instructions on how to find our rooms.   The Killashee are various buildings put together and it is a bit of a maze.   This means we were to take a couple of elevators to reach our rooms.  No problem.   It just adds to the charm of the hotel and as long as you follow the signs posted on the elevators you will be fine.   Our rooms were big and comfortable with period furnishings and very clean.

Our family wedding was the experience of a lifetime and lots of fun. Family and friends from the USA and Ireland gathering to celebrate a marriage and enjoying every aspect of the day i.e.,  the church ceremony, cocktail hour,  the reception, speeches, and dancing.  And plenty of fun at the Snug Traditional Irish Pub!  This is quite the place!  Perfect for enjoying drinks and trying your hand at singing!

This was all made possible by the excellent service provided by the Killashee staff.  A few notable mentions are:   Ms. Natalie Wheelan, Wedding Coordinator, was so professional and kind.  She guided our niece and her fiancée every step of the way and made the planning so easy and less stressful.    Mr. Paul Byrne, Banqueting Manager, and his staff, provided wonderful service at the Welcoming Dinner, Wedding Reception, and BBQ the day after the wedding.  Mr. Byrne is very friendly, was responsive to our requests and his staff is very well organized.  Mr. Glenn Connolly and staff of the Bistro Bar were very friendly and attentive.  The food at the Bistro Bar was always delicious and can’t say enough of the wonderful drinks we enjoyed.  

It was a magical couple of days at the Killashee and our families, from Miami and Ireland, made wonderful memories which we will forever treasure.",5,2019,06,07
218,Poor treatment of Americans,"Restaurant staff were rude and officious.
We were singled out for poor treatment in the Bistro restaurant because we were Americans.
The place was virtually empty, and we got the table next to the kitchen.",2,2019,06,06
218,Night away and trip to the spa.,"Hotel was fantastic, rooms were really clean. Breakfast was amazing. 
But the spa... was sheer bliss. I was lucky enough to have a massage by a wonderful woman called Mairead. I really hope she gets to read this- she was brilliant. I felt like my whole body transformed into a relaxed dummy. I didn’t feel the hour go by and at the end I didn’t want to say goodbye! It was like therapy. If only I lived closer to Naas I would hire her personally. After my treatment Mairead set me up in the relaxation room and I was fit to sleep. 
We stayed in this hotel as we were going to the Spice Girls the night before in Croke Park and couldn’t get accommodation closer to Dublin. We all felt let down by the concert.. but the spa really made up for it. The thermal pools was like a bit of heaven on earth. Highly recommend the spa as the therapists are top of their game. Will 100% be coming back and asking for Mairead.",4,2019,06,05
218,Good hotel and family friendly.,Spent two nith with my wife and two children under four. We had a family room overlooking the Jack and Gill garden and it had plenty of room. The swimming pool and leisure center are big and have a children's pool. Only downside is that you have to leave the hotel and walk too it. The hotel restaurant is good but a little expensive and the breakfast is okay. Overall would stay here again and found the staff friendly and helpful. ,4,2019,06,05
218,"Disappointing,no response from management","I have stayed in kilashee ple ty if times, loved it used to go to summer camp here when it was a school so take great delight in staying with family and friends and eating here too, I stayed in March as a treat to my sister's my mum and my extended family joined for a meal, two out of four of us had an awful experience in the spa but was looked after as best they could on the day but ruined the experience and I had a bad experience with breakfast I emailed hotel directly I was told management would be in touch never happened and emailed again Wondering no response at all. I expressed in my original email my complaints wouldn't stop me from staying I just wanted them acknowledged, but now from lack of response I have lost any want to stay here again .",1,2019,06,05
218,Exceptional. Food was just amazing.,"I had lunch dinner and breakfast here. The food was incredible. I loved the hotel, room, staff, spa etc. We only stayed for one night but it felt like longer. There was a lot to do. Great location and we went to the cinema closeby also. ",5,2019,06,05
218,Killashee disappointing,"Didn’t realise the pool is in a separate building and you have to go outside across a car park to access, not convenient when you have a small child and a pregnant wife.Rooms far too hot over 25 degrees with the windows open if your setting yourself out as 4 star at least have air conditioning.Breakfast choice was again something you would expect in a 2 star,long delay for basic fried eggs.Pity as the hotel has a lot to offer on other fronts but needs to tighten up the basics.",2,2019,06,04
218,Return to Killashee,We stayed in Killashee once again but this time our family circumstances have changed so there is a different perspective on the hotel. As always we were greeted very friendly by the reception staff. Now having a 3 yr old with us the interest was more focused on the playground and pool. The playground is nice and a great place for the kids to use up their energy. The pool is really nice but be mindful that the pool is also a public membership area so it can be busy with hotel guests ad the public. Still very clean and well kept. The breakfast is plentiful and tasty.,4,2019,06,04
218,Killashee Hotel 30th May 2019,Very nice hotel in Naas outside Dublin with about a 40m drive to the city center. Excellent and spacious rooms. Big and busy health center with big swimming pool. Excellent outdoors. Good breakfast. Good wifi. ,4,2019,06,04
218,An Architectural beauty,"I stayed here for a night and I was astonished looking at the building structure . Even though the receptionist was very straight forward the room was nice and huge. Dinner at restaurant Bistro was really tasty and servers were very pleasant. Overall a good experience.
It would have been better if they could cover the walk way from Parking to hotel reception, as it's difficult to come to hotel with luggage etc while raining. Cheers,",4,2019,06,03
218,Could be amazing.. lacking TLC,"Booked the hotel for a girls weekend with my mum and sister as it was one of the few hotels that did a triple room. 
Hotel is situated not far from Naas town. The drive up the driveway is quite stunning and the hotel looks amazing. Lots of parking and well sign posted. The reception/ entrance foyer is grand and makes a good first impression. Check in was speedy but difficult to hear or get information as there were 3 functions on - the girl on reception apologised for the noise. 
Our room was in the old part of the hotel which is full of character with creaky floors, sash windows and traditional decor. The room was spacious with 2 double beds and a lovely view of the well presented gardens. Missing plug sockets near the bed and could do with dusting the skirting boards. The bathroom is very old fashioned with a traditional shower over the bath which leaks when you put the shower on full pressure. Paul Costelloe basic toiletries provided and lots of towels. Decor is very random and unfortunately doesn’t pay tribute to the buildings past. 
The gardens  are lovely for a walk round and include a children’s playground. There is also a playroom within the hotel. 
We had the table d’hote in Turners restaurant as part of our package. The restaurant is in a large ballroom style room which I think was maybe the old chapel. The menu was limited but everything was delicious. The service was good although the atmosphere felt very up tight and as if they were trying too hard to be upper class? 
Breakfast the following morning was also in Turners restaurant and was a shambles compared to the night before. Litter below the tables. Dirty floors. Staff with no organisation. Food was good but unfortunately for being an Irish hotel they had very little local ingredients! 
We were able to extend our check out free of charge which was a lovely touch and used the swimming pool. The pool and spa are 2 separate areas so unfortunately if you are looking for relaxation this isn’t the place to go. To use the pool you have to go through the gym and public areas. It is open to the general public and full of children. 
Verdict - lovely hotel for a family getaway but not for a relaxing break with friends or as a couple ",4,2019,06,03
218,Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Employees,"When pulling up to the Killashee Hotel, I was somewhat unsure what to expect, but the moment we stepped inside and where greeted by a very happy Matthew at checkin I knew we had made a good choice. 

We stayed in the Belling Wing and the room was very ornate, and Huge! On our first night we had dinner in the Bistro (Chicken Wings are amazing) and a few drinks in the bar.

 On Saturday we spent the morning at the Spa, and our treatments where perfect and very relaxing. Saturday night we ate in the restaurant, menu is limited, but food was again gorgeous, and back to the bar, where the champions league final was on, but plenty of seating. the Killashee should be very proud of their staff, each and everyone of them where so pleasant. 

Will definitely be back",5,2019,06,02
218,Perfect weekend away!,"Lovely hotel, big comfortable bedrooms. 
Had dinner in the bar both nights and both food and staff were fantastic. 
Used the hydrotherapy pool too and found it very relaxing.
Gardens well worth a look.
Would highly recommend!",5,2019,06,02
218,Killashee hotel,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, very helpful, gorgeous gardens and grounds, interesting history, the bistro was welcoming and food very nice, we would return but I would need a room with a little less walking as partially disabled.",5,2019,05,31
218,Great location,"We use the Kilashee as an overnight stop travelling between Belfast and Cork and vice versa. Great parking, excellent rooms, great food, superb friendly staff, always enjoy. Food quality has recently shown marked improvement. Only downside wine prices in Bistro restaurant slightly on the high side!",5,2019,05,30
218,Short Break,"We stayed for a short two night stay at the Killashee Hotel which is very impressive as you drive up the long driveway and catch your first glimpse of the hotel.  It is as impressive on the inside as it is on the outside with a nice blend of old with classy, modern styling.  The location was excellent as it is close to Kildare Shopping Village, Avoca and Dublin as well as the towns of Naas, Celbridge and Newbridge.  The fitness suite and pool facilities are fantastic with state of the art equipment provided.  Overall it is a lovely hotel and we will be recommending it and will be visiting again.",4,2019,05,30
218,Ladies weekend away,"Brilliant weekend from start to finish. Hotel is gorgeous with lovely gardens and leisure centre.
Staff were very friendly and helpful. Had dinner and breakfast there and both were very tasty.
The only negative was that there is no fridge in the room.",5,2019,05,28
218,Lovey but busy hotel.,"Lovely hotel, very friendly staff & amazing restaurant/spa services. The only down side it’s a very busy hotel. I think over my two day stay I saw two weddings, christening & work conference. Which is fine if your attending them but not for a relaxing weekend away. ",3,2019,05,28
218,Night away,"Stayed here on Friday 17th May - booked as a surprise for hubbys 50th birthday.  Did ask for a nice room and wow we were surprised - room absolutely fantastic, four poster bed, 2 comfy armchairs, spacious bathroom.  Also laid out a lovely plate with a couple of mini cakes and a Happy Birthday message.  Room spotless.  Lunch also gorgeous and service was spot on, staff friendly.  Only 2 minor things - the bar/bistro area although huge I didn't find it very comfortable to sit there for a while due to high stools and tables laid out for food.  I like to sit in a bar enjoy a drink and read a book so sat out in the lobby instead.  The other minor thing when we arrived at the bar area that evening although food was still being served my husband asked for a sandwich but was told that the chef didn't have anything to make a sandwich with they could only do a ham & cheese toastie!!!  With that said the breakfast the following morning was delicious and fresh.  Great place to stay & treat yourself!!!!",4,2019,05,27
218,Kellys,"Very comfortable, enjoyable couple of days stay.  Rooms were a bit dark and gloomy but as I said very comfortable. Was confused when to get to our room on floor 2 we had to push the No 3 button in the lift. Wasn't explained that we then had to walk to another lift on third floor and go downwards. ",4,2019,05,16
218,Family overnight,"We stayed overnight and for the most part it was perfect but there were a few issues that we had. Most of them were resolved. 
Firstly we were overcharged for the food, and charged for more people than were actually there. Credits were later resolved. There was also no remote control for the TV in the room and we rang down to reception to get one, they said that they would send one up but never did. 
Apart from that the room was lovely and clean and we used the leisure centre the following day. Staff were very friendly too.",3,2019,05,14
218,Family time,We took our mum to Kilashee House as a present for her birthday and she enjoyed every minute. Beautiful hotel and gardens and a lovely leisure centre. Staff were really friendly and the rooms were gorgeous. Gorgeous food.. Will be back!!,5,2019,05,14
218,Weekend Family Break,"The hotel was very busy when we got there and we were told our room was not ready yet but they would check took phone number and said would ring when ready- this was at 230, we went back up to the desk at 3 to be told still not ready after over an hour waiting i went up again and was told that our key had been given out and we were checked in already.....then receptionist found the key cards behind reception, she didn't apologise for this and needless to say over an hour waiting in a hotel lobby with kids is no fun.Also we were told nothing about where dinner or breakfast etc... were so it wasnt a great check in.Room was just the usual - we had no view.

Thankfully the stay got better.There are nice grounds to walk about and a playground.
The swimming pool is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and the hotel itself is quite maze like as it is two different buildings put together so you are up and down in lifts all over the place.They have a indoor playroom and a kids club as well.

Dinner in the bar was ok, not a very wide range of choice to the menu. Breakfast was very busy and maybe that is why all the glasses, plates, cutlery were all stained and dirty, which was pretty off putting.good enough choice of food though.

All in all i can see that on a bright sunny weekend this hotel would be a nice getaway as you can explore the grounds with kids.",3,2019,05,13
218,Bank Holiday Break,"Beautiful hotel has retained the old look with a mod cons, rooms very comfortable, warm and cosy, staff very friendly and courteous, food was delicious, so much to see and do, would definitely recommend this hotel, already planning a return trip ",5,2019,05,08
218,Beautiful Hotel,"Wonderful staff. Loved the surprise in our room for my 50th birthday. Had lunch in the bistro and food was excellent.
Breakfast was good but would have liked beans. Scrambled eggs and sausages were amazing.",5,2019,05,08
218,Lovely rooms. Just a pity we didn’t know about the other breakfast area and didn’t get courtesy races transport,"Stayed at Killashee for Punchestown races. Great place to stay as it’s close by the races. 
Positives:
Really comfy beds, large triple room and dark heavy curtains for sleeping.
The staff are friendly and the grounds spectacular 
Negatives:
Room was not set up for three persons - only towels/soaps for two but it was sorted when I informed reception.
No courtesy bus to races available - we were told the bus couldn’t arrive because of traffic yet out taxi got there from hotel and races in less than 10 mins so where was the traffic? This cost us extra as had to get two taxis for the group.
We didn’t know there was another area for breakfast. We went straight to the bistro section that just has buffet style breakfast. Although this was nice we were later disappointed to find out there was another section, which was brighter with good views, and you more breakfast options to order. Given the cost of rooms it would have been nice to be told this when checking in and to have this option. I felt a little cheated I didn’t get this. 

If you go make sure you know all the breakfast options!",4,2019,05,07
218,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here with our 2 young kids and have to say, it was a great experience. The grounds are beautiful with a good playground. The pool was perfect for young children as it has a separate swimming area for them. We didn't feel selfconscious in the restaurant as there were so many families and actually, we were in a room off the bistro restaurant which was even better. There is an indoor play room if the weather isn't great. My son had a small accident at breakfast and the restaurant manager was brilliant. Very caring and helpful.",5,2019,05,07
218,Overnight Getaway,"Had a lovely stay last night at this gorgeous location. Lovely dinner in the bistro last night and breakfast this morning in the restaurant. We had a swim in the pool, loved that it had a shallow area for the kids. The butterfly gardens and playground are fabulous. Would definitely recommend for a night away. An incident this morning at breakfast saw management deal with a minor emergency with such professionalism and care. 
Thanks for a great stay. We all look forward to coming back!",5,2019,05,06
218,Great Sunday Lunch Spot,"We had a wonderful lunch here on the 5th May.
The lunch was served in the bar, which had a great atmosphere.
The menu is great, having been recently revised.
Kellie and her gang could not have been nicer.  Literally service with a wonderful smile.",5,2019,05,06
218,Nice place to stay,"A really nice place,, food menu a bit limited if you are on a long stay, staff very good and a really good selection at breakfast. Bedrooms met the standard with ample space and seating. Didn't have time to fully explore the gardens",4,2019,05,05
218,Stunning Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights during the Punchestown Festival.... From the moment we arrived ( which was late morning ) our stay was a delight. We were offered complimentary prosecco until our room was ready which was before noon.. a welcome treat following our flight. !! The room was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. The breakfast was delicious, plenty of choice and fresh.  
Bar service was good and the lunch service quick and tasty.

Can't wait to return next year !!",5,2019,05,05
218,Wedding,This Hotel was amazing a bit of a maze but very clean and friendly staff. Food in the bar and at the wedding was superb.   the Grounds of the hotel were beautiful and lovely walks around it.  I found the price was a bit much.  Lovely old furniture in the bedrooms.,5,2019,04,30
218,Pleasant Visit,"We attended a friends wedding, really well maintained and run hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful ,food was tasty and the breakfast was very good the following morning. All in a good experience.",4,2019,04,29
218,Excellent,"Beautiful hotel I can only rave about it, lots of twists and turns amazing stay for a family wedding, will definitely return for a few days, staff professional friendly and they couldn’t do enough for us ",5,2019,04,29
218,Disappointing stay,"It is a rare opporuntity for myself and my partner to have a night a home, we decided to treat ourselves to some luxury despite the cost. The disappointment of our stay before we even arrived at kilashee.
1) As part of our stay we had dinner booked in Turners restaurant, however the day before our stay I got a phonecall informing me Turners would not be opening that night, our reservation was moved to the Bistro. We were upgraded to a junior suite due to this inconvenience.
2) We arrived at kilashee after 4 pm, despite check in being 3 pm we were told our room would be ready in 15 minutes, they would ring us when it was ready. At 5pm I returned to the reception to query the room, initially reception were unable to contact housekeeping, they then had to change us to different room. Two hours after check in we finally got to our room.
3) With the exception of the size of the room the Junior suite was no different to any standard room I have stayed in other hotels. The room was very colm, with a draft coming through the window. 
4) Our reservation in the Bistro was for 8.30 pm, when we we're seated we were told we would have to order all three courses at once as the kitchen was closing, we were also very rushed throughout the meal. 
5) The Breakfast was also very poor, service was poor and quality of food. My partners glass was also cracked on either side of the glass.",2,2019,04,28
218,One night stay,"Beautiful hotel with excellent gardens. Staff friendly but badly trained and managed, specifically in the restaurant area. The seating was very dirty caused by staff wiping tables down to quickly and leaving all the debris in the seating. The food was lovely and the rooms spacious.",3,2019,04,28
218,Great for Families,"Very spacious hotel with a touch of old world charm and modern but casual convenience. Nice grounds to walk with kids and we especially loved the Butterfly Garden dedicated to Debra Ireland, really touching tribute. The Irish National Stud is about 20min drive and well worth a visit as is Newbridge Silverware. Killashee is the perfect base for date trips and the food in The Bistro was excellent. ",4,2019,04,28
218,Wonderful place ,We stayed here last Tuesday 23rd April and it was by far the best hotel we stayed in beautiful walks around the grounds including Butterly garden which our kids enjoyed the service is second to none and the staff were exceptional and couldn’t do enough for us a wonderful experience and fabulous food to we will definitely be back and could not recommend this hotel highly enough ,5,2019,04,27
218,Lovely family stay,"Really enjoyed our stay at killashee.  The hotel is like a castle and beautiful gardens.
The food is great and friendly service. 
My two boys had a great time at the kids club and swimming pool.  We will be back again",4,2019,04,27
218,2 night stay family stay,"Plus points. 
Beautiful grounds with lots of outdoor seating areas
Spacious rooms
Friendly staff 
Child friendly e.g. Playground, kids club, kids playroom, fairy trail, butterfly trail etc
Lots of lobby and indoor seating areas/rooms. 
Good breakfast
Countryside setting although a short drive to Naas Town centre 

Negatives. 
Rooms far too warm. Heat in rooms way above average temps for rest of the hotels. 
Bistro overpriced for standard of food served and quite limited selection though service was good, staff friendly and efficient. 
Swimming pool detached from hotel. circa 7 mins walk from our room and have to cross the car park with kids in tow",3,2019,04,26
218,We will be back!,"Nice grounds, spacious playground, delicious food, large room, friendly staff. We enjoyed our stay and the kids were happy which meant happy adults! We will be back! 

Only draw back is the leisure facilities are a nice walk from your room and not part of the hotel. You need to walk across a car park to get there. We were not prepared with kids for the walk back to the hotel but if you bring a jacket you'll be fine. ",4,2019,04,24
218,Killashee House Hotel,"Stayed for my partners birthday. Happy Birthday plate in room was a lovely touch. Decor, grounds & food fabulous. Check out the Snug Pub, hidden jem where we met some great people & enjoyed some great music!!",4,2019,04,24
218,"Beautiful, relaxing stay in a gorgeous setting","Would definitely recommend a spa or leisure break in the hotel, great facilities, food and service. Set in lovely grounds, it feels like a nice escape but is in close proximity to Naas town which is very self contained.",5,2019,04,24
218,Wedding,"Myself and my husband stayed there over night at a wedding. The wedding was spectacular and the food was amazing. Attention to detail was superb by the hotel and staff.  The fault i have is the rooms. For €170 for the night i would have expected a working shower , not have to haul bags up three flights of stairs as there was no elevator to the room . Hot water coming out if the cold tap in bathroom. The next morning having to get ur own breakfast instead of being served breakfast . I have stayed in hotels for less per night and was a much better place to stay.  In regard to weddings parties etc yes its an excellent venue for that but not for a stay overnight. ",3,2019,04,23
218,Good for families,"Good value,plenty for kids to do with playground, swimming pool and kids club from 7-9.  Bistro the only let down, food lovely but not a great setting. Apart from that it’s a gray option if you fancy getting out of Dublin with the kids for a night!",4,2019,04,22
218,Family Weekend away,"We stayed in Killashee for two nights last wekend, we had not been back here for many hyears and it was great to come back for our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel and grounds are as amazing now as it was back then. The weather was fablous and made walking around the grounds a real treat and easy way to relax. We used the leisure centre for three days and it really is great, the pool sauna, steam room etc all very clean. My wife used the spa and was very impressed. I didnt use the gym but I was very impressed with the huge amount of equipment on offer for the people to use, it is a very busy gym with alot of people using it daily. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. I was impressed by the staff and management, for the breakfast time in the restaurant and in the bistro there is lots of staff on duty but also a strong visible presence of managers who co-oridinate the staff and all together they ensure that all customers are served in a very quick, polite and officient manager. The hotel was very busy this weeeknd with familes and the kids club, playground, treasure trail hunt provided a great time for kids, thanks to staff and management we had a lovely weekend. We cannot wait to come back again very soon.",5,2019,04,22
218,Many Highs and many lows. ,"Attended the hotel for an awards ceremony recently. I think I experienced everything the hotel had to offer. Restaurant, bar, function suite, breakfast the next morning. 
It’s most definitely a mixed bag. 
Some staff I experienced were interested in their jobs. Some just rude and bored. Function suite was a mess. Bar very busy. One member of staff was dreadfully ignorant. Under pressure but no need. 
Dinner afterwards was dreadful, a €18 tasteless burger, saved only by a wonderful manager who was so rushed off his feet. Trying his best to accommodate many of his customers. Always with a smile. 
Rooms are fine. Not luxury. Maybe need a little tender care. Towels grey. Old. 
Buffet breakfasts are tough. You need volume for them to work. Maybe I hit a quiet time. Food in bain Marie’s was cold. Lovely girls serving. Could not do enough. 
Breakfast was not good. 

",3,2019,04,21
218,Easter Family Trip ,We stayed here last night family of three. There are plenty of activities for kids. The gardens are stunning. We eat lunch breakfast and dinner in the hotel and really enjoyed all the food. Our son went to the kids club and had a great time. Totally recommend for a lovely trip ,5,2019,04,21
218,Girls weekend away,"This is a lovely hotel, from the beautiful drive from the main road to the hotel entrance, the lovely grounds with walks marked out, the professional and friendly staff, the relaxing spa to the excellent food in both their main restaurant and the Bistro. We were a group of 4 friends who all really enjoyed our time at this hotel and would fully recommend it.",5,2019,04,20
218,Sheer relaxation !,"Perfect in every way!
The Killashee makes other top hotels look like hostels! The service was perfect the rooms big beautiful and so so comfortable, the quality of food was better than anywhere else we have ever eaten. I know we will definitely be back very soon. ",5,2019,04,17
218,Nice breakaway,"Overall a lovely place. Dinner was nice but slightly overdone (this can happen). The selection at breakfast was very good also. The grounds are amazing and well worth a nice stroll. The facilities were adequate and not too crowded. 

We had an incident due to a maintenance issue, which highlighted a safety issue, and lack of proper procedure. Although these things can happen, we were disappointed with the overall outcome of the situation and the entire lack of followup. We didn't cause any fuss and wanted to make sure the worst couldn't happen nor that it happen again. To help placated the situation commitments were made by staff but were not honoured... a compounding of disappointment to what could have been a saving grace. ",3,2019,04,17
218,Lovely Hotel,Lovely old building with an amazing history. The room was clean and well presented. Reception staff were welcoming and friendly. The food in the Bistro was of fantastic quality and extremely well presented.,4,2019,04,15
218,Another excellent visit to Killashee!,"After our excellent stay last year, we decided to stay here again on our last night before flying out. Again very comfortable rooms, quirky elevator system to get to the rooms, excellent service, very good food...and at a reasonable cost. We will be back next year I’m sure!",5,2019,04,15
218,"Beautiful, breath taking Hotel",Would highly recommend this Hotel. The moment you drive up the lane it is just breathtaking.. Beautiful gardens. So close to beautiful towns. You feel you are miles away from everything    but you are so close. Believe me you won't want to leave  Looking forward to my return visit ,5,2019,04,15
218,The three amigos,"Food excellent but afternoon tea over priced staff were so friendly and helpful rooms huge spotless value for money and would go back in summer grounds are fabulous too overall I'd come back and stay ,",4,2019,04,14
218,A step back in time! Where time stands peacefully still,"  
Fabulous hotel.bespoke Victorian gardens. Helpful friendly staff and reserved in its historical Victorian beauty &Charm! Drenched in history and each room has its very own story to tell! Fantastic spa and hydrotherapy pool",5,2019,04,13
218,Relaxing stay at Killashee,Very nice hotel in a quite location in Naas. Reem was spacious and in a quite area of the hotel. Breakfast was more than sufficient with plenty of choice. Overall i would recommend a stsy at this hotel.,4,2019,04,12
218,Family Stay,Had a great time in Killashee the staff could not be more helpful. Hotel is big and spaceious our 17 month old son loved his freedom walking around and the children room is great. We visited Kildare Village and Kildare Open Farm which is about 25 mins drive away. ,5,2019,04,10
218,Wow great place to vist stunning grounds great food room very high standards room 146 fit for a king /queen,"Great  hotel stunning grounds  food excellent 
Room 146 wow fit for a king or queen room stunning  very high on cleaniess  would stay again  
We stayed for a wedding  planning on a return in nov do knot miss this one",4,2019,04,09
218,Relaxing break,"Nice place for a relaxing break. Food quality was excellent. A bit overpriced for what some items were, a wrap with small side salad for almost 8€ at lunch. Bistro, lobby, gardens and entrance were fabulous. Attention to detail with small fairy garden! So nice. Corridors needed TLC with some wallpaper torn and paint chipped. Room was lovely and spacious. Breakfast quality excellent. Pity about the service ",3,2019,04,09
218,Really nice stay at Killashee Hotel,I am giving the Killashee Hotel a rating of excellent and the reason is their wonderful staff who are so friendly and welcoming and can't do enough to help you out.  The hotel itself is very nice - a little dated and very confusing to get to your room - need to go up one lift - walk across a gallery and down another; we kept meeting people who were lost!  We were a group of 4 and we ate in both restaurants in the hotel and all rated the food as superb.  We are considering returning for another stay in the autumn.,5,2019,04,08
218,Lovely hotel,Couldn't fault it. Beautiful old world hotel with very friendly staff. Rooms big and well equipped. Didn't use the leisure centre. Breakfast had large variety of buffet food available and also food to order. Delicious,5,2019,04,08
218,Providing feedback as asked,"The hotel it self is very nice, rooms to me felt outdated and basic for the price charged, there was no pillow menu available and i had an awful nights sleep as the pillows were terrible and i suffer from shoulder pain and it was quite bad. There was mould on the shower wall, but nothing else to have any quarrels about. Staff were excellent and attentive and the food was excellent. ",3,2019,04,08
218,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here with a group of friends. Got a good rate for b&b with evening meal. This is a very nice hotel with real old world charm, the staff are excellent, the food is very good although the bistro menu felt a little limited. breakfast was good.",4,2019,04,07
218,Fantastic Rooms,"Great experience. Food was magnificent. There could be an improvement of the service.
My room was absolutely beautiful. I was at a wedding in the old pat of the hotel and the function room was perfect. ",5,2019,04,02
218,Very impressed!,"Stayed at the hotel on a very busy Saturday night as I was working at an event. My first time staying at this property. I was extremely impressed with the rooms, facilities and most of all the staff who were very friendly and efficient.  Will return soon. ",5,2019,04,02
218,A really enjoyable couple of days,"What can I say. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Highly recommend this hotel for any type of relaxing break. Friendly staff, super clean rooms and facilities. Delicious food and affordable. Ideal wedding location.",5,2019,03,28
218,Birthday weekend away,"3rd visit in 3 years . Love this place. Just spent weekend there to celebrate my 50th birthday.  Present from my friend . We had only checked into our room 207 when a lovely plate of desserts arrived at our door to wish me a happy birthday.  We booked dinner in The Bistro which as always was lovely . Very busy night but the staff still had time to celebrate several birthdays.  As I finished another lovely plate of mini desserts arrived accompanied by staff singing , a lovely little treat. Thank you. Grounds of hotel are lovely and worth a walk around .",4,2019,03,26
218,Really enjoyable stay!,"I booked a stay in Killashee as part of a Christmas present for my husband. We had tickets for Christy Moore who was playing on Saturday, February 9th. I booked the room at the front desk and unfortunately I cant remember the name of the lady who looked after me but she was very pleasant and helpful. 

We arrived at the hotel that Saturday afternoon and we were checked in pretty quickly with no delays. The receptionist was very helpful, we told her we were hoping to have dinner before the concert and she immediately booked a table for us in the restaurant so that we would not be disappointed as the hotel was quite busy that evening.

We headed straight to our room which was really nice and very clean. The only thing I will say is that the room was a bit cold. It was also cold when we returned that night and I made a call to the front desk to ask the night porter about the heating. Shortly after the heating was turned on. 

Our stay was brief, we left early the next morning and unfortunately didnt have a chance to use any of the facilities. Breakfast was amazing, the food and service was terrific. Thanks to Karl who looked after us, he was very friendly and helpful.

We would like to stay again sometime in the future and hopefully make full use of the facilities when we do.",5,2019,03,25
218,Disappointing,"Chose this hotel to spend a night to get away for a relaxing break and it's only an hours drive from our house. On arrival the girl at reception was okay, not very welcoming, just said what she had to. Rooms are basic but warm, spacious and comfortable. We wanted to chill out in the lobby and read but this wasn't to be. There were kids everywhere and they were so noisy. Booked dinner in the bistro which was very tasty and staff were lovely there. Sat in the bar then with a bottle of wine. This was also noisy until the last of the kids went to bed at about 10pm. Nice atmosphere after that with a girl singing which was nice. Slept well until after 730am when awoken by doors banging and children running up and down. Breakfast was lovely, loads to choose from. Checked out before 12pm. If you're looking for a peaceful break away to relax and chill this is not the place to go. Wouldn't recommend it. ",3,2019,03,23
218,Stay away from Turners Restaurant,"Stayed for one night to celebrate a friends birthday. Bedroom were lovely, spotlessly clean and beds comfortable. Spa very nice too. Had a nice lunch in the bistro but then went to Turners for dinner. Beautiful restaurant but food is appalling. Very few guests there. I had a slow cooked lamb which tasted fatty and looked like a cheap cut this  wh was served with this fried ball of again lamb and a small amount of potato. No veg Barr 8 broad beans. My friend had hake the waitress dumped this green stuff all over her plate and ran off. Green sauce tasted of water and was boiling when served. No seasoning r taste on any of the dishes it was horrible. Such a let down. At end of meal r complaints were said to the server who offered us a complimentary drink. Service was appalling empty drink glasses were left on the table and not removed when we were eating. Definitely stay away from this restaurant .",3,2019,03,23
218,St Patrick's Day Wedding,"Well what can we say except we had the best 3 days of our lives , truly magical day , the staff in this hotel are second to none they pulled out all the stops to make it a fairytale,  nothing was a  problem they  went above & beyond for us , thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all the love and kindness and you showed us and our guests ,i cannot recommend your hotel enough,  Chefs are michelin star  food was amazing plenty of it no one went hungry 

Mr & Mrs Sammon 😍😍😍😍",5,2019,03,20
218,Comfortable and pleasant night,I was part of a wedding party that stayed in the hotel  I was very impressed with the size and quality of the rooms  Food was excellent and staff very friendly and helpful   Would definitely stay here again for a weekend break. ,5,2019,03,20
218,Dissappointed Guests,"Service from some staff was not great. 
Food was really good, found it to be a little expensive
Rooms was nice and clean and standard size 
Drive to the hotel has really lovely views take time to take this in

218,Excellent,Great stay for a wedding. Couldn't fault the place. Food and accommodation spot on. Staff friendly and efficient. Would recommend for a nice quiet break away for couples or families. Nice venue for weddings,5,2019,03,20
218,Wedding Stay - Staff a credit to the hotel.,"Just back from a 3 night wedding weekend.
The drive up to the hotel is magical I must say and it's an ideal wedding venue.
From check in to check out the staff are absolutely amazing in this hotel , so so pleasant and attentive. Nothing was ever too much trouble, the food was excellent couldn't fault it in any way.
Made use of the leisure facilities and I must say they are spotlessly clean and very comfortable to use which was a plus!.
The rooms are good although a little dated but had everything you'd need , the beds are huge and very comfortable. I was really impressed by the water pressure in the shower too it was excellent.
Was there primarily for a wedding and everything was just excellent really couldn't fault it from the staff to the food it was amazing.
Would definitely return in the best future to Killashee!.",4,2019,03,19

218,Not a 4* hotel,"This hotel is a 2*/2.5* at best! I booked as we have been in the area for a family wedding and wanted a couple of extra days to explore and relax having seen photos and reviews online I was satisfied that we would have a pleasant stay. Although our stay has been pleasant in the sense the service and food is lovely the hotel it’s self is very deceiving. On arrival the hotel looks very grand and the bistro is lovely also with good food, although a limited menu. However the bedrooms are a massive let down for me and not what I would expect from a 4* hotel! The rooms are dark and drab! Not inviting what so ever! Not what you need when you’ve booked a stay at a hotel which is something of a luxury for us! Beds are clean which is something, however carpets have marks on, our bedroom door does not lock we have had to put a chair up against the door to stop our 2 year old escaping! The bathroom is the same although clean I still cringe having to use the bathroom with the door only shutting from the inside once locked. Towels also smell very musty as if they have either not been dried properly or have been sat for a very long time! We haven’t even had chance to see or use the spa facilities yet, maybe they will surpass my expectations however I’m not convinced. I’m currently sat in the room writing this! Very much looking forward to leaving tomorrow morning.",2,2019,03,19
218,Wedding stay,"beautiful Hotel with lovely staff however very pricey and you get much better value in other hotels of the same standard.  
Try to watch for any special offers if they come up and be wary of the leisure complex as the one you can use for free is not really part of the hotel and a bit of a let down. ",4,2019,03,19
218,Family confirmation celebration,excellent hotel for a special occasion.  We were very well looked after.  The food and staff were excellent.   Every need was met.  Thanks so much to everyone who made the day so special for my daughter.  She really enjoyed her day. ,5,2019,03,19
218,Top Hotel.,Best have we have stayed in. The staff on arrival very friendly. The room was so spacious and couldn't have been cleaner. The staff in the bistro and restaurant was excellent and great value. The grounds are well worth a walk around.  Cannot wait for our next break. ,5,2019,03,18
218,First class Killashee!,"Lovely hotel & gardens. Service, food, rooms etc, were first class.
Most importantly the staff were pleasant, courteous & efficient.
I would highly recommend the Killashee Hotel all round but particularly for weddings.",5,2019,03,18
218,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,"This is the second time in a month I’m visiting Killashee Hotel. It’s a beautiful place with an impressive entrance area, spacious family rooms, gorgeous surroundings and most importantly incredible staff. From the reception to the bistro and breakfast room the staff is helpful, friendly and professional. I can’t wait for our next visit! ",5,2019,03,18
218,Amazing St Patrick’s Weekend Getaway,"What a gem in Naas!  The staff are super friendly, the decor to die for and scrumptious food.

Our room is big and beds comfy. Our son loves the pool & burns off steam swimming.  Highly recommend a stay here.",5,2019,03,17
218,Very unsatisfactory,"Rooms are quite dated and aged. My bathroom had numerous layers of grubby silicone aroun the sink. Furniture was all warped. The breakfast is of a very poor standard, and things like an Americano coffee are extras.",1,2019,03,17
218,Birthday Surprise,Everything was top class here. Junior suite was amazing and bed was a dream to sleep in. Staff were extremely helpful and welcoming and the service was amazing. I will definitely be returning here again.,5,2019,03,17
218,Regular visitor to this hotel 👍👍,"I conduct Automotive Business training on a regular basis in Ireland and use this hotel regularly. Firstly the location and building are beautiful, decorated and furnished wonderfully too. Both the meeting rooms and bedrooms are spacious and comfortable with great facilities. On top of this the food is wonderful and the service from every member of staff I have dealt with has been second to none.. finally, considering all this the prices at the Killashee are very reasonable too.. 
highly recommend 👍👍👍

218,Food,"Excellent place, great food, good location. Great to get away and escape it all. Staff very friendly and rooms are nice. Extensive wine menu. Gym is the best I have ever seen - swimming pool, bikes, treadmills and even classes which guests can use ",5,2019,03,13
218,Lovely grounds,"I stayed here for one night for a wedding. The venue itself was amazing, food was amazing. Staff were friendly. Room was clean. Breakfast was great, something there for everyone. The only thing I could fault on was that the bedroom was difficult to find and was a long way from the function room.",5,2019,03,13
218,Disappointing for 4 Star,"On first impression Kilashee is fabulous, the food was delicious, and most of the staff were nice. Unfortunatley the bar staff were not very tentative or obliging, the rooms all seemed a bit disjointed and very confusing to get to.  Spa treatments were not as award winning as they claim, and also felt a bit hard done by, with the hot shower facility not working in treatment room, which ate into my spa treatment time.  All in all an average experience.",3,2019,03,12
218,"""Wonderfull weekend""","the smile on my wifes face says it all about the killashee hotel.
great sized rooms,beautifully furnished,quality food from breakfast to dinner,and service
and staff  the  jewel in its crown.
we will be back!",5,2019,03,12
218,Girls Trip,"Lovely hotel, rooms lovely and comfortable, restaurant and bistro both excellent and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. Found staff very helpful and polite. Little out of Naas town would need to get a taxi if going out. Only 5 mins or less in a taxi.",5,2019,03,12
218,Surprise birthday ,Absolutely fantastic stay at this hotel. Booked for my daughters birthday as she didn’t want a party but to spend time with her cousins. So a 10 11 and 14 year old and myself booked it for a night. At booking on the phone I explained who was staying and why just a bit of chat to the girl who was taking the booking. This was a surprise for my daughter and nieces. When we arrived  the birthday surprise was met with gasps from the girls at the beautiful hotel and more wows when we went inside. We were early for check in but were delighted our room was ready. The room had two doubles and a single roll away bed ideal for us but the most amazing part were the chocolates and happy birthday slice of cake in the room for my daughter. The delight and excitement were unbelievable and it just made the surprise that bit more special. The staff were just so helpful and welcoming I really can’t fault. Breakfast was a feast and was thoroughly enjoyed by us all. My niece is celiac and the staff took great care with her food they took her through what she could and couldn’t have and she had lots of choices. Thanks for an amazing stay and we will definitely be back again. ,5,2019,03,10
218,Disappointing stay,"Having stayed here before I thought it would be nostalgic to stay for my husband's birthday.not a cheap overnight but thought it would be worth it.i was disappointed with it's claim of 4 star as it lacked what I think that quality should be.starting with the drive up the avenue to the house which now has gaudy electrical screens to advertise....ruining the look immediately.
On the night we stayed there was some fundraiser that had the place packed (bye bye my quiet romantic night) as they had people in costumes singing and practising .
Our pricey wine with dinner was brought with cheap mismatched sizes of glasses...4 star...no....the next morning we were made wait for 20 mins in a queue outside the breakfast room like it was a fast food restaurant..4 star...no.
There was no explanation nor apology and when approached that perhaps they could open their bistro(2nd restaurant beside breakfast room) the answer was no....
Toilet cubicle took third attempt for a clean one.
really disappointed with the stay overall",3,2019,03,10
218,extortionate bill,"On the 3rd of March 2019 I was driving on a road close to this hotel and got stuck in a snow storm. After being pulled out of the ditch by a local farmer and his tractor I looked up the closest place to stay as I was unable to get home to Waterford . My phone died in the 4 hour ordeal it took to get from Dublin to Naas. I checked in and told the duty manager my story and searched the hotel for a charger but I couldn't get one. I wanted  to let my family know where I was and to check that my friends were ok as they were travelling on the same route . The following morning I got a shock when I was presented with a phone bill. No sense of humanity . They should be ashamed of their billing system and I don't know how they justify it. This hotel made a bad experience into a very expensive auwful experience. A total lack of ethics. €110 for the room , €30 for dinner and a glass of wine and €175 for using their phone. .. A total scam and not fair. Price wasn't mentioned anywhere.",1,2019,03,08
218,Fabulous ,"Love this hotel, serves delicious afternoon tea. Visit it regularly for tea and scones which are served by friendly and efficient staff. Great place to meet friends and family for a catch up. The decor is beautiful and hotel is well kept. 
Have attended functions at this hotel and have never been disappointed. ",4,2019,03,06
218,So relaxing,"We were greeted by a lovely girl laura that showed us to out lockers and told us about the facilities.
I went with my mam and sister as a girly day out. We used the hydrotherapy pool which is lovely but if you can't swim, I could just about stand on my tippy toes and I'm 5foot. But it was lovely and warm and relaxing. 

We all had a facial, back massage, scalp massive and dry flotation. I was looked after by the lovely Lisa who was so friendly and welcoming and explained everything she was doing step by step. She seemed genuinely concerned when I explained that I was very stressed and tense.

The elemis facial was AMAZING. 
And I felt like a new woman after the back and scalp massage. 

I enjoyed the dry flotation and found it relaxing but my sister and mam weren't mad on it.

We will definitely be back again in the future.",5,2019,03,06
218,Definatelly we will come back !,"I spent with my little one(3years old) a weekend in Killashee hotel,and we had a beautifull experience. Very pleasant place ti stay in. Great service,profesional staff.
Even was a wet weekend,and we didnt had the chance to explore the gardens,we enjoyt a huge walk inside.My little one was delighted ! 
Definatelly we will come back !
Thank you for great time !",5,2019,03,06
218,Lovely relaxing night away,"We just had a lovely relaxing night away in the Killashee House Hotel, couldn’t fault the place. The staff are  all outstanding for professionalism and so friendly. The Hotel was so clean in all areas. Gardens are beautiful. Really enjoyed our stay here and will be back. ",5,2019,03,05
218,Relaxing getaway,"Cannot recommend this place highly enough, lovely staff, rooms, the food was delicious, lovely vibe to the place. Will definitely be coming back to stay and recommending it to my friends. Looking forward to coming back. ",5,2019,03,05
218,Beautiful building in great location.,"This is a lovely old building with friendly staff and a relaxed calm feeling to it. The bedrooms are enormous perhaps too big for a single traveler or a couple as there was a lot of empty space. Also the tv was so small you couldn’t watch it it was more suited to a small room and definitely couldn’t be watched from the sofa or the bed ! There were things in the bathroom that were fantastic, lots of space, two sinks but the shower was a fixed one so wasn’t adaptable. The furnishings are in keeping with the style of the hotel but were very dark and in general could do with lightening up . We used the hairdressers at the spa which was overpriced we felt and we also didn’t feel we were pampered as from start to finish our appointment lasted ten minutes for a wash and blow dry . On our last day we couldn’t get a table for breakfast as the hotel was full and there was a massive queue out into the reception area the staff however were brilliant and did their utmost to serve everyone .",4,2019,03,03
218,Excellent spa visit,Had an afternoon pamper session in Killashee spa. Surroundings were fantastic .. thermal spa relaxing and not too busy. Lovely relaxation area . So quiet I fell asleep . Treatments were excellent full body massage and facial followed by sorbet . Lots of advice on skin analysis and products. Highly recommend.,5,2019,03,03
218,Spa noisy,"surprised and Very disappointed with my experience in the kilashee spa... staff were exceptionally noisy which made it any thing but relaxing. The staff gather in an open area and could be heard from every treatment room I was in (and they were quite a distance away) which made it next to impossible to relax and get the full benefit of the treatments. The relaxation room was right next to the noisy staff area which allowed no quiet area for spa users. Staff were noisy in the corridors, as they entered/exited the relaxation room, every where! It seems like a great fun place to work but Just not the experience you would expect in a 4star spa. 
Overall, very disappointed and would not recommend if you are looking for a relaxing spa experience.",1,2019,03,03
218,Fantastic grilled steak,On a business trip and met at this lovely hotel for dinner. Had a fantastic meal and grilled ribeye steak to die for defiantly the best I had in Ireland. Definitely will return and have a repeat visit and stay the night.,5,2019,03,02
218,Relaxing weekend away.,Myself & husband spent the weekend here from the 15/2/19-17/2/19. On arrival we where greeted by a very friendly & welcoming Receptionist. We then spent a lovely relaxing afternoon in the hotels leisure centre/swimming pool & then a lovely evening in the hotels Bistro. The food & staff couldn't have been nicer. On the Saturday we enjoyed afternoon tea followed by treatments in the Spa. That evening we had a fabulous meal in the restaurant followed by drinks in the bar where we were very warmly welcomed by the bar manager Paul. We highly recommend this hotel. The staff from start to finish were extremely friendly & professional.,5,2019,02,25
218,Expensive and overrated,We stayed for a birthday treat. Service at reception was appalling. Made to wait in a queue for far too long before they got more staff to help. First impressions count and ours wasnt great. The room was nice but not worth the money. I expected more if honest. The food was lovely but very overpriced and the menu was very limited.,3,2019,02,20
218,Excellent hotel,Overall it is a really great hotel. Couldn't fault it. Rooms were exquisite. Staff were very friendly. We had dinner in Turners restaurant adn it was gorgeous. Lovely gardens for a nice walk afterwards. ,5,2019,02,19
218,Will not be returning here,"Not good and not worth the 180euro. 

First room we got was a disaster in the older part of the hotel, obviously had to been slept in or even hoovered/cleaned in a few days. There were dead flies and other insects around the bed, window and hallway. Second room we got was grand, dead insects again in the bath tub wasn’t ideal. 

Staff did what they could do accommodate but the damage was already done.",1,2019,02,19
218,Ms sarah rogan,"Food quality was poor for both the lunch and dinner. The place felt dead with little atmosphere. There was no towels in our room, which meant I had to run down to reception the next morning. The breakfast was nice ",2,2019,02,19
218,Definitely not a 4 star,"Arrived late afternoon to our room (which was quite a trek away in the Belling Wing, including going up in one elevator, along a corridor and down in another elevator) to find it was a double and not a twin as requested. Housekeeping arrived promptly to correct it once we called reception.
Lots of staff around the hotel but service was terrible! We were waiting a long time for a drink from the bar. A shining light was Clodagh, who served us dinner in the bistro. She was the most clued in member of staff we met during our stay. She was professional, pleasant and extremely helpful. Another female bar tender was very helpful and courteous but sadly, I didn’t catch her name. 
Otherwise we seemed to have lengthy waits for service, even while standing at the bar. 
Rooms are nothing to write home about (we had no view and it was too far away from the main part of the hotel) but the bathroom was lovely. 
The spa didn’t entice us as you have to cross a car park, it’s in a different building. 
Breakfast was ok but no choice of breads, only sliced pan. 
Hotel was very busy but I wouldn’t be rushing back there. ",3,2019,02,17
218,Birthday treat stay,We had a fabulous overnight stay there netherworld hotel. We loved everything about it. We got an upgrade due to a phone call from our daughter. The staff were very friendly and helpful.It is a very comfortable hotel. ,5,2019,02,16
218,Breakfast was so disappointing.,Kilashee is a lovely place.  Lots of friendly staff. Lobby area cheerless. Fire not lit and it was cold. Bistro food nice and nice wine selection. Bedrooms big and spacious. Beds comfortable. Breakfast was so disappointing.  Bread selection awful. Cheap sliced bread. Very poor fruit choice. Very difficult to make healthy choice here. Staff very friendly people.,3,2019,02,16
218,Kilashee,"Rooms were spotless and comfortable. Food was very poor especially in bar,served gone off scrambled egg for breakfast.lots of staff but nobody seemed to know what to do., No atmosphere ,location good.A long way from four star.",2,2019,02,15
218,Overnight with concert,Really enjoyed our stay - an oasis of calm and comfort. Dinner and breakfast were delicious - great choice and friendly service. Lovely grounds/gardens to enjoy a walk.  Great venue for Christy Moore's concert which was so enjoyable.,5,2019,02,13
218,disappointed,draught in bedroom window had to keep curtains tightly  closed did not get good nights sleep. bar food not good menu needs more choices. hotel staff are excellent love the gardens  and the buildings  and the open fires ,3,2019,02,13
218,Amazing stay,"Our bed in room 146 was very squeaky which kept waking us up but other than that we both loved our stay, staff were really helpful and polite, the leisure center was so relaxing and enjoyed being down there on my own, i will 100% be back",5,2019,02,13
218,Afternoon tea,I met two of my dearest friends for a treat. The moment we arrived we were treated so well. The afternoon tea experience was very relaxing and indeed very tasty. The views of the gardens were amazing. All in all a lovely few hours far from the madding crowds.,5,2019,02,12
218,Afternoon Tea and Spa day,"Myself and 2of my friends booked afternoon tea and Indulgence package for Saturday 09th. From the moment we arrived we were treated fantastically. Afternoon tea was served and a lovely young man explained all that were on our plates. Food was amazing. Any amount of teas and coffees and nothing was too big a deal or fuss. Had a walk around the beautiful gardens and then over to the spa. Reception staff were lovely, showed us all around and explained the process in a clear and precise manner. The hydrothermal suite was delightful. So clean and relaxing. Then up to the spa rooms where we got use of the flotation bed(this was simply incredible). After half an hour a lovely therapist, cathriona, came and got me for back, head, neck and face treatment. She was brilliant, so lovely and easy going. Myself and my friends left Kilashee feeling a million dollars. A perfect day. We cannot wait to return. Thanks again so much to all your lovely staff. ",5,2019,02,12
218,Relaxing one night break,"We got a cancellation the day before so needless to say I was delighted, have stayed here before so I knew I would get to recharge my batteries. Great service, we dined in the bistro, went to a show in the hotel that night, it was most enjoyable, room was exactly as expected, bed is the most comfortable I’ve ever stayed in, shower was amazing, breakfast was great, service through the stay was excellent. Highly recommend for a night away to recharge batteries. Spa is also my favourite! ",5,2019,02,12
218,Fantastic Hotel,"Fabulous Hotel, stayed here many times over the years and never disappointed, the place just gets better and better. Staff are top class, so friendly and professional. We received a complimentary room upgrade as it was our Anniversary, a claasy gesture from the Killashee. ",5,2019,02,11
218,Last minute trio away,We booked Killashee on recommendation from a friend and we weren’t disappointed. The bed was fantastic.  The food was good.  The atmosphere and ambience were great.  The area is lovely close to naas Punchestown and Kildare . We will return ,5,2019,02,11
218,Poor,On arrival we waited 30 mins before our room was ready. I had to approach the front desk to ask if the room was ready. I got in between conversation the two staff members when j did inquire. God knows how long we would have been waiting if I didn't ask. Didntbget much comfort in the room. Next door had music very loud for a few hours. The hotel staff were very poor in dealing with the matter. Overall a poor experience. ,2,2019,02,10
218,Poor Service,"Be extremely careful if you have any allergies in this restaurant. They don’t take it seriously and are very rude if you complain. Also, in this hotel, be careful of your own properties. Housekeepers tend to throw away things you might actually need.",1,2019,02,08
218,Lovely weekend break,"Beautiful setting, lovely gardens and excellent rooms. Lots of nice areas to relax and enjoy a coffee or a drink, staff is friendly and helpful. I was a little disappointed with the bistro menu. Breakfast however was very good. A spa treatment is a must have!!",4,2019,01,31
218,Hen party to remember,"Avril has been wonderful and patience with me. I had organise a hen party for over 30 people. I was nervous about but Avril and other staffs has been wonderful and helped me to make this hen party a complete success. Bride to be want a luxury, yummy cocktails and amazing food. She said it had exceed her expectations. Best part it is very reasonable and affordable that the girls is planning a reunion next December. I would higher recommend for any of the maid of honour to give the bride to be a night to remember. ",5,2019,01,29
218,Poor luxury,"A wonderful hotel, the atmosphere and staff were amazing. Could not have asked for better.Bedroom was very spacious, afternoon tea was a wonderful experience. Well worth the visit, it was a pity it was only one night! ",5,2019,01,29
218,Lovely break,"Stayed just one night with a group of friends. A lovely, relaxing stay - rooms are large and very comfortable. The staff were great, nothing too much trouble and a fab meal in the restaurant...they were happy to switch out the vegetarian option to one from the Bistro which appealed more. Great breakfast, with lots of choices for every taste. Would have loved to have stayed longer.",5,2019,01,28
218,Our stay at Killashee Hotel & Spa,"My partner and I enjoyed a fabulous overnight stay for his birthday. When we arrived into our room we were greeted with a bottle of Prosecco which was pre-ordered along with a ‘Happy birthday’ decorated plates with sweet treats which was a lovely touch. The hotel is fabulous, very warming with gorgeous decor and staff were pleasant and attentive. We ate in the bistro twice and the food was absolutely gorgeous. We booked 3x 30 minute spa treatments however the first 2 treatment only last 40 minutes instead of 60. Breakfast was very nice, nicest we’ve had in a hotel in a long time. Overall a very enjoyable stay but feel a bit hard done by as the treatments were cut shorter than what we paid for. ",4,2019,01,27
218,Good relaxing break,Ideal for a wedding or relaxing break and great food the staff are very friendly and helpful even at night they are very accomadating and well managed .. the rooms are spotless and they have a large array of food,5,2019,01,22
218,Very enjoyable stay,We would have liked to stay longer.  We were very pleased to have been upgraded to a Suite on the occasion of my partner's birthday.  We hope to return again in the future.  We would recommend this hotel to our family and friends.,5,2019,01,17
218,Mixing teh bad with the good.,"At check-in, directed to a room a long way from reception - the structure of the Hotel resulted in having to take a lift up and a second separate lift down to get to the bedroom. Bedroom was in process of being painted with buckets, etc. all over teh room. Returned to Reception (no apology given) and directed to a second room - heat not on (it was January and window open). The Restaurant is the exact opposite - food was superb and staff very friendly",2,2019,01,17
218,A weekend of pampering at Killashee Hotel,"I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend at Killashee for a special birthday. From the moment we arrived to our departure, it was a relaxing, no fuss and enjoyable experience. I loved the gardens even in Winter. I can't wait to return to see them in the Summer. I would highly recommend a stay at Killashee Hotel.",5,2019,01,16
218,Nice characteristic hotel but expensive for dining,Pleasant surroundings but a bit limited & expensive for dinner menu. We found the hotel very warm which made it feel stuffy. The gym facilities are quite good and The hydrotherapy pool is a great place to unwind.,4,2019,01,15
218,Great stay.,Beautiful hotel. Gorgeous rooms. Comfortable bed. Tasty breakfast..Great selection. Lovely dinner in the bistro. Great service. We were celebrating a 50th and they couldn't have been more helpful with the cake and decorating the table.,5,2019,01,15
218,It was nice,Its a nice Hotel but it hasnt the wow factor you expect looking at the pictures. The staff are friendly. The hotel layout is a bit all over the place. you have to go up a floor to come down a floor to get to some of the bedrooms. The room was very clean and warm. The food was nice but I was at a wedding so I dont know what the menu is like normally or if its expensive or not. I paid 160 euro for a double room for one night and I felf it was a little over priced for what it was.,3,2019,01,08
218,Beautiful hotel!,"I really enjoyed my stay in Killashee hotel . The hotel is beautiful  and offering great facilities. Plenty of well trained, friendly staff catering well for their guests and it is makes  the whole experience extra special. I would definitely comeback  and would recommend this hotel to my friends  to visit. ",5,2019,01,08
218,Lovely period house hotel,"Lovely period house hotel. Easy check in with friendly staff. We were given a large clean twin bedroom with 2 double beds, good heating, ensuite had bath with overhead shower, which was difficult for me to use with a fractured foot. We would have liked a bathroom with a separate shower... staff at reception were aware that I was using crutches. Not sure if there is AC in bedrooms. Good breakfast served in the restaurant, but the bistro was part of a large open space which was noisy and part of the lounge/bar. Overall our stay was good and value for money.",4,2019,01,07
218,Last Night in Ireland,"Booked in at the last moment as I decided to stay in Kildare, where my family originated from. I struck the jackpot. The hotel and staff were welcoming and excellent. The room was large and extremely comfortable. Dinner and breakfast were more than satisfactory. All staff happy to serve you and help you out. The ground are worth a walk with some interesting areas, the hotels history is interesting and worth chasing up a bit on the internet besides the information in the entrance area.",5,2019,01,07
218,Wedding Guest,"Attended a family wedding on Saturday 29th December, first impressions was a beautiful hotel from the outside and the main reception.  Other than that the other areas were not so great the communal toilets weren’t very clean as the reception drinks afterwards the furniture was really poor quality split and grubby.  The dinner reception was lovely but was very late as we didn’t finish all courses until after 21:30 whether that was the wedding party choice or not? I’ve attended a lot of weddings and never have finished a wedding dinner this late.  Our bedroom decor was so out dated and the bathroom could do with a complete refurbishment for the price we were charged at €170.00 B&B  I would not rate this hotel at 4 stars as I’ve been to lower rated hotels before with much better quality/ value for money.  Considering this hotel hosted four weddings over this weekend that’s a lot of monies/profits, they could at least have cleaner reception/toilets areas and better accommodation facilities.",2,2019,01,04
218,really disappointed,"I stayed here new years day with my husband and 2 children 9 and 12 for 2 nights. We arrived early for lunch and were very impressed overall at that stage even thought the bar/bistro was crazy busy. Lunch was ok tasteless chowder, good turkey club, service was hit and miss as they were so busy. Afterwards we decided to go to the playground as our room wasn't ready, through the butterfly garden, which was littered with drinks and glasses from the wedding the night before. The playground was good except the zip-line is a bit of an accident waiting to happen (my son fell hard off it) as its so mucky and difficult to climb onto via a ramp with nothing to grip onto. There was broken glass around the playground. When we went to check in I pointed it out to our receptionist but it still hadn't been cleaned up by the time were leaving 2 days later. So then we finally found our room, this hotel is an absolute maze or rooms with really poor signage, the room 230 was fine 2 x doubles. Then came the joy of trying to find the leisure centre which to our delight was out a side door down slippy steps then across a carpark - in the rain. We had our hotel slippers on so they was great fun... Anyway having been told the pool was closing early at 6 were informed (it was now 4.50) it was closing at 5.30. Our kids were looking pretty disappointed but sure we said we'd go into the pool even for that small amount of time. Pool is nice, plenty of signage there!! But the changing rooms have a climate all of their own, when I came out my slippers were gone.... So had to get some new ones and a robe so I could run back in the rain to the room. Thank god I had a room card to get back into the main hotel as that would have been great fun, I just think it wouldn't do any harm to inform new clients of all of these little important details. Anyway we had dinner that evening in the bistro which by now was roasting and had the lights on full blast so not as cosy as earlier. Dinner was ok, very little choice. We retired to our room around 10 and we were met with a room which was roasting also. So we tried to turn off the heating, the window was already open, but to no avail, then we called reception who sent up a housekeeper who suggested a fan as the radiator wouldn't turn off, which I refused as it was only get hotter in the room, my 9 year old burned his leg on the radiator, it was that hot. So eventually reception suggested moving us to a room 2 doors up which was also warm but at least we could turn off the radiator. So we had to pack up and move everything including 2 children on our own into a better bigger room at 10.45pm. Breakfast next day was good. I had brought some wine from the night before to our room for the next evening, we had moved it but it disappeared from the second room. Reception had no joy finding it so they sent up a full new bottle. That's a nice touch except it shouldn't happened at all same as with the fiasco the night before. At no point did reception or a manager convey an apology to us. Then to dinner the next night apparently there were over 250 people staying that night and one barman on... we had thought Turners (apparently fab) may have been open but no, just the bright hot bistro again. We had a lovely waiter Jasper (I think) but we were shoved into a side room with no atmosphere, no music etc. So, we had a great night sleep that night, ok breakfast the next day and then left.... seriously disappointed and around €700 lighter. I might seem to be picking holes and really wanted/needed to enjoy this break but we didn't.",2,2019,01,04
218,Wonderful Wedding Stay,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at Killashee for my Brothers wedding. All I can say is wow. The staff were wonderful and in particular the Duty Manager Darren who could not have done any more for us – such wonderful service – nothing was too much trouble. 
They wedding was held in the Original House which is beautifully decorated and has plenty of character. Such a lovely wedding venue for an intimate wedding of up to 100 people. 
The food for the wedding was amazing and everything piping hot which was a lovely change to usual wedding banquets. There was a great selection at breakfast and the 3 course meal on day 2 was just a delicious as the first day. Compliments to the chef. 
Many thanks to Killashee for such a wonderful few days – looking forward to returning back for lunch or dinner over the next few weeks.",5,2019,01,04
218,Stunning Hotel,"First time visit-  guests at a wedding, won't be the last. Absolutely beautiful hotel- inside and out. Fantastic food, great selection. Really helpful and friendly staff - could not do enough for you .",5,2019,01,04
218,5***** - Wedding Of Our Dreams,"We had our Wedding in Killashee Hotel on New Years Eve 31/12/2018...In the Original House.We both could not recommend this hotel enough...it has EVERYTHING....the wedding co-ordinators Eilis and Natalie were amazing right throughout...quick speedy responses and always worked with us as opposed to against us...A++++ , the duty Manager Darren on the day and day after was immense...could not do enough for us, reassured us right throughout, was there to help with Everything on the day, even on the 2nd day he was there to ensure everything went perfectly!! the reception staff, reservation staff, table staff, bar staff always had a smile, were down to earth and ALWAYS helpful - Brilliant!! The 12 bedrooms in the Original house are fantastic, the house itself is the Perfect setting inside and out for a wedding!!! we had 90+ people and it was just the right size for an intimate setting!! The band sounded brilliant in the room aswell which kept everyone on the dance floor!! The food on both days was faultless....sirloin beef and sea bass for the wedding day and both were a resounding success with our guests!! Once we set foot in the hotel on the day the guys Darren and Natalie took all our anxiety away - we were so relaxed and enjoyed every minute - the butterfly gardens were the Perfect setting for stunning photos..... The Belling suite for our ceremony was just wonderful....Killashee we take our hats off to you and thank you so much for making our dream wedding come true - Thank You, Darren and Amanda- 5*****",5,2019,01,03
218,Spa and afternoon tea,"I visited the hotel on New Year’s Day for the afternoon tea and pamper package. It’s was lovely. All the staff were really nice. We got to enjoy an hour in the pool and jacuzzi and the relaxation suite before we got our treatments. I got my massage and facial from Jessica. She was lovely. I really enjoyed the experience and it was so relaxing. We then went for afternoon tea which was lovely. I can’t remember the ladys name that served us but she was great. She gave us a breakdown of all cakes and sandwiches and she made sure to check in on us. Overall, it was a great experience. ",4,2019,01,03
218,Wedding.,We stayed here for a family wedding on Sat 29th December. And what a venue. It is fabulous. The food was to die for and the staff were so quick and organised. Nobody was left waiting for any length of time. Really attentive and a credit to the hotel. Rooms are a bit of a walk but didn't really notice as there was so much to look at. Bed lovely and comfortable room quiet. Would highly recommend Kilashee for a wedding venue or a nice break away. Keep up the good work. ,5,2019,01,03
218,Winter wedding stay,"We stayed here for a wedding and it was lovely. Hotel is quite spread out, so it’s a bit of a trek but it’s a fab hotel overall. We had an executive suit which was very spacious. Bed wasn’t great though! The slightest movement was noisy and the mattress seemed to sag in the middle.",3,2019,01,02
218,Wedding,"The wedding was great that we attended purely because of the people , we had an issue with our door being open when we returned to the hotel room at night the hotel management did not want to deal with the issue and brushed me off ",2,2019,01,02
218,Room Upgrade,"This lovely hotel was booked as a treat towards the end of our country roads Ireland holiday. Upon check-in our room had been upgraded to an executive room, thank you!
Having spent two weeks staying in various pleasantly quiet B&B accommodation, our arrival here was like walking into a wall of noise as guests from a wedding mingled in the open spaces with the sound of chattering echoing loudly. What a disappointing welcome, not because it wasn't a lovely hotel but because it wasn't what I was expecting. We had dinner in the bistro where the food was delicious but was a rather noisy experience due to a large group sitting nearby.  All this however, just added to the wonderful idiosyncrasies of our experience in the beautiful country of Ireland.",4,2018,12,31
218,WINTER WEDDING BREAK.,"I recommend this hotel for its location, quality service and good food. The bills are above average but are good value. There is plenty to see and do and there is a deal of local history to discover. This is a unique hotel and well worth a visit.",4,2018,12,31
218,Loved every moment in Kilashee Hotel,Bistro manager impressed  me with his highly professional nonchalant  attitude. The restaurant service in the evening time and during breakfast was very friendly and smooth.  Spa experience was incredible. I probably had the best back massage ever! Our room was spacious and had the most beautiful views of the garden.I loved every moment in the Killashee hotel. Thank you so much ❤,5,2018,12,31
218,One night stay,Overall a nice hotel but let down by a few issues.The food at the breakfast buffet was cold and overcooked and if I returned to this hotel I would pick a room only rate.Staff were very friendly and efficient.,3,2018,12,31
218,We did not want to leave,"We had the most wonderful time whilst staying in the beautiful country house. From check in to transport arrangements to our departure, everything was just perfect. There is a delightful mix of old and new but complemented perfectly by excellence in every department. So looking forward to a return visit. ",5,2018,12,30
218,Very Good Family Break,"We liked this hotel. But a few things were a bit off. The hotel seemed excessively hot. So much so it was difficult to sleep at night. It was a little bit confusing getting around the hotel at first. A little hotel map would be handy. The pool was nice and ideal for family with young kids. The spa was excellent. The bistro food was decent and we went there twice. Our first morning the breakfast was ok, but food was in trays a while. The second morning we went earlier and food was fresher and nicer. ",4,2018,12,29
218,Spa Retreat ,"We have visited the spa 2 years in a row now and have been very impressed both times. The staff are always so attentive and the treatments run on time. Everything is always immaculate and although the therapists recommend products - it's not done 'salesy' in any manner. The thermal pool is very quaint and clean , I would personally avoid the main pool as I'm there to be relaxed and away from children for the day ! Would definitely recommend. ",5,2018,12,28
218,Terrible customer service,Recently made a trip to Killashee house very disappointed made feel extremely unwelcome by the staff. Had to ask to see the menus we were left sitting for 15 minutes no one came to take our order decided we were obviously not wanted here so left and will not be returning. Menu very dated with little choice,1,2018,12,27
218,Great vacation,"We booked in for 2 nights stay in the hotel and had a fantastic time. Great atmosphere, service was excellent. We really enjoyed our meal in the bistro, staff were very attentive and accommodating to all our dietary requirements. We will definitely be back next time we visit Ireland.",5,2018,12,23
218,Yuck,"Mildew in the shower. A foul mold smell and a bad attempt to cover it with air freshener, permeating the hallways. Lousy service in The bistro. And a long hike through a dated and dingy maze of dimly lit corridors to get to the room. Pass on this place.",1,2018,12,22
218,Such a mixed bag,"We wanted a hotel within an hour's travel from Dublin and so booked Killashee. We decided to book a treatment in the spa. Arrived Friday evening. Food in The Bistro was completely inedible. On the starters all we could Tate was salt. Main courses were equally disappointing. Husband had lamb shank that was tough and chewy, of course, completely covered in salt, I had sea bass and oh the salt! Skip forward to the spa on Saturday morning... Husband toddles off for his full body massage. I sit there and wait. And wait. Turns out my therapist hadn't shown up for work only no one thought to tell me until I'd waited 30 minutes... Eventually, after I enquire, someone takes me to a room ... She tells me to lie on the bed...it is literally covered in the previous encumbants make up!!!! Got dressed and left!!! Then tonight we had the absolute joy of dining in Turner's... Wow!!! The food!!! An absolute joy in the midst of an incredibly disappointing weekend. The rooms are fine, it's clean, the staff are both friendly and accommodating but I don't feel it's a four star..  3 at best.... ",3,2018,12,15
218,"Poor, disappointed","The hotel was cold, the rooms were cold, towels were hard, dining room untidy , generally the hotel could be fantastic but just not up to standard. The breakfast was cold , eggs seemed to be a week old",2,2018,12,12
218,Lacking atmosphere,"Large noisey cafe like restaurant for both lunch and dinner with a small choice of mains courses, only 6. Hotel doesnt cater for guests eating twice daily.  Bar is also in same room, open, very bright, no nice music, no fire on at seating in reception even in a cold day, just overall cold and uninviting. Could be so much better. Turners restaurant for breakfast was lovely, this unfortunately was closed Sunday night. Guests should have a choice of where to eat. Hotel should hire my expertise in venue improvement  ! ",3,2018,12,12
218,Wedding.,"We stayed at the Kilashee for a family wedding, externally it looks very impressive and continue inside including the bedrooms, the wedding and reception went very smoothly with excellent service and food, we never got a chance to use the Leisure Centre or Spa so can't comment on that, all staff were very good from reception to the bar staff etc, a taxi to Dublin airport is approx 90 euros and you're approx 2 miles from the town of NASS which has various bars and restaurants in you feel like a change of scenery. ",4,2018,12,11
218,Fabulous stay,"Couldn't fault it, everything from the room, the food, the staff, the location...everything was first class. The food at the breakfast the next day was either a la carte or off the buffet and was one of the best breakfasts I've had on a hotel stay. Would highly recommend this place. ",5,2018,12,11
218,Loved my visit there,Went there for a wedding and stayed overnight.  Two very enjoyable days in such a beautiful setting.  I'll be back as there was still a lot of the surroundings that I didn't see.  I visited the Butterfly Garden but was leaving early so I didn't get to see everything.  One of the best locations and places to stay.,5,2018,12,11
218,Liked it so much we booked it again ,"We stayed here this week and absolutely loved it. We had our 2 year old son and we stayed in room 324 and we’ve booked the same room again for 2 weeks time. The hotel is lovely, nice and big. Our 2 yr old was flat out running around. We didn’t have a chance to explore the hotel which is why we are going back. 
We are all looking forward to the swimming pool and going on adventures around the ground. ",5,2018,12,08
218,Lunch date,We arranged to meet in Killashee at 1.15 for lunch on Thurs 29th Nov.We we're promptly seated by a polite young waiter. We ordered soup and sandwiches along with Fish and chips at 1 20. There were only 12 patrons in the Bistro and 4 staff members. At 2.00 our food had not arrived. I informed the manager on duty that we had to be back at work at 2.30. He went straight into the kitchen to enquire but never reported back. He walked passed us on 3 separate occasions but never spoke to us. We got up from our table at 2.15 and informed him that we were leaving. He informed us that the food was on its way. We told him that we were going back to work. We were really disappointed with the whole experience. We were also very hungry as we headed back to work without lunch. An apology along with an explanation would have sufficed.,1,2018,12,05
218,Grand ,"Stayed here a few weeks ago. Came down for Saturday night with Dinner and spa next day. 

Spa was only ok. Staff nice. Dinner was nice breakfast was awful. Rooms were so dated and a bit grim. 

The hotel was very busy but staff friendly and was an enjoyable evening just a bit over priced for what you get. Needs a revamp. ",3,2018,11,30
218,Birthday break,Felt abit disappointed overall. For the cost of a night away including breakfast and dinner I expected more the breakfast was so much better than the dinner which was overcooked...crispy. dining area we were seatedsin the bistro was chilly. Offered complimentary tea/coffee but  would have preferred a meal not overcooked as it was hubby's birthday present. Girl serving table was very helpful and did all she could to deal with my complaint.,4,2018,11,29
218,Games weekend,"Stayed with family and friends for a games weekend. The service and the conference rooms are great, but there seems to be a drop in standards if maintenance. Some facilities around the pool were broken. I really didn't appreciate half the pool being taken over for aqua aerobics on Saturday morning which I would imagine is a peak use time for guests. Also I feel the hotel is lacking somewhere you can get a quick bite to eat and not pay full restaurant prices",3,2018,11,29
218,Wedding Guest - 2 Night Stay,Had a wonderful experience at Killashee Hotel. Stayed for 2 nights at a wedding. Staff and management were a credit to the hotel. They went above and beyond during our stay. Nothing was too much trouble. They really made the wedding stress free for the bride and groom.,5,2018,11,28
218,Killashee Hotel Stay,"We went on a Christmas shopping trip. We arrived late evening. If you didn’t have sat nav it would be difficult to find as there are no signs on the road! We had our meal there that evening which was good . The next morning we went to the pool which is a bit away from the hotel building, didn’t think I would need a coat to go to the pool! Pool and gym were excellent . Breakfast was good.",4,2018,11,28
218,Lovely hotel and grounds,"We arrived very late, but the lounge was still open for a late night drink. Breakfast buffet was lovely with the standard choices and Irish traditional choices as well. The grounds are beautiful with a playground for children. Nice large rooms and bathrooms, which is not common in Europe.",5,2018,11,28
218,Only wish we had booked in for a few nights,"Really lovely place. Food was excellent. really good feel to the place.
Booked in for one night on our way back from being up the North, but regret not booking in for an extra night, as we were a bit rushed to get home in the morning. Will definitely be looking to get back shortly for a few nights when we can",5,2018,11,22
218,Great country hotel,"Enjoyed a short break here whilst visiting Punchestown races.  Had an excellent stay.  Lovely rooms, friendly helpful staff, great food and facilities. Lovely leisure facilities and grounds, recommend that you book early for spa treatments as was busy. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a relaxing country break",5,2018,11,21
218,Spa Day,rooms very room and plenty of space for three of us who were sharing a room.  Location just outside Naas town but had that country feel to it.  Staff in the Spa treatment rooms and in the restaurant were very friendly.,5,2018,11,20
218,Super,Been there for a business convention and although I felt like being in a golden jail I have to admit that this place is very cool. The room was well furnished and the service just excellent. Couldn’t count all the bars inside the structure and the gym is perfect ,4,2018,11,16
218,Conference,"Attended a conference here last week and it was perfect from start to finish. The day went smoothly and Sinead was more than helpful during the day! The evening was fantastic and the manager, Darren, was so helpful, friendly and there for anything we needed. The rooms were cosy and warm and breakfast was yum! Overall brilliant day & night.",5,2018,11,14
218,Stunning Killashee,"Stayed solo Sunday night B and B. Very good rate for such a stunning location. Room was very spacious and I loved the central bright light - usually I find hotel rooms quite dark. Loved the layout of the bathroom, 2 taps and a proper plug with nice basin at good height - also liked the timber surrounds rather than white plastic. Great comfortable bed. Fabulous view of the garden from the window.
I did however find the Bistro lacked atmosphere and the food was disappointing, main course did not fill me up! Reception staff were lovely but reception area is a bit ""barn like"". Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would stay again. Very impressive place.",4,2018,11,13
218,Could be much better for this price and as 4*,"I stayed at Killashee Hotel for business reasons. The room was cosy although even with all lights turned on not too bright. Corridors at the hotel may be confusing in the beginning because of constantly changing floors or following never-ending corridors. The weakset point about the room is 2 taps in bathroom sink - so British although even staying in UK several times there was one tap. BMaybe the idea is to keep it old fashioned but how can I wash my hands, either in hot or cold water?Special attention for food: unfortunately second weakness of the hotel. Unseasoned soup, extremely hard to cut meat. ",4,2018,11,11
218,Naked and frustrated,"Hate leaving bad feedback but didn't have a great experience here. My room was dirty and worn out. A discarded cotton swab under the mirror had not been picked up from a previous traveller. Stayed only for one night, and when I woke up in the morning the shower would only produce hot water. Not the type of thing that can be rectified easily as I sat there naked and frustrated. Eventually I had a quick bath instead, but as I have a back problem this wasn't easy. When I complained at check-out a mild, unsympathetic apology was offered. Finally at breakfast had to pay 3.50 euros for a cappuccino, as a minimum this could have been complimentary as the breakfast lady was in the reception area and looked at me in disbelief when I reported the shower issue. Needless to say I will not return.
",1,2018,11,11
218,Lovely Hotel,"I have stayed at the Kilashee twice in Nov once for a conference and once for pleasure

Both times having my partner and 10 month old with me....

Our room on both occasions were huge my little one loved the space to roam around....

The beds are very comfortable although I am not a fan of the smaller pillows but they are ok

The food is delicious as well

The staff are so friendly and helpful on our stay this time we were late checking in and didn’t realize we needed to make reservation for the bistro but the staff were understanding and fitted us in quickly

Would definitely recommend and will be returning again.

It is a little expensive but you get what you pay for

Thank you for two wonderful stays",5,2018,11,11
218,My favourite ,"I stayed here one night to help celebrate my mum's 60th birthday.
This hotel is just stunning both inside and out. We were blown away by everything. The room is a good mix of old and new and we had a stunning view of the gardens outside. 
The restaurant was just fab we could not fault anything.
Breakfast is also worth getting up for with plenty of choice for everyone. 
I cannot recommend this hotel more  ",5,2018,11,11
218,Exceptional stay would highly recommend,"gorgeous hotel, staff were so friendly and professional, it was very clean and well maintained, we were upgraded to a suite to our surprise which was amazing, we will definitely be back again. overall a lovely hotel ",5,2018,11,10
218,Killashee house,First time to this beautiful old fashioned house  which has great character. Once u step inside it has a lovely open fire to welcome u  but sadly has a lot to be desired The bistro restaurant is very contemporary and has no warmth whatsoever the food is below average although they admitted this is midweek menu. There is some beautiful decor but it is mixed with some cheap crap   What a shame to lower the standard of a place with so much potential   With some new management this place has all it needs to be an exclusive retreat.,3,2018,11,09
218,Family break away,Nice ambient hotel in good proximity to town and local activities. Friendly staff and very good breakfast offered here. Young children are well catered for including games and walks around the grounds. ,3,2018,11,06
218,Disappointed didn’t live up to expectations ,"Was invited to small family wedding meal on Saturday last.
Really disappointed as I had such high expectations for Killashee Hotel. We felt we were very much a forgotten party. In the back of the hotel the room we were in was not warm and welcoming we had to walk down lots of cold corridors with no one else in this part of the building except workmen! Who throughout our meal could be heard using air guns and a consaw. Food was only average, choice was good but mains were cold when served at our table. No offer of Seconds or anyone coming to tables to ask if everything was ok. The. We were ushered into a snug which also was remote and cold.
Sorry not a nice experience for us should have been so much better.",2,2018,11,06
218,Great Value,"Stayed here in October for 1 night while working close by.
Room was extremely comfortable and very clean.

Breakfast was really nice with plenty to choose from (buffet).

Great value for the €100 bed and breakfast fee.",4,2018,11,06
218,Staff lacking and strange hotel layout,"Spa- separate builing , we waited 10 mins to sign in as spa lady was on a smoke break we could tell as she walked back in with her coat and the smell,€10 each for 1 hour, 1 hydro pool and a broken steam room which we were not told about but a sign saying ask staff to direct you to another steam room on the other side of the building, no staff to be found , ask the lady when leaving , you had to get dried and walk through a busy gym to use the steam room on the other side,

Bistro dinner service staff not the best got one order wrong and the other was a salmon pea concoction which was like a soup then we ordered drinks during our meal didnt get until 15 to 20 mins later after asking the staff for our drinks while paying the bill,they were sitting at the end of the bar the whole time no one had brought to us. 

Hotel has nice walks and garden areas and a lot of character , rooms were nice and shower was good also 

Overall lacking hotel but could be made into somthing special",1,2018,11,05
218,Poor service,Service in the restaurant was not very good. It was a bit casual and some food didn't arrive and then we were told sorry but kitchen is now closed. The staff at check in were not very friendly. I was so disappointed as I have stayed here many times.,3,2018,11,03
218,Birthday Celebration,"Firstly, I would like to highlight, I don't usually complain!!
Arrived after having booked a superior room, to find the room allocated had dirty carpert, walls filthy, unacceptable for paying extra for a superior room.  Contacted reception, who promptly upgraded us to a suite which was satisfactory.
Went to the Bistro Restaurant for birthday meal, DO NOT GO HERE FOR FOOD!!!!  I ordered filet of cod, which was meant to be served with baby potatoes and peas, please see picture attached.  The so called baby potatoes were like wedges, and black, the peas, well, it was more like pea soup as in picture!!  My partner ordered rib eye fillet steak, requested medium rare, and got what appeared to be sirloin and very tough.  Bistro restaurant impersonal, noisy, much like a canteen, absolutely no atmosphere.  Spend your money going elsewhere, very very disappointed.
We were so looking forward to this break, and have been so so disappointed.  We all work so hard for special breaks away, this hotel experience has ruined a special birthday.",1,2018,11,03
218,Family catch up,Nice hotel...staff very friendly. I ordered cod for dinner at a cost of 18.50..unfortunately while the cod was lovely..I was left hungry as it came with very little...if I wanted I could have got a side of veg or potatoes for an extra 4 Euro.We got 2 very small glasses of wine and a west coast cooler 20.20..my friend got a curry..no poppadoms or naan bread..I didn't find it good value for money.,3,2018,11,03
218,ALL ROUND GEM,"Great food, fab service,  beautiful property.  Food in the bistro was simply perfect. Would highly recommend. Only made better by the best massage ever from Mairead. That was as good as it gets!
Will back for sure.",5,2018,11,02
218,Lovely getaway,"We went for a weekend getaway. We booked afternoon tea, spa treatments and dinner, with breakfast in the morning. Afternoon tea was yummy. very happy with spa treatments. Dinner was good. We stayed in a suite which was massive, like a small apartment minus a kitchen. it was very comfortable. Breakfast was great too. Things to improve on: 1. Soft butter with afternoon tea. 2. The temperature knob in the shower was almost completely seized to the coldest setting, took a lot of effort to turn it to the heat. 3. My wife was slightly cold at dinner, turn on heating or close the large double doors. We would return in the future.",5,2018,10,31
218,David Connor,"terrific value for money , the hotel marries old world charm with very spacious rooms and we found our stay very relaxing indeed.The Spa experience was a very nice addition as was the leisure centre.We will definitely be back .",5,2018,10,31
218,excellent,"very relaxing , comfortable rooms, very clean, child friendly travel cot provided at no extra cost reception staff helpful, meal in bistro was lovely service was excellent reasonable priced, leisure facilities were excellent overall great experience",5,2018,10,30
218,Lovely lobby and grounds ,"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Well done! 
The lobby decor is very nice. It is more dated in the rest of the hotel, but large rooms and nice enough. Good place for a business meeting vs the office. 
Food was ok, not great. Same with the drinks. The gardens are very pretty. I walked into Naas twice. About 30 min walk on a path, not bad at all. 
Good value. 
This includes a gym across the parking lot. ",4,2018,10,29
218,Wedding to remember,We attended our sons wedding her last week and it was a place to remember. The food was excellent and they even catered for  our vegan needs putting on a delicious selection of starters mains and also desserts so everyone could delight in what was great cooking. The staff went out their way to ensure everyone had a great time and the service was above good. The old house was spectacular and really added to the wedding allowing for the ceremony and also the reception to be separate from the main hotel which made it more special. The rooms in the main house were very well appointed and again were all given over to the wedding guests. The grounds were magical with colours of every variety and very well kept.,5,2018,10,29
218,Nice enough ,"My wife and I stayed here recently. The hotel staff are exceptionally nice and so helpful. We went for a junior suite. I wouldn’t bother spending money for this, it was nice enough but nothing special to warrant the extra cost. The jacuzzi bath wasn’t great, and the TV was so small that it was difficult to see from the bed. Lying in the bath, I noticed the wallpaper in the bathroom was water marked...I think I would just describe the room as tired. It was obviously missing some lights, as there was one of the switches that didn’t turn anything on. You could either have it really bright or quite dark. We had dinner in the Bistro. It was nice food and we weren’t made to wait around for it which was nice. Breakfast was lovely, set in the nice restaurant area overlooking the gardens. We also went to the Hydrotherapy suite, which was lovely. 

All in all it was a lovely stay. The room was a let down, but it was tidy and clean so that’s the main thing!  ",4,2018,10,29
218,Beautiful place,"We stayed here for a few days visiting family in the area and couldn't have been more impressed, will definite stay here again.  Lovely big bedroom, great bar and restaurant, breakfast was fab.  Staff very friendly and attentive.  The gym and pool have to be the best we have ever experienced in a hotel and to be honest better than the gym we go to at home.  Loved this place.",5,2018,10,29
218,Interesting hotel,Visited recently on business. Loved the history of the hotel. The original features are stunning. The grounds are lovely. The staff are pleasant. We are in the bistro and the food was lovely. The rooms are large and comfortable. Definitely worth a visit. ,5,2018,10,27
218,Beautiful hotel ,This is a very big and beautiful hotel. Looks like a castle from the outside. It did used to be a house. You can still tour the house. Helpful front desk. Great restaurant and bar. Dinner was delicious. Nice large room. Well stocked. We didn’t get to use the spa because it closes early on Mondays and we didn’t arrive in time which was disappointing. It should stay open later. There is a large leisure center as well which is basically a gym. Not near town. Sort of in the middle of no where. We had our own car. Plenty of parking. Would have liked to stay longer but we flew out of Dublin the next morning. ,4,2018,10,25
218,Disappointed,"Spent 3nights in Killashee hotel 2weeks ago and was so disappointed.   It was such a let down.   The bedroom was lovely, large and very quite.   Lovely grounds.  Dinner was served in the bistro which was vast and impersonal with 3 television sets blaring.    The food was so bad we could not eat the dinner on one night.   To get to the spa you had to walk across a large car park to another complex.    Certainly not a 4*.   Will not be going back or recommending it.",3,2018,10,23
218,Beautiful grounds,"I recently stayed at the Killashee, the hotel and the grounds are beautiful. I really enjoyed walking around the fairy garden & butterfly garden. Even on a cold wet day is was still fantastic and would highly recommend going to explore. 
I have recommended a number of friends since returning to go and pay a visit. 
The live music in the bistro on Saturday night was incredible I absolutely loved the young lady singing, such a brilliant voice. 

However as the hotel is a four star hotel there was a few elements that did let down the hotel in my opinion.
One being the staff is very under trained. The bar boy hadn’t a notion about what glasses for what drink. 
The bistro staff where so lovely and kind however you could see they hadn’t been prepared for questions about the food. They had to revert back to ask managers and chefs on a number of occasions. Rather then being prepared and giving a brief when starting their shift. I felt the staff were actually embarrassed they didn’t know the information. But couldn’t deny how lovely and kind the young staff were.
I found the same again with the breakfast staff being very young and a lack of experience really came across. 
I did find that lack of experience on the staffs behalf did hinder my experience at the hotel. 
However aside from that I found the hotel beautiful and would love to visit again.",3,2018,10,23
218,Fantastic Staff and fab wedding venue!!,"I was bridesmaid at a wedding here last weekend and we an absolutely amazing time! I have always wanted to attend a wedding in Kilashee as being a local in the area I have always thought the grounds and hotel itself was beautiful. I used to work in the hotel industry as part of the events staff and when I do attend weddings I can sometimes have an over critical eye as I know what is expected. What has compelled me to write a review was down to their amazing staff!! I hope they appreciate them because my golly they went over and above for us! Tara at reception was a treat and the general manager made sure that all the bridesmaids and bride we settled ok, he even offered us some flip flogs for our poor aching feet and brought us out sandwiches while we were getting our photos! What a gent! We had the wonderful Cassie (apologies if the name is wrong!) who served us on the top table, she kept the wine glasses topped up and even went to the bar for the groomsmen to get them pints! The food was AMAZING! The beef! Wow! I am still dreaming of it, and what was even better was they staff came around with some of the fish leftovers so I was able to taste both. So so good! The only thing I would fault you on is the gravy, I think it was definitely burnt, or if you are putting something smoky in it, take it out. The bar staff that served the wedding were well capable to deal with the big crowd and had the criac with all the customers, but most of all I would like to thank the poor chap that had to deal with us in the snug resident’s bar! We got notions of ourselves and decided that we wanted to drink Red Breast 12 at 3am, the drink wasn't stocked in the bar but he immediately got another staff member to grab a bottle from the man bar. For the snug alone, I recommend everyone to have their wedding here! It is so cosy and quaint and you feel like you have gone to a completely new bar! The rooms were fabulous! Very big and spacey!",5,2018,10,23
218,A nice location close to Dublin,"A good locaion with nice surroundings,   Restaurant has excellent food.  Friendly staff.  It is spread out so you will do some walking .  It is a relaxing place and to be recommended.  Very good for business meetings also - small or not so small",4,2018,10,21
218,Disappointing stay.,"Booked five rooms for a family reunion at hotel. There were problems from the moment we arrived on checking in at reception. Special requests regarding rooms were ignored & a complete mix up over room allocation with one room requested to be near lift being allocated to another person. The receptionist was quite rude & incompetent when dealing with the mix up. We rang the hotel prior to our visit to book dinner for our group of nine guests. This booking was confirmed & we were told a note had been made of our request for a round table if possible. We had reason to ring the hotel next day regarding another matter to find there was no record of any booking for dinner and now the restaurant was fully booked. We were told by the duty manager we would now have to eat in the Bistro. We accepted this as we had no other option. However on arrival at the Bistro no booking existed. On inquiring we were then told our booking was now in the restaurant. The restaurant manager was a lovely lady who tried to make our visit to the enjoyable. We found the €10 surcharge for a steak to be extortionate. Yes ! under €5 is acceptable, but €10 ?? There were mix ups on individual bills on check out.
We accept mistakes happen but such a catalogue of mistakes is unacceptable and can ruin a special occasion.  

Suffice it to say we wouldn't stay at this hotel again. 
Had considered this hotel for a family wedding BUT on our recent experience that will not be an option. 
Staff need a serious amount of training in communicating & dealing with customers & we feel that this is a reflection on the hotel management.",1,2018,10,21
218,Relaxing spa day,"Apart from the very confusing booking process, we really enjoyed our spa break. The treatments were fab, therapists were lovely and the spa set up was phenomenally relaxing. The monthly special was great value and we left, after 3 hours, feeling like we'd had a mini-break. Will definitely be back.",4,2018,10,19
218,Wedding,Enjoyed our stay with family members and friends at the wedding of our niece.the service at the breakfast was excellent and I informed Calum that I would recommend him as the best Staff member during the evening. ,5,2018,10,16
218,Authentic Irish Luxury Hotel,We stayed here in early August and had an excellent stay. The hotel is a historic building which has been updated to have modern comfortable rooms. The grounds are beautifully manicured and well worth a walk to explore. ,5,2018,10,14
218,Attending a wedding ,"Killashee hotel upon arrival was amazing apperance wise,entering building was lovely,reception staff not very friendly nor warm wasnt greeted at all he just wanted  payment off us just doing he's job.
As for the wedding entered the room & wow the staff was now on ball the waiting staff(alot of male staff)especially done there job so well,patrick & cian are exceptional workers professional & nothing was a problwm for them,keep up great work lads.
As in previous  comments yes getting to  rooms is a major problem up &  down like a yoyo & not much help to guide us from staff,can imagine with wedding all so busy but still little help be nice.
Meal was fab couldn't fault that nor the bedrooms amazing,bed was to die for would love to stay again but hard to see the price in it which is such a pity really.ibalso asked girl @ desk could yiu hand my coat uo as we going for breakfast left hanger in car i couldnt face walk out back in so arrived back, coat left on my bag.Tara was no way helpful at all. A beautiful hotel but a few thkngs lacking suxh a pity as i heard the spa is amazing  didnt have time to avail of it.
That you K.hotel for a lovely bed & sleep.
Kind reagrds Monica Tynan on ",3,2018,10,14
218,Wedding,"Where to start? 

We got married on 14th of September, original date 03/08/18 due to unforeseen circumstances we had to reschedule. Kilashee wedding coordinators were extremely helpful thank you Eilis & Natalie, accommodated the new date for wedding without any hesitation. Due to last minute cancellation they did not charge guests for rooms cancelled due to situation, they provided an outstanding service on the day. Darren was amazing at his job- every bit of detail covered. Kids playroom available, people still talking about the food. Every little detail that I would never have thought of was done. Really could not recommend kilashee hotel enough. Honestly we were so happy, they took the stress from the whole day, we really had a fantastic wedding with both family,friends and fantastic staff.
We both really appreciate all your kindness and help.

Paul & Mags",5,2018,10,09
218,Delight of a hotel,It is not very often that I visit a hotel with so many good things to say about it. The Kilashee hotel is full of the nicest both in rec and diningroom ans bistro. My stay in this hotel was delightful except for the distance We had to travel to our room esp if aide by walking stick. To get to your bedroom is complicated enough but having to go up a lift and then down a lift and walk miles is a problem. I will return to this delightful hotel but will request a room near reception to avoid the walking,4,2018,10,09
218,The excellent Killashee experience,"I stayed at Killashee House for a few days as delegate in a conference. I was impressed of the beauty of the place when I arrived, and this positive first impression was strengthened when I entered the building. The professional and friendly service made these few days a unique experience.",5,2018,10,07
218,Lovely grounds.,"The best thing about the hotel is the grounds it is set in. It has lovely gardens and walks which lead over to a river and a (haunted) house and stables. There is also a graveyard to be found on the walk. We went over to the leisure centre but was disappointed it wasn't the swimming pool that was shown on the website. This swimming pool must be in the spa that you can only access if you are having treatments maybe. It was a trek to get to our room involving 2 lifts and lots of corridor walking. Layout was confusing, would have preferred to use stairs but couldn't see any and they weren't signposted, they would need to be as the hotel has a very confusing layout. Dinner and breakfast were very nice.",4,2018,10,05
218,Dinner Event,"Excellent service and good value. We had a family dinner to mark a special occasion and the service and food were very good -first class. We have used the Hotel before and would be more than happy to go there again. The kids loved the outdoor area, the butterfly garden and playground and of course the swimming",5,2018,10,04
218,Lovely weekend escape,"This hotel was recommended to me so we went with high expectations - it did not let us down.  Large grand busy hotel with spacious rooms which were clean and well equipped.  Food excellent, nice gardens & friendly/helpful staff. I will return to killashee again.",4,2018,10,02
218,Quiet and relaxing spa weekend,"Great location for shopping village at kildare, food drink and see service great . Spa lovely and staff very tentative room service excellent and breakfast very nice.  Hotel lovely and impressive size inside ",4,2018,10,02
218,Beautiful old world atmosphere,"I love the old world look and atmosphere of the Killashee; the beautiful gardens are very tranquil and the hotel is away from the road, being accessed by a lovely avenue.  I cannot wait to return, having stayed several times in the past. It looks absolutely gorgeous when decorated for Christmas.The food is of a very high standard; bedrooms very spacious and the suites are heavenly!",5,2018,10,01
218,Wedding stay,"nice hotel, but ridiculous layout. We were located on the first floor, but had to use the lift to the third floor. Then a walk down corridors to another lift which then took us back down to the first floor again to our room. The meal was average, meat quite tough, veg, luke warm. 170 euro was quite expensive for a three star hotel",3,2018,10,01
218,Our favorite hotel in Ireland,"This hotel is amazing.  We were told that this hotel was formerly a boys school.  It was an architectural beauty.  We got lost looking for our rooms, but it was such a joy no one minded.  The staircase to the upper floor is something you really don't see much in hotels, beautiful. I really wish we could have spent a week here just exploring the hotel.  The grounds were beautiful too, but we didn't have enough time to really enjoy them.   We had to leave incredibly early in the morning and the hotel staff packed us little ""breakfasts"" to go.  Overall the best stay of the entire trip.  Will return.",5,2018,09,29
218,Comfortable stay,"Killashee is a great hotel to stay in and has great pricing for the rooms. I have to travel a lot for work and was surprised and amazed by the quality of the hotel compared to the price paid for the stay. 

Dinner was delicious and breakfast was too. Very comfortable room and all the facilities were available. Will definitely return.",5,2018,09,27
218,Lovely relaxing break,"Had a lovely weekend, the hotel is amazing very impressive. The one man band on Saturday was excellent. We dined in dining room on Saturday but eat out of the bistro menu due to a private function. And eat in the bistro on Sunday with the same menu as the dining room was not open. This was disappointing as we would have liked to try the two menus.",5,2018,09,26
218,Elegant and clean hotel,"Beautiful hotel and setting. Clean, well run, all facilities and resources you'd want. Dinner was good. Lovely location. Spa is clean, warm and beautiful! Have stayed previously and will definitely return. ",5,2018,09,25
218,Wedding made very special,We were at a wedding at this hotel. The service throughout the weekend was exemplary and the food was fantastic. Big thank you to Roisin who looked after the wedding party so well.Highly recommended.,5,2018,09,25
218,"Quiet and excellent for sleep – most of the tourists got lost searching for their rooms,","This four star hotel and spa has a magnificent setting, in extensive gardens and parkland near Naas. There a longish approach avenue among extensive grounds and gardens. The hotel is situated in country house designed by Thomas Turner for the Moore family, descendants of the earls of Drogheda, back in 1861 - originally a Victorian Jacobean hunting lodge. The striking old house has a long history and quite easy to get lost inside in the maze of hallways.  The estate was bought in in 1927 by the La Sainte Union Nuns. a French order, with many houses in England also. Killashee House was sold to its current owners, Brehon Capital Partners, in 2014 for € 13 million, apparently. 

Most of the tourists got lost searching for their rooms, as the numbering system is not quite intuitive – the 3rd floor rooms include 101, 201, 305- but 209 is on the 4th by a backlift!  We found the rooms very quiet and excellent for sleep – the bath was difficult to negotiate – slippery and limited access due to a plate glass on the right half.  Breakfast was good with a wide choice and plentiful. We snacked in the bistro – the maitre  d'hôtel
 was a bit fussy. The leisure centre is a separate building out the back. We did not avail of the spa – some fellow guests complained of a lack of sauna. 

There were many wedding photos on display at Killashee so clearly it is a destination of choice for couples looking for their memorable location.",4,2018,09,23
218,Great hotel,"Great hotel, great restaurant and friendly staff. Rooms are a little awkward to get to. Spa is lovely with friendly staff, would recommend the back massage. Would definitely recommend this place for a short break.",4,2018,09,22
218,Very relaxing stay,Thoroughly enjoyed our break away at Killashee house hotel. It was a very warm and inviting hotel. Staff were very attentive. Food in the Bistro was lovely. Breakfast had plenty of choice. Rooms were spotless with all amenities.,5,2018,09,22
218,Recent business trip,"I stayed with them for an overnight this week...It is a lovely location and an impressive building...I had food on arrival and breakfast in the morning, both were very good...I did not get a chance to attend the leisure facility on this occasion unfortunately...The bedroom was very comfortable...I would stay again and would recommend it to others...",5,2018,09,20
218,Room for improvement,"Stayed for a family break with the grandchildre before term started, didn’t receive a very warm welcome initially on arrival but that improved when we eventually checked in. Dinner was included in the package the first night which was served in the restaurant as the Bistro was closed (which we weren’t made aware of when booking) the food was fairly average and we chose not to dine in on the second night, breakfast was ok, the restaurant and hotel in general is in need of a cash injection and upgrade, the rooms are large but the decor is worn and tired, the bathroom was tired and dated and the bed pillows need changing! The grandchildren enjoyed the fairy forest and butterfly trail and the playground though the 8 year old was disappointed with the prize for completing the fairy and butterfly quiz a lollipop didn’t really cut it with an 8 year old! Leisure facilities were handy and the girls enjoyed them the pool.",3,2018,09,19
218,Excellent,We had a lovely stay here - couldn't fault anything. Room was fabulous and staff are very friendlyWould highly recommend to people and will return for another stay soon. Really nice gardens to explore and also enjoyed reading up on the history of the buliding ,5,2018,09,19
218,Killashee Heaven,"Killashee Hotel was a beautiful and relaxing experience. 3 days of bliss. Big bedrooms bright and clean. Amazing food in the restaurant, lovely staff, so attentive, and relaxing Spa.I will definitely be back.",5,2018,09,18
218,STAYED FOR BUSINESS BUT WILL RETURN FOR PLEASURE,"we stayed in Killashee House Hotel on thursday 13/09/18.  From the moment we checked in the staff in the hotel were so lovely and really helpful,. Id highly recommend a stay here and will return for another stay!! ",5,2018,09,17
218,"Lovely hotel, enjoyable stay","We've stayed here a couple of times before and once again our stay this time was very pleasant. The hotel itself is beautiful with a nice feel to it. The staff on reception were lovely and very helpful and this was the same for staff throughout the hotel for the couple of days. 
We attended a wedding there and the food was excellent - possibly the best wedding food I've had so congrats to the catering team there.
Couple of small things which would have made our rating excellent instead of very good - It is a little pricey at €200 for the night and some of the items in the buffet breakfast did appear to have been served a lot earlier (though in fairness we were quite late to breakfast).
Overall though a very enjoyable experience and lovely hotel",4,2018,09,17
218,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel In a wonderful setting. Very family/ child friendly, staff were very helpful food was amazing, kids had a great time exploring and making use of the playroom great venue for a wedding overall had a great stay",5,2018,09,17
218,Very enjoyable night away,"Myself and my other half visited Killashee Hotel last Saturday night.we arrived and checked into our room.we had been upgraded to a suite which was an extra bonus!our suite was very spacious. Our large bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept well.
We enjoyed some cocktails in the bar as well as lunch. The service was good and staff were very friendly.
That evening we booked into Turner's Restaurant for a meal. Friends of ours joined us for the meal (another couple) 
The meal was lovely from start to finish as were the peach bellinis we had! Service in the restaurant was great all staff were very attentive. I advise eating in the restaurant the room itself is beautiful with a calm,old wordly atmosphere .
Breakfast which we both enjoyed the following morning which was served in the same room was cooked to order. A buffet breakfast also was available. Again service was excellent.
After checking out we used the hydro therapy suite which was lovely but not the best I've been to. 
All in all a lovely night's stay in the beautiful Killashee. We left feeling relaxed.",4,2018,09,16
218,Dissapointed ,"If you've stayed in really nice places you are likely to be dissapointed.  Place is can and staff friendly and responsive but facilities very over rated and not kept up.  Chairs in Turner Restaurant literally falling apart as we pointed one out to staff. But we saw a number of others on our way out. Breakfast nothing special,  typical fare but plenty of it and variety of food.  Bathtub slick as glass,  mat provided but don't get one foot off it. Wallpaper peeling in lifts and hotel difficult to navigate as so many sections added on. No washcloths! ",3,2018,09,15
218,Sorry we upgraded to a suite,The house and gardens are beautiful however we upgraded from a superior room to a suite and the windows would not open.  The room was very clammy and we had to use the 2 portable fans. We ate in the bistro which is a very big open hall with tiles on the floor.  It lacked atmosphere.  The food was very good and the service excellent.  the leisure centre is a separate building a bit of a walk out the back.  Pity is cant be accessed through the hotel.,3,2018,09,15
218,"Lovely staff, lovely setting","Stayed briefly on businesses. Rooms where well appointed and had a great nights sleep in a lovely bed with quality linen in aquiet room. Really enjoyed the pool/spa and the staff where very friendly. (Lovely check in experience from a very nice receptionist). 

Only complaint would be how far my room was from reception but on the flip side  i think that helped with how quiet the room was. ",4,2018,09,14
218,Could do better,"Average hotel with no great welcome upon arrival. We would expect either a doorman or attentive bell hop or preferably both for such hotel in the country charging almost Eur200 per night. Things improved after that. However, we did find empty glasses and bottles left uncollected around the hotel for more than one day.",3,2018,09,12
218,Fabulous weekend break,"A great find; this is a really lovely hotel, full of character with every facility you can think of.

The original house is beautiful with wonderful gardens.

The staff were all very helpful and attentive.

We will definitely be returning.",5,2018,09,10
218,Will return,"We stayed here for only one night and i was so impressed. Beautiful place and setting. The hotel was just stunning - decor was really classic. I had a pregnancy leg massage and it was amazing, Mairead was so helpful and made me feel so relaxed. The relaxation room was so lovely after. Went for a swim later which was lovely. We ate lunch and dinner in the bar and we could not get over the quality of the food - superb!!
Will definitely return!!",5,2018,09,10
218,Great for families ,We stayed in kilashee hotel on our way to Dublin. Great hotel for families....playroom...swimming pool....fab playground ....amazing walks. Dinner in bistro was ok ...not fab ...but fine. Hotel room lovely  as was breakfast in the morning.  Think it's a great hotel for families....particularly if you want to Dublin...red cow inn luas less than 30 mins away!,4,2018,09,09
218,spa break with friends,"Lovely spot not far from Dublin for a quick break. Spa lovely, room good quality, lovely old style furniture, really comfy bed, meals nice. Could do a little more to landscape the views outside the windows which can be a little functional. ",4,2018,09,06
218,Afternoon Tea,"Myself and some of my family went for afternoon tea to celebrate a birthday. All the staff were really lovely and helpful (particularly with accommodating a large party). I am Coeliac, so I can't eat gluten. Originally, I was afraid that there would be very few options for me, however I needn't have worried at all! I had my own stand which was filled with a variety of beautiful and delicious treats. They were also very careful about cross contamination, which was a huge relief. Many places don't have so much to offer for people with coeliac disease so I was very impressed. Everyone else thought their food looked and tasted great. The hotel itself is also very attractive. I would definitely go again and would recommend.",5,2018,09,05
218,our great family holiday,"we have stayed at the killashee a few times now and can not wait to go back. it is a great place for a family holiday. plenty to do with the great leisure centre  and beautiful gardens , our children really enjoyed the play park on the grounds. the breakfast was lovely plenty to choose from, the bar food was beautiful and worth a try. ",5,2018,09,03
218,Brilliant!,"The Spa, gardens and kids play park were our highlights. It suited our family break perfectly.  The rooms were a lovely size and every detail well thought out. The location is easy to get to. We will definitely return. ",5,2018,09,02
218,80th birthday party!,"We organised my father in laws 80th birthday here and really couldn’t fault the level of care we were given.  I always got a very speedy response to all my emails and the hotel itself is beautiful with fantastic gardens.   The staff were extremely attentive, helpful and friendly.   We had a really relaxed and happy day.  The children were free to explore the gardens and playground and avail of the swimming pool. The food and choices were of a high standard and our 9 year old said it was the best hotel he had ever stayed in!!!   Would definitely stay here again!  Well done Killashee hotel 👍",5,2018,09,01
218,Perfect Stay - I’ll be back! ,"Everything was perfect . Staff are all really friendly and attentive. Huge room with lots vent view . Ate in Turners restaurant - very good food and service . The spa was one of the best I’ve been to and exceptionally friendly staff. Lauren, the therapist, did a wonderful job. The grounds are so beautiful you could wander for hours.  Close to Kildare Shopping Village and Newbridge Silver - both about 20 minutes drive away . I’m already thinking of my next stay . ",5,2018,08,31
218,Wonderful experience,"Great stay in a beautiful hotel. Excellent dining experience. Staff were particularly tentative. Special credit to one of the night porters, Brendan. Extremely helpful and ever so friendly. Will definitely return.",5,2018,08,31
218,Exceptional staff,The staff were so helpful and friendly and are a credit to the hotel. Easy access to the motorway. Grounds beautiful and you can enjoy both a relaxing break as well as having activities to do for children,4,2018,08,28
218,Brilliant Experience,"We spent 2 nights here as a relaxing getaway. It was a fantastic break. We took a Junior suite, used the spa and ate in the Bistro and Turners Restaurant. There is nothing negative that I can say about the Hotel (The traffic from Dublin to Naas was the only downside and out of the control of the staff here I’m sure!!) The big breakfast and the bar food are worth the price alone.Staff, grounds, room, food (in particular) were all wonderful and we will definitely return early in 2019.",5,2018,08,28
218,A good location,"This hotel was a good price and an excellent location for a short break. The room was large. The bed was comfortable. The bed linen was not of a very high standard and there was a blood stain on the duvet. The bathroom was large but again cleanliness was an issue. The corner of the shower unit was not clean. The bistro was open for dinner, with a large tv on ! We were seated to the right as you entered so thankfully did not have vision of the tv. Dinner was not good...poor choice of cheap meats with a high premium for a steak. There was very limited and  choice for vegetarians. Service was adequate...it was a busy night. 
The grounds are beautiful and we enjoyed walking around the garden.",3,2018,08,28
218,Dated hotel made up for by the great staff,"We stayed here for a relaxing stay in the spa. The grounds were beautiful with plenty of walks and gardens for children and adults. We had the autumn indulgence package and got facials and back massages which were 10/10. The relaxation room upstairs is stunning and very tranquil, allowing complete relaxation. The leisure centre facilities were in need of some TLC however. The pool and shower areas had some rust/discoloration and the hot/cold shower experiences weren't working properly. The rooms were very old school with old furniture and bathrooms. Our TV was in a wardrobe and the tray to pull the TV to a position we could both see from our separate beds was broken so watching TV was difficult, with very few channels available. The bathroom/shower area was not up to 4* standard.The staff were faultless, always friendly and ready to help in any way they could. They made our stay very enjoyable. ",4,2018,08,28
218,Midweek deal with 2 kids,This is a very good hotel with excellent facilities for younger children. The grounds of hotel were great for kids while the Leisure centre was excellent. Staff were most helpful and friendly at all times. Meals in the Bistro was top class. Only drawback was bedroom was stuffy as no air conditioning. Overall great experience.,5,2018,08,27
218,Not as good as previous stay,"We stayed here for one night with our 2 children. The family room has loads of space. The grounds are lovely, the play ground is a great addition. Only let down of the stay was the bistro, we had dinner there as it was the only option on a Sunday night. The food was very basic, barely edible to be honest. One of the mains was forgotten and when I received it I was sorry I didn't leave it forgotten. It is a beautiful hotel but I won't be visiting again as it has gone way down from previous stays",3,2018,08,26
218,Two night stay,Fabulous hotel we really enjoyed staying with ye. The staff were lovely..... The hotel is huge and there is plenty to do. The gardens are stunning we could have walked around them all evening. Thanks to everyone. ,5,2018,08,26
218,Great stay!,Stayed here for one night with four children. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel and grounds lovely to explore. Fairy garden etc great fun. Pool a great hit too. All five of us were very happy :) Thanks Kilashee!,5,2018,08,26
218,2 night midweek stay.,Lovely grounds and the room was spotless. Food a bit overpriced. 17 Euro for either a curry or a burger and chips is too much. The lobby on our first day was full of business meetings with very little room for guests. The gallery was just as bad upstairs!! The grounds really redeem the hotel though. Fabulous walks.,3,2018,08,26
218,Can't wait to return,From start to finish the staff couldn't have done anymore to make the stay here better. Our room was luxurious . The grounds were perfect to walk off the beautiful food . Leisure centre and spa were just what was required to complete a memorable stay here. Easy to find and close to all road networks. Would highly recommend a visit. Very child friendly too.,5,2018,08,25
218,our family getaway to killashee house hotel,"safe hotel for children to play and roam around, good leisure facilities and food was excellent. Good family atmosphere and staff were more than helpful when it came to requests for extra biscuits and a cot bed.",5,2018,08,24
218,Nice but not Woow!!!,"Hi there my family and i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on the 21st of august 2018, the entrance to the hotel was very nice, clean gardens very well maintained. Check in was quite fast and the bedroom was very nice, clean and spacious. As a lot of people said in other comments we had to take 1 lift up and another 1 down to get to our room (217) which wasn't a problem for us our kids actually had great fun going up and down!! The hotel is very big and you can easily get lost but at the same time it is very nice, lovely gardens and a nice playground. We had an evening meal included in our package, we ate at the Bistro which was very pretty the kids had Tris of Melon, Chicken and chips, Bangers and mash and for dessert a cookie with ice cream (which was sent back because it was supposed to be chocolate ice cream not vanilla, it returned changed with the same cookie on. .....so drops of vanilla ice cream were on the chocolate ice cream) and a brownie with ice cream. In the complex the kids menu was very good. Us adults ordered salmon and mozzarella for starters, my husband said his mozzarella wasn't bad but my salmon didn't taste of anything. We then had pork loin with mash and beef and chips for main course which weren't too bad just the pork could of been more cooked it was a little bit pink....after that i had ice cream for dessert and my husband a selection of cheese. To drink we had 2 glasses each of El Camindor white and red. The second day we had  2 espressos for which we were charged  €7, i thought that was a bit too much, other drinks like pints of Guinness or Smithwicks were the same prices as in local pubs. The swimming pool was very nice with spacious an clean changing  rooms. To be honest in the complex its not bad but i think it is a little overcharged.....we paid €350 for 2 nights  (2 adults+2kids 5y and 3y) which was a special family package. The best things are probably the swimming pool and gardens the worst is the food at the Bistro,  i forgot to mention the breakfast was also included, it was a buffet of irish and continental breakfast, not too bad and you could eat all you wanted!

218,Great Family Hotel,"Had a two night break in Killashee House. Fantastic for kids with the playground, fairy trail and butterfly garden. The kids really enjoyed the treasure hunt activity. Great food and staff are lovely. Great pool. Would highly recommend",5,2018,08,23
218,You nailed it!,"This was our second stay at Killashee.  We first stayed here two years ago after flying in to Dublin and this was our first stop on our journey to the west coast and so when the chance arose, this was top of our list for a return visit.

The hotel is beautiful.  It’s a really grand old building which cleverly and deceptively hides a significant, indeed Tardis-like more modern extension, but it’s been well done and you’d never really notice or in all likelihood care.  

The common areas are smart but relaxed and this really sums up everything about this place; it is smart and tasteful and classy, but at the same time it is very relaxed and comfortable and you very much feel at home.

The bedrooms are huge.  We stayed in a family room and these are some of the largest we’ve seen in Ireland. This is a big plus point when you have children who need a bit of space in the hotel room.  And they provide two large double beds which are just perfect.

The only negative about the rooms is the lack of a mini-bar/ fridge (have they disappeared from all hotels in Ireland?) which is a shame as it’s so convenient to use for children’s drinks/milk etc.

We had hoped for dinner in Turners restaurant as we’d have a lovely meal and experience on our last visit, but we’re disappointed to find out that it is only open at weekends.   I don’t know the reason why, it may be the hotel feels that it’s not viable to run during the week but judging by the full room in the same restaurant at breakfast (which is very good) and the lack of competition locally, I would say that it’s a no-brainer and I really hope they consider opening it during the week in future.  We had dinner in the bar which was less formal. The food was good, but I really missed the ambience and the more sophisticated food we’d had before in the main restaurant.

Thank you Killashee. In the words of Mel B, “you nailed it!”",5,2018,08,23
218,Very Disappointed,"Stayed the start of August for the weekend. Paid for an upgrade to a suite, the first suite was so uninviting brown decor. Had asked for a four poster bed which was agreed before I upgraded and I complained got moved to another room but still no four poster bed. Sat night ordered hake and for a four star hotel the food was terrible, no flavour and undercooked. Emailed my complaints after I returned home and still no response. I would certainly not be recommending this hotel to anyone especially as it was not cheap for two night in a suite. In total €570 excluding the extras.",2,2018,08,20
218,Very pleasant,Lovely family stay. Lovely staff. Nice breakfast. Lovely gardens. Very good for families. Out kids could watch a dvd after dinner in the room. Rooms were clean. Great playground.  Over priced beverages however.Will be back  in the future. ,4,2018,08,18
218,Kilashee stay,"Our stay was nice, staff were friendly, food was good. Spa was very nice but found the hotel itself very disjointed. Outside our room was very noisy from early in the morning which made it difficult to relax ",3,2018,08,18
218,4* How? No atmosphere! ,"What you see on the website, is not what you see in reality!

This hotel really needs a good coat of paint.  Skirting, architraves, doors and walls all need to be painted. This hotel is very run down. Definitely not a 4* grade. 

Front desk staff have no personalities we were just handed our keys and told how to get to the lift. We were not given any shopping vouchers etc when asked if they had any maps of the grounds or the area they did not have any - not helpful at all. I think they need to go on a helpfulness and enthusiastic course. 

We ordered drinks from the bar to be brought out to the foyer this took 25 mins!!!

Menu for dinner very limited not a good variety.

Breakfast, very average staff again not very attentive. 

The grounds are beautiful and the swimming pool is a great size, these are the positives. 

Negatives, too many to list. 

We will not recommend this hotel and will not be back. 

This hotel could be great but sadly, staff and presentation have really let it down, instead it is shabby and dated. ",2,2018,08,17
218,Pricey but not worth it!,"The grounds are stunning and the reception and general guest areas are of a very high standard.

Check in was quick and efficient.

The Junior Suite we stayed in was cleanish.
It wasn’t to our taste. Very old and classic dark furniture.
The curtains were dusty and the bathroom had a few rails that were close to falling off.

I wouldn’t pay £160 ish per night for this place again. 

The room had no thermostat option and a guide read that if you require a heater please call reception.

218,My stay at Killashee.,"everything was just perfect. couldnt fault the hotel in any way.Staff, service, room, food. all were amazing.I will return again in the future and I will most certainly be recommending killashee to all.",5,2018,08,17
218,Excellent,"We stayed for 2 nights with a 7 month old. From start to finish it was an excellent stay. Although our baby was too small for many of the kids activities she was able to go on the swings and swim in the pool.  For older kids the playground was amazing and the butterfly garden was fab. Such great little ideas for kids...passports, colouring, fairy gardens.  Even tho kid friendly it was still fab for couples as the hotel is very impressive in general. In particular Naomi and Jason in reception were extremely helpful and friendly. Rooms were big and food was bery good. Will definitely go back.",5,2018,08,15
218,Lovely!,"I stayed here for two nights in July 2018.  I found this hotel absolutely delightful  Yes, it is slightly worn in places but I felt that this added to its charm!  Staff were extremely friendly.  Room was a great size.  I didn't eat dinner in the restaurant (preferring to out instead) but did have breakfast.  Good selection for breakfast and it is held in a beautiful grand old room.  The grounds to the hotel are beautiful and the setting is very peaceful.  All in all I found my stay here very good",4,2018,08,14
218,Family getaway,We stayed here last Saturday for my Mothers 70th Birthday. We arrived early on the Saturday to use the spa. Such a wonderful welcome from when we first arrived till we left on the Sunday. The Spa was fabulous with the treatments very relaxing. Our rooms were big with two double beds and very clean. We dined in the Bistro restaurant and everyone complimented how good the food was. Breakfast was lovely with a great selection. There was 10 of us in total with the staff making sure we all had a table together that morning. Overall a wonderful experience with amazing staff. We will be back.,5,2018,08,14
218,Perfect wedding venue,"We were here for a family wedding. Their attention to detail was amazing. They couldn’t do enough for us to make sure everything was perfect. The hotel has an olde world feel to it but with a modern twist, making the two blend perfectly. The grounds are beautiful for photo opportunities and the driveway is rather impressive to say the least.  Our room was spacious and perfect for us. We loved every minute of the weekend, surrounded by family in such a wonderful setting. Perfect!",5,2018,08,14
218,"Lovely hotel, loverly staff","Arrived at the hotel for a weekend with family, relations had flown in from UK to celebrate sister in laws birthday.Staff are energetic and helpful.Lovely gardens and grounds and a good Spa.Processes can hick-up due to the business at times of the hotel.",4,2018,08,14
218,Weddings,"Couldn’t find fault with anything. Very helpful and friendly staff who were a credit to the hotel. Such a relaxed atmosphere and everyone you met had a smile on their face. The weather was fantastic, rained all day on wedding day but we were inside ! Helped the horse racing which we enjoyed day after wedding. I have never seen Irish people so glad to see rain ! A perfect weekend in a perfect hotel. Will definitely be returning to this hotel.",5,2018,08,14
218,Killashee house,"Fabulous looking hotel, very easy to get lost going to the bedrooms and trying to get back to reception 
Food was excellent when it finally arrived-we sat for dinner at 7 and got our meal at 8.30 with lots of apologies and free dessert.
Swimming pool and gym are excellent and the grounds are very well maintained with fairy doors and fountains throughout",4,2018,08,13
218,Lovely Setting... Shame After That,"We sayed here for a couple of nights in August in a family room.

The grounds and the hotel itself are wonderful, it's a stunning old building with lots of atmosphere and character.  It really is lovely. 

However, despite the above, I do think it's a bit over-priced for a midweek family stay.
We paid £310 (sterling) for a two night midweek stay and it just felt a bit expensive for what we got.  I will elaborate later. 

There were plenty of positives and resulting tips from our stay:
• The gym is absolutely huge! (Not that I go on a family jolly and go to the gym, I walked past it on the way to the pool!)
• The pool is also large, (not the typical ""hotel pool"" that's the size of an glorified bath) this was a big bonus and I assume it's because the leisure complex is a standalone, purpose built unit.
• Changing room lockers are free, they require a padlock that is lent to you, along with towels when you go in.
• Parking is plentiful and free.
• You can borrow DVD's from reception for free - just make sure your room has a DVD player... ours didn't and they still suggested we take a DVD!
• Breakfast is very good, the Eggs Bemedict is excellent but when you order it, you only get half the muffin and one rasher of bacon... which just feels cheap and at £155 a night....

Despite the above positives, sadly I don't think we would return to the Killishee because:
• On check-in I was given no info at all, other than a key.
• A family room consists of two double beds as standard.  This is stupid.
• The beds weren't very comefortable, Premier Inn is better at a third of the price.  No amount of ""character"" can make up for this.
• The pillows were wafer thin (like a Spanish all inclusive) and there were no additional pillows available in the room. Not good for the price.  Not only that, one pillow was a massive square and the other was a normal rectangle.  Hardly practicle and very frustrating and a metafor for the whole hotel. ",4,2018,08,12
218,Simply amazing,"Stayed in this beautiful hotel for our anniversary. Just mentioned this when booking and we got an amazing Sophie suite and a dessert plate on arrival. All the staff is very nice, both reception and restaurant. Amazing grounds to walk around,peace and quiet.. would definitely book this amazing place again",5,2018,08,12
218,Upmarket food and room,Close to town of Wicklow. This classy old style hotel has lots of character.It is accessed via a long roadway. The staff are very pleasant and helpfull. Not overpriced especially midweek. Good self service breakfast.,5,2018,08,12
218,Not worth the money,Stayed here for a night to celebrate a birthday/anniversary. We were really impressed by the look of the hotel from the website and when we arrived to the hotel the grounds and the reception area lived up to this. However when we checked in and we’re given our room we were really disappointed how we were put so far away In an older run down building. Felt a little bit deceived by the website and we were expecting a lot more. Overall we were not very satisfied by our stay I wouldn’t return and if I had researched the hotel more I wouldnt have have booked it to begin with.,1,2018,08,12
218,Family stay Aug 2018,A magnificent building full of character. The grounds are excellently maintained. So peaceful and tranquil. Lots of free car parking on site. Excellent leisure facilities. Kids enjoyed pool and kids club. ,4,2018,08,12
218,Great hotel and facilities ,"Beautiful hotel and grounds. Great for families with activities. Our kids loved the butterfly garden, fairy garden and playground and the treasure hunts associated with them. Also they have a kids club in the summer months, our two youngest had a great time. Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice both buffet style and a la carte.  Staff were all very friendly and efficient . Would definitely come again and no hesitation recommending the hotel to anyone.",5,2018,08,11
218,Will return to kilashee,Could not find fault from arrival to departure. Friendly staff but efficient. Great size comfortable rooms. Lovely pool area. Great outdoor activities for the children. Very impressed with the fairy forest. ,5,2018,08,10
218,Wouldn't look forward to stay again,"Not too great a experience considering the price charged. No AC in the rooms, no proper bathrooms, TV in an awkward and inaccessible position, not too great a breakfast menu, again for the price charged, overall wouldn't even consider staying again.",2,2018,08,08
218,"Run down hotel rooms, not worth the price.","Stayed here on the bank holiday Sunday just gone to get a feel for the place in the hopes to book it for our wedding. Booked a superior king room and in comparison to other superior rooms we’ve booked in the past, this was not great. Thrown down the back of the hotel complex, we had to take stairs followed by a few minutes walking and more stairs to get to our room. Room had not been renovated in a while, old furniture, old hard mattress and old bathroom. We were very disappointed that we will not be looking to book our wedding here as the grounds are lovely but unfortunately the hotel itself does not match up.",1,2018,08,07
218,"Beautiful place, and meal","Had a lovely time. Think the hotel was recently renovated. Just a really nice atmosphere, with families and couples there. Did not stay there, just had a meal.  dinner was fantastic. Good vegetarian options.",5,2018,08,06
218,Beautiful place,"Myself and my husband spent one night here and I have to say it's a stunning place inside and out. Lovely room, I loved all the gardens outside and the butterfly garden is so lovely and peaceful. We were lucky it was a beautiful day and we sat outside and had a drink it was pure heaven looking around at the beautiful surroundings.  We had our lunch,dinner and breakfast there and food was lovely. Staff very friendly and helpful. We definitely will be back. P.s. lovely playground if you are bringing kids.❤😁😊",4,2018,08,06
218,Perfect for R&R,"Barely half an hour from Dublin, we enjoyed a brief but relaxing staff - making use of the sauna, jacuzzi, restaurant and bar. We had an all inclusive deal for a three course dinner, one nights stay, and breakfast. Well worth it! The main part of the hotel has a nice country house feel, and rooms are modern and spacious. Would be nice if it had a small cosy bar but that’s only a minor quibble!",5,2018,08,06
218,Lovely romantic place,"A delightful hotel away from the city with lovely gardens all around to walk in. The food in both the Turner restaurant and bistro were good and the staff were extremely friendly. We made a trip to the pa and had the Indulgence Package which was excellent. We were here for a Saturday to Monday getaway. The weekend was absolutely flawless but I'd think twice before coming on a weekday again. 

On the Monday morning, the cleaning staff were extremely loud from about 8.30am and knocked on our door at 9am for housekeeping. We said no thank you but they continued to be very loud outside our room talking to eachother while cleaning the other rooms. 

Other than that, the stay was perfect and I'd definitely come back on a weekend!",4,2018,08,06
218,Beautiful and relaxing.,"As close as it gets to living in a castle. A fantastic main building and a beautiful park surrounding it. The kids loved the Butterfly Garden and the Fairy Forest. I'd say it's perfect for kids.
Also great food and a good selection of breakfast yummies.",4,2018,08,05
218,Stunning Killashee Hotel,Staying at the Killashee was a real treat. The hotel and grounds were just stunning. The staff was warm and welcoming. Highly recommend afternoon tea and the breakfast buffet! We were impressed with our stay!,5,2018,08,05
218,"Beautiful outside, awful inside. Will never stay again !","We stayed at this 'hotel' for 3 nights on our Honeymoon with 2 of our children. Despite knowing that it was our Honeymoon, there was no reference to it, let alone any of the extra touches you would expect with it, being a special occasion. The hotel is very run down and we found the staff unwelcoming and less than unfriendly. The dust in our room is something that I've never encountered before at any hotel - I will attach a photo. Breakfast is standard, what you would normally expect and the restaurant is average but overpriced. Gardens are beautiful, and are basically the only thing good about the whole place. Do not book if you're looking for a luxurious stay ! Would not even give a 3 star,let alone a 4 star !!!",1,2018,08,02
218,Excellent ,"Fantastic first time stay at Killashee. The most beautiful suite ( room 184 ""Pipers Hill) Lovely dinner in the Bistro, and lovely breakfast too. The hotel also has lovely grounds for a walk. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to return!",5,2018,08,01
218,Nice stay,"Hotel was nice. Staff very good. Bed not comfortable, matress probably needs renewing. Food good...ate in restaurant. Breakfast fine, good selection. Stayed for one night, if my bed was more comfortable i'd have happily stayed another night. ",4,2018,07,31
218,Disappointing on all fronts.,Spent 1 nite at end of July with my family. Decor faded. No atmosphere. Had dinner in the bistro which was mediocre and overpriced.20 minute queue for breakfast which was definitely not worth the wait. ,1,2018,07,31
218,Great wedding venue,"Came here for a friends wedding. The place was beautiful, the staff were accommodating and friendly and the room I booked was massive and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was extensive and filling. Overall nothing but positives about the whole place. ",5,2018,07,30
218,A wonderful retreat from reality,"Beautiful hotel, spacious loads of character with a modern twist in bar area...very spacious and clean rooms, staff are very friendly and helpful..I would have no hesitation staying here again...Grounds of property very beautiful and they have a wonderful playground for the children...Loved being in this hotel one of the better ones...",5,2018,07,29
218,Always Excellent ,"My wife and I stayed two nights this week with our daughter, son in law and two children (9 & 2) - can't recommend the hotel and staff highly enough. We've stayed a few times as its really handy for a bit of outlet shopping at Kildare. Every stay has been pleasurable and without any problems. ",5,2018,07,27
218,Fine - probably very good for weddings,"Stayed here for three nights in June for business. The place is an absolute maze and it feels like you need a map to get to your room the first time (it is nicely converted from what was a school, having originally been a stately home).  The rooms are a decent size and well equipped. Some of the larger reception rooms are lovely and the lobby is nice and grand. The grounds are also quite nice and clearly designed for wedding photography. The food is quite decent, but a little overpriced and the bar prices are a little high too. I'd imagine this is a great place for a large function but overall l found it to be a little soulless and lacking in genuine warmth or that spark that would have you coming back.",3,2018,07,25
218,Easily recommend,Stayed at the hotel for a family wedding. The staff were very helpful from reception staff to waiters and waitresses. The food at the wedding and the following mornings breakfast was very good with plenty of choices for the breakfast.,5,2018,07,24
218,Excellent stay,"We have just spent a week at this hotel. Excellent customer service and it is at a good location after our opinion. It was close to alla the things we wanted to see and easy access to busses if you want to go to Dublin

Would come again anytime.",5,2018,07,23
218,Weeding celebration.,"Here you can take every thing slowly, enjoy good food and have a good drink in the bar. The staff is very kindly and help you if you need it. This hotel is rely a place to visit! And the garden is also something you have to look at.   ",5,2018,07,23
218,Setting the standard for Afternoon Tea,"My boyfriend and I knew we would be in the area for an activity so we decided to make a day of it. I booked afternoon tea only a day or so in advance. 
I was so excited as although I am a huge foodie and love to try new restaurants and foods, I had never officially had a sit down afternoon tea. I opted for the prosecco version which cost 32.50. Without this a regular afternoon tea costs 27.50.
We were not disappointed (well maybe slightly as there were no macaroons ;) ).
The location was turners restaurant of the hotel. The room was grand, with high walls and ceilings, high windows allowing great light into the room, beautiful artwork and furniture, a grand piano, and a lovely garden to gaze out into.  
The staff were so professional yet so friendly and even offered to take our picture. 
The food was gorgeous especially the coronation chicken, the freshly made warm scones and the deserts. It felt like a true occasion.
We really had such a great time it felt so grand yet so relaxed. I have since been to Afternoon Tea in other country houses around Ireland and they have not yet lived up to the standard of Killashee. Really enjoyable.",5,2018,07,23
218,Beautiful facade soon,"The exterior of the hotel is very beautiful. The bar is nice and modern, the beer garden is great and the lobby is pretty. 

The hotel is very big - there is an older part and a newer part and finding your way around can be complicated. The room wasn't great. For €190 per night I expected a lot more to be honest. There was The walls in the bedroom desperately need to be painted - they were filthy.
The bathroom floor was tiled in black and white tiles and it just looked and felt dirty. The tiles are broken on
Places The corners in the showers were dirty - its obvious that the housekeeping staff don't know how to get scum out 

Beautiful facad not enough for what is a scruffy place rooms very hard to access them no air con no fan in room",2,2018,07,22
218,My nephews wedding,Stayed here 3 nights this weekend for a fabulous wedding lovely venue very spacious bedroom's fabulous staff and great overall would love to go again if I could afford it well done everyone involved great wedding venue rooms so quiet at night comfy beds just fix the lift bit dangerous especially for kids and elderly ,5,2018,07,22
218,Left a little disappointed given the cost,"Decided to splurge on our first night in Ireland. Took quiet some time to locate with two phones and an iPad giving different instructions on where to go. On arrival the receptionist was excellent and well prepared and check in was completed in very quick time. Finding our room which was in another building wing down the back was almost an exercise in navigation as well and quiet some walk with luggage in tow.
Rooms are large by today's standard, high ceilings and old style fitting the premises.
Bathrooms have been modernised but with showers over the bath and they leak over the bathroom floor which is annoying.
We had dinner in the restaurant and both meals were very good as was the wine list.
Service was good but not exceptional with quiet a wait till our order was taken and again when attempting to get more drinks but the delay was not excessive.
Breakfast in the morning was a bit disappointing with the cheese looking like it had been there for some days and uninviting. Few eating there when we were present but attracting service at breakfast was more difficult than it ought be.
Good range of other options although not as good as I would expect of a four star hotel at this price range.
The gardens outside are magnificent and well worth a look as is the old Nuns cemetery at the back of the property.
Not sure about the pool and spa which we didn't use.
",3,2018,07,22
218,Superb hotel,"We had a wonderful stay in Killashee. The welcome was so warm on arrival & throughout our stay. Our room was extremely comfortable, with a lovely shower, and very spacious and comfortable bed. For those who don’t know it, Killashee is a large old period building, with spread out rooms, and is nice and cool despite the warmer weather we’ve been having (air con wouldn’t be needed). Our dinner in Turners was absolutely amazing. Scallops so sweet, succulent duck and steak. The chocolate creme brûlée was one of the nicest deserts I’ve ever had. Had a couple of lovely drinks in the snug after dinner. Followed by an amazing sleep in the lovely quiet room. Leisure centre is nice and had a relaxing swim before breakfast. Would highly rate this beautiful hotel. Look forward to our next stay. ",5,2018,07,22
218,leisure received with pleasure,"our stay at Killashee was a pleasurable experience from our arrival to departure. superb setting, lovely grounds and a great location to stay for visiting nearby tourist attractions. staff very friendly, hotel immaculate, bistro served excellent food and staff very accommodating towards special dietary needs. breakfast was so filling very little needed for rest of day. thankyou to all!",5,2018,07,21
218,superb clean and relaxing,"This hotel is one of the best if not the best in the country. It caters for all guests singles, couples, families young or old.  It is a exceptionally clean and spacious yet tranquil hotel.  Amazing gardens and walks-+ a butterfly garden which my 2 year old daughter would have stayed in all day.  There is a lovely playground with rabbits and squirrels which is all shaded with hugh beautiful trees.
 The food is tasty which you don't get in many hotels if any at this stage! 
Bedrooms are spacious and clean with the most comfortable beds.

Compliments to management staff throughout this hotel.",5,2018,07,21
218,Its ok,"Booked the spa package for me & my best friend. Location was easy to find with Google
Map. Beautiful building . The spa is in a separate building ( which we did not know ) & have to walk over , its not far , about 5 minutes walk but when we didnt know and had to walk back as we forgot to bring our swimsuits it can be annoying. The spa service is good, nothing spectacular. Good value. We also had dinner booked at Turner’s restaurant, it was ok. Staff was lovely and very attentive. There was a wedding on, but the noise from the party stopped around midnight. It was a very warm night and we rang twice to request for a fan, which was answered and we were told it would be send up, but unfortunately never did ( until the morning). Its better if it was said a fan was not available than for us to be kept waiting and gave up in the end. Overall the package deal was good value ( overnight, spa & dinner). ",3,2018,07,21
218,Mediocre,Had a  meal in the Bistro Restaurant for a special occasion. The food was very average and was lukewarm when served. Very overpriced for what it was.Had previously visited in early June and was so impressed that I specifically booked this restaurant for this special occasion. Left disappointed and won't be returning anytime in the near future.,2,2018,07,20
218,Very comfortable ,"The Killashee Hotel is a large hotel on the outskirts of Naas.
The rooms are a very good size, quiet and with comfortable beds. The bathroom was also large with a decent shower.
I didn’t eat dinner but breakfast, whilst being a buffet, was excellent and the bar facilities were perfectly adequate with a reasonable selection of drinks.
Also, compared to central Dublin, rates are excellent but, whilst transfer to the airport only takes 45-60 minutes, it costs c.€80 on account of the distance.
The only downside was my room was a long walk from reception...downstairs, along corridors, down more lifts and along more corridors...but I guess this did contribute to it being quiet!
",4,2018,07,19
218,Nathan Carter Night,"Visited with my daughter and two special needs grandchildren 9 and 8. Impressive staff friendly visiting for Nathan Carter Night for my daughter's birthday. Had booked for lunch nice meal for everyone. Only disappointment in dessert my daughter had was a hair, which was quickly replaced! Lovely grounds to explore. Only other thing bit disappointed with two children sitting on sofa near reception whilst Mammy checking out my Grandaughter was tickling her brother not noisy either and a member of staff told her off for messing in the hotel? I think if she had something to say should have been to Mammy. Also my Grandaughter has asperger and this upset her tremendously. So our visit did not have a good end.",3,2018,07,18
218,Wedding,"Absolutely fantastic. Staff are all wonderful. Hotel is beautiful, spotlessly clean. The food is magnificent. There is nothing to fault in the Killashee Hotel. An absolutely terrific time from start to finish.",5,2018,07,17
218,Excellent Hotel - beautiful surroundings and setting,"Lovely hotel, very spacious rooms, food in Bistro was excellent - wonderful sized portions.   Leisure facilities did not open until 8.30 which was disappointing but the surroundings of the hotel and its gardens are amazing!",5,2018,07,16
218,Wonderful beacon of light after a long day.,Kilashee is located in a a wonderful area and has superb little grounds and walks for all. The hotel is old quaint but modern. Its open and spacious with very helpful staff. The rooms are large and very adequate and well furnished. I believe that new carpets and curtains are being installed in the bedrooms. This works has yet to be completed. Enjoyed the Bar food but I would prefer if staff did a check of the floors as there were remnants of food on the floor where I and my wife sat. Prices were reasonable but on the pricey side if you enjoyed a beverage. Lovely setting for all occasions.,4,2018,07,15
218,I need of some TLC,"Pretty disappointed with this, especially given the €180/night price tag. 
Firstly, the trek to our hotel room (with two infants in tow) was verging on farcical: up one lift; a walk down a lengthy corridor; down another lift; another walk down an even lengthier corridor. In all, a good five/six minute hike from reception to our room. 
En route, we were gazed down upon by some very tired and faded artwork. 

We then paid a visit to the “playroom”. This was a tiny room containing a few blocks, a dolls’ house (with no dolls) and some other miscellaneous hand-me-downs. Kids were very underwhelmed. 
This said, there was a decent playground in the grounds, and a fairy hunt for them to get stuck into. 

Our room itself was in need of some TLC - particularly the bathroom (the door had to be forced shut and the bath/shower was showing its age). 
Worst of all, though, was the lack of any sort of temperature control, which I have come to expect as standard in any decent hotel room. Despite only being in the low teens that night outside, the room was as uncomfortably warm, with he window open. Very stuffy. 

Breakfast was a little above average, with all the standard fare and no more. 

In summary, very, very average for the price paid",2,2018,07,13
218,Beautiful gardens.,"I stayed here for 3 nights for a wedding at the beginning of June 2018. The exterior of the hotel is very beautiful. The bar is nice and modern, the beer garden is great and the lobby is nice. The reception staff were nice and friendly.
We ate in the bar/restaurant on the first night. The food was mediocre and the menu was very limited.
The hotel is very big - there is an older part and a newer part and finding your way around can be complicated. Ask for a room in the newer part. We, unfortunately, stayed in the older part. The room wasn't great. For €190 per night I expected a lot more to be honest. I dropped an earring and had to retrieve it from under the bedside locker. There was an incredible amount of dust underneath - big clumps of it. It was disgusting. The walls in the bedroom desperately need to be painted - they were filthy.
The bathroom floor was tiled in black and white tiles and it just looked and felt dirty. The corners in the showers were dirty - its obvious that the housekeeping staff don't know how to get scum and body fat out of the corners. (Tip: a toothbrush and some bleach). 
The room was basically just grubby. Then on the morning after the wedding someone was outside the room cutting the hedges with an incredibly loud hedge trimmer at 8am... I was incredulous. Other guests complained to reception. I was shocked at the incompetence shown by management who allowed routine maintenance to commence at such a ridiculous hour on a Saturday morning.
The room for the wedding ceremony was pretty. 
The room for the wedding reception was nice enough. The layout of the tables wasn't great and the room seemed too big for the amount of guests (around 100). I think the wedding planner at the hotel should have mentioned to the bride and groom that the room would look quite empty if they had a 'small' guest list.
The wedding food was nice enough but I expected better to be honest. 

I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my friends or family because although it is pretty in the common areas and the gardens are wonderful the rooms and bar food are such a let down. Its so over-priced. Very disappointing.",2,2018,07,11
218,amazing relaxing,I went with my mam and sister for my mams 60th we had afternoon tea which was fab .. staff so friendly couldn't do enough .. room was amazing beds so comfy . can't wait to go back .. the gardens are fab and so peaceful .. food was lovely also ,5,2018,07,11
218,Hot and Bothered in the Castle,Spent 3 hot and miserable nights at the Killashee Hotel - never again! The lobby and function rooms are OK although very hot. The bedrooms are blah and hot. No AC. Amenities nonexistent. Would not reccomend.,2,2018,07,10
218,Light lunch,A lovely light lunch in beautiful surroundings. We ordered a goats cheese dish 8.50€ and fish cakes 9.00€ with a side order of French fries 4.00€.Tea for two cost 3.0€. Total cost 24.50. The goats cheese was on a biscuit and had figs and salad leaves with a balsamic dressing. The two fish cakes were served with salad leaves and a balsamic dressing. Staff were atttentive and friendly. There was no rush on us to finish our meal. Definitely a lovely venue for a catch up with a friend.,5,2018,07,09
218,Beautiful Hotel and Gardens,"We had a lovely stay in Killashee,very relaxing and tranquil. The room was good particularly the bathroom, it seemed to have been newly renovated. The facilities in the room were generally good, there was no air-conditioning or fridge, which is standard in most hotel rooms nowadays. The weather was glorious so we were able to enjoy the beautiful gardens. The evening meal was very good and although my husband enjoyed the buffet breakfast I opted for the Eggs Royale and unfortunately the poached eggs were overcooked.  ",5,2018,07,09
218,Killashee house hotel stay,"Excellent hotel, facilities, food and staff. i would definitely recommend this for both business or leisure stay and events. the hotel is located just outside Naas town which is a great place to visit at the weekends. ",5,2018,07,09
218,Relaxing,A great location with great staff.  Beautiful building with lovely gardens.  A great location for exploring further afield in Ireland. The town of Nass is big enough to provide for a variety of eating and drinking options without the hustle and bustle of Dublin which is only a short drive away.,5,2018,07,08
218,Wedding,"Recent attended a wedding, from the moment we walked in thr door till we left everything was outstanding...in particular one member of management Darren went out of his way to make sure all was perfect ",5,2018,07,04
218,Great hotel,Excellent food and breakfast.rooms are good but personally prefer modern room. Beds are very comfy. Plenty of parking. Staff are helpful. Lovely walks around the grounds. Would recommend a stay in the hotel.,4,2018,07,03
218,Killashee Hotel,Beautiful Hotel with amazing grounds. So relaxing it felt like you were in another world away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  It was very easy to get there.  Staff were extremely helpful.   We definitely be returning.,5,2018,07,03
218,Stunning hotel,"We had a fabulous girls day out at Killashee Spa, followed by dinner and then evening entertainment in the hotel. I went with my sister and we loved every minute. We stayed in a fabulous room which had 2 double beds. Total comfort. Staff were friendly, courteous, professional and fun. I would absolutely recommend... Go and enjoy this wonderful Irish hotel. ",5,2018,07,03
218,Disappointing,The facilities for the wedding we attended were excellent. However the room was not. Tea/coffee facilities in room (144) were not there even though advertised. Also at the price I would normally expect at least slippers to be supplied and probably a robe too. The bathroom floor was not clean and the shower had quite a lot of mould around the bottom. Water from taps was initially brown but did clear after running for a while.,3,2018,07,02
218,Excellent staff,"Beautiful hotel surroundings and very helpful staff who were able to quickly resolve a noise issue affecting our room. Hotel is popular for the likes of weddings due to it being very picturesque so it can be busy with guests, though it has many areas within the grounds that offer peace and quiet too.
Close to Naas racecourse (and others too) and Kildare Village shopping outlets which were the reasons we were in the area.",4,2018,07,01
218,Christening ,"Fantastic Hotel 
Staff professional and friendly 
Food top quality 
Jacks Bar was our venue area 
There was a wedding party there too 
But we were never left unattended
Stayed there aswell 
Rooms were beautiful we had a Junior Suite 
Well done to Management and Staff ",5,2018,06,30
218,Killashee House stay,I stayed in killashee house recently as a tour guide with 26 passengers they all enjoyed it immensely not1 single complaint 4 of them stayed back from a day trip to Dublin to enjoy the spa and other facilities at the hotel and raved about the day they enjoyed at the spa and on the grounds  the staff were brilliant and so helpful the food excellent and overall a brilliant experience had by all so 27 brilliant reviews in the one 2 day stay making my job easy !!,5,2018,06,28
218,Evening Visit for drinks,"After having a meal in a local Restaurant we decided to go here for a few quiet drinks.

We arrived at 10.30pm the lounge was practically empty but we thought there was a wedding in another quarter of the hotel as there was lots of people coming and going.

The lounge was lovely and the staff really pleasant. There was a singer there and lovely easy listening music.

We went here as the couple with us had their wedding reception here some years ago which we attended and a fabulous day was had by all.

We promised we would go back next time for a meal.",5,2018,06,26
218,very good,"Very enjoyable stay,hotel was beautiful and staff where just as good. We stayed here for my wife's birthday and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a relaxation break. Very central location ",5,2018,06,26
218,Return visit to Killashee house,"This lovely hotel is a must for any stay or vacation
Very friendly staff and fabulous breakfast 
The gardens are lovely and you can even use the hotel bikes for a cycle around the area
Will definitely return ",4,2018,06,26
218,Relaxing hotel,"Lovely, relaxing hotel with very helpful, friendly staff. Delicious food in the bistro and fabulous breakfast. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds and far enough from the main road to avoid noise. I didn't use the spa this time due to time restriction but I did use it on my last stay in January and founf it excellent.",5,2018,06,26
218,Couples night away,"Nice hotel, good location, rooms and spa were all very far apart and spa was a separate building. Would return. Butterfly garden was nice and the weather was find which helped. Had to pay extra for ",4,2018,06,26
218,Great Hotel.,"Excellent hotel.  Spent a lovely afternoon in the Spa, then dinner.   Definitely co complaints.  Bedroom was very clean and reasonably bid.   Good variety for breakfast.   Have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. ",5,2018,06,25
218,Enjoyable Short Stay,"Took the opportunity to stay at the Killashee Hotel on our way to Dublin for a weekend event. Most enjoyable stay, lovely room in the old house, a new matress on the bed wouldn't go astray but a lovely setting. Room was clean, well presented and decorated in theme with it's setting in the old house although with all of the required comforts. We didn't eat in the hotel on the evening of our arrival having already booked somewhere else in Naas but breakfast the following morning was lovely, plenty of choice and always well stocked even though the restaurant was constantly busy. 

We went for a lovely walk around the gardens, well maintained and a nice haven of tranquillity. 

Well worth the stay and would have no hesitation in returning.
",4,2018,06,25
218,A gem of a place,"I had phoned ahead to try and book a few spa treatments during our stay as we were both under a lot of stress at the time.  For one reason or another that call and message was not replied to. I was less than courteous with my next call to the hotel but the staff gently calmed me down and advised me the spa was fully booked. On our arrival, we had been upgraded to a suite....i was quite bowled over as i certainly hadn’t expected this and was deeply touched by their generosity. Our room was beautiful....a large airy living room, separate bedroom with clear views over countryside, and a big bathroom with separate shower and bath. All tastefully decorated in period style with original pieces of furniture from early last century....the type made to fill large spaces. 
All staff made us feel very welcome and at home. Service was excellent from buying a drink at the bar, to reception staff on our arrival, to staff serving our meal in the bistro. Food was delicious....tasty, well cooked and presented and delivered hot to the table. They just couldnt do enough for us. 
Killashee has some of the most beautiful gardens ever that i have had the pleasure to visit. Fountains suttounded by fragrant roses.....sun traps and great places to sit awhile and enjoy the moment. A butterfly garden was a lovely surprise and with views over the surrounding countryside it indeed was a place to sit and be still for a while. Swallows and blackbirds could be heard overhead in the trees and the sky, another fountain gently falling on the background all added to the feeling of calmness and peace. 
This is a big hotel with a lot going on, but there was always somewhere to sit and relax away from the business if that’s what you wanted, or you could be in the centre of everything and enjoy the melee and people watch!!
Killashee is a beautiful place to visit.....the building itself is a treat and the staff certainly bring it to another level. I  would be very pleased and delighted to recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,06,23
218,Excellent and relaxing,"Good option if staying close to Dublin. Comfortable, clean and relaxing. Very good food choice in bar/bistro, and an excellent breakfast. Very accommodating staff. The leisure centre is very good, maybe not the most modern design but everything you could need or require.",5,2018,06,22
218,Enjoyable stay and great value,"Business visit for two days one night just 30 km outside Dublin. While the building looks a bit dated and tired once in the door you are in for a good experience. Excellent attentive service in business meeting rooms, restaurant, reception and bar. Plenty of staff all with great genuine friendly attitude. Good food in the Bistro and a superb breakfast. Bedrooms are large and well fitted. Access to the very large gym and 25 m pool is an added bonus.
Overall an enjoyable stay and great value. Well done to the management and staff at Killashee Hotel.

",4,2018,06,20
218,Positively Exquisite Food!,Nice building but really a wedding machine! It was nice for our purpose but I don't think I would have loved it for a quiet weekend. Bedrooms were average but as I am disabled I found the hotel to require a good deal of movement which is never ideal for me.,4,2018,06,19
218,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel and good accommodation, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the spa is beautiful and relaxing  overall really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to friends and family, well worth a visit ",5,2018,06,19
218,Family occasion,"Stayed here recently for a family special occasion.  Our party included 3 kids under 5 and Killashee was a great spot for them.  Between the pool, playground and play room there was lots to keep them occupied.  I can recommend the babysitting service for mammies and daddies who'd like to enjoy a couple of hours to themselves too.  Food and staff were excellent.  The only criticism I have is that the tiles in the swimming pool (both on the pool deck and on the floor of the pool) are extremely slippy (especially for a 3 year old boy who doesn't believe in walking when he can run!).  That aside, we had a very enjoyable stay",4,2018,06,18
218,Relaxing family stay,We stayed as a group of extended family with kids aged 2 to 9. The rooms were spacious and clean. Breakfast was fab. The extensive grounds were lovely to walk in. The kids loved the playground and fairy trail and the little passport they got on check in. My only negative (and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars) is there was such a late check in. There was a full house the night before and obviously a few late check outs. We arrived about 3 but it was after 6 before we could check in. The staff handled it brilliantly and the receptionist herself went to help get our rooms ready but perhaps management need to ensure there’s more housekeeping staff on the days following a busy night. Other than that it was a lovely stay.,4,2018,06,16
218,Love it!,"Stayed here last November for one night while attending Santa's House Express in nearby Palmerstown House.  I used to live in the area (late 90's) and remember very well the Killashee Hotel opening.  Fast forward to mid 2000's and I stayed here on business on many occasions.  Naturally this was first choice as a base for our trip last year because I know it so well.  I had forgotten just how magnificent the drive up to it and the hotel was in general.  I describe it as the 'Grand Old Dame', classy and elegant. Delighted with our spacious and very warm room.  A Godsend on a really cold winters night.  My son had a nosebleed through the night so I thought I should, out of courtesy, inform reception.  Response? It was no problem at all.  I offered to pay something towards laundry. They wouldn't hear of it.  Breakfast was superb.  I was thrilled to see that they still have my favourite Yoplait Strawberry & Peach yogurt on offer.  Food divine! Can't wait to find another excuse to stay here again.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,06,13
218,Gorgeous location and lovely stay!,"This is a lovely setting with lovely gardens and walks, lovely staff and food.  I couldn't fault it with the exception that the bedrooms could do with a bit of a revamp but aside from that, they are generously sized, comfortable and very clean.  Would highly recommend this place. ",5,2018,06,11
218,Excellent,"Excellent - Only complaint is that room was to warm to sleep in but weather had been exceptional warm.
Food was all excellent as was the service, Great playground for kids and pool was also a hit. Kids loved seeing the rabbits and squirrels around the gardens/playground",5,2018,06,11
218,"Lovely stay,","I really enjoyed our Stay at this Hotel, The food was nice but a little Pricey, Staff were really friendly and Polite. The Gardens and play area are beautiful and well Kept. 1 Fault would be that Kids indoor playroom was a bit disappointing Luckily the sun shone all weekend",4,2018,06,08
218,Lovely Location Great Value close to Dublin,"Stayed recently, last minute booking as I was unable to find accommodation in Dublin, it worked out a treat. Beautiful surroundings, very friendly staff, lots of character and good value for money. I would stay again and recommend this hotel to others.",5,2018,06,08
218,My experience of Killashee House Hotel,"Hotel was fabulous, was at a family wedding. Couldn't fault the hotel's friendly staff or food  but when we went to bed and  turned  the sheets down they  were dirty and we had to have the bed changed late at night. We were very tired. I was disappointed with this,  this really let the hotel down. Also the grout in the shower looked very dirty/discoloured. ",3,2018,06,06
218,Stunning hotel & garden's,"Would highly recommend a visit here, we really enjoyed our stay in one of their suite rooms.
Food good and lovely breakfast also☺ a lil disappointing as advertised not to see a magnificent jacuzzi bath instead a very basic bath with the handle falling off that fits 1 with jacuzzi jets, a lil misleading on their website as this was the main reason I chose this particular hotel and room over others, after spending 220euro this was a lil bit of a let down and also no minibar even if it was an empty fridge to still have 1 in a suite room would have been lovely as watered down wine really wasn't nice since I had to ask for ice to be sent up at a 3euro charge.
Staff very nice and helpful throughout our visit.",5,2018,06,05
218,A great break away,Went to Killashee for a short break over the bank holiday weekend. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The room was spotless and the food and service in the restaurant were excellent.Will definately  return.  ,5,2018,06,05
218,Amazing wedding!!!,"Stayed here for a couple of days for a wedding amazing stay , excellent staff and beautiful scenery . Would definitely recommend to friends. Food was also amazing , rooms were excellent and cleaned every day with fresh sheets and towels.",5,2018,06,05
218,Wonderful stay!,"Had a fabulous couple of days at Kilashee as a present for my birthday. We got the B&B with evening dinner in Turner's restaurant. The room (we got a complimentary upgrade to The Bell Tower) was stunning, and the lovely girl on reception even had a little birthday cake for me on arrival. The staff were so helpful and friendly in all aspects. 

We had lunch in the Bistro which was delicious and the food in Turners was some of the best I have ever eaten. The only thing that put a dampener on things was the amount of christenings and communions on, meaning the place was full of kids running around, shouting and crying etc... Can't be helped but as it's not a cheap place to visit, it definitely ruins it a little for those without kids looking to switch off. My next visit will definitely be during the school year, mid-week! 

The spa itself was also beautiful. We used the hydrotherapy suites and thoroughly enjoyed it. So, so relaxing. We didn't get any treatments, as we didn't think to book ahead - but the range of treatments available sounded amazing. 

All in all I would 100% recommend Kilashee, and look forward to returning! ",5,2018,06,05
218,"A Taste of Luxury - beautiful surroundings, the Butterfly Garden is just heavenly. Loved the resident rabbits, the staff",Never got the ladies names on reception but they were very helpful. The silence when sleeping was amazing. The hydropool was fab and relaxation room so chilling.  I'll be back to stay on weekend breaks .,5,2018,06,01
218,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, but I just found everything was very over priced.","I stayed in this hotel recently for a wedding, it's beautiful and in a great location. The staff are friendly the rooms are clean and the grounds are picturesque. My only con is that everything was very overpriced. ",3,2018,05,31
218,Ireland stay,"The hotel was beautiful although there was a mix up on the package price when we booked out, resulting us nearly being charged considerably more than we should have paid, in addition to us having to be changed to a cheaper menu in the dining room as a result of us being on a special dinner bed and breakfast package which had, obviously, not been passed onto the dining room staff. However, the food was still wonderful even on the lower rate menu",5,2018,05,30
218,Unexpectedly great hotel,"This is a gem of a hotel, very luxurious and vast but yet friendly and welcoming. Great food, lovely big rooms and good leisure centre.  The gardensare beautiful and it is very well suited to families with young children with a play room and outdoor play area. Staff were lovely. ",5,2018,05,30
218,My favorite stay during Irish Tour,"Killashee was by far my favorite “castle” I stayed at during a “grand castle tour” of Ireland.    Magical does not begin to describe the grounds and the beauty of the hotel.  

The best part of the stay was wondering the grounds to find the hidden gardens (butterfly and fairy), special trails, and other unique areas, such as the graveyard for nuns.  

The interior of the hotel is grand.       While very tasteful, it is also opulent and luxurious.     I can’t find anything negative to say or “things to consider.”       

The Killashee was a perfect way to end my grand tour - my mind and memories full of beauty. ",5,2018,05,30
218,I Can't think of A Suitable Title,"Pleasant staff.  Food in the restaurant was very good with prompt and pleasant service. 
The further away from the reception the more worn the hotel.  Torturous route from the reception to rooms numbered up to 124 (?). Why does the first lift show the number ""2"" when it is floor ""3""?
I wouldn't go back on a weekend as the standard of guest attracted seemed to be of an ""Ibiza"" variety. Drunkenness, bad language and shouting in the corridors at 4.30am. I am not a prude but a bit of decorum amount the guests would not go amiss. Having said that I am fully aware that the hotel can't be held totally responsible for badly behaved guests. However if you set out your stall to attract a certain type then you should have checks and balances in place to monitor behaviour. Despite what I have said I would be prepared to try the hotel on a week night.",3,2018,05,29
218,One night stay,Stayed for a wedding last weekend staff very friendly. Food was very good especaily the breckfast which ran until 11. Stayed in a twin room with 2 large double beds very clean. Would have no issue recomending this hotel and will be back soon.,5,2018,05,29
218,Beautiful old buildings with modern top class gym,"Overnight stay so not a lot of detail to give, but the room, food and service were all very good and the gym was really top class. The rooms seemed to be quite far away from reception, bars, restaurant etc. but that is a positive if you want peace and quiet in the evening.",5,2018,05,28
218,"Lovely hotel, great facilities, friendly helpful staff BUT Poor quality food served let the hotel and staff down badly.","Lovely hotel, great facilities, friendly helpful staff BUT poor quality, cheap food served,  especially the breakfast. You know instantly by the standard of the orange juice. Limited choice of only four cerals and cheap substitutes at that, for the price charged. Poor quality ingredients used in the cooked breakfast too. Overall the food let the hotel down big time. The food did not reflect the standard of a 4* hotel, nor for the prices charged. Not good value for money. Poor quality food served let the hotel and staff down badly.",3,2018,05,28
218,Great Experience,"We attended the Killashee for a wedding and it was a superb experience , first class staff , food was great , rooms could not be faulted. Overall a pleasurable experience and we will return again in the future.",5,2018,05,28
218,Killashee House Hotel,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff. I was lucky to be upgraded to junior suite - Beautiful room. Its very charming hotel, with excellent facilities. I was there for a conference and staff could not have been more helpful.",5,2018,05,28
218,Enjoyable stay,"Good for families! Kids loved the fairy doors, playground, play room and pool! Breakfast was lovely and in a beautiful setting. Bedroom was ok. Gallery level was a wasted resource, would have been nice to sit there with a drink if it had lamps and cosy areas. ",4,2018,05,27
218,lovely friendly relaxed place,"We love it . one night family break in the biggest room ever. We had 2 doubles, a single and a fold out double for a family of 5! Great facilities for kids, ie play room, pool, amazing playgrund and fairy park and beautiful gardens. Only downfall, we like to sit in an evening and chill and we had no real bar area for this. it was the bistro which was a tad over priced... kids menu coul d have be 10 total for 3 courses as they were basic courses... mains and desert without drinks was 12 euro nearly alone. 
Otherwise we loved our stay",4,2018,05,27
218,Wedding ,"We got married here last month in the original house and cannot recommend it enough! From the first time we visited to the day after the wedding, the staff were excellent and couldn’t do enough for us.  They made the whole day go flawlessly which made us so relaxed and meant we didn’t have to worry about anything except enjoying yourselves! The food was also amazing and the portions very generous.  The ‘build your own gin bar’ is a great idea and our guests loved it. It was the perfect pick me up after a big meal. 
A big thank you to Paul the bar manager who brought in our favorite beer on tap and even brought in bottles for the snug bar later on in the night.
Also thanks to Sive for dealing with our concerns and questions on the build up to the wedding.
A final thank you to the all the banqueting team and esp. the manager on the day who was brilliant, he was always there on hand without been intrusive.

Best regards,

Anne-Marie and Robert Farragher

So it's worth the vist",4,2018,05,20
218,Beautiful hotel and grounds,Stunning drive up toward the hotel and grounds are lovely for a walk around. My little girl loved the pool and Spa looked fab although I didn't get using as I was hit by flu the morning after we arrived! Would love to go back and try it though.  Can't really comment on food as only ate breakfast one morning which was good,4,2018,05,20
218,stay,gorgeous hotel and grounds looked after very well. very easy to get to. staff were friendly and easy to talk to. rooms VERY clean. only issue was breakfast scrambled eggs like rubber and pudding like a brick,4,2018,05,16
218,Highly recommend,"We stayed here for two nights from the moment we got here to the moment we left the staff were so welcoming and nice, from the front desk to the bistro to breakfast staff to room cleaning staff they were all so helping polite and make the stay that much better. The gardens are beautiful, has a playground for the children, the leisure centre allows children use the pool to 6:45 also having jacuzzi steam room amd sauna’s for the adults. The food here is delicious cooked to perfection the breakfast in the mornings with so much variety to the steaks we had that night. I have read other reviews about this hotel and i cannot agree with some of the opinions as i can really not fault our stay here so with that said thank you to all the staff in killashee for making our weekend the experience that it was",5,2018,05,16
218,disappointed!,"I took my Mum here for one night's dinner, bed and breakfast.  It was definitely not up to our expectations.  The hotel was very busy but very noisy - both day and night and unfortunately both my Mum and I had interrupted sleep due to noisy revellers.  I also didn't expect to see someone lying sleeping on one of the couches when we can down for breakfast the next morning.  Our meal was also disappointing, cold potato fondant being served with our main course - the duck however was lovely.  On a more positive note the staff were all very friendly and attentive and the grounds and rooms of the older part of the building were beautiful. I do not think we will be returning in the near future. ",3,2018,05,15
218,Lovely hotel- let down by some aspects of leisure centre,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the past couple of years. The grounds are gorgeous, the food is tasty, the rooms are great, facilities are clean and hotel staff are friendly.

However, many of these things stop when it comes to the leisure centre.
While the gym is quite big, with lots of modern equipment, along with a great 25m pool. 2x saunas, steam rooms and jacuzzis, there are a few flaws.

The decor is quite outdated and doesn’t match it the standards of the hotel. I have found the bathroom in the changing rooms very dirty on each occasion. And almost the worst of the lot - the reception staff at the leisure centre can never seem to say ‘bye’ or ‘thank you’ in return to me as I walk out the door.

It’s just a shame that two essential aspects of the leisure centre at least (friendliness and clean bathrooms) let the rest of the hotel down.",2,2018,05,14
218,One night stay,"Lovely hotel with gorgeous gardens.
We only stayed one night of our 'tour' here but we would definitely go back.  The food was delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful.
We didn't use the spa on this occasion.",5,2018,05,12
218,We will be back.,"Great family getaway, not cheap but worth it.  Great facilities, spa was good, childrens playground and gardens great and the food  was good.   It was a busy hotel with weddings but you did hot see or hear the wedding parties after the  civil ceremony.  We willl be back.",5,2018,05,09
218,A beautiful escape,"Even though we only had to travel about 35 minutes to get to Kilashee it felt like we were a world away. Beautiful hotel with gorgeous gardens to walk around and wonderful staff who look after guests very well. The beds are very comfortable, and we really enjoyed relaxing in the hydrotherapy suite in the spa, which we feel was worth the €10 charge. ",5,2018,05,09
218,Sisters birthday,"We went here for my sisters birthday. Very nice and large rooms. There were 3 events on that day. A christening A funeral and A wedding 😏
Very very busy. 
We ate in the restaurant and food was very nice. Staff very friendly and helpful. 

Breakfast good variety and choice.

Grounds lovely 

We really enjoyed ourselves  ",4,2018,05,08
218,Bedrooms are away from function rooms so quiet,"We stayed here for one night while attending a wedding.  Our bathroom was a bit dated around the fittings. But the beds are comfortable, the rooms are large and best of all, as they are away from the function rooms, one gets a good nights sleep. No noise from people passing the bedroom, no noise from the rooms on either side. I had the best night sleep I have ever had in a hotel.",4,2018,05,06
218,"Fancy exterior, ho hum guest rooms","Was excited to stay at this hotel after staying at another fabulous estate hotel in another part of the country. Unfortunately this stay was a little lackluster.  While the facade and gardens scream luxurious, the rooms are pretty lackluster and outdated.  Beds were uncomfortable and bathroom was very outdated. Oh well you win some, you lose some.  If you want a true experience, stay at the Lough Eske Castle Hotel outside of Donegal... they know how to do luxury. ",3,2018,05,06
218,Very comfortable ,"I recommend this venue for conferences, meetings, family breaks etc, we spent a lovely few days here and found the staff were helpful and friendly, the rooms very comfortable and the beds were particularly comfy, it is popular too for weddings etc the gym is well equipped and popular with locals, looking forward to coming here again soon.",4,2018,05,04
218,Lovely hotel.,Polite and courteous staff. Very welcoming from the minute we arrived. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would be very happy to stay again in the future. Restaurant staff were knowledgeable about the food and were happy to make suggestions when asked their opinion.,5,2018,05,03
218,Excellent Wedding Venue,"Attended a wedding at the weekend. Was really impressed by the whole set up. Accommodation was nice, food and drink good and prices surprisingly reasonable considering there was horse racing on nearby. ",5,2018,05,01
218,Breathtaking,"The hotel is breathtaking, and very lovely for weddings and special occasions. The outside structure is superb, the drive through is amazing and the inside is equally beautiful. The spa treatment was great and the staff were lovely",5,2018,05,01
218,Overpriced,"Could be a fantastic hotel but need some tlc and investment.Food was good, service in restaurant/bar second to none,room service very good, rooms clean and tidy but dissapointed no minibar and that the room safe was in very awkward porition.

TV in room was disconnected on arrival, this should never have happened.",2,2018,05,01
218,Spa and Bistro,"We booked 2 Spa packages for my daughter's 21st birthday. They were booked out and booked us in this week instead.
The staff were really helpful, the area was quiet clean and very relaxing. We got facial, massages, dry floatation therapy and use of hydrotherapy and thermal suite. Best massage we've ever had (better than Monart, Carton house, etc) No sauna ??
Thank you to Kristie and Clare!
We had lunch in the Bistro in the main hotel Spa area is in a different building! Great options and again staff very helpful, we ordered chicken supreme special and burger fries. The chicken dish was abit disappointing from the way ""It was described"" but We enjoyed it all the same.
Hope to return again soon.",5,2018,04,30
218,What a great place .. a lovely Gem!!,"Loved everything about it 
The place... the food... and the staff
And we had a family function in the Great Hall 
I’ve nothing bad to say ... Sorry but it’s a great spot and Naas is a great busy Village with some great shops and coffee shops too 
Puncherstown Races on the doorstep so a 
Return visit planned soon !!!",5,2018,04,30
218,Punchestown Festival stay,"A lovely, high quality hotel with excellence throughout. Staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. A crazy mix of racing folk, wedding guests, business conference attendees, journalists, drunks, builders, farmers, professional gamblers and body builders made it a fun place to stay.",5,2018,04,30
218,Back again for the 5th year for Punchestown races,"This hotel is so welcoming, stunning architecture large rooms and most of all the staff make it work, Louise on the desk is a very patient and calm through all the craziness of getting guests transported to Punches town,  and I very much appreciated the glass  of wine  on the house after my horse had won, a very nice gesture. The bar staff were lovely people who remembered which gin I liked after sampling many!  and were very attentive , I think it is the genuine people who work there make it such a nice place visit time and time again, well done Killashee you are doing a great job and I would highly recommend anyone to stay here .",5,2018,04,28
218,Fantastic hotel,"Impressive, well kept entrance and grounds. Reception staff were very friendly and professional. Room was excellent, well appointed, spacious. Dinner in the bistro was quick and delicious, we had the burger, tortellini and children’s fish and chips. Breakfast room is very regal and grandiose with great views of the gardens. Manager Graham who served us at breakfast took great care to look after our daughter who was celebrating her birthday. The leisure facilities include pool, kids pool, jacuzzi, steam and sauna, which is all located in a separate building. Lots of activities for children, including playground with zip line.

Certainly recommend the hotel, and will definitely be returning.",5,2018,04,26
218,Nice hotel but won't be rushing back,"My husband and I were very kindly given a Killashee House gift card.  The person who bought the gift card paid upfront for two nights B&B and two dinners in Turners restaurant.  This was written by the receptionist at Killashee on the envelope.  When we called to booked we explained this and also asked to add an additional night to our stay.  Firstly, they had no record of the gift voucher.  When they were able to locate the voucher number I was told that they'd have to check what exactly was paid for/how much the voucher was for and that they'd call me back.  This never happened, I called them back and had to go through the whole mess again.  In the end they got the information they needed and we agreed a fixed rate for the third night which included B&B and dinner in bistro.  Not a great start to the experience but it got sorted so we were happy enough with that.

When we arrived to the hotel we were told we'd been upgraded to a suite which we were delighted about.  The room was lovely.  Separate sitting room with TV and storage, lovely big bedroom and a nice, clean bathroom.  Bathrobes and slippers were also there for our use.  Yes some of the furniture is a bit dated but with this style of hotel it was exactly what we were expecting.  

We had booked in to the restaurant for the Friday and Saturday night but only ate there on the Friday (we went to the bistro instead on the Saturday).  This is not because the food was bad, it was really good.  If you didn't like fish however you were pretty much scuppered!  This is the case with my husband which was the reason for changing our booking.

The food in the bistro is nice.  That's really all I can say about it!  Nothing stands out in my memory as being particularly good or bad.

The Sunday morning of our stay we stood in line for 20 minutes trying to get seated for breakfast!  I totally understand that the hotel was busy but the bistro and conservatory area next to the restaurant were completely empty.  I can not understand why they didn't just open them up and allow people to take their food in there!  I doubt guests would mind carrying a plate a few metres but they certainly minded the queuing.  The food at breakfast was lovely.  All hot and freshly cooked.

The hydrotherapy suite is lovely but I would definitely not pay the extra just to use it!  I find that a pretty cheeky ask to be honest.  I had a facial in the spa, the girl was lovely and I really enjoyed it. 

When we were checking out I noticed that although we had paid upfront, our dinner from the third night was added again onto our bill.  I explained this and it was removed without quibble.

All the staff at Killashee are lovely and it is a nice hotel, just not 4* in my opinion.",3,2018,04,26
218,Tired and dated rooms,"Came for a one night break with a friend and was very disappointed with several things:
> rooms were tired and dated. The beds were hard uncomfortable and well past their use by date. The pillows were poor quality and uncomfortable.
> The food in the Bistro was very mediocre (I should add I burned my palette on the extremely hot and watery chowder). My friends risotto had to stand for at least 10 minutes before she could eat it as yet again it was extremely hot which suggests microwaving. 
> Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the breakfast. Going to the other extreme from dinner the buffet breakfast was cold dry inedible food. 
> shocked to hear that guests were expected to pay to use the leisure facilities 
>Extremely confusing lay out. we had to get a lift to the 3rd floor and then get into another lift to bring us back down to the first floor.
> The one highlight was the warm attentive staff",2,2018,04,24
218,"Luxury, Class & Professionalism at Killashee Hotel","Killashee Hotel is all you want from a luxury retreat. The setting, food, rooms, spa but most of all the staff make you feel special from check in to check out! 
There's so much to locally but also close enough to Dublin but that's if you can bare to leave the hotel itself.
We've been coming to Killashee for 17 years so yes we highly recommend this fabulous hotel and the amazing staff team that give it soul and atmosphere making you want to return. 👌",5,2018,04,24
218,Fabulous,"Fantastic hotel loved every minute of our stay. Could not find a fault with anything, we were given a surprise upgrade to a master suite which made our stay even more special.We will definitely be returning and hopefully stay for a longer break. ",5,2018,04,24
218,"Overpriced, disappointing","This was my second stay at Kilashee, again on business. This stay was for 2 nights and I had chosen a ""Superior"" room this time as I found the room a little basic the last time. I was disappointed, I didnt really see much difference. The room is dated, stains on carpet by the window, grouting in the tiles in shower was dirty, and even the tiles in the bathroom appeared unclean. It was extremely average. On the second day the cleaners never replenished the toilet roll, which should be the most basic thing on the checklist. 
The breakfast and breakfast area is lovely, and the staff in the breakfast area very attentive. I also think the grounds of the hotel are beautiful. I do feel that the rooms are in need of refurbishment, even a very basic one would be an improvement.

The biggest complaint that I have is when I phoned to book the room. We were traveling for a conference and last year there was a special rate. I checked online and saw the basic rate, so phoned to book and asked if there was a special rate for our conference. I was informed that there was, a rate of 160 eur! I quickly informed the girl that the rate online on their own website was 130 for a superior room...yet they were saying to me the ""special"" conference rate was 160 eur for basic! She hesitated and checked it again, and then said she would give me the 130 so as its on their own website. This really concerns me, as I wonder how many people paid over the odds thinking they were getting a special deal.
I dont feel this hotel is doing enough to justify its prices, for 19eur more I stayed in a superior hotel in Dublin city center.",3,2018,04,23
218,Wedding,"We stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding. Room was beautiful, if not a little hard to find! The service on both nights was absolutely outstanding.. we were really looked after by Darren who couldn’t do enough to make our friend’s wedding so special. Food was amazing, we treated ourselves to a spa package the next day which was lovely. All in all, we had a great 2 days and nights.. thanks to everyone who made it so wonderful. ",5,2018,04,22
218,Big hotel,"I’ve spent 2 nights for work and the hotel had everything I needed.
Huge rooms with double bedrooms, nice bathroom and good cleaning.
The breakfast was fine with a good selection of hot food. The only little thing to improve is the stability of the WiFi which is not working fine in every part of the hotel (which is really big and with several areas) and sometimes the 3g connection doesn’t work.",5,2018,04,19
218,One Night Stay,"Myself and 3 friends recently had a 1 night stay in Killashee House Hotel. Overall we had a very nice experience, lovely hotel, and very nice staff.
The highlight of our stay would have to be the Spa, where we had lovely treatments, really enjoyed the relaxation room. My therapist Lauren was excellent and so very nice. The staff in the spa were just lovely.

We dined a few times in Turners restaurant, enjoyed a lovely dinner, really nice food and lovely staff in particular Tomas who looked after us for the whole weekend. Tomas is a gem!
Afternoon tea was nice could definitely be improved upon. The sandwiches in particular were just plain sliced pan sandwiches with the crusts cut off. I do think a bit more attention to detail here is needed, the smoked salmon for example served on brown soda bread.. a variety is definitely needed. Someone mentioned earlier about the mismatched cups and saucers... this was the case for us also... but I assumed this was done by design.... Maybe.. Maybe Not but I was overly bothered by it, but it was definitely noticed. 

We were staying on the second floor, which involved quite a trek to get there, and by the end of the weekend, it was actually very annoying. The trip to the room involved a lift to the 3rd floor, a walk along a gallery and then a lift down to the second floor...
Rooms basic enough, but comfortable and clean.. all that we wanted in fairness.

We didn't get to see much of the grounds, but they looked beautiful. I would consider another stay here.",4,2018,04,17
218,Killashee overnight experience,"Had a lovely overnight stay in Killashee, the facilities and entertainment was second to none. 
The food in Turners restaurant was beautiful, it was a really enjoyable experience. We stayed in a junior suite which was lovely. ",5,2018,04,17
218,Family wedding,My brother recently got married here and though I may be biased it was hands down the best wedding reception I have ever been at .the staff go above and beyond to help and make you feel comfortable. The food for the wedding was amazing and it's just a lovely warm hotel in general. Our room was in the house part of hotel huge spacious bedroom with separate living room and large bathroom. The breakfast was also fantastic. There's a lovely garden and grounds on the premises with children's playground. There's also a large bar which serve great food.cannot recommend killashee house hotel highly enough.our family had a fantastic day and I look forward to visiting again in the near future for a night away with my wife.truly excellent team of staff and compliments to the kitchen in particular for really great food .,5,2018,04,14
218,Afternoon tea,"Just back from an afternoon tea with my daughter at Killashee Hotel. Thanks to Tomas, Mags and the 2 Laura's!! Great service and very friendly! Food was to die for!!! Setting was just perfect. Would highly recommend. ",5,2018,04,14
218,Excellent food,Lovely hotel. Great staff. Excellent food! Would visit again. There is quite a walk from the reception to the bedrooms in what I think is the new wing so these rooms may not be the best for the very elderly.,5,2018,04,12
218,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed one night and had a lovely time. will be back to stay longer. the hotel is friendly and welcoming especially for the kids. The food, rooms, pool and the gardens were beautiful. Cant wait to go back for longer",5,2018,04,10
218,Two night break,We had two nights away with family and all enjoyed it. Even the children had a great time had they had the kids club to go to.   Great few days.away    it is so close to the national stud and kildare village .so there was lots to do ..,5,2018,04,10
218,family wedding,"fantastic except for access to bedrooms for elderly guests, very confusing. wedding meal was one of the best .. bedrooms were to a very high standard. breakfast was top class but price was very expensive for 1 night stay Price & bedroom access were only down fall",4,2018,04,09
218,business stay,business trip friendly staff great wifi and good food in bistro a good breakfast in morning with a good nights sleep. a good sized room with a super hot shower. I will use this hotel on a regular basis as it is 20mins from dublin ,5,2018,04,09
218,"Lovely hotel, not a great room","i have stayed at Killashee previously and most have been lucky as I always got a lovely standard room but unfortunately this time the room was small and very noisy with sound of people talking in the neighbouring room clearly audible.

I was staying alone and at the breakfast I did not find it pleasant to be seated at very close tables with other solo diners.",4,2018,04,09
218,beds,i stayed in the house. sophie was the room we were booked in. after the wedding we were going to bed and we expierenced dry blood on the white sheets of the bed. very uncomfortable and disturbing. staff that night looked after us and we changed rooms. wasnt impressed we had to do so being so late in the morning and being my sister wedding family were only staying the house which I couldnt do so from the job not being done for the staff. next morning as were were chacking out one of the ladys tried to say that the blood that was on the bed from ourslves and fresh blood. was not a nice comment as we paid alot of money on the day. we wouldnt of wanted a change of room if it was our fault. I just expected better ,4,2018,04,09
218,Most relaxed one night stay,"Stayed here with my mam for our birthdays it was lovely from start to finish, warm reception on check in, lunch service was so well run and organised for a busy Sunday with a few events all going on in the hotel. The gardens were a surprise absolutely gorgeous in some spring sunshine. Dinner and bar service in the bistro was delicious and very well staffed. The suite we got upgraded to was huge with a very comfortable bed. ",5,2018,04,09
218,Review April 2018,Overall a lovely stay. A well sized and extremely comfortable room. Food was excellent! Service at both Breakfast and Dinner could be improved on - waiting on tea/coffee for 20 minutes plus at breakfast.,4,2018,04,08
218,Easter break ,"Stayed for two nights with my husband and two children.  We received a warm welcome at reception where receptionist filled us in on all the amenities and was very helpful with any questions. Room was very spacious and clean, beds comfortable.  

Bistro/bar was spacious but disappointingly there was no cosy bar area with comfortable sitting if you just wanted to have a relaxing drink.  We ate in the Bistro the two evenings, food was very tasty and staff very helpful and accommodating.  Lighting and decor in the Bistro in particular is a little off and not in keeping with the style of the hotel at all.  Bright pink panels and garish modern  light fittings make for a very 'bright' eating experience.  Not an atmosphere we felt we wanted to stay in. 

There is a beautiful conservatory area that seems to be shut off to the main guests which is a real pity given that the Bistro is lacking in comfortable sitting areas.

The Leisure centre and pool is large and very clean.  The hotel grounds are beautiful with a well equipped playground. Kids club was a big hit with the kids and staff there were excellent also. 

We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend this hotel.  

A tip for management tone down the lighting to make your common area more cosy in appearance. 

",4,2018,04,08
218,Excellent staff,"Stayed here over the Easter break. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great facilities, lovely setting. Kids loved swimming pool and the playground. Nice walks nestled around the hotel were great. Room very clean ",5,2018,04,06
218,Most relaxing and enjoyable couple of days,"Very friendly staff, stayed in the old house in a very spacious room. Ciara and all staff on reception very helpful. Enjoyed walks on the grounds, spa & gym. Excellent range of treatments and great hydrotherapy facility. Lots of space and training equipment in gym. We got a great deal online and received value for money. Breakfast was a little chaotic but not surprising given it was Easter Break. We will be back.",4,2018,04,06
218,Fabulous stay,"We had a fabulous stay at Killashee House hotel. It’s a very luxurious hotel but caters really well for family’s and children. There is a kids club, pool and playground and lovely garden. The staff are very professional and very friendly. The breakfast is fantastic. I’d highly recommend this hotel ",5,2018,04,06
218,AFTER NOON TEA AT KILASHEE ,My friend won a competition for afternoon tea for two and decided to go there on Easter Sunday and treat her daughter who was starting off her 30th birthday month (it been April 1st). They were going to launch her celebrations with a touch of class. I checked it on d website and thought it looked lovely so decided to join them and treat my sister (instead of the usual Easter egg) at the same time. Was I disappointed. The sambos were two slices of bread cut in half with the crusts removed. No sign of the dainty sambos that one associates with afternoon tea. My sister said afterwards “sure Mam made daintier sandwiches for us as kids for no special occasions”. I will admit she didn’t put smoked salmon in them. The scones were wrapped in a hot serviette which was a lovely touch but the scones were average enough although we did get cream and jam. The cakes that followed were mediocre which we didn’t finish although the birthday girl did take them home. I missed the waiter putting the serviettes on our laps just for the ceremonial aspect of it but the thing that really got me and didn’t think at the time it was something to complain about was the cups and saucers. Out of the four of us only one of us got a cup plate and saucer that matched. The rest of us got a mix of red and white cups with blue and white saucers etc. The waiter took some photos of us and I compared the pics with some I found on line of KILASHEE afternoon tea and there was a vast difference to what we got and the pictures on line. I also noticed they had different cups and saucers which matched each other. Overall we were all disappointed with our experience and I thought the €55 I spent was definitely not worth it. ,2,2018,04,05
218,A Siberian Maze experience!,"We booked this hotel because we were very impressed by a wedding reception that we attended a few years ago. On arrival there was one member of staff on reception and a queue of about six guests. Apparently there was a problem with the computer system. Not to worry - these things happen. Check-in completed we then entered the maze - up in the lift - arrive at Gallery level - walk along a corridor (thinking that your room is nearby) - arrive at another lift - go down a level - walk along another corridor - go through double doors - notice considerable drop in temperature (cold radiators) - arrive at room at last - freezing - call reception - pleasant young man arrives with small heater which he assures us will heat the large space - while room heats up go to Bistro (the word conjures up images of Parisienne chic) - reality check, school dining room with superior flooring and better food - return to room - small heater has also refused to function - request room change- young lady guides us (thankfully!) to new room - a downgrade but warm. Worst part of experience - insufficient woolly sweaters to combat climate change. Best part of experience - being asked for directions by other guests lost in the labyrinth. An architect, an interior designer and a heating engineer could solve all these problems.",2,2018,04,05
218,Just back from a lovely family Easter Break,"Just back from two lovely nights in the Killashee with my husband and two young daughters! I booked the hotel back in Feb for an Easter break and we were not disappointed! The rooms are spotless, beds and pillows more comfortable than many hotels we have stayed in at home or abroad! The hotel seems to have mastered all the comforts needed for a family break, such as plenty for the kids to do but it doesn’t lose the comfort needed for adults, especially the service....from reception to all of the waiting staff they just couldn’t do enough for you. Special mention to the breakfast buffet, there was no shortage of staff, the buffet was constantly being topped up and it was run so well - can honestly say it was one of the best managed breakfast buffet we have seen either at home or abroad and that was despite it being so busy all over the weekend, we were really impressed and full!! The bistro was really really busy on our second night but we retreated to our room to watch a movie and ordered room service (bliss!) which was delivered in no time and just a €5 tray charge - even though there was 2 trays, we were just charged for one! We will definitely be coming back to the Killashee again, we loved it and special thanks to Ciara on reception who couldn’t have done enough for us!! Also, the 10% discount for Kildare village saved us a fortune....thank you 😀👌",5,2018,04,03
218,Exceeded our expectations,"Had a wonderful family stay. Catered for all ages.  Welcoming staff, beautiful grounds, a wide range of facilities to ensure a perfect stay and had lovely meals.  Very quaint layout and full of character if guests take the time to explore.",5,2018,04,03
218,Failure to meet expectaions,"My review of the hotel is based on my experience as part of a party of six mature ladies who booked a DBB package for Friday 16th February.   I had single occupancy of a superior room which I booked for an additional night as I was arriving a day earlier .

We had issues with the original booking as a party member booked by phoning the hotel direct and was informed that there were no twin rooms available and that the package deal was €20 extra than was advertised for single occupancy (€175). She was offered superior double rooms for two people for a reduced rate of €220 per room. We were keen to stay as we had stayed in 2014 and felt the fine-dining package was excellent  and the hotel itself was lovely.

  I later went onto the hotel website and found that there WAS availability for twin rooms and that single occupancy was also available at €155. I contacted reception and was told I would have to book on line to avail of that specific offer. When we made the original booking we were not informed that the hotel website might be able to facilitate our requests. I cancelled the initial booking and re booked using the hotel site which catered for our needs. I also  later booked an additional night B&B for one of the single occupancy rooms at a specific rate (€100) which was confirmed by email.
On check in I gave my card for pre-authorization and when I went to sign in I found I was being charged €130 when I had been quoted €100 for B&B. On querying it I was asked to forward the email and when the receptionist give me the email address I pointed out that the confirmation email had been sent from there. The young lady conferred with a colleague and I was then given the original rate quoted. I requested at this time that the two nights I was booked in for be included and was advised that the Friday night was being charged at €155 which was the appropriate rate. Thus my final account would be €255 excluding any extras.

I paid my account on departure using my Visa credit card but the following day I noted that 2 charges from Kilashee were pending on my account, both for €255. I contacted the hotel and after much explanation the lady I spoke to told me that there were two ID numbers ( possibly due to the 2 night stay being booked singly) and that a preauthorisation was made on check in whilst on checkout my card went through as a sale. I was assured that there would now be only one debit from my account. As far as I am concerned regardless of whether I WAS debited or not there should not have been two charges pending.

I dined in the Bistro on the Thursday and the service was excellent and the food well presented and tasty, although personally I would compare it to Pub grub at an elevated price.

The remaining five members of the party arrived on the Friday and left their luggage at reception as there were long queues for check-in as a wedding party had arrived.  The seating area in the foyer was noisy and crowded so we went into the Bistro as there was no other area to our knowledge available for us to relax and have a drink - the conservatory was reserved for the wedding party, the Gallary bar was not staffed and we were not made aware of the Snug bar which we were later told is not always staffed. We ordered tea and sandwiches and were disappointed with the fact that the tea arrived 10-15 minutes before the sandwiches. Two lovely young waiters did however give a melodious rendition of Happy Birthday when they brought out a cake which I had given to the staff earlier for the occasion.

The hotel was booked because of its fine dining reputation in Turners. Alas on this occasion it was far from fine dining as whilst starters and desserts were lovely, the main course was served luke-warm. The service was extremely slow which is fine if food is cooked to order and served piping hot. Four of the party chose steak due to the limitations of menu choice- there was no poultry or lamb option as the menu choice was fish x 2, pork, a vegetarian option or fillet steak with a €10 supplement! There was also a €4 supplement for chips which we felt extortionate as chips are very frequently an accompaniment to steak .A late request for a portion of chips never arrived.

A drinks order could not be filled to the guests requests as there was no Smirnoff vodka, Gordons Gin or Coors lager. This would be fair were it not for the fact that the wine and drinks list did include Gordons gin when checked. In fairness to the restaurant manager on the night he apologized profusely and we were not charged the steak supplement and were offered a complimentary glass of Prosecco.  However I would argue that the limitations of the menu were such that it was inevitable that many people would opt for the steak, thus adding an automatic supplement to the package. Also there was no mention of supplements when booking. A more appropriate gesture of apology might have been a drink of choice as only two members of the party of six had ordered wine with the meal.

We were not offered nor did we ask for the Kildare Village voucher that was part of our package as we were not intending to visit it. 

The superior rooms in the Belling Wing are lovely and comfortable and the bathrooms are clean and well decorated. The twin deluxe rooms in another wing were also clean although the bathrooms were much smaller. A request from one of the twin rooms for tea cups never materialized. At least two of the four rooms booked had no hotel information booklet except the spa booklet and a menu.

I personally availed of the facilities in the Hydrotherapy Suite and the Suite itself is very relaxing and the staff very professional, informative and helpful. However it’s a pity the €10 charge to hotel guests for using same does not give you access to the relaxation suite.

The grounds are peaceful with hidden gems like the Nuns Cemetery, a children’s playground  and the Butterfly Garden. It would be nice if guests were informed of this on check-in although it may be mentioned in a rooms brochure if there is one – as mentioned there was none in my room.

A huge downfall is the lack of quiet comfortable seating areas where one can enjoy a quiet drink in nice surroundings as by no stretch of the imagination could the Bistro be called a relaxing lounge/bar area. It is to all intents a large dining area with an ornate bar and no easy seating. Also, to be informed that the Gallery Bar and the Snug are not staffed constantly due to lack of demand is unacceptable for a four star establishment especially when some of the more relaxing areas such as the conservatory are not made available to guests when there is a wedding. Whilst as a group we appreciate the complexities of staffing we were taken aback to hear that staffing issues were the reason certain areas were not 'open' during our stay as we were paying guests and our expectations would be that all hotel facilities would be available to us unless it was noted at the time of booking.

The highlight of our stay was to be the gourmet dining experience  Whilst subjective, the lack of menu choice which lead to four guests choosing steak, which had a supplement, is hardly fine dining. The fact that every member of the party had issues with the temperature of the main course is unacceptable. The meal was a huge disappointment as was the lack of a comfortable SERVICED lounge area  following the meal! Overall the stay was far from a 4* experience and most three star hotels would have a lounge area with low seating.
The following advice might be helpful to prospective guests:

Do not book direct with hotel as their information re: availability can be inaccurate and misleading – use their official website to book on-line and you may find better availability as we did.

Check your charges and ensure you have your email confirmations in case of discrepencies in price quoted and price being charged as you may be asked for a copy as I was.

Check your bank account on departure.

If there is a wedding be prepared for areas of the hotel not to be available to you as a guest – eg the conservatory -  it was not available for use on one of the evenings I stayed.

The Bistro area which doubles up as Bar/Lounge has no easy seating and can be very busy as it is serves as the alternative dining area to Turners which is more formal . Not conducive to an intimate chat and seating is at dining tables, on dining chairs, in an open plan format.

Be prepared for alternative lounge/bar areas NOT to be staffed –eg  GalleryLounge and the Snug.

The Snug is quite a distance from the main foyer and dining areas and is not staffed consistently and reception may not inform you of its existence!

If you book a dining package be prepared for supplements including one for potatos/chips (€4).  As a party of six we found the menu limiting - no poultry or lamb dishes so choice was between pork, fish x 2, vegetarian or steak-  which had a supplement of €10. No choice offered in what potato accompaniment we had with the steak or any other dish.

Superior Rooms are very comfortable and ensuites are lovely with excellent showers and separate bath. The Belling Wing was very quiet and conducive to a good nights sleep. Due to the architecture of the building there are long walks to the bedroom wings. Very limited hotel information in the bedrooms we  occupied apart from Spa Brochure and Bistro Menu

The Hydrotherapy Suite is very relaxing but I was informed there is no access to the relaxation suite unless you are having a spa treatment which is a pity as it would really enhance the Hydrotherapy Suite Experience.

There are hidden gems in the gardens like the children’s playground, the Butterfly Garden and the ‘Nun’s Cemetery’- Do take a walk .....

The breakfast choice is good and the cooked to order breakfasts are excellent. The hot buffet breakfast is not so hot - hot as in temperature - but it is tasty. Be prepared to queue for breakfast table if not down early and hotel is busy.

 Every one we came in contact with on a personal level was pleasant and helpful.  Our booking experience was a fiasco and  we found the hotel lacking in relation to relaxing lounge areas . We booked it to celebrate a special occasion with fine dining and relaxation in comfortable surroundings our criteria - the hotel failed us on both accounts!'

Please note that following contact with the hotel, management has offered us complimentary afternoon tea, free access to the the hydrotherapy suite  ( I was the only member of the party tof six  to use the hydrotherapy suite)  and a reduced rate on b&b in a twin room (€120-00 per night) 
I myself stayed in a single occupancy superior room which was lovely and comfortable but I do not think we will return unless we decide to drop in for the complimentary afternoon tea en route to another establishment!

218,Afternoon Tea NOT AT ALL as advertised on website :-(,"When we looked on their website, we were very excited about what they advertise for Afternoon Tea: (copy & pasted directly from website, accurate still as advertised on 2 April 2018 and I also included screenshots of website wording, see photo 3&4):

Afternoon Tea Menu

Cakes & Treats
Black Forest Cake Pops
Glased Strewberry Tart
Blueberry Cheesecake Macaron
Killashee Ferrero Rocher
Apple & Rubarb Battenburg
Homemade Jammie Dodgers
 
Scones & Sandwiches
Homemade Scones, Butter, Cream & Jams
Honey Glazed Ham, Tomato Relish on Sourdough Bread
Smoked Salmon Wrap, Rocket Lettuce, Chive & lemon Creme Fraiche
Egg & Chive Mayonnaise on Sourdough Bread
Roast Irish Beef, Brioche Bun, Baby Gem Lettuce & Horseradish Sauce
 
Price
Traditional Afternoon Tea - €27.50 per person

BUT the reality was sadly very different - NOTHING was as advertised :-( 
instead, this (see 1st photo) is what came out ... plus a mini scone (half the size of a normal scone, so exactly what you see in the photo plus 2 mini scones = €55 
I will let you decide for yourself if its worth it or not. We pre-ordered 4 afternoon teas when we booked 2 weeks in advance, based on what they advertised their afternoon tea to be (false advertising in my opinion), so I can assure you it was NOT WORTH €110!

None of the cakes/treats were offered as advertised on website at all, and we truly looked forward to the macarons, but they didnt have ANY! The bread was shop bought thin brown and white - same as what my kids would have for school everyday. NO Sourdough Bread, wrap or Brioche Bun AT ALL, just ordinary sliced pan shop bread with crusts cut off. I will include a 2nd photo of what was advertised on Killashee Hotel’s website to show what they made us believe it would be like and then you can play “spot the difference”

I truly hope the management of Killashee will take an honoust look at their website compared to what they actually serve, then either lower the price accordingly OR simply serve what they advertise. ",2,2018,04,02
218,Lovely hotel,"Hotel is lovely, very welcoming and a lovely old style feel. With beautiful drawing rooms to relax. The Butterfly Garden was nothing special just a walk way with wooden butterflies stuck to a wall!!!

Could do with a couple of changes. The restaurant ""The Bistro"" is completely different than the feel of the rest of the traditional hotel with trendy lights and bright pink wall panels. The menu is very basic with little choice although the food we did have was lovely but wouldn't eat there two nights in a row due to poor selection. 

Staff were all lovely and rooms were big and clean. It is unfortunate that the spa and leisure centre is not connected to the hotel and you need to walk outside along back of hotel past bins to get to it. Spa was nice although all the features of the thermal pool were not working. It was €10 to use as we were guests of hotel but €30 if you are not....definitely not worth €30! 

We had afternoon tea which was nice . However, we didn't like certain sandwiches on the menu and asked could they be supplemented by something but they weren't. Another table was constantly being topped up with prosecco free of charge but we weren't! I don't know why we were different, the other table had the same package as us!!!
 
I know I've mentioned a few areas that could do with improvement but I would stay there again without hesitation. We had a thoroughly enjoyable time with super comfortable beds!!!!",4,2018,03,27
218,Great hotel for a relaxing weekend break,"Booked a quiet weekend break for two. Overall we were very happy with the experience. We had requested a quiet room, knowing that it was a popular wedding venue and didn't want to have to put up with all the related noise. Our request was already on file and accommodated as best they could. I felt we could have been more warmly welcomed on arrival but the check in process was easy and competently handled. The hydrotherapy and spa area was a highlight for us. Especially the relaxation room post-treatment. Food and drinks were pretty good overall, considering the numbers they cater for at the weekends. The grounds are pretty and there is a country house feel to the place.Ok, it is a bit dated but it is a very old house and that is part of the charm, we felt. Lots of young, local staff and overall we found everyone willing to do a great job and provide good service. Thank you!",5,2018,03,26
218,great pool area,when booking think of a kings cross B&B but with a good pool and spa the hotel is run down and needs updating now. the food was all you can eat at breakfast was a plus. the staff good do there job with the a smile about as much as you can hope for at this place now for the bad wife had a new shirt stolen and a bottle of Chanel no5  the cleaner had left the room door open all afternoon when we came back from shopping was told by some kids from across the hall all in all would not go back and i have stayed in some bad hotels,2,2018,03,23
218,Terrible,"This was possibly the worst hotel getaway that either of us have been on. Service was atrocious. At dinner we had to ask atleast 4 times for water and the restaurant was empty. Food was pretty bad aswell. To get to leisure center you actually have to leave hotel and when we got there nobody mentioned to us about the spa, instead we were directed to the leisure center which seems to be open to the public and it was fairly dirty. The next morning at breakfast we had to wait in a queue for about a half an hour to be seated. All in all i would never recommend anyone to ever go here, and it annoys me that I have to give even 1 star.",1,2018,03,22
218,Anniversary ,I love this hotel! We got married here March 2015. We have gone back to celebrate our anniversary and it never disappoints. Great food and fantastic staff. Good vase for a shopping trip to kildare village also,5,2018,03,21
218,A night away during St Patrick’s weekend ,"Travelled down on Sunday 18th March late in the afternoon due to the snow the night before but called ahead to find out that the Hotel would not charge for late cancellation a nice touch 
Stayed in Room 133- A nice clean double room. A long walk from reception 
We ate in the Bistro which is a large noisy Area with tiled floors with lots of young families. The food is fantastic. 
Our only negative is the Spa and Leisure is in a separate building which means a small walk outside which means you have to change on arrival- Not mentioned on any of their marketing material but, it was worth the walk 
Nice place for a night away 

 ",4,2018,03,19
218,Lovely Hotel ,Had the pleasure of staying here with friends in February. Great location away from the hustle and bustle of town/city. Staff were pleasant. We ate in the restaurant which was busy on that evening. The food was very nice and good value for morning. The rooms were nicely furnished and had nice views. ,4,2018,03,18
218,Lovely peaceful hotel,"Hotel, grounds and rooms lovely. Helpful and friendly staff and good food in the restaurant although a few more simple dishes on the room service menu would have been welcomed.
The only downside was that the pool was less of a spa pool than a leisure centre so not quite the spa break we were expecting.
Would stay again. ",4,2018,03,16
218,Terrible ,My partner and I stayed here on the 10th of March 2018. We travel a lot around Ireland to hotels and this one was the worst experience we had. On arrival it was not explained breakfast times or where the room was. The lift was broke so we asked a staff member how to get to it as the hotel is like a maze. He shrugged his shoulders and walked off. We then had to go look for a lift that worked as only one flight of stairs. The spa is usually what we like most but you have to trek across the car park to it where it was fully booked up so you couldn't even use the hydro pool. We then went for dinner and the place was filthy food on the floor cutlery on the floor. Service was terrible and the food is extremely over priced. For breakfast there was a Que for 30 minutes with people sitting in the ground waiting to get seated! I have never seen anything like this no apologies nothing. We then went to check out and service was awful just told us how much we owed and goodbye.  We were never asked if we enjoyed our stay if everything was ok.. nothing.  I'm very mad as I sent the hotel 3 emails and wrote on Facebook and not one message back to apologies for our experience.  ,1,2018,03,15
218,Fabulous,"We had a family meal here recently in a beautiful room. The staff were absolutely brilliant, very attentive - nothing was to much trouble. The food was delicious, excellent service. Nothing bad to say!!",4,2018,03,13
218,Saturday night break,"Booked this hotel without doing much research and weren't disappointed. True, the hotel might be a bit the worse for wear but everything else was great; good food, large rooms, friendly service. Nice grounds too and a good leisure centre adjacent. Recommended.",4,2018,03,12
218,"Rundown, disinterested staff and less than average food","We arrived on a Friday evening and stayed until Sunday. I had read some negative reviews but decided to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. On arrival I checked in straight away, there wasn't much of a 'welcome' from the receptionist who was pretty abrupt. I came across this same receptionist a few times unfortunately as the other receptionists seemed to be friendly.. we were directed to our room and made our way to the room, this proved to be a bit of a task, taking a lift to a supposed third floor but really a second floor, we then navagted corridors in an attempt to find the room, all while meeting other guests that were mostly lost, all while carrying heavy bags. 
I had booked dinner in the bistro restaurant/bar, this huge room was neither a bar or a restaurant, it was a large room with rows of tables, not very inviting. Most of the staff were kids, except one or two older experienced staff, young kids that didn't really care about service or quality the food on offer, then the food came, it was tasteless and bland, very disappointing. Then music came on, it was strange, there is nowhere really to sit only at the same table we had dinner at, very strange. Then we went to bed, at this stage I was wishing I had only booked for one night.. the next day I went to the pool and spa area, this was another mission, up lifts down lifts around corridors, then a sign for the spa, I opened a door with a sign reminding us not to forget the room key, I opened the door to realise I had to treck across a car park in the freezing cold to get to the pool area. On my return back after a swim I got to the enterance to the hotel to find a dad and his daughter stranded outside in their bathrobes as they had forgotten their room key.. ridiculous!
All in all, I was happy to check out and will not return...",2,2018,03,12
218,"The Killashee, a shadow of it's former self..","We had a VERY rare chance to head away for an overnight stay recently and choose The Killashee. We stayed here back in 2006, and back then it was stunning. Not any more! In order to get the full benefit from our rare stay we escaped from work a little early and arrived at 3:45pm. We stood in a queue in a very busy Reception area for 35 mins, only to get to the top and be told our room wasn't ready! Check-in is supposed to be 3pm.  We decided to go have lunch, as there was nowhere to sit and wait in Reception (There was a Wedding at the Hotel) The Bistro is like a HUGE canteen area with a Bar...awful. Lots of dirty tables. The whole set up in The Bistro lacks organisation.  There were so many dirty tables, it's just not professional for a Hotel that is allegedly 4 Star. Our food took ages to arrive. I had Cesar Salad, my husband had the Burger, it was lovely, but the dirty tables just made the whole experience awful.  We eventually got our room at 5:25.  Thankfully our room wasn't through the maze of corridors that we heard so many complain about. Our room was a Junior Suite, which is huge. Bed was super comfortable. After we had changed, we were really looking forward to heading to The Snug for a quite drink with atmosphere, alas it wasn't to be, The Snug is only available for private events!!!! We had dinner in Turners, no ambience whatsoever!! 'Turners' is where they serve Breakfast in the morning, it's just another big functional room.  We had the delight of all the breakfast cereal containers being set up while we finished our meal at 10pm...Dinner was nice, although to be greeted by the Maitre'd with the sentence...'Sorry, I'm having a blonde moment' wasn't ideal, I am blonde! Oh, and I requested Balsamic Vinegar for my starter salad, it arrived 10 mins later, apparently the chef had run out of Balsamic, so he made his own...he mixed white and brown vinegar together....!!!  All in all, I would never return. The days of afternoon tea beside the piano upstairs are well gone. The blame obviously lies with the owners, they aren't willing to pay to have enough staff to make this a 4 star hotel again, the staff were all lovely, but desperately under pressure, not ideal in the cut-throat hospitality industry. It's a shame, because it could be exceptional.",2,2018,03,09
218,Nice hotel excellent frontline staff ,I stayed here for one night on a business trip my first room wasn’t suitable and I was immediately upgraded by reception to a very lovely junior suite this however was short lived as I soon discovered I was sharing the room with a mouse 😱new room again which was also lovely. The food was awful at dinner they replaced it with tortellini which was more awful I got a sandwich in the bar which was fine but cost €6.50! Not a crisp or lettuce leaf in sight. I skipped breakfast as I didn’t want anymore food from that kitchen. Strangely the tea and coffee were also dreadful possibly the water quality. I must stress that the staff were excellent very friendly and professional. Lovely grounds great location but due to very substandard food I would be reluctant to return. ,3,2018,03,07
218,Great place to stay,"The Killashee is a lovely hotel. The staff are very friendly and the breakfast is excellent. Rooms are spacious , luxurious , very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Well situated to visit Irish National Stud, Japanese Gardens , Kildare Village and Newbridge Silver.",5,2018,03,05
218,Amazing hotel for relax and spa,"Amazing and beautiful hotel on the green hill with huge and lovelly park around. Romantyczne scenerie, for relaxing weekend away but mot do far from the city dublin. Huge and comfortable room. Huge bathroom. ",4,2018,03,03
218,Wedding,This was my first visit to this hotel and I was absolutely delighted with my 2 night stay. The room was excellent as were the staff. The wedding meal was also excellent. I liked that the wedding guests did not have to leave their tables for staff to prepare an area for dancing. I really enjoyed the breakfast on both mornings. I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a great place to stay. Just one little gripe was the fact that when I went to the Leisure centre onthe morning after I arrived the whole pool was taken over by a swimming club. I certainly will make it my business to return to the Kilashee.,5,2018,03,03
218,Regular visitor,"Stayed in hotel a number of years ago but as I live nearby my visits now are for coffee, lunch, spa. Staff are very helpful and will make every effort to make your visit pleasant. On one occasion there was a problem with billing - this was rectified immediately and compensation offered. ",5,2018,03,02
218,Very good location,Was never here before and someone gave me a present of a weekend stay here. The location was great. There was lovely grounds to walk around. The room we stayed in was very spacious. There was no information pack in the room only a menu.Staff were very efficient. The food was not presented very well and there was not much of a variety. You have to pay to use the spa pool and the lesuire centre even though we staying in the hotel. It needs to have some work done in certain areas. Would go back here.,4,2018,02,27
218,Just a few tips ,Lovely hotel rooms but the room was so far from reception. If you are elderly make sure you ask for a room close to reception!! Massive queue for breakfast in the morning so go between 9 and 10am after that it's crazy. Gorgeous grounds. Unfortunately the spa was fully booked so make sure to book in advance. The bar had a great atmosphere and good food. ,4,2018,02,23
218,One regret - we hadn't more time,"We had an overnight stay here and were delighted. We arrived relatively late, so did not have dinner. The very large bedroom was beautifully fitted and furnished, although the decor was a bit dated - no problem as it fitted in with the ambience of the traditional old building. The leisure centre is equally impressive - 25m , 6 lane pool, large , well-stocked gym. Our breakfast was also excellent, as was the service at reception. I had an appointment, we were offered a late checkout without any hesitation.",5,2018,02,22
218,Wedding,"We recently visited the Killashee for a family wedding and overnight stay.  We were very impressed by the beauty of this venue.  They have retained the historic architecture but have updated everything to be most comfortable for the guests.  Our food at the reception far excelled anything we have ever had at other weddings.  It was delicious!  Our room was well appointed and very spacious.  The breakfast the next day was a bit sparse but I realize there were a great number of guests and it would have been difficult to keep up.  We will definitely stay there again, given the opportunity.",5,2018,02,21
218,"Average, definitely not a 4 star","Stayed here with 2 friends over the mid term. We had dinner at the bistro the first night (included in our deal) and it really wasn't great at all. Goats cheese starter was tasteless and main of seabass was the same. Had to pay an extra 4 euro for a bowl of veg swimming in butter, you would think veg would accompany a fish meal likr this. Dessert of cheesecake was a step up from the other 2 courses. 
Breakfast had a good selection of different food however the place wasn't spotless and little things like the unclean windowsills, paint chipping in the dining room and having to que for over 10 minutes for breakfast on the second morning, really just took a few points off for me.
The bedroom was spacious and clean however, bathroom could do with being updated.
There seems to be great confusion as to how to get from one place to another within the hotel. Lifts are confusing with regard to floor numbers and bedroom numbers. 
We used the hydrotherapy pool for a cost of 10 euro per person.. this was definitly my favourite part. I was very impressed with the chilled atmosphere and the facilities there. However, when we asked for robes we were told because we weren't getting treatments we werent entitled to them, even though we were guests at the hotel??? I thought this was very poor form.
Also in order to get to the leisure centre/spa, you have to leave the hotel and go outside, across a car park. There definitely should be access directly from the hotel. 
The grounds of the hotel are stunning and the old original building itslef is gorgeous too. All in all, it was good value but I don't think I'll be back.",3,2018,02,18
218,Excellent hotel,"Had the pleasure of staying at the Killashee and it was just amazing! From the reception when we landed to checkout the staff were truly welcoming and friendly. The facilities are great. The rooms are lovely, comfortable and warm. Food was also great throughout our stay. ",5,2018,02,18
218,No luxurious Jacuzzi at all,"My husband booked the junior suite for my 40th birthday because he checked the website and they had a luxurious Jacuzzi bath in the room. I was all excited for the weekend and they only have a regular bath, not even a Jacuzzi. Duty manager did the best to keep me happy but the whole idea was to have a private Jacuzzi. I asked members of the staff and they showed me only a regular Jacuzzi in one of the rooms. My husband found this hotel in a list of hotels that had Jacuzzi in the rooms.. so be careful and ask for pictures.. don't believe just in their websites.",3,2018,02,18
218,Good friendly hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights for Christy Moore weekend. The hotel is located about 2 mile outside Naas
It's very clean with great service and excellent staff. 
Room was good size with comfortable bed and very peaceful one of quietest rooms we stayed in any hotel 
Breakfast is great with huge choice and very well organised. Food was good in the bar and again excellent service . A great team effort to feed a lot of people in a short space of time but 70 euro for set meal for 2 in the bar is way overpriced I don't know if this is the normal or just the fact it was such a busy weekend 
The room we were in was on ground floor but we had to take a lift up to the 3rd floor walk a couple of long corridors and find another lift to get us to the ground floor we heard a lot of people complaining  about it but unfortunately it's just the layout of the hotel.

",4,2018,02,16
218,"Our whole experience was amazing, couldn't fault anything","Arrived with my two daughters for our Spa break which we have every January together.  It's Cathy's birthday early January so we like to have a special treat.  We arrived earlier than planned but there was absolutely no problem booking in early.
We were hungry before our treatments so we treated ourselves to tea and scones in The Bistro.  Oh my God they were to die for.  The presentation was beautiful and the scones were so buttery and yummy I wanted more.
Made our way to the Spa area and the layout and ambiance is so warm and welcoming.  Really enjoyed our treatments, well done girls. The place was humming with lots of ladies treating themselves which was brilliant.
Later that evening we proceeded to Turners Restaurant where we were booked for 7.30 for our meal.  Charlie met us at the door and walked us to our lovely table; what a gentleman.  Our table was looked after by Emily and Karl and they were so professional, friendly and helpful.  Emily couldn't do enough to help us.  So well done to you all.  The meal was absolutely magnificent, so tasty and hot.  Can't wait to go back.  Sitting back and watching everyone doing their roles as part of a team was a credit to the hotel.  As quickly as meals arrived out they were served immediately.  The waiting staff are the best I have ever seen in any restaurant.  Keep up the good work and thanks to everyone for making our stay such a success.",5,2018,02,09
218,Very nice 4* hotel,"We had a great time in Killashee hotel. There were a couple things I wasn't very fond of, but that's maybe because I had great expectations.
First of all the hotel is probably one of the most beautiful places we've ever been in Ireland but its configuration is very weird. We had to take a lift up to one floor, walk to another lift, then go down to another floor and then walk a good bit till we get to our room.
Also we found the room a bit cold and not with sufficient heating.
I tried the bistro pub and it was very good.
Overall it was a very positive experience.",4,2018,02,05
218,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed only 1 night unfortunately, hotel was fantastic, staff very pleasant, very clean hotel, beds extremely comfortable, temperature in room spot on as some hotel bedrooms can be very stuffy, food delicious, service top notch too. Have to mention too the entertainment in the bar, seen this guy arrive just him and his guitar and thought, here we go, this won't be up to much, how wrong we were, he was brilliant, we didn't want him to stop singing, well done to Justin !!! I hope he's on the next time we stay!! Well done again everyone!!",5,2018,02,03
218,Excellent Irish hospitality,"Stayed here twice,and both occasions you couldn't fault the service from check in to the food served by the very accommodating staff where nothing is too much trouble.
A short taxi ride into Naas has a lovely Italian restaurant called Rustic will not leave you disappointed.
Thank you to all the team at the Killashee.",5,2018,01,29
218,Girls weekend break,"Booked this hotel for a special 40 birthday we booked 3 rooms on a special weekend spa break which included breakfast one evening meal and a spa treatment we also booked winter special spa package 
From the moment we arrived we where treated brilliant the staff are fantastic the hotel is fab and the food is of top quality 
The spa treatments we got where top class we all enjoyed it so so much and we will be definitely be returning one of the best weekends away I had for a long long time a big thank you to all the staff at Killashee hotel ",5,2018,01,29
218,"Great staff, odd hotel layout.","The staff are great, very helpful but the layout of the hotel, if you're unlucky enough to be in the Belling Wing is odd, to say the least. It was caused by this wing being a later add-on. You have to take a lift to the 3rd floor walk quite a distance and then take the lift back down again-strange!.The rooms are very comfortable and if, like me, you prefer a bath option the water pressure is the highest I have ever experienced.
We had a good dinner but our stay was marred by a cold breakfast, for which the staff apologised and offered a fresh breakfast but it spoiled the stay.",3,2018,01,28
218,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"I was looking for somewhere for Afternoon Tea over Christmas, what a surprise to find a hotel putting on a special ""Christmas"" Afternoon Tea, I haven't seen it before, a lovely idea. 
Booked for 28th December, on arrival, outside of hotel looked lovely, if we had more time, we would have explored the gardens as well. 
I was slightly worried when we walked into reception as there was quite a crowd hanging around either before or after a wedding and some afternoon teas I've had, you're beside reception! I need not have worried, it was in a separate room, far away from the hustle of the rest of the hotel, overlooking the gardens, could not have been more perfect.
Afternoon tea was fabulous, staff really helpful and courteous, explained all the items on the tray, and the scones were served separately on a plate wrapped in a napkin to keep them warm - again, just a small touch, but such a lovely idea to make you feel pampered.
Food was excellent, all freshly made. 
Refills of tea and coffee were offered and staff were on hand in case of any queries. We wanted to take a photo, the staff came over and offered to take a photo for us, again, small thing, but made the day.
Only two small flaws, but it didn't affect the experience at all, the windows could have done with a clean and the directions out of the carpark didn't seem clear (we might have missed a sign or something???)
Couldn't recommend the place more, it feels homely, staff are lovely and am sure a stay here would be special.",5,2018,01,26
218,Pleasant but felt good was lacking,"This was my second visit to Kilashee hotel. Check in & out was fine, slow but pleasant. Our room was lovely and spacious for 2 children, it was very clean. Net curtains though have holes in them. We had dinner in the Bistro, as we were advised to eat here with children. I didn't enjoy my mains I felt seabass wasn't great quality but dessert was beautiful, creme brûlée. My husband did enjoy his. Children's menu was fine with some activities but no pencils provided? Attention to detail! We waited ages for our table to be cleared between courses even though it was well staffed. Eventually I got a servers attention. We decided to order room service for breakfast as we have two small children, I ordered fruit salad and porridge. Fruit salad was bland, melon, grapefruit & pineapple only, plenty of seeds! Porridge was not good and looked as bad as it tasted, I ate neither. Full breakfast was ok. I would return but I would definitely choose my food options more carefully and eat breakfast in restaurant. ",3,2018,01,26
218,Terrible,I’ve been meaning to write this review for some time..I had a horrible two night stay here with my son. I very reluctantly handed over 400 Euro for a two night stay here to the rudest reception staff that didn’t even make eye contact or thank me ONCE for my custom or asked me did I enjoy my stay..which I did not enjoy at all!!!! Restaurant food is horrible and service is terrible (apart from the host) I waited forever for my food and then they got my order wrong and the chef could not rectify it..then when I got to the pool at 6.30 I was told my son was not allowed in after 6.45 (I was so annoyed because if we werent over an hour in the restaurant this wouldn’t have happened) I had specifically checked the pool times in the literature in the room and it said this no where. The layout of the hotel is a bloody disaster! We had to walk through someone’s wedding drinks reception to get to our room..the room itself was only okay..the whole hotel is run down and shabby. I was never more disappointed with my choice and really wish I had taken on board what the reviews on here had warned everyone about! Do not waste your time and money..I have nothing positive to say about my two night stay here!!,1,2018,01,22
218,Great Hotel in Naas Co Kildare,"If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Naas, this is the place. Beautiful hotel and Spa. Had dinner in the Bistro it was great and not expensive. The reception area is very cosy if you want to sit with a drink.  Staff are very efficient and friendly. You can use the pool for free but if you want to use the hydro therapy pool it will cost you €10. The only downside is that the pool/spa is in a different building a few minutes walk away from hotel but worth a visit.",5,2018,01,22
218,Fabulous ,Really enjoyed my stay here. The spa was really nice and the rooms were too. Didn’t eat in the restaurant so no comment there but I would definitely return based on this stay. Not too far from the town centre either,5,2018,01,22
218,The longest walk to your room....,"Stayed two nights lovely looking hotel ambient bar foyer and drive in. Ample car parking, checkin very efficient. We were allocated a room and told to take lift then walk along a corridor then take another lift and after another long corridor we arrived at our room....if not able to walk far please make sure you request a more convenient room close to reception. Our room was lovely with four poster bed beautiful bathroom double sink great shower and bath.  Room nice and warm only downside was the wonky wardrobe with only one key to open its doors it made get in and out of it a bit inconvenient. Bed was ok but nothing to rave about. Ate in the bistro each main course on average about 17 euro each .... quick service and nice cocktails in bar. Breakfast served in turners restaurant good selection can recommend eggs benedict and pancakes also very good. waitresses at breakfast not too friendly but staff at reception very efficient and helpful. Hotel really clean and seem to do a lot of trade for conferences....nice seating area upstairs for quiet time. Nice break away but long walk to room would not suit everyone so be prepared.",4,2018,01,20
218,Expected more ,We decided on a last minute overnight as a treat  and booked this hotel. At check in no directions given on how to find our room up a lift down a lift all very confusing. The room is old and shabby needs an update. We went to the bar/restaurant very disappointed with layout all tables in straight lines no cozy atmosphere at all. Dinner menu very expensive for standard of food on offer. Poor choice on menu with no salads. Also some drunk ladies smoking e cig in restaurant wasn’t great. After dinner we went to relax in foyer but it was very cold and no fire lit even though it was a chilly January night. Other guests had to put on their coats. Phone continuously ringing even though staff member on personal call in reception. Breakfast was ok and the bed were comfortable but we won’t be returning anytime soon as staff seem uninterested.,2,2018,01,20
218,Very Enjoyable Stay,"Excellent hotel with professional and friendly staff. The hotel was close to the lively town of Nass. Room was traditional in style, comfortable with a large cosy bed and a big well appointed bathroom. Breakfast was pretty good, and dinner in the restaurant was tasty and well served. Need to pre book the Spa at peak times otherwise you swim in the Leisure Centre which is widely used by the locals. Staff were very well turned out and smart in their uniforms. All in all an enjoyable and comfortable stay.",4,2018,01,17
218,Room dated and shabby.,"We were really looking forward to our stay but it was disappointing. 

First off, don't book here unless you have a talent for orienteering. You go up a lift, then walk for ages, then up a different lift, There is no ground floor. Apparently. The numbers on the lift don't correspond with the actual floors.  On the plus side we made some friends as we all wandered the corridors lost and hoping for a clue.

I don't know which bedrooms they show on the website, but they were nothing like the room I stayed in.  The walls were grubby, and the decor very standard hotel style. The bathroom badly needs updating and a good scrub. I actually checked to see had I mistaken the ""nice"" hotel with this place when booking! 

The room was cold in the evening and belting hot in the morning.  Something was slapping against the exterior wall in the wind, a wire or something but it was infuriating. The window opens about an inch, but obviously the noise is worse then, but the room was so hot.  After checking out it was a relief to get some fresh air.

We paid extra to have our breakfast in the room, but I hope you're not hungry.  We ordered full Irish breakfasts for two.  The breakfast consists of one sausage, one rasher, one hash brown and a half cooked egg. Oh and one barely cooked mushroom about 3 inches in diameter. You get just one slice of toast each, but you wouldn't need more because the tiny amount of butter provided doesn't stretch far. There was also a croissant that I suspect was just taken from a plastic packet and lobbed on the tray (it wasn't fresh). You get one tiny jam, and one sachet of marmalade.  I assume you're meant to fight it out over who gets what, but frankly after the minimal amount of sleep, due to noise/heat/wandering lost, neither of us had the energy.

I'll give this hotel 5 stars for making me appreciate my very humble home and deter me from ever spending €170 on a night away in a glamorous hotel again.",3,2018,01,14
218,Lovely hotel and superb food,"I stayed here in early December '17. This was the third time I've used this hotel and once again it didn't disappoint. After driving through the grand gated entrance to this former stately home, you wind along a lovely driveway to the car park. The imposing structure of the main structure of the old house is impressive and sets the tone for the rest of the hotel. It feels quite special. There is a lovely atmosphere overall and the decor is tailored to suit the style of the building very nicely. The room was of an excellent standard in both decor and presentation and warm enough.  One slight criticism is that the corridors to the rooms can be quite cold in the winter months. However, this did not detract from the overall experience. I dined in the bistro. I had crab spring rolls to start and pork cutlets as a main course. Both were of a superb standard in presentation, quality, quantity and flavour. Overall, this has become one of my favourite hotels in Ireland.",5,2018,01,06
218,Very Comfortable and Cosy Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel due to a recent visit to Naas.  Aside from the exceptional value for money for my stay, the hotel was very comfortable and cosy.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will return again.",5,2018,01,05
218,Nice enough hotel but confusion layout,"Stayed in November with a group of friends so we booked a few rooms. Found layout of hotel very confusing and not well explained in check in. Reception staff were not very friendly either. 
Room was adequate. Tap in bathroom was dripping all night but otherwise ok. 
Had dinner in the bar and it was ok not as nice as expected. Used the spa the next morning and it was amazing. By far the highlight of our stay and I would return there. Staff so friendly and different from hotel experience. 
Got lost again coming from spa to find our room and I mentioned it on checkout and it wasn’t taken on board. The need for different lifts to get to part of the hotel is not well laid out. Maybe supply a map on check in? Overall not as nice as we had been hoping for on our relaxing break. 
",3,2018,01,03
218,One of our favourite places 😊,"We came across this hotel by accident 4.5 years ago and since then my husband & I have taken our little girl every year after Christmas and most summers too. The last few years we have taken the in laws too. 

As aways the place was spotless and the staff were lovely. We had a great meal in Jacks bar, a lovely breakfast on Sunday morning then enjoyed a walk round the grounds. Since our last visit a big play park has been put in which went down rather well with my 4 year old! 

We couldn’t fault it - perfect for families as the kids are so well catered for both in the hotel and the leisure complex. We will be back again in the summer all being well! ",5,2018,01,01
218,"Nice, but not great","I stayed for one night on Wednesday 27th December. When you arrive there is a nice drive up to the hotels reception, however parking does seem limited. We found a parking spot at the back of the second car park and only had a short walk to reception. 

Reception is well presented with a grand staircase taking centre stage. Check-in was speedy and we were given the keys to our room. The receptionist told us to take the lift to the 3rd floor, walk across the gallery and them take that lift down to the second floor where you will find your room. All of this was a little confusing and poorly laid out in my opinion. Also, while we walked across the gallery we had to walk through a wedding party. This for us was not an issue but if it was my wedding party I would not like to see strangers carrying luggage through my wedding party. 

When we got to the room it was clean and tidy, however it was very dated and the furniture was showing signs of lots of use. The bathroom was small and the shower was in the bath, a pet peeve of mine. There is a tv in the room but again it is quite old and only had a few channels but this wasn't an issue for me.
I didn't have the best nights sleep in the room however, the corridors were quite noisy and it wasn't any of the wedding guests being rowdy, it was just other guests walking to and from there rooms talking at a normal level, but I could hear every word. I could also regularly hear a member of staff wheeling a cart of glasses past our door. I'm not sure why it would be brought by our door but then again the layout is poor so maybe this is normal.
Breakfast in the morning was great, lots of seating so no queue to be seated and lots of food to choose from so no complaints there. The breakfast staff were very friendly and helpful.
Then when it came to check-out it was just lile check-in, nice and quick however I was not asked how my stay was. This for most people may not be an issue but to me it shows that some staff are not interested in how your stay was. 
To summarise, this is fine for a bed for the night, I wouldn't recommend for couples and can't comment for families as I have no kids. As the title states, the stay was nice but not great.",3,2017,12,29
218,Anniversary break,"Loved our stay! We got married there & booked a spa package break for our anniversary. Room/suite was nice & it was very clean! We had a nice little treat waiting in our room for us :)
The spa treatments were amazing! Definitely coming back next year ",5,2017,12,20
218,Relaxing Stay,"Arrived here for two nights and on check in we were upgraded to an ex suite.  Lady on reception was very friendly and helpful. The room was very generous to say the least!! There were plenty of toiletries, towels, extra pillows, blanket, bed very comfortable, room very clean.

We ate in the bistro both nights and enjoyed our food.  We found service in the bistro very good.  

Would have been nice if the Snug Bar had been open to relax in, we were told by a member of staff it was closed.

This hotel is really pleasing on the eye, would return.",4,2017,12,15
218,Meeting with Accountant 12.12.17,We arrived at 11.00 am and say in reception. There was nobody in restaurant  to order a coffee so I asked at reception and were left waiting a half an hour until we had to ask again. We finally got our coffees at 11.50. We then asked for the bill at 1.00 when we ordered another coffee. Still at 2pm we were waiting and when we asked the waitress she said pay at reception but that was the incorrect information. Kilashee you need to get your act together appalling service for a so called 5 star hotel.,1,2017,12,15
218,Don't use the gym! or use for business purposes,"I am a local and have lived for many years in Naas. I was a fully paid up member of their gym until an unfortunate incident occurred in the swimming pool - I was attacked by a disgruntled man and his family (wife, 3 children and 'grand-dad'). I was asked by this man to vacate a lane I was swimming in. I am a lane swimmer - all lanes had been taken up by non swimmers and by breast strokers that day! He was clearly annoyed that I was using the lane to front crawl. I refused to vacate the lane explaining that all lanes were taken up with breast strokers and non swimmers and suggested that we share. He clobbered me over the head with a float! Shocked I got out of the pool to a chorus of insults from him and his family and made my way to the front desk. I explained what happened. One of the staff members accompanied me to poolside and the man apologised after being made to do so! I then asked for the CCTV coverage and was told they did not have CCTV in the pool! I cancelled my membership on the spot and am now a member elsewhere. I received no followup from Killashee, no apology and no explanation. The denying of keeping CCTV was a ruse clearly to prevent me from taking this any further. I have also previously organised work meetings there. As a direct result of my treatment by Killashee House I refuse to host any work events/meetings there and will never use their facilities again. When I posed a review on their web site they took the post down immediately. Not good business!",1,2017,12,13
218,Afternoon tea,"Revisit for seasonal afternoon tea.  Selection of sweet and savoury offerings wonderful.  Prosecution and mulled wine on offer and unlimited coffee and tea.  Service was excellent.  Highly recommend the experience,  lovely setting.  Hotel and grounds exceptional.  ",5,2017,12,07
218,Great Place for Conference Goers and Their Companions,"We have visited the Killashee House many times over the past 15 years. The venue is charming, the rooms are spacious and the staff is incredibly accommodating. Conference rooms are bright with WiFi throughout. Companions either take a taxi to the local town and bus into Dublin or enjoy the sights with a rental car.",5,2017,12,06
218,Weekend Birthday celebrations,"Very poor overall, clean but food not good either in restaurant or bistro and cooked breakfast really poor quality, - in fact, inedible...'second day just had granola and toast . Staff mostly very young and inexperienced, no manager in sight, pestered betweeen courses to order another course immediately in Bistro.  In fact as we sat eating our meal about 9.15 pm one of the waitresses started to hoover around and beside us.!!  
General decor drab and not very seasonal as we had expected, stains on carpets and needs painting very badly. 
There was also a mixup about our booking , apparently a part of 6of us , 3 were to eat in Bistro and 3 in the restaurant.  (hotel's mistake) ... which we were told about just as we relaxed we sat down to eat,- - and  which turned out to be much ado about nothing. 
The lift system is weird and almost unworkable...we met very many others in the lift very dissatisfied like ourselves, not just with the lift. . It in no way measures up to how it is described on website. Would never go back there, very poorly managed.",2,2017,12,04
218,Stunning Venue for a wedding,"I attended a wedding in Killashee. I cannot recommend this as a wedding destination enough. The setting is beautiful. The grounds are stunning and as it is Ireland should the weather go against you the interiors are absolutely fab for pictures too. From start to finish we were looked after so well. As I was bridesmaid we arrived first from Church to make sure everything was ok. We were instantly greeted and looked after by staff. Check in was easy and the suite we stayed in at the old house was beautiful. 

Drinks reception was fab too, there was afternoon tea style sandwiches, scones and cookies and they were delicious and not in any way in short supply! We were also given slider burgers, they even served us outside whist we were getting pictures taken! Main dinner was fabulous too. The only one tiny improvement I would make was to make nicer options for Coeliacs. The brides mother was Coeliac and I did feel a bit sorry for her at dessert as she was just given a massive bowl of fruit... 

I must mention front of house manager Darren - he was so lovely, one of best I’ve come across in hotel industry. He was so friendly and was constantly making sure we were all ok. We stayed two nights and he was there both evenings looking after us. He even went so far as to get the bride & grooms luggage out of their cars and put it in the bridal suite for them. 

I hope to be back to Killashee at some stage. Would definitely consider bringing our son too as I noticed the hotel was extremely child friendly with indoor activities for kids available and a lovely children’s playground too, as well as the leisure Centre we didn’t get time to see! ",5,2017,12,04
218,For the money paid would have expected better - disappointing!! ,"I booked here as a special treat for my Mam’s 60th birthday. In total there were 16 of us, we had afternoon tea followed by drinks and late dinner in the bar and 8 of us stayed the night. The service was extremely disappointing. Between our party we spent the bones of €2k between rooms, afternoon tea and dinner. As I was hosting I was more hyper conscious of being aware that everyone was getting what they needed, once we got afternoon tea served no one come back near us, I had to follow them to try get more teas / coffees, no special touches despite highlighting the fact it was a special birthday. We moved into the bar then where service didn’t improve and we had to chase people down for drinks orders and food came out in drips and drabs when we did order. I should highlight that the rooms are fab and comfy and the food was gorgeous but the level of service let this hotel down massively. For such a big occasion we were all left feeling quite disappointed. To top it off I was double charged for a room however this was sorted immediately once I rang them the following day. I’d think twice about going here again which is a pity as it’s a lovely hotel. ",3,2017,12,04
218,Expensively disappointing ,"I stayed here one night on business. It was a cold, wet, dark evening when I arrived and it was a long walk from the car park to the hotel entrance hall, and it was inadequately signposted. Other guests remarked the same to me. My bedroom was on the first floor, but it couldn’t be accessed directly from the reception area. I had to go up in an elevator to floor 3, walk along several corridors, get another elevator down to floor one and then walk along more long corridors before reached by my room. Another guest checked in just before me, and was allocated a a bedroom near mine, and we both found difficulty locating the second elevator to get down to  floor one. We had to get a member of staff to take us to it. It was tucked discretely away in a corner in the hall of one of the corridors. It was a bit dilapidated looking and looked almost like a service lift. Not what you would expect in such an expensive hotel.

The walk to the bedroom had been so long and confusing that I nearly didn’t venture down to the bistro for dinner. I eventually found my way back down to the bistro, which is located in the reception area, and had had a disappointing meal. I had the meal of the day, a pork/bacon dinner. It wasn’t that it was badly cooked, just that the portion was too small and bland. I had stayed in a hotel in Cork on the previous evening and had exactly the same meal, but that meal was almost twice the size and it had a lot more flavour. 

On a positive note, the room was warm and clean, but that was small consolation for such an expensive stay.",2,2017,11,29
218,Family wedding,"Good ‘country house’ style hotel. Had lunch in the bistro, dinner in the main restaurant, both good. Next day attended a wedding reception: public rooms, food and staff all very good indeed. Bedrooms are American style, ie very big with two beds. Hotel is a bit of a labyrinth but adds to character. Had a pleasant stroll in the grounds, didn’t have time to visit the spa. ",4,2017,11,25
218,5 Star Experience,"I was just in the kilashee spa today on the indulgence package from the moment I walked in the door to the moment i left was just a star experience.

I had Sinead looking after me and she was amazing I would recommend sinead to everyone she is a very professional and the hole experience was amazing. The relaxation room was out off this world.",5,2017,11,21
218,"Pretty poor restaurant , Pool area fine , hotel and grounds beautiful","Stayed there again this weekend . And again the restaurant is its downfall. Very badly managed if I am to be honest . Side orders come 15 minutes after the main course which was crap . Party of 10 ... 9 rated it mediocre to poor . We had the set menu , I had fillet steak , as it is hard to screw up ... but alas no , they found a way . Medium means well done and stewed ( for want of a better word ) , tough , and had a funny taste .. Was sick as a dog for 2 days . Should not have eat it , as I knew it was wrong . My side order of chips were nice . 
Starter was duck spring roll ... Thanks god , I did not eat it . ( enough said ).
Cheap Mango Coulis poured over my dessert to ruin what seemed like a lovely dessert ( all I could taste was mango  )
The Service was the best ( worst bit ) , so bad .. really , amazed at how bad .. Headless chickens is actually a compliment .

On the flip side , rooms are large and clean , beds cosy etc .. perfect actually :)
The pool area is fine and grounds are very attractive .
Breakfast was actually a surprise .. it was delicious !
( again hard to screw up bacon and eggs , but after the meal the night before , I guessed that they would find a way ... but no , it was good , as was service )

I was advised not to go here , as service had gone to the dogs , but have been here before I ignored the advice ( assumed it was a once off , and my friend was unlucky ) . 
The management would be well advised to sit in the lobby and listen to their customers discuss the place . Loads of staff , lack of training . A staff trip to McDonalds would help loads ;)",3,2017,11,20
218,"Great spa, awful food at the bistro ","I went to the spa with a friend, we got a very good service, the ladies were nice and helpful, the pool is great and the dry floatation therapy is amazing. We were really hungry after spending a couple of hours at the spa and decided to stop at the bistro on the way out. That was a mistake. I was served the worst burger of my life (at the price of 16 euros). The meat was nothing like steak and tasted so strong. The texture was like plastic. The bread was obviously de-frozen and the sauce was awful. Even the fries were not nice. When you write “succulent steak” on the menu and serve people a piece of unknown meat that is just plain lie ! ",3,2017,11,20
218,Kilashee spa ,"I brought my father for his birthday earlier in the year. The spa is lovely but lacks facilities like steam room , sauna etc which is usually part of spa treatments. The massage I got wasn't the best and wasn't relaxing. Usually they put something over your eyes when turning around to the front but the girl just talked to me non stop maybe because she is doing numerous massages but that wasn't relaxing for me. The value for the voucher on the deal pages is okay but I've gotten better value ones including afternoon tea with other hotels and other ones came across a lot more professional. I wouldn't be keen to return with the bad massages and unprofessional staff. ",3,2017,11,16
218,Pleasant stay,"We were a group of ladies staying overnight with the plan to do some shopping at the weekend. This hotel worked for us, it was convenient to Newbridge Silverware and Kildare Village.  Lovely grounds, spacious bedrooms and nice bar food. It was quite hard to find the bedrooms,  it was like a maze, we met various guests lost in corridors trying to find their rooms! We didn't use the leasure centre because there was no direct access from the hotel and we would have to go out in the cold, dark rain to get there.
One other thing, I did not like to be addressed to as "" my darling"" by the male staff at reception.",4,2017,11,15
218,Horrible Spa Treatment (Pregnancy),"My lovely husband had booked me in to receive what he assumed was a relaxing massage treatment for me (his 8 months pregnant wife) for my 30th birthday. He booked it over the phone and had mentioned that the woman booking it on the other end seemed to rush him and did not explain the treatment very well but he trusted her judgement and recommendation. He booked a deep tissue massage for himself. We arrived for the treatment 15 minutes beforehand (9.45 am) as instructed. There was no one to greet us at the desk, when the woman did come along, she was very rushed, offered us no forms to fill in and brought us to the changing rooms. Handed me a key to the locker and robe and left me to it. I walked into the hallway, not knowing where I was supposed to go, no-one had told me, this is supposed to be an award winning spa. I ran into the lady in the hallway and asked her and she brought me up stairs, told myself and husband to ""sit there, put your feet up"" and just pointed in a general direction and walked off. We didn't know if she was referring to the relaxation room or the seats in the middle or where. There seemed to be chaos going on over behind a counter area where about 6/7 therapists where obviously in a morning scramble to get their hot towels/hot water ready for treatments. They were running into eachother, making alot of noise and generally it did not provide a relaxing setting. We decided to walk into the relaxation room ourselves as it was chaos and we helped ourselves to water etc. (no-one showed us the relaxation room...) Therapist came along and went into room. I still had not been offered a form to fill out at this stage (I am 8 months pregnant....anything could have happened). I was briefly told what the massage would entail and told to LIE FLAT for the treatment (not supposed to do that at 8 months pregnant for a prolonged period, very dangerous to placenta blood supply). The therapist began on my head and was extremely heavy handed and rough. I have a sore spot on my scalp because she put such extreme pressure on my head, pulled my hair...this was not a relaxing start. She moved to my belly. I understand the treatment is meant to include some belly brushing and belly massage. I highly recommend this treatment should be looked at and changed. The skin of a pregnant belly is so sensitive and should not be belly brushed and not that roughly. She used ALOT of pressure on my belly and because of this my baby kept moving out of the way because it was clearly uncomfortable to him and distressing to me. I could not fatham what the hell she was doing and if she had EVER given a pregnancy massage in her life before but this was awful. The only person that should ever put that much pressure on your pregnant belly is a midwife to check your baby's position. I started crying under my eye pillow and was visibly tense. She had not asked me once at this stage was I ok, how was the pressure..etc. Really poor! She finished with my belly after about 20 minutes.....WAY TOO LONG then moved to my legs which she scrubbed very hard, it was NOT relaxing. I should have gotten up and just stopped the treatment but I was so confused and hoping every moment she would get more gentle but alas it didnt. The treatment ended and I walked myself back into the relaxation room where she found me and gave me some sorbet (didn't offer me water after the treatment). My husband sat beside me and asked how I got on and I burst into floods of tears. I was so so so upset. I was upset that she was so unaware and rough and upset that he had booked this treatment for me with such a good heart and it was awful. The whole experience from the spa setting to the treatment was unrelaxing and completely unenjoyable. My husband did mention it to the woman at the desk when leaving and we did not pay for that particular treatment but he bought me a skin care set to cheer me up and as an extra birthday gift. I will NEVER return to this spa. I will NEVER recommend it to anyone I know. Procedures, training, setting and policies really need to be looked at here. If i find out that my baby has turned out of the birthing position he was already in before the massage because of all the pushing and pressure on my belly I will make a formal complaint and add to it that I was never given a form to fill out which is highly illegal!!",1,2017,11,08
218,Tired looking interior in need of maintenance ,"We Stayed in one of junior suites for overnight break.Before check in we had lovely lunch in bar, food and staff both lovely, upholstery and carpets through out hotel, including bar area, have a lot of staining. Our room was not up to junior suite standard in our opinion, large dark room with minimal disjointed furniture, tv needed to be up on wall to see properly, bathroom very small and jacuzzi bath very small with operating switch broken, needed to be turned on and off from outside bathroom.
Had a drink in bar before dinner and twice received chipped glass, a lot of very young friendly
 staff who just needed a bit more guidance and supervision (in our opinion).
On the plus side our dinner was beautiful and breakfast the following morning also lovely.
",3,2017,11,06
218,Never Again!!,"As a family we went for a relaxing meal in Jack’s Bar at the Killashee last Friday evening. We should have taken our cue from the meet and greet! Unfriendly, disinterested and with not a very complimentary attitude! Things took a turn for the worse when we replied no to having made a reservation, then no again to being residents in the hotel. After all the place was more than half empty and left bing down the road we felt it was fair enough to go to our local hotel for a family meal on a Friday evening. Service was poor, presentation of food worse and quality terrible. Prices of course of the usual high standard!! Very few staff, mainly teenagers who obviously hadn’t had proper training. We had to call for service, waited 10 minutes for a drink which were left sitting on the bar and out of desperation as we had finished eating I had to go and get them myself. Having been to the Killashee on many occasions and for a variety of events over the years I was disgusted with everything last Friday evening. One thing you could always say was the food regardless of price was always lovely and worth the wait. Bring back the days of The Nun’s Kitchen when you wouldn’t mind waiting until a table became free. Very, very disappointing! Definitely not four star quality on any level! For such a lovely hotel in lovely surroundings what a shame. We won’t be returning!",1,2017,11,05
218,They made our wedding,"Just back after having our wedding here. I just can't express how well both I and and my new wife were treated. We were made to feel like royalty for a day. I've never experienced such professionalism and attention to detail in any other hotel before. They went well above and beyond for us. All our guests told us that the rooms were amazing, the food was fantastic and service amazing. The staff and management are so kind and friendly and went out of their way to help us through the weekend. As I and a few of the guests are coeliac, they also catered for us without batting an eye, even going as far as baking us several cakes, and making sambos while we were running around during the day. Safe to say that just a thank you, to everyone who works here and looked after us on our big day, just doesn't cut it enough. ",5,2017,11,05
218,Fab hotel!,"I stayed here a few weeks ago with 2 friends.  We booked a triple room, dinner B&B. I loved the hotel and the grounds were amazing, so beautiful to walk around  and the sun was shining which was a bonus. 
Room was spacious for the 3 of us  and we were provided with a wine cooler no problem when we asked.  It was a bit of a walk from the reception to the room, up and down elevators but this was a only minor inconvience  (when in heels for dinner 😂).
Dinner was really really good.  Our waiter helpful. And they even did up a lovely birthday plate for my friend. 
Breakfast too was excellent. I wanted to stay longer and will definitely make a return visit!",5,2017,11,05
218,Nice tea and scones,We stopped for tea and scones on a trip from Dublin.  Staff was efficient and the scones were delicious.  The hotel is impressive as are the grounds.  Take time to walk around and visit the butterfly garden.   Worth a visit.,4,2017,11,05
218,Shard of glass in my drink didn't raise any eyebrows!,"Just spent two nights in this hotel. It was fine. Ordinary enough.  But we went on the family Halloween package so I thought it would be good for kids in Halloween night. There was nothing laid on bar a babysitting service where the kids could watch a movie or play some games. They enjoyed it nonetheless although Halloween games or even a costume night would have been nice. 
My biggest gripe is that I found a shard of glass in my gin and tonic. I took it out if my mouth and told the bar man who shrugged and threw it on the ground. I suggested he check his other glasses just in case there may be other glasses with shards in them too. He never did. Nor did he offer me a new drink! 

I told reception next day and she made a note of it and took the drink off our bill. Nobody thought anything About one if their guests possibly swallowing glass obviously! 

Also we managed to book this hotel on the phone, check into our room on arrival before we read a wet piece of paper left saying that the ladies changing rooms in the leisure centre were being renovated and therefore there were no showering facilities in the building for women ( and the centre is s five minute walk from the hotel!). There were also no toilets in the pool area and nowhere to dry hair etc. Nothing! Nobody told us this in advance. when I said the facilities were not good the girl in the gym just said 'well it's the last week.' 

We had to walk out through black plastic sheeting into the pool area past all the workmen. And it was freezing cold. Again. No apology. 

The up side was the food was good and most of the staff were nice. But they should inform people at booking that the gym facilities are completely compromised. Especially when bringing kids.  The glass in my drink was an accident but could have been more serious. I was surprised at the lack of concern all around. They thought taking the price of the drink off our bill was enough. 

We had a nice two nights but it's not a hotel for kids. A corporate spot really and the attitude to error was worrying! ",2,2017,11,01
218,Almost there!,"I stayed here for an event over the weekend. The hotel is beautiful, staff were friendly and the function area was lovely - we were all very well looked after.
However, in the rooms we didn't have any bottled water which I found a bit strange for a 4 star hotel. 
There is also no face cloths, which for me is a real pet hate of mine. 
Rooms were very comfortable, I would stay again I just had to deduct a mark for the reasons I gave above.",4,2017,10,30
218,A wedding/event factory - over run with children and unable to provide anything like a unique experience,"Poor value for money. Busy hotel with weddings and events. Too noisy, noise all night from other guests. Unconformable beds and pillows. Hotel so busy no parking. Told no availability in hotel restaurant for guests. Long line to access breakfast room and not asked for tea or coffee order after 20 mins of sitting. Broken window closing latch and bathroom taps loose. Overall a poor experience and I would not recommend",1,2017,10,30
218,Not worth the money ,Bar staff very slow on attending when waiting for a drink.Rooms where very warm and stuffy with no need for it. Booked dinner with reception but they forgot to booked us in for dinner had to wait until a table became available.,1,2017,10,30
218,Well done,"I had the pleasure to stay in the hotel for over 5 nights as corporate guest. Its a excellent warm ver inviting hotel.

Very good food, good for meetings and superb staff. Breakfast was a little delayed every morning...but hey its still a 5* review as its well deserved.

Graham the young gentleman went an good extra mile to look after us. He is a reall credit to the hotel!!!

I will recommend it to all.",4,2017,10,30
218,"Beautiful, historic hotel",This is a special place with oodles of character and charm. I think it was formerly a convent and the character of the building has been beautifully maintained. Stunning surroundings and excellent service makes this a special place to stay,5,2017,10,28
218,Lovely romantic staircase,"We arrived just ahead of hurricane ophelia so wasn't very busy due to cancellations. We walked into a majestic, well decorated foyer, modern but tasteful.
The rooms are a fairly long way to walk to but there are lifts available. We were in suite 340 which was a good size with a spa bath.
They catered for my wheat allergy but my husband thought the service was slow to begin with. Due to the hurricane the pool was unavailable, although there were a few power cuts these only lasted for seconds before the generator kicked in. A shame as the pool looked lovely.",5,2017,10,23
218,"Lovely building, well located, great facilities but a little noisy ","I just attended an event there and slept over one night. I have stayed twice before. The Killashee is in a super location and very attractive historic building with the less beautiful additions largely hidden from the main view. I was in a large, really comfortable and well-appointed bedroom with a super bathroom and very comfortable bed. The facilities for the event were great and I am sure made it easy for the organizers. Two issues keep this from being a 5 star- as big and nice as rooms are, walls are very thin. I heard my neighbors having a great time at 4:30 am. Not good! Also- The old building with its attachments mean the closest elevators don’t bring you back to the lobby. It is quite a labyrinth and would benefit from more clear/ better signage. Otherwise, a wonderful stay!",4,2017,10,22
218,Fantastic birthday celebratory weekend,Spent the weekend celebrating my sisters 50th birthday at Killashee House Hotel. Food in the bar first night was great value and very high standard. Food in restaurant was TOP QUALITY. Thomas the waiter was super and very attentive for someone so young. The room service was second to none with all deliveries made with a smile and the best of customer service. I didn't like the plastic containers for the breakfast cereal they looked cheap. The standard of the cooked breakfast was just ok. Fruit pieces need to be cut smaller. The reception staff could have been a bit warmer and greeted residents as they approached/passed. Overall a super weekend many thanks.,4,2017,10,22
218,Only good for events,"I think staying here is only useful if there is an event to attend since they have lots of those and the space for it. As a business trip hotel it is not ideal since it's outside of town. In general it's overpriced for what is delivered, that goes for rooms as well for the restaurant/bistro. 
What surprised me the most was the rather old looking bathroom and that there was just the basic minimum of cheap toiletries. If I pay so much for a night I want a full set of toiletries in good quality.
Breakfast buffet is very decent though!
I'd not recommend to stay here for a normal trip.",3,2017,10,21
218,Pretty awful experience ,"I didn't stay but instead tried to buy a voucher for a family member. Who knew it could be so difficult! After initially ringing and getting passed to 3 different people, I told the girl what I wanted as advertised on their website. It caused some confusion as it turned out the website price was wrong but they agreed to honour it (website price then changed straight away). However, 24 hours later my card hadn't been charged so I rang again, spoke to a different girl, explained the situation but she knew nothing, trying to explain what happened the previous day was a waste of time and then she proceed to tell me different information regarding how the gift vouchers work then I had been previously told. In the end I requested to cancel the order. All in all a pretty awful experience for what should be a very very straight forward transaction!! ",1,2017,10,17
218,Girls Night away,"Gorgeous hotel, the staff and management could not do enough for us, my only critique would be the Afternoon tea could do with a bit of jazzing up it was bland and boring but management were quick to change the experience and went above and beyond to improve our experience. Our dinner was exceptional really surpassed our expectations when they surprised us with a birthday desert and the breakfast served in the room the next day was gorgeous and above average for what I expected. We also stayed during the hurricane and they were very generous and offered us to stay for the day free of charge if we felt we uncomfortable to leave during the bad weather. We will definitely be back. Thank you to all the team ",5,2017,10,16
218,Expected a bit more,"A family history with the nuns of Kilashee House it was a special day out for my family and I, the place is so well kept and such a beautiful venue. The meal however gets mixed reviews. Service took time to get going and we had to call a server to come to take our orders twice despite it not being overly busy. Soup and Barbecue Ribs got great reactions, the cabbage and apple served along side was light and elegant and the brown bread was divine. The goats cheese was boring and was more focused on pretty presentation than flavour, and the fish cakes were more potato than seafood. Thankfully onto seconds, where the vegetarian was the only disappointment, gone are the days of it being acceptable to just offer a bowl of pasta covered in sauce, which shouldn't be hard to get right but was extremely bland and cool and needed so much more attention. The Cod and Asian Greens went down a treat as did the Beef and the Steak, which was apparently cooked to perfection.  Our final hurdle was desserts, try the Cinnamon Apple Bakewell and the glorious brown bread ice-cream, the showstopper of the meal, which came politely recommended but avoid the Eton Mess like the plague, all but no meringue only some pink shards of decoration. I may be rambling on but a hotel of such a well renowned name should surely have a standard above this. The waiter that took over our table was however far more attentive and really made my Grandad comfortable and he thrived off the light hearted jokes and kind ways! Overall we did enjoy our day but the food just needs that little extra kick to bring this place to all it's glory!",3,2017,10,15
218,Afternoon Tea,"My daughter and I visited the hotel to view it for potential wedding venue. Many thanks to the lovely Breda for showing us around. Personally I was very
 disappointed with the garden area which was being promoted as lovely place for
 photos. The plants and foliage were very badly deteriorated and very poorly cared
 for. The area had not been swept or tidied and there were dirty glasses lying around. Also evidence on the ground of over indulgence!! We were delighted to be given a complimentary Afternoon Tea which was a lovely treat. However, I was very disappointed with this experience. I would expect this to be a very special event but was very let down. The room was dull and quiet. No atmosphere whatsoever. We waited way too long to be served and when tea arrived it was in a very old leaky tea pot. Another 5 minutes before the food arrived. And we had to ask for milk. I would suggest to the staff that they could make a much better effort to give their customers a better experience. We were fortunate that we received a complimentary tea but I would have been very upset to have to pay for that service. The food itself was lovely and beautifully presented. But the service and ambience of the room were a huge let down. We are potential customers who could be spending thousands of pounds on a wedding but this service does not encourage us to do so. 

",2,2017,10,08
218,Fantastic Weekend,We had a really enjoyable weekend at Killashee . Beautiful grounds and location. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. Afternoon tea was really special.Loved it !! 5 Stars  . We shall certainly go back to Killashee at our first opportunity .,5,2017,10,02
218,Not what I would expexct for 4*,"Beautiful hotel, you pull up to the front, note on all the photos it incorrectly shows the main entrance as the nice-looking porchway in the middle - it's not, it's actually a difficult to find side entrance. 

Staff very friendly, place is clean. Our room 180 was beautiful layout, but one window wouldn't open and the other had to be wedged open with a block of wood. I had to ask housekeeping about how to open the window and she said 'where has the block of wood gone'! - Poor, very poor. So she got me a nice new block of wood. 

Bed not the nice plump type you wood expect - all in all the room was nice but tired, needed fresh paint on woodwork - I felt as if the hotel obviously weren't that interested in maintaining high standards.

Resturant food excellent as was the breakfast buffet. However, no cosy seating area - the pub was closed for some reason. In a 4* hotel I expect a resident's seatin garea with nice plump furniture - only seating area here is the entrance lobby which had a business feel about it.

Gardens beautiful but the woodland walk disappointing with builders rubbish strewn.

Overall not what I expect for 4* - best for business travellers.",2,2017,09,20
218,Lovely hotel but average afternoon tea,I recently brought my mother here for afternoon tea. I was hoping it would be a rather special occasion but I was very disappointed in the soulless room where it was served. It overlooked the garden and had a nice view but it was so empty and quiet. The food itself was pleasant but not memorable. The staff were friendly and our waitress was very helpful and attentive. Before I left I had a look in the main bar and it was a large room with televisions showing sport. Not one bit inviting. Most definitely this is a beautiful hotel and the grounds are stunning but not enough to attract me back.,3,2017,09,17
218,Extraordinary!,"I was only in the Killashee Hotel for one night and it was definitely not long enough. The building and grounds are luxurious, historic, and full of charm. Our dinner there that evening was superb. The room was spacious, clean and charming.",5,2017,09,13
218,wedding venue,"My Daughter booked her dream wedding here in the killashee hotel it was everything a bride could ask for that was 2015 before it went into liquidation they booked the big ballroom and paid a deposit of 2,000 euro .
However my daughter became pregnant before the dates she had her little baby 6 days prayer to her wedding, but they gave the venue this notice, and they said they would hold the date for the next year, we were happy with this news . 

My daughter was ready to set the dates for her wedding in the old house a smaller guest list but they were happy that the venue was available on the dates they booked .

My husband and I taught it would be a good surprise if my daughter and I went for a little treat, for dinner and spentd the night there.
So he booked our room 
On arrival at reception we were told our room was not booked having conformation on my phone I had to show it . Not professional at all for 4+ star hotel .
Lots more problems on the night with guests .

Any way we were shown to our room which was occupied with guests already there how embarrassing 
On complaining we were offered another night stay with afternoon tea . We declined for lots of reasons .
Our lift took us to one floor where there was a wedding reception going on and we had our luggage and the reception had to stop while we went to our rooms .
When we went to dinner I was in need of a little drink I only drink Smirnoff vodka as I have allergy to most drinks .
Having asked for Smirnoff vodka twice I knew it was not  because I was feeling ill k

So I went to the bar myself to order Smirnoff and was told they didn't stock it , that's ok if you are told when you order it ..
We have decided  not go ahead with our wedding there .
So be very careful when booking . A lot of money lost here .",1,2017,09,13
218,Disappointing last stay,"I have visited this hotel on several occasions when in the area and never had any major issues. The other reviews are correct that the lift system is confusing and could use better direction - but I understand that is because the building is an old Manor/Schoolhouse which presents architectural quirks such as this. 

However, after this stay I will not be returning to the hotel and will advise others to stay away. I visited with my family and grandparents including small children. The facilities offered for children are subpar and the playroom contained numerous broken toys which were potentially dangerous to the toddler we had brought with us. Now, given these are optional extras - I overlooked this issue at the time. 

My main problem with the stay was that after I had left the hotel, I realised I had left a watch in my room at the hotel on the dressing table. I had left it there as I was going to put it on before leaving so as not to get it wet as I was bathing a toddler. Sadly, I forgot to do so and left the item at the hotel. I contacted the hotel via email and phone numerous times. Email was not returned and each phone call I was passed on to the housekeeping team who then let the phone ring off. I was finally informed that nothing had been found in my room and that if anything turned up they would let me know. The staff I spoke to were helpful but someone in the hotel is being dishonest about the whereabouts of my belongings and, as such, I will not be returning or recommending that others do so.  ",1,2017,09,12
218,Superb Spa experience ,"This place is a must go. Bought it on a deal for my daughters birthday.🎉 From start to finish was super. First we had the hydrotherapy pool followed by 4 treatments with the Elemis luxury  products, 😊then to the flotation bed 👌. Finally the relaxation room and refreshments. We had out treatments done by Emma and Sinead. professional
and friendly.  Got our hair done in Saloon. Staff so helpful and friendly. We then went for food and drinks to the Bistro. Food was fab. Would definitely recommend here and will be back😊 5⭐️",5,2017,09,10
218,Wedding,"Had the pleasure to go to a wedding and spend the night here recently. This is such a beautiful venue, and the grounds and gardens are wonderful also . Everything from the food to the service was excellent. The bedrooms are lovely and welcoming. The breakfast was delicious. The staff and management went above and beyond to make it a fantasic stay.",5,2017,09,09
218,Wonderfull relaxing setting,"Had a two nite stay here, very relaxing easy going hotel.
needed a sat.nav to find the room.
Used the pool ( wonderfull gym and pool area) pty i was out side the hotel.
Grounds were wonderfull for walks day or nite.
Wifi was wonderfull andfast.",4,2017,09,08
218,Nice,Very nice setting and decor and good food and friendly staff but the track to the bedrooms is very long and very confusing to find rooms that's the only down side but had a lovely stay and there is plenty of parking in site also,4,2017,09,06
218,Not worth the money!,"I took my elderly mother away for a 2 night break following the death of my Father. Unfortunately this was not a good experience given that she was having her door beaten at 4.45 in the morning by wedding guests! This scared her and she could not sleep again thereafter. We had the same noise levels further down the floor. I advised reception when checking out and the reaction I got was sorry about that!!!  Not good enough Killashee!

We ate in the Bistro and the food was just OK....they did not have either mint sauce or blackcurrent jelly for the lamb dish and no pouring cream for the porridge at breakfast.

Some rooms (ours) where located miles from reception...so beware!

I would not recommend this hotel when weddings are on........and they could certainly do better in the food front.",2,2017,09,06
218,A wedding stay over ,We stayed on a Friday night for a wedding.the price of 150 pound is steep as it's not a 4 star hotel.rooms a bit run down.its it also very easy to get lost finding  rooms .for the price I have been in better in the UK.the breakfast is buffet and was good .it just looks tired and could do with a tidy up.,3,2017,09,04
218,Very disappointing visit,"Just back from  a 1 night stay and im so glad it was only 1 night.
One of the worst hotels ive ever stayed in.
First of all i had to phone reservations twice before my stay and the girl i was speaking to both times was so rude. She was so blunt and unhelpful.

Anyway onto the hotel itself. From the outside it looks lovely . At check in, just basic info was given to us-time for breakfast and where the lift was.
No mention of any of the so called 'family friendly facilities' on offer.
The room itself is so run down and in desperate need of a renovation. 
The carpet was filthy, walls covered in black marks. The bed was rock hard. Not even any spare blankets for childs cot.
The bathroom was a disgrace. 2 holes in the bath and an old bath mat in it. Shower door was filthy and covered in mould. Broken and missing grout in tiles. Mould inside the lights. Just horrible.
The food in the bistro was just ok. Very expensive- €28 for a tiny steak. We waited about 20 mins for our drinks to come.
The 'fairy garden' is laughable! A few broken fairy doors nailed onto a few trees. My son was so looking forward to this 'attraction 'that is advertised for kids and he kept looking round to see more -but that was it. The playground is a zipwire,swing and a seat that wobbles- thats it. It could be a lovely spot if they actually put any effort into it.
Overall it was a very depressing hotel. It needs a major overhaul. I dont know how it is supposed to be 4*- more like 2*. On check out i was waiting to see if anyone would ask how our stay was but they didnt.
This hotel is so overpriced- i dont know how they can justify their prices.
Id never return and would advise anyone against it.
",1,2017,09,03
218,Could be amazing,"Hotel was very nice looking from the outset, very grand outside and we had the upgraded room which was very spacious, we were very pleased. On arrival we were a little early for the room so went and got a cup of tea in the dining area at 5 euro for 2 cups (a little expensive).
We went for a walk around the gardens around the hotel, which were nice but alot of weeds and just missing a little bit of love (my opinion)
On walking around the hotel, it was clear that the hotel was missing a little love all over, flaking painted windows and doors etc, but did not ruin my experience at all.
There were a few issues with loud behaviour very early in the morning also, but management sorted this out very well, hence I can only say this hotel is worth a visit.",4,2017,08,28
218,More of a wedding venue - not really suitable for a relaxing break,"Caters more to weddings. I wouldn't be going back again for a relaxing break. The restaurant where we were put for the meal included in our package was noisy and more like a sports bar with big screen everywhere showing golf, not at all appropriate for dining. Huge wait to check in. Breakfast was very average as was the dinner. The fact that a supplement of €10 is charged for a steak that costs only €1.50 more than other items included was daylight robbery. If you are going to charge a €10 supplement then make sure the steak is worthy of it! Our room was very noisy, there were people constantly going up and down the hall outside out room and we could hear them as though they were in the room. The room itself was ok - bathroom needs upgrading and the net curtain had a cigarette hole in it. All in all I was disappointed, this was a birthday gift for my mother, not worth the hefty price, certainly wouldn’t return at that price again.",3,2017,08,28
218,Short break,"Stayed for 3 nights for a family wedding. Great room and staff excellent. Breakfast top class. Only disappointment was the cost of the food in the bistro. Very expensive and as the hotel is a taxi away from the nearest town, you either eat there or go hungry",3,2017,08,27
218,Really lovely 2 night stay,"I have just returned for a lovely 2 night stay. There were 12 of us on the 1st night including children & 15 on the second night. We all felt so relaxed during our stay and the staff in all areas of the hotel were very friendly & helpful & very child friendly. Any time we approached staff for help in anything there was always service with a smile. We also had afternoon tea on one of the afternoons which was absolutely perfect in every way. We were a family 2 adults & 3 children staying in a family room which was very spacious & spotless. Could not fault the room at all. We had dinner in the Bistro on both nights, staff were very friendly & helpful again. I would say that maybe there needs to be more choice for the main course on the menu, that would be our only comment on the bistro. The food that we had was beautiful and could not fault in any way.  The kids loved the pool & children's room and loved the little passport which they got stamped when they visited different areas of the hotel & then received and small treat on completion. Great idea!! Thank you Killashee hotel for a fabulous few days, We will definitely return again.",4,2017,08,22
218,Wedding 2017,We just attended a wedding here last weekend and we were very happy with everything in the hotel. The only problem we had was we ordered some extra towels which we were told would he right up. Still waiting. The wedding organiser by the name Darren was out of this world. I have never met a more helpful guy who tailored to everyone's needs and no stone was left unturned and the wedding day and bbq the next day went by without any problems. Could not recommend him any higher.,4,2017,08,22
218,Beautiful Hotel,Stayed here with my friend. Would highly recommend it. Close to Kildare shopping village. Plus you get an extra 10% off shopping village. Lovely hotel. Food and staff excellent. Beautiful gardens. Also have a spa and Leisure centre in the grounds.,5,2017,08,22
218,Afternoon tea ,"I went here for Afternoon tea and I was very impressed. The grounds and interior are fantastic. I would love to come back and stay for a night as it looks fabulous.
Afternoon tea the platters were delicious and well presented. The girls who were hosting, were very pleasant, approachable and had lovely manners.
We attended on a Saturday and it ended up  quite full, but you weren't effected by other parties at all including a baby shower. As this was a small reunion the staff had no problem taking a few photos for us, which is very much appreciated.

Will definitely be back. Thanks for a lovely afternoon.",5,2017,08,19
218,Poor,"Myself and my sister went for a one night stay, overall we found the staff at both the hotel and spa reception to be lacking in experience and not very competent at their jobs. As previous reviewers have pointed out, Kilashee House Hotel looks to be much more on their website than it is in reality. Our hotel room was a long walk from reception through many winding corridors. Our room was very spacious but definitely not 4 star. The hotel overall is not a 4 star in appearance or in quality of service or food. The breakfast was buffet with over cooked and dried out food, very disappointing. The hotel is dirty in places and could benefit from some cleaning and fresh paint. We used the hydrotherapy suit over in the spa (which is a separate building to the back) and the place lacked a feel of 4 star luxury, it was dull and dated, we were glad we didn't book in for any treatments. If I lowered my expectations I might be convinced to go back but honestly there are far more worthy 4 star hotels to visit with actual 4 star quality and 4 star spas.",3,2017,08,17
218,these reviews above are not connected in anyway to Time out - Barbados,"these reviews are for a place in IRELAND. NOT Barbados. please check your reviews before posting.
Nice location. easy access to the beach .  staff was very professional . would visit again. they make you feel like family",4,2017,08,16
218,Not a Great Experience,"Our visit to Killashee Hotel was a disappointing experience.  This was our final hotel of a series during a country-wide castle tour.  The hotel is tired and is need of maintenance.  The restaurant, however, was our biggest disappointment.  Our group was seated together at nice round tables with linen tablecloths, but what was the deal with providing only flimsy little paper napkins when they served ribs and chicken wings as appetizers?  They did provide little packets of wet wipes ... kind of like a barbecue or wings joint.  On our final night we had bread plates and plates full of butter on each table.  When we asked for bread to go with, we were told that the butter was only for those who ordered soup ... just one person at the table!  The accommodation for those in our group with a gluten allergy was weak at best.  The bar only mixes the drinks found on their drink menu.  Also, the service was painfully slow ... both for drinks and our meals. The entire hotel could used some customer service training.",2,2017,08,15
218,Wonderful experience,Recently attended my daughters wedding here. From the moment we checked in it was a wonderful experience. We stayed in the old original house. When we opened the door to our suite we couldn't believe the size of it. We had a sitting room which was huge and the bedroom was further down the private hallway with another door leading to the enormous bathroom. The Windows looked down over the exquisite gardens. The staff were absolutely excellent and could not do enough for us. We dined in the bistro the night before the wedding and the food was excellent. The day of the wedding was everything and more than we could have wished for. I would very highly recommend killashee house to everyone. I will most definitely be returning and cannot wait to do so.,5,2017,08,14
218,Good family experience,"Breakfast amazing, staff helpful and polite, room lovely and bathroom good. Used the pool twice and they give you a lock for locker (plenty of places don't do this for residents) and towels and lend hats. Goggles etc reasonably priced if you forget. 

Garden really lovely and great to explore with kids. 

Quiet room, far from any hotel noise (so a bit of a walk).",5,2017,08,14
218,I wouldn't be visiting again,Therapist and restaurant staff were lovely. Room wasn't great with a camp bed and a grey scratchy material blanket on top. Front desk staff weren't very friendly and came across quite abrupt bar one young girl. Not far from the town which was handy and the taxi man we got was the loveliest . ,1,2017,08,14
218,Beautiful old building and gardens,"We stayed for one night for a wedding. Check in was efficient and we were given directions to our room.
The building has had extensions added on and it can be a bit confusing we had to take two different lifts to get to ours.
The room was in keeping with the age of the hotel. Beautiful old style furniture and a very large comfortable bed.The ensuite bathroom had his n hers washbasins a bath and walkin shower cubicle.
Very clean and everything you need supplied,tea/coffee,bottled water,safe and an extra hairdryer also iron and ironing board.
The leisure centre is in a separate building to the bedrooms we stayed in but was well equipped and I enjoyed an early morning swim,sauna and relaxed in the jacuzzi,
Breakfast was very good as there was buffet full Irish, fresh fruit,cereals etc and also an al a cartel from which I ordered eggs benedict, best breakfast I've had in any hotel I've stayed in for a long time.
A walk in the butterfly garden and stunning gardens is a must.",5,2017,08,14
218,Not the best 4star,"Stayed here in a deluxe double room , have to say was dissapointed , for a 4 star hotel there was a large bottle of warm tap water, no facecloths, & 2 double beds in the room. 
Didn't complain as the room itself was clean, fine.
Had a spa treatment that was supposed to last 25 mins , felt it was rushed , and as a regular spa user found this spa not on par with other 4 star hotels.
Friends of ours had a much nicer room on the newer block of the hotel.
Breakfast was lovely, plenty of choice. Staff friendly at breakfast. 
Cost €150 for the night so I definately expected more. Probably won't return again.",4,2017,08,13
218,Wonderful hotel,"Hi all
Just had a two day stay in this hotel
It was brilliant 
Staff make u feel right at home so quite ideal for kids 
Well done to all 
I would recommend anyone looking for a get away 
Hotel was spotless",5,2017,08,11
218,Don't be fooled by the official pictures,"While the pictures on the hotel websites are not photoshopped or entirely incorrect, they display Killashee Hotel as a large, quaint manor house. However, this is a large resort where they've taken the front of an old abbey (I think it was) and added large blocks of rooms at the back, not visible as you head up front of the hotel. This trick of your imagination is actually somewhat impressing. When we we're going to our room it was miles of corridors from reception to the actual rooms. You should be aware of this if you're looking to stay at a manor house, this is not it - this is a large resort.
Apart from this it was a good  hotel. Though staffed by 4 - 5 receptionists service was slow upon arrival and departure, as there were busloads of tourists arriving at the same time as us. Hotel room was very quiet, modern and clean. 
I would come again, for instance on business, but for a romantic sojourn this is not your best choice.",4,2017,08,10
218,A lovely overnight stay,We were celebrating our 50th Wedding Anniversary and decided that the family would all stay overnight even though they lived relatively close. We had a room in the original house which was really old world. A solid mahogany base to the bed that an army wouldn't move. Old oak furniture. The  room was spotless of course and the shower was great. The spluttering taps added a touch of olden times indeed but that rectified itself quickly. The hotel itself is very busy with many events being held. But there are nooks and crannies where one can relax quietly. The gardens are lovely.,5,2017,08,09
218,2 nights in Kildare,"We spent 2days in Kildare .Killashee is alovely hotel-located in wonderful settings  .very nice walks around grounds .on entering hotel the reception area was nice and airy with very attentive and helpful receptionist .Rooms were  up to 4 star plus standard .Place was noise free ,eventhough ther were quite a lot of family staying .I noticed there was a fine big children's meal and kid club area with a lot of activities .Had evening meal and breakfast .both good .",5,2017,08,08
218,A wonderful experience,"We enjoyed a 2 night mini break in a family room with two small kids and a baby. Everything was  superb.The kids loved the playroom and outdoor space and we even borrowed kids dvds from reception for evenings.Large kids pool was lovely and pristine too.From reception to waiting staff to accommodation staff ,everyone we met was friendly and helpful.Highlight is breakfast,the best we have experienced in a hotel and not at all rushed.Five star experience for this family!",5,2017,08,07
218,Horrendous customer service & false advertising,"My two friends and I decided to have a girl's night away with a spa treatment. We booked the Killashee spa and hotel as we saw they had great reviews but on arrival it became apparent the hotel was not as advertised. The front desk staff were extremely rude and hostile namely a woman named Tara who never smiled once, never gave eye contact and just ignored us. The other staff were not much better with the exception of the bell boys and the bistro restaurant waiter. We booked a triple room online and they gave us a room with two double beds and one camp bed which was pretty much a mattress on the floor. They advertise this room as a triple and it is nothing of the sort. We even requested separate beds when first booking months before. I have attached pictures of the camp bed as I believe it is disgraceful for a '4 star hotel' to expect grown adults to either share beds or sleep on that contraption. The food in the bistro was bland and the furniture was filthy. It was clear from the duration of our stay that the front desk staff have no interest in cutomer service as when we complained about our accommodation the FIRST response of the manager was to offer to ring another hotel for us!!! If I was the owner I do not believe I would appreciate my staff offering customers to my competitors so maybe this something that should be investigated? I also noticed several complaints like ours on this website and the response of the manager in almost all cases was condescending, rude, argumentative and most of all extremely unhelpful. Myself and my friends were appalled and disappointed at our stay and we will not only not recommend Killashee to our friends we will go out of our way to deter potential customers. Good luck to Killashee House Hotel as you will continue to disappoint yourself hiring staff with bad attitudes.",1,2017,08,07
218,Pleasant Stay,"Stayed here recently in Killashee. First impressions were very good with in general well maintained gardens. However, as you drive to the rear of the property it is much less attractive. Check in was very good - lady at reception was helpful. The room was very nice - well appointed with good furniture. The bedding was very heavy for summer - perhaps lighter duvet would be better. There was a great pool and gym however it was very difficult to find from our bedroom - I was staying in the Grayden wing and it was difficult to find. Breakfast was very good - self service for the most part - but there was a good choice of food. There were no pastries left when I was there so that was a minor disappointment. Also I requested a room call the previous evening and never received this so thankfully my phone battery did not die during the night!",3,2017,08,06
218,Hotel and spa,Had a wee overnight stay here recently. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast excellent.  Hotel and grounds could be really nice but need a good freshen up. Pool busy during holiday season and a well equipped gym.,4,2017,08,05
218,3 star hotel. ,"I read reviews on trip advisor before we stayed for 1 night. The reviews were mixed but, I thought I would appreciate the character of an older hotel.  My husband and 2 children (3 and 8) stayed here. 

When we first drove up the driveway and approached the hotel we thought wow! This place looks really fab. Beautiful building and grounds. We were really looking forward to our stay. 

Check in was good and quick. No complaints here. The receptionist explained even though we were on the first floor we were going to the 3rd floor!!! That was fine. We got to the 3rd and then had to take another elevator to the 1st floor. It was all a bit crazy!!! We arrived at our room which was specifically made up for someone with special assistance requirements which none of our party needed. We were surprised by this. Being truthful normally when we arrive in a room. I wouldn't be one to complain but, we really didn't want to stay in the room. 

I went back down to reception and explained to the receptionist and she said no problem at all she would change our room to a room a couple of doors away. She asked would we need help etc. There was no problem. She was very helpful. 

We arrived in our new room which suited our needs. Beds were comfortable. Room was dated. Also, very hot with no air conditioning. 

We went for food in the bistro. The girl that served us was attentive. The food was overpriced and not good. We got the crab and calamari as a main. It was rubbery. 

Breakfast had a good choice. The young staff here compared to other hotels weren't very friendly! 

Disappointing experience. ",3,2017,08,05
218,More like a 5 star,"I stayed here recently with a young family and it was a hugely positive experience. Everything from service to facilities was more akin to what I've experienced in 5 star establishments rather than 4, so I mustn't quite understand the finer points of the hotel rating system. The grounds are immaculate - by far the best-kept, manicured hotel gardens I've ever encountered. Food in the bistro was above average. The room was very comfortable and well-appointed. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in the beautifully maintained historic building among which to wander. Leisure centre and pool are excellent. Check-in and all reception staff were wonderful. I think the high point for me though was the Kids Club - a glorious operation where you can deposit your little darling to be fed and entertained while ma & pa go have an uninterrupted meal. It sounds unbelievable but I can assure you it really does exist. Oh and breakfast was excellent. The combination of all these factors plus the reasonable price make this certainly among the best hotels I've stayed in in Ireland, if not the best. Well done Killashee.  ",5,2017,08,01
218,Loved i so much we booked our wedding here,"We had been looking at Wedding venues for 8 months before settling on the Original house in the Killashee.
Fell in love as soon as I walked through the front door.
Very luxurious hotel - we stayed in a junior suite which was huge. Very comfy bed, full dining area, beautiful bathroom with Jacuzzi bath.. the wallpaper was getting a bit tatty, looks like a child might have got at it with a crayon etc but that was the only fault! 

The bar is gorgeous.

I am a vegetarian so the menu is quite limited for me but I did contact the Bistro in advance and they confirmed it was no bother to change a dish to suit my requirements.
On the night I ordered the Thai curry with vegetables which was no bother for them at all. (Hence im quite surprised to see a review on here giving out that their requirements were not met) 

I honestly think the twists and turns to get to your room add to the charm of this hotel but I can understand some people might not like the layout.

I have to say the staff really make this hotel, they are all incredible. Ive been here a number of times now with both leisure visits and wedding visits and the staff cannot do enough for you. Extremely professional and just really excellent at their jobs.
Ive already booked another nights stay this month and cannot wait to have my wedding here!",4,2017,08,01
218,Lost Sunglasses,"I lost my sunglasses whilst recently staying at the hotel, Carine in house keeping was brilliant, located them and sent them to me.  thank you

Hotel is beautiful and lovely location.  Breakfast was great.  the spa was nice although the large pool had a funny look to it!  Overall a great spot for a girls weekend away.",5,2017,08,01
218,Converted boarding school into hotel with character,"Great wedding venue and conference hotel that offers exceptional food that would give any fine-dining establishment a run for its money. Large rooms and beautiful grounds located at the end of a long, elegant driveway.",5,2017,08,01
218,Quiet elegant retreat,"We stayed for a night to chill out in this hotel. The setting is beautiful, hidden away down a long entry driveway. The main building itself is pretty amazing, and the decor inside is a wonderful throwback to elegant country home living. The buildings have beautiful long winding stairs and amazing gardens. There was actually a wedding on at the same time and I can imagine that it's a very good venue for a wedding. 

We had dinner in their Michelin star restaurant, it was very a reasonable price, and the food was nothing less than amazing.. so so good. I was a tad hungry mind u, but it was amazing.. And they had a desert never seen before, donuts with caramel sauce... There goes the diet.

It's definitely worth a visit, even for afternoon lunch or tea. Stunning country estate retreat. ",5,2017,07,30
218,5 star without a doubt amazing hotel,"Yesterday we attended the wedding reception day and evening of a family member.
Without a doubt one of the best weddings I've attended. From the welcome drinks with afternoon tea it was brilliant. The staff were professional, polite, well mannered and nothing was too much of a problem.
To get over 200 meals out and they all be 'Hot' is not easy, not only were they hot but the food was amazing.
Anyone thinking of booking this hotel for their reception do it would give them a score of 11 out of 10
To add the bedrooms were amazing all very big, very clean and comfortable.",5,2017,07,29
218,Great start to our honeymoon,"From the moment we arrived, not so fresh from a 15 hour day of travel, the views were spectacular. The grounds are simply gorgeous. Upon checking in we were greeted by the friendliest staff we have ever encountered. Tara and Jose at the front desk, and Tomas in the restaurant made our honeymoon amazing. They often went above and beyond in recommending attractions and restaurants, as well as making reservations. We hated to leave, and hope to be back soon!",5,2017,07,27
218,"Lovely hotel, excellent staff and lovely grounds","booked 4 rooms for a family occasion, nice spacious rooms, plenty of amenities. Lots of very comfortable public areas.  Bistro menu was very good with very generous sized portions.  Excellent buffet breakfast.  Staff are very friendly and there are lots of nice grounds to walk around.  The leisure centre is huge and though swim caps are compulsory they are provided free by leisure centre reception.",4,2017,07,27
218,Our 50th Wedding Anniv.,"This was a surprise by our family. The location was beautiful location.. The dinner was wonderful plenty of everything. The staff were very attentive .
The following morning again a great breakfast
All in all a wonderful visit.",5,2017,07,26
218,Not even jumped up pub food,"Ate at the Bistro in Killashee Hotel. Extremely disappointed. Not only does the menu not match their online menu, the menu is very limiting to anyone with allergies. 
As someone who has to eat Gluten free there was almost no main courses I could eat. The chips are on the menu as gluten free however when I ordered them I was told they weren't gluten free! ( Mc Donalds and Supermacs manage to have gluten free chips but Kilashee can't manage it?) I ended up ordering a starter as a main course and made it clear I wanted a main course portion but I got a starter portion! 
The jug of water for the table was warm. 
The bill for 2 starters and 2 Mains came to €57.50 which was extortion for the quality of food we received. ",1,2017,07,25
218,A quality hotel in Kildare,"This hotel is located in a beautiful part of Kildare. The gardens are superb and the old part of the hotel is really beautiful and comes from another era. The leisure facilities were superb and well used. 

I was staying in one of the more rooms in the modern wing and while I thought the room was absolutely fabulous it was like a maze to get there. It was upstairs on a life then walk to one side and then down the lift again to get to my room.

I love this hotel but getting to and from the rooms is undoubtedly a challenge for me and I assume all guests.

The food in the hotel was excellent while the staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,07,22
218,"Perfect, absolutely perfect ","Had a fantastic stay, everything was perfect, staff were all friendly and helpful,  hotel is just beautiful, rooms spacious and comfortable,  hotel quiet and peaceful, leisure facilities excellent, food very good.   This was our first stay but wè certainly hope it won't be our last.  Well done x ",5,2017,07,21
218,Wonderful place to stay ,"From the stunning architecture to the elaborate gardens, your stay at Killashee will be wonderful. We stayed here while traveling and loved it! The comfortable rooms and gorgeous grounds were a real treat!",5,2017,07,21
218,Afternoon tea,"Lovely place for afternoon tea. Food was ok. Staff very polite. 
Even offered to get takeaway of our food if something was left which was very nice and not embarrassing. Definitely recommend for a bit of good time. ",5,2017,07,21
218,Excellent stay,"Booked in for a one stay and business meeting. 
Lovely drive up to the hotel, and very impressive buildings. Reception were very friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and spacious. 
Came to the bar and nice atmosphere. Friendly staff and well priced. Dined and despite no sandwiches on the menu the staff helped out.
All in all very good and would recommend. ",5,2017,07,20
218,Not suitable for people with dietary requirements,"I attended an event in Killashee house last week, despite advanced warning they were unable to appropriately cater for veterinarians, coeliacs and those with food allergies. What was worse than the lack of food itself was the staffs management of the situation. After stating they could provide something they then left a group standing waiting for almost an hour with no update and ultimately no food. It was an absolute disgrace.",1,2017,07,18
218,Hmm..,"On one hand, a major mix up when I booked a room for one adult and two children (12 years x2), rang to confirm, checked again on check in and arrived to one double bed. The suggestion that I should sleep in a camp bed wasn't a welcome one, and it was eventually sorted but only by standing my ground. I have yet to receive the written apology from management. On the other hand, nearly everyone else in my group was upgraded, even though I was one of the organisers.. oh, hang on..! ",2,2017,07,17
218,Lovely Hotel ,"We stayed here during a tour of Ireland with my wife and two children. We were very impressed with the beauty of the building and friendliness of the staff. Out of all the hotels (3) this was by far the best. Accommodation, restaurant, surroundings were all superb. My kids loved the pool and I loved the hot tub. One of the best parts is that we were allowed to stay on in the spa after we checked out. I would definitely recommend this place for a family break. ",5,2017,07,12
218,Great hotel in lovely grounds,"I stayed here for one night with work.  This is a lovely hotel, with a very grand reception area.  The staff were very friendly and efficient.  The room I was in was lovely with a great view of the Butterfly garden.  A very good size, immaculately clean and very comfortable bed.  I ate in the restaurant and had a very good meal, slightly on the pricey side but not overly so.  The breakfast was very good too.
I would 100% stay here again without a doubt.",4,2017,07,12
218,A golf day,"Played a round of golf at nearby Palmerstown GC and decided to stay at Killashee Hotel.  We got a nice suite with a four posted bed which was comfortable.  The ensuite was adequate but very poor water pressure.  However, the staff were friendly and we enjoyed our dinner and subsequent breakfast.  ",4,2017,07,12
218,Relaxing Spa Break,"I stayed here last year with my partner for 2 nights and had a wonderful stay.  The hotel is quite spacious and warm.  The staff friendly and welcoming. The hotel is nice, it could do with a bit of updating, I stayed here years ago, maybe 12-15 years ago, and it was still the same.  Don't get me wrong, it is classic and beautiful and I love this style so absolutely don't want them to modernise it!  But it could do with a little freshening up.

The spa experience was absolutely wonderful.  I had the elemis facial, massage and together we had the rasul which was great fun!  

I would recommend this hotel and will be back, probably in September with my sister for a bit of a pampering break.",4,2017,07,07
218,Pretty good,"Stayed for 2 nights in early July with my wife and our 4 yr old daughter. Hotel looks great on arrival.....amazing architecture, beautiful grounds and swiftly checked in (even at 1pm which was a bit lucky). Room was a really good size with 2 large double beds, clean bathroom if a little jaded. 

Discussing our package at reception we decided to extend our stay an extra night and got a 4 course meal included in the package. Got quite excited about our 4 course fine dining package however when we went down to the restaurant that evening (Sunday) we were informed that the main Turners restaurant was only open on Friday and Saturdays so the 4 course meal was not available to us and we had to eat in the bar. This was ok but wasn't quite what we were looking forward to or excited about. 

Rest of the stay was lovely....decided to have a trek into town on the Monday night and discovered Grace's which was a cracking find. Beautiful decor, fantastic food and at a fraction of the hotels prices which were a little on the steep side.

All good but maybe being a bit clearer on the restaurant opening times and available packages would have been better.",4,2017,07,05
218,Over night stay for 50th birthday.,"8 of our family went for an overnight stay in Killashee hotel and we were very impressed. Hotel and gardens beautiful ,some lovely walks around the garden.  Staff in hotel very helpful,breakfast buffet style was excellent, bistro excellent only service was  very slow. Bedrooms were lovely,very spacious with tea ,coffee.trouser press,etc,would really recommend this hotel.",4,2017,07,04
218,Lovely all round stay,"Having stayed here several times for both work and leisure, I thought it time to write a good review. The staff are always friendly and despite being quite a busy hotel, it always feels relaxed.
The pool and gym are great, clean well maintained. 
The staff a very friendly and helpful and the bar and restaurant both serve very good standard of food.
Naas has a number of nice restaurants only 10 minutes drive however, the food in the Turners restaurant is worth staying in for! Look forward to travelling up again.",4,2017,07,04
218,Great Spa experience,"I visited the Spa at Killashee House hotel last saturday. It was a very relaxing experience. The receptionist was very welcoming. We spent an hour in the thermal suite before our treatments. I had a lovely manicure and my daughter had a back massage, facial and spent time in the floatation room. There was a lovely relaxation room, very oriental ,where I was served a sorbet and herbal tea . A lovely destressing saturday afternoon.",4,2017,07,03
218,Great people & food,This may not be the fanciest hotel in the world (needs a bit of a facelift) but the staff made it a great stay. Stayed as part of a large family gathering (19) and nothing was too much trouble. Food was excellent in both the bar/bistro and the dining room. Great weekend. ,4,2017,07,03
218,Birthday Weekend,"Stayed in the hotel last night. Pleasant greeting at reception. Looks like its a popular wedding venue but i have to say that there was no late night noise that can sometimes be experienced by guests not attending the function.
The restaurant was top class. Attentive staff, great wine and well presented tasty food.
Our room was a junior suite. Very spacious , tastefully decorated and comfortable.
We will be back.
Highly recommended",4,2017,07,02
218,Afternoon tea in Turner's restaurant,"This was my second visit to Killashee House for afternoon tea. I'm pleased to say that the experience has vastly improved. On my first visit several years ago, the afternoon tea was served in the large lounge area of Jacks and the quality of the sandwiches and cakes were poor. 

On this visit the afternoon tea was served in Turner's restaurant, a much more fitting venue for the occasion and price charged ( €25 pp or €30 pp with a glass of Prosecco). Three of our party opted for the sparkling afternoon tea option and while not a large selection of teas available on the menu, we did have options apart from Irish Breakfast tea.

The selection of sandwiches were freshly made and consisted of smoked salmon, egg, beef and ham. The scones were light and served with jam and cream. The top tier of the stand had a small selection of pastries consisting of choux pasty, macarons and chocolate. We did have to ask for more tea as we weren't offered any more once we were served. The waitresses were very friendly and this may be the policy of the venue, rather than an oversight on their part, as the restaurant wasn't very busy.

A very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon and we look forward to returning.",4,2017,06,28
218,Disappointed ,"DISAPPOINTED but no more than everyone else was  .But what do you do at a wedding but say it was grand , it's an Irish thing  
Bass or beef what a good name for a horse and maybe it was  , the bass certainly was poor 
But yes of course it was grand as we say 

",2,2017,06,26
218,A great wedding venue - would definitely recommend,"I really meant to write this review sooner but I've only recently rejoined Trip Advisor. I have been to 3 different weddings at Killashee House & Hotel (1 summer, 2 winter weddings - the most recent being a December wedding for my sister in 2016) and I can confidently recommend this hotel as a wedding venue for any time of the year. 

My sister's wedding took place in the Original House in Killashee and I would definitely recommend this for a wedding reception if you have under 100 guests (but in Ireland good luck with that!). It has great character and the rooms are beautiful - having said that, the larger banquet room (Thomson Suite) is also really lovely if you have a big wedding. 

The bridal party stayed 2 nights in the Original house in December 2016 and all the rooms (which I think were suites) were really spacious, beautifully furnished and very reasonable priced (particularly by Irish wedding standards!). 

On the day of my sister's wedding everything went to plan. The staff - from the managers to the wedding coordinators to the serving staff -everyone did a great job. 

My sister and her husband are both foodies so they were anxious for the evening meal to be really good - Killashee did not disappoint - the food was fantastic. The starters they chose (and I would recommend) were: tian of crab or duck, followed by squash soup and the main was a choice of seabass versus beef medallions - all delicious. By the time dessert came we were too stuffed but the trio of chocolate desserts looked really nice.

Just to say that there was another wedding taking place in Killashee on the day of my sister's wedding - they were totally separate and my sister told me it's in the contract that the brides cant actually see eachother...! The two wedding parties did not cross paths and in all 3 weddings that I've been to at Killashee this has never been an issue.

I've never actually made it to the spa at Killashee but I hear it's lovely and I will definitely check it out the next time I'm there.",5,2017,06,24
218,Wonderful day of spa treatments & afternoon tea,"We spent the day in Kilashee for a spa ""de-stress"" package. We had 1.5 hours in the hydrotherapy suite followed by 5 different treatments all of which were great. The dry floatation is a must try and you feel totally relaxed.  The therapists were so friendly and really added to the relaxed atmosphere.  The facilities were clean and modern. We followed this package with afternoon tea in the hotel - situated in a very nice tea room away from the main area.  Would definitely recommend - there was so much choice and they were accommodating for dietary​ needs. All in all a wonderful day. The only fault was that we hadn't been staying in the hotel as would have loved to have seen the room. ",4,2017,06,23
218,A Wonderful Hitel,"Stayed at the Killashee House Hotel for one night. It's a beautiful hotel with great facilities and fabulous gardens. The bedroom was very spacious, and the restaurant served great food. Highly recommend!",5,2017,06,17
218,Great evening!,The hotel is surrounded by lovely grounds.  We got incredible value for our nights stay which included an evening meal and breakfast. There was live music in the evening which was fantastic. The evening meal was incredible and the breakfast was lovely with a mix of buffet and a la carte. The breakfast wait staff were a little slow at bringing tea and coffee to the table but overall it was a lovely night's stay. ,4,2017,06,15
218,Bistro/Afternoon Tea,"Been to Killashee multiple times and it never let's me down! Beautiful food and the staff are absolutely fantastic! 
Lovely atmosphere and very enjoyable in general. 

Will be back again in July for my own Birthday!",5,2017,06,11
218,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea for 2 couples.
Was gorgeous. Scones were especially nice. 
We had 1 tray between 2 so 2 trays between 4 of us.

Service was excellent. Had some staff who were really happy to be serving us. Bottle or presecco  between us as well.
Apparwtly we got the first day of the new afternoon tea menu so was especially good with nothing in the way of testing mistakes etc.
",5,2017,06,10
218,"What a great place, staff so friendly","Just back today from 2 night stay whilst speaking at a conference. What a really great place, the rooms are very good with everything you need, free access into gym and the staff are so friendly. The food was exceptional, very high quality, at reasonable prices.
I will definitely be going back for a short break with my wife, the Guinness was very good as well.",5,2017,06,08
218,Fantastic break,We're just home from a fantastic trip in Killashee House. We were upgraded on arrival due to our recent engagement to a junior suite. It truly was an amazing room. We ate in the hotels's restaurant for dinner. The menu was very varied and excellent value. The food was very flavoursome and staff were very attentive. Breakfast was served in a bright and luxurious room with plenty to choose from. Our only regret was that we hadn't an extra night! Thanks for everything! ,5,2017,06,06
218,Beautiful Hotel,"Just back from a lovely spa break at the Killashee hotel my daughter is 14 weeks pregnant and she had a massage which she really enjoyed. The bedroom was spotless and beds very comfortable although quite a hike from reception and it felt like a mile walk to leisure centre/spa. We were in room 322 which was very quite even though hotel quite busy . The biggest disappointment was the food my daughter and I both had steaks in the bistro they were cooked ok but pepper sauce was awful more like a red wine jus with a few peppercorns floating about in it my daughter couldn't have it in her steak which made her meal very dry I did as waitress was she sure it was pepper sauce which she confirmed it was. I used the sauce as I couldn't eat a steak without sauce it was so so bland I ended up bringing meat home for my dogs . My daughter had the ice cream and sorbet as described on menu but no sorbet only ice cream and I had an apple galette which seemed slightly stale but I ate it as was hungry overall very disappointing considering we had to pay a €10 supplement each for steaks which were actually the only thing we could have eaten on the very limited menu. Maybe should have eaten in Turners restaurant but it was explained to us as fine dining so we choose bistro as my daughter quite a plain eater.Really thought breakfast would be better but it wasn't I didn't eat a cooked breakfast as only scrambled eggs which were very wet and pancakes that were hard my daughter ended up with sausage and toast and I had toast and jam once again very very very disappointed. 
One last point the tables in the bistro were very close together so much so that the couple at the table next to us spent the whole time listening to our conversation",5,2017,06,03
218,Great management and service ,"We have just had a four night stay at the Killashee while visiting family in Ireland.  We had great service from all of the team.  We had a problem with a room that was unsuitable for health reasons and the duty manager, Roisin McFadden, sorted everything out for us quickly and with great understanding.  She could not do enough for us and we greatly appreciate how well she handled our situation.  The food was very good in the Bistro and the kids loved the swimming pool and the jacuzzi bath in our room.  There are things that can be improved and it is a bit dated in places but overall this is a good hotel in a nice setting with some very good staff.  We will stay here again on our next visit to Ireland.  ",4,2017,06,02
218,More of a conference centre than a hotel,"We stopped here for a midweek night en route to Kerry.  It is a large hotel with a fair walk from the rooms to the main part of the hotel, with conference and meeting rooms and huddles of delegates deep in conversation. It looks grand but lacks warmth and atmosphere, although the food was good, as was the spa in the leisure centre nearby. The walk from the hotel to the leisure centre however was via filthy steps littered with bird droppings and cigarette ends which took the gloss off somewhat.
It clearly caters to conference or meeting guests  and for us, the lack of atmosphere and any sense of warmth and welcome means we will not be going back as hotel guests.",3,2017,05,31
218,Girls weekend away,"Just back from a Fabulous weekend at the Killashee Hotel and I can't praise this hotel enough. From the moment we arrived we loved everything about the hotel. Fantastic service we loved the fact that there were enough staff on so we were looked after so well from Reception to the restaurant and service was fast, efficient and very friendly. Food was superb, desserts were gorgeous. Our room was family 2 double beds and 1 single, big spacious room with wonderful views. We loved our stay so much that we are going back again next month. One last thing excellent value for money.",5,2017,05,23
218,Fantastic night away,"My boyfriend and I stayed overnight Saturday at the hotel last weekend.  What a unique hotel in a fantastic location.  We had read reviews about the rooms being hard to find but seriously this is not a problem. One floor up in a lift and one floor down in another to drop off our bags.  After that we used the stairs and it was no more than a 5 minute walk from reception to the room.  In fact it was lovely to walk through the spacious lounges and enjoy the atmosphere.  We ate in the hotel, around €55 for a 2 course meal and  drinks.  Food was really good and well presented.  Staff were very attentive.  We stayed on in the bar afterwards and enjoyed the live music.  The next day we walked through the lovely gardens and around the hotel.  Plenty of places to relax outside and enjoy the sunshine.  We didn't have time to use the spa facilities but the pool and gym looks impressive.  For people who like shopping, the hotel is a 10 minute drive from Kildaire Village and the actual town of Nass has a lot to offer.  We will definitely return and stay for longer the next time.",5,2017,05,23
218,SPA DAY,i bought a voucher online for a spa package for the killashee spa. the staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for us. the place is spotless and the spa is beautiful. the treatments we received for this package were brilliant and great value for money. the best thing about this experience was actually the Therapist i got was Sian and im not a huge fan of back massage because its always too rough however this massage was the best i have ever got. sh was brilliant the the pressure was perfect and she was so lovely and made me feel very relaxed and comfortable,5,2017,05,22
218,Shopping and spa weekend,"Myself and my sisters really enjoyed our weekend. The staff are really friendly and helpful and we were blown away by the quality of the restaurant ( our package included dinner). The room was large and comfortable and, despite having 2 weddings on the Saturday, the hotel never felt overcrowded. We really enjoyed the leisure centre, which has an excellent 25m pool. We spent Sunday morning in the spa, which was a fantastic way to round off our trip. Proximity to Kildare Village is a real bonus too. Our stay was excellent value and we would definitely return to Killashee.",5,2017,05,18
218,"Lovely venue, great food and service","Attended an event here last week for the first time.  
It's a really beautiful hotel both inside and out.  The grounds are fabulous.  
The room we had was gorgeous with great views over the gardens.  
The food was really good and the service was quick and friendly.  
I'd certainly return.",5,2017,05,17
218,Birthday Celebration ,"Great service, impressive building and stunning gardens, lovely decor throughout, 
Had dinner in the bar, reasonable price and prompt service, live band on that evening.

Rooms clean and well appointed.

Super overnight stay.",5,2017,05,17
218,Really enjoyed our stay - great staff and customer service,"Went with two friends for the spa package and had a great time. The staff in particular couldn't have been nicer and the dinner in the restaurant was top notch. I left my phone in my bathrobe at the spa which had subsequently been sent to a launderette off-site. The spa staff, Bronagh and Sharon, couldn't have been more helpful in getting it back. Had it safely returned a couple of days later. Overall would highly recommend for a weekend break and hope to return again soon.",4,2017,05,14
218,Birthday treat ,My daughter brought me to this beautiful hotel for a day of spa treatments and afternoon tea. Feeling so loved and relaxed I was pampered by a girl called Sian who gave me a great massage and facial. What a great spa to go to would highly recommend it. And if you can have afternoon tea go for it. Fantastic spread. Spotless clean hotel with really great staff.,5,2017,05,12
218,Can't fault ,"Stayed a short overnight here with work, great spot, exceptionally spacious and comfortable rooms, all facilities needed were available. Beds were perfect. Staff were beyond excellent, very polite and friendly throughout. Well located and highly recommended hotel. Only disappointment for me was that I didn't get a chance to explore what appears to be a stunning building and grounds!",5,2017,05,12
218,Mostly Good,"Overall a good experience with just some niggling negative points.

The good first:
The staff are exceptional across the board. All very friendly and helpful.
Food was excellent, we had afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast and all were lovely. The birthday treats for my partner were much appreciated.
Spa was lovely. My partner had some treatments for his birthday and he had nothing but compliments. I used the hydrotherapy area and again this was lovely.
The hotel is in a lovely setting and has great character. We upgraded our room to a junior suite and it was a nice room, very spacious and clean.

The negatives:
Our room was not ready when we arrived which was expected as we arrived quite early so we went on to the spa for our treatments. When we returned to check in we discovered there was no water supply to the room. I couldn't shower properly following the use of the hydrotherapy pool. We were not advised at any stage that there were issues with the water. I had to call to reception to tell them and they were aware the system was having maintenance work done on it. It did eventually come back on.

Our room was overlooking a car park and the gym / spa annex and I was woken up at 7.30am by booming music coming from the gym so not thrilled about that. The window in the room did not close properly and did not block out the noise at all. Then  a car alarm started going off around 8am and kept up for 30 minutes or more so at that point we abandoned our lie in and got up for breakfast / check out.",4,2017,05,11
218,So many thanks for our Wedding day,"Got married in the Original House in Killashee Hotel two weeks ago and, on behalf on my wife and I, thank you all so much for a perfect day. From the day we booked to the day we checked out, we couldn't have asked for more. In the run-up, Lisa-Marie and Katie were fantastic, nothing was too much trouble, and on the day itself, Brian and Sanjeev were excellent. We have received so many compliments from our guests on the food served, quality of the rooms and the organisation in general.

We had a slight snag with our bridal suite and needed to move room, which was unfortunate but not the hotel's fault. Was dealt with promptly and professionally.

I couldn't recommend the hotel any higher for couples considering it for their wedding reception. Wish we could do it all again!

Thanks again,
Cian & Gillian",5,2017,05,10
218,Nice visit,"We stayed as a couple for one night, we had dinner in the bistro. The food was excellent, the bar and waiting staff were very friendly and attentive. The rooms can be awkward to find and require good navigation skills to find!!!. Rooms are clean not luxurious!!!!. Breakfast is good. Overall a nice stay.",4,2017,05,09
218,I liked it,Stayed here.  Great sleep and very nice quiet room.   Very good experience with all staff from check in to leaving.  Ate in restaurant and service and food really well presented.   Had breakfast and it was very good food,4,2017,05,06
218,Stunningly beautiful with exceptional service,"Wow!  We were blown away by our recent stay here.  It is stunningly beautiful.  We stayed here as we were racing in Punchestown but we are going to go back for a weekend to explore the gardens and the spa and the history that surrounds the place.  It is Wow!  The staff who served us were all Irish with their warm smiling natural hospitality.  Very guest focused and the décor is stunning. From arrival to departure after a huge Irish breakfast, Killashee was Faultless!  ",5,2017,05,05
218,More of a big wedding venue rather than boutique country hotel,"A bigger, more corporate venue than we were expecting - more the local big wedding, conference venue than a premium county hotel.  Very friendly staff and, a very comfortable bedroom (with excellent wifi) but honestly no more than I would expect for the premium B&B rate we paid as it was Punchestown Festival weekend.

The only niggle for me is that all bedrooms seem to be in an annex that is connected by long elevated walkway at third floor level.  Hence if you are in a second or first floor room, you have two lift journeys (up and down again) and a long old walk in between each time you go to your room or back.  Doesn't sound much but after a couple of days grates a bit.
 
Food was fine but nothing special.   Breakfast buffet very standard but a bright comfortable room to eat in (if you can avoid the rather dark side room).   Bistro menu fairly limited and predictable so  you are likely to get a bit bored if staying for more than a day or two although I suspect most people don't.",4,2017,05,01
218,Fun at Punchestown  Races,"A large group of us stayed here for two nights whilst attending the Punchestown races.
Staff very friendly and efficient. Great size rooms. Breakfast and bar facilities/service terrific. We will be back next year!!",5,2017,05,01
218,Mary D'Ambrosio,"Stayed in Killashee House Hotel for the races with 30 friends from Cheltenham, had fantastic service really friendly staff and beautiful rooms.  Very close to Punchestown races, great entertainment after the races including lovely snacks while you're having a drink. 
Will definitely book again for races next year. 
Highly recommended ",5,2017,05,01
218,Worst meal ever,"32 euro for a tiny fillet steak, over cooked TWICE. Worst pepper sauce I've ever tasted, no cream or alcohol his just cheap vinegar. Staff only seem.to moan about problems in front of guests. Stairs to toilets off the reception filthy, toilets out dated. Nice big bed rooms but again out dated bathrooms. Exterior work needed on house as well. Not sure how they are hanging onto 4 stars",3,2017,05,01
218,Spa visit with no pampering!,"Arrived for spa treatment one morning with friends shown to locker room where we had to share lockers! One locker per two people. We were asked to change into robes and wait back at reception for treatments we sat in our robes people arrived at reception felt very exposed here. Had our treatments in lovely relaxing room good massage facial and head massage very relaxing. Afterwards show out to room where we were given sorbet no teas, coffee or juices only drink was tap water. We sat on chairs there were a few loungers also in the room afterwards we made our way downstairs to the pool where there was a hot and cold shower and steam room. There were 4 loungers only otherwise you sat on chairs. When finished back to changing room no hand soap or lotions (that are in the bathroom in the hotel) 2 showere had communal container with soap no individual shampoo or conditioner we had not brought any with us as we expected to be supplied with these as had a head massage so hair was in need of wash. Unfortunately there was no pampering at all we had when finished to drop robes and towels back to reception normally we would put in laundry basket in changing rooms needs to pamper clients more before we will be back. Had a lovely lunch afterwards in the main hotel",3,2017,04,27
218,Average hotel with much potential!,"Been with my family Easter Monday and Tuesday to the Killashee Hotel. I did read the reviews quite throughly before I booked & friends had previously stayed there so was a tad apprehensive, but it's convenient to the Kildare Shopping Village which we were heading to. On arrival the receptionist wasn't overly 'delighted' to welcome us but that wasn't really an issue for me! Now trying to find the room is another matter.....as the reviews said this place is a complete maze...... the strangest layout I have ever come across!! You seem to walk and walk and walk, up in lifts down in lifts.....before you arrive at your room. You don't want to be needing your room in a hurry!! The leisure facilities are outside the main hotel so after you walk around the 'maze' trying to find the door which leads outside you have to walk across the car park rain, hail or snow to get to the Spa and Swimming pool!! I called reception on Monday evening to find out what time the swimming pool opened in the morning for ourselves & our teenagers (17,15,12) and was told 6.30am. We arrived at pool reception at 7.30am to be told ""sorry no kids in pool till 9am"", I explained I had called reception the evening before to clarify but was told they must not know the pool opening times!! So I had to return across the freezing cold car park back thru the maze with 2 disappointed teens. The upside to this hotel is the gardens.... they are really nice like a little miniature Powerscourt! Very friendly gardener, gave us some history of the hotel which was most interesting ...the most friendly of all the staff. The hotel bedrooms and endless corridors are in a 'tired' state needing a good refurb, although I did notice walking past some rooms that they were more fresher looking than the one we were in. We went into Naas one night for dinner and after consulting TA we went to a lovely Chinese restaurant called Mr Lin's .... really good 😊. There was a Nathan Carter concert on in the adjoining building which I wondered about the noise and hoards of ladies arriving but it never affected us at all and no noise at all. Concert goers were not allowed to use reception area for access to concert which was great. Would I return to the Killashee??...... perhaps if it's had some work done and at a more modern standard, which I believe is in the pipeline. ",3,2017,04,26
218,Deluxe double,"Stayed here for three nights for a family wedding in a deluxe double room. Room was lovely and spacious with a great bathroom however the paint in the bedroom looked like it hadn't been properly finished.
Service was great, special thanks to Mag who waited on our table during the wedding for her amazing attention to detail and to the children of the wedding party where she excelled in managing the expectations of little people.
 The food was amazing, both in the bistro and the wedding meal ( probably the best wedding food I have experienced to date). 
However, for a luxury hotel the breakfast really lets this hotel down. The standard did. not match the price. It is on par with any budget chain hotel I have ever stayed at, a well known German supermarket has better sausages and bacon! Service was chaotic, with staff milling around and having to be prompted to order food off the menu. Such a pity. Would not pay for B&B in this hotel again.",4,2017,04,25
218,Fantastic place and will be back again,"The hotel is beautiful and staff are great.
Chandeliers everywhere! 
 
Room was spacious )could have done with a minibar and TV a bit on the small side but we spent our time with the children around the grounds of the hotel.

The gardens are really nice here. The leisure complex has the biggest gym set that i have ever seen and nice pool with 2 saunas, 2 steam rooms and 2 Jacuzzis !! They also have a shallow pool for the kids.

Dinner was good and the breakfast was excellent.

Kids enjoyed getting the stamps on their Killashee passport and the movie in the kids club was a fairly recent one.

If i had it say one thing, it is that the hotel is very spreadout and the bedroom was about 10 minutes walk through the hotel - but there is nothing that the management can do about that.

Great job.",4,2017,04,22
218,A big dissapointment,"I travel to the area once per month so I know many hotels around and this one is at the very low level.
The first thing that impressed me is the weird design. I had to walk around 300 meters and take two lifts to reach my room.
I called The bistro to ask for a salad and they told me that they only had sandwiches but that they came with a salad. Sandwiches at Tesco are better than this one and the size of the salad was two spoonfuls.
An engine made noise all the night not allowing me to sleep. In the morning I went to reception and the guy told me that they were going to fix it. I returned in the evening and the noise was still there. I contacted reception again and another guy moved me to another room, a very big one in a corner. Then I realised that it had little holes and spots on the wall. And it was freezing, it had two radiators in the room and an extra fan in the bathroom.
I went to The Bistro and I asked for the Mac and cheese (what can go wrong with a nice homemade Mac and cheese?) It wasn't homemade! I expected a golden crispy one with melting cheese. No, it was a kind of thick soup of maccaroni. 
Breakfast, many 2 stars hotels give better breakfast. Don't expect variety of fruit, only pineapple, melon and watermelon, two different yogurts, cheap sliced bread, dried and tepid pancakes. 
Second night at The Bistro, the sirloin stake was fine but it took 40 minutes to come. I wanted to order dessert and another drink but I gave up after twenty minutes of waiting, I left the table and my empty plate stayed there.
The gym is OK and the pool is very big but you can have better SPA installations in hotels nearby for the same price.
On Thursday after walking all the way to my room, I discovered that the card was disabled so I had to walk all the way back to get it enabled, no explanation about why this happened.
I ordered for food in the room and I specially requested a bucket of ice. I wasn't surprised when it didn't come. I had to call them back and ask for it.
Too many mistakes.
The hotel looks tired in some areas and only the main house looks nice. The rest are very utilitarian blocks that shows the former functions of this estate: school and prison.
There is lack of staff and many of them are very young and don't show any interest in what they do.",2,2017,04,21
218,Fab fortieth ,"Just back from an overnight stay here in two deluxe doubles which seemed freshly decorated for my aunties 40th, huge rooms with two separate double beds, a combination of modern grey fabrics & walls and dark wood furnishings and a neutral carpet was simple and elegant staff were helpful from
Start to finish with accommodating us with a beautifully done birthday plate on arrival and a late check out today. My only issue was the room was a little cold. Beds were firm and really comfortable.
  
The bathroom was small but fine if not quite as nice. Shower over the bath that was lovely and strong although we showered late and the water wasn't hot. Plenty of Paul Costello toiletries and towels. 

The pool was simply decorated with a hot tub, sauna and steam room. Towels a locker key and swimming hat provided.

We ate in the bistro last night
And initially thought it was a little pricey but when the food came out we could see why. The fish and chips was fresh and huge and the chips were really chunky and fluffy. The burger was also fab. We all had dessert and loved it, my raspberry creme brûlée with sorbet and biscotti was amazing and my group loved theirs too.

We attended an event and went to the bar after with live entertainment it was quite busy so we initially had to sit out of the action down the back until people left. Lovely bar and staff made my mam non alcoholic cocktails no problem.

We got room service toasted sandwiches when we went back to our room and Andrew was very helpful on the phone and sent a note wishing me a happy 40th and details on local discounts for guests of the hotel. 

Breakfast was served in the restaurant which is beautifully decorated - very opulent. Nice buffet selection of hot and cold foods with homemade pastries and even pancakes on offer. We opted for the a la carte breakfast and had eggs Benedict which was lovely but the eggs were more cooked than I prefer.

We had a walk around the grounds before leaving which are also gorgeous.

Lovely stay would love to go back.

 

",5,2017,04,18
218,Fantastic all round hotel,"My partner and I took the children away for the Easter break, the staff are lovely, rooms are spacious, hotel tastefully decorated, food good and they had an added bonus of having a kids club from 6-9 every night which the children loved. The hotel give the children a passport when they check in and they have to get stamps at the different places they explore around the hotel massive grounds, our boys loved every min of our stay and we will definitely be returning in the near future. I would definitely recommend the killashee hotel...enjoy.
",5,2017,04,18
218,Overnight ,"Recently overnighted for a business meeting. 
Venue is fantastic with beautiful gardens and a majestic hotel on the grounds. 
Accommodation was fantastic and well kept.  Wifi through out was brilliant. Good food in the hotel bar and reasonable for this location. Very nice staff in the bar and very attentive. 
Recommend a visit. ",5,2017,04,15
218,Expected more,"We went here for complete relaxation. That we did not really get. The hotel itself is very attractive from the outside and looks like it should incorporate everything for that special stay. When walking to our room we discovered that they were putting new carpets down in the rooms which meant that most doors in our corridor were open, some having all the furniture of the other rooms crammed into them. On the second evening of our stay we had to move a roll of underlay to leave our room. I just felt that this work could have all been done more discreetly. As the hotel was quiet, maybe they could have put all guests in one area when work was been done on another. We did mention this on check out and the receptionist said she would inform housekeeping. Personally I would see it more as a supervisors job to make sure when the work is finished that the area is presentable again. Also the loud banging from the work took away from our plan of relaxation. 
The gym is fab and the pool also very nice. The hydrotherapy suite was good but it one of the showers weren't working and some of the jets within the pool also didn't work. I did really enjoy my treatments and the relaxation room. Breakfast had a lot of selection. The granola and fruit was beautiful but the hot food was quite dried up, especially the pancakes and eggs. I therefore chose to give them a miss on our second morning.  One thing we really missed from a previous stay was the little ""Snug Bar"". We asked in Jack's bar about this and the barman seemed genuinely as disappointed this had been closed to the public as we were. It was one of our fondest memories from our previous stay. Overall I was quite disappointed with our stay as I had such high expectations. The hotel has great potential but the little things that make good hotels great are missing and sadly I wouldn't choose to return in the near future.",3,2017,04,13
218,"Accommodating Staff, Comfy Bed, Interesting Building","Well, first off, it is a very interesting building and it is sitting in its own private garden.
In terms of location wise, it is definitely not a very accessible place as it is far away from Naas town and all the restaurants. However, since the building is interesting, it sort of balance out.
The entrance is somewhat below expectation, what with many crow nest in the tree opposite the entrance, leading to bird dropping everywhere and the smell that comes with it.
The reception does seem understaffed (1 staff for most of the time) and very busy. Service inevitably took a hit. I arrived around 10am and the room is not ready yet. So I said at the counter that I will go and grab something to eat first. I went straight to the bistro that I saw on the way in. However, was informed by staff at the Bistro that they only serve food at 12pm, and directed me to the breakfast area. Was disappointed that staff at reception didn't direct me to the correct place.However, staff at breakfast area was helpful to this sad (due to baggage delay from flight) and hungry person.
Finally got a room at 120. To get to room 120, I need to go up 1 level from reception area, walk to the other building, and go down 3 levels and walk to the end of the building. Quite a weird design.
With regards to the room itself, there are 2 large bed which is a welcoming sight. Bed is quite comfortable. Although the blanket is slightly on the heavier side. The television cabinet however, seemed to be broken as I can clearly see where the door of the cabinet should be, but the door is missing. I also had a hard time trying to locate the hair dryer on the first day.
The breakfast is not bad, although it is the same spread everyday.
For the food at bistro, the thai  curry is not bad. Steak is average. But then again, I am comparing the steak to what I have at the next hotel that I am staying in, which is a more expensive restaurant.
There are people maintaining the garden, but I will not say it is much to shout about.",4,2017,04,12
218,Afternoon tea,"First time visiting kilashee. It is a beautiful building with very picturesque grounds. Parking on site. Afternoon tea is in a gorgeous, bright and welcoming room. We were there as part of a hen party.during the afternoon. No hen parafenalia is allowed but this is understandable. Staff were friendly. Afternoon tea itself was lovely and there was loads for everyone. Gluten free and vegetarian preferences were also catered for really well. We had a lovely time and I would definitely return. The only thing I would mention is that staff seemed very much under pressure and they could have done with a few extra members of staff",4,2017,04,09
218,Expected more,Stayed for one night as nothing special about the hotel. The room was clean and basic and would rate this hotel as a low 3 star as the room was tired and so was the bathroom. Getting to my room was a maze as not sure who designed the hotel but getting two lifts to your room as was quicker walking given the confusion of the room. The signs are in English as saw other non english speaking guests trying to find their room as this needs to be addressed. Left my breakfast menu on the door at midnight and no sign of breakfast for 7/7.30 so rang down and not on the list. Checked the door and menu card still on the door. Rang down and breakfast arrives 20 mins later and did not eat as was in a rush to go to a meeting. Had dinner in the bar area as food ok but service is very  poor as ordered a  meal and the entree came 35mins after ordering then waited another 50mins for my main as the food is pricy so would expect much better service. Overall have stayed in better hotels with lower star rating as this hotel is not value for money and I would only rate this hotel as a good 2 star and 1 star for service. From the outside looks old charm and the foyer and bar area are all up to modern standard and from their on in the standard and service goes down hill which is a shame. For business or leisure will not stay in this hotel as much better options.,3,2017,04,08
218,Beautiful Hotel ,"Stayed here recently with a large group for one night. Check in was relatively quick considering the amount of people we had to check in. Room was fabulous 2 large king size beds and bathroom was well stocked. Breakfast was fab the next morning although try to get in early as when we left there was a queue. The bar staff were friendly and the cocktails were lovely. If Bihar one compliant it would be where our rooms were. We had a lot of luggage with us and to get to our room you had to get up one flight of stairs and then down another two or take two different elevators which were not working  when we checked out the following morning. Otherwise fabulous hotel, grounds were beautiful. Would definitely return.",4,2017,04,07
218,Great hotel,"Stayed here for a conference, very well run however staff constantly walked through the room which was very distracting. The room was lovely and the hotel itself was full of little rooms off the main lobby. Breakfast was understaffed and there was a wait for cereal bowels and orange juice one of the mornings.
 The grounds were lovely but I didnt get to the leisure club. Food in The Bistro was really good.
I would happily stay again and hopefully find The Snug next time",4,2017,04,06
218,Fawlty Towers Experience ,"Just back from an overnight stay in Killashee. Check in was prompt & efficient, got keys and made our way to the room only to find a man fast asleep in the bed when we entered the room!! Needless to say I got the fright of my life and retreated quickly back to reception baffled as to how this could happen & very embarrassed as the overnight stay was a gift for my travel companion. Reception apologised and gave me new keys for a different room. The porter escorted us to the room this time and I let him enter the room first just in case.  Was slightly disappointed with the room as I had received a call from the hotel the day before our visit offering me a complimentary upgrade to a suite which I accepted. The room with the strange man in it was a suite but the replacement room wasn't. And therein lies the issue I believe, whoever offered me the upgraded suite obviously didn't check it was actually available! As I didn't want our check in experience to tarnish the rest of our stay we decided to make the most of it. Dinner in Turners restaurant was beautiful with excellent service throughout. Breakfast the next morning was also delicious and again the wait staff were fantastic. Beautiful hotel and lovely gardens. Reception apologised last night when I had to call back to the desk to find out what had happened at check in, I think the very least they could have done was take the initiative and contact me to explain. I would have expected a hotel of this standard would have made some effort to make up for their very obvious mistake at check in but no, nothing even though management were made aware of the issue. ",4,2017,04,02
218,Girls night away ,"I visited the hotel with a group of friends, our room was gorgeous, really spacious and bed was so comfortable. 
Dinner was lovely, wine very tasty, their was a large queue for breakfast the next morning but we were seated and served very quickly. 
Check in and out was very quick despite it being very busy. 
The thermal suite could use a bit of a revamp in particular the changing rooms. 
We are already planning our next trip back. ",4,2017,04,01
218,Spa Escape,"Treated my mother and sister to a spa escape for my Mother’s Birthday in February. 
Check in took ages.  I asked to confirm our dinner reservation for that evening, to which they had no record of, even though I called twice that week to change the time and to confirm to the hotel it was for a Birthday celebration. They had no record of this either. We eventually got checked in after having to speak to a member of management. We had 2 spa treatments each as part of our package. When we arrived at the spa we were all taken in separate directions. We were not shown the facilities or the changing rooms.  The spa was packed, the noise was unbearable. After we eventually found each other (we were all shown different places to wait).  The relaxation room was so packed we couldn’t get a seat. I felt like I was on a construction site during one of my treatments there was so much banging going on. It was by far the worst spa experience I have ever had. I would not recommend this place to anyone.  A really disappointing experience.",1,2017,03,31
218,Happy conference guest,I had a great time at a conference here. I even forgot something it the room and it was easy to contact and get a hold of the staff to return it in a prompt and professional matter. Thank you Carine! The leisure facility was 'kitted out' great to stay at a hotel with a reasonable Gym and Pool. Well done Killashee!,4,2017,03,30
218,One night stay,"I stayed here for one night recently as my fiance had a tourism event nearby to attend. The hotel is very beautiful, on approach it resembles a small castle, and looks very charming and luxurious. 
I loved the attention to detail with the flower displays outside the entrance, and the vintage bicycle etc.
Upon entrance it didnt disappoint either, it has a luxury feel with all its chadeliers.
Checkin was smooth and fast and we were informed that breakfast was included in the rate.
The hotel has an unusual layout, and for some rooms you may have to get 2 lifts. This wasnt an issue for us, but I would suggest if an elderly person is booking to request a room closer to reception.
The bedroom itself felt slightly dated, but this is to be expected as it is an old building. The bed however was new and modern and large and comfortable. The room itself was quite spacious too.
Breakfast in the morning was nice, there was lots of choice in the hot and cold buffets, but you could also choose from the made to order menu at no extra cost. The dining area was luxurious.
As my fiance was away working all day, and I had little to do, I asked at the desk if they could accomodate a late checkout and to my delight they allowed me to stay in the room until 1pm. 
After checkout I explored the gardens which are well worth a walk even in bad weather. There is a beautiful butterly garden, and a fairy trail for children with a play area. The grounds offer plenty romantic strolls and I think it would be blissful for a couple to wander in the summer months.
The location of the hotel is great, its only 4km from Punchestown Racecourse if you are thinking of a trip to the races, and for the likes of the shopaholics such as me yesterday, it is a 20 minute drive from the Kildare Villlage Outlet center.
I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wishes to attend something in the area.",4,2017,03,30
218,Great location,"Killashee hotel is a lovely location for a quiet weekend or mid-week break. Quite easy to get to and just a short distance outside Naas town. Hotel reception gave simple and easy to follow directions to help us get to Kildare Village.
The hotel foyer was warm and welcoming with a beautiful open fire and lots of comfortable sofas to rest on after our drive to the hotel.
We found the room to be very clean, warm and restful. We dined in the hotel Bistro restaurant and the food was excellent with a good range of meal choices on the menu. Service was quick and friendly.
There's a short walk through the well kept grounds and a Leisure Spa on the complex. It should be noted that the Spa isn't connected directly to the hotel and guests need to cross a car-park to reach the Spa.",5,2017,03,30
218,Amazing Location,"Beautiful Hotel, beautiful location.
I would love to go back with my family soon!
Food was gorgeous and the function room nice.
The restaurant service was a little bit slow but I think they were changing shifts, but anyway, it is a thumbs up hotel.",4,2017,03,29
218,Lovely Mother's Day Visit,Arranged a high tea with my brother as a Mother's Day treat. Food was lovely and service attentive. Left with a goodie box (which my brother promptly dropped on the way out - oh well). Couldn't have asked for any more really - mum felt special and I was delighted to treat her so we all left very happy.,5,2017,03,28
218,High Tea on Mothers Day,"My daughter arranged high tea for thee yesterday for Mothers Day and it was such a lovely treat. Despite being really busy they did a great job. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were treated like royalty. The staff were really on their game- friendly, efficient and charming. The selection of goodies was excellent and beautifully presented. Credit where it's due to all concerned. Top marks.",5,2017,03,27
218,Spa and lunch,"Arrived March 24th booked for 10:30 Spa, had coffee first in fabulous room in hotel very friendly staff, high ceilings marble floors oozing luxury.The Spa itself a bit away from the hotel but not a problem staff here very welcoming and professional, we had 90 minutes in hydrotherapy suite then 2 treatments.Shian i think was the therapist i had and i must say she was brilliant-so relaxing afterwards brought to relaxation suite and i could honestly have stayed there forever TOTAL relaxation but alas time came for us to go
Had lunch back in hotel fabulous food would highly recommend this place well done to all staff",5,2017,03,24
218,Missleading,"My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights last weekend.
My initial thoughts were the pictures and description were very misleading. Weddings prevented us from using anywhere but the bar to drink our (grossly overpriced) wine. The food at the bistro wasn't great.
Then we discovered we didn't have hot running water for the first 18 hours of our stay. It was fixed but nothing else-I had to ask to take the spa bill (whopping €20) off as we just had to go to an outbuilding (spa) and public gym to shower).
The bed was huge but the bed sheets shoddy. 
The food in the restaurant was good. The staff were nice. 
The gardens and woodland are laughable-they barely exist and are certainly nothing to boast about. 
All in all a really disappointing weekend.  A very expensive, disappointing weekend.

Will not go back.  In fact will actively encourage people not to go. ",2,2017,03,24
218,Not as good as it was,"Been here many times and usually it's ok but this time not so great.
Reception wasn't properly staffed let me down a little.
No hot breakfast buffet today so had to wait a while didn't get offered hot food.
When your in a rush that's no good.
Made me a little late.
I'd give t another go though.
",2,2017,03,23
218,Good & Bad,"The hotel has beautiful grounds but the back where the spa is looks a bit old and run down, the lay out to find rooms is a bit confusing but staff are ready to help. 

Upon arrival reception staff were lovely and had acknowledged my birthday in the room with some truffles, lovely. 

We had some problems with having no hot water on the Friday night, left it a while after having a cold shower thought maybe the heating system was on at certain times but tried again that night and still freezing, phoned down to reception and we were told it could not be looked at until morning. Very mannerly on the phone but obviously we couldn't shower so that was a let down. 

I phoned again in the morning as the water still wasn't on, reception said they would phone for maintenance, fine we went off to have breakfast. 

Breakfast was fine. Service wasn't, tea was very weak, one tea bag in a large pot, hard to get waitresses attention, I asked a lady or tried to for an extra tea bag and she was rude, she ignored me pretending she couldn't hear me and then when I spoke louder said in a minute and walked off into the kitchen. I understand staff are busy but that was rude. 

I asked another young girl and she was more than happy to help and was great. 

When we left breakfast I checked again with reception and they said it was a bigger problem, suggested we could shower in a different room or use the leisure facilities, I asked could we move room as this wasn't really acceptable we hadn't had a shower yet. The lady on reception was lovely she said it would be no problem to leave it with her as it was busy the night before. So we went back to the room. 

The maintenance man arrived and asked when we would be leaving so he could check the room, it was lashing rain outside and still early morning so we wouldn't be leaving, we let him work away whilst we were there but to be honest it was a bit uncomfortable, he was lovely but that is slightly unprofessional in my opinion. He managed to fix the shower after half an hour or so, although reception never bothered to ring and confirm if this was ok, or confirm that we didn't need a room change or even a phone call to let us know they needed in to fix it would have been good. 

Food was excellent, both in the bar and in the restaurant, the bar was hard to get table service so we had to walk up to pay on Friday, no atmosphere or music which was disappointing as it was st Patrick's day. 

I had a spa treatment on the Saturday, it was excellent and the girls brilliant very professional and informative. 

Saturday night was in the restaurant the staff were lovely and friendly and food was great. 

Music in the bar on Saturday night was great too. 

Sunday morning we had requested breakfast in our room, it didn't arrive on the selected time slot so I had phoned down, assured it would be sent up, the restaurant phoned back to the room to say they hadn't the order. It was all sorted out quickly and mannerly but again it left us waiting and enquiring and re-ordering.

As you can see, it had its ups and downs. Perhaps bad communication with staff, although we spent €700 over the weekend. To not be offered any compensation for having a freezing cold shower is disappointing. Bad manners in the restaurant is also unacceptable. 

I have worked in hospitality I understand the pressure sometimes I have worked breakfast myself but that was just rude. At the very least find the customer after ignoring then saying in a minute? 

I can appreciate the hotel was busy, but it was for a special occasion, we spent a considerable amount of money. I expected more. 

",3,2017,03,19
218,Another great stay,"We discovered this gem of a hotel by chance 5 years ago and have returned every year since.
Only writing a review now as I am over whelmed by how better our stay keeps getting.
We have stayed in a different room each time and I cannot fault any of them.
The customer service you receive from walking through the door is something they should be so proud of.It has that ""cead mile failte"" vibe without coming across false,like in so many other hotels.The team at reception are so welcoming and this extended to all staff we came across. 
We dined in The Bistro.Food was delicious and the service was relaxed and friendly.
A huge thank you to Andrew,reception,housekeeping and dining staff.
Thank you for another PERFECT stay.

218,Very nice hotel,"In a nutshell..Book a suite if staying here in the main house..its great value for money and amazing view of gardens..afternoon tea is really nice the room is so pretty and it's were breakfast is served..breakfeast was lovely too..food in the bistro was really really nice.. leisure centre is huge clean and warm..special mention to guy on reception in leisure centre he's an absolute gent...waiting staff are pleasant..keep in mind theat this is a busy hotel and you may have to wait for drinks ECT but it's worth it.also staff are under pressure at times but in general quite pleasant...and when making reservation check if thermal suite is available to use as we were told it was fully booked for 6 weeks would have liked to have been informed of that when booking anitially..like any hotel if you look for problems you find them but if you want a value for money, comfortable romantic hotel with good food and nice atmosphere  that's what you get here..we will definitely return soon...",4,2017,03,17
218,Amazing,"Stayed for one night with few friends, everything about this hotel is amazing, the Staff, food and spa... Great value for money.
Interior is very impressive and clean.
Thank you very much, will definitely come back 👍🏻",5,2017,03,14
218,Beautiful Hotel - great value deal,"The Killashee is a beautiful hotel, with a real sense of grandeur as soon as you see it.  The drive up to, and entering the hotel gives the immediate impression that this is a lovely old hotel, and you are going to be spoiled.  I was staying only a single night, and was pleased to find this property with a fairly good online price (via Expedia), and thought I'd look a little closer.  I am glad I did, as on checking the hotels own site had a bed//breakfast/dinner deal that was £107 for a night, and then had a 10% discount code that was valid for March.  So, that was my entire night sorted for a single price, a little pricey for a normal stay, but a real treat.

Check-in was smooth.   The room was a little more disappointing, set right at the back of the property (with a strange journey to the third floor a small walk then a lift down to the ground floor).  The room was enormous, and well appointed, but was just a vanilla hotel room with lots of dark red fabrics and dark brown wood furniture.  It was very nice, but not quite as great as the look/feel of the front of the hotel.  The dinner in the Bistro was excellent, with lovely service, and I happily paid the £10 supplement to have steak as part of my 3-course meal deal.

Breakfast was probably the most disappointing part of the stay, with a near empty (three tables) dining room, and two serving staff, I was not overly happy with having to wait over 5 minutes at the ""please wait to be seated"" sign.  Then the waitress asked me if I wanted tea or coffee, after telling (and correcting her when she kept checking I wanted coffee) that I tea three times, she still brought out coffee.  Then, eggs benedict was over-cooked/hard-boiled and the sauce was way too vinegary.. what a sin!!  But, it may have just been a one-off, but wasn't a great experience.  

Breakfast aside, this is a lovely place, with nice staff.  Thoroughly recommended.",5,2017,03,14
218,Bad Christmas Party,"Food was terrible no choice for out tables even though we had 4 out of 9/10 tables.
other tables were given menu options staff were nice but as for trying to find your room with no explanation from reception on how to get to it was a night mare my husband and i had to go in separate directions and telephone one another if we found our room. much the same for the function room at one point of the night i had to help a BRIDE find her way back to her  wedding from the toilets. the car parks are extremely tight as are the roads leading to the hotel and no lighting in them either",1,2017,03,14
218,Fantasic catering for Confirmation party and lovely overnight stay,"We had our daughters confirmation party in Ledger room this weekend and we stayed that night. We had a wonderful time. The area given to us was perfect and very comfortable for all the young guests we had with us. We got lots of personal, friendly attention from the waiting staff. They were fantastic and couldn't do enough for us. The food choice was perfect. We worked off the bistro lunch menu which is reasonably priced for the quality of the food and lovely presentation. We were made to feel very welcome to stay as long as we wanted at our tables. We stayed that night in a family room which is very spacious. Loved the decor and sense of atmosphere in the hotel. Too many hotels in modern buildings now all doing the same job and looking the same. For a family friendly hotel, this is really lovely and very different to run of the mill fare which we would have had in a hotel in wexford two weeks ago and paid a lot more!!!! Thanks everyone. You are all doing a great job.",5,2017,03,12
218,"Lovely hotel, excellent service ","We stayed here last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The hotel is spotless and well aired.  The rooms are lovely and the hotel is a cost temperature.  The lifts are a little confusing but that's due to it being a listed building so it can't be helped.  We'd dinner in Turners restaurant where the service was impeccable!  At €45 per head, the menu is appealing and the food was tasty, especially the desserts!  Amuse bouches were served along with beautiful chocolates as Petit Fours and really good coffee!  We'd eaten earlier in the Bistro which I found a little more pricy but nice decor.  The breakfast was excellent with a great selection including eggs Benedict which I highly recommend - delicious!!  Overall we enjoyed our stay here and recommend it.",5,2017,03,12
218,High class but..,"Had good impression when we first arrived. Check-in staff very helpful. Room was spacious and the view was superb. Adequate in room services. The room location was somewhat like a maze that we had to take 2 lifts just to go to the 4th floor from the reception. Nevertheless it is wheelchair friendly. Breakfast was superb, plenty of options and delicious worthy of 4 *.  The only disappointing feature of this place for us was their leisure ctr. A total letdown compared to other hotels we've been throughout ireland and Europe. First, we were told wrongly of the closing time where we had to argue just to waddle our kids in where hotel reception said at 6.45pm but the girl at leisure ctr said at 6pm instead. After we got in at 6.10pm, low and behold there were families still swimming..??? Secondly, went on a Sunday morning, Half of adult pool closed for swimming lanes, left us with another half where half of it closed for swimming lessons. We might as well go to public pool. Overall hotel stay 4* and leisure ctr from pool perspective 2*. If pool facilities you're looking for over the weekend, strongly advise this place is not the place to go....",4,2017,03,10
218,Had a wedding here,"Had a wedding in Killashee.
Everybody who came to the wedding seems like they enjoyed our wedding. My family loved the building.
Staffs were friendly and worked quite hard until the end of the wedding. Dinner was good enough.

Only thing .. that we could not understand was.. we could not get to sleep in the bridal sweets... I think there were kinda miss communication between the staffs.
First staff just put us to the room which was not a bridal sweet. 
We found out after the wedding that it was not the bridal sweet that we slept on last night of the wedding because we received wedding gifts and staffs told us that they are going to move the wedding gifts to our room but when the wedding was over and we went to our room, there were no single gifts. 
We asked the other staff where are our gifts and they said its in our room ... which totally did not make sense and we had a conversation for like 10 minutes and we realized that we were placed in the wrong room.

Overall experience was great. Staffs were friendly, organizer was working hard. Just I wish we were in the bridal sweet.",4,2017,03,08
218,good and bad,"We travelled for spa package and stayed two nights.  Spa treatments very good but the relaxation room lacks atmosphere. Needs more refreshments l.e. fruit teas lemon and ice in the water provided. There were boxes piled just inside the door behind the kitchen area ????
The hotel is beautiful. Staff excellent although all very young. Delux room beautiful.
The restaurant was closed Thursday evening so we ate in the Bistro. We had Lunch there also for convenience. We did not like the bistro. There were set menus and not a choice of food for us.The bar was part of the same area but no comfortable seating.
I would have liked a small area even a room where one could order a drink or a cream tea and regular sandwiches. These things have not gone out of date and it should not cost euro 13 for a lunchtime sandwich. I understand these are personal choices.The cream coloured seating in the bistro beside the fire are filthy. The table mats at lunchtime felt grubby. The restaurant was open for breakfast and was beautiful. The food again not 100% 
Overall we loved the building and staff and the grounds and even the spa.
It could be so much more.",4,2017,03,08
218,Made the Mistake of asking for a coffee,"Went there for a Coffee in the main Hotel, and the service was truly awful.

We entered the lounge area March 2017, and the lad behind the bar had his back to us when we went in, and continued for many mins, when I coughed and asked for a coffee, his shoulders dropped and he went ""Ok, if you must, 4 Euros"", took the money off me and walked off, 10 mins later according to my watch, I asked one of the young girls who had appeared to please get me the coffee, and she went off in a completely different direction, in the meantime our barman appeared carrying a bottle of wine - didn't even look at us.

I asked him where the coffee was and he just shrugged his shoulders, muttered something and walked off. 

5 Mins later the girl appeared carrying said coffee - stone cold

The Spa is excellent, the service in the Hotel, Dire.The staff in the Hotel cannot be bothered",1,2017,03,03
218,Our Wedding,"We held our Wedding here at the end of September last year in the Original House. We were so happy we chose Killashee, the staff were just amazing and couldn't have done more for us. They really went above and beyond and had everything in hand which made our experience so much better. There was literally nothing to worry about even when I had a disaster with my dress the morning of the wedding due to a let down with the alterations company.  They sorted it out for me, I don't know what I would have done without their help.  
Andrew and Katie were brilliant to deal with and have there on the day, but really every person who worked there that we came into contact with really made a lasting impression. 
The day itself ran smoothly, the food was amazing and we had such good feedback from guests on all elements of the day, and on the hotel itself.",5,2017,03,03
218,Very Disappointing Never to Return.,"Our Visit last Friday evening we was so disappointed.
Restaurant food was not up to scratch I could not eat my Dry Aged Steak . I order Very Rare Streak and it was so tough it was almost in eddabe and was returned...
The Room was the most Ugy we have ever had to stay in Given the cost we expected a lot better.
The breakfast did not live up to expectations.
We will not be returning.
Very disappointed Customer's
This venue will not be on the Re-Visit List.",1,2017,02,28
218,A REAL QUAINT HOTEL,"This is heaven, well close anyway as it is a former convent turned into a fantastic hotel. You leave reception and take a lift to the second floor and pass the Gallery Bar on your way to your room, turn left after the bar and then right into another lift and go to the first floor where your room awaits you. Our room was splendid, large and bright room and tea and coffee making facilities. The food was exception on our two evenings in the dining room. It was great to see experienced staff at work, and this is an exceptional restaurant. The wine list is compact and our wine was very good. We had car parking close to the entrance, and there is a butterfly garden which we did not visit as the day was damp. we didn't see any nuns there, but boy would they enjoy the food and drink. thank you for a wonderful two days.",5,2017,02,24
218,"Amazing Spa, disappointed with the hotel/staff in restaurant.","It was my first time to visit the Killashee Spa with my sisters in Feburary and our experience was amazing! From the moment we arrived we were taken care of by the most friendly staff. We spent time in the hydro pool before having a collegian facial and could not fault the whole experience as we will definitely be visiting this Spa again very soon. A big thanks to Jessica and the girls as it was fabulous.
We then went over to the hotel to have food and drinks as it was my sisters birthday and we thought it would be a nice way to end the day. We were brought to our table and the lady in charge gave us a dinner menu and walked away, never to appear at out table again! After about 10 min we tried in vane to get someone's attention to order a drink or even have a look at the wine menu and no luck! The restaurant was not busy on the night and plenty of staff on so really could not understand why we were being ignored! When we did eventually get to speak too someone we asked if my sister (who is celiac) could have a steak or could she speak to the chef for something suitable as she did not like anything on the menu. We were told what is on the menu is it! Really expect more from a 4 star hotel, quiet shocked! We called a taxi to bring us into Kildare town to another restaurant. Will not be going back to this restaurant or hotel, but will definitely return to the Spa.",3,2017,02,23
218,Great spa getaway,"We went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the staff upgraded our room to the biggest suite on the floor which was very nice! We also had 3 hour spa package which was excellent. Plus a short drive from Dublin, i would definitely go back.",5,2017,02,22
218,Romantic Night ,"We stayed at Killashee House for one night with a view to visiting Kildare Village and The National Stud. 

The entrance to the House and the gardens are definitely a moment for pause as well as an impressive exterior. 

We settled in and had a pre dinner drink before taking a meal in the Bistro. I must say all the staff were extremely polite from check in to check out. 

The hotel itself is unusual I must admit and it took awhile to warm up to it. While parts of it have a presence of the old boarding school, you can almost imagine how this would have played out. Particularly in the older parts of the hotel. As you climb the stairs to see wooden plaques on the door with names embalzed such as Beatrix. This aspect makes the house unique. 

However I was not particularly fond of our room which was a little dated and left me some what disappointed as Killashee does elude a certain luxurious feel to it, the room did not live up to expectations. 
That said I had a wonderful nights stay, the bed was extremely comfortable, we both slept very well indeed. 

Breakfast was served in Turners Restaurant. It was a beautiful room with interesting decor. There was a fantastic choice and The Eggs Benedict was delightful. 

Check out was quick and efficient, the lady at the front desk asked us about our plans for the day, and when I mentioned we were going to visit Kildare Village she immediately gave us a card offering 10% discount and also looked up the opening times of The National Stud, this was a nice touch. 

Overall we both found the experience enjoyable. 

",4,2017,02,20
218,Excellent Hotel,The Killashee is an excellent location. It's facilities are superb with ample parking and a great spa and pool. The bedrooms were very good. We were using it for a family weekend and we had a range of rooms but all were of a great quality. We did't all use the spa but those who did enjoyed the facilities and we all enjoyed the swimming pool which was a weird shape but suitable for those who wanted to have a good swim in straight lines but there was a great children's pool separate from the main pool. The restaurant was extremely good with a good menu choice and the service was discreet but what was needed. The free wifi was much appreciated and the hotel was easily accessible from Dublin airport and by a short and reasonable taxi journey. Staff were all pleasant and helpful. I would certainly recommend it and hope to return before too long. The grounds are also wonderful with plenty of walks available.,5,2017,02,18
218,Half-Term break,"My husband and I took our girls here for a one night break. We arrived at 2 o'clock and settled in nicely into our very comfortable room. We then used the leisure facilities including the 25m pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. These were excellent. We had booked into bistro for dinner. The service was a little slow but the food was very good. ",5,2017,02,17
218,Perfect place for family,"We've stayed in a family room for three nights. The room was very spacious and the beds were very comfortable.
Staff were nice and very helpful too. The best part was the butterfly garden which is right next to the hotel building. It was so nicely decorated that my boy had a fantastic time exploring it.
Breakfast was average.",5,2017,02,17
218,just as good the second time,"this was our second time to stay in this beautiful hotel for a family summer break. on this visit we stayed in the junior suite it was lovely. the kids really loved having their own room. the food was great , we really enjoyed the pool. the staff were great and so helpful. can not wait for our next visit",5,2017,02,16
218,Pure Pampering,"A group of ladies spent a super overnight in this oasis only forty five minutes from Dublin. We had a ""set deal"" of treatments and as all six of us are well travelled ""spa""  tourists this one is so good. 
The individual attention was excellent and everything ran on time as each treatment followed on from each other. The ambience is so calm,  rest areas are well maintained , clean and spacious. After our therapies, swims and  teas, we had dinner in the delightful restored dining area of this  old Victirian school that once flourished here. Very good menu choices and again the service was excellent.
As this is a popular wedding venue, I would recommend a mid week overnight deal. Weather permitting take a stroll in the gorgeous gardens around the hotel and you might see a fairy peeping out from their ""tree doors""!",5,2017,02,16
218,Weekend away,We were at a wedding in Naas and the reception was in the Killashee Hotel so we booked to stay there for two nights.  It is a beautiful hotel with lovely grounds.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful and the rooms were fitted to a high standard.  The food in the restaurant was very good and the service was excellent.,5,2017,02,14
218,Business trip,"Hotel looks like it has been recently refurbished. Rooms are spacious and well equipped (really warm, even too warm to sleep in). Nice gardens at the back of the property. Bathroom contained separate bathtub and shower unit which I really like. Spa, swimming pool and gym are in the building across from the main hotel. ",4,2017,02,13
218,Suburb Accommodation. .......,"We attended a business gathering recently and although the room was exceptional with plenty of living space , And of a high standard....The prices charged in the Bar were equivalent to Temple street on a sat night......
The veg served with our beef were overcooked and soggy. I suppose with a large group it's may be difficult to get spot on, but that's the difference between  a good and Excellent experience. 
The porridge for breakfast was of a poor standard when no imagination on presentation or taste. It resembled glue....
The staff were fine although 1 guy working in the bar at the function was lost at sea....
The gym and pool area was excellent with staff attending to our needs.",3,2017,02,09
218,The most relaxing night we have had in years,"Where do i start:
1) the location, super close to Dublin but yet you feel like you are in the country side
2) the staff, everyone was helpful, thoughtful and friendly
3) the room! we felt like royalty due to the four poster bed and the amazing decor, plus the bath and shower were a great addition
4) the food :-) we genuinely havent eaten this well in a hotel in years. It was michelin star.
5) the bar, so relaxed and great live music!",5,2017,02,08
218,Character and Beautiful Grounds,"Visited with our grown-up family. Upgraded to a very nice  suite without having asked.Has the character of the old house/boarding school that it once was and grounds are magnificent. Hosting a wedding while we were there, but that did not take from our stay. Staff very friendly and efficient. Dined in the bar. Food nice but one serving rather cold. Stayed there for a few drinks after dinner. Found music a bit  loud. Fine pool and leisure centre.",4,2017,02,07
218,Brilliant for kids ,"Stayed here for 3 nights/ part of wedding party with 10 children

Very impressed by the whole experience 

Very well kitted for children. During the ceremony some of the kids were acting up and parents where able to go in the next room which was a play room and kept them entertained without disturbing ceremony. 

Staff where helpful as my son was always messing about, not listening like any other 2 year old. They where very understanding in that situation.

The bedrooms in the old house are beautiful, spacious and warm (too warm for my partner) and was able to open window to cool down. Also had an extra bedroom joined into the main bedroom for my children so me and my partner could relax in peace. Beautiful view for windows also.

Food was lovely and warm. Would like abit more of a option but not a compliant. And the woman who was the manager of the bar was so welcoming could just talk away to her all day. 

Overall 5 stars from my family as everyone enjoyed it ",5,2017,02,06
218,Relaxed Hotel,"I would describe the Killashee as a relaxed hotel . Our room overlooked the garden and it was warm comfortable and clean although a little dated.I especially appreciated the large soft bath towels , not always found in other hotels I have stayed in. We had two breakfasts  and one dinner in the hotel as part of a package deal and also had lunch on arrival . To my surprise the bistro was not the small and cosy venue I had imagined but was a very large space with lots of tables , people and noise( Sunday afternoon) and is obviously very popular with people living in the area. At one end of the bistro is the bar area but we found this uninviting as it only had high tables and chairs , not suitable for us . Instead we had our drinks in the reception area on comfortable settees and in front of a lovely log fire.The food in the bistro  was just average and breakfast was the same .The spa, gym  and pool are in a separate building and again very well used by those in the area . When we visited to check out the pool there appeared to be every kind of activity and class possible going on in a very lively atmosphere.The gardens around the hotel are pleasant especially the butterfly garden which looked good even on a damp January day.
The best thing about this hotel was the staff who were without exception warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble to them.",3,2017,02,05
218,NOT GREAT,"Myself and my fiance stayed here to get away from the stresses of work, kids and life in general....😂 As we walked into the reception we found it to be very cold and it was the same throughout the whole hotel even at dinner and in our room itself. Dinner in the bistro was very nice and recommended. As there was a wedding on that day and night our uninterrupted night got interrupted by other guests singing and shouting in the corridor. Good thing about the hotel was the staff. They couldn't have done enough for us, so helpful. So our one night get away wasn't so stress free.",3,2017,02,05
218,My new favourite hotel,"I stayed here with my partner as part of her 40th Birthday celebrations.  I had booked a Junior Suite and I was absolutely delighted with the quality of the room.  Most of the furnishings were a little dated, but I think that it was all in keeping with the hotel so no complaints there.  The main thing that impressed me was the size of the suite, it was just huge!  A lovely four poster bed and a jacuzzi bath just made it all the more special.  

We made use of the spa facilities which were very good, especially the Hydrotherapy pool and found the whole spa experience to be extremely relaxing.  The treatments were a little more expensive than I am used to in the UK, but I think that was more to do with the exchange rate than anything else. 

We booked dinner in the restaurant and we were both so impressed with the quality of the food, all of which was beautifully presented and cooked.  A couple of cocktails were also very welcome!

A full Irish breakfast in the morning coupled with a late check out made our stay very memorable and just perfect.",5,2017,02,01
218,Lovely wedding - rustic hotel ,"This was a lovely venue for the family wedding attended. There is a small garden perfect for pictures. The hotel rooms are huge and rustic. Whilst in places the building is ageing and could do with some touching up, overall there is a real rustic charm about this hotel. Would recommend for a small/medium sized wedding venue or pleasant nights stay. ",4,2017,01,30
218,Wedding Guests,"Attended a friends wedding here recently so the review is only based on the function room and the surrounds. The drinks reception was great and the canopes were tasty and plentiful. The function room for the wedding was intimate and looks like it can only cater for about 100 people. The food was really good but service was a little on the slow side - to be fair I think the room being at or just over capacity slowed down the wait staff. 

Sadly, the draught beer served in the function room was really really bad presumably due to the lack of use. The pint of Smithwicks I got was undrinkable and the Guiness was no better. I had to visit the main bar which was open to the public everytime I wanted another pint. Not a missive deal but a little inconvenient.

The bathroom arrangements for the wedding guests were very strange - it was unisex with two toilets (one didn't appear to have a light). I don't think the female guests were overly enamored with the set up and again tended to visit the facilities in the public bar. 

Overall, I did have a really good night and would recommend the venue for those planning a more intimate wedding reception.",3,2017,01,30
218,Hotel Steeped in History,This hotel has a very unusual history which made staying there better.  In 1961 it was going to be a women's prison and this was rejected to make it a Junior boarding school.  I doubt back then Kilashee would have been as luxurious as it is today.  Its has very interesting rooms and much of the original building is unchanged so there are unique aspects of the building which makes staying here interesting.  Food and service was good and bar facility was very nice.,4,2017,01,25
218,lovely break,Was a lovely 2 night break with a half day spa.Got a taxi into Naas the first night which was very prompt and driver was lovely. The room was very comfortable for the 3 of us. It was my daughter's Birthday and a lovely treat was waiting in the room for her. We had dinner in the restaurant the second night which was lovely and the staff sang happy birthday to the birthday girl. The staff were helpful and pleasant at all times.  Disappointed that the old house was not open and none of the reception rooms were in the old house. Would have loved a cup of coffee in that old world charm.,4,2017,01,24
218,staying in a castle for the good and for the bad,"You drive in to the Killashee and straight away are taken away by the fact that you will be staying in a castle!
Staff is quite friendly, the room are big and clean. However, there is nothing else special that would merit more discussion. 
Special mention to the gym, that is beside the property and it is one of the best that I have ever stayed in.
On the bad side, it is an old property. the rooms are big but there is a lot of wasted space, not well designed. The rooms also feel old, especially in the bathroom. Nothing to put you off from hotel, but don't expect the most modern luxury and design. It is a very flat hotel, meaning that you will have to walk for a bit to get from reception to your room. Finally if you don't have a car, the hotel is outside the city pretty isolated, it offers a good restaurant but I would imagine that it will get boring after a couple of days.",3,2017,01,23
218,Poor,"Decided to go here with my girlfriend for our anniversary. We booked into the spa for a 25minute treatment each. That was nice. Hydrotherapy pool is really just a warm pool with a few jets. Wasn't impressed. We called for a bucket of ice twice to the room from the bar for our champagne and it never arrived I had to eventually get it from the bar myself. The hotel was cold by 10pm with the big fireplace empty. We later found out that two drinks had been ordered for us from a friend over the phone and to be brought to our table after dinner and that never happened. (We found out after our friend rang us after the stay). 

Staff were nice and we had a good time but the service could have been a lot better. It's a big old building and would be nice to have the fires lit at night. 

Wouldn't stay again. Wouldn't recommend. ",2,2017,01,22
218,A poor experience for a family with toddlers,"I don't normally write negative reviews about hotels but I am doing so in the hope that it draws the hotels' attention to some areas that could be improved upon so other families in the future will have a better experience than we did.

We chose Kilashee for a short holiday with our 2 year old twin toddlers as, from looking at the website, we believed it to be a hotel attuned to the needs of a young family. Unfortunately this was not the case and throughout the duration of our stay we consistently felt that families were ‘down the pecking order’ with weddings and New Year functions taking a clear priority. Examples of this included:

-	Being informed by reception that the Duplo Room and Children’s Library advertised online no longer existed
-	The fire alarm being set off twice in the early hours of the morning, meaning we had to deal with re-settling toddlers at 12:30am and 3:45am.
-	When I informed one of the reception staff that one of our toddlers had been sick in the room she never demonstrated any interest or compassion in the fact that he was unwell e.g. asking if we needed anything for him or even enquiring if he was now OK.
-	No prior communication that hot food would not be served after 5:30pm in the Bistro restaurant on New Year’s Eve meaning we had to feed our toddlers in our bedroom via room service. Informing us of this in advance would have allowed us to make alternative feeding arrangements.

We found the majority of the staff to be friendly and helpful but did not get the impression that families were ‘front of mind’ for any of them. We appreciate that it is an extremely busy time of year and that with a lot going on it can be difficult to please all of the people all of the time. However, in our experience, competing hotels such as Druids Glen and Inchydoney managed to ensure we felt valued and appreciated as clientele then I would hope it is also something that a hotel like Killashee, with four stars to its name, should be able to achieve.",2,2017,01,21
218,Back again ,"We have stayed here a number of times in the past and returned just over Christmas. 

The rooms were changed around since the last time and got a lovely facelift which was needed. 

Had a meal in the bar which was lovely. Although the bar area was busy the staff were doing there best to talk to all there guests and making  them feel at home. The meal was nice but the drink was expensive so only had one. 

We will be back again soon to see what else Killashee has to offer. ",5,2017,01,18
218,Not worth the money !,"I never write reviews here, but have to this time. Ok plus points first - Food in the bar was lovely and the waiter was nice.

I had a spa break here and an overnight stay - felt really rushed in the spa and herded around, the staff seem nice but too busy to actually give you a relaxing experience, its not a relaxaton break at all, you'd be better off to spend your pacage spa break somewhere else where you will be treated like someone who needs time out, not soemone to usher about as fast as possible.  
Had a 'foot ritual' that was a quick rub on each foot for about a minute ! Also as the previous poster said, the towels etc are not always changed and you cant rexal when you're wrapped up in qanpother persons towel or under a blanket that needs a good wash - hygiene is an issue.
Not a relaxing break.

The bedroom was shabby, dirty, dusty - definately not worth €170!! 
It was also incredibly hot so we couldnt sleep, even with windows open and radiators turned off, but the hotel heating was on apparently they said - also only two TV channels worked in the room and even then you couldnt see peoples heads, and no settings on remote to change it. No robes or slippers or luxury with this room and for that price, there should be! 

Also I have a disability and asked to be put in a room near a lift - and I wasnt ! 
Wont go back. Spa bad, hygiene bad, bedroom bad.",2,2017,01,17
218,Spa experience,"Although the staff in this hotel are very friendly and helpful, it is very sad to see how run down this hotel is. Shame on the management team.

I also had a bad experience in the spa. My massage was supposed to be 55 min but I only had 50 min and it also felt like a bit of a conveyor belt job. Within a minute of my massage being over I was rushed out of the room into another communal relax room which was full of people talking loud and to my horror I saw the cleaning staff reusing towels and blankets. That was enough for me to decide to leave straight away.

All in all the hotel itself and the staff are nice but badly managed. 
The spa should be seriously looked at as hygiene is an issue.",2,2017,01,16
218,Afternoon tea ,"Every couple of months myself and my boyfriend treat ourselves to afternoon tea in kilashee. 
Generally it's lovely but the last few times I feel it's gone down hill. Sandwiches are gorgeous and always are.. no complaints there. 
The service can be slow at times especially when looking for a top up of tea. It's like the staff stay one end of the restaurant away from everyone. When finally get the attention they are very friendly. 
The petite four and cakes change constantly. I didn't like the Christmas pudding that was served last week and felt Christmas was well and truly over and they were still serving it. There was a ginger maderia cake which wasn't the best either. No macaroons either... was disappointed 
",3,2017,01,14
218,Amazing family weekend away,We can't stay away from this place! Been going twice a year for several years now and this time we took the whole family. Loved it as always - my little girl loves the pool and we all had a fab meal in the bistro and a gorgeous breakfast the next morning. I can't recommend this place highly enough. We are already planning our next visit! ,5,2017,01,11
218,Fabulous Christmas Party,We had our company Christmas Party here in Dec 2016. I could not fault one bit of it.  Right from the booking and arranging the meal and overnight stay. ALL staff were wonderful.  The food was amazing and the attention we were given was second to none. The rooms are all lovely and have tea coffee/ Toiletries etc.  Irons also provided. The spa is very welcoming and they have a make up artist and Hairdressers too. ALL without leaving the premises. Its not the first time we have booked here for our Christmas party  or an overnight stay and it wont be the last. The same care and attention is given to corporate and individual guests. Fabulous,5,2017,01,10
218,Quiet and relaxing,"I love it . I have been for dinner , lunch and also stayed here on a different occassion. Wonderful spot for weddings with beautiful grounds , stunning. Once was a boys boarding school . Staff are polite and food is good , although the hotel in general is  a little over priced .",4,2017,01,09
218,Lovely spot ,"I stayed here for New Year's Eve 2016 with my three kids. Great spot, lovely food, fab cocktails and nice spa! Beds comfy and room was spacious. Breakfast was better than average with special order menu I had eggs Benedict and it was beautiful. Very good value for money ! We will return. 

Note The chicken wings are a must!",5,2017,01,08
218,Elegant hotel that impressed me,"Visited here in January having purchased a deal for my boyfriend and I. We also stayed in the hotel for a night. 
I love the decor of the place and even the room key cards have a lovely design on them, which really adds to the overall feel of the place. 
The spa itself was nice, however, the sauna wasn't working during our visit and the 'hydrotherapy suite' is pretty much a pool with jets and a little overhyped for what it is. The treatments were nice and every member of staff I encountered both in the hotel and the spa was really lovely and thoughtful, especially Virginia. 
Had dinner here that night and the food was lovely, but service was a little sporadic and we were left waiting a lot during courses and with empty plates in front of us. It was a busy evening so I know how difficult it can be. 
Breakfast was superb and they offer some options which are made to order such as: poached eggs and mackerel, scrambled eggs and smoked salmon etc which were an added treat. They also have a traditional breakfast buffet, arrive early! 
The rooms are lovely and warm. Lots of room and contain many antiques and nice little touches. 
Overall, a really nice experience that I would highly recommend. The quality of the staff here make Killashee what it is. Well done. ",4,2017,01,06
218,A superb wedding experience!,Went here just before Xmas for a friends wedding.  The whole experience was great but of note was the quality of food here.  Breakfast and the wedding food were truly superb.  Service was spot on too.  Room was comfortable but the shower water temperature simply wasn't hot enough!  Great venue for a big wedding such as the one we attended..,4,2017,01,05
218,Beautiful facility,"The Killashee Hotel and Leisure Spa was lovely. I found it through my CIE guide and it's about 2 km from Naas. It's far enough from Dublin to avoid a busy stay. Peaceful, a bit pricey but great service and spa. ",5,2017,01,04
218,Nice but expensive ,"We went here for a wedding recently. The rooms were nice and the facilities great.
There were more bars then i could count!  Its was all rather pricey, and there was a mix up of our bill which we believe saw us over charged (yet to be resolved)
Could possibly go back for a special occasion",4,2017,01,03
218,Anniversary ,"Was so excited to book kilashee house the web site painted a perfect image to help us celebrate our first wedding anniversary

We arrived to a beautiful view once inside that becomes very different.
It was so cold no heat in the lobby radiators off no fire lit yet its December...

The bed room was lovely only fault for us was the bath a shower we would prefer .

We went to dinner first night food great but restaurant was Like an night club so out of character to the hotel so much noise and echo was very in personal.

We asked where the bar with the cosy fire was that's advertised on the website and we were told oh closed we were so disappointed

So we sat out in the lobby for a drink we lasted 20min had to go to bed as the cikd was ridiculous

We asked about the restaurant could we book the fine dining for the Thursday but its only open Fri and sat ...even though it was Christmas
So our second dinner was in that horrible restaurant that was so hard to even talk in

The spa was so disappointing to walk out side through a car park from the hotel it definitely is not a world class spa 
As a guest you presume its attached to the hotel ...
So we go inquire are told book in and pay 10 euro each 
Ridiculous we stayed in many hotels with amazing spas never had to pay to use a steam room and hydrotherapy pool 
So dated so not worth the experience

In all great hotel for weddings as every day 2,to 3, were held there ....

Not great for couples who want cosy fires a nice comfy bar  to sit in a warm lobby a spa that's amazing.......

The lifts are crazy 
Good luck finding your room 

We won't defiantly be back .",2,2017,01,02
218,Very poor customer service,"Visited kilashee on the 27th December for one night stay
My sister booked 4 rooms 2 family 2 double weeks in advance and booked a dinner for 8 in the bistro. We arrived and checked in rooms were fine. Arrived down at 8pm to be told no reservation made (my sister specified the booking on the reservation by email and by phone on 2 occasions and was told yes we were booked in) after 15 minutes wait we were placed at a table by the bar where a door was consistently left open letting in a draft. The area was very dark and cold. We asked to be moved and told the table across from us was booked (we sat from 8 to 10pm and the table wasn't occupied at all) we had asked something to be done for our mum it was her 65th and promised they would do something special
....this didn't happen. We made what we could of the night and slept soundly. We went to check out and this was the rudest experience I have encountered. My sister booked the 4 rooms and left strict instructions that the rooms were to be charged to her card. We checked out and the lady at the counter simply printed off the bill and pushed it in front of us at the desk. I explained the rooms were covered and the response I received was yes the rooms were booked but nothing has been paid and she pushed the bill in front of us again.i had to pay out of embarrassment and due to this we were left out of pocket. Only for my sister paying the bill did someone else eventually cancel my bill (yet to be refunded) and help my sister. Staff were very rude and unhelpful. Received a generous booking and felt like we were just a number will not be staying again",2,2016,12,31
218,superb,a night to remember made even more special by an upgrade to a superior room. The rooms were lovely and we stayed on even later in the hotel lounge where our waiter was soo helpful. the grounds are very spacious,5,2016,12,31
218,High Tea at Killashee,"It was my first time experiencing afternoon tea, and it was a pleasant one.
The menu was a Christmas option, which was quite nice. 
I would normally be the type to only like my nana's Christmas pudding and I am the biggest critic of everyone else's - so I rate the Killashee Christmas pudding a good 8.5 out of 10; it was very close to perfect but just not my nana's (no other has ever come closer)! :)

The service team were very friendly and constantly were smiling (but not over bearing!). 

The dining room high tea is served is very quaint and for me was the perfect setting for this type of dining. 

Payment was confusing. We had asked for the bill and also asked if we had to pay at the till or at our table. The staff member explained that she could do either, and when initially told that we were paying by card, she explained that she would drop the bill down to us. 
When the bill was delivered, we waited quite a while before we asked if we could have the card machine to then be told that we had to pay at the till. 
Up until that point the service was perfect, however I can't say I didn't enjoy my experience based on that small bit of miscommunication. 

I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back.  ",4,2016,12,31
218,When you are good you are good,"This is the 3rd time we stayed in Killashee Hotel so we might have earned the right to comment. Once again our stay was faultless, reservations had kept us advised of any cancellations and when the opportunity came we grabbed it. This time we stayed in the Graydon Wing and I can recommend it as the room was impeccable. During our stay the hotel had upwards of 3 or 4 weddings not to mention some private parties in the bar area but the staff seemed to manage and maintain an air of calmness and serenity throughout. The dining room is closed during the week but the bar food is of an exceptional high standard and we ate 2  evening meals there. The breakfast in the morning is a total feast and is served up to 11.00am so you can enjoy this at your leisure. During our 3 visits we had numerous interactions with the staff. Some we managed to decipher their name tags others we did not but all staff seemed to be of the highest professional standard. Special mention here must go to Sorcha in the dining room , Niamh in reservations and Graham Murray at reception. The staff in the leisure centre are also due a mention for being so very helpful and patient with us .All in all a most enjoyable stay",5,2016,12,30
218,Well run,"Stayed here when attending a wedding. Well run establishment. Very young, friendly and numerous staff who were attentive. The food at the wedding was extremely good for the numbers attending and being fed at the same time. The breakfast was quite good too, but suffered a little from the cooked food having sat under burners for some time to keep it warm. The bedroom we had was spacious, clean and well equipped.

Overall, a good enough experience and I would stay again in similar circumstances.",4,2016,12,30
218,Wedding ,"We had our wedding in the Original House at Kilashee. Couldn't say enough good about it. All of our guests were commenting on how good the food was (which was important to us) also really great comments about the staff and the house itself. As for the planning and organising, Katie and Andrew were real pros. Katie was involved in the lead up to the wedding and Andrew was on duty on the day - always available and extremely accommodating. To sum it up, I couldn't recommend it as a wedding venue more highly. The house and grounds were the perfect backdrop for our pics, the staff were brilliant, really warm, welcoming and helpful and the food was incredible. ",5,2016,12,30
218,Always a great place to visit,"I love the Kilashee Hotel, great bar food in very comfy surroundings.  I Regularly eat here. It's in a stunning location just outside Naas. It's a very popular destination for weddings. The staff are friendly and helpful.",4,2016,12,28
218,Lovely relaxing break short distance from the city,"We had a fantastic stay here. Booked in for a night and came down early for the spa. Was so relaxing and the treatments were excellent. Staff were all very friendly and welcoming, including spa, restaurant and hotel staff. Our room was lovely, requested a twin and got two doubles in probably the most spacious hotel room I've stayed in. Great location, easy to slip away for a night from Dublin.",5,2016,12,19
218,Killashee,"A gem in lots of ways situated just out side Nass Co Kildare this place has it all.
Arriving at the check in desk  the staff were polite friendly and helpful.
The decor is luxurious and as you walk along the corridors  you are reminded of the history of the house and its different functions through out the years, 
The room was top class big enough to be a small apt , and you could not ask for more warm comfortable and all mod cons , 
The Spa was one of the best I have used . Treatments top Class from masseuse to the hydro baths, and again staff brilliant make you feel welcome and relaxed not just pushing you through the process.
The evening menu have lots of choices and four course meal at very reasonable price, We served by very efficient young ladies who were friendly and very up to date on the history behind the house, 
I had 8 oz. steak for my mains and I did not want it to come to an end .
Breakfast next morning same standard buffet breakfast but with a choice to order specials, 
It left me with one more piece to explore the gardens I took a stroll around all the gardens and it looks great in December I  must come back in the spring when all is in bloom, 
Killashee in my opinion best for my 2016 travels, Went home relaxed rested and well feed I intend to have a break here over the 2017 summer ,

218,Great wedding,"Good friends wedding was a ball. Lovely place and huge craic was had, although we did bring our own dwarf, dancing groomsmen and ring delivery hound. Staff were excellent . Nothing was too much trouble. 👍😄💃",5,2016,12,13
218,Smell of stable house and horses,"I was there on the business dinner and I couldnt believe - I feel the smell of horses and dirty stable. Never mind I thought, maybe food is better. Turned out, it depends. Stuff was confused, bringing 6 steaks for 6 people, coudnt remember the degree of frying and what kind of cut we ordered. I asked for medium rare and get from almost rare on one side to medium-well done on the other side. I also didnt get the jar of mayo that I order, but I get the jar od pepper sauce, that I didn't wanr and ask them not to bringing this thing. Meat was juicy but almost nor spiced at all.",3,2016,12,08
218,Stayed for a wedding & weekend,"I was here for my Sisters wedding October 21st. The hotel is beautiful. A fabulous setting. The food was amazing and the staff were excellent. There was a young guy in the residents bar on the night and also again the following night in the residents bar and he was amazing. I think his name was Jack. He was friendly and helpful, he joined in with the fun when appropriate and generally took good care of everyone.
The bedrooms were really lovely, really comfy beds, good stand room and very clean.
The function room was perfect for a wedding. The dance-floor is separated from the seating area by arches which means you can dance & have fun with the music but when sitting the music wasn't so loud you had to scream at each other to chat. Also it meant that you didn't have to move out of the room to clear the seats at the end of the meal which was nice,
We also had dinner in the bar the following night and again the food and service was brilliant.
One of the best venues I've ever been to for a wedding and also for a hotel break.",5,2016,12,07
218,A wonderful relaxing break with old school friends,"If you don't have time to read my review, here's some quick buzz words that sum up the weekend: Lush, cosy, fabulous, perfect, tranquil, friendly ...

This year, we (my 4 old school buddies and I) decided to meet up for a weekend of spa, pampering and catching up in the Killashee house hotel in County Kildare. 

We arrived late Friday to a warm welcome by staff to find the most perfectly decorated, clean and spacious bedrooms waiting for us. We ate dinner in Turners restaurant on both evenings. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was second-to-none. (Tomas, our waiter both nights and in the morning was exceptionally professional and courteous, making us feel like real VIPS.)  Breakfast was plentiful and top class, especially the Eggs Benedict !!

We sat in the bar by the open fire listening to music after dinner. Perfect setting for retelling the same ol stories from the 80s. The Guinness was good!

The spa was as equally amazing. We all had a massage, facial, and slept in dry floatation tank. Would highly recommend the dry floatation therapy treatment, for at least an hour!!

Think we'll definitely come here again next year!",5,2016,12,04
218,Very nice hotel,I did not expect much as this was a business trip but I was very positively surprised. I think this must be the hotel with strongest wifi ever and throughout the entire hotel. The rooms are very big and spacious. I had a very good time.,4,2016,12,03
218,Pampering the Unpampered ! ,"I went for an overnight Spa break with friends ...six of us women decided to spoil ourselves and chill out for a while. Picking Killashee house hotel was like pinning the tail on the donkey ..we had no preconceived notions as to what it would be like but the offer of Dinner / Breakfast & 2 spa treatments looked good .. 
We were not disappointed ..it was bliss ! 
Staff so pleasant and helpful - hotel itself had everything ..old world yet mordern in parts and very very cosy ! Loved the atmosphere .. Dinner that evening was the nicest meal I've had out in a long time ..beautiful food cooked to perfection , great choice and again nothing too much trouble for the helpful staff ... only little disappointment was there was no music in the bistro lounge as had there been we would have stayed on chatting over a few drinks OR better still a piano player tinkling away on the piano in the lovely lounge upstairs would have been the icing on the cake - breakfast was to perfection ..we loved it and the spa treatments later on were divine ..I'm not usually this gushing in my reviews but truthfully this was a lovely experience for myself and my friends and I have been telling everyone I know to check it out .. this hotel has ""personality"" hats off to the owners and all who work there .. we will be back ! ",5,2016,11,29
218,fab break away,"this hotel old world,  lovely atmosphere and  very friendly staff  . The food in the restaurant wAs beautiful ,top quality .The   room was very comfortable  .The whole experience was one to remember . Spa in hotel but didnt use.",5,2016,11,29
218,"Spa facility is disappointing, however afternoon tea was delicious","I attended Kilashee Hotel & Spa with a friend for afternoon tea and a spa treatment each. This is a review of two halves, a below par experience in the spa, with a nice experience at afternoon tea. 

Our spa treatments were first, so we located the spa at the back of the main hotel (separate building). We were brought to the changing area, which consists of 2 private changing rooms, 2 showers, and a general changing area with lockers. We then went up to the relaxation room which has 6 lounge beds, with some additional seating available in a reception area.

We both had booked in for back and shoulder massages which we both enjoyed, however at €55 for 25 minutes felt the treatments are on the expensive side for the duration. Therapist didnt not ask how firm I wanted the massage, which I found strange as it would be a usual question. 

Afterwards we returned to the relaxation room for a while, and then moved to the hydrotherapy suite.  This consists of a nice hydrotherapy pool area, with steam room and 4 lounge beds. 

We were both surprised at the limited nature of the spa, others we have visited have had a lot more areas to sit/lounge in, and were also surprised at the lack of jacuzzi and sauna room in the hydrotherapy area. There was a number of other visitors to the spa, which is advertised as having 18 treatment rooms, and we felt that the spa was very limited to accommodate the number of guests visiting it. When we returned to the relaxation room it was fully occupied so we no option but to sit in the reception area. 

We were both disappointed with the spa to be honest, it is nice and clean, but it is limited in seating space, lacks a sauna and jacuzzi, and we have visited several other spa facilities and unfortunately for us Killashee falls short. The photos of the spa online do not live up to the reality of the facility. We also felt that the treatments were expensive. When we booked we were advised that the use of the hydrotherapy area incurred an additional €10 each for 1.5 hours of use, which we felt was ridiculous, we were not charged this when we paid. My rating for the spa would be 3/5 at best. 

We then went up to the main hotel, and had afternoon tea, served in a beautiful room in the hotel. We were offered tea for a wide selection of varieties, which was topped up on a number of occasions. 

Our afternoon tea arrived within a few minutes, and it didn’t disappoint. The first layer consisted of 3 different savoury open sandwiches, beautifully presented and very tasty. We then had delicious warm scones, served with butter, jam and cream. The next layer consists of 4 cake varieties, with the top layer including 4 sweet treats. 

The presentation was impeccable, and everything was delicious. We both really enjoyed the afternoon tea, served in such a lovely setting. At €25 each (€30 for the processo version) it is on par with the cost in other hotels, and was one of the best we have had. 

The afternoon tea sitting has a 2 hour allowance, which we felt was adequate to enjoy it. Would certainly recommend this element of our trip to others, would return again, and would rate it 5 stars.",4,2016,11,27
218,wedding anniversary ,just home from an overnight stay in Naas where i celebrated my 2nd wedding anniversary. the hotel ticked all the boxes for my husband and I. junior suite was beautiful and spotless. Graham at reception went beyond his duties & I had to give him a mention. The girl working behind the bar had a wonderful personality  and was lovely to chat to. Breakfast was great with very attentive floor staff. thanks for a super stay.  ,5,2016,11,26
218,Fabulous,"Have stayed many times at this stage. Always a relaxed and enjoyable stay. Very friendly staff, great food, cocktails, luxury rooms and so clean. Gorgeous gardens to walk through or simply sit out with your drink and a good book. One of my favourite places to stay",5,2016,11,22
218," Christening dinner ",Excellent staff in the Bistro for Christening meal. Brilliant service from start to finish with delicious food. Thank you for the beautiful table setting. Our guests had a great time in the swimming pool and said the bedrooms were great. Lovely hotel for families. ,5,2016,11,21
218,Weekend ,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff all very helpful. Bedroom beautiful. We were a group of 7 couples and staff were very accommodating in ensuring we all got to sit together in the lounge.  Very  enjoyable experience ",5,2016,11,20
218,Lovely but cold,"Stayed recently with a friend on a shopping weekend away.
The location was great ,easy to reach and close to Kildare village and city shopping.
Grounds are gorgeous and decor in reception is very attractive.
The rooms were a long trek in many directions, corridors were very cold as you went between buildings but the bedrooms were roasting, too hot maybe at times.
We ate in the Bistro bar, staff were friendly and helpful but the layout lacked a cosy atmosphere. We were cold throughout the evening, there was one gas fire put this was hidden behind one table and certainly did not hear diners.
The brochure shows a beautiful open fire but on enquiry this is for private functions.
We took our drinks to the reception area where there are numerous couches and seating areas, we had to leave and go to our rooms.
Again there was only one fire for the very large seating area.
Seating could easily cater for 30 groups but there was only one group seated next to the fire but nobody else as it was so cold.
Music is advertised for Friday and Saturday nights, but on our Friday night stay there was no music although the hotel was extremely busy.
I would not stay again as the hotel lacked the comfort you expect at those prices",3,2016,11,20
218,"Great manor house, lovely garden, outstanding spa","This is a very pretty manor house with a lovely garden.  The spa is in a separate building but easily accessible from the hotel.  Breakfast is excellent and dining room is very pretty.
They also have a discount program with a mall that is about  20 min drive from the  hotel.
Very relaxing place, very comfortable.  A nice place to visit and stay.  Staff is welcoming and very pleasant.",5,2016,11,18
218,Excellent experience ,"We visited Killashee with a group of approx 70. The service was excellent with very good food in a really nice environment. Exceptional range of break out rooms. 
Would strongly recommend. The building is unusual with a mix of architecture from its historical past. ",5,2016,11,17
218,Beautiful Hotel - But hard to navigate,"Was here for a wedding recently and its a very nice hotel. The pictures were amazing because the grounds are so stunning.  However its an old convent building I think so its very very difficult to navigate.  The bedrooms are a trek to get too.  My parents got lost three times trying to find their rooms.  Some floors you have to go up to go down.  Its not suitable for older people.

The wedding itself the food was fab but the room was a bit odd.  The dance floor is very separate to the dining area for the wedding.  So people did not dance as much as they usually would at a wedding.  Normally the tables are pushed back but this didnt happen.

I don think this works.

The bar is really nice though",3,2016,11,16
218,fantastic break away,"Stayed here the October bank holiday weekend and enjoyed every second of it! The staff are very pleasant and helpful and the food is very good! The hotel itself is a beautiful hotel, with beautiful gardens to walk in and grounds to explore. The hotel has kept alot of the old features which add to its character. Our room had two queen size beds which were very comfortable and the en suite was a good size. There was a few weddings on over the weekend and the hotel was busy but we didn't hear any noise or sounds from the weddings. I think this is a good choice for families. We drove to blanchardstown from here and were there in under 40 minutes in heavy enough traffic. We also drove to powerscourt waterfall from here, which is alot further away but so, so worth seeing if you have the time. Definitely this hotel is one to stay in!",5,2016,11,15
218,for work,"I regularly stay at the Killashee hotel maybe 3 times a week when I'm away for work. I find the staff and service to be exceptional and the food is really some of the best i have had in a hotel some of the special dishes the chef comes up with are fantastic.
There is always a friendly welcome from all staff and nothing is too much trouble.",5,2016,11,15
218,Bank Holiday Weekend,"We stayed here for three nights over the October Bank Holiday weekend. Check in was swift and friendly and the facilities of the hotel were explained. It was a bit of a trip to our executive room but sometimes it's nice to have a relaxing walk. The room was large, well furnished and clean. It had all the usual facilities and most important a safe. Breakfast was served in the restaurant with a good choice of juices, cereals and hot or cold buffet. There was also a table service menu which you could order from if you liked. We dined in the bistro on two night's and the restaurant on one. Food is a little expensive but was of very good quality and most enjoyable. The hotel was very busy with guests and other functions that were taking place but saying that the service was excellent and there were ample staff to cater for all. The gardens around the hotel are well worth a visit and are beautifully maintained. The reception area was large and airy and nicely decorated for halloween.
Our overall experience of Killashee was very good with friendly staff, excellent food and good facilities. We would have no hesitation in returning and would recommend it if staying in the general area.",4,2016,11,13
218,Wedding,"What a place one of the. BEST venue to have your wedding in .the place the staff the food .service.detail to your wedding day .What a room to have the wedding in don't have to leave it every thing is there for you .well done Killashee any one looking for the perfict hotel go to Naas 

",4,2016,11,13
218,Perfect for families ,"We stayed here over the Halloween break. I loved it. The lady on reception was very friendly. Love the decor of the hotel especially in the reception and bar area. We were traveling with three children and our family room was lovely. Very clean and tidy. We had had our evening meal in the bar and the food was lovely. Our food may have been a little slow to arrive (but time perhaps travels slower when you're trying to entertain a very overtired 18month old) But it was delicious, and our waiter was very nice.
Take a walk around the hotel gardens if you have time, they were beautiful, even in late October. There's a little playground beyond the trees, with little fairy doors dotted around. A lovely touch. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it.",5,2016,11,13
218,Mixed,"We stayed on a very busy weekend, five sharing two rooms. The reception area and the bistro are lovely, modern, comfortable. Staff are generally very good, although waitress needed to keep more of an eye out for people trying to catch attention. We had a disappointing experience with our room. Window wide open and no radiator on when we arrived in at 8pm, an unflushed loo, a toilet door that wouldn't close and a blocked toilet subsequently. I raised on checkout and we got some money off but it was disappointing. Wish the pool was in the hotel rather than having to traipse across outside.",4,2016,11,12
218,Not impressed,"Went to the bar this evening with my wife and child (33mths). Restaurant/seating area wasn't overly busy, maybe half full. We sat for prob 15/20 min and had to find a staff member to get menus. Again, we had to seek out a staff member to order our food. The waiter that served us was pleasant and attentive. The food was a mixed bag. The fish and chips from children's menu was delicious. I got ribs and chips which was also nice. My wife got chicken wings which where stone cold. In fairness the waiter apologised and offered to replace them but with the waiting etc. we decided against it. I have been here on several occasions and the food has been very good but this was by far our most disappointing visit. ",2,2016,11,12
218,Beautiful Hotel With Friendly Staff,"Stayed for just one night on Tuesday 8th November 2016 as a couple and pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the outside of the hotel. The interior did not let us down either, it was a fantastic reception with a very friendly receptionist.Our room was very spacious, warm and comfortable. Restaurant food was excellent and prices were competitive. We will definitely return but this time we will stay a little longer.",5,2016,11,10
218,"nice hotel,great bar food but dont rush to the gym or spa.",Staff in the main hotel were very helpful and professional our room was clean and there was lots of hot water aval the next morning in the shower. The food and staff in the bar were really good. The only disappointment was when i went to book a treatment in the spa and use the gym. On approaching the spa reception i was told i couldnt have a look around as it was busy when i asked about treatments and times avail it seemed to cause the people behind the desk an inconvenience.,3,2016,11,09
218,Staff desperately in need of some training and proper supervision,"There is a lot that is good about this hotel set in an old convent building. It has character, is clean if not up to date, the wifi works well, the gym is worth the trek across the car park. But..........the staff desperately need some training and some supervision. The whole impression in of a bunch of well intentioned amateurs left to just get on with it. Where are the managers? Have the said managers ever stayed in a 4 or 5 star hotel?

Nowhere is this more apparent than the Bistro. The service was laughable. I ordered a bottle of red and a bottle of white for the table from the wine list. The waitress brought the wine, didn't even show us the bottles let alone ask anyone to taste and just proceeded to pour. We then noticed she had brought the wrong white....and the wrong red. The excuse for the white was that they were out of the one I ordered and the excuse for the red, there was no excuse. It was a mistake. It is never OK to just assume that if the wine ordered is unavailable the waitress can just pick another and proceed to serve it around the table. The waiter the previous evening needed training in how to extract a cork from a bottle.

The food we got was delicious but the kitchen is totally let down by the service. If the management of this place got their act together they could have an excellent hotel.",3,2016,11,07
218,Spa visit,"Would highly recommend this hotel... we enjoyed spa treatments, had a fabulous dinner with excellent choice... breakfast the next morning was super... hot and cold buffet and an a la Carte menu as well.. all fresh and hot... very friendly staff... great location not far from newbridge and Kildare village great for shopping....",5,2016,11,04
218,"""Quick"" Lunch ","My 3 star vote is a bit unfair with regards to the quality of the food, as it is actually really tasty. It's is also quite expensive which is fair enough when service is ""on point"". However I feel in this instance it wasn't quite up to scratch. 

The staff were friendly however service was incredibly slow. It took 40 mins for a club sandwich and burger to come out. Our sons food was delivered to our table after 20 mins and thus was gone by the time outs came. We pacified them with our phones (bad parents I know but when needs must) and inhaled our food so we could get out asap before they got rowdy. 

There was a duty manager stomping around the floor. However she seemed pretty unhappy in her job and at no point asked us were we being looked after (and our waitress never acknowledged any ""delay""). Maybe she wasn't taking note of customers but normally hotel duty managers are on the ball with this sort of thing. 

In short, foods great and staff are friendly enough - but when you pay €16.50 for a burger, €13.50 for a club sandwich and €7 for a child's sausage and mash you shouldn't have to wait 40 minutes. Worth a visit if you are in no real rush. ",3,2016,11,04
218,Luxurious Hotel,A beautiful setting for a magnificent hotel that oozes class. Staff are extremely professional and courteous. The room was Exceptional and the ensuite was class. The food was exquisite and served by very professional almost invisible staff (they  served us our every whim but were non intrusive). There was a huge Gym with all the latest technology/equipment. I will definitely return to this Gem of a Hotel,5,2016,11,04
218,Lovely hotel,"Fab bar area & food was delicious. Snug bar was quirky & full of candles with lighting fires, exceptional at Xmas time. Rooms a little dated but clean & fresh. Pool is across the car park, need to put a jacket on to walk across.... Pool nice, clean. ",5,2016,11,03
218,Wedding of My Son and my  New Daughter inlaw,"Hi all , Where do i start , One of the best Hotels We  have ever  stayed in , Staff where outstanding , Food was Excellent  , Drink price was reasonable for a Hotel and the Facilities where top class , We would like to Thank one of the bar men Sanjay who was top class , I would Highly recommend This Hotel for a Wedding or just even a long weekend , Maurice Hickey",5,2016,11,01
218,Nephew's wedding,"I booked in for 2 nights stay ended up staying in for 3 nights is was that fantastic, the staff are very helpful and friendly service was excellent, timmy the barman in the snug was a true gentleman, San jeep another gentleman with a beautiful welcoming smile and a wonderful character to have spoken to, and beautiful little Sophie that served our table at the wedding a little lady, the food I could not fault in any way proper hot food, my compliments to the chefs that were working on these 3 occasions food was fabulous, I would have no hesitations in recommending this fantastic hotel to anyone, ty to everyone on this special occasion that we were celebrating, we will definitely be in touch, 

Thank you so much xx David and ashling hickey",5,2016,11,01
218,Charming,"Recently attended a wedding, the staff were so attentive, food was amazing, the decor was so classy and our room was just right. We wish we'd booked in for a second night! Overall a charming hotel, suitable for a couple of friends.",4,2016,11,01
218,Very good Halloween break ,"We stayed for 2 nights here 2 adults and 2 kids in family room along with another couple who stayed in a double room. The family room was massive 2 large double beds and a single bed, beds very comfy, room also had settee and couple chairs so plenty of room for all the kids stuff!! 
Kids enjoyed the pool which was lovely and warm and plenty of room even when busy. The shower/changing area was slightly in need of attention but it would be hard to keep these wet areas clean when they are so busy. Good hair dryers and a play pen provided plus changing table for smaller kids. 

We ate in the bistro both nights, we wee recommended to book a table by reception so we did and the food was perfectly fine. Service was a bit slow and we had to ask a couple times for things so I think a few more staff on the bar even at weekends would be good - there were 2 weddings on when we stayed as well.

Breakfast was excellent plenty of choice and all very tasty. 

People complaining about the hotel being dated etc need to realise it's a old building and It's never going to be ultra modern so if that's what you are looking you will be disappointed. 

Rooms are very quiet and we never heard a noise all night (unusual for a hotel). If you have walking difficulties ask for a room near reception as some are quite a walk away and in and out of lifts etc.

All in all an excellent stay and we will definitely be back ",4,2016,10,31
218,Friends wedding ,"I'll start with the good points . Our room was huge 2 king-size beds for 1 couple . Bed the bed we used was great very comfortable.  I honestly had a great sleep which is rare in a hotel bed . The food was lovely 4 course meal and not a morsel left on any plate . Free guest WiFi.  The breakfast is an all you can eat style buffet . Over all quiet a nice stay . 

Now the bad . Some of the hotel is in need of a makeover and looks quite old and run down . The carpets on the way to where our friends wedding was looked filthy and lastly for a country hotel it was quite expensive . A pint and bottle of beer where €11.10 which is more than I'd pay in dublin .
Overall it was enjoyable . I would stay again . ",4,2016,10,31
218,Mixed bag ,"Came up on a family break for midterm. Impressive venue, clean rooms, great welcome, good breakfast. Rooms are a bit dated, to stand in cupboard being an an example. Toilet seat was not fitted properly. So us boys raising the seat needed to keep a hand on the seat to prevent a guillotine effect. 

Bistro service was poor. We were told when we checked in we did not have to book a table at the Bistro. But the next night when we went there we were asked if we'd booked a table. The maître d' was skeptics of our assertions that we were told there was no need. And was a little rude about it. It took a while to have our order taken. After our order arrived we were asked  if we'd changed our mind about drinks. My wife and I decided yes and gave our drink order to the waitress. She was never seen again. Well it was Halloween  at the time so perhaps the waitress was a ghost. No one came back  so I had to get up to find  wait staff and place the order again. The drinks finally came. But no one cane back to us. We were waiting to ask for the bill for so long that My wife and kids left to go back to the room. I could have walked out without paying, so little attention was given. The restaurant to be fair was busy. But a venue like this ought to better. I did finally flag someone and did pay. But I'd recommend heading into Naas to eat if you're at this hotel on a busy weekend.",3,2016,10,30
218,Elegant surroundings for a relaxing getaway,"We took my parents for an overnight stay here to celebrate their birthday's and also for myself and my husband to get a night away to relax. Having had previous bad experiences in other hotels in Ireland we had  been recommended this hotel so we thought we would try it out. 

On arrival the driveway and lead up to the hotel impresses. Ample parking within close walk to the hotel (or there is a drop off at front door). 

Check in was effortless and very quick. On getting to our rooms we were greeted with very spacious well presented rooms which overlooked part of the large garden area. It was warm as heating on and decorated in keeping with the theme of the hotel. 2 double beds in the room. TV, safe, hairdryer and tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We did not hear doors banging or people going and coming from their rooms which was a welcome surprise as this has been an irritation in the past in hotels we have stayed in. 

The main bar area was busy when we went for pre-dinner drinks but still got served with little effort and got seats straight away. After dinner we also sat in the bar and there was live music which was very good. 

We ate in Turner's as it was part of our rate (5 course meal) the decor and lighting created a pleasant environment for dining. Food was of a high standard and there was a good selection of choices. This is were the buffet breakfast is also served. Staff were very friendly and attentive especially Tomas he attended to us on our evening meal and the next morning at breakfast.
Negative points- I had booked ahead a few weeks in advance to reserve our table when we arrived it was clear to see they didn't have our booking but they quickly got us a table set up. 
Music choice could be thought about for the surroundings - eg. Robbie Williams and The Corrs playing more pop style music didn't fit.  

Swimming pool area is in a separate building from the hotel as stated by many but i is a short walk across a small car park. You can get out a back door from the bedrooms just follow the signs rather than take the longer walk advised by reception (going out of reception, around the front of the hotel and then back round to the complex) They provide you with locker keys and towels. 
Large pool and 2 steam rooms, 2 sauna's and 2 hot tubs make it ideal for it there is a large amount of people swimming. Also there is an extensive gym. 

We did not treat ourselves to any spa treatments so cannot comment on this area. 

Any staff we spoke or had dealings with were only too happy to help. 

The grounds itself are a lovely setting and we had a walk on the sunday morning before breakfast to go and see the area. Interesting history about the hotel also. 

Although there was a wedding on and a formal dinner the time we stayed the hotel was busy but it never felt overly busy or crowded. We will most def be back.",5,2016,10,30
218,Family wedding. ,The staff were very friendly & helpful. The hotel itself was very comfortable & the grounds were beautiful. The food was good & the wedding reception food was excellent & lots of it! I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,10,28
218,Flatters to decieve,"Was there for a wedding on 21/10/16. Generally friendly and attentive staff.  Felt compelled to review as very annoyed by the fact that there was a significant price difference between drinks purchased in main bar versus what I paid for same drinks in wedding.  Not a fussy guest but bed was like a plank of wood...basic hotels like premier Inn etc have far superior beds for a fraction of cost.  
Would be reluctant to  recommend this hotel to friends",3,2016,10,27
218,perfectly pleasant but boring food,"We had an evening meal here and I think it is probably a case of the meat eaters doing better then the vegetarian (not uncommon in this part of the world). Tomato and feta pasta. It was fine but how unimaginative can you get? The staff were very nice and accommodating, moving tables and generally getting us sorted as we were quite a large group with children and all arriving at different times. ",3,2016,10,24
218,Returning visit ,"We decided to return to the Killashee for a one night stay. I feel the place has gone down hill slightly. We were delighted to be upgraded to a suite but the room itself was a little dated and tired looking. Paint was falling off the walls and our window was broken so it wouldn't close. We ate in the bar, food was good but nothing special. Staff were pleasant but forgetting to reset cutlery and napkins after each course. The breakfast the next morning was delicious and we ordered from the menu which makes a nice change. Overall it was an enjoyable stay but the hotel definitely needs to up their standards. ",4,2016,10,23
218,Breathtaking!,"First time in Ireland and I wasn't excited about staying outside of Dublin. However, this hotel offers everything you will need. From food, room service, bars and access to the Irish country side a Dublin in less than an hour. The grounds are beautiful, hotel architecture and decor are very classic. Beautiful place for weddings. ",4,2016,10,22
218,Killashee wedding,Just at a wedding in Killashee. Was fantastic. Special mention to Colm who had the top table so happy and relaxed for the wedding breakfast. Plus Andrew and Jack who made the residents bar a night to remember for everyone and helped us keep the special day going. ,5,2016,10,22
218,Fantastic Hotel made even more special by the staff,"Attended a family wedding in this beautiful  hotel. Every aspect of our stay was brilliant, from the rooms to the food. I do want to make a special mention to the fantastic staff who really seemed to take pride in doing whatever they could you make their guests stay special. Special mention must go to Jack in the gorgeous residents bar and Colm who was one of the floor staff during our meal who both added hugely to our enjoyment of the day.",5,2016,10,22
218,Gorgeous Indulgence for last night in Ireland,"This place was so beautiful! We had a bit of a challenge finding it, but were we ever rewarded to drive up! So amazing, great staff, great gardens, wonderful food! 

We were 2 couples who stayed here 1 night to be closer to Dublin airport for the next day. Our room was so spacious, beautifully appointed, and perfectly clean. 
Amenities (soap,shampoo) were very luxe.
Prior to dinner while it was still light, we took a walk in the extensive gardens- butterfly garden, fairy woods, garden house, so peaceful and beautiful. 

Dinner we had in the Bar area as the main dining room wasn't open. 
It was delicious- I think we all had our eye on the Duck Breast, which was great. 
A really funny thing happened was that we asked our waitress for a glass of wine, then when she went by again we asked about it, and she said something like ""Oh you must have asked my sister- I'll check"" It turned out there were twin waitresses working there. So funny. 

We also had delicious desserts- This place was phenomenal.
It would be amazing to have a wedding or other event here.",5,2016,10,20
218,Killashee Hotel - gardens are breathtaking!,"Beautiful hotel surrounded by breathtaking gardens.  Staff is very courteous and helpful.  Room was quite large, nicely decorated, very clean and very quiet.  There are many large rooms in this hotel that would be great for weddings or parties or business events.  Dinner and breakfast were very good.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,10,20
218,bar staff,"Currently living in Manchester and am, myself involved in the hospitality business, and feel obliged to say that the staff working her, especially the bars are terrific. Specifically Jack who kept us well watered all evening and well in to the morning at the wedding afters. I cannot compliment the man enough, absolute gent and made an already good night in to a great night. BORINI.",5,2016,10,19
218,Daughters wedding,"Recently had a wedding in Killashee house hotel this venue is amazing it has beautiful setting it is clean and friendly.The place has a wonderful ambiance the rooms are specious and beautifully  decorated  the facilities are great with a great selection of bars and restaurants the food is fantastic brought to you by friendly staff who could not do enough to make your stay more pleasant.The bar staff in the different rooms we had were also very pleasant.Would like to say a special thanks to Katie Sloan wedding planner and Events manager Andrew also the following staff members Kayleigh,Timothy,Colm,Jack.Another great staff member was Louise at reception who was a diamond to deal with.Thank you to every member of staff at Killashee for a wonderful stay",5,2016,10,18
218,"Huge Room, Great Leisure Centre","Stayed here with my friend for a 2 night break. The location of the hotel is great Naas, Newbridge, Kildare & the Curragh all close by. We couldn't fault the hotel, our room was located at the end of the wing and was huge, containing 2 large double beds plus a single. It was also very quiet at night and in the morning, but then no-one was passing our door as we were at the end of the corridor. All the staff were friendly & pleasant particularly the staff in the Bistro. Again we couldn't fault the food it was excellent. In the mornings the breakfast was self service but as it was busy in the hotel the food wasn't sat under the cloches too long & was replenished often.
We enjoyed the facilities in the leisure centre and very well equiped gym. There was sauna, steam room and hot tub outside both the ladies & gents changing rooms, a great pool and we could have joined in the classes if we had wished. Only very small criticism was there was no water fountain on the pool deck or by the steam room etc, however when I asked the hygene assistant she took my water bottle & filled it for me.
 All in all a really pleasant stay and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",4,2016,10,18
218,Good location and all amenities - but huge,"From the images of the Killashee house hotel, I thought it would be an extended 'old worldly' type of hotel.  The main house and drive way up was promising and looked attractive, the main house and reception area was very comfortable.  However the hotel is huge! The corridors seemed to go on for ages and you had to go up and down stairs and lifts to get to your room, so you had totally lost your bearings when you got there. On the plus side as the hotel was big, although there was a wedding on it was totally separate.   The bedroom was large and comfortable,  a bit shabby but clean.  The leisure centre was in a separate building across the car park so there was no walking over in your bathrobe, but it had every type of equipment you could need in a gym.  The Pool was very large and it would  be great for families kids. 
The main restaurant was very old worldy and the service and food was good.   I just think some of the hotel is in need of refurbishment - the corridors and the bedrooms.",4,2016,10,18
218,Wonderful Experience,"We attended a conference at this hotel October 2-6, 2016.  We loved the hotel.  The lobby was nice and the light fixtures and chandeliers were gorgeous.  Our room was a little difficult to find.  It was on 2nd floor.  To get there, we took the lift to 2nd floor, walked the corridor and it somehow became 3rd floor.  We came to a lift and had to take the lift down to 2nd floor.  Once we figured it out, we did fine.  When we finally got to our room, the lights would not come on.  I called the desk and was told we needed to insert our key in a slot near the door.  I did and the lights came on.  That was different.  Our room was comfortable and the bathroom was modern.  The food served during the conference was delicious.  The grounds were nice.  One could spend hours walking and taking photographs.  The staff was helpful with what questions Ihad.",5,2016,10,17
218,Best spa day ever,"Spent a blissful day in spa 99 euro for 6 treatments ,staff so professional friendly beauticians where excellent massage was so good ,had dinner later food was superb ,we both had a great day and will defiantly be back,wish we had time off to have stayed overnight hopefully next time 
Thanks guys ",5,2016,10,17
218,Lovely relaxing break,My first to Killashee Hotel and it was a fabulous one.  We had some treatments in the afternoon after spending some time in the Hydrotherapy pool which was lovely and relaxing.  Dinner in the bistro that night was gorgeous and breakfast the next morning was equally as nice.  A very enjoyable break and one I look forward to again.,5,2016,10,17
218,Mould on the bread.,"The grounds are lovely. The dinner was nice. 
At breakfast, I picked up two slices of bread and only when I went to eat them I noticed there was mould on both slices, when I showed the server he just took it away and didn't issue any sort of apology. 
It's not hard to serve fresh bread. Apart from that, the rest of the food didn't have mould on it and was nice. ",3,2016,10,15
218,Over-rated,"The place looks nice, the grounds are nice, although we didn't get to see a lot because we were on a bus tour. The breakfast was good, buffet or menu, after that not so great, the dinner and service were underwhelming, the mattress was like sleeping on plywood, the room was so hot and no A/C. Not worth it in my opinion.",3,2016,10,13
218,"Lovely grounds,great service food delicious!","Stayed here for a wedding.The staff were efficient,courteous and very friendly.All the various meals for the wedding (tea/coffee scones on arrival,the wedding banquet,late evening buffet) and then breakfast were all delicious.The staff were so helpful all the time.We had a lovely walk in the gardens.I really enjoyed ""Emma's butterfly  garden"" which was created in association with Debra.It is a place to ""enjoy peace and tranquility"".I would definitely recommend this hotel.I think there could be weddings there all weekends as it is a fabulous venue for weddings.So I would suggest going there mid week to get the full benefit of the service and enjoyment of the facilities and walks.",5,2016,10,12
218,"the ""online dating"" version of hotel accommodations / an elegant dumpster","This hotel was a MAJOR disappointment for us.  Online it LOOKED so good and the reviews were GREAT, however in person it was incredibly underwhelming.  

The venue seems to cater to events (i.e. larger group parties and weddings), which only adds to its lack of charm and uncaring customer service.

Pros: 
Family friendly
Accommodates large groups
Good location
On-premises bar and dining (though the food wasn't good)
Easy to find
Easy parking 
Spacious room 
Free Wi-Fi

Cons: 
A large impersonal venue that poses to be something elegant and posh
Not clean - - filthy room and public spaces
Unhelpful staff
Mediocre dinner (at best) 
There was a bug in one of our drinks at dinner (we were not offered any kind of compensation when we pointed it out)
Over-priced for what you get
Noisy in the room and dining rooms (thin walls and bad acoustics)
Not restful
Our room's view was facing the dumpster
The hallway was freezing because the service door was kept open all the time
Awful breakfast (buffet and cook to order -- though no one ever asked for our order)
*I could go on, but these were the ""highlights""...*",2,2016,10,11
218,A Lovely Stay!,"I really enjoyed by stay here in Killashee.
I may have stayed for a night, but I did a lot (because there is a lot!)
The pool is big and spacious for you swimmers who do the laps!
The rooms are lovely and spacious with milk, sugar etc. for everyone's delicacy: Tea! 
The restaurant's food is beautiful! Don't go anywhere else to eat!",4,2016,10,09
218,Good getaway,"Convenient. 
Good food. 
Lovely rooms. 
Great hostory of an old convent.
Grounds worthy of a visit.
Good pool especially for kids.

It does what it says on tbe tin.

Nothing 5 star about it though. The sense that it could do better with a little investment. 

But if you get a good deal, you won't be disappointed. ",4,2016,10,07
218,Enjoy the warmth of Killashee,"Talk about a fantastic experience in Killashee, a few miles from Naas, Co Kildare. The grounds are beautiful and the smell of the air makes you feel relaxed and way from ten hustle and bustle of Dublin. We stayed in the Old House Bluebell Suite and it was stunning.",5,2016,10,05
218,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic staff, lovely food","Fantastic setting and grounds. The exterior grounds look lovely and interior décor is beautiful, very ornate. Very friendly and helpful staff, especially with food as I am a coeliac so had lots of questions at dinner. The food was really good, especially the desserts! 

The leisure centre/pool & spa is in separate building so you have to walk out to get to it and it is also a local gym / pool so was very busy when we were there. But it isn't too far of a walk and the spa was lovely.",5,2016,10,04
218,Wedding Party,"Excellent location for the family wedding we attended with an overnight stay, with space for all, and great service added to quality food, and big rooms. Plenty of spare party options for conferences, weddings etc",5,2016,10,04
218,Fantastic place with beautiful surroundings,"We have just returned from 3 nights here where we were bridesmaid and best man at a wedding. Cannot say enough good about this place, we were upgraded to a suite on night 2&3 and absolutely loved the whole experience. Food was fantastic, whether it was hot chicken wings in the pub (traditional Irish pub hidden at the back of the hotel) or the 4 course dinner at the wedding.... we had breakfast in the room on the morning of the wedding and it was all fantastic. Staff are super lovely with a special mention for the duty manager on the day of the wedding who really went over and above (between collecting handbags or making sure that guests were happy he was truly fantastic).
Yes there were one or two little parts that were less than perfect (some areas in the room weren't as clean as could be) but honestly it wouldn't put me off coming back here.
We walked into the beautiful town of Naas on Sunday and it was a really pretty place with lots of one of a kind shops.
Thank you for such a special weekend!
",5,2016,10,04
218,Bad food,"First impression from outside is nice
But after 3 times being there for food I've decided to leave place and don't come back
Last time we came in just after lunch time.
There was 5-6 tables all together.
Ordered 1starter to share 
1starter as a main and a sandwich.plus pineapple juice and coffee.
Got everything at once after 30 minutes (juice and coffee as well)
Haven't said anything.when I've ordered second coffee strait ahead  for take away because I couldn't wait for another half an hour. Got it after I've finished with starter and main.
No lid for cup,no sugar or even spoon .
Got charged for 2juices.
When I've said about mistake got bill where juice were more expensive for 1 bottle than in last bill.
Paid and left and never came back.",3,2016,10,03
218,Beautiful setting,"We stayed at Killashee House Oct 8&9th . We cannot praise the staff here high enough . Their attention to detail was excellent . We ate in Jacks and the food was lovely and good value . We had a lovely spacious room and housekeeping was very good . The gardens were a joy with all the wildlife . We loved watching the squirrels in particular . I had some treatments at the Spa and was really pleased with my therapist and left really relaxed and happy with my visit . We both used the leisure center and enjoyed it . We then traveled to Dublin and stayed at a hotel there . Here we felt we were ripped off after the service we got at Killashee . 
We look forward to returning to Killashee . Thank you .",5,2016,09,30
218,Superb place and fantastic staff,"Myself and my colleague brought nursing home residents to afternoon tea here after we'd been let down very last minute by another hotel. The staff were incredible from we first phoned until we left. They prepared some tables for us in no time at all. We had a resident who is a celiac with us but she had just as much choice as everyone else! Our server, Sorcha, was brilliant and literally could not do enough for us! This is sure to be a place we will be visiting again and again for our outings from our nursing home! Thank you for making our outing so relaxed and effortless!!!",5,2016,09,28
218,No attention to detail,"The Positives:
1. Beautiful setting, gardens and decor.
2. Family room was large, clean and very well serviced each day.
3. Breakfast very good and food generally very good in Bistro/Restuarant

The Negatives and there are many, unfortunately:
1. Offered no assistance with luggage at check-in despite having a toddler and baby with us.
2. Offered no advice that the distance from reception to room was up 1 lift, through a bar area, down another lift and down a long corridor.
3. Had asked for a Travel Cot when making the booking - it was not in the room on arrival.
4. Offered no advice about the location of the leisure centre which incidentally in across a busy car-park.
5. The Bistro and Bar was closed for renovation on the day of check-in and we were offered to advice about the alternative arrangements - i.e. Turners Restuarant/Gallery Bar.
6. The Bistro/Bar was open on the 2nd and 3rd day of our stay and my God the service was deplorable on both occasions - The 'Manager' could not find menus on the first evening; could not deliver a soft drink for our 3 year old (took 10 minutes to arrive and then came minus a straw); the young waiter did not write down our food order and subsequently got the toddlers order wrong, hence she waited 10 minutes for her food after ours arrived.
On the 3rd evening, we were left waiting to be seated for approx 7 minutes while the same 'Manager' sorted out arrangements in her head beside us, again the waiting staff were untrained and to take the biscuit our ice-cream dessert was accompanied by a soup spoon which unsurprisingly did not squeeze into the tall glass in which the ice-cream was served.

The Hotel Manager will now no doubt respond to my review but really its the owners that should respond because the fault of these failings lie with the Hotel Manager! There is obviously no leadership here and the attitude of the Bistro Manager and staff is 'take it or leave it' - certainly not 4 star service, not even 3.

While aspects of the stay worked for us, we could not possibly recommend the hotel to others as it does not nearly match its comparable 4 star hotels.",3,2016,09,26
218,"Beautiful setting, needs to work in service..","Gorgeous setting and impressive building. Rooms large and comfortable. Modern bar which was comfortable with friendly bar staff. However the staff did not seem to be well trained, little touches were missing (paper coasters for drinks), it's a very good 3 star in a 4 star setting. Long wait for service at dinner, staff again friendly but not on top of things. Wouldn't take much for management to raise the standard.",3,2016,09,25
218,Great hotel in lovely setting,Had two very pleasant nights here. The hotel is set in lovely surroundings and was a former school. Reception was full of Irish hospitality. My room was large and very clean. Hot drink facilities and bottled water were available. Wi-Fi was free and fast. Although I didn't have time for breakfast on either morning I found dinner in both the restaurant and the less formal dining area was very good. Service was again top notch. I checked out at silly o'clock in the morning and there was still a cheerful face on reception. I would happily come back here especially if I had more time.,5,2016,09,24
218,Lacklustre ,"I had really hoped to love this hotel. Staff good but rest very average. Family room booked but given a deluxe double with no apology as someone had given one of our rooms away. Pool says what it does on tin. Carpets in main stairs dirty, main toilets slightly smelly. A maze of a place with lots and lots of rooms. Walk through weddings to get to rooms. Wedding guests noisy down corridors in early hours waking up kids regularly.Greated in morning in main areas by very strong smell of cleaning products. Conservatory permenantly blocked off for wedding parties. Breakfast very average. Fruit salad way too hard to eat etc. A shame. ",2,2016,09,24
218,positive negative negative positive,well myself and my lady partner arriven and first impression where that hotel was first class..which it was..the hotel the room and the staff are are all very very good..especially the two twin sisters in resterant where very attentive...however the meals and food the fish on the menu and the burgers and chips on the menu proved to be very very bland in taste...buy t the time we where  approahed and order meals was bang out of place...the last night we where there from we sat down till we left was 2 hours and 10minutes...this is far to long to eat and complete a 3 course meal...we also observed other dinners leaving before they completed thier sweet course and thier drinks being brought after they finnished thier main course...one young man sent back his main course as it was cold when it arrived with him..a weak excuse was offered about having to change rooms regarding dineing in the hotel..they said the main bistro was being upgraded and things where upset and out of zink...this i do not accept as far to many people where affected..and changeing dineing rooms is a very lame excuse...so sadly when we left we where both on a downer..i have eaten in other hotels with numerous dineing rooms and service was very very quick...sadly killashea did not match or even attempt to conquer the slow service problem...so on points out of ten i give killashea only 6 six...and i doubt very much if we will be back..thank you.. mr frank magee,3,2016,09,24
218,Beautiful hotel with buckets of character,"Killashee is a former boarding school and the old buildings are just oozing with character.  Both outside and in the owners do a great job of maintaining the building and fixtures to a high standard.  Despite the age, the hotel public areas and rooms are all very clean and well fitted.

The hotel boasts three bars, a bistro and a nice restaurant.  The gardens are wonderfully kept and a joy to stroll through.  The staff were friendly and welcoming, check-in and out were fast and painless.

My room was huge, despite the old building it was modern in style but played well to the building's old character.  My room had a wonderfully comfortable bed, a beautiful old full bath and a nice shower.  The room lacked power sockets, but that was to be expected, and was a bit cold at the time I visited, but was very comfortable.

Wonderful hotel, will stay here again.",5,2016,09,23
218,Good first and last nights in Ireland,"Mother and I stayed here for 2 nights. Once after flying in to Dublin and again before flying out.

I chose the hotel from the photos so it was a bit disappointing that we never went into the part of the building with the tower.

The main entrance is to the right of the older building.

We arrived later than I expected due to a mix up with the hire car bookings. Luckily I had printed off directions to the hotel as it was not that easy to find being off the Naas ring road.

We asked about dinner which was in the Bistro as the main dining room was being used for a private function. The receptionist said she would book us a table but when we came back from our room 20 mins later no table was available.

so we ordered drinks at the bar and ended up eating our chowder there as well and very good it was.

The rooms are very large and along very wide corridors. It is quite easy to head off down the wrong corridor as they all look the same!

Breakfast the next morning was good. It was served in the most beautiful ballroom space. Has to be seen to be believed.

Only 2 niggles. One was that all the handles on the hot dishes were at an angle so difficult to lift when holding a plate. The other was the amount of butter on the tables. 2 very small portions! Ireland is famous for its butter so a little bit of generosity would not go amiss!

There is plenty of parking. It is much easier to head south from Killashee as it is to head north.

On our return trip we were heading back to the airport.

Very nice country hotel. Good food and good service.

Very highly recommended",5,2016,09,22
218,Spa day,"My friend and I went on a girly spa package. I've visited this spa regularly but it was my friends first visit. The spa is very luxurious and relaxing. The staff were friendly and helpful. However, there seemed to be a problem with the air conditioning as the place was quite warm and stuffy. It made the dry flotation treatment quite uncomfortable, which was a shame as the rest of the day was lovely.",4,2016,09,21
218,Very impressed,Stayed here while at a conference. Beautifully converted with a relaxed setting. Easy to access from Naas but feeling like you are away from it all. Good food. Found reception staff at times aloof but overall very good service.,4,2016,09,17
218,Beautiful!!!,"Very much enjoyed a one night stay in the hotel, breakfast lovely, Room most comfortable, linen crisp and clean and bed dreamy. There are loads of snugs and quiet areas to relax and chill in. Gardens and surrounds fabulous.",5,2016,09,16
218,Beautiful!! Great food and service and amazing rooms,"Went here for a break

Fantastic rooms with loads of character 

Food Was top notch. We had a delicious dinner in the bistro and breakfast too

Great location! Spa and pool are also top notch! 

I would definitely go back a few times again! ",5,2016,09,16
218,Lovely break,"My partner and two friends stayed at this hotel,our rooms were very good,the food was very good. Staff friendly and beautiful walks around the hotel grounds. Intend to return at a later date. Would definitely return.",4,2016,09,15
218,Excellant stay will return.,From the minute you arrive here you are treated  exceptionally well. Everybody is so customer focused. Very clean throughout. Great facilities. Food excellent. Nothing is any fuss. Spa / Leisure has great facilities & very friendly staff to boot.,5,2016,09,15
218,Old Charm,"Stayed here recently in this charming old style hotel which I felt had lost a little of its charm and luxurious feel. I had a very large room with a large shower room, it was a room suitable for wheelchair access.  Just a few things that would have made my stay better: the pillows need replacing, they were very flat and hard; there was no gluten free bread for breakfast, the gluten free choice was very limited throughout the day - even for tea breaks; the Wifi was very weak and kept cutting off, very frustrating.",3,2016,09,14
218,Gorgeous building with a real sense of history,"Had a spa break with a friend, lovely afternoon being completely pampered, then a fabulous meal and glass of wine. The reception staff told us the history of the building and invited us to wander around the old part to take it all in. A lovely stay, would go back again.",5,2016,09,14
218,Hidden Gem!,"Stayed at Killashee Hotel for a two night break with my young adult daughter recently. 
Beautiful old converted school with landscaped gardens edged by signposted woodland walks. Plentiful car parking in the hotel grounds. Extensive grounds definitely worth a ramble around. Quirky summer house with seating, fairy grotto and Butterfly garden were highlights for us. Old house mainly used for weddings but rooms are open for residents to admire so we wandered around and marvelled at the opulent decor and views from the windows. 
Hotel is divided into areas. There are lifts to each floor but some long corridors. Reception staff were competent, friendly and available 24/7. I needed a sewing kit which was available free of charge from reception and even came with pre threaded needles! Our room had all expected amenities; toiletries/tea and coffee making facilities/tv/wifi and iron/ironing board. Beds were firm but comfortable. Pillows were long but soft. Substantial breakfast included in room rate was served in Turners restaurant. Beautifully decorated room and great selection of hot and cold food available for self service breakfast. Other options available also from the menu. Staff were friendly but service was slow. 
We had dinner both nights in the Bistro, a beautifully decorated and well laid out room with garden access (for smokers!) Good variety on menu and food was tasty and hot but not cheap. We found the service was very slow both nights. I would definitely not recommend the Eton mess! It was rubbery and tasteless. 
The leisure centre and Spa are in a separate building accessed through the car park at the rear of the hotel. Well signposted from the hotel bedrooms. We used the leisure centre which had lockers in the changing rooms with separate shower/toilet areas. Key and padlock available from leisure centre reception. Staff there were busy and not the friendliest. There was a well stocked gym separate weights area and proper 25m training pool. Steam room/sauna and jacuzzi available poolside. 
Spa is another world!! We booked a great value 90 min pamper package which we thoroughly enjoyed. We returned the following day for two more treatments! Spa reception staff were friendly and accommodating but lacked conviction when we asked them about treatments and products. Reflexology therapists are only available at weekends which was not stated on the Spa brochure. Spa therapists were relaxed, friendly and competent. The hydrotherapy suite in the Spa is available to hotel residents and is much more relaxing than the leisure centre pool. The separate relaxation area in the Spa is only available to Spa clients. Would def recommend the Spa experience. 
Overall this hotel was a great find and I would definitely recommend it to fellow travellers.",4,2016,09,12
218,Beautiful building and grounds.,"Had a Sunday lunch here, lovely Hotel... but when we entered the restaurant /bar there was a strong smell of fish which was slightly off putting.
Chowder had too much dill. 
Tempura fish and home made fries were just OK
Not a great choice on menu. Have eaten here before but on this occasion was disappointing.",3,2016,09,10
218,Lovely treat,"I stayed at Killashee recently for a three night break with friends. 
From the moment one enters the reception hall each guest is made very welcome. After registration we had a lovely sandwich lunch and leisurely chat before we settled in our rooms.  
The rooms are very spacious, with lovely furniture and a very comfortable bed. Beautiful armchairs and tables add to the comfort of the room. We also had a delightful view over the pretty garden and summer house. The rooms were spotless. 

We dined in the Bistro each evening and the food was delicious.  Choosing starters mains and desserts was difficult as there were so many tempting dishes for dinner. 
We decided to have an afternoon tea on one of the days and it was a delight with so many lovely items, open sandwiches, scones with jam and cream and a large plate of different small cakes to suit all tastes. In the evening we had a starter meal only  but that was good too. 
Breakfast was amazing with so many hot and cold choices,cereals, fruit and many varied breads. Attention from the staff was excellent. 

We all agreed that the most outstanding part of this hotel concerns the staff. 
The senior staff and each member of junior staff  was polite, welcoming and always greeted each guest with a smile. This is so special and makes for a lovely atmosphere in every part of the hotel. 

I also visited the spa and enjoyed time there in their lovely pool and sauna before having a very relaxing massage. 

I loved my visit to Killashee Hotel and would like to say thank you to every member of staff who looked after us on our recent visit. It was a lovely treat which each of us enjoyed. 
Killashee is a very special and  lovely hotel to visit. Thank you very much to all the staff for their kindness. ",5,2016,09,10
218,Visited here at a wedding ,"I visited Killashee for a wedding a few weeks ago, fabulous grounds and very picturesque. 
The service was absolutely excellent and the lady that waited our table, her name was Carrie, was an absolute gem and looked after us brilliantly. Will definetly be returning soon.",5,2016,09,08
218,Kip,"My wife and I stayed there a year ago for my birthday and the place was amazing.
We returned a month ago to find to our horror that it had gone downhill. The smell of sewerage in the bar was overpowering. Every power socket in the lobby had an air freshener plugged in.",1,2016,09,08
218,"Aaron, star of the hotel ","Recently stayed here for business purposes and we as a group ate in the bar the two evenings, quite a few issues that could ruin anybodies occasion. And it quite obvious this operation was lacking any strong leadership or management. 
However there was one bright light and that being the waiter Aaron. A real shinning light. this young man was very attentive and professional and would  resolve other staffs mistakes without a bat of an eye lid. He also had a great personality and good sense of humour, something that can be lost with new inexperienced staff in our industry by trying to be too professional. Had it not been for Aaron our night would have been extremely depressing. He is what was the type of great character our fine hospitality industry was built on and is famous throughout the world for. 
Look after this young man as he is an asset to the hotel",5,2016,09,07
218,Good busy family hotel,"Great entrance close to Irish national stud and Japanese gardens. Nice foyer and rooms are comfortable. Bistro bar/restaurant is large and the weekend we were there, the service, while friendly was scant as there were not enough staff.  We were in no hurry, so all was good, but we did comment on it.
Overall though, we had a nice stay and the kids enjoyed the pool too. Would we go back? .... Yeah, I think we would.  We had a really enjoyable time :)",4,2016,09,07
218,Nice treat,"I recently stayed at Killashee with my daughter as we were attending an event in the hotel.At first sight it's an attractive old building with lovely gardens.We got a room in the old bell tower which was gorgeous .I would recommend asking for a room in the older part of the building.Our bathroom was new and had a free standing bath in the middle of the room with all mod cons. We found the staff from check in to check out great.We had room service our first night and it was delivered within 15 minutes and our meals were piping hot which was a first for me.We also had breakfast in our room which was also excellent .
The hotel was full while we were there but the staff did not appear to be under pressure and were very helpful.
It's a popular place for wedding and I can understand why as they are very professional .
We also had afternoon tea which was lovely with a very generous array of goodies.
I intend to return for a relaxing weekend and try out their spa.",4,2016,09,07
218,Foul play,"This is our 3rd time here , i booked it because it wasnt far away , it has gone down hill since last visit , it is stunning outside but inside is a let down , its been painted ect but has lost its charm , we ate in naas both nights because of a bad overpowering smell in the bistro, just as well we had a table in naas because the fine dining turners was closed sat eve , no info on that , lot of noise on landing at night . We wont be going back any time soon , a plus point is the lovely staff . .",3,2016,09,04
218,at a wedding,"Attended a wedding here didn`t stay the night, but it was lovely from the entrance and the drive up to a beautiful garden. lots of parking spaces and well lit at night. food was excellent the room was marvellous with a separate dance floor, so no need to move seats.",4,2016,09,04
218,Outdated with a foul odour ,"Stayed here on a girly night away! We went and attended a show here! We were so excited to stay here as we had seen the pictures on the kilashee website of this picturesque manor hotel! Having worked in a 4 star manor hotel for years I was expecting great things! Driving into the hotel is beautiful especially as the sun was shining it's magnificent from the outside. But... once you get inside it is not so magnificent! Our room smelled like must, it was not 4star quality, the bathroom was not beautiful old style but old fashioned and smelled like there was a water leak! The sheets had all makeup marks, we actually couldn't wait to get home and shower! We went to the bar for food, but the smell in the bar was absolutely revolting, It was like a food gone off or a dead animal (this was not just on the night, but the next morning we had gone through the bar to go to the smoking area and the smell was worse, we were gagging and I would have a strong stomach). Having sat for food in the bar we quickly decided against same and got some chips, as we felt this was probably the safest option, warning the service is very slow, we asked for the bill and eventually had to get up ourselves eventually to get it.  Breakfast was OK, (the croissant was nice) but when we left our room to attend breakfast there was a strong+++ smell of raw onions the whole corridor and lift. I can't even describe it properly, we were so gutted with our whole experience! The decor of the hotel, which we saw, was very much in need of a lift, the corridors reminded me of an old fashioned out dated hostel, it does not match the decor of the outside of the building and the beautiful surroundings. We didn't complain as we were afraid we would be moved to a worse room than we had received! I would not stay here again, my friends and I ain't hard to please and wouldn't be fussy at all but this hotel takes the biscuit! It's overpriced(€215 for 1 night) in my opinion I would not recommend.",1,2016,09,03
218,Meetings ,"Lovely location outside Naas. The wifi here is good through out the hotel. Very elegant and clean hotel. Bar staff very attentive and pleasant. 
Main Restraunt in lovely setting with elegant views. Unfortunately the food was cold and soup disappointing not what you would expect here. 
Would recommend a visit but dine in bar or the town. ",3,2016,09,03
218,Lovely stay in gorgeous surroundings!,"Myself & my Fiancé stayed here on a Sunday night recently and we were blown away with the sheer size of the hotel, there are so many areas to sit and relax. To get to our bedroom was a bit of trek, we had to take two different lifts but it didn't take away from our stay. The rooms were lovely and clean. We had dinner in the main bar area, and after briefly chatting to our waitress about why we were here (it was my birthday) during dessert the staff came out with a second dessert & sang happy birthday to me, which was a lovely touch. Also the surrounding gardens are beautiful and the fairy doors on the trees outside are very cute. We also availed of the spa the next day and my therapist was very friendly. Would definitely be recommending this hotel to our friends.",5,2016,09,02
218,Wonderful wedding venue with great hospitality. ,"Attended the killashee for a wedding over 3 days.
Booking was easy. The reception staff were friendly and accommodating.  
On arrival,  check in was busy but fast and efficient.  With sweeping drive and impressive entrance hall, killashee is a beautiful venue. The room we had was lovely.  Clean and spacious.  
The staff were all very accommodating. Service was great. 
We used the swimming pool and sauna, which were busy, but clean. 
Breakfast choices were good and although the eggs benidict were a bit salty they were still great. 
Thank you so much to the staff of the killashee for making this week so wonderful.  Will definitely be back.",5,2016,09,02
218,This is not a Four Start hotel!,"We stayed here for one night on the 28th of August.  To say I was disappointed was an understatement.  First off, we booked one of their 'special offers' - a shop and stay weekend.  The price for this was €10 more expensive than if we had booked just an ordinary overnight but we were supposed to receive a 10% discount card for Kildare Village Shopping outlet.  When we arrived, there was no mention of the discount card and I didn't ask - to see would we be offered it on departure - we weren't.   The hotel and grounds are very impressive, but as has been commented in previous reviews, the sense of grandeur stops once you enter the hotel.  To be fair, the receptionist told us they are in the middle of a refurbishment programme.  Bedrooms had been done, the restaurant area was on the cards for the next few months.  We were given our room and made our way to it, full of excitement.  The photographs of the rooms on their website look both glamourous and sumptuous.  Unfortunately, it was not what we got.  The overall feeling from the room was one of 'tiredness'.  The furniture was old and in need of repair; the doors of the wardrobe were warped and didn't close properly unless you pushed against the hinges.  The beautiful bedspreads on the website were missing,  the tea and coffee making facilities were hidden in the bottom of the tv cabinet and I didn't see them until we were leaving.  The television channels didn't come through clearly.  All of these things in and of themselves are not major, I do understand this.  So, lets move on.
The package we had booked was one evening dinner and a bed and breakfast.  We'd received this voucher because it was our anniversary, so I wanted to upgrade from the 'bistro' to the A La Carte Restaurant 'Turners', which is a bit more salubrious.  But on enquiring about it I was told Turners is closed on a Sunday.  So much for those who want to have a nice meal then!  We ate instead in the Bistro.  We were put beside a window overlooking part of the garden and set about choosing our food.  Anything that was half decent had a supplement added to the price, over and above the meal package.  When the waitress came down, we were told the fillet steak was gone, as was one of the fish choices.  It was very early in the evening - 7pm, so it wasn't due to the restaurant running out of those choices.  I ordered my meal as did my husband and ten minutes later the waitress returns and as true as I'm typing this she told me.  ""Yis are going to kill me.  There is no crab starter left.""   Now, for staff at any restaurant to use those words is bad enough.  But this was the was all the staff spoke.  
""Are yis okay there"".  
""How's it goin' folks"".   I know I'm being picky.  But I just couldn't get over the level of unprofessionalism we came across for the whole weekend.  For staff at a 4 star hotel/restaurant to speak like that is bad form.  I changed my starter and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Eventually the food arrived.  My goatscheese mousse was presented as two dollops on the plate with some lettuce leaves scattered around it and two pieces of what appeared to be inedible hard pastry sticking out the top.  I know because I tried to eat it.  Not good at all.  Mains for me was the special of the day - roast beef with chive mash, and my husband had the Thai red curry.  My beef was nice, the chive mash was missing the chives,  and the vegetables served alongside it were barely warm and too crunchy.  I know al-dente is a thing these days, but these veggies were simply shown the hot water and removed before they could soften at all.  My husbands curry was delightful and he would have given his mains the thumbs up if the nan bread served alongside his curry hadn't been like cardboard.  He was convinced it was yesterdays bread simply reheated.  The desserts however were lovely.  But I left the table hungry.   
We went into the bar and asked for two ports.  The girl serving behind the bar didn't know what port was, and couldn't find a bottle of it anywhere.  She tried to serve us whiskey instead and laughed off her ignorance.  Two more ports later, our culinary experience was being put behind us.  We decided to get one more port for the road and head off to bed.  The man who served my husband on this occasion put one serving of port into the two glasses.  When my husband queried what he was doing, the young chap said he'd just run out of port so there wasn't enough for two full servings but it was okay he'd divided up what was left between the two glasses.   And then tried to charge him for two drinks.  We didn't pay it obviously but that should have been a 'no-brainer'.  Apologise and charge for one!  Again, so unprofessional.
Breakfast the next morning was fine.  It was a buffet, so you simply helped yourself.  There was a section on their menu where if you wanted something different than what was presented at the buffet, you could order it, however a dearth of staff in the restaurant meant we were never asked if we'd like to order anything.  We barely got a pot of coffee, so we counted ourselves lucky.  We had been in the breakfast room by 9am.  But those who arrived closer to 9.30 or 10.00 had to stand in a long queue and wait to be seated.  Tables around the breakfast room remained uncleaned and unset as people stood at the door.  Had I been one of those, I would not have been impressed at all.  

I have been to Kilashee Hotel before a few years ago.  I don't remember this level of dysfunction or unprofessionalism from the staff.   When we were checking out, I was asked to pay the bill.  I informed the receptionist I had already paid because I'd used a voucher and it took her a full 5 minutes to check and then tell me yes, everything was good.  I was never offered the 10% off discount card that was part of the weekend package.

I am not impressed at all.   And I won't be back to Kilashee.",3,2016,09,01
218,This is a stunning hotel,"This is a massive hotel from the golden age and well restored like some of the great hotels in London 
The gardens  are Superb and it is a must for anyone going to the Curragh 
Our mistake was going on a bank holiday weekend so it was very busy but they felt with it
Brilliant breakfast and even better spa : pool facilities",5,2016,08,30
218,disappointing not 4 star go elsewhere!,"We fancied a trip to Kildare just before the schools go back .We were enticed by the marvellous picture of the old house section at Killashee and on arrival it is really impressive driving up to the front .this wow factor disappears when you try to get to your room , but more of that later .
On arrival staff didn't mention the location of the spa , breakfast times .They also didn't mention the available discount at Kildare shopping village and other attractions as a hotel guest .
The location of the rooms would not suit elderly or people with disabilities as getting to our room involved  ,going up in the lift crossing another reception area ,going along a raised corridor then taking another lift down again to another corridor .Going to the spa was another hike outside .
On the Sunday afternoon when we arrived the corridor was blocked with laundry trolleys abandoned everywhere , I had to move these to get passed, surely this poses a risk if premises needed to be evacuated  quickly .
Some of the reviews mention  the 141 rooms have been  redecorated .The quality of the fittings in our room were such that the electrical sockets were installed crocked, and in the bathroom the towel rail was hanging off. 
We had a comfortable night's sleep but breakfast was not good .
Hot food like eggs and bacon were cold , there was a shortage of serving tongs on the breakfast table. The toaster area was completely  covered in crumbs ,marmalade and jam was held in large pots with sticky rims .Individual pots would be much better .Same for brown and red sauce. Food area in general could easily have been kept cleaner with little effort .
Dirty dishes were accumulated in the centre of the dining room ,rather than taken directly away to kitchen .Crumbs on floor and window sills ,with dead wasps indicated a lack of cleaning or staff awareness. 
We did submit a comment card on the first day but this wasn't acted on or acknowledged.
The paintwork and décor at the lift areas at the end of the corridors is really badly marked and battered .surely this is an easy fix , the place just looks shabby ,and could be so much better with some attention to detail .
This cant be graded as 4 star or priced as such in this state .We have stayed in better premier inns. In summary both staff and hotel need to do better . I simply cant understand the very positive comments on tripadvisor  go elsewhere.",2,2016,08,30
218,1st class,"arrived to a complementary upgrade,  fantastic touch which set up the weekend perfectly. Room was superb,  and every staff member was friendly,  helpful and nothing was a problem despite being very busy. Cannot wait to return to this wonderful hotel in the future. The only negative, and it's very minor,  was the €9 cheeseboard, we'll give it a miss next time,  but that certainly didn't dampen the experience. excellence from start to  finish
",5,2016,08,29
218,Amazing Place,"Attended a wedding here on Saturday last.  What a fantastic Hotel !  Staff were warm and welcoming, the space is enormous and the food was fantastic.  Our Room was large and airy with a good sized bathroom. Breakfast is super with choice of hot or cold food and a la carte Menu.  The Eggs Benedict are worth a try.  They have the most beautiful Gardens which are well worth a visit, particularly the Butterfly Gardens.  First Class Hotel - cant wait to return.",5,2016,08,29
218,"First class facilities in a beautiful location, unfortunately noisy at night.","The hotel and its gardens are beautiful. The rooms are comfortable, clean, spacious and well presented. The food in the bistro was first class, the food was lovely and they catered well for families and children. The pool/leisure area is also brilliant, clean and well laid out for families. They also have a gym, spa, hair salon, fairy trail and outdoor play area for children (the indoor 'children's library and duplo room' is a room with two boxes of children's books which you can borrow - I didn't see any duplo). Breakfast was lovely, excellent selection of quality food (continental and cooked as well as pastries, salamis and cheeses, although there were no beans, and I do love beans with a fryup).

My only complaint would be the noise level at night, I suppose it is to be expected in an older property but you can hear other guests returning to their rooms at all hours, and we could hear the occupants of the room upstairs when they were walking around/had their tv on (which we wouldn't have minded if it hadn't been at 1am :( ). I did mention this to a young lady at reception but her response was ""Oh I'm sorry about that"" and that was that. If she had addressed my complaint better maybe I wouldn't have come away so annoyed.",4,2016,08,28
218,Holiday,"This was a beautiful place. The grounds are magnificent, beautiful Butterfly garden, Fairy garden and play area for children. The staff in the Hotel were lovely especially in  the Bar and Resturant.  The only draw back was the Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre were a distance from Hotel. Its a pity there's not a covered  walk way from the Hotel.",4,2016,08,26
218,"nice hotel, outside of nass, handy for outlet",I stayed here for 1 night with a group of friends. The bedroom was nice & big I shared a twin room & was delighted when I saw that we both had our own double bed. which over looked the garden. The bathroom I though were a little dated.,4,2016,08,26
218,A Classy Period Hotel with beautiful gardens,"We travelled in a large group, we were looked after superbly, the food was excellent, staff were extremely helpful and charming. The rooms were very spacious, the decoration of the hotel has a old worldly charm, beautiful chandeliers, lovely twin sweeping staircase. A massive gym, pool and a beautiful Spa. Set a little way out from the charming Irish town of Naas, Thoroughly recommendable.",5,2016,08,25
218,Great people,"Ok. So the place may look a little dated, but the way we were looked after, from start to finish, by the staff here was exceptional. 
We had an issue with our TV, they fixed it within minutes. Our kids loved the evening time club, which allowed us a very welcome break.  
The only negative, was the outdoor courtyard. We had a few drinks out there, but it could have done with a clean up. 
We also used the pool, which was very clean, and is attached to a large gym. The dinner menu was comprehensive, and the food was great. The breakfast was as good.
Looking forward to returning here.",5,2016,08,24
218,Such a disappointment ,"We are actually at this hotel at the moment are cutting our stay short... 
The hotel is anything but clean, the place is covered in dust and cobwebs, but we thought so what this is the kids last break of the holidays! 
We went to the spa which is located outside across the car park from the back door from the main building, the place was littered with cigarette butts, once entering into the spa we had to walk right through a busy gym with 3 little kids! The swimming pool was great for the kids though! 
We went to the bistro for dinner whilst entering we were told there was no tables, I explained we were hotel guests and how long would it be, we were seated immediately.  We ordered our food and drinks, the kids orange did not come! All our food came out together even though we some of us had ordered starters, the kids portions were awful and not only that they ordered chicken, my son said mum this tastes funny... It was cold inside and slimy, my other son had already eaten half of his before we realised! 
My husband didn't even receive his dinner! Absolutely horrifying experience and all we got was a sorry don't worry bout the bill!! Are you actually serious! 
The manager then came to see us and asked us what we wanted in return, I didn't complain to expect something for nothing and told him so!! I have stayed in many hotels and never have I ever been treated with such disrespect!!!
NEVER EVER AGAIN",1,2016,08,23
218,Fab Stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Very impressive outside and inside. It's a very large hotel, we were 2 lifts and a walk from our rooms. Rooms were lovely, very luxurious. Breakfast was fab, staff were attentive and there was a great selection. We had an issue with heating in our room and we were moved to a different room for our second night and the staff were very helpful about it. Very convenient for Kildare Village, Newbridge and Dublin. Will definitely be back.",5,2016,08,23
218,Great breakfast!,Lovely stay in the Killashee for 1 night on a Sunday. Dinner was good but breakfast was great!  Grounds lovely to walk around. Staff very friendly & helpful - especially at the front desk! Would definitely return!,4,2016,08,23
218,Beautiful Country Hotel only a stones throw from Dublin City,"We stayed here for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed it.  On arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to be told by the lovely receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite in the old part of the hotel.  Thankfully, we both have working knee joints as there is no lift in this part of the building, so anyone who has difficulty with stairs, ask about lift access when booking. 
The suite was very spacious but unfortunately for me, other than the lovely bathroom with the roll top bath, the decor was extremely lack lustre.  For such an historic building I was surprised with the bland colour schemes and for a suite that could have been very impressive, it was boring.  A few nice reds and golds on a comforter or changing the curtains and cushions to add a bit of brightness would have elevated the rooms dramatically. Beige is simply not suited to a building as old as this where sumptious warm coloured satins, silks and damask would be more appropriate !
On a much more positive note, the staff were all very professional, friendly and helpful, starting with the receptionist to the lovely helpful barman and all the waiting staff.  This is what brought the hotel into a higher realm, the people.  
Unfortunately, due to the lovely Irish weather, we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful looking gardens but from the bedroom window, they looked exquisite.
The breakfast was simply divine, best sausages ever and my waistline is still recovering from all the lovely pastries, crossants are not exactly on my diet plan!
All told, a nice hotel, great staff, good food but a re-think on the bedroom decor would bring the hotel into a much more luxurious category.",4,2016,08,23
218,relaxing spa two nites,I really enjoyed my time in the hotel.  The staff were so nice.  Could not have asked for nicer people.  Friendly and curteous.  Food was excellent.  The spa was wonderful.  Was on my own for a destress couple of days.  Did not feel awkward dining on my own or sitting having drink the staff were so nice and chatted with me.,5,2016,08,23
218,Fabulous hotel! ,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, it's a stunning building set in the most beautiful grounds, there's a lovely drive up and plenty of parking, the reception is lovely, fabulous chandeliers everywhere, the staff are very friendly, we stayed in a junior suite and it was huge! Four poster bed, jacuzzi bath, separate shower, couch and a table and chairs, lovely antique furniture in the room too. We had cocktails in the bar and they were very tasty, the prices are reasonable too. There was live music as it was a Saturday night we were staying, the band was very good, we sat in the lobby on the very luxurious velvet couches. It was very busy next morning for breakfast but we were seated quickly, it was a buffet style breakfast and everything was very tasty.  This is more like a 5 star hotel, I will definitely be back, didn't get to try the leisure centre as we didn't have time but it looks lovely. Highly recommend this place. ",5,2016,08,23
218,Greay family break,"Loved staying at this hotel, we stayed here a few years ago and this time we stayed with our 3 children (6, 4 and 1). It is a beautiful hotel and the rooms were a great size for the 5 of us. The kids club in the evening worked out great for the 2 older kids. Leisure centre was impressive but was a bit if a maze to find it! The food was top notch, really excellent.",5,2016,08,23
218,Beautiful Hotel,"The drive up was beautiful. The grounds were impeccably kept. The hotel lobby was very nice. The hotel bar restaurant was a bit boring. The food was ok. The room was overall pretty nice. There was a couple things off about the room though. The wall paper in one space was coming off the wall. One of the frames was broken and poorly repaired. The shower was a bit odd, it was fully equipped for wheelchair access, but we did not request a wheelchair accessible room. The beds were wonderful! I was woken up early in the morning by a man drilling and banging on a door a little bit up the hall (I guess it needed repairing) We could also hear everything that was going on in the hall. I really wish that maintenance man hadn't have woken me up and the door was not paper thin because aside from that, I was impressed with this hotel. It has a great history and it's beautiful to look at! ",5,2016,08,22
218,Pamper Spa Day,"On arrival we had a swim in the main pool, jacuzzi and steam before we headed for the Hydrotherapy pool. This was very good with jets for specific areas of the body and very relaxing. The back massage was excellent and the facial was really good. The staff were all very friendly and professional. Perfect location and beautiful surroundings made for a great day. I would highly recommend this Spa.",4,2016,08,22
218,Wedding Accommodation Disappointment,We were attending a wedding in this hotel so we booked in for the night. We decided to book a Superior Double Room. We were very disappointed with the so called 'Superior' room. The room had nothing in it to even suggest it was superior. The tiles in the shower were dirty and the room was a basic as it gets. For us this was overpriced and not value for money.,3,2016,08,22
218,old fashioned but elegant,"Spent two nights here and were upgraded to room in old house.  Bed was a small double so we asked to see a regular room.  Much better, two large double beds and very roomy. Bring a ball of string to find your way back to your room.  Swimming pool was in need of an upgrade, and was very busy with an aerobics class.  The pool is not exclusive to the hotel and is a short walk away.  Hydropool is an extra ten euro. Staff were very nice.  Did not eat hereas only the bistro was open, but breakfast was very good.",4,2016,08,21
218,Hen Party - Excellent,"Just home from my sisters Hen Party in Killashee. Being in a group that wouldn't be into night clubs or drinking too much this was the perfect location! 

Run up to the hen: 
Had lots of phone calls with the hotel organising the party, confirming numbers, finding out if things were possible - they made life so easy for me, it was fantastic! We had gifts for each room which they put in for us no bother, organised a space for our activity and suggested and helped with dinner time etc

Check in:
Perfect, informative and quick.  

Afternoon Tea:
We had 18 people for Tea, they sat us all at the one table, the food was delicious, more than enough for everyone. The setting was fabulous, the staff were brilliant, all ran seamlessly. We had personalised candles etc for the table, they put these out & organised the table beautifully. One coeliac who was given her own tiered stand, she said it was lovely.  Could not fault it. 

Dinner in Turners:
Again organised for a group of 19 to sit together. The food was fabulous, well timed with taking of orders etc, service was exceptional when handing out the food, everyone was served at once, which makes a big difference when you have 19 people waiting on everyone to have their food to start. Nice menu, very varied choice, enjoyed every course. 

Bistro Bar:
A lovely member of staff organised and reserved a table for us in the bar, again sitting 19 people together, they had to move furniture etc to accommodate us, but it felt like nothing was a bother to them, it was great. Moved furniture around the reception area to accommodate us before dinner so we could all sit together & play a game or two, and offered before I even had to ask, it was lovely. Cocktails were lovely, band were good, went out of their way to find out the Bride to Be name & played a song for her. 

Breakfast: 
Delicious, plentiful and not too busy considering how many people were staying in the hotel, very relaxed. Coeliac breakfast was well catered for, separate area with freshly baked goods. 

Rooms: 
Spacious, beds comfy, big tv, nice slippers. Our room was a tiny bit tired looking but it was clean and certainly on the nicer end of hen party accommodation!!

All in all I could not fault this hotel, their helpfulness was over and above anything I could have expected, with a wedding  on the day of the hen I couldn't believe how well minded we were. Will 100% be returning, a sentiment shared by most the guests. Thanks to all at the Killashee for making it such a lovely weekend. 

",5,2016,08,21
218,Brilliant service,"This hotel has excellent customer service. They are very helpful, and can't do enough for you. The grounds were immaculate. Breakfast is quite varied but beware it is not always out. You have to ask for most things. The hotel itself is not as clean as it should be hence why I gave it a score of 3. ",3,2016,08,21
218,Disappointed 😞 ,Treated my friend to a birthday afternoon tea here at killashee. I've had afternoon tea in a number of hotels and I'm afraid this was definitely one of the most disappointing. As in some of the other reviews the ham was slimy processed stuff and lacked any sort of flavour. I agree with the other comments on the lack of flavours and also the sweet to savoury ratio. There was also a strawberry milkshake in a shot glass that was just horrendous. We had a number of unsuccessful attempts at getting servers attention and my second pot of tea was just hot water poured onto the previous tea leaves. The location and surroundings are lovely and picturesque but the quality of food and service is most definitely not worth €25 per person.  ,2,2016,08,20
218,Beautiful hotel ,"Had 2 nights stay here for a wedding,it was just beautiful,all the staff in the hotel were extremely polite and pleasant,the room was also lovely,I would like to thank Jack Delahunty (barman)and Aaron Winders (waiter),absolute gentlemen,would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area",5,2016,08,20
218,Lovely Hotel with Stunning Grounds,"Had a one night stay and from my first contact with reception, was very impressed.   Got a great rate for me and two teenagers.  Lovely clean rooms, big comfy beds, great wifi connection.   Had eaten out earlier so only wanted starter with chips for dinner which was not a problem.   Very friendly staff.   What is really beautiful about this hotel are the grounds.   Lovely butterfly garden, fairy trail, walkways....  Great place for kids to run around or for adults to hide with a good book.  Again its a family hotel, so if going as a couple ask for a room in a quiet part of the hotel!!!   Well worth booking Spa in advance as very busy.  Really enjoyed my stay... will go back.",5,2016,08,18
218,fantastic,"Hotel was beautiful and restaurant was nice.  A bit out of the way, but very nice.  Takes a good while to get there. Restaurant required reservations but bar did not.  Bar was just as nice.  Golf course surrounds hotel.",5,2016,08,18
218,"Great spacious room, food not up to standard expected. ","Excellent location with fantastic rooms and a great gym. Service in the bistro restaurant was not up to 4 star standard and the food was very bland throughout. We stayed here in 2007 and every bit of our stay back then was much more of a memorable experience. Seems like the standard has dropped over the past 9 years. 
The gardens were very picturesque and well maintained. Service was good at the main reception. ",3,2016,08,18
218,Downton Abbey number two.😁😁,"My husband and I attended our friends daughters wedding reception in Kilashee two weeks today. We were there for two nights and we had a really fabulous stay. Wedding reception, food, service,staff,hotel grounds all fabulous. The staff were so helpful. But  what really made it for us was the fact we were upgraded to a suite in the original part of the hotel. The suite was amazing. Massive separate sitting room with lovely furniture, Windows and TV. Huge bedroom with two massive Windows, massive bed, chandelier, two more massive Windows through which we had really beautiful views on the amazing gardens and butterfly garden .The bathrooms also huge with a lovely free standing bath and walk in shower. The chocolates on the pillow at night were also a lovely touch. I did not really want my stay to come to an end. All in all we had a really great stay. Fully recommended.",5,2016,08,18
218,Killashee,"This was a lovely hotel with beautiful grounds.very convenient  to National Stud and gardens
Our twin bedded room had two double beds and was very roomy .
We enjoyed our stay.
We would have preferred the option of the dining room as the Bistro was very busy and noisy.",4,2016,08,17
218,Weekend break,"Recently stayed in this hotel had a fantastic weekend break away, grounds are beautiful, food excellent staff very friendly and accommodating grand entrance sweeping staircase beautiful chandeliers everywhere, getting to your rooms took some navigating ...you had to go up to go down ..hilarious when had a few ...swimming pool very basic but had jacuzzi either end with steam room and sauna ..didn't get to take full advantage of the spa and hydro pool but informed it was an amazing experience lol not too far to local village of Naas or hour or so into Dublin itself this hotel has something for everyone from fairy forests, wedding venue to just a good Ol Irish dancing knees up will certainly visit again was a great craic 😂",4,2016,08,15
218,Fantastic hotel with plenty of charm!,"You will not be disappointed here!  The staff are fantastic, the food incredible and facilities/ grounds excellent.

I would definitely stay here again.

The rooms are being decorated as we speak and some could do with modernising, however in many ways this adds to the charm.

My only negative is the swimming pool doesn't look like the spa photo's I saw.  Maybe there is another pool somewhere.",5,2016,08,14
218,Overnight stay ,"Lovely hotel. My wife is pregnant and all of staff there were brilliant ! Very friendly and helpful.
Beautiful surroundings and very spacious rooms and large beds. Would happily go again. Only slight downs are, no air con in our room,and bistro lunch and dinner menu are the same although they have ""lunch"" & ""Dinner"" written on them.
But Alls good, and a jacuzzi bath in the room!.and breakfast was brill
The spa looked great but did not get a chance to use it:)",4,2016,08,14
218,Family get together,"High points :Fabulous entrance and swift check in.
Low points: Room navigation was surreal, should have been equipped with a sat nav, up lift, down corridor, down lift. Room clean but in need of revamp.. Stains on table, carpets. Same for bathroom. Dined in bistro bar in evening, very slow service but food ok. Only one bar tender on duty and unaccepatable for such a busy hotel..waited 20 mins plus to order.. One family member ordered hot whiskey and waited 30 mins as NO Kettle in bar and had to be ordered from kitchen!! Breakfast staff need serious training (not there fault), we had to ask for tea and coffee 3 times... Also noticed other diners having same issue. For money paid was quite disappointed overall.",3,2016,08,12
218,Girly spa day/night ,"Visited mid week on a girly spa day with friends! Booked the spa indulgence package. Suppose I can't deny that you pay for what you get as this package was a lot cheaper than similar packages in other spa hotels. While the treatments were nice I felt like they were very rushed and felt like
Just mini tasters of each type of treatment! The hotel in general is beautiful and the only fault I could find is the confusing lifts from floor to floor to get to the bedrooms! Breakfast very impressive with a great selection of fresh fruits, pastries, full Irish and cereals also impressed by the menu order service from the kitchen! One downfall is the lack of snacks available as when we returned from a few drinks in naas there was no nibbles such as crisps or chocolate available to buy at the bar! Overall a nice stay but the spa package is one to watch if your looking for total relaxation I would go for a more expensive option ",4,2016,08,12
218,Girlie Spa Day and Afternoon Tea,"Just back from a spa day at Killashee House Hotel. My mother and I both had the Spa Indulgence package. Overall, it was a lovely day with invaluable mother-daughter time spent together. However, there are areas for improvement which should be addressed by the hotel to improve their standards.

The hydrotherapy pool is lovely, with lots of different options for massages, swim jets, jacuzzi area within the pool etc. It's heated to a lovely temperature also. The steam room was lovely, and got very steamy once you were in it, as I have been in some which don't. The hot/cold showers in the hydrotherapy areas were fine, but the tiles around this area did get very slippy. Changing facilities were clean, and perfectly functional. One small point would be in the shower areas to put hooks on the wall so that you can hang up your robe/tower instead of having to leave them on the floor. Showers should be checked regularly to make sure that shampoo/body washes are there as 2 of the three holders in the shower I used were empty. 

The treatments themselves were good. I definitely felt like the customer who had bought the cheap deal online in that they were a bit rushed to allow for the next person. Therapists were very chatty and friendly, and this may sound bizzare, but during a massage I prefer to relax and not chat, so this for me took away from the relaxation element of the treatments. I had never done dry floatation before, and although it was a little warm as a previous reviewer had said, it was very relaxing and the room was darkened and quiet, perfect for a little snooze! Relaxation room afterwards was very quiet and peaceful.

After our treatments we walked over to the main building for afternoon tea. It was a little pricey at E50 for 2 people, but to be fair you did get a wide range of baked goods and pastries, more than I have had at other afternoon teas. Slight confusion over the sandwiches, at other afternoon teas I have had, the selection of sandwiches was pre-determined, so I assumed this would be the same and had asked to change the smoked salmon for chicken, however a miscommunication meant all the sandwiches were chicken as you can actually order the selection of sandwiches you would like here. I would suggest maybe more sandwiches and less sweets, but that is just a personal preference.

The grounds and gardens are lovely and well maintained, very nice to have a walk around. The reception area is impressive also, as another reviewer mentioned, the staircase is amazing, perfect for wedding photos, as are the gardens. Lovely drive up to the hotel also. The hotel could do with a little work, in keeping with the time of the original building, just fresh and clean. Its a pity extensions over the years have detracted from the original character of the property, with one section looking more like a factory entrance than a hotel. 

All staff were very friendly and helpful, they are a huge asset to the hotel. Overall, I have far more positive things to say about the hotel than negative. I would return to the spa again.",4,2016,08,11
218,COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER,"Few of us visited for a weekend stay. 

Upsides. On the whole the staff were brilliant, very attentive, friendly and probably the highlight of our trip. Location and setting nice.

Our room was located in one of the ""wings"" and to get to our room required us to take one lift up, then a fairly long walk to take another lift down and another long walk. If you've mobility problems, be aware. Took 10 minutes to get from reception to room. Room itself was a good size but beginning to look dated. Bathroom ditto, albeit both were spotless to be fair.

Food was very changeable. Dinner in bistro was fine, if a little impersonal. Thai curry was perfectly acceptable. Breakfast was just okay. The eggs are pre cooked. Scrambled were akin to rubber. Fried eggs had turned to rubber.

Gym could have been cleaner, lacking attention to detail.

The hotel is beginning to look tired. Yes the staff are a credit to the hotel. But, it's just all very average. Nothing really makes it a standout. Just average.

",3,2016,08,10
218,Simply Stunning,This hotel is just out of this world. Its beautiful designed. The staircase is just stunning. Would be perfect for wedding photographs! The staff are so professional and well trained. I didn't get a chance to check out the spa but if the hotel standard is anything to go by I am sure it is out of this world.,5,2016,08,10
218,mini moon away,I organised a little get away for my new wife and I before going back to work at this hotel. Emailed in advance so they could we could get something to remember but we will remember it for a different reason. We arrived thought there might be something to congratulate us but nothing room was big but old and dirty looking. Went for a really good massage then we where going to pop back get room service and relax but no there was loud music coming from the gym waited for a hour for it to stop but didn't rang reception too complain went for another 45 minutes. Should of left then but I thought it would get better but no. Went out and bought a nice bottle of champagne took a hour for a ice bucket to be bought to the room. Our  so called dinner was in the bar with 10 families around us. Only good thing was one staff member picked up that we where going to leave and up graded us to a  nice room and went out of her way to make us happy. We won't be back,2,2016,08,09
218,family break,beautiful hotel def need a car very isollated hotel staff very helpfull and kind. stayed the hottest day of the year and the room was so warm no air con and window ony opened so far for safety reason went to reception on the 1st night to open window but the staff had gone home with the key and no spare (no happy) thy did open it the next day when cleaning staff turned up but stil need air con. hotel food sooo over priced 2 adults 2 kids over 80 euro for a meal crazy and very plain. went to eddie rockets the 2nd night half the price and nicer. pool is fab and gym is great but a walk from the holel note extra charge for the gym if staying in the hotel but pool is free,4,2016,08,09
218,Top waiter and bar man ! ,"Attended a wedding here on Saturday! Aaron wonders was serving our table (Meath table!) he was top waiter and bar man, absolute gent and mighty craic, give this guy a raise! The girls behind the bar Kayleigh and Tina were lovely, staff were a real asset to the night :) ",4,2016,08,08
218,Spa Treatment Special very deceiving,"Booked a spa special costing 100 Euro with 2 family members as it was to include 3 hours of treatments according to a lady I spoke to in the spa. It turned out the treatments were one and a half hours the other one and a half included the hydro pool. Now I personally would not spend an hour and a half in any pool, but as it turned out we could not use it. The pool is quite deep for people who do not swim, there was no one attending and when we went to the section that is like a Jacuzzi the steps were too high for us to get in and out of. As I said there was no one in attendance so we could not ask anyone about it. The back massage and the facially were good, the head hand and arm were none existent so to call it 5 treatments is not exactly true. The floating bed was ok but far too hot and this combined with the fact that they had no air conditioning made it uncomfortable. I came away exhausted from the heat rather than revitalised. They had a pack with some creams they were selling for (as I was told) 60euro half of which goes to breast cancer but when I went to buy it they said it was 70Euro. I did complain to the staff about the increased cost and the Air Con but they didn't seem to care. Also 10euro for a sandwich and 5 euro for a bowl of soup is quiet over the top. We will not be returning",3,2016,08,08
218,Disappointing ,"Check in was straightforward & efficient.
Attended wedding & stayed in room 232.
Room was very disappointing on this occasion (have stayed many times). 
Green furnishings which were not in line with other rooms I've stayed in.
7am & the bloody NOISE outside of trucks. I could have cried as could not go back to sleep so this ruined it for us.
Had ordered breakfast to the room, filled out the card and placed outside door.
We got one cooked breakfast, rice crispies & fruit & charged €10 extra on checkout for that! 
Very disappointing on this occasion.

218,"Bar staff not to be seen , stood at the bar for 15-20 minutes with nobody ",For the price paid I expected some sort of 5 star service but was met with lazy ignorant staff 20 minutes standing at a bar. And I was the only person at the bar . The next day I had the same issue with a food order I wanted to order food and was told that I had to wait for the waiting staff as she was bar staff and didn't serve food ,1,2016,08,07
218,wonderful wedding venue,"wonderful wedding venue. had an amazing time here recently for my friend's wedding. The room or should I say suite was immaculate and the bathroom was really modern and had a brilliant shower. 
The grounds of the hotel are definitely worth checking out and exploring out the back. 
As a wedding venue, it was just perfect. Fantastic meal and service. Really big dance floor.",4,2016,08,06
218,Great staff,"The staff here are brilliant. The place is not without fault, investment in refreshing the general decor and some changes to the food philosophy of the place will make it a real 4-5 star experience.

That aside, it has true spirit, great architecture, an historical ambience, (did I mention 'great staff'?), wifi everywhere and great staff.

One piece of advice I would give is that if the beer is warm, don't sell it.
Another is that five fantastic chicken wings are worth more than twenty mediocre wings.

Looking forward to my next stay!",4,2016,08,05
218,Family wedding,"We recently had a family wedding in the Killashee. As it was a family wedding we had out 4 boys with us. We rang weeks in advance to check if the TV in the childrens TV room was suitable for their games console. They said it was.
On the night of the wedding we found it was not compatible. I went to reception and asked if it was possible to have another TV brought in, they assured me it would be done and was no trouble.
After 1 hour I asked again and was again told that it would be there in a few minutes.
The TV never arrived.

So basically its a very good venue for a wedding, just don't bring your children as the staff will tell lies about what is available for children.",4,2016,08,05
218,Grounds and food very nice,Outside is lovely with nice gardens and the food is very good however the distance between bedrooms and conference centre is a good 10 minute walk as all on different levels and corridors in between. This is a real pain and very confusing for anyone to navigate. Rooms I feel are dated and the decor apart from the bar are in need of a makeover. Staff are very pleasant and the location is good. ,3,2016,08,04
218,The Best Hotel Stay ,"We stayed on a mid week break with our kids in a very spacious family room. Everything about the hotel is fabulous.  The drive up to the hotel is so picturesque and breath taking. The reception area is  impressive. Our room has two queen beds and it is really comfortable.  The bathroom is well stocked with toiletries.  
We had dinner in the Bistro last night and everything was really perfect. The waiters were extremely helpful with the children.  The food was totally amazing. Their chocolate and hazelnut tartlet is officially my favourite dessert ever. 
The breakfast was excellent. The choices available caters for everyone.  Then there is a selection of omelette, eggs benidict, poached eggs which is very good. 
The grounds surrounding the hotel are well worth exploring.  There is a lot to see from the Butterfly garden to the woodland walk 
The leisure centre again caters well fir everyone.  There's a well equipped gym and a swimming pool with a kids pool.  The only thing I will say is that the tiles at the bottom of the pools are slippy. These are not very safe especially when you are carrying a baby around in kids pool.
Overall I am very impressed with the hotel. It is quite and caters perfectly for all our needs. I can't wait to stay here again but without the children so that we can relax more. ",5,2016,08,04
218,Wedding 31 July 2016,"On behalf of my husband and I we would like to thank killashee for making our wedding an amazing day.  From the time we booked our wedding to the actual day itself, it was such an easy and enjoyable experience working with Katie, Lisa Marie, Andrew, Brian , Marcus the head chef and all at Killashee. 
Our guests loved the hotel, the gardens and the food.  It was a truly special day and the staff are just amazing.  We would highly recommend killashee not just because it is a beautiful setting but because in this hotel, you are dealing with people who do their job so well, they make it look easy. They are all so professional, well mannered, enthusiastic but make you truly feel like you are the most important people there. 
Without hesitation, if you are looking to get married, please visit killashee, you'll book it there and then, just like we did and it was the best decision we ever made.
Thank you killashee.
Best regards
Eoin and Sabrina",5,2016,08,02
218,Won't be back,"Stayed for one night. The hotel is in need of some serious updating, decor and furnishings are worn out, dated and poorly maintained. Staff attitude was awful, wait staff had clearly had no training whatsoever, the menu was unimaginative, food was bland and portions were very poor. When we complained the manageress clearly didn't care. It was an awful stay and I would advise anyone to spend their money elsewhere.",1,2016,08,02
218,One night stay,"Hotel and grounds are worthy of the 4 stars. Apart from that, not much else is. Staff on reception are friendly. Bedroom was ok, nice and clean, heating not working. Had food in bistro bar in the evening, food was burnt and bland. Was overstaffed but staff seemed to be wandering around like headless chickens, only time they came to the table was to take our order and bring us our meal. Had to ask for water which was met the waitress' eyes rolling to the sky. Ordered a glass of red wine, which i could see was watered down, even tasted watered down. The evening was not much enjoyed by any of us.",3,2016,08,02
218,Absolutely Superb,"This hotel is excellent. The staff are fantastic and work very hard and everyone was so helpful, kind and welcoming. The receptionists was very helpful and made us feel very special and welcome. Our room was superb with a massive bathroom and 4 poster bed which made it all the more special as we were celebrating an anniversary. The food is lovely both in the bar and for breakfast. The pastries at breakfast were extremely tasty. There are lovely walks around the hotel and the gardens are really nice and relaxing to walk around. It was a well needed break and it lived up to our expectations and was very relaxing. We will definitely be returning. It is also close to many tourist activities such as Newbridge Silverware, Kildare Village Outlet Shopping Centre and The National Stud and Japanese Gardens. We didn't use the leisure centre or spa but they looked lovely, but they are located in a separate building to the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,02
218,Attending a conference in Naas,"Killashee Hotel is in a beautiful setting  to hold a conference in. I did not stay overnight but attended this two day conference. I had lunch on both days and was a little disappointed on both days with the lunch provided. I felt that there was little option to avail of healthy food options, instead on offer there  was on offer deep fried calamari, sausages, burgers. There was some salads but limited.",3,2016,08,01
218,Home from Home,"The Killashee has become the hotel of choice for weekly trips when seeing clients in Naas. Staff are great, surroundings are fabulous. The pool and gym is a great bonus and every meal has been wonderful. Make sure you sample the breakfast with a huge range of delights to set you up for the day. ",5,2016,07,31
218,One night spa break,"Stayed one night on dinner B and B package , very nice hotel but maybe not as modern as expected .Rooms where spacious and spotless .The spa is located separate to the hotel across a car park but worth the walk .Had dinner in the bar/bistro ,food was good while service was attentive and friendly ,breakfast was a hot and cold buffet with a good selection on both.Lovely gardens to stroll around .Would return again ",4,2016,07,31
218,lunch not great,We just visited to have a nice lunch and we ordered few foods and... everything was a bit of let down. was expecting more from a hotel.. the quality of food is just not great and its all blend and .. was not a great experience.,2,2016,07,30
218,Dinner and chilling,"Really love coming here the food is delicious and it's always got a great vibe, love to see the young staff they are all so polite and refined, notable Cormac at the bar and Kevin serving our meal, but in fairness they are all lovely. I travel a bit and stay in good hotels and tend to be picky, what's missing ? Finer details, the female waiting staff are very well turned out some of the lads are in skinny jeans and I don't really get why there is such a variation on ties, and aprons, there should always always be a fire lit if there's a fire place, especially if there's a fire place in reception, no matter how sunny it is, and stunning floral display, reception is screaming out for a soft touch. This hotel has an amazing gallery, mostly used for weddings, a shame really high tea would be super cool up there, or just for tea or coffee. Nothing negative only pointers, because I spend so many days away in hotels. Would definitely say come and enjoy, looking forward to the day I get to sleep here.",4,2016,07,29
218,Very Pleasant Surprise!!,"Found this by accident as my usual hotel was fully booked. Big, rambling old house adapted as a hotel and its huge. Room was big and traditionally well appointed but so quiet. High standard of food and service in the bar, in fact the staff were exemplary across the board. Sadly only a one night stay but as a lone female traveller I felt safe and well looked after. I will return, thank you. Caroline.",5,2016,07,29
218,Thanks,"Stayed at Killashee and had a lovely time. I left an item of clothing in the room on checkout. I contacted Carine the household manager who took such care in packaging and returning my property within a few days. Thanks to the household staff for providing such a great service to me.
Anita. ",5,2016,07,29
218,Conference stay,"I stayed in the Killashee recently as I was attending a conference and it was a very enjoyable stay. The best aspect for me was the breakfast. Everything was freshly cooked and there was a good choice. The staff are lovely. We ate in the restaurant that evening and it was really nice also (I would recommend the prawn starter and the salmon main course). My room was very clean, spacious and had all he amenities you would expect of a ""high end"" 4-star. I will return again when I am in Naas in the future. ",4,2016,07,28
218,Excellent & expensive ,"I'll be back because it's a fantastic, spacious hotel, good quality breakfast, great views, very clean hotel, overall great experience, however very expensive... 25 euro for 2 tiny sandwiches after 9pm...I'll skip that next time I'm there.  Some bartenders not very approachable, slow service behind the bar.",5,2016,07,24
218,Chance encounter.,Very pleasant stay at an iconic venue. Spacious rooms and extensive grounds if you fancy a stroll. Breakfast is included in the room rate and dinner can be included for a fixed rate which is a good deal. Be aware that some of the more expensive dishes will require an extra payment if you choose them. It is marked on the menu under the relevant meal. Check out is 12:00 giving you a very casual start to the day if you so desire.,4,2016,07,22
218,wonderful break in killashee house,"Just back from a wonderful break in killashee house , the house , the restaurant, the staff , the gardens and the spa are just amazing . We had a lovely time and would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxing break in a beautiful hotel and gardens",5,2016,07,21
218,Beautiful Stay,"We stayed here in May 2015 for a weekend getaway and shopping spree (Kildare Village). We loved it here, the rooms were lovely and the staff were very courteous. 

We also made use of the Spa facility and both had a back massage, which was truly amazing.

We will be back for sure.",5,2016,07,21
218,Beautiful hotel,"Attended a friends wedding here recently. The grounds and setting are beautiful, really gorgeous. All the food was fantastic. Every course was delicious. Could not fault this place - will happily return some day. :)",5,2016,07,21
218,Conor,"Wow, never again! Horrendous!!Jack's bar, staff missing most of the time, no atmosphere, too noisy even when sparsely occupied. Food mediocre. Bar reminded me of something you'd expect in an airport - extremely impersonal. Looked for the Snug Bar & was informed that it only opened on Fri & Sat but was now closed altogether and available just for private functions. Speaking of the airport analogy my room was as far away from the reception area as the Ryanair departure gates in Dublin Airport. Room was ok though. Now to another disappointment- The Spa & Leisure Centre..... First impression was the extremely unfriendly lady at reception whom I thought was unable to see me as she spoke AT me when I arrived and barely bade me the time of day. Then I saw the tattiness and, yes, dirt of the changing area with an odd mat scattered over the broken and lifted floor covering which appears to be like that for a considerable period of time. There were huge build ups of dust and gunge around the lockers where they met at corners that would immediately shut down a food outlet. Onto the gym area, not badly equipped to be fair but again very dirty with drinks bottle stains very prevalent on the treadmills which were not from today or yesterday. The treadmills I noticed ALL had their emergency safety cables wrapped up ""out of the way"" or even broken in one instance. Again the instructor staff were very eager not to meet your eye and actively engaged in staying out of your attention seeking quest for support. The pool area was just ok but I did notice signs stating that there was never a lifeguard on duty!!! I did look around to see if there was a defibrillator available but I could not see one and intended to ask on my way out but the receptionist was too busy speaking to a member of the beauty team that I just lost the will to live and left accordingly. Btw the external arrival area could do with a good clean up as it is quite dirty between litter and cigarette ends also the area outside leading back to the hotel is obviously the route to the delivery bays for the kitchen as I noticed the speed of the delivery vans passing and in particular a truck from La Rousse Foods which travelled past the door at a totally inappropriate speed for the surroundings, are they not aware of the pedestrian traffic here let alone the fact that there are quite a few young kids around. Anyway back to the critique, suffice to say I will not be back!",1,2016,07,21
218,Fantastic spot for family relaxation,"Stayed here for 2 days in July (unseasonal hot weather) while visiting the maze and Lullymore Park, and also very good shopping at Kildare Village Outlet Shopping! The hotel is very grand and enormous, but the staff are all very helpful and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble, the food choice at breakfast was great, and the restaurant food was fantastic, if a little slow when busy. The leisure facilities are amazing, full gym and at least 100 exercise machines, along with a 25m pool and kids pool next to sauna/jacuzzi facilities. Will definately not be staying anywhere else.",5,2016,07,20
218,Just driving by,"Looking for a place to stay and drove in here. It looked very exclusive but it's affordable. Well appointed room. Shower separate from the bath. Huge place and needed help to find room. Carpet hadn't been cleaned under curtains but otherwise can't fault. Bistro food was good only, without being great. Burger was so-so. Chicken wasn't succulent. Beer, wine and cheese so-so. Would stay again. Amazing grounds.",4,2016,07,20
218,Super overnight stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed an overnight stay with three friends after a visit to Kildare Shopping Village. On arrival reception staff were efficient and informative, public areas and bedrooms were clean and very comfortable, bathrooms were immaculate. Outside we enjoyed a pleasant stroll in the beautiful gardens and admired the many hanging baskets, flowers, shrubs and garden ornaments. Many photographs were taken. Food in the busy bistro was delicious and our waitresses were pleasant and attentive. Before breakfast one of my friends and I walked a short distance to the Leisure Club. My friend is a keen swimmer and she found the large 25 metre pool much to her liking. Breakfast was also delicious with a wide range of choices. We enjoyed a wonderful view of the gardens from our table. We will certainly return to this lovely old hotel.",5,2016,07,18
218,Never disappoints!,We stayed there at the weekend with out little girl and were as impressed as ever. Staff are lovely & hotel is fabulous. Had the most amazing dinner in Jack's bar & walks round the hotel grounds. We try and go twice a year and are already planning our next visit 😊,5,2016,07,18
218,Good potential but very disappointing,"Positive points: decoration in main rooms: just beautiful; delicious dinner at the bistro.
Disappointments: wifi reception (poor); bathroom (gunk between the tiles, traces of water everywhere on the floor and on the shower glass); carpet (smelling like old damp dog); staff (anonymous); well-be experience (the pretty pictures on the website refer to the spa space, not accessible if you don't book specific care treatment; the well-be space accessible to the guests is nothing more than a plain public swimming pool stinking of javel); service at the bistro (slow and poor, when asked for a bottle of water, the waitress took an unfinished bottle from the vacated table next to us!); internal accessibility (to join our room, we had to cross a reception room full of wedding guests).
Definitely NOT a four-star experience, much too expensive for the quality offered.",1,2016,07,17
218,Not very impressed ,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for two nights.  The hotel itself is nice, although it needs updated.  Was not impressed that we had to get two lifts to get to our floor.  The food in the bar was average, it was very slow service.  The spa was very disappointing, we had to pay an extra 10 euro each just to use the spa pool for 1 hour and 30 mins.  The hotel itself is very pricey and this should be included in the package.  On the upside the breakfast on both mornings was lovely.  Overall nice hotel, not much to do.  Will not be back.  ",2,2016,07,17
218,Great Hotel,"Just back a couple of days from Killashee and it's our second year going. The positives far outweigh the negatives, a few of the negatives include the noise of deliveries in the morning, walking through the middle of the car park to get to the pool, the noise of room service/housekeeping on the corridor at night! The noise issues are down to the Windows not closing fully and the gap at the top of the door onto the corridor!! I do think some of the decor could be updated a little. Room service food was poor, especially for the price of it!

The positives: the staff were very helpful, the pool and hydrotherapy suite were fab, Bar food and Breakfast buffet was excellent, the surroundings, the gardens, fairy garden, with swings, all excellent, children's play room, they have a children's club also but ours were too small. 

Great location for Dublin, Kildare Village, Newbridge (Silverware), lots of pet farms, Kildare Fresh Foods with Pet farm is excellent. 

The hotel itself is lovely and mentioning decor, although, would add significantly to the place is a minor detail.  

Really enjoyed our stay and intent on returning next year again.",4,2016,07,16
218,Girlie weekend,"Spent last night in killashee house hotel...lovely old fashioned hotel....we booked a triple room and it was 2double beds ..as sisters we didn't mind sharing, room was clean..only fault I have to find was there was only 2 of everything..cups, towels etc...we ate in the bar and the choices and food was good. Despite the fact that there was a couple of weddings on we had a great nights sleep. Breakfast the next morning was ok..I didn't think it was hot enough but choice was good .",4,2016,07,16
218,Wedding,"We stayed here as we were attending a hotel in the wedding. 

We weren't disappointed! The room was good, spacious! Only downside is the plumbing is very noisy! When you flush the toilet wake others up in the room. 

The food was very good. Staff also was excellent! Shame we didn't book to stay longer. ",4,2016,07,16
218,Jack's bar,"Just popped into Jack's bar for lunch. It's hard to beat Killashee hotel for its beautiful building and setting. Just gorgeous! So impressed by 2 members of staff - David and Virginia. They were not only friendly, but exceptional in their service and kindness. The crabmeat sandwich on delicious Guinness bread was a very small portion. Additional salad or two slices of sandwich are needed here. ",4,2016,07,15
218,"Allergy-friendly accommodations with excellent rooms, food & service","Our family of 4 stayed at the Killashee House Hotel and Spa Villa on June 29, 2016. We were traveling with a large group (~45), which always makes it more challenging for the restaurant staff. One of our family members has a fairly significant dairy and nut allergy, but the staff put us at ease. It was clear right away that they were knowledgeable and would communicate our daughter's dietary restrictions to the kitchen staff (a crucial connection that often breaks down).  They were attentive and wonderfully accommodating, making a special dessert to work around the allergies.  We had a wonderful stay!",5,2016,07,12
218,Nice rooms but awful food,"Positives - the rooms in this hotel are nice and modern. Sleep quality was very good and rooms / corridors were quiet. Although there was a wedding in the hotel both nights that I was there, I did not hear anything. There is also good wifi in the rooms.

Negatives - the food was absolutely awful. I ate 5 meals here over three days and I would not recommend this hotel because of its food. The vegetarian options were extremely carb heavy and the fish was of very poor quality. Even the scrambled egg in the morning was sitting there a long time and in my opinion was not edible. This hotel would seriously want to spend a lot of time reviewing food options and menus, particularly vegetarian options.",2,2016,07,11
218,Lovely stay but could have been better,"We stayed overnight on a bed breakfast and dinner package and the food for dinner in the restaurant was fantastic, amazing three course meal. We also had afternoon tea the following day which was very impressive and a real treat. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Only negative comments is that the images online of this hotel are of a small country hotel but the reality is hundreds of rooms and the new part of the hotel is somewhat underwhelming. It took a few minutes and an elevator to get from our room to the restaurant/reception area. The spa is across the carpark which is fine but again the pictures of the spa online were amazing and in reality the spa access which is included in the package is only to the pool/sauna/steam room/jacuzzi whilst the impressive hydrotherapy pool etc is behind closed doors and an extra €20 a head - this was quite misleading. The woodland walks etc are very short and should be extended so there is more to do outside the hotel.",3,2016,07,11
218,world class,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights,after travelling in the UK for 5 weeks, this was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Location, amenities and staff were all of the highest quality, I would recommend  this hotel to everyone. Another plus for me was the extent  of the garden, so beautiful.",5,2016,07,06
218,"Bedrooms to hard to get too, Food quality not good","Went to a wedding recently and found it very hard to locate the bedrooms, it was all over the place..
The food was very poor-The beef and veg was not good at all.
On a the plus side the staff were great",2,2016,07,04
218,Charming hotel and am amazing setting,"Stayed here overnight whilst on business. The hotel is set in an amazing garden and has a real charm to the place.

The staff a friendly and helpful and the bistro has great food and service.

Rooms are modern and comfortable.

One slight disappointment was breakfast. It doesn't start until 07:00 which makes it a little rushed for me to be at work on time. I got the breakfast room just before 7 and ended up waiting until gone 7. 

Will defiantly be happy to stay here again.",5,2016,07,03
218,Lunch get together,Had booked a table for 12 people. Service was very slow and we were not offered a drink. The food was not great for a 4/5 star hotel. It was also overpriced. It's not the first time I have eaten a meal here and I wasn't impressed the first time and most definitely not impressed the second time. I will not be returning for food here again. In saying that the staff were very friendly and helpful. ,2,2016,06,30
218,"Turners Restaurant, Killashee House Hotel, Naas","I have to comment on the marvellous dining experience we had in Turners Restaurant recently. The menu surpassed all expectations with each course better than the last, if possible. Waiting staff were attentive without being intrusive which is great when you don't get nights out with husband that often! Amuse bouche started off the evening very well by being incredibly tasty -  a very good start which set the tone for more to follow. Cooking was accomplished and certainly comparable to some (not enough) of the Michelin establishments we have dined in, both Ireland and abroad. There was nothing to fault. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds, lovely for a stroll on a Summers' evening. Luckily we are near enough to visit more often but, even if we were further away, the food alone would be well worth an overnight break. Fantastic!",5,2016,06,29
218,Wedding,"We had our wedding at Killashee on June 4th this year. The venue, wedding co-ordinator Katie, staff and food were all first class. You made it a day to remember. Andrew really added to this on the day. His organisation kept us at ease and let the party run into the early hours. I would highly recommend Killashee as a wedding venue - it is speculator. Thank you all so much for making our special day one to remember forever Kate & Donal xxx",5,2016,06,28
218,Very relaxing.,"Really lovely hotel .Beautiful grounds and gardens. Very pleasant and helpful staff. We got a beautiful big suite ,robes, jacuzzi bath. Menu in the Bistro was limited 4choices if it was included in your package. It was good. Live music Friday and Saturday night , it was very good. Would definitely return hopefully soon. Excellent wifi .",5,2016,06,28
218,Mr ,"Both myself and wife were invited to the son of friends wedding whom we met on a visit to the carribean from Dublin normally we would stayed with in a town called blessington which is close by but with here family over from England she had no room for us not that we would have stayed with them anyway as it would have been not approiate to stay with considering they had a wedding to put over, anyway we stayed in the killashee house hotel as that was the venue for the wedding anyway we stayed for two nights and it was amazing in every respect from the stay to the wedding beautiful place staff warm and friendly the service good and food excellent well worth a try ",5,2016,06,28
218,Overnight stay - B & B,"Had an overnight stay (B&B) following attendance at a wedding. Spacious comfortable room, great selection of food at breakfast. Super venue for wedding reception. Good service, good food, very comfortable.",5,2016,06,27
218,perfect wedding at the killashee,we had our wedding at the killashee on 5th june and from the moment we had our initial look round the hotel everything about it was perfect the staff were so professional and extremely helpful in the planning and they had every detail covered from the food to the accomodation and thanks to them the weekend of the wedding went perfectly.One of the best part of the planning was the menu tasting 3 months before the wedding where we were able to taste 4 different main courses starters and desserts not to mention several different wines ! also the waiting staff on the night were excellent and gave us great advice and information on what to pick. For the wedding itself we had the ceremony in the belling suite which is a fabulous room and just perfect for the 70 guests we had.The reception was in the original house which is just a stunning setting for a wedding the food and drink from the drinks reception through the dinner and the evening food was amazing and the acomodation in the house was top class large luxourious rooms with extra bedding provided by the hotel where needed all our guests had a wonderful time the buffet breakfasts in the restaurant was also very good with plenty of choice and we also had a champagne breakfast in bed on our second morning and an evening meal included the next day the gym and pool were excellent very well equipped and very clean as was the rest of the hotel the gardens are magnificent and theres plenty of places for the kids to hide and play as well as a small play park I couls go on and on about how good this place is but the best thing about it has to be the staff from the front desk to the banquetting staff to the leisure centre they were all very friendly and very professional special thanks to katie and lisa marie who helped us plan the wedding and their attention to detail made sure that the whole weekend went perfectly for ourselves and all our guests and thanks also to andrew the duty manager on the day of the wedding for looking after us so well the killashee is a fantastic hotel in every way and i would highly highly recommend it as a wedding venue if you want a perfect day thanks again killashee,5,2016,06,26
218,No regrets,"The shower makes it seems like the hotel was built on a geyser. Ask for he first floor so there will be no heating problems. The friendly staff can advise you on what to do for fun and arrange for a taxi ride to your destination. 
Take a walk around the beautiful compound or treat yourself to some time in the spa.  
The town of Naas is very friendly and will make you feel right at home.",5,2016,06,22
218,Amazing find,"Kilashee was fantastic . The spa was the best I have been in and he treatments second to none . The staff in the hotel were amazing in all areas and very well trained . 
A beautiful destination for a wedding / a spa break or just a lovely weekend .",5,2016,06,22
218,Confused,"Beautiful gardens and walks around the hotel.  The hotel is large with not a lot to do.  Rooms are clean spacious and old styled, has tea and coffee facilities which is always a plus.  Restaurant is shared with the bar with large tv playing football so not very relaxing.  Food and service was good and staff professional.  Girl that checked us in at reception was pleasant and friendly.  Had a spa day booked. Spa is seperate from hotel, clean and treatments were excellent, no complaints.  Overall feel this hotel is just for a one night stay, was bored come second night. Most definitely a conference hotel, has a lot of conferences and large parties in the bar.   ",3,2016,06,22
218,Not for me,"This is as impressive a property as you are likely to come across gardens are magnificent however the rest falls disappointingly flat 
Room was o k if a little dark the breakfast was one of those buffet things I detest but it was not even. A good one go for the cooked to order option it has to be better  all in all lawlors is probably a better option pity the initial impression was so good ps I didn't use the spa ",3,2016,06,22
218,Fab Relaxing Hotel & Wasnt Disappointed.,"Have stayed here before for a wedding.  But this was just a break away with a friend.  And would highly recommend it for a relaxing leisurely break.  We got a deal of €220 for the room for two people, with breakfast and dinner in the Bistro.  GREAT value.  Room was lovely, they had the window open so the room was quite chilled, which I like!  Spotlessly clean & very big double bed (was sharing with a friend, and we never met in the night lol!).  Dinner in the Bistro was 3 courses with tea/coffee.  Great value and very tasty for an ""added"" dinner.  Choice of 4 starters, 4 mains and 4 desserts.  All 3 courses were tasty and filling.  Dessert was divine, couldn't finish it!  Key Lime Pie in a Jar with mini Meringues on top and ice-cream!  Delish!!  We had use of the Thermal Spa for an extra €10, 1&half hours.  And breakfast was gorgeous the next morning.  So much on offer, a hot breakfast, fruit, pastries etc.  Would highly recommend this place for a relaxing night away with your partner or your girlfriends.  Luxury but affordable.  The only negative I had was that our room was a bit of a trek, as a lift was out of service (these things happen) but sure we got our steps in!",5,2016,06,22
218,Won't Be Back!,"This was our first weekend away since becoming a family of three and I must say I was extremely disappointed with the service and lack of attention when it came to the basics.  We had booked this stay expecting to treat ourselves to a bit of luxury but were let down several times.  
Our room was a little small with the travel cot and there wasn't a lot of storage, the décor was a little dated but the beds were very comfortable.  
The food and service in the restaurant wasn't at the standard we expected as we had to ask three times for the bottle of wine we ordered but it didn't come until after we received our main. 
There's a small walk around the front of the hotel which is nice with a Butterfly garden but back area is just like a service entry where there is access to the hotel pool and spa in a separate building.  
There was also a problem with the lift to our floor one of the days of our stay, not good with a baby and buggy.
Both mornings we had breakfast, once in the dining hall and once as room service, on each occasion our order was incorrect.  
Upon check-out we received the worst customer service as the staff member didn't even raise her head from her computer or even ask if we had a nice stay, she just took my money and gave me a receipt.  We were in the car heading out of town when we then got a call to ask if they should charge our card for payment as we had already left.  I told them to check their records as I had just paid cash 10 minutes prior.  I then complained and the girl said she would get someone to call me back.  I received a call from a duty manager who listened to all the concerns of our stay and said she would pass them on to another manager.  I got a call the next day from another lady who didn't know any of my complaints and had to explain myself all over again, a complete waste of my time.  
I think customer service needs to be a real focus area for this hotel to improve.  If large weddings/parties in a busy lobby and bar is the atmosphere they are trying to create then they would need to hire more staff to cater for the lone traveller or weekend day tripper. I felt as because I was a once off visitor I didn't matter as much as a larger party or regular.
Not one to complain ( getting a call when we were on our way home asking for payment was the tipping point) we usually let the little things slide so its even disappointing for us to have this experience.  I would say better to find somewhere a little more personal where you will feel welcomed for giving them €200+!!!",2,2016,06,21
218,Weekend stay at Killashee House,I would like to say this is an amazing hotel. I stayed here for 1 night as a surprise for my wife for her birthday. It was a 1 night stay with Dinner and Breakfast. We got an amazing room so happy with it all perfect. All the staff are very friendly. I could not fault it i paid the extra for a suit and we got room 339 it was a massive Room but so nice to experience a bit of luxury. Thanks very much I will recommend this hotel to all.,5,2016,06,20
218,Splendid in every way.....,"Was at a wedding.... marvellous cocktails on the lawn on arrival.... generously spacious and equipped bedroom, biggest most comfortable beds I have ever seen...the meal was the best I have ever experienced at an event....the service was excellent everywhere...made all the more enjoyable in that all staff I encountered were Irish,an unusual experience in 21st century Ireland where Polish and Mandarin are the most spoken languages after English....all topped off the following morning with a breakfast of smoked mackerel and poached egg.. room for improvement in quality of coffee!",5,2016,06,19
218,Just OK. ,Had 2 night stay here beginning of June.  Overall nice hotel but place needs some refurbishment.  Trek to reception and gym from rooms is a bit crazy. But you do get used to the maze eventually.  Really good breakfast. ,3,2016,06,19
218,Lovely hotel ,Visited for the second time in the past year. On the second visit the room was of a very high standard and seemed to be recently refurbished. Dinner in the bar was very good as was breakfast the following morning. Will definitely return again soon. ,5,2016,06,17
218,Great Hotel & great food,"We stayed last year for one night to celebrate my wifes birthday. We had dinner in the main room, the food was excellent, they welcome us to the table with a glass of prosecco etc,,,it was lovely, staff were super helpful, we will be back. thank you",4,2016,06,16
218,Too many disappointing factors to know I don't want to return to this hotel again...,"I was really looking forward to my visit to Killashee house, the website certainly impresses. It's a different picture when you are staying there. We booked in for a romantic getaway. It's not romantic!  It's a big business hotel churning out weddings, parties, christenings, meetings etc. it's busy, noisy and doesn't seem to quite know what it is??

For me, it was a big soulless hotel and it frustrated me the more time I spent there. Another reviewer described it as 'Faulty Towers', I don't know if it's quite that however, the frustration you feel for the guests while watching Faulty Towers is what I was experiencing at Killashee. Our room was a very long walk from reception, the lift was broken. Even when the lift was in operation, our room was still the same distance away but no stair climbing involved. Floors are listed as 1 for level 0, 2 for level 1, the preset numbers on the room telephones are not correct, the brochures in the rooms contain no useful information so you have to call reception to find out basic questions...little things but other hotels get these things right...

Positives- the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the building is stunning and decor is gorgeous, of a high quality and very well maintained. The rooms were of a high standard, we stayed in a superior room. The food was okay, it was basic but tasty. The pool and gym facilities are very good but separate to the hotel so you cannot go from the room in your robe as you need to go outside.

What about returning here? ...The question that popped into my mind here was 'What is this hotel?' It's got an old world feel but parts are modern. Paper signs directing you to all the various parties taking place there, makes it feel very unwelcoming. It's also very much a local hotel, lots of Sunday lunch, kids running about so I certainly didn't feel it was in any way luxurious or exclusive, the website misleads here!

The hotel bar and restaurant just off the main reception is cold and it reminds me of a coffee shop, I just could not relax in there.  It's noisy and seating arrangements not intimate. The outside courtyard, while covered over, gets flooded in rain shower as the excess water runs into the seating area, we had to move!

The wait staff were friendly but need training as they were unable to advise on dishes or wine etc. 

This hotel could certainly do with a few expert opinions and needs to make a few changes, if these were made,  it could be a great hotel as it has so much potential.

Sadly, I won't be going back to this hotel and wouldn't feel confident recommending this hotel either. It costs way more than it was worth and your € is so much better spent in other hotels in Ireland....",2,2016,06,14
218,Lovely Hotel - just outside Naas,"Stayed here for two nights in June 2016. Larger than we expected, but good atmosphere and staff helpful and keen to offer good customer service.

 Room a fair way from reception desk and two lifts required. The room was spacious and well equipped. 

 Breakfast in dining room was good quality & buffet style. Dined in the Bistro - all fine",4,2016,06,13
218,Fantastic staff,"We stayed in the original house in room 283. We were there for my brothers wedding. We had an amazing weekend. There were 2 adults and 3 children aged 9, 12 and 16 and everyone had a great time. The room was lovely and peaceful. We had loads of space. My 9 year old was most impressed with the large bath !  It was incredibly clean throughout. The grounds around the hotel are stunning and the kids loved playing and finding little nooks and crannys to hide in. The pool and gym were fantastic , again very clean. The food was amazing couldn't find fault at all. But the mot impressive of all has to be the staff. They are all so pleasant , helpful , smiley and the kids thought they were good craic especially the waiters at the wedding !!  Thank you all for making our stay so wonderful.",5,2016,06,13
218,Great place for a wedding,"Visited for a wedding, it is an extremely well run place. All the staff are friendly and it is not too stuffy. The food and presentation was excellent. It was great to see young staff working there, it added a vibrancy to the place and the place can only benefit from that. The decor and fittings is very traditional and it makes the place stand out as a great wedding venue. Can't fault the place thanks for the day!",5,2016,06,12
218,"Great facade, quite bland!","What can I say, looks great from the outside but quite frankly its just a big bland souless hotel.  We had afternoon tea, well they need to send a manager to experience a proper afternoon tea at somewhere like Mulberry House in Ongar, Essex.  They could learn a lot. Would not stay there again and not recommend.",3,2016,06,09
218,A beautiful place,"We had a gorgeous night here. A stunning building on beautiful grounds, it's perfect. The bedroom was lovely, clean and v warm. We had breakfast which was fab. There was a huge selection and the dining room is lovely. All the staff we met were really nice. I really want to return",5,2016,06,08
218,Beautiful ,"I have been here a couple of times for functions, weekend spa breaks and sometimes just for lunch or dinner. Their restaurants are beautiful but I feel more comfortable with the casual dining than the haute cuisine. I feel the quality of their rooms can vary, some are in need of some TLC. Their spa is great but it's a bit of a pain to stay in the hotel and walk across the car park in Irish weather to get to it ",4,2016,06,06
218,Lovely Hotel but some issues,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel over the weekend.    The person whom i was in contact with for the reservation via email was excellent and helped me with the numerous questions i had for her.    The hotel itself is lovely, our 2 interconnecting rooms were perfect and we had complimentary robes/slippers and chocolates.    The rooms are a good distance from the reception and as the lift was broken on day 1 it did mean a lot of climbing up and down the stairs to get to reception from the room.    Breakfast was lovely in Turners restaurant and we had no complaints there.    The bistro bar/restaurant was poorly run we felt.    When we went down for our dinner on the second evening the restaurant area was quite, the lady handed us a menu with 4 starters/4 mains and 4 deserts - as there wasn't anything on this menu that we liked i asked could we pick from the other menu that was shown outside the bar, we could but it was a pity she had not shown us this menu in the beginning rather than having to ask for it.    The food itself was fine - we felt that the staff were very inexperienced, when we ordered our bottle of wine the server brought it to the table, never asked did we want to sample same and didn't even pour our first glasses for us.  As we proceeded with our meal over the space of 10  minutes 4 different servers asked us was our meal ok which was very strange.
After our dinner we decided to have a drink at the bar, the hotel boasts a large cocktail menu so 2 members of the party decided they would have cocktails - this provided to be a bad idea - it took 2 staff members to make the cocktails and they really didn't seem to know what ingredients went into each cocktail and really the cocktails were not up to standard.    The bar staff again seemed to be very inexperienced with names of drinks and how to charge a drink to your room.   The area was not busy at the time but there was a lot of staff on hand.

Overall this is a lovely hotel and i would return, the Bistro bar/restaurant did let it down for us and we were glad we only dined there on 1 evening and decided to eat out the other evening.   The only other fault was that the fire alarm went off at about 8 am on the first morning which from reading other reviews has happened before.",3,2016,06,01
218,Brillant,"We had our Daughters Holy Communion party last Sunday and the food, service, staff were alll amazing. Kim was the lady who organised it all for us as we live in the UK and she emailed on a regular basis since easter. they made the cake and lovely flowers and arrangments on each table. We stayed for 2 nights and the breakfast was yum also. Would Highly recommend the Irish Hospitality even thought I am Irish myself. Booking for Christmas soon. Thank You Killashee.",5,2016,05,31
218,"Fantastic Hotel, great food, great service!","We have just spent a great weekend with family and friends to celebrate our sons Confirmation. The staff couldn't be more helpful, excellent staff and great food with all requests being handled with a smile. Will definitely be back even if it is to sample one of the best pints of Guinness I have had!",5,2016,05,29
218,Weekend at the races,"A party of 8 of us stayed here over the weekend on a trip to the curragh and Irish national stud.
Lovely rooms nice bar/ restaurant although the layout of the hotel takes a while to get used to.
The gardens are well kept and all staff very friendly. 
The breakfast is excellent with buffet or you can order from the menu.
All in all a nice stay was had by all.",4,2016,05,25
218,I Made a Vow!,"In the area at Johnstown Garden Centre I saw the sign for Killashee Hotel which I was familiar with by buying a gift voucher fadó fadó! As soon as I drove in I felt this place was special not knowing then that it once was a onvent! Had the chicken breast filleted with bone with mushroom duxelle plus smooth mash which was tasty and freshly cooked! Dessert was a large portion of inhouse bakewell tart but as I did not like it served with chocolate ice cream I had no problem changing same!  The staff very pleasant,experienced & showed no bad ""habits!  I am looking forward to staying next time and walking the beautiful gardens away from my ""Office""and lights out early;-) ",5,2016,05,24
218,Beautiful room but  cold and no hot water in the evening @ 6pm or @ 8am,"Stayed on Saturday night during the Irish open in the K Club. Came back from the golf to find no hot water and a cold room. Not sure if the leak from the roof  outside our room was the reason???

Fire alarm went off @ 4am !!!

The lift  was broken !

Yes I was sorry I wasted €165 for the room and a €100 on a mealI should have gone home and have come back down for the golf the next day!!!! 

This is my first negative review.",2,2016,05,22
218,Bistro lunch for 12 ,"Booked lunch here for a family celebration. Surroundings nice, good parking and access for disabled patrons. But really not a great dining experience. Service is average and slow. Food is shockingly overpriced in the bistro. The special was salmon with Spanish rice. Which was a small salmon darn with literally one tablespoon of rice on the side and two asparagus tips draped over the salmon. €18 !! €13 for a toasted club sandwich with some chips on the side !!! Don't get me started on the price of the drinks !!! All told had a lovely day but felt it was way overpriced for what it is. Would only go back because it is wheelchair accessible and suitable for a large party. Would go elsewhere for a dining experience or good value.",3,2016,05,21
218,Very Pleasant Stay,"Was here for 1 night on business. My wife and I stayed in a very large bedroom with excellent facilities. Clean and tidy with a comfy bed. We had a relative join us for Dinner and very enjoyable it was. Good food, friendly staff and a reasonable cost.

Never had chance to look at Health Spa, but will hopefully go back for a long weekend with friends.

Getting to our room was a little confusing, up in one lift, walk to another, then down a floor!",4,2016,05,18
218,Lovely hotel but rooms far away from reception,Stayed here recently and the sun was shining which made it so much more pretty! The rooms are a bit away from the reception and it's a bit confusing getting to the rooms. There was a wedding on the night I stayed and noise was an issue. Best asking for quiet room if not attending a function! Food is lovely. ,4,2016,05,18
218,Average hotel,"Hotel is lovely, but food and service is average.  Stayed here a few years ago and was much better.  I am ceiliac and Was given very little choice, staff had little understanding of the disease . Had soup, grilled chicken and mash for dinner, that's all they could offer me in a 4star hotel? No sweet. For breakfast I was told I could have all the hot food but later after checking before I ate anything was told that was wrong and I could only have bacon egg and tomato. Was given gluten free bread but found out too late that it had been toasted on the regular toast racking machine. Suffered for the whole day after that.",3,2016,05,17
218,Beautiful grounds and gardens,We had a lovely stay in Killashee. As you drive into the hotel its very impressive with the beautiful grounds and gardens. The ground floor has the wow factor and I can understand why they get so many weddings. Signage to rooms and back to reception are a little confusing. Our room had a lovely view of the gardens.,4,2016,05,10
218,Amazing hotel and fabulous staff,"I booked a night away as a surprise for my wife for our anniversary. I booked the spa and dinner package. 
On arrival at the spa we were seen to quickly. we spent some time in the relaxation suite and then down for our treatments, I had a head massage and a back massage and it was bliss.
We then went to our room and we were after being upgraded to a suite as it was our anniversary. This was a lovely touch.

Dinner and food were fab and everything was served with a smile.

We will be back again",5,2016,05,09
218,A 5 Star experience,Hotel is just beautiful. Gardens are very well maintained. Staff are very welcoming. Lovely food in restaurant. Furniture of good quality. Interior and exterior don't disappoint. Just off the motorway but in the heart of the country.,5,2016,05,06
218,Wonderful Visit,"Stayed overnight after a wonderful dinner in their excellent Restaurant.  Beautiful relaxing ambience at the hotel and dinner was gorgeous.  The service and attention was excellent also.  The room was larger than usual, large double beds rather than small twins, which was a welcome change.  Lovely gardens attached, to take a leisurely walk and afternoon tea/coffee afterwards.  My only negative was that the bar was sandwiched between two eating areas (no diners at the time) which meant it had no atmosphere of its own.   I felt the bar should be at one end only and it closed early which was most strange.  We had to finish drinks in the lobby which was not nice at all, with people coming and going.  Still don't understand why the bar closed before normal finishing time.  A disappointment in an otherwise lovely visit!",5,2016,05,05
218,lovely staff,"we had a great stay in this old fashioned charming Hotel, all staff were excellent notably reception and the bar staff, particularly the elder gent behind the bar was most helpful and friendly

such a beautiful place and the gardens are wonderful and food is great",5,2016,05,05
218,"Large, beautiful hotel - Great location for the races!","This was our first visit to the Kilashee Hotel for the Punchestown Gold Cup.  We arrived on the Monday and was warmly greeted by the Reception staff who also offered us a glass of fizz in their lovely conservatory after we had dropped our bags in our large room.  This hotel is large - every public room has at least one chandelier in.  We took a wonder round the place after dinner one day and were astounded as to how many meeting rooms and ball rooms they had!  All beautifully decorated.  Dinner was in the Bistro / Bar, which again is very roomy.  Food was good and the waiting staff were again very attentive and friendly.  For the race days, the hotel has their own free shuttle bus, but before we got on that there were complimentary fizz and canapes and met by the hotel management (as Killashee were sponsoring one of the races on the 1st day).  The choice at breakfast was vast - something for everyone and was served again in a beautiful large morning room.  We loved this hotel and next time we visit we will certainly make use of the large gym and pool which is next door in another building.",5,2016,05,05
218,Very good,My friend & I stayed here for a girlie night last year. Room was lovely & spacious. Two double beds! Very clean. Food in restaurant both at dinner & breakfast was excellent. There was music in bar which was lively and very enjoyable. Staff were really lovely. Really look forward to returning. ,4,2016,05,04
218,Excellent food and venue. ,"Visited the hotel restaurant to meet with friends. Menu, venue and food were beautiful. The staff were attentive and helpful. I would be happy to visit this premises again as I have done on many occasions. My one and only complaint is that the Restaurant Manager exhibited a degree of unwarranted rudeness towards the hotel residents, (who complained at the reception desk later) that we were dining with. ",5,2016,05,04
218,Stay at Kilashee was excellent!,We had booked 2 rooms room 124 A family room with 2 King size bed and single bed the room far out weighed my expectations just stunning also Room 2 room 214 for family friend he had 2 double bed all to himself both rooms had to DVD water slippers bathrobes was extremely impressed,5,2016,05,03
218,High Quality of service and food,"Came here on a quite Friday evening for our first date in nearly a year and was greeted by Ciara who seated us at our table quickly. me and my partner ordered steaks, which were perfectly cooked and was well worth the money.  very succulent  !!!!!! desserts were very well presented and tasted fantastic. Ciara and Sorcha went out of there way to look after us and make our date night fantastic!!! noting was to much trouble for them and they made us feel very welcome. only thing that put me off was the fact that the restaurant manager/ supervisor was shouting at the staff across the room to polish wine glasses as it wasn't busy before she went of with a plate of food pretty sure she could of asked them in a more discreet, professional and pleasant manner !!!! also it was a little cold in the restaurant!! overall the experience was amazing and i have been recommending it to my friends.... will definitely be returning... keep up the good work both staff and chefs!!!!!",4,2016,05,03
218,Brilliant Atmosphere,"Fantastic trip for the races with friends 

Excellent atmosphere great service and great craic 

Peter and Hugh in the Bar were excellent all week knew My order by the second day 

Cocktail menu and whiskey selection much better than previous years 

Will Def be back",5,2016,05,03
218,Family Lunch - Christmas 2015,"I just want write about the tremendous experience myself and my family had at the Killashee on the 18th December, 2015. I know that is very late but was going through my list of things to do and found that I had not written this review. It is mainly about two people - Thomas Carney and Aveta Szymanska. There is nothing they would not do. We had a set Christmas lunch in a private room and Thomas was our dedicated waiter. Thomas, you were outstanding in the service you provided and we had such a lovely time. Thank you both so much.",5,2016,05,01
218,Great return visit,"Stayed for the 3rd year in a row for Punchestown festival, the rooms are lovely, large and roomy, great to catch up with regular guests who also stay every year, only one moan was the live music was moved upstairs which takes away the atmosphere in the bar and a bit Leary walking through rather drunk guests when it's bedtime ... Also the restaurant menu was not as good as last few years , less choice and not so good as past years, the bonus was meeting the lovely Thomas a young waiter who was so helpful and polite , he needs a special pat on the back !!",4,2016,05,01
218,christmas,fantastic!!! stayed with family home from Sydney!! there were 17 of us and we sat at big table and the service was amazingly quick and great staff so big and rooms great only bit of a distance away from reception and breakfast area which was worth the walk!!! no complaints !!!! separate ares for buy as you go lunch n drinks!! definatly recommend it!!luxery!! only downside was it has a pool but you have to cross the yard to get there!! worth it as BIG but it was raining when we had to cross!!,5,2016,04,27
218,Mediocre at best,"I and my family stayed here over the Easter break and when we first drove up I thought looks great.  The reception is nice, the staff pleasant and the overall impression I was pleased; then we checked in.  The hotel started to look like an old folks home after the reception, the room dated, the beds like boards.  We asked for a family room as we have two young children and requested a fridge upon booking as our kids love milk and yoghurt's.  The fridge was tiny, I mean the 2ltrs of milk filled it.  After a long drive our kids wanted to use the pool, off we set with excited (dressed in swimming gear) children only to discover the pool/spa isn't in the hotel but across a car park in the lashing rain.  If I had booked this as a spa break I would not be pleased!! 

So later we decided to have dinner in the bistro/bar area.  We ordered and my daughters dinner came 10mins later mine and my wifes dinner came, when we had nearly finished our sons dinner came (he had been eating some of our daughters chips while we waited).  The waiting staff had no lead, the kitchen unprepared and general chaos ensued.  

Next morning my wife went for a walk while I looked after the kids in the room.  ""Have a nice walk dear?"" ""No"" she replied ""The grounds are creepy and sinister. I don't know where the acres of walks are but they aren't here.""  

Next night one good point the hotel had was a kids club, we took advantage of this service as it looked well run with someone on the door checking people in and out. 
Off we went for dinner in the bistro/bar again (just a stones throw from the kids club).  We got seated and ordered our meal.  A few minutes later we decided to order wine and a pint.  Dinner came and we thought Hmm where are the drinks, so we ate a bit chatted still no drinks, tried to get someone's attention but again chaos ensued in the restaurant.  We finished our dinner and the drinks arrived?!  

The hotel is well situated for travelling about, the staff are nice but the place needs money spent on it.  When we were checking out I was going to complain but heard the woman before me say the exact same thing I was going to say so I didn't bother, the manageress was dealing with her and told her to stay for TripAdvisor and they would sort her out next time she booked.  I won't be back and didn't look for a freebie.",3,2016,04,26
218,Top notch from start to finish,Myself and the boss decided to treat ourselves to a spa day in kilashee and spent the night before in the hotel. The grounds are fantastic and well maintained and the staff are very friendly and well turned out. Big thanks to Naomi on reception who was brilliant and extremely helpful ( a credit to the hotel). Stayed in a deluxe suite and the room was spotless. Had dinner that night and were very well looked after. Food was great too. Got up early and used the gym facilities. Gym is very well stocked with everything you would need and plenty of machines. Very impressed. The spa treatments themselves were a1. The girl who gave me my massage was very understanding that it was my first ever (not my last). All in all it was a fantastic two days and kilashee should be very proud of their staff and the effort they put in to make the guests stay extra special,5,2016,04,25
218,Another fantastic family break in a very special place,"We have been coming to Killashee for about 14 years for short family breaks a few times each year - it is one of the few places that my family consistently agrees on visiting and as there are 6 of us ranging in age from 5-45 years that is no mean feat - it really is like a home-from-home for us. This is my first review as it really deserves a special mention for the new additions made with children in mind. Specifically the kids high-tea and movie nights run during the school holidays. Run by a wonderful mum and daughter duo, Alison and Emily do their upmost to ensure that the children are well fed, entertained, and safe in their care. My children had such a super time that by the end of the week they didn't want to have dinner with us - preferring to go to the kids club instead. Knowing that they were safe and well cared for, enabled us to relax and enjoy a glass of wine in the gallery lounge. The fairy garden with play area was put to good use with a picnic and rug on one of the lovely sunny days over Easter, there really is no place like the beautiful gardens of Killashee on a good day.   With thanks to Dee Nix for facilitating at a very busy time, we extended our stay as we were all very chilled and couldn't face heading home - thats the Killashee effect that we have come to appreciate!  Attentive staff, good quality fresh food and wine, well cared-for children and a very clean swimming pool - we are looking forward to our return journey during the summer. xx",5,2016,04,25
218,Easter weekend,"This hotel is set in its own grounds surrounded by pleasant parkland walks.  It used to be a former school so the building is quite old and sprawled out.  It has wide vacuum of spaces spread out over different floors and their floor numbers were very haphazard i.e. lift from ground to 3rd then down another lift to 2nd! Corridors are very long and reasonable distances require to be walked to get to your room (after navigating the lift system).  Our room was large but quite dated and too warm.  One large restaurant/bar area with reasonably limited menu.  First night service was very slow.  Well located with regard to Newbridge Silver, Irish National Stud and Japanese Gardens and the Kildare Outlet Village (latter of which I was very disappointed in and would not be in a hurry to return to).  The spa in the hotel is in a separate building at the back of the hotel grounds and the thermal spa was quite pleasant.  Overall an average hotel but unless in the area and needed an overnight, probably would not be in a hurry to return to.",3,2016,04,25
218,wedding,"Fantastic stay, wonderful food, very attentive staff (even if some orders were forgotten about,  but that didn't put us off) , great hospitality throughout the stay! Would recommend.  
Plenty of stairs to work off breakfast!",5,2016,04,25
218,Staff:lovely mostly.  Decor:Lovely mostly,"I stayed in Killashee House for a weekend wigh some friends. Overall we had a lovely time. The view of the hotel on arrival is fabulous. ...very impressive building.  The fovaye doesn't disappoint either....all velvet and chandeliers and mirrors. Stunning and opulent. But this leads to a really big let down when you get to your room...or at least ours. The room was very basic. ..no glamour at all.It was very clean, as was the bathroom but there were little chips off some of the bathroom furniture. .the furniture in general was a bit tatty....disappointing.  We had food in the bistro as part of our package which was ok. My vegetarian main course was very bland....However my lime pot dessert more than made up for it. The staff at reception were polite only. I forgot my phone charger and there was none I coukd borrow which I thought was incredible noting the size of the hotel. The waiting staff however were lovely on both nights and at breakfast. Breakfast was also lovely and plentiful despite there having been two weddings on the Saturday. Overall it was lovely.",4,2016,04,25
218,Fine & Dine,"Very good one night stay for the family. Room was old style, spacious & clean while the main building entailed some fine architectural features all of which added to a nice stay. Good choice of foods for breakfast in a spacious area. Later in the day after checking out we dined in the bar/ lounge which too was nicely decorated while the food was good also & the staff looked after us. Next time we are in this area, we will call in again",5,2016,04,25
218,Super friendly & helpful staff,"Stayed here last week whilst working on an event and the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful - nothing was too much bother for them. The hotel itself is stunning, beautifully restored and has great facilities. Perfect for conference functions and the most idyllic wedding venue.",5,2016,04,24
218,Poor Service!!!,"Not a good stay for me and certainly the worst place I have stayed in Ireland. Really well presented hotel in nice grounds with a grand country house feel but that's where the positive ends! Rooms were only OK and nothing more the staff at reception were polite but not helpful and breakfast was a disaster; Read the breakfast menu located in my room the evening before as I arrived late at the hotel and the restaurant has stopped serving - impressive read and was looking forward to it so was there bright and early - waited to be seated which was quick and painless and was asked if I wanted Coffee or Tea and this was served at my table pretty promptly. I sat there reading emails for 30 minutes awaiting my server to return so that I could order from that exciting menu I read the evening before - well I was looking around trying to capture his attention while he was seating other guests but no joy - after 45 minutes I left as I had a meeting to make and that's when I saw the buffet breakfast set up behind where I was seated. Maybe my mistake but really disappointed I was not informed this by the check in staff or the person who sat me and to be honest if I was aware it was a buffet I would not have eaten anyhow - I had a menu in my room, I was sat (with my back to the buffet) at the restaurant when I arrived for breakfast and I was served coffee, why would I guess it was self service!",2,2016,04,23
218,Very nice,"Visited for a spa day which was really really enjoyable. I often don't remember spa days very well because I go into zombie mode but this was a really nice one. I popped over to the hotel who refused to serve me a pint because I was not a resident of the hotel, even though I was a paying guest. This was a first that I've been refused a drink at a hotel......anyway. Everything else was great",4,2016,04,22
218,Only ok,"We manage an annual escape once a year as a group of ladies - we like to go somewhere with good food and a spa/leisure area to chat and catch up and we can only normally manage one night. We previously stayed in the Killashee on the same basis but this time I felt I really had to comment. 
The positives first - reception staff were excellent and  the dinner and the breakfast were very good. The negatives ? I first stayed in the Killashee about 12 years ago and unless I am mistaken the décor, carpets etc. have not changed.  The place has a really dated feel to it and needs some money spent on it badly.  The rooms are decent in size but furniture is dated and well worn, 
We had booked treatments as part of our package and they pushed access to the  new hydro suite as part of the deal  - it is tiny - only 4 beds which were either in use or with used towels, magazines on them so you did not know whether to use them on not, a very small pool area with various jets, but if someone in the adjoining area was using the jets there - the water diverted and landed on you in your area - steam room was fine but the drinking water machine stopped working and the changing rooms are tiny.  There was no evidence of any on-going sprucing up going on and it definitely was not a place that would encourage relaxation.  We have stayed in proper spa hotels before and this is not a proper spa and therefore the 'double billing' is misleading - the changing room rooms for the spa and treatment areas are also tiny and the waiting area outside is very public and cold.
Before dinner we attempted to get a drink in the upstairs lobby - despite three members of staff chatting behind the bar no one came near us - my friend went up and asked for the dirty table we were sitting at to be cleared off - a lady came over to do that but just took away the glasses and empty bottles, did not wipe the table and also did not come back to ask us what we wanted - after 10 min of waiting we just gave up and went down to dinner. 
After dinner my friends went for a night cap - the hotel seemed to be fully booked but the main bar downstairs was closed - they went back up to the upper lobby where there was no seating available - eventually they got served and just brought their drink (gin and tonic with no lemon or lime ' 'the saddest looking drink' they had ever seen) back to the room and continued the chat there as there was no point waiting for a seat - needless to say no second drink was bought as the trek back up to the lobby did not merit it !",3,2016,04,19
218,So disappointed!,"Wife and myself booked this hotel for our 
wedding anniversary. The web page for the hotel looks stunning but all is not as it seems. We booked a two night stay, Sunday and Monday night. We were offered 2 breakfasts and one evening meal at 400 euros for a junior suite. The reservation was made by telephone and at the time I asked for a confirmation email as the price I was quoted was slightly less than advertised on line. 2 days later no email so I emailed there customer line. 4 days no reply. Emailed again stating if no-one replied to my email then please cancel the booking. Very soon after that I got an email apologising and offering me an upgrade to their full suite. ( ie bridal suite)
On arrival the suite looked amazing however 
point 1. web page states ALL ROOMS HAVE JACUZZI BATHS. Their full suite did not.  
Point 2. The room and especially the bathroom could be used by butchers to hang meat. Only one radiator in the bathroom which had a larger dresser directly in front stopping any heat escaping. 
Point 3. At about 18:30 I asked reception why it was so cold? They said heating was on a timer and it would come on soon. It did an hour or so later however must have went off very soon after as on both nights I felt like I was camping with Scott and his party on an Arctic expedition.
Point 4. Asked for and extra quilt as it was so cold. House keeping arrived with a hairy blanket that looked and smelt like it had been used to cover a grand national winner in the early 70's. Staff had told us earlier that other rooms were vacant so when we asked for a quilt from those rooms we were told we couldn't have an extra quilt.
Point 5 pillows in rooms are harder than Vinnie Jones. Again staff told us that all pillows were the same so couldn't offer us anything else.
Point 6. Night one.. as we so were tired from driving 150 miles to get to Fawlty towers, sorry killashee we decided to have our included evening meal in the restaurant. Be aware the main restaurant is not open on Sunday and Monday night. We were sat in the only working BAR for our meal. Meal is a choice of 4 starters 4 mains 4 desserts , if you want a different choice from the main menu then it will all cost you. NB Fish is 17.50 euro, burger is 16.50 euro we could have the fish at no extra charge but the burger is 7 euro extra. No logic there then!

Man united and Spurs were playing that night and lucky us we were sat between 2 large screen TVs playing the same game at full volume. We were sat in a table between the thorough fare for the smokers and those checking in and out. So it was great to have smoke waft past us every time someone fancied a fag, and watching suitcases and their owners pass by whilst I ate my chips. Incindently the bar meals are mediocre at best.  
None of these restrictions are mentioned on the web site. 
After leaving Sid's cafe we asked at reception for an ice bucket. Staff very accommodating said they would send one up. I'm still waiting for that bucket!
Night 2 point 7
We were packed and wondering wether to just Jack it in and leave when I took the 3 hour donkey trek to Sid's and asked the bar man for an ice bucket...see photo attached. I can't believe the crud that was floating at the bottom of that vessel the morning after. How I wasn't sick.....
Point 8 room keeping 
Each day dirty glasses left and not cleared, two TVs lucky us but ONE remote between the two tellies. 
Point 9 BE AWARE.
The hydrotherapy pool with the saunas and jacuzzis etc looks lovely on the web page doesn't it, but if you really look you'll see in small print.. It's 20 EURO EACH FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. The pictures shown lead you to believe it's all included. The only free pool is a separate 25 metre laned pool. 

40 euros each day simple maths an extra 80 euro for the use of the spa for 2 x one and a half hour sessions. LOVELY. 
Oh and the spa is in a different building which is 100 yards or so across the main car park. From our room it was down a corridor, from level 3 to level one in the lift down a set of outdoor steps and across the car park. Not mentioned on the web site.

Spoke with manager there and she did offer us another stay by way of an apology but as I said if they can't get it right on a Sunday night when it is quiet and in their best suite when could they get it right? They did however knock 50% off the bill but to be honest this equated to about £170. The only saving grace was a decent breakfast but that wasn't worth that kind of money. 
It sounds like moaning for moaning's sake however we have stayed in hotels around the world and I have never yet had to put a review on here. Look if you wish but this is my first ever review I have written and I have to warn others this is a disaster of a hotel. It's grubby in places and the pictures have obviously been airbrushed. Avoid it ..... Never again.....",1,2016,04,19
218,"Returning guests, standards have NOT slipped.","We recently stayed at the Killashee just outside Naas. Being return guests we knew what to expect. As with our previous stays we found all the staff be friendly, professional and efficient. Nothing was too much to ask. We had dinner and breakfast and as always the food quality was excellent, it’s great to see it hasn’t slipped over the years. 
Our suite was fabulous, it was very airy with plenty of space. Housekeeping did miss a glass of wine left by the previous guest which was surprising. 
I would still recommend the Killashee as a great hotel for a break away or a spa break. I’ve stayed many times and I can still see myself returning again.",4,2016,04,17
218,Afternoon Tea,"Have just returned from a very disappointing 'Afternoon Tea' with a friend in Killashee House.   We were brought to a table and a waitress wheeled over a trolley and offered us a choice of different varieties of tea.   After selecting our choice, she took a teapot from trolley, emptied used tea leaves into a container, spooned in fresh tea and filled pot with water from flask on trolley.  Teapot was not rinsed or heated. Result, lukewarm tea.   I then had to ask for a clean cup as there were tea stain rings in cup in front of me.   The baked ham, emmental cheese and chutney on onion bread was prepacked ham, processed sliced cheddar and a dot of chutney on white bread.   There was no taste of lemon off the egg mayonnaise sandwich as per menu.
The worst part of this experience was when my friend lifted a piece of bannoffi with a fork and a hair came with it.   When we brought this to the attention of the waitress, she apologised and removed offending cake and cake stand which was not even half empty with lightning speed from table.  On her return she offered us a glass of sparkly each!   As this was a 50 euro Mother's Day gift voucher treat, I asked for a refund which I eventually got.   Needless to say ,but we will not be back.",1,2016,04,17
218,A lovely hotel,"We really enjoyed a night away with our 4 year old. The hotel is very family friendly and the staff on reception are very welcoming and helpful. We ate in the bistro which was relaxing and tasty, though more expensive than average. There is a lovely lounge upstairs which was perfect, our daughter could play away while we relaxed. We used the pool which is lovely though we found it a bit cold. The girl on reception in the leisure club wasn't very friendly. No smile and looked at me like I had two heads because I said 'good morning'! Overall a lovely experience and I will happily recommend it to my friends 😊",4,2016,04,17
218,Conference visit,"good hotel, albeit a bit large. 
but the rooms are comfortable and the service is very freindly.

during the conference i was positive about breakfast, but a bit disappointed about lunch and dinner. 

You can go for a run around on the soccer field and for a guinnes in the snug attached to the hotel.",4,2016,04,12
218,A Wonderfull Weekend,I visited this hotel for a family occasion. The reception staff were very friendly speedy and efficient. Check-in took no time at all .The hotel is very large and very popular It obliviously caters for many functions and  several were going on whilst we were there.  The function I attended was in beautiful settings and in its own private area. There was plenty of staff to attend to our function. The rooms are generous in size and are well equipped . I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel,5,2016,04,12
218,Mothers & daughters,"Came here for the spa experience girly night away
Disappointed firstly on arrival when checking in - gave our details to be told that there was no booking with my name- the phone rang & the receptionist picked it & carried on a conversation re a booking & left us standing there😫
Room big spacious but cold! 😰
Spa centre outside a good walk around the hotel to the back through car park & it's now spilling rain - wasn't told re short cut through rear of hotel!
Spa - hydrotherapy pool had 4 young male employees enjoying the fun😌surely these lads could have used the other swimming pool during spa appointment times 😫 steam room v good but the cold shower comprised of a garden hose attached to a fitting outside the shower itself - when u turned it on you could have been power washed with the strength of flow through the nozzle attached😂 spa treatments basic with my daughters exfoliant still on her face after her facial😢
Food in bistro nice presentation but cold as was the soup on arrival!! We sat here to have few drinks & chat but we had to leave as we were frozen. This place needs updating v badly  & you should be supplied with sat nav to get to your room 😂
All n all v disappointing experience 😢",2,2016,04,11
218,Wished we hadn't bothered,"We went to killashee hotel with another family for the night. There was a wedding on which we had not been informed about on booking so I asked for a quiet room - I was told the wedding party was totally separate in a different wing. We had a very poor meal as it appeared the pressure was on staff due to the wedding. When we went to bed we spent the night listening to the wedding disco and then the revellers making their way very loudly to their rooms on our corridor- shouting, banging on doors and singing... It was like an endless procession.
In short this is a wedding hotel & if you are not st the wedding you'd be much better off staying at home. ",1,2016,04,05
218,Ideal for kids,"My husband myself and our 3 young boys stayed here for a night during the Easter holidays. The staff were very friendly and helpful and they had great provisions for the kids as it was during the holidays. We missed the afternoon kids club but they had a cinema night where the kids were able to chill were given snacks, ice creams (hubby got one too) and we were able to relax in the large upstairs foyer right beside the cinema room. Kids also enjoyed the beautiful grounds and the swimming pool. Food was above average but hospitality was second to none. ",4,2016,04,04
218,Amazing hotel for an amazing wedding ,"We have just celebrated the wedding of our daughter Arlene to Paddy at the Killashee house hotel. 
The hotel is superb, one of those that has unique character and decor. You could easily get lost in its maze of different ways to get to different section of the hotel - yes it's quite a big hotel.
The staff at the hotel were superb- it's not that they were constantly checking if everything was ok, it was that they seemed to always appear when you want them - real professionalism!!
Tom Boyd managed the main event (thank you Tom and all of the team) which went great - it was a well oiled machine - and it was so relaxed. Tom made us feel really special. He didn't actually leave the hotel until hours after he was finished as he looked after the party until the very end,  well into the next day at the residents bar - what a very late night!!
The food was the best I've eaten at any wedding and piping hot. Service was excellent and not rushed in any way. The only dodgy part of the day was my speech. 

We ate in the bistro bar the next day again service and food was top class. Breakfast was great too

Just to finish up - don't hesitate to book this hotel it's an amazing place for a mini break, I can't believe it would disappoint. ",5,2016,04,03
218,Wedding,"We stayed here as part of a wedding party.
Our room was lovely, spotlessly clean. The ensuite was lovely, nice and big compared to alot of hotels. The room had teamaking facilities, slippers and robes were supplied. 
The hotel was old world style and nicely decorated, very much in keeping with its history which personally I loved.
The wedding room itself was lovely and spacious, nicely decorated. Service was good and the food was beautiful. 
Breakfast was served from 7 to 11 which again was great as most hotels start at 8 and finish at 10 which leads to overcrowding. The food was good and loads of it. Sadly no Danish pastries😯
The staff were all very pleasant and friendly.
There were only 2 little negatives
1. The front bar had only 1 barman serving at lunchtime and he struggled to cope with the wedding party who were gathering for the ceremony.
2. The corridor to our room was nothing short of a 5km walk (joking) but could be hard for someone who has physical restrictions. 
Tips:
1. Make sure to mention the need for a room nearer to the reception rooms etc if someone in your party has physical problems.
2. Shop around for room prices, I was quoted 160€ b&b on booking.com for a double room, €145 by the hotel (wedding rate) and I booked the room Alpharooms for 118€ b&b.

",4,2016,04,02
218,OK meal for a 5star price,"Had an evening meal with friends. Great venue and fantastic surroundings. The price paid for the food was what you would expect to pay for high quality dining - not michelin star level, but certainly interesting flavours and textures well cooked. Sadly the food was merely average - not horrible, and nothing wrong with the quality of the base ingredients. But preparation and combination of flavours just, well, mundane!",3,2016,04,01
218,Disappointed!,"Spent a few days here for my wife's birthday. From the website it looked like a lovely hotel but unfortunately it did not meet the expectations we thought it would. The hotel is outdated and needs refurbishing. The room we stayed in was spacious but not modern. We ate in the restaurant the first night but we were disappointed with the meal. The breakfast buffet was nice and plentiful . The hotel bar is very nice and the bar food was decent the nights we ate there. The hotel was lacking in cleanliness both in the bedroom and especially the dining room where we discovered some dead flies on the window which was disappointing to see. There was also beer glasses left sitting on tables in the upstairs lounge and outside for the three days we were there, which gave the impression that standards where not being met or overseen by management. The grounds surrounding the hotel were very nice but again needed some attention in places as it looked neglected. Overall we were very disappointed with the standard of the hotel and felt it lacked some character, which doesn't match the standards advertised on the hotel website.",3,2016,04,01
218,Wedding,"Top hotel, we attended a wedding, the hotel was excellent, staff were very accommodating and the food was top class.

Overall it was an excellent stay, happy to recommend.

The hotel had a lot of character, just filling gaps now because trip advisor need 200 characters",4,2016,04,01
218,It was just ok,"Went on monday for lunch, had fish and chips, not great had to wait a lot for our food. The only thing I would like to mention is the french lady that served us on monday, she is great. Very nice service and she is the best there! Actually I wouldn't write a review, I just wanted to mention how good she was, sorry I didn't ask her name.",3,2016,03,30
218,Not worth the money!,"Went to Killashee for a spa 1/2 day.  Treatments were fine.  Out of 4 treatments 2 were good and 2 were just about average.  The place seemed to be lacking in staff and we were not sure at times what to do or where to go and this affected the whole experience.  Afterwards we went for lunch to the hotel bar.  We choose from the lunch menu and wished we hadn't bothered!!  Lovely setting, place needs a bit of loving care and you will pay to come here over the odds!!",3,2016,03,29
218,Beautiful hotel,"I have just returned from my first family hotel visit, and I can say I will be returning with my family next Easter.

The staff are warm and welcoming and nothing was a bother.

The entertainment for kids was great e.g. Kids club, cinema night, play room and kids meals with dessert.

The grounds are beautiful and my kids enjoyed the intimate fairy garden. 

The space in the hotel is great. Upstairs lounge area was great to keep kids amused colouring whilst adults enjoyed a quiet beverage.

The only thing was the swimming pool, gym and spa is in a separate building so bring an umbrella or car to avoid getting wet on those rainy days. Staff at reception will happily provide an umbrella. 

I will be recommending this hotel to my family and friends and cannot wait until I return. ",4,2016,03,29
218,Very disappointing stay,"My partner and I arrived at the Killashee Hotel for a one-night break away package including an evening meal in the bistro. The room was described as 'superior' but there was little superior about it, it would correspond to a classic double in any other hotel. The furniture was old and dated, pillows very thin, and I woke up cold twice during the night. The hotel itself, and two lifts needed to get from room to reception, was quite annoying also - it is as another person said, a maze of corridors. 
The pool and spa were lovely - however paying an additional 40euro for entrance to the spa hydrotherapy pool area was a bit steep - value for money it was not.
But the real low point was the food and complete lack of training of the majority of bar/service staff. Our menu was limited, and we were not on a groupon or any deal so I don't see why we were limited to four options for each course. The starters were fine, my main course of hake was missing half the elements stated on the menu, and no staff member checked us so I had to wait a long time to get the matter rectified - basically I was almost finished my meal by the time the sauce and veg accompaniment arrived. My partner's Irish coffee was the real low point - it arrived in a large latte glass, no sugar and very little whiskey. He asked whether it had sugar in it and was told that the Irish coffee had been made in the kitchen!! Then the waitress brought it to the barman, who stirred in a sugar, instead of making a fresh coffee. We asked for the bill, and nothing was said about the long wait between main course and dessert/coffee nor the awful coffee; I waited 30 minutes for the awful ice-cream and sorbert (all mixed up in a tall glass that a child would love) and melting into each other. Breakfast was poor the next morning - I am as always, baffled that a 'chef' cannot put together an omelette - having asked for no spring onion in it, the omelette came garnished with chives!!! It was so bland and unappealing. 
And to top it all off, knowing that we had not been happy with the meal the previous evening, as my partner had spoken to the receptionist and then the bar manager afterwards and complained, still we were not asked how we had enjoyed our stay. 
Irish hotels are really in need of a shake up, this kind of crap sevice and lack of care is not acceptable. We had a rare night away, without our child which was supposed to be a treat, but was the usual substandard service and staff without knowledge - not having out booking in the bistro to begin with, serving Irish coffee with milk and sugar, not knowing what should be on a dinner plate, and not knowing whether goats cheese is pasteurised. Not good enough.",2,2016,03,29
218,Superb!,"Myself and 5 friends went to stay at this hotel for the Easter Weekend as the Blessington Broadway Challenge was on. 

Firsty, 

There was AMPLE car parking! A big plus given a lot of hotels these days squeeze you into a tiny underground facility.

The building itself was beautiful. I was told it used to be an old Boarding School and this was confirmed when you see the vintage school photos in the lobby. Really nice to see it keeping its heritage and character.

The Reception was gorgeous. The receptionist was very helpful as I had many questions and seeking for directions to the Blessington Broadway Challenge function room. I didnt manage to get her name, but job well done to her.

The room was elegant - King size bed with a cream Ottoman Bench at the end of the bed. The telly was wonderfully hidden away into a wooden cabinet - so it didnt take the focus of the room. MAGNIFICENT! The room was clean and quiet and tucked away on the second floor but not too far. The halls were spacious with windows also, no usual dark cramped hotel hallways here! The bed was comfortable and the sheets were super soft. We did get a disabled room, so the shower was fixed on the wall. At the highest point it reached my chest - max. that was sort of annoying but the hotel was busy so we didn't ask for a new room.

After our Shenanigans in the Blessington Broadway Challenge my group and I wanted food - and the local fast food outlets were well closed at 3.30 - 4am. So we ordered room service. In steps the guy on reception - Andrew. I can't speak highly enough of Andrew. He was great craic on the phone as we ordered food and delivered it so fast! At that time we could only order a ciabatta, a wrap and toasties at that time. but they were out of ciabatta bread and wraps so we got toasties! and Andrew was so apologetic that he gave us free Hunky Dories (We requested them earlier off another member of staff and we were told they were sold out in the hotel - which is understandable) Andrew got the Hunky Dories from the Staff vending machine for us as a surprise. I know this isn't standard procedure but he really went above and beyond for my Boyfriend and I. After we ate the feast he delivered, I rang reception to say thanks and that we really appreciated him - but he was gone home.

Employee of the Month - for sure.

Will stay again!

218,Beautiful Residence but service is lacking,"Spent two nights here recently for my mam's birthday. The location is fantastic, so close to Dublin and Kildare has so much to offer. The house is beautiful and the grounds are really well maintained. The receptionist who checked us in was friendly and welcoming and first impressions were great. We had booked in for afternoon tea that day and found the whole experience so charming, the young girl who served us was fantastic and really attentive. Our room was average but did the job, I wouldn't believe the website too much, most of the hotel is really tastefully decorated but it does lack in some places, our room was really off the beaten track but signage was generally good throughout. 

We went for a drink in the bar the first night and had a lovely chat with who appeared to be the restaurant manager. One suggestion would be a drinks list on the tables or details of any cocktails on special, I only noticed the notice board behind the bar on my way out. We returned to the bar the following evening for food and were left disappointed by the experience. The menu for guests of the hotel was bare and not well balanced. I ordered crab cakes from the a la carte and was wholly disappointed by the two little patties that came out. Trying to get the attention of the waitresses was very difficult as they actively avoided eye contact, no one came over to check how we were getting on and any time we tried to order we felt the staff were bored and didn't want to serve. I feel they really let down the restaurant manager who was doing a great job. While the staff did not know this, my family have been involved in hotel and restaurant management both in Ireland and abroad for over 40 years and I spent almost ten years working behind the bar and on the restaurant floor. The cheapest thing an establishment can invest in is good service as one review speaks to many. When we went down to the spa that evening to enquire  about the spa the lady on reception had her coat on and made it clear she was ready to leave and didn't want to speak to us, even though it was still early in the evening? 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here, the location is great and the hotel is so charismatic but service needs a major overhaul",4,2016,03,29
218,Mixed bag,"The room i had was spacious enough and not missing anything but was a bit tired and could do with some tlc. The public area were decent and clean. Being a converted country house the main bulding and grounds were really nice. Unfortunately as i was there mid week the main restaurant was closed so I ate in the Bistro. I had the worst steak i've had in a long time. The first one was over-cooked and very chewy, the second one allthough cooked well was also really poor quality meat. My colleague also said the same about his steak. The pepper sauce was more like low grade gravy with no pepper in it. The staff however were friendly.
I had high expectations which were let down, it's very doubtfull that i'd return",3,2016,03,27
218,Fantastic Easter break.,"There isn't anything I can say negative about our stay at kilashee Hotel. 
Loving every minute of it!! 

My room is amazing in the old house and close to the restaurants and bar. 
Afternoon tea served in the conservatory that looks out on to the garden as does my bedroom view. It's a picture postcard and breath taking.😀😀😀

Staff are all amazing especially Tom that helped with our bags. A very pleasant young man and was courteous and front of house he is excellent at his job. 😀😀😀

Naomi on reception that checked us help with all our needs and nothing couldn't be handle with a smile! Very professional young lady. 😀😀

The Manager Annetta was on top of her game. She handle a very busy restaurant Jacks, with her fab floor staff! Managed to seat us with elegant poise. 😀😀😀

Turners restaurant is white linen cloth table setting in a beautiful Victorian room. Blown away with the service, Louise took great care of us and help my young ten year old daughter to choose her meal. 😀😀

The Spa is very well run like clockwork, Sharon the manager knows the game or organisation and looking after to everyone with their specialise areas of need from face to body!😀😀
 Emma my therapist a beautiful girl and I' have been around the world visit my share of beauty Spas and in comparison she knew her stuff!! 
The gym is well equipped and plenty of free weights and treadmills for every one!! 😀

I'm coming back for the May bank holiday weekend! So looking forward to it!! 😀😀😀",5,2016,03,27
218,Girly spa day ,"Myself and my friend attended the Spa at Killashee for the day to enjoy the tranquil treat packages. Omg what an amazing offer! I have been to so many spas and this is by far my favourite one! The interior is so luxurious and expensive looking. My therapist was a lovely girl named Caroline, every treatment she done was done to perfection. I highly recommend her. The relaxation rooms are so peaceful and therapeutic. Also if you are going for a spa day you HAVE TO use the flotation beds. Heaven on earth. My only negative comment was the lady at the hotel reception was quite rude telling us where the spa is and the spa is very segregated from the main hotel. It was lashing rain and she told us to walk to the spa. We were drenched. Everything else was fabulous. Caroline is a credit to the spa. ",5,2016,03,26
218,Wedding,"We recently got married in Killashee. In the run up to the wedding no question was too big or too small for the wedding planners we were dealing with, Katie and Aoife. All e-mails were replied to very promptly and everything was very clear. Killashee really  know how to run a wedding, from start to finish. They really take the stress out of having to organise things. Katie had been helping us for over a year and was so professional and efficient. 
Rooms
The rooms in Kilashee are all very spacious. We stayed for two nights, the bridal suite on the first night and a different suite on the second night and both were lovely. Guest rooms are also very spacious and well equipped. We got a champagne breakfast (standard for the bride and groom) on the morning after the wedding in the room which was lovely as we had eaten then before we chatted to guests at breakfast.  Killashee were very organised and kept us updated regarding booking of wedding rooms etc. Anytime we e-mailed we would have a full list back within the day and everything was very clear. It’s a busy hotel and I’d advise guests attending wedding to book in early. 
Drinks reception rooms
One of the reasons we choose Killashee was the very large drinks reception room. It has loads of couches for everyone, which we wanted after we had travelled for over an hour. If there is not a second wedding on, there are also other stunning drinks reception rooms to choose form in the old house. It was great having everyone together and everyone can see each other.  The full bar in the drinks reception room is very efficient. 
Food
Food was amazing. It was just gorgeous and again here the hotel  were very accommodating with any changes we wanted to make.  The tasting evening was also very enjoyable. We chose to stay over and the hotel upgraded us to a suite for the night. All of the staff were so friendly that night and really made us feel at home.  The mulled wine at the drinks reception was also very popular. 
 Reception room
The reception room was beautifully appointed and elegant. We got a backdrop and uplighters from Finesse Weddings who are also the in house florists at Killashee. The centrepieces they supply are lovely, you wouldn’t even need to consider others. However, if you did want something else Mary at Finesse weddings has a large selection and she’s extremely helpful.   The Christmas decorations around the hotel and reception room in general were very nice, not over the top and fit well into the hotel’s décor.  It was great that there was no need to move tables and the dancing could start whenever we wanted.
We didn’t leave the hotel all weekend but I felt like I had. We had dinner in the Jack Lynch bar the next day and then we went to the snug bar for finger food. We had the snug bar to ourselves and it was lovely. We had a band play music there for a few hours. We also Killashee at the last second to set up a projector screen and it was no trouble, it was done in two minutes.  They also gave us extra food at two times throughout the night, this was very much appreciated by everyone. Killashee have loads of options for days after weddings and will help in any way they can. 
Finally, the banqueting manager Andrew. He was just amazing on the wedding day, so helpful at all times. He kept us informed about everything and was fantastic at keeping things running smoothly.  I can’t speak highly enough of him or Katie and everything they did for us.
I couldn’t recommend Killashee and their staff enough. Thanks for everything.",5,2016,03,24
218,Our Favorite Place,"We were married here in 2009, and have returned many times since to stay the weekend as couple or family or with friends, or just for lunch or dinner. Could never fault the service we received at any point. Looking forward to many more visits in the future.",5,2016,03,22
218,Truly wonderful experience for the whole family!,"Had an absolutely amazing weekend at the hotel .....experienced unbelievable service: efficient, friendly staff who all appeared eager to offer a great guest experience. Our boys aged 8 and 12 loved their stay too and all staff we encountered were great with the kids. We bought a package deal for our stay and found great value in accommodation and food - the food choices catered for our kids likes and dislikes and the food we ate was superb! Swimming pool was fantastic as well as entertainment for kids and spa experience for hubbie apparently also fab! Would definitely come back for another visit!!",2,2016,03,22
218,Relaxing Night Away,We recently stayed in Killashee house for one night. There was a wedding on while we were there but we wound't have even noticed. The hotel is well-kept and our room was lovely and spacious. We ate in the bar twice and the food was lovely. Breakfast was well organised and there was a huge selection of food to choose from. All in all and enjoyable stay.,4,2016,03,22
218,Fleeting trip but lasting memories ,"We stayed at Killashee for one night. It was our first trip away after having our baby so we were really looking forward to our stay and it didn't disappoint. I had requested a room with a bath and upon our arrival we were automatically given an upgrade to a superior room as all standard rooms with baths were unavailable. The room we stayed in was called the Bell Tower. It was a lovely room but the large bathroom with freestanding bath elevated it to another level. 
We had booked for a 5 course meal in the restaurant that evening. The staff were so hospitable and the meal was wonderful. The following morning we had breakfast in bed which was delicious and arrived within the time frame we had ordered it. All in all a hotel with old world charm but modern facilities and first class hospitality. Needless to say we will be returning for another stay. ",5,2016,03,20
218,Family Break,"We went here for family mid-term break last autumn. We had a room with 2 doubles and one camp bed, which fitted our family of 2 adults and 3 kids fine. The hotel is a bit of a maze to get around and the corridors reminded me of The Shining but our kids seemed to enjoy that vibe! The pool is lovely, although it is a bit of a trek across a car park to get to it. The breakfast was very good and the grounds are really beautiful. One thing other reviewers have touched on and I would have to agree with, is the problem with trying to get food in the bar. On the first evening we arrived at 6p.m and were told it was booked out even though only 2 tables were occupied. I asked if we could have a table there and then and vacate by 7 and this was no problem, but I didn't see why the waiter didn't suggest this in the first place instead of trying to send us away. The food was nice but service was a bit cold. We had dinner in the dining room the following evening and booked it in advance. It took us 2 and a half hours in total to have a 3 course meal, and with 3 kids in tow this was very stressful due to the long wait in between courses. In general, we did enjoy our stay and it was a lovely family break but these small issues and some friendlier staff would have made me give this a higher rating. Very convenient for the National Stud which is a great day out for the kids.",3,2016,03,20
218,Fantastic Stay,We booked the hotel last minute following the Irish Rugby match. The staff were fantastic as always. Beautiful surroundings and great food in an excellent location. Definitely recommend the hotel to anyone and look forward to a longer break in the future.,5,2016,03,20
218,"""Perfect Location"" close to Kildare outlet shopping, friendly and helpful staff","Location was excellent to kildare outlet shopping village, ""Turners"" restaurant menu choice was fine however my son and I had fish dishes both were very salty. My husband had the steak with a 10euro extra suppliment (which I think is overpriced)  The staff were excellent very friendly and helpful. Our Room 334 was fine, perhaps a little tired, the original house is so beautiful, and what I expect, however the add on buildings do not do any justice to the original at all what a pity.",4,2016,03,19
218,Excellent!,"Location, accommodation, cleanliness, food, staff.... All excellent. I stayed here for one night, only wish that I was there longer to enjoy the spa facilities and beautiful gardens. To be honest, I could not find any faults!",5,2016,03,18
218,Spa break and overnight stay ,"Beautiful hotel with a fantastic spa, the rooms are beautiful with fantastic beds and pillows. The food was very tasty and atmosphere and service very good. The reception area had lovely hidden snugs to relax ---Id imagine it would be perfect for families to sit back together and chat the night away as if in their own homes. :)
",5,2016,03,17
218,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to our stay here, as on the website the rooms looked incredible. However, I was quite disappointed. Our room was quite dark, and certainly didn't look like any that we had seen online. The decor of the hotel was a bit tacky, and Ii didn't feel in keeping with the beautiful exterior of the place. A modern bar off reception with coloured LED took away from any old style feel of the hotel. The staff on the bar seemed very relaxed and slow, and many tables were left the whole night without being cleared. 
We did use the leisure facilities which were fine, and the breakfast the next morning was lovely. Overall, I did feel that it was overpriced for a very average hotel.",2,2016,03,16
218,Lovely surroundings but poorly operated,"We stayed here for one night last weekend. The hotel itself is lovely, huge buildings, high ceilings, really high quality finish throughout. The property overall, including the gardens and surroundings are worth of a fifth star. Staff were exceptionally friendly, all facilities and rooms were immaculately maintained, and they cater without difficulty for everyone from 9 months to 90 years old.

Wi-Fi - an absolute essential these days - was lighting fast. Good selection of TV and room service, etc. 

Unfortunately, organisation within lets the business down. The downstairs bar was closed to facilitate live music upstairs where there was not enough seating for everyone. Reception was crowded and table service not forthcoming. The duty manager facilitated us as best he could, but this wasn't really good enough.

The food was mediocre. Steak lacked any flavour and orders were confused. Breafast tasted re-heated, although the selection was extremely wide and plentiful.

A sandwich was not available in the main bar at lunchtime. 

All little things which took from the huge potential this place has. With a plethora of reasonably small changes, and some small touch ups here and there with the paintbrush, there is no doubt this could be a future 5 star hotel.

I would probably stay again, mainly because the price is per room rather than PPS and all things considered for 2 or more people this offers very good value, all things considered.",3,2016,03,08
218,"Not amazing, its a Maze!","We found getting to our room very confusing, it was like a maze going up and down lifts, stairs, corridors. The corridors had a slightly damp smell. The room was nice and comfortable apart from the howling noise the toilet made after each flush which we reported. The staff were all very friendly especially in the restaurant and thanks to Amy for a lovely spa treatment. We did want to go for a walk around the woodland trails but only found only a short 10 min. walk including the nuns cemetery and a view of two rusty old CIE train carriages. We asked at reception thinking we might have missed it but they were unsure and said that was it. On checking out the next day, the other receptionist said there were several but that was very disappointing at that stage. We had read on the website that the hotel had ""acres of splendid gardens and gloriously wild woodland and trails, there are so many hidden places to explore"". Unfortunately we couldn't find them despite asking. We found the sign posting very poor. Getting to the spa from the hotel through the maze and a back exit, across a car park was a surprise. We weren't the only ones that found the layout of the hotel and gardens confusing.   The food in the restaurant was very nice and good service.  There was a wedding on the Friday night and some traditional music on Saturday which we could hear from our room. Overall the spa and facilities were excellent and the staff were very friendly throughout our visit. If some improvements were made to the sign posting inside and out and the plumbing was fixed it would help.  I don't mean to be negative and I hope these comments are used in a constructive way.",3,2016,03,08
218,Reasonable and rustic,"Stayed here for a long weekend with my wife as a belated birthday treat for her.
We arrived at the hotel late at night and the driveway was very welcoming, lit up and leading up to the hotel.
It appears like a large country mansion and has history as a school/ convent (not sure which, or both!)
You get a sense of the history as you approach, there is a quaint snug bar facing the car park, then a seemingly empty dark building with old desks and things through the windows, before you approach the main hotel.
The entrance is inviting and in our whole stay there was a fire burning in reception, very welcoming and the smell of an open fire always gives me a feeling of home!
We checked in with a friendly staff member and were told where our rooms were.
We were in the belling wing and finding the room was a bit strange.
We had to go up in the lift, pass through a derelict bar and down a few corridors, past conference rooms.
We then had to take another lift down a floor and onto our landing.
It was so deserted and quiet it reminded me of the shining - I was half expecting to see two little girls holding hands round each corner! :)
Our room was very spacious and I loved the old fashioned style, yet modern build of the bathroom.
The room was very clean and keeping up with the rustic yet modern feel, the flat screen TV was hidden in an old style tv cabinet. The DVD player was also a nice touch, I usually bring my laptop for this so it was nice to get full use of the tele.
On our stay we had breakfast delivered to the room and although the breakfast was pretty standard, it was nice to sit at the rooms table.
On each day of our stay we wandered around the gardens of the hotel and uncovered a nuns graveyard, a fairy garden and a derelict train yard!
The gardens were lovely but I couldn't help but feel it's full potential is reached in summer time.
There was a wedding while we were there and I could see why they used this venue.
Finally the staff.
We had little dealings with the staff but any we had was professional and courteous, even in passing a young member of staff asked my heavily pregnant wife if she wanted him to carry her bags, the little things can mean a lot.
We had a really nice stay here, very relaxing, next time I would make better use of the gym/ spa.
The gym spa is across the forecourt in another building but if you can make sense of the lift system there is a door from the hotel facing the spa, cuts down a big walk round.

218,Overnight Catch up with Friends,"A few of us booked this hotel for a night way to catch up and we were all very impressed with the place. The reception staff were very nice and both check In and Check out was effortless. The drive up to the hotel was lovely and then the old buildings come into sight and it makes you excited to be staying there!..Lovely grouns surrounding the hotel which You could walk around and a woodland area with little fairy doors on the trees(i will return for a family stay). The interior of the hotel is also very nice and I thought in keeping with the old theme of hotel. Lovely areas to sit , relax and have coffee. The rooms were very spacious I had a twin with a friend and we had two big double beds in the room so was quite nice and it had all the facilities you would expect. We had booked a package with a dinner included in the Bistro. The food was excellent and a lovely atmosphere here, again the staff were very friendly and the place was very busy. The whole hotel was very busy which was great to see. After dinner we went up stairs where there is another bar and lounge area and there was two guys playing music who were very good and the atmosphere was great. Breakfast next morning was excellent we had the Eggs Benedict which was really nice and there was lots of fresh fruit, cheese, ham and lovely pastries, a very good spread. We were at breakfast for 9.15 and it was fine but on leaving at 10AM it was very busy and a small wait for tables so would advise an early breakfast!  I used the leisure facilities which were nice and very clean the only little downfall is you have to leave the main hotel and walk a short distance to pool( not a problem at all on this visit but if I had my toddler with me we often wrap him in towel and bring him back to room to bath and dress him so would not be possible in this hotel). As it is an old building for some rooms you have to go up in lift and then take another lift down to get to room so a little different but as I said its an old building so it has to be accommodated. We all enjoyed our stay here and I will definitely be back , definitely one of the best four stars I have stayed in and a bit nicer   than some average five stars at least you get excellent value for money here. Can t wait to return :)",5,2016,03,07
218,lovely hotel,We were at a wedding there last week On arrival we went for our room it was a bit of a treck up lifts down lifts to our room worth the wait as the room was above average nice size. The staff at the wedding seemed to be all young irish students they worked well together as the meal flowed without any hitches.Would recommend this hotel for a nice midweek or weekend break The pool and gym area is a good size.Overall our experience at the hotel was excellent.,5,2016,03,06
218,Nothing like the website!! Not worth the money!,"Dont get me wrong, it's a good hotel but sells itself and is in the price bracket of a Druids Glen. This ain't no Druids glen.

Website is deceiving, feel a little cheated.
Although rooms are lovely, great ensuite. Free wifi. Tea/coffee, dressing gowns.

Here for a weekend break. (Dirty weekend 😎)

Beautiful grounds and old hotel tastefully restored.
Arrived to a bustling reception.
The music from a wedding was so loud I couldn't hear a word the receptionist was saying.

Pleasant and professional on the desk.
Had to get 2 lifts to our room.
Opened with a pint and club sandwich in the bar. Sandwich €13 but was tasty,
Guinness only €4.80.
Chips so chunky I could have assaulted someone with them!

So for a swim.....
Huge gym, very busy. Pool ok, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. Bit shabby, could do with a refurbishment.

Had dinner in bar. 
Crab cakes - criminally boring no flavour.
Rib eye was tasty.
My wife had the gnocchi for mains, tasted like paper, they didn't charge her for this so well done.

Went for a drink after dinner. Nice bar downstairs but that closed at 10:00!!! and we were moved to a upstairs gallery with music.

Ok, the gallery was my grandmas living room. The worst seating arrangements I've ever seen. No bar stools. A sea of uncomfortable unsocial sofas.
My 4 star rating is now a 3 star.
Not only that, the only route to the rooms is through this bar so someone please slap the owner. Lounge boys walking past you with trolleys of glasses.

Breakfast is served till 11:00. Proper time to eat! Good breakfast. Good service.

Booked the hydrotherapy.
No lights in steam room, sat in the dark.
Hot/cold showers didn't work. Pool pleasant enough.
Would have complained but nobody there!

Evening meal in turners restaurant.
Great starter of crab meat but the rest a disappointment.
Wine very overly priced.

Despite everything had a good weekend but I won't be returning.

Ps: if any staff reading, the shower is blocked in room 229. Forgot to tell reception.",3,2016,03,05
218,Wonderful Food,"I attended the National Training Awards in Kilashee Hotel on Friday 26th February 2016, and would particularly like to thank the chef and team for the most amazing, gorgeous, good meal I have had in a very long time. It was 'simple' in the sense of the produce - which was obviously top class - being straightforward but it really was something very special. Everything was cooked, presented and served to perfection, and it really was stand-out in terms of 'texture' and flavour. Thank you also to the staff serving the meal, they were very efficient, approachable, pleasant and helpful, thank you.",5,2016,03,02
218,Shees big,Huge hotel.impressive from outside.bar area very nice.dinner was great quality and breakfast was as good as ive had.good produce well cooked.beds very good and room spacious.swimming pool is great size.i recommend hotel particularly if you are shopping at kildare village outlet.theres a discount for residence. Room 303 18.2.16,4,2016,02,29
218,"Lovely hotel, beautiful grounds ","Killashee is a gorgeous location, the hotel is lovely and feels like a complete getaway as you drive up the driveway! 
There was a wedding on so it was quite busy but lots of parking around the back!
Dinner was excellent, although the mains came 5 minutes after the starter, which felt quite rushed!
We were in room 336 which is lovely, but quite dark! 
The fire alarm going off twice in the night was worrying, reception told us it was guests, smoking which set it off! 
Breakfast to the room, lovely! 
",4,2016,02,28
218,Christmas present,"Myself and my husband stayed here for a midweek break, I had booked it for him as a Christmas present. We had never stayed here before and given previous reviews read on here, we were a little apprehensive about what to expect. 
However, we enjoyed every moment of our stay. Yes, the hotel is dated in parts and it is a bit of a walk to bedrooms, but I think other reviews are unnecessarily harsh on these points. If you take the time to appreciate the fact the bedrooms are at the back of the old house and are clearly an extension to the house, then you can understand why there is a bit of a walk. It is fair to say that you get to see parts of the hotel you wouldn't otherwise if you take the stairs rather than the lift too. As well as that, they have put consideration into decorating the rooms to suit the overall appeal of this hotel.

On arrival we had been told we had been upgraded to a suite and were delighted with the size of the room, as well as the ensuite and amenities. 
I have never been in a warmer hotel! The room was so warm as were other parts of the hotel, which was brilliant given the cold February weather.

It's fair to say some staff might need to brush up on their skills, but those few were far outweighed by the capable and pleasant staff we encountered. They were very helpful and happy to help where they could. 

We ate in the restaurant in both nights and loved all our food. Service was swift and any staff we spoke to were eager and chatty. Overall it was a very nice, relaxed atmosphere. We also took our drinks to the foyer and say at the fire on the second night, which was really nice. 

The wifi in the hotel was fantastic, a huge bonus in my book. Never had any issue with it in the room, restaurant or foyer. 

We walked round the gardens a couple of times and they were lovely. We did go as far as the nuns' graveyard which is way at the bottom of the gardens and were disappointed at how the paths hadn't been maintained right the way down. However, the majority of the grounds are lovely and a definite must.

I also booked into the spa during my stay and while I had to leave the hotel building to use it, the staff and experience at it more than made up for this. I really enjoyed the treatment and relaxation room and was only sorry I didn't take more advantage of the facilities before my treatment. 

Breakfast on both mornings was very nice, buffet breakfast with lots of choice of cereals, Danish pastries as well as the usual fry. 

Other bonuses for us included the DVD player in the bedroom and bottles of water left on the table. 

This is the first review I have left on trip advisor but wanted to give as helpful a review as I could to others thinking of staying here. I believe some people go searching for problems in hotels, especially ones which are older and not trying to compete with modern, city hotels. All my expectations were met here, for a relaxed, warm and friendly environment. There were also business conferences taking place while we were staying, but not once did we feel imposed or bothered by anyone. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel and would have no problem returning.",4,2016,02,26
218,Birthday celebration ,"Ten of us between sister in laws..mother in law and nieces & friends we attended the Spa on a Saturday afternoon. 
We all had a fabulous time and it was so relaxing. All of us had our treatments and we were all made feel very special. Between us all we had facials, back head and neck massage..pedicures..dry flotations..etc. the staff are so amazing and we chilled out in the relaxation area and also we had the hydrotherapy pool. Refreshments and fruit juices were beautiful and refreshing after our treatments.  Looking forward to visiting soon.",5,2016,02,25
218,fantastic stay,stayed here for a function and was an absolutely perfect spot to stay. staff were all friendly. breakfast one of the best I have had in any hotel.The rooms are well set and beds very comfortable.The outdoor surroundings and scenic views were great. highly recommended for anybody,5,2016,02,24
218,Business Trip,"Stayed here on a business trip hotel clean and tidy and catered for most needs.  Breakfast was nice, never ate dinner in restaurant though decided to head into Naas instead.  Reason I am giving 3 stars is I felt some of the staff in bar and receptionists that I liaised with when booking could have been a bit friendlier. Also seemed a bit disjointed to get to room up a lift down a lift then a bit of a walk",3,2016,02,23
218,Great Stay,"Stayed here recently as I was attending a function. I must say we were very im,pressed at the hotel particularly the food and surroundings. It is very clean and well run.

What particularly impressed me was the security. While at the function there were some security men who I witnessed dealing very well with some patrons who had a few too many drinks and became a bit unruly in close proximity to us. 2 of the security men dealt with the situation well and even asked us later were we ok and did we feel comfortable. This really is a credit to the hotel, taking patrons safety seriously. Well done.
We had a great night and enjoyed our food.
Well done all.

218,"Not at all ""Perfect""","We had booked three nights stay at this hotel but checked out after one night. Very disappointed as website looked very inviting.  We had two Junior Suites, one had faulty heating so room very cold on arrival. My room had mould all round the shower so I wouldn't use it, pillows were thin hard foam, mattress rock hard, telephone in room fell to bits, towels like sandpaper, food not good, asked for a glass of champagne and served flat prosecco. Rooms were very tired, overlooked a car park. Breakfast satisfactory. We complained but didn't receive any deduction on our bill and we then moved to The K Club which was fabulous in every way.",2,2016,02,21
218,A little boring. There are better hotels at cheaper prices in Kildare,"Stayed here for one night in February 2016. Enjoyed the night away but have been to better hotels in Kildare, and at cheaper prices. The outside of the hotel and its grounds are beautiful but inside could do with a major renovation. The bar is somewhat modern but the rooms and surrounding areas are outdated, boring and a little dull. The hotel is a vintage-like theme but the bar does not correspond well to this. 
Check-in was quick which I really liked. 
The choice on the menu for lunch and dinner in the Bistro is the exact same except when eating dinner some dishes were removed and the dinner menu became half the lunch menu. Very disappointing. The waitress also told us what the dish of the day was but said they were running low on it which put some pressure on us when ordering our food, as aforementioned, there wasn't a great selection anyway. 
Room was ok, a little cold and again, could probably do with being re-decorated. An average hotel but will not be running back anytime soon.",3,2016,02,20
218,Bar needs an upgrade,"Had a drink in the bar recently with my husband. Difficult to find a comfortable seat as most of the sitting is for dining except for a couple of sofas which were occupied.
Ordered a  glass of Pinot Grigio which really was not nice. Neither the wine nor the glass was chilled. On complaining the barman very kindly gave me a fresh glass from the back of the fridge but this wasn't much better, so presume the fridge either wasn't turned on or it wasn't set at the correct temperature. Disappointed that a hotel of this calibre can't get a simple glass of wine right.",3,2016,02,17
218,"""Seminar""","Stayed here last weekend on a work seminar and I have to say I would love to go back for a relaxing break. (Unfortunately I will have to watch out for a deal on it as it is expensive)
I had the most fantastic room, very spacious and comfortable. The food was of a very high standard throughout the weekend and I enjoyed every meal.
The seminar ran so well, and the meeting rooms were very comfortable. The staff were all friendly and especially on the Saturday night at dinner.
I did not get any time to visit the spa or leisure center but will definitely do so if I return. The only thing I could say on the minus side is that the heat in the conference rooms was way too high. This seemed to be a problem throughout the weekend.",5,2016,02,16
218,Brilliant weekend.,"Great venue for our school reunion.
Good ambience, delicious gourmet food catered to all tastes and requests.
We didn't know how busy, the hotel as we were allowed quiet area in dining room on a Saturday night.
Big thanks to Joe Hendrick and staff. Nice attention to detail.

218,One night stay,"We went for a one night stay and my wife was booked in for a 3 hour pampering session which she would highly recommend and indeed said she would love to go back again.

The hotel and the grounds are excellent and the staff are amazing. The evening meal was lovely as was the breakfast the next morning and we would certainly return.",5,2016,02,14
218,Telaxing,"Stayed with my two daughters and we had a lovely time, rooms were clean ,fresh & spacious and the breakfast was delicious .We really enjoyed our treatments at the spa , we will be back.We went into Naas village which is a 10 minute drive .Its also close to Kildare shopping village ,thanks to all the staff who where very helpful .😄😄😄",4,2016,02,12
218,Excellent service and Venue Amazing,"We go married here October 2014 and It was amazing, the venue the staff. I really can not compliment them enough.  And every one of our guest has said how nice the rooms were and more importantly just how amazing the service was. Being honest, I can be a nightmare as a guest in visits to past hotels. However I genuinely did not have a single thing to complain about. We will certainly be revisiting many times i am sure. 
I must recommend the Bar food also and the beer choice. 10/10 for me.",5,2016,02,11
218,Really dissapointed,I had for years built up this hotel at home as i had attended on Numerous occasions for business....eventually had a Hotels.com voucher and decided to stay there last Saturday night with my Wife..... I was delighted to book a large room with 2 double beds so a good nights sleep guaranteed...paid in advance so no hidden surprises.........got to check in at 3.15 to be told rooms were not ready so we went to the bar and had some lunch eventually checking in at approx 4.30 did the charity walk to the room via 2 lifts to find ourselves in a room with one bed......i rang down to be told we had been upgraded ??? no robes /no glasses/ no jacuzzi don't know what we were upgraded from as there was  nothing special about this room other than when we were in here they could give the bigger room to one of the many family's at the hotel......don't have an issue with that but don't tell me after i complained about the room that i had an upgrade....you surprise someone with an upgrade on check in.... to find they had supplied a complimentary bottle of water but no glasses....had to go to the gallery Bar for Glasses as room cleaners told me they had none......... that was all fine no disaster as of yet until we went down at 7.15 for dinner when we were told the restaurant was fully booked and they could seat us after nine.......we decided on bar food.....to be told all the tables in the Bar were pre-booked ??? and they could seat us after 9pm.........we decided to wait for the bar food sitting with a drink in reception in front of  beautiful open fire.....during the wait i popped in to Bar and restaurant to see ample empty seats ........very disappointing as my wife cannot see what all my fuss was about and would not go there again to wait 2 hours for bar food....when we sat down and ordered they brought us the wrong starters so we ate about 9.45...shambolic policy of keeping reserved tables when no-one sitting in them ...they should release say 30 minutes after reserved time...............only saving grace was that when we eventually got the food it was lovely and breakfast the following morning was excellent........ would we be back on leisure trip....probably not,2,2016,02,09
218,Very nice,"Huge hotel, really comfortable food. Leisure centre is lovely and amazing grounds for walks. Food very nice too, overall pleasant stay! Lots of parties and weddings on while we were there (Halloween weekend)",4,2016,02,08
218,Service with a scowl,"Unfriendly staff coupled with a complete lack of any kind of soundproofing in the room made for a very unenjoyable stay, especially considering the price we paid. Would not recommend to friends and family.",1,2016,02,08
218,One night get away,"We recently spent the night in Killashee for a relations birthday, its a lovely hotel. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food in the bar was lovely and a very well priced ribeye.
You can get lost in the corridors very easily though.
The breakfast was a buffet, with loads of staff running around. I thought a nice touch for a hotel like this would have been to be a semi buffet. So hot food ordered at the table but cold meats, cereals and breads are buffet. Just a suggestion.
Overall I like the hotel and would stay again.",4,2016,02,08
218,Lovely relaxing stay at Killashee,"Stayed with my husband as a birthday treat for him (and also a treat for myself) on a Thursday night on our way to visit family in Carlow. Found everything very welcoming and comfortable with the hotel. Stayed and ate in the Bistro, where the food was really good although would have preferred more mushy peas! We were a bit disappointed the snug bar wasn't open and didn't realise this until we went looking for it. 
We had a hot stone massage booked for the following day and it was a bit of a mission to get to the spa from our room and to go outside (don't forget your room card to get back in) we throughly enjoyed the massage and would recommend guests to go to the spa, lovely hydropool (at extra cost) and relaxation room. The staff in the spa were really friendly and the hot stone massage was amazing and we both felt really relaxed and chilled out.
The only not so good thing was the morning cooked breakfast buffet was really dried out, this may have been the time we came to breakfast at 08:30 to 09:00 but there were options for freshly cooked food, I was sorry I didn't take this option. The soda bread was amazing and I had seconds of that! 
Reception were friendly and when asked if I could have a late check out was offered and extra hour which suited our times due to the spa treatment and we were also given a VIP pass for the local Kildare village outlet shopping.

Over all we really enjoyed our stay and would come back but spend more time to enjoy what looked like amazing gardens and walks.",5,2016,02,07
218,Great hotel for getting lost in,Stayed in this hotel with my family and on arrival was welcolmed by the staff who were vet helpful.the hotel itself is huge and after what seemed like a huge hike I arrived at my family room which was huge.there were 2 huge beds and a large seating area and the bathroom was well appointed. The decor was dated with the tv being a old type one housed in a tv cabinet.the only disappointement was having to walk out of the building to visit the leisure facilities and Tyne the long walk back again with wet hair and tired children.the spa was amazing and had great deals and as the main restaurant was closed we eat in the bar which was more than adequate for us and the children's portions were great.,4,2016,02,04
218,Very disappointing ,"Myself & my husband stayed overnight on Saturday for a business event that was taking place at the hotel. We had previously stayed in this hotel for a friends wedding 3 years ago and the standard between the two visits was quite significant. Our room was very cold to start with. We had dinner which made me ill. We also ordered 2 beers which we had to wait over 30 minutes to receive only to be given a warm beer. Later in the night we tried to order a basic sandwich from room service. After 20 minutes of trying to call with no one answering the phone my husband called the hotel directly on their main number explained we were guests in the hotel & could reach no one to order a sandwich to our room. No explanation was offered as to why this happened. 45 minutes later a server knocked on our door to ask for €25 for 2 basic sandwiches. €25!! Needless to say we did not have the sandwiches. The following morning we tried to have a shower. After playing around with it for 20 minutes we then realised the only way to get hot water in the shower was to keep the shower running while turning on the hot tap in the sink, other than that it was cold shower. Breakfast is your basic buffet. Catered for the masses. Definitely won't be returning which is unfortunate as we actually enjoyed a pleasant stay when attended our friends wedding. ",1,2016,01,31
218,Fantastic Stay,"I stayed here for 1 night for a work function. I have been before to the hotel and was always impressed with almost everything about it.

Firstly the hotel itself is beautiful to say the least. Very grand and stylish. The snug bar with live traditional irish flok music set the tone for a great evening. The pints of Guinness were top quality as we all know its hard to find a decent pint these days. The rooms were clean and spacious with an ambient temperature.

The staff. It's always important to come face to face with pleasant staff in a hotel. The receptionist that checked me into my room was about as welcoming as a grizzly bear eating its lunch. I'd like to take this opportunity to apologise for interrupting her from her chat and let her know that next time I promise to automatically know the etiquette she expects from all of the guests. I never let this experience ruin my stay. I'd like to point out that a particular member of staff completely redeemed things on behalf of the staff during dinner. A girl called Maddie who was exactly what I expect from such a brilliant hotel. Despite being rushed off her feet, she was always smiling and patient towards around 80 guests. She stood head and shoulders above everyone else because she looked like she enjoyed her job whilst many others we clearly feeling the heat. People at my table complained that they had asked for trivial things like gravy or pepper from other members of staff and they are yet to appear, however this wasn't the case with Maddie. 

The food. The food was a very high standard in my view. Well cooked and well presented, with brilliant flavour. Breakfast is also excellent and has something for everyone.

Overall, I loved my stay and will definitely return with my wife for a spa break, and will encourage others to do the same.",5,2016,01,26
218,Beautiful Hotel needs some refurbishing !!!,"Visited this hotel for 2 night stay with family , 12 in total. Our room was OK clean and spacious had everything you would need but would need a little facelift.! Hotel very large and  there was 12 people in 4 groups, we were all over the place  rooms 123 rooms 315  etc. Does no one look at this when we do a group  booking? 
Many good things and some not so good, 
Food good/ service poor
Staff nice/ had to keep asking for things like tea coffee at breakfast etc
Ordered dinner arrived 50 mins later
Ordered 3 ice creams took 20 mins to arrive
One of the rooms dirty and am member  of family complained and was immediately upgraded with no fuss and an apology to an amazing room, but why was original room allocated in first place? 
Bed we had was hard and pillows worse.
Sounds not great but we did have a good weekend as food was great breakfast really good and dining room very spacious ( but you have to make your own toast) !!
Staff nice but not over friendly.
Hotel absolutely beautiful as I said but needs updating.walked around function rooms and would say they are the nicest I have seen anywhere.!
So overall a mixed review. Some good some not great.",3,2016,01,25
218,Not too Impressed,"Stayed one night with my husband on last Saturday. Their Snug bar was not open and we were not informed of this before our stay. The Bistro bar was the only bar where a couple could then choose to go but it was over run with families with small children, not very relaxing for a couples night away without the kids. Of course you could leave and head for the town but then you're talking about paying for a taxi which we had not planned on leaving the hotel at all. There was not even a bottle of water in the room?? This is supposed to be a four star hotel?? When I phoned to mention about the bar at reception they told me the upstairs bar is open. I told the duty manager that it wasn't open as I had come through that area to go to my room. Hence she said they would open it, 10 mins later we go to the bar, bar tender is just setting up I ask for a wine only to be told there are no cold drinks. we go back to our room and take out of own drink have not been left with much choice. That night and the next morning we were told the snug bar was probably booked for a function, a function with no people I guess because that bar never opened that night at all. 250 rooms all booked out and not a single area open to cater for adults. The grounds of this hotel are beautiful  I enjoyed them more than the inside, which is sad to say plus it is not cheap to stay there. I am bitterly disappointed by the whole experience, We wouldn't go back if it was given to us for free.",3,2016,01,25
218,Excellent venue for a celebration,"We had my wife's birthday lunch in The Bistro in the Killahsee hotel at the weekend.

We had a private room which was perfect for small children. The day was a great success, the food and service was excellent.  Most of all everyone enjoyed themselves!",5,2016,01,19
218,"Good potential, poor execution","I spent a night in Killashee Spa last weekend. Myself and my partner booked the stay and dine in Turners package through Killashee's website. However upon arrival I was informed I had in fact booked an over 55s stay and dine in the Bistro, after presentation of my confirmation email the receptionist concluded I had in fact booked the Turner's package and the issue was on their end. We headed to our room under the illusion that we would receive a confirmation phone call with respect to our booking in Turners and our request for a fridge, we received no call. Then at dinner to my embarrassment one of the waiters informed me I was on the bistro package and would need to provide additional payment, after I showed him my confirmation email indicating my package this was cleared up. Finally upon checkout I was informed that I had purchased a meal in the Bistro and would need to settle this payment, thankfully the receptionist dealt with this quickly when I informed her I had no such meal.
I would like to point out that the hotel itself, all the staff I encountered and the spa facilities were excellent. It seems that the computer systems were at fault here and it is a shame because the hotel has potential to be a top quality resort with its ideal location, beautiful grounds and enchanting setting.",2,2016,01,17
218,Business function ,"Spent two nights here, excellent venue for a corporate function with great facilities. 
Bedrooms are warm and spotless with good wifi. Function food was excellent and tasty. Main bar was very well managed with good bar food, would opt for this over turners Restraunt. 
Ample parking with excellent leisure complex. ",4,2016,01,16
218,So called Tranquil Spa Treat ,"I attended the Killashee Spa recently for the Tranquil Treat as part of a family birthday gift. To my disappointment the day was very unsatisfactory. We struggled to get towels and robes and when they were provided they were extremely damp. The reception staff were less than helpful and it was clearly written all over their face.  The treatments did not go for the time that was stated on the brochure and in fact some treatments were not received.

On top of it all the rooms were cold and when requested to turn the heating up in their so called relaxation room a small foot heater was brought into the large room!

Unfortunately a day that I looked forward to was a huge disappointment and let down.

218,Great stay,"I really enjoyed my recent stay at the Killashee hotel. I was visiting friends over the festive season and it was the perfect accompaniment. 

The hotel is very well appointed. The staff were very professional and the food and beverage options excellent. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in and around Naas. 

I will return again soon.",5,2016,01,11
218,Great Family Hotel,"Very rare I write a review about a hotel but was so happy with our stay in here over the Christmas I decided to. We also stayed here in August for two nights and had a great experience. This time we stayed Dec 29-31st. Wife and two year old daughter. 2 nights b and b and one evening meal really great value. Amazing gym facilities and 25m pool. Staff super friendly and great place for kids. Its a four star hotel but the food is 5 star quality. Best breakfast we've had in a long time. Fresh fruit and you can order whatever breakfast you. I understand what the previous person said about the weddings there but we really didn't notice them. 
If you want value, good food and service this hotel ticks all the boxes.",5,2016,01,10
218,Fine hotel,I have been here a few times - it's good but the bedroom I had the last time was a bit tired - some rooms have net curtains though mine didn't.

218,A disappointment,We booked a night away on the 29 th of december with dinner and b and b .We arrived there was a wedding no big deal .We got our room 207 and we were very disappointed with it . The furniture is all damaged and scraped the grout in the shower is all discoloured and dirty looking .I taught the hotel was run down the lift system is crazy there is architrave hanging off and the Medite is all chipped also hallways were dirty with tray out of rooms left at the end of the hall this was 8 o clock at night. I was woken up at 3.30 by a lad roaring and shouting for ten minutes I rang reception but wad told it was the wedding party .I don't mind paying for a hotel and have been at wedding and know the crack but this is a 4.3 star hotel not €80 it's tribe that I expected better I won't be going back . Food was good wedding taking there tole on this place. Ken hall,2,2016,01,03
218,Last minute stop off ,"Stayed here at short notice Recently , surprised as other reviewers not kind at all to this lovely hotel. Setting is beautiful , very busy with wedding & a busy bar which really is a restaurant rather than a bar. Both dinner & breakfast very tasty , service was prompt apart from forgetting a drink ! Would stay again but will request a room in main house as had to get 2 lifts to room. Room very nice & spotless

218,"Visit  ""Vie de Chateaux"" or ""Trax""  instead. ","Keywords: Tacky, Overpriced, Poor Service, Mediocre Food. 

To whom it may concern,

This is the second time our party have been wholeheartedly dissatisfied by this restaurant & venue.

My father made a definite reservation at the Turner Restaurant over a month in advance.

When we arrived we were abruptly told the restaurant was closed and were directed to the bistro bar, having travelled for over 40 minutes.

We were not notified of this change. No missed called or messages/emails.

Noted during service:

One of our party has an allergy to pepper.  Pepper present in starter. Members of our group had to swap plates.

Had to ask 3 times for the wine menu. 

Microwaved rice. Hard & Inedible. 

""Rainbow fish"" - My father ordered Sea Bass and was served a Sea trout in place. Called a ""Rainbow fish"" by staff. We jokingly made light of this, yet it was not funny.

Yellow mayonnaise: ramekin on table when we sat down. Had been there for hours. Disgusting.

Lipstick on glasses. Plural.

Poor service skills, bar & service staff were obviously under pressure and had inadequate training to deal from the influx of restaurant bookings. 

MANY customers with same problems. 

10% discount when paying. Didn't have to ask. Manager knew service was poor and disappointing.

Made what should have been a special night on New Years Day into poor overpriced bar food.

Will never return.

Regards.

218,Definition of hospitality,"As a world traveler I have experienced the best and worst in service and accommodations. Killashee is certainly in the top five hotels, in my 40+ years of travel.
Each and everyone one of the staff made you feel welcome and that they were there for you no matter what we needed especially Bistro staff went above and beyond our expectations.  Every single member of staff I encountered was very friendly and polite. A special mention to Simone though who served us throughout dinner and who was a delight the whole time. (Thank you for replacing my knocked over dessert!!!) There were no restrictions on the choice of courses at dinner, the chowder starter was the nicest I've ever had and my steak main course was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The full Irish breakfast the following morning was fantastic. 

I can't think of how the stay could have been any better. A huge thank you to everyone concerned for making our stay absolutely brilliant, the hotel and staff are a credit to the hospitality industry. I will be definitely coming back.",5,2016,01,01
218,One night stay over Christmas,"Was a little disappointed with our stay in this hotel. We booked in for one night this Tuesday (between Christmas and New Years). When we arrived our hotel room was not ready for an hour despite us arriving after the check in time. All spa treatments were booked out so we paid for the hydrotherapy pool but it was so busy we were advised to use the gym changing rooms rather than the spa changing rooms. We had to hang around an hour later again to get a table in the bar for some bar food that evening and were overcharged for our meal, however the staff were helpful when they realized. A bit disappointing for the price you pay.",2,2015,12,31
218,Really disappointing :(,"The hotel building is impressive, the service and food is not.  We met some friends for a meal in the bar and overall, the meal was a very disappointing experience. In summary; Bar food manager ignored us on arrival. Waitress, though very busy prepared a table. Waitress very poor knowledge of the dishes on the menu....Seafood trout ??..€17.50... small piece of steamed fish on a dubious seafood mash accompanied by two carrot skins and warm limp rocket as the vegetable.  Duck breast (one) on mashed potato with one spoonful of red cabbage.....€26.....outrageous.  Poor service and menu choice and no one interested if we were happy or not. Will not be rushing back or recommending.",1,2015,12,31
218,Superior customer servics,"Would just like to acknowledge this hotel for superior customer service. I booked a night away for my wife and I and received a free upgrade to a superior room without asking. Unfortunately we had to cancel at short notice due to our daughter being unwell. I rang the hotel to advise them, and being aware of the cancellation policy, I had no expectation of not being charged, but was hoping to perhaps get a credit note to visit another time. The hotel very kindly agreed, and again without me asking, to cancel the reservation with no charge. Really appreciate these gestures of goodwill, thanks you. We look forward to visiting your hotel in the future. ",5,2015,12,30
218,Fabulous hotel,"Had a mini break in July - 2 nights with 2 sons, had a lovely time - food, rooms, staff and facilities were fantastic

218,no longer special,"this is just an update on my last review.  I came here 2 days ago with my mother.  We used to be huge fans and have been disappointed on ever visit in the last 6 years.  Yet like fools we keep trying.  The service was ok, I went to the bar and found a waitress, gave her my order yet she said she had to come to my table to take it, so I returned and 10 minutes later she arrived to take the order I had already given her.  What??? are you daft ??? She did not notice the Iorny of this.  2 drinks was 17 euro.  When I wanted to pay I had to try to get her attention as her and the hostess were in deep conversation.  
I have not forgiven Kilashee for closing the nuns kitchen, however its a new owner now and I was informed that they have opened a new bar, different from this Jacks bar and its very nice.  
I couldn't find it but reception advised me that it only opens Friday and Saturday's.  OMG no matter how hard I try I cant give this place the love I once had for it.  

Crap service, expensive drinks, loud when its busy today was not.  and a bar that only opens 2 days a week, what next.  Bring back the old Killashee House Hotel, it was much better. So good that we have held 2 family weddings there and spent weekends there several times in the past. 

The pool is part of a gym and the spa is located there also its a walk across the car park and not a short one and if the weather is bad as often is here in Ireland this is not nice especially if you are going to the spa in preparation for a wedding. 

Not in the future though I feel. Im not a fan anymore",3,2015,12,28
218,Luxurious hotel & spa situated in beautiful landscaped gardens ,"Difficult to get to without a car, it is located some 2km from the town of Naas, 30km from Dublin. Naas is served by a free bus service from the nearby Sallins train station which has regular trains to/from Dublin (Hueston station). A taxi from Naas to the Killishee costs around €8.

The hotel itself is in a large rambling building (or series of buildings). The rooms and onsite bathrooms are huge & luxurious with a King (or Super King) sized bed (extremely comfortable), large screen TV, tea/ coffee making facilities and guest slippers.

The staff were friendly and efficient . The lounge/ bar are restaurant are all comfortable with great service. The breakfast was good with an large choices from traditional Irish to continental breakfast. The decor throughout the hotel is eclectic - seeming to consist of several different styles but somehow it works! I didn't get a chance to try the pool or spa on this visit.",4,2015,12,26
218,Just beautiful,"We stayed one night at this beautiful hotel, loved the old-world charm, beautifully appointed interiors, over-seized rooms, and the sense of splendor it evokes.  Gorgeous landscaped gardens, and views across the Irish countryside.  Incredibly good breakfast buffet - loved it!  They played this Barbara Streisand CD in the dining room and personally I didn't think it created the right atmosphere - light classical would have created a far better ambience.  Nonetheless, beautiful dining room, white table linen, views on the gardens, good start to the morning.  Note to the kitchen: don't use the same pots for tea and coffee.  Tea drinkers can definitely taste if tea is made in coffee pots!!",5,2015,12,21
218,"Gorgeous old world charm, class and sophistication","Recently stayed here for a quick two nights on a business trip to Ireland, and fell in love with the place. The hotel itself has an immense pedigree and history, reflected in the obvious opulence and quiet class all throughout the hotel, both in the physical decor and atmosphere.

It is a bit more difficult to write a comprehensive review when the stay is short and the time spent in the hotel is also limited due to activities, but I'll give my standard points. I realise there are some negative reviews, so do your research rather than just rely on my review.

Check in was easy and the staff were friendly and helpful, accommodating a colleague who needed an adaptor, and myself who needed a dental kit. No complaints here.

The room was gorgeous, and nicely oversized for what we had paid - albeit this was a corporate rate. Plush, comfortable and the bed was great - I slept like the dead, which is unusual for me in hotels. Shower was good, with a good sized bathroom, as I recall.

The location is horrible if you want to be in Dublin, but if you're aiming for a bit of a country weekend away in a gorgeous part of Ireland, which isn't all that far from Dublin (45 minutes or so) but still has access to some bigger towns and villages (including Naas), then the location is fantastic.

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here, and only regret not being around longer to enjoy more of the hotel. As I say, it was a short visit, so take my review with a pinch of salt perhaps, but I really enjoyed being here and would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,12,16
218,Very poor service,"A group of us stayed at this hotel during a shopping trip to Kildare and Dublin. The
hotel is beautiful but unfortunately the service is extremely poor. Last orders for dinner is 9:30 PM. We ordered at 9:15 PM and we were served cold starters and cold main courses. We made a complaint to the waitress on that evening and she explained to us that the chef was gone home so she heated our dinner in the microwave and was very apologetic because of this. There was just one person working in the bar and we had to wait 25 minutes for a drink. The next morning when checking out I explained to the person in reception that we had an unpleasant experience at dinner the previous evening. He told us we should have made a complaint the evening before and I had to explain to him that the manager the evening before had no interest as he was present while we were eating our dinner and was aware there was an issue with our meal but did not approach us. We were extremely disappointed with our stay .We definitely would not recommend this hotel.",1,2015,12,07
218,Standards have slipped,"Felt compelled to leave a review after attending a wedding recently. First off, the Guinness in both the main bar and reception was the worst I've ever ever had. I person working in main bar and wedding bar which meant service was so slow. Stayed two nights and had lunch on Saturday, really slow service again. Not served for 30minutes and that was only to take order. Very disappointed",1,2015,12,02
218,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed at Killashee in October (Half term) Big Mistake, we stayed here several years ago, its very different now, on check in the rooms were not ready ( we had two), so we waited, my three daughters were sharing, they got their room, and in fairness to the receptionist she was lovely and sent up two glasses of Prosecco, Thank you. The second room was ready approx 4.45pm  and the receptionist brought the keys up to my daughters room (very kind). Breakfast the following morning, children running around opening the big silver platters with hot food in them. No Parents saying anything to them, and Yes I have three children, at 11.15 pm that night I had to ring reception several children Screaming up and down the Corridor.
We went over to the Gym and spa and the hydra pool, its brilliant. the girls over there on reception, (gym and spa) need a gold medal, WHY Management Team, have you the gym and spa desk together????? I do not need some body builder, beside me, while I am trying to speak to the Spa Staff on personal treatments, lovely hotel.",4,2015,12,01
218,"Good, but some flaws","Great location, nice room and good bed. Some issues that point to some 3 star behaviour.

First the toilet was broken when we arrived, plus the shower rail came off its hinges.

Evening meal - great steak, but my seared Tuna starter was both bland and tiny.

Breakfast Eggs Benedict was woefully overcooked.

Seems like midweek is given over to Corporate events. Maybe the weekend would be better.

Overall, good value for the price, but some failings in delivering four stars.",3,2015,11,26
218,Delightful,"Recently stay here as we where attending a wedding and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel itself and the surroundings are magnificents. The staff were very friendly and the food was okay. Hotel room was quiet with a lovely big bed.There was plenty of choice for breakfast. 

Would be glad to attend another wedding there.",4,2015,11,22
218,Just Stunning,"I stayed here for one night as part of business trip, my only disappointment was that it could not have been longer. Stunning hotel in a beautiful setting. Entrance to the hotel in the reception area is very grand and beautiful.

Service was excellent all round from the reception staff to bar and waiting staff. Food in the restaurant was excellent, myself and my two collegaues who I was staying with all ordered something different and all 3 of us had a fantastic meal.

Room was very old style with 2 queen size beds, antique style furniture and was a very generous size. Could not find the TV in the first instance but then discovered it was hidden away in what I thought was a wardrobe but was in fact a TV cabinet!!!

I did not get to use the spa facilities as unforntunatley due to traffic we arrived later than expected but if I was to ever go back to this hotel for leisure, I would definitley make use of them.

I would stay at this hotel again for business or pleasure.",5,2015,11,22
218,One night stay,"I booked here as I was visiting ireland for a horse sale and this was near that location.. I booked online with only a very small deposit and arrived late in the evening.. The service from start to finish was fantastic despite the hotel being busy.. My room was in one of the wings and was a great size with double twin beds, separate sofa and writing area.. The bathroom was a good size with every thing required.. I ate in the bar, the food was well cooked and well priced.. Check out was simple and straightforward and the price for my stay was not expensive.. Would I stay again yes for sure, would I recommend yes definitely..",5,2015,11,19
218,Top class ,"We stayed here recently in a Sunday night to just have a getaway and Killashee did not fail. 

We found then reception staff very friendly from check in to check out. The bistro was nice area to dine in which a nice menu available. The staff were friendly though out the bistro area.

The main restaurant wasn't open as it was a fun day night but we did have breakfast the following morning there and it was to die for.

Thank you for such a relaxing night away and will most certainly be back again soon. ",5,2015,11,18
218,Business trip,"I have stayed twice at this hotel for business trips, the last time for three nights and found the staff pleasant and attentive. and the rooms are fitted to a very good standard. Service and quality of food in the Bistro was good on a all three nights, and the staff were very pleasant and helpful - will definitely stay again.",5,2015,11,16
218,Excellent Hotel 5*,"Stayed here 14/11/2015 for a wedding, staff fantastic/food simply exquisite and as the the rooms just delightful. I would recommend any body visiting Ireland to stay here. The only thing was the road works on the main road, took you on a detour to the M7 when leaving the hotel. Overall this hotel is one of the best I have stayed in. Many thanks.",5,2015,11,15
218,Excellent hotel and spa with great facilities and service,"Stayed here for a conference and made full use of the excellent leisure centre, which has a 25 metre pool and 1st class gym.

Service was excellent throughout our conference, the room was large and well lit.  Food very nice indeed, especially the evening meal.

Located just outside Naas in private grounds, this is a great hotel for a romantic break as much as it is for a business venue.  It is very large, so ask for rooms close to the centre of the building if that's what you prefer or close to the leisure centre if that suit you better.

The staff were lovely, the food excellent, the facilities first class and value just right.  Will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,11,13
218,Wedding guest,"Stayed here attending a wedding. Decent value for money for accommodation. Very spacious room with good fast wifi. Beautiful pre drinks area in the old original house. This theme runs through the entire hotel. Very vintage feel about the hotel. Excellent service for the wedding banquet. Really can't fault the place apart from the fact that the bedrooms are a bit of a trek from the reception area, but the walk did me no harm! Very good 4star hotel.",4,2015,11,11
218,Very nice hotel and superb value for money,"Ive rated this hotel relative to its cost (sub €100/night incl breakfast).
Lovely looking building with wonderful seating/bar area.
Room was large, 2 double beds, small table etc.
You can see that there have been some lively nights (stained carpet, glue(?) on the desk) and some of the furniture also shows wear. Bathroom tiles around the shower need attention.
Quite convoluted to get to some rooms but all corridors beautifully maintained.
Would I stay again, yes definately, I would love to have time to try the spa.",5,2015,11,11
218,Excelent,"It was a very good surprise on the way to Dublin after a long drive,nice room with comfortable bed and nice view over the gardens,got Turnes restaurant package for dinner but we change for bistro as it was nice atmosphere ,very good food and  deserts top range  excellent service and have to  mention about  Italian Manager very attentive  and make us feeling  very welcome,all it was a pleasant stay,thank you guys 
ps.Try Eton mess dessert ",5,2015,11,09
218,Our wedding,"Myself and my husband celebrated our wedding here on the 18th of September... from our initial meeting with the hotel to the weekend of our wedding we can not speak highly enough of the hotels performance. We were thoroughly spoiled by hotel staff throughout the whole experience. All staff were very friendly and professional throughout the weekend under the guidance of the excellent banqueting manager. The wedding co ordinators went over and beyond to meet all out requirements. All our guests were extremely complimentary about the high quality food and service they received. We could not recommend this hotel enough, it is the perfect location to celebrate your big day. ",5,2015,11,05
218,Birthday Disappointment,"I booked the hotel bar for a birthday dinner with my hubby. We've a new baby and I had organised a babysitter, so you can imagine our excitement. 
We were shown to our table by our server. 
The xfactor was on the big TV and to be honest the staff including the manager were more interested in watching the results than providing a welcoming environment or showing any interest in their customers. I doubt any order of service was followed. 
There was no interaction between staff and customer, other than taking the order and dropping the food. 
Our food was good quality but the staff had no interest in their customers. We waited ages for our drinks, I noted that the pint of heninkens had the head replaced several times on one occasion by the barman.
Our special night was not made special at all. 
On my trip to the bathroom, I noted some excellent spa deals. On my way back I asked the receptionist for a brochure, I was told there was none available and her head shot back down to her computer. 
Again no interest, I felt she could have taken my details, and either emailed it to me or even given me the spa number so I could have called. Great opportunity to upsell lost.
",2,2015,11,02
218,Very nice hotel,Stayed two nights with my husband and two kids ages 8 and 13. Staff very nice. Hotel really good and our room was lovely. Ate in The Bistro for lunch and in the restaurant for dinner. Food excellent. Swimming pool great. Only downside for me was having to go outside to get to it.  Be nice if there was a link from Hotel. Overall a good experience. Kids entertainment in the evening came with dinner if required. Girls were lovely there very accommodating. We would go back.  Olive,5,2015,11,01
218,On appearance - good but everything else - not.,"After reading the positive reviews I booked a 2 night stay in a family room. First impressions were great. Beautiful looking hotel and as equally lovely inside. Once checked in the receptionist gave us directions to the room- simple. Not really! It is on a split level so we ended up having to take 2 different lifts. Not too much of a problem.
We entered our room- lovely, clean and plenty of room but the heat was unbearable. Radiators were turned off and window opened as fully as it could go (small slit).

We then went to find the pool with our 3 year old. The spa is not actually attached to the hotel and you need to go outside to a separate building. Changing rooms good and pool looking ok. There were white plastic tables and chairs to sit on at the poolside, not great. The children's pool was definitely on the cool side so we did not stay for long. Disappointing.

At around 6.15 we decided to go to the bistro for dinner. We were told it was fully booked until 9. However when checking in we were not told about this. We asked reception for directions to a child friendly restaurant, the receptionist found it difficult to think of anywhere and then told us of another hotel which would 'probably fit us in'. We ended up ordering room service which was fine.

Breakfast was fine the next morning. Before leaving for the day we decided to book a table at the bistro. The receptionist wrote our reservation down on the back of a last sheet of paper which was attached to a clip board. Would our reservation make it to the bistro? No. Thankfully the bistro was not fully booked when we arrived for our table. Service was very slow. Not good with a hungry 3 year old. We had nearly finished our main course when our bottle of wine arrived.

The next morning we were sat behind a pillar for breakfast. Our 3 year old decided to go round the pillar to sit next to his dad. Unfortunately this was at the same time a male senior member of staff was walking past with empty plates. He shouted a grunting noise at our little boy which made other diners look round and frighten our little boy. Yes, maybe he should have been sitting but the waiter could have been a little more 'child friendly' and spoke rather than shouted.

On appearance hotel is good but the rest is not unfortunately.",2,2015,10,31
218,"Beautiful Hotel, great location","I recently stayed for the third time at this hotel and just love it.  Absolutely beautiful hotel & grounds. Staff are very friendly and helpful. If you want to just chill the spa is gorgeous, with a hairdressers on the grounds.  It is great that so many things are close by, for shopping Kildare Village, highly recommend a trip to Newbridge Silver or the National Stud.  I have recommended this to all my friends and will definitely return. Phil",5,2015,10,30
218,"Room disapppointing, service equally so. We left within a couple of hours.","We booked a triple room for a one night spa break at the hotel. Its actually quite pretty from the outside. We checked in and decided to pay on check in, we thought it would be more convenient. I will never make that mistake again - always see the room before you pay! Our triple room was awful and looked nothing like the rooms on the website. There were two standard double beds and then a narrow single bed stuck against a wall. No headboard, literally mattress and base with one pillow. We were not informed on booking that there would be two doubles and one single. The room was dark, gloomy and smelled of damp. There was an array of mismatched furniture in the room, but no obvious television or tea / coffee making facilities. The enamel in the bath was chipping off, the sink didn't drain correctly, the toilet paper dispenser was hanging off the wall and there were two hand towels provided for three guests. We were so disappointed. It was quite late, after 8.30pm, so we went downstairs to get some food in the bar. We ordered three starters, two sides of chunky chips, two soft drinks and a cider, and two desserts. It was inedible and at €70, totally overpriced. The food was greasy and totally unappetising. We decided to approach Reception to ask for a different room. After a couple of snide remarks from the Receptionist about how there was nothing better available in our price bracket and how we must have a very good memory for recalling another (better) room one of our party had stayed in on a previous occasion, a couple of alternative rooms were shown to us. They were no improvement on the one booked. We did a quick Google of other hotels in the area and found a 5 star nearby with availability for an extra €80. We approached Reception again to say we wanted to leave because of the sub standard service and the poor quality room. The cancellation policy was quoted by the manager. We stood our ground and finally managed to get our card refunded. When we said we wanted to leave we were offered an upgrade to a suite but at that stage we were so annoyed and disappointed, it was just too little too late.",1,2015,10,30
218,Fabulous hotel ,Cormac went above and beyond to help us around the huge hotel and make us feel comfortable. He was very helpful and nothing was too much bother for him. The lady on the desk as we arrived was very unhelpful and uninterested in showing us to our room which was confusing to get to. We changed our mind on the opinion of the staff thanks to Cormac. The luxurious hotel was very comfortable and the signer in the bar was enjoyable. ,5,2015,10,29
218,Two Night Spa Break,"Just returned from a two day stay at the hotel. Very welcoming staff, can't do enough for you. Bedroom very spacious with two double beds. Excellent wi-fi coverage. Good tv if you wanted to rest in your room. Spa including hydrotherapy pool is super and the treatments are excellent value. Food delicious. All in, a reasonably priced, very relaxed weekend. Highly recommend this hotel.",4,2015,10,28
218,Disappointing,"This Hotel may at some time been a 4* but not more, wooden sticks instead of spoons in our room, The Bistro suffered from an obvious lack of staff resulting in poor service ( however a member of staff did find time to throw something at the barman which missed him and was dodged by my wife) it had a poor menu and was overpriced , on Monday they provided a film night resulting in the foyer looking like a slightly up market Mc Donalds , with loads of screaming kids ..when they went for their film food remained in the area and the rest of their mess. I was told that there was a very nice bar there called Jacks Bar, on arrival I could not find it , when I enq'd with staff I was told . ''this is it '' I was in the Bistro ??? Jacks bar was not found during our stay.So we will not be returning to this hotel or recommending it to friends .... Just one plus point .. front desk staff on arrival very polite and helpful. .. wont be returning .. I have visited many 3 star hotels that beat the Killashee Hotel",3,2015,10,27
218,Amazing place to stay,"We are a well traveled couple, but this hotel really is 10 out of 10,  great place in luxury sorrundings, staff very friendly and rooms were perfect !
Nothing bad to say about this place , only regret was having to leave !",5,2015,10,27
218,Historic hotel,"Stayed here for a conference. Check in was slow and the receptionist continually  answered the phone in addition to trying to deal with people standing at the desk, so I didn't feel very welcome. 

My room was in the old part of the hotel and was really lovely - old style with a 4 poster bed which was very comfortable. There were lovely views of the garden from one of the windows. 

I very much liked the fact that there was a small booklet in the room detailing the interesting history of the place. 

There is a small carpark close to the hotel entrance, but most guests have to park at the back of the hotel - it's quite a long walk there. However, there is some short-term parking right in front of the hotel. 

Dinner was nice - tasty, well-cooked, good service. Breakfast needed much more attention to detail - lots of food items ran out and there were not many staff members there to assist. 

Overall, a pleasant stay, but simple things, mainly pertaining to staff at reception and breakfast, would have made a big difference.",3,2015,10,26
218,Still a 5 star quality.,Just returned from 3 day stay at Killashee House Hotel with two friends. It was our second trip and we were not disappointed. Enjoyed every minute of it. All the staff were both friendly and helpful. Special thank you to  Lisa at reception and staff in the Bistro/ Lounge. Meals were excellent- our compliments to the chef for presentation. Bedroom was lovely with all the little extras and beautiful view of the lovely manicured gardens. Special retail therapy at Kildare Village and Newbridge Silverware - definitely not to be missed. Thank you Killashee.,5,2015,10,24
218,thank you to all the staff,"went here for a weekend wedding in September, food and staff excellent.Very helpful staff from the receptionists to the waiting staff.
Gardens and grounds well kept,Costs very reasonable for a weekend package",5,2015,10,24
218,"FRIENDLY STAFF, GOOD QUALITY ROOMS AND SUPERB FOOD","Our fifth time to stay at the hotel, though our first over a weekend.
We stayed for 2 nights bed and breakfast with an evening meal in Turners Restaurant.  
Rooms are of good quality, well decorated and spotless.

There was a wedding on the Friday of our arrival, unfortunately the music was extremely loud, loud enough to sing along - woken at 1.15am, we telephoned reception to find out what time the music would finish --- 2am.

Music was turned down and the doors to the venue were closed -  this certainly did make a difference.  We asked for a night porter to bring a fan to the room to drown out the noise and this worked.

Breakfast the following morning was very good - good selection from the buffet - excellent freshly made eggs benedict.

As there was also a wedding on the Saturday we asked to be moved room.  We packed up our bags and whilst out for the day we were moved to a different room on the other side of the hotel.  This was perfect and we had an uninterrupted night's sleep.

Our evening meal in Turners was the rival of any top-class restaurant - really good quality food and silver service by very friendly staff.

The staff did deal with our issue over the noise really well, it would certainly not put us off staying again - though we would insist on a room facing the gardens.

Staff were friendly and professional - no hesitations recommending.",4,2015,10,21
218,"Nice hotel , great food. Worth one visit.","We booked into Killashee as my wife had stayed there a while ago with her Nana and were given a voucher from family members. We booked to stay on the sunday, the day of my birthday. First impression were great , hotel and grounds look amazing. We arrived before check in and made our way to the bar area which was nice, with the world cup on we settled in with a pint. Big wedding on the night before and had to wait until 3pm to check in which is fair. My wife had booked in for a pregnancy massage and enjoyed it thoroughly, and was delighted not to recieve the hard sell of products that she has had from other spas in the past. Booked into hotel restaurant for dinner and welcomed other family members who live close by. Lovely meal with great service. Food really was excellent. Retired for the evening looking forward to a long lie in afforded by the wonderfully long breakfast times. First hotel ive ever been in that allows you to have breakfast until 11am !!! We had planned to make use of this late breakfast time but were unfortunately woken by a delivery or rubbish truck arrving at 8am. As this was a break away from our 2 yo son we were especially looking forward to a long lazy morning but this was not to be. Breakfast buffet was to a good standard and nothing was too much trouble for staff to fetch. 

Took in a nice walk of the gardens after our breakfast and made our way home. Overall we liked the hotel but maybe feel that more consideration could have been given to room allocation. The hotel was mostly empty on the sunday night so perhaps didnt have to have the room overlooking the delivery area. Some of the decor is a little dated but enjoyable stay nonetheless. 

Having stayed in much better hotels for the price payed we would probably not rush back to Killashee but had a good time. Minor issue with cobwebs in corner of room and hitting my head getting of bed a couple of times due to tables overhanging bed but nothing major to merit a complaint.

Not 100% if i put on requests that is was my birthday but would normally mention it in the requests section but nothing was offered or even said when checking which compared to other hotels is disappointing.",4,2015,10,20
218,Disappointed night away,The grounds are lovely and outside staff very friendly. But the attention to detail inside has a lot to be desire. When we went to book in the staff were unfriendly and then told us we only had one room booked even though I had booked two rooms back in may. The girl didn't deal with it very well. On book I had asked for the two rooms together - however this seem to be an issue and eventually at 6 o'clock the second room was available beside us. We were told it would be ready around 5.15 and that we would be told when it was ready but we had to chase it up (not something I would expect in a 4 star hotel) The staff in the bistro were lovely that lunch time and evening but the bar and bistro area needs a major clean. The cobwebs on the lights at the table were disgraceful. The floor was dirty and the tables sticky. That night there was one lovely bar man but no staff to help clean away tables. In the spa the relaxation room wasn't very relaxing as it seem dirty and wasn't being clean between clients - glass left and blankets not tidy up. Didn't entice you to relax. The spa staff were nice. But the pedicure treatment is wrong described as it was a paint and file. Two of our party had this treatment but one never even got there feet soaked which you would consider the norm for a pedicure. The breakfast room was unappealing and the staff uniforms were dirty and the room itself wasn't clean. The bedroom were nice but again they need a good dusty especially around the television area the dust was disgracefully I could write in it. One shower cap in the bathroom!! what's the other guest meant to use?? On checkout again we had the same lady that checked us in she wasn't very friendly and didn't even ask us was everything ok and that she would print out our receipt. Just told me the price which was wrong as we were on a package deal. All in all remind me of fawlty towers. and I most definitely wouldn't be recommending it to anyone. I had the image that this was a luxury hotel but its' not!!,2,2015,10,20
218,Disappointing Afternoon Tea,"The afternoon tea menu at Killashee  Hotel boasted speciality sandwiches    of ""Honey Baked Ham, Smoked Emmental Cheese & Tomato Chutney On Onion Bread"". However we were sorely disappointed when a slimy, sweaty, sliver of pre-packed ham, a processed cheddar slice and a meagre dot of red chutney arrived on plain white bread. Their ""homemade brown bread"" was so thick and dry I was tempted to use it as a door stop, rather than actually eat it. The ""egg, parsley and lemon mayonnaise"" lacked the parsley and lemon. The finger pastries and small cakes were average at best. Unfortunately the disappointment continued as we were served our ""Loose Leaf Tea"". You might think, what could go wrong with tea? The waitress wheeled over the tea trolley and proceeded to discreetly open ordinary tea bags and empty the contents of the bags into our tea pots. This is not loose leaf tea by any standards! The experience was topped off nicely by sitting in the opulent dining room listening to a CD of 90s boy bands greatest hits, including Backstreet Boys, Boyzone and even Boyz 2 Men. In summary this was a total let-down. If you are looking for somewhere to enjoy a delicious and indulgent special treat of afternoon tea, Killashee hotel is not the place.",2,2015,10,16
218,A perfect venue with amazing staff,My husband and I had our wedding on the 25th September 2015 at Killashee.... We honestly cannot say enough about the experience we had at Killashee. The staff there are second to none - Katie and Aoife ensured everything was organized before the day and on the day Andrew the amazing manager took care of everything ! If it weren't for these three superstars I don't know know how it would it have come together. I have to say every staff member plays a part in the experience. All we can say from here is .. Thank you for giving us the time of our lives xxxxx,5,2015,10,15
218,Big old fashioned building...,"Spent a night recently. Got there late afternoon. Nice reception welcome. Getting to the room was a bit of a maze. Looking through the corridor windows was depressing...room was vast, well appointed but not decorated last year...last century surely...bathroom big but old fashioned and with spiderwebs...got some roomservice and it was fresh and nice and well prepared. BUT surprise : someone knocked on the door at 23:00 !!! To get the roomservice tray back...HEY THAT'S too late...shower was hot and high pressure water. TV on the tiny side. Very good bed. Overall, got a bit of charm. Has horrible view from the even rooms on this long grey building. 

",3,2015,10,15
218,A beautiful location just outside Dublin,"Stayed here for a night enroute and its very handy just off the motorway after you drive through Naas.  The old building looks very impressive as you drive up to it. When I arrived there was no one at reception, but eventually someone came after about 5 minutes.  Room was quite a walk from reception, but very spacious and comfortable including the bed. In the morning I went out for a walk and discovered the beautiful gardens and woodland walks which were a pleasant surprise, they are more what you would expect in a stately home.  Breakfast was excellent with an extensive hot and cold buffet and some items cooked to order, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It is great to see a hotel working to deliver good food in the morning as well as other times of day which so many fail to do. Would certainly return again for business or pleasure. ",4,2015,10,15
218,Lovely afternoon tea location ,"I haven't stayed at the hotel but had a lovely afternoon tea and walk in the grounds. The tea selection was lovely and staff were very attentive, the location is beautiful and I'd certainly be tempted to go back for a stay.",4,2015,10,10
218,Great again ,"Stayed for one night during Irish champions weekend, again found the hotel to be excellent. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Breakfast very nice and staff friendly. We will be back in April for punchestown and the hotel is without doubt the place to stay. ",5,2015,10,07
218,Terrible customer service from management down,"I stayed at Killashee in early September for my brother's wedding and while my experience of the hotel while there was a very pleasant one, the experience I had dealing with the hotel after the fact was terrible. My husband forgot a couple of items in the room (one of which was rather expensive). After a number of calls to the hotel, following promises of call backs which never happened, I finally spoke to a nice girl in house keeping who said they had the items and explained that I needed to put a self addressed envelop in the post to have them returned - all fine. When a week passed and nothing turned up I called the hotel again to be told that they received my envelop but would need to find out the status. Again promises of calls back, which never happened. Numerous calls and emails later (even direct to the Manager) I finally gave up and my husband called into the hotel. He was told that the items were posted. Obviously I don't know for sure what happened but I know that the way the hotel dealt with the situation was disgraceful! I share the experience of the 'bed bugs' reviewer who had a similar experience of non response. To me as a hotel guest / customer it is the overall customer experience that matters and Killashee obviously don't care about this. I gave the hotel staff, from the manager down, every opportunity to call me / email me back and explain the situation but they didn't. Therefore, the last thing I now want is a response here to add insult to injury! I think it is important, however, to be aware that if anything goes wrong during your stay you might not get the helpful response that you would hope for.",1,2015,10,06
218,"Excellent hotel, but better out of wedding season","Second time this year of staying. Staff as friendly as ever, especially housekeeping who all made an effort to say good morning. 

Only downside this stay was that we could hear the music from the weddings being held, which went on until after 2am, so would recommend a room on outside as couldn't be heard in them (had family staying in room opposite).

Would recommend and would probably go back, but probably not in wedding season.",4,2015,10,05

We had a family room and it was plenty big comfy lovely beds
Bistro had lovely varied menu with lovely food go for the ribs they were to die for",5,2015,10,05
218,Breakfast ,We decided to go out for breakfast one Sunday morning. It was very like a cattle mart. The staff were running here there and everywhere it was so busy. We gave our seats up early with guilt as people were queing like a Ryanair flight to get in and sit in our seats. The food was buffet style and cold. Right beside me is was like a steel works with young staff sorting knives and forks clashing and banging cuttelry. Pity for such a beautiful hotel. Far from relaxing and peaceful. ,1,2015,10,04
218,Recently refurbished now as nice as the staff,"I have stayed in this hotel many times over the years attending an annual conference there. Last time the decor seemed a little tired so I was delighted on this trip to see that it has had a makeover but kept its unique charm. The key to this is the outstanding staff who just know how to make you feel special. This last visit I stayed in one of the suites in the old house, it had been nicely redecorated and was most comfortable. Oh did I mention the food - great quality and quantity too.  Highly recommended ",5,2015,10,02
218,Very good place and service,"I stayed in a hotel for 2 months. And i don't have any complaints. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, they helped to solve all my wishes. Good breakfast with opportunity to order something different if you like. Small presents in the room such as wine or dessert made my stay joyful. Rooms are spacious and quite, wedding parties was held every weekend, but it didn't disturb my stay. Every weekend in a bar you can listen to live music and enjoy dinner and drinks. A small minus maybe that the sport club and pool is in the different house and you have go through the yard.",5,2015,09,30
218,Old-New nice mix,"Stayed one night for a conference in this mix of an old manor house type and the new wing, about 40 minutes drive from the Dublin airport. I got a really wonderfully nice room in the old wing with high ceiling, great outside view, and comfortable bed. All usual facilities - in room coffee/tea with biscuits, nice big bathroom and good quality materials; good quality conference dinner, generous wide ranging breakfast buffet etc etc; did not have time to enjoy their spa and other health facilities, but had a chance to walk around in the beautiful gardens. Efficient free wifi.",5,2015,09,28
218,Well decorated and landscaped hotel,"Beautiful, well decorated hotel with beautiful surroundings. Our room however was quite far from the entrance and reception, but quite nice, spacious and comfy. Breakfast I thought was good and the staffs were mostly polite and professional apart from one male staff who was standing right in front of the entrance of the breakfast area (could be the head staff but I'm not fully sure) that was making some annoying remarks and maybe trying to be funny, which I felt was out of place for such a hotel. Some people who came to the hotel just for the breakfast were also told to wait at the side (despite many empty tables) until they serve all the people staying at the hotel, which I felt was ridiculous.",4,2015,09,27
218,Our Wedding,"We booked our wedding in May 2014 - from the moment we booked it until the moment we checked out in August 2015 we received the very best service. Whether it be in Jacks Bar, the hotel reception or in the restaurant at breakfast we cannot fault the service, the friendly environment or the relaxing atmosphere in all areas of the hotel.
Dee the hotel manger, Katie our wedding co-ordinator, Killian our wedding manager and to all the staff who helped us enjoy the organisation and the running of our wedding day we cannot thank you enough. 
We had the day we had always dreamed of and cannot wait to come back for our year anniversary. We are looking forward to it already!
See you all soon

On behalf of Joyce & I, I would like to sincerely thank you and your staff for making Emma & John’s wedding such a special occasion.

I can honestly say that each of our 210 guests were massively impressed with every aspect of the wedding from the beautiful drive in to Killashee, to the welcome reception, the quality of the food and the professionalism of the staff. Your banqueting manager and Alison (who served the top table) also received special praise from those who engaged with them.

I was also particularly impressed that you managed to roster many of the same staff on the 2nd day which worked really well.

Emma is our only child and we wanted her wedding to be very special. Thanks, in no small way, to all the team in Killashee, this was achieved and she really did have the happiest day of her life.

Please accept our sincere thanks and extend our appreciation to all of your colleagues.   

John and Joyce",5,2015,09,25
218,A dream palace,"The building is stunning, the rooms were clean the staff were great especially in the bar, and the decode so beautiful have a very memorable trip ! Exscuisit place . the bar had a beautiful fire that kept outside warm in the cold weather! The spa , myself my Mam and my nanny and aunty all had treatments great value for money would deffinatly return to this place. ",5,2015,09,22
218,Perfect choice,After long flights from NZ arriving here was perfect.  From the time we turned into the tree lined drive way and approached Killashee we felt relaxed.  The staff were all very friendly the room spacious and welcoming.  The restaurant and bar is popular with the locals also and is  a lovely place to sit and relax or mix with the locals.  After dinner we walked around the extensive gardens before having an exceptionally good Irish coffee back in the bar.  Breakfast was a very good introduction to the full Irish breakfast and our very helpful waiter made the experience most enjoyable.  From  check in to check out our stay was great.  The perfect choice for us just a pity we only stayed one night due to time constraints.,4,2015,09,22
218,Lovely country side hotel,"I felt very sick when I arrived into this hotel. Although in our country was more than 30 degrees that time, here was just 15 and I had to cover with extra cover on the bad to not get ""frozen"". I had to stay in bed whole afternoon and I appreciated the self-service and minibar in the room. There was a strange smell in the room but it can happen in older hotels like this one. The breakfast was nice (self-service and also served one).  Nice place to stay. Unfortunately I couldn´t visit the spa, maybe next time.",4,2015,09,22
218,Good Value,"We decided to stay here on way from airport 
Got great room at very reasonable rate including breakfast 
Breakfast -buffet -  was good but lacked some things I would regard as standard for 4* - eg fresh juices 
Overall a good value experience",4,2015,09,18
218,Afternoon tea,"Enjoyed my first afternoon tea at the Killashee hotel . The quality of the fare was very good,  one small criticism was the banana cake was bland . When pointed out to our server Sarah she returned with a complimentary plate  of goodies to takeaway and an offer of prosecco also complimentary  (not accepted ). All in all a positive experience ",4,2015,09,17
218,Hungry ,"Checked in no problems 

Arrived in my room 
Ordered room service 
Room service never arrived 
Rang reception an hour later 10:15pm to be told there was a mix up with the order.
Dinner is now a biscuit and a cup of tea.
I am very annoyed having left Letterkenny at 17:30.
This is some way to treat your paying guests.
",1,2015,09,16
218,Afternoon Tea . .,"This is the perfect hotel to enjoy Afternoon Tea. It oozes sophisticated charm in an old world setting and has the perfect ambiance for Afternoon Tea. Served in the restaurant which is a large bright ornate room, decorated with beautiful chandeliers, crisp white linen table cloths and delicate floral plates and tea-cups. If this type of room is not your thing, the Bistro has a more modern decor with sleek lines and darker lighting, it also has a bar.

The tea itself comes in a variety of different flavours from earl grey, spiced tea, blood orange to regular breakfast tea, coffee and hot chocolate. There are top-ups offered during your dining. There is also the option of a glass of Prosecco for an additional €5 (no top-up's with this sadly !) 

Each cake stand serves one or two people and has a selection of savoury and sweet cakes, scone with fresh cream & jam and 3 small sandwiches. I personally would have preferred half /half sandwiches and cakes as the cakes were sickly sweet there were so many. I'm also being picky here when I say instead of one large scone there should have been maybe 2 x small scones in fitting with the small cakes on the stand. But all beautifully presented and boxed to take home if you can't finish them !

Overall this is a great location for Afternoon Tea to catch up with friends, spend time with your partner, birthday celebration, for a baby shower or low key hens party. I would definetly recommend the Kilashee House Hotel.",4,2015,09,15
218,Great room in an old-fashioned hotel,"The Killashee is a big, old-fashioned hotel will big spaces and big rooms.  Our room was certainly comfortable and well equipped - the bed was comfortable and there were chairs, tables, desks and lots of space.  The lighting is a bit poor - no overhead light and the lamps are not very bright (is that too picky?).  It is a bit of a maze finding your way around because the hotel is spread over different sections, none of which seem to be easily accessible from the others.  The only minor disappointment really was breakfast - the buffet was very good with lots of choices (hot and cold) and the service was adequate, but the menu card on the table says you can have breakfast cooked to order including pancakes and other selections, but when we asked for the pancakes the waitress said (in the nicest possible way) that there are pancakes on the buffet so we could help ourselves.  Kind of missed the point of having freshly cooked pancakes with maple syrup and cinnamon sugar on a menu card if they are not going to deliver!  Otherwise, it was a pleasant and relaxing overnight stay.",4,2015,09,15
218,"""Fab Time""","Had a lovely time here in august with my wife and daughter. Dinner on both nights was served in the bistro, tasty food with good service and great breakfast buffet. Beautiful grounds with great pool/leisure centre were you can unwind for hours.Well worth a visit look forward to returning.",5,2015,09,13
218,Spa Break with the Girls,"Myself & three friends have just returned from a wonderful spa break at the very beautiful Killashee House Spa Hotel. I was celebrating my 40th birthday & the staff went over & above to ensure that our stay was magical. The bedrooms were fabulous, each room contained two double beds - We were all able to lay like starfish for the two nights……..HEAVENLY! Turners restaurant is closed midweek, but the hotel bistro was lively, with a great atmosphere & delicious food. The bistro manager, Daniel, was a true gent - He ensured that our stay was memorable & made a point of  marking my birthday with candles & singing. Our spa experience was also wonderful; massage, facials & the hydrotherapy suite, what a wonderful way to de-stress! Thank you to all the staff at the Killashee, I look forward to my next visit!",5,2015,09,10
218,Awful,Had to stay there for a week due to business trip (from 29-08-2015 till 05-09-2015). While check-in accommodation fees were frozen on my credit card. When I checked-out the same sum was wrote off from my account for the second time. And the first sum is still frozen and not available for me. Now I have to spend a lot of time dealing with my bank to get my money back. So be careful with your payments.,1,2015,09,08
218,BED BUGS!!!,"For my 30th birthday weekend my fiance took me to stay at the killashee for the weekend of the 14th and 15th of August I was really happy with the suprise as I have stayed here before and I loved it but this time was a whole different experience he had asked for a nice room as it was a special weekend we were told we would have a dulux room or a suite on arrival to the room it was a very standard shabby bedroom so we rang reception to be told we would be moved to a suite the following day which we agreed to so the next day we moved to our suite It seemed nice but when we went to go to sleep that night I felt something crawl on my face I brushed it off and seen it was a bed bug!! We had a really bad restless night and we left at 8.30 the next morning horrified and covered head to toe in bites.. when we rang the hotel the manager explained that she would have to investigate and after nearly 3 weeks and numourous phone calls and emails from me she finally called us back and said the inspection of the room came back there was no bed bugs but yet I have photos of the bites and actually seen them with my own eyes.. then she continued to ask ""what exactly would you like us to do""? I found this very unhelpful and she brushed it off like it was nothing the reason for the late review is we were giving the hotel a chance to reply to us but as they have no intrest in resolving this matter I dicided to leave review.",1,2015,09,08
218,A lovely hotel in a beautiful setting,"I've been here a few time over the years usually on courses from work and once at a wedding. The staff are always very nice and the hotel and grounds are always immaculate. The food is always first class. I would recommend a visit. If the rooms are as nice as the public area, it would be a great place to stay.",5,2015,09,07
218,Fab Afternoon Tea,"From start to finish our afternoon tea celebration was perfect.... from the booking to arrival we were treated royally.  Both Tomas and Sarah were superb, and made our little celebration so nice.  We had both ends of the scale with us a one and a half year old and 86 year old Nan and Granda - but this was not bother to the staff they accommodated us perfectly.  The food was gorgeous, and the cake we ordered was scrumptious.  Highly recommend Afternoon Tea in Killahsee",5,2015,09,07
218,Outstanding service with the biggest of smiles,"What a hotel great service and the food is amazing. We were their for two nights and i wish we could of stayed for a week. We had food in the bistro on the two nights it was out of this world. On the last night we dined in turners the food was innovative, exciting and refreshing to see in a 4 star hotel . The food was 5 star at a very reasonable price . The chefs must have been in high demand as the food made our stay. Will definatly be returning solely for the food",5,2015,09,04
218,Very impressive stay,We spent two nights at Killashee Hotel in August. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds. The staff were very attentive and friendly. We are a family of six so it can be challenging to find hotels and rooms that suit. We ate in the hotel on two nights and were very impressed with the food and quality of it. There was a mix up in a order we placed and the manager fixed it with no fuss. This allowed a family meal continue with no fuss. The room we stayed in was very spacious and of good decor. Very nice buffet breakfast available in the morning also.,5,2015,09,04
218,Lovely,"We'd a lovely stay in the hotel, with the price of our overnight being significantly cheaper than what we'd booked it at!
The pool facilities are great and the rooms are lovely. Wifi available and a hidden TV!
The options for breakfast are good, but some baked beans as an additional option in the cooked breakfast would have been nice.
There were mix ups with our orders for dinner, but the food was really lovely.
Some speed restrictions in the car park would be good, as the cars can pickup some speed, and with 2 small children it was a little scary.
Despite that, We'll come back!",5,2015,09,03
218,Family wedding ,"Stayed in killashee 3 nights for family wedding. From entering hotel until leaving I cannot fault it. Stayed in a suite and it was beautiful. All my family stayed here also and no complaints from anyone. Food was excellent in the bar and not to expensive. Breakfast also very good. Wedding reception was fantastic and there were plenty of staff on duty for 160 people. The grounds are fabulous. Went to spa also and therapist was excellent. This is an honest review from a very satisfied customer. 
",5,2015,08,31
218,Beautiful wedding venue ,Myself and my husband got married here and we had a fantastic time.  The suites and rooms are spacious and beautiful. The staff were very accommodating and looked after us very well. I have eaten in the restaurant and bar on numerous occasions and it was always fab. Look forward to staying here soon for a wedding anniversary. ,5,2015,08,31
218,Highly recommended,"Lovely hotel, very nice staff and beautiful grounds. Stayed there for 1 night recently in family room, 2 adults and 3 kids. Plenty of room and worked well for trip to Dublin. Grounds are really well kept with lovely walks around including butterfly garden.",4,2015,08,29
218,Nice.,"My wife and I stayed here for a midweek break in August. It was going to be our only chance to get away for the summer so I we went for a Junior Suite. We were going to a play in the Bord Gais the evening of our arrival so I had explained when I had made my booking that it would be after 11pm before we would be checking in, I was told that this would not be a problem. When we did arrive we were given room 312, which is a nice walk from reception. The room is quite large and had a good sized bathroom. We did note however that there was no milk on the tea/coffee tray so we couldn't have a cuppa, nor was there any bottled water. 
After a good nights sleep we went down for breakfast, the selection and quality of which were second to none, a really nice start to the day. 
The hotel is in a lovely location and we drove the short distance to the Kildare Village  Outlet Centre where we spent the morning browsing in the shops, after lunch we headed back to the hotel where my wife had booked into some Spa treatments. I took the opportunity to relax in the hotel room but was disappointing at the lack of channels available on the TV, some were only available in black and white, Film4 was sound and no picture and CNN wasn't there at all. 
At about 8pm we were going to get something to eat, we had taken the 2BB1D option but didn't know if we had to book the time for dinner so decided to ring down to reception to find out, unfortunately the phone in the room didn't work. We went down to reception and explained all our woes and the receptionist said she would see what she could do.
We went to the restaurant and booked dinner for 9, this gave us time to walk and relax in the gardens of the hotel. Dinner was lovely. Later when we returned to our room the milk and water had been sorted but that was all. There was a fair bit of noise from the wedding reception that was going on in another part of the hotel, it is a popular wedding venue, a room to the front of the hotel may have been quieter.
Breakfast the following morning was as good as the day before over all I'd say the food, both the dinner and the breakfast, and the table service were excellent, a real credit to the establishment.
Would I stay again, yes, would I spend the extra on the suite, probably not.",4,2015,08,28
218,Lovely place,Here for two nights with my wife and 19 month old daughter. Great large room with good sized bath and lovely meals at a reasonable rate. If you are staying here don't eat anywhere else! Very impressed with how child friendly it is. They were even able to led us a DVD which my daughter really enjoyed.,5,2015,08,27
218,Great family break,Everyone of us loved this hotel.  Very classy. The breakfast has to be the nicest I've ever had in a hotel. Was just finished my fry when the lady looking after us asked me was I ready for pancakes. I could of hugged her,4,2015,08,26

218,Very happy bride and groom!,"We held our wedding in Killashee last month and couldn't be happier with our decision to do so. It was an absolutely fantastic day and we can't thank the staff of Killashee enough for making everything run so smoothly. 

The weddings department were lovely to deal with and were very attentive to all our questions and requests. It was very reassuring to be in such professional and capable hands.

I have nothing but praise for all the staff who looked after us on the day itself. Our two duty managers and all the service  staff were so friendly and attentive and it was really noticed by our guests. We really felt very well looked after. The bar staff were brilliant, really friendly and up for a laugh, all the while doing a great job of making everyone happy.

The food was absolutely delicious. We were thrilled that it was just as good on the when prepared for over 120 people as it was on the day of our tasting. We have received so many compliments from our guests  with the beef fillet medallions for the main and  and the strawberry mille-feuille for dessert  going down particularly well. 

Having our evening reception in the original house just made the day really special. It's such a beautiful house and great for a creating making things feel more intimate and fun. We really felt at home there. 

The hotel itself is fantastic, it's got real character and a great history. All the staff we encountered during our two nights there (and on number of visits in the lead up to the wedding), in the reception, in the restaurant, in the main bar, were all friendly and professional. There were renovations carried out in the six month lead up the wedding and they really snazzed the place up without changing it's character.

The bedrooms were lovely. We stayed in the main hotel the night before the wedding, and from the basic double up to the bridal suite, the rooms were all of a good quality, very clean and spacious. We stayed in the original house for the night of the wedding and managed to peek into a few of the suites there and they were all great - loads of character and each with an individual sense of style. The room with access to the bell tower was particularly cool. 

We asked some of our guests if they had any complaints, and other than one room key not working and a few people finding it difficult to find their rooms in the main hotel, there really were no complaints. We were delighted that everyone was treated to a really high level of service throughout their stay, and really can't recommend Killashee highly enough both as a wedding venue, and as a lovely place to stay.",5,2015,08,24
218,Top wedding destination,"Myself and my new wife had our wedding reception here and we absolutely loved the venue. 
Food, decor and staff are all amazing, we got great feedback from our guests. The grounds have beautiful gardens also.  
Katie our wedding consultant was professional and friendly from start to finish. Katie kept us at ease with the planning and really knows all the details needed for an wonderful wedding reception. 
On the day Roisin (the manager on duty) and her staff looked after our party very well. Every member of staff was friendly and professional. 
All I can say is that the Kilashee Hotel know how to put on a beautiful wedding day. 
Would highly recommend ",5,2015,08,24
218,Top drawer €€€,Stayed here for a wedding .service was frst rate food was very good . Decor was a mix of old and new . Nice gardens to have a short walk around . Was a bit pricey especially for drinks as it caters for a higher class of clientel . But was a great experience for a one off .,4,2015,08,23
218,Wedding Bliss ,"I stayed in this hotel last weekend as part of a wedding. On arrival at the grounds of the hotel, it was so picturesque.. Lawn cut to exquisitvely, the entrance in was like going to a magical wonderland. The hotel itself from the outside is beautiful, not modern looking - so pretty. Parking is available everywhere. Although we couldnt see our car, there was no doubt about the safety of it. We entered the hotel through the bar - as we hadn't a clue where the hotel entrance was - the staff in the bar quickly helped us to reception. There was over 50 couples and families checking in at the same time as us. There was 4 on reception, who flew through the check-in. They directed us perfectly to the lift, and to our room. Our room was beautiful, nodern and elegant - we spent little time here bar sleeping, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The room wasn't too hot or too cold it was just perfect. We went to the old part of the house for the drinks, where we were provided with wine on entrance and a few bits to pick at. The outside grounds were beautfiul, and i can only imagine the photos the bride and groom got were amazing. We were called for dinner at 5.45. Dinner was out at 6.15. Everyone had just been seated. They brought out the food so quickly and all together that no one was left waiting. The meal itself was beautiful. The thompson suite is the perfect spot. Also the bar staff were run off their feet all night, but didnt fail to leave anyone out. I would highly recommend anyone planning a stay, or a wedding to speak to Killashee, as they are nothing short of perfect",5,2015,08,23
218,Anniversary night away,"Lovely hotel with friendly staff, very good food and really nice gardens. The main building where the reception, bistro and restaurants are is really nice and we enjoyed lunch, drinks and dinner there. Our room was nice, but a long way from everything, and it was a bit confusing trying to find it the first time. We were looking forward to having a drink in The Snug bar, but it was closed for a small private party on a Friday night which was disappointing. We also mistakenly thought that the pool and leisure center was just for the hotel, but when it discovered it was open to the public and very busy, we decided to stay away. Overall, we had a really nice stay and would stay there again.",3,2015,08,23
218,Fantastic,"Fab Hotel,

Very helpful staff, great Bistro Bar-food, didn't get a chance to try the restaurant for dinner but breakfast was top notch, excellent buffet, cereals, fresh pastries, fresh meats, fresh fruits, full Irish breakfast, as well as breakfasts made to order, no problems and always plenty of everything.

The hotel catered for families and there were lots of young children around but this didn't seem to put in on business guests in the hotel. 

The building itself is amazing, I'm sure many stories it could tell, but it is also complimented by its gardens and grounds, from the wonderful drive along Kilashee View, the Butterfly and Fountain Gardens, just amazing.

I would like to see wifi in the rooms, not just public areas, and also were were disturbed by deliveries in the morning (which the hotel couldn't do enough about to rectify, and very appreciative that it was brought to their attention). There was a lot of up and down in lifts and figuring them out, and getting to the spa was a trek through the hotel, however given the age of the building and the character of where you are walking, relax, take it in your stride and enjoy your surrounds.
We can't wait to return to Kilashee. Fabulous Hotel
",5,2015,08,21
218,Delicious and Luxurious Afternoon Tea,"I visited Killashee with my fiancee on Sunday 16 August 2015 for a bit of a birthday celebration.

1. The venue is gorgeous. When you enter the grounds you are met by a long drive up to the House which is partially shaded by trees. Spectacular entrance.

2. The rooms are lovely. We were escorted to the tea room towards the back of the house, which was well lit and very nicely decorated. I had a nice view of the gardens through one of the windows.

3. The service was exceptional. We were attended to by Daniel and two others who were extremely attentive. We really felt like special guests, despite the place being reasonably busy (and the fact that we were paying by voucher, which we had already stated before our tea).

4. The food was both delicious and generous. In fact, so generous that we had trouble finishing it! We were first treated to savoury sandwiches, followed by a three-tiered tray of scones, cakes, and desserts. We were invited to try different teas and have top-ups which I really enjoy (nothing worse than stinginess when it comes to tea).

We really enjoyed a special afternoon out. We spent over two hours, taking our time with our food and tea and afterwards we walked around the gardens including the lovely Butterfly Garden.

Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,20
218,Lovely hotel,"Stayed in killashee house hotel for two nights! When checking in, staff in particular Eilís was very professional and very helpful! The room was lovely really comfortable beds. The food in the bistro was a delight as was our waitress Simona!! The breakfast was great lots of choice and the dining room itself is gorgeous! Will definitely be recommending this hotel to family/friends and also coming back for another visit!",5,2015,08,20
218,Not  a problem,"We stayed in this hotel for about 3 days and had our breakfast and evening meals in the dining room. The constant reply I heard from the friendly staff when asked by a guest to carry out a request was that it ""could be done and it was not a problem"". If the guest thanked the staff member there followed the  reply ""you are welcome.    I found this friendly polite approach throughout all my interactions with the staff, from cleaning personnel, to gym instructor's to waiting and reception staff. It was to say the least very refreshing and made us as guests feel ""realistically valued, safe and pampered"".The hotel itself has a majestic charm that oozes with character and history. Fining dining and relaxation are well catered for, and for the energetic there is well fitted out gym and spa area. Families are very welcome and the rooms were fresh airy and spotless .The hotel itself is a great base to use whilst venturing further afield to enjoy some shopping sightseeing .The weather and the beautiful grounds added to our enjoyment however I would also like to revisit on a blowy autumn/winter day and enjoy the comforting embrace of Killashee House",5,2015,08,18
218,Shopping break,"My wife and I stayed for two days on an over 55s offer. The room was excellent as was the breakfast. The meals in the bistro were good but not exceptional and the bistro itself is part of a large bar. A big disappointment was that the fine dining option was only available at the weekend- rather strange for the height of the summer tourist season!
The hotel is rather isolated but has spacious surroundings with well-laid out gardens and grounds. The staff were pleasant and helpful and, all in all, we had an enjoyable stay.",4,2015,08,18
218,Post holiday recouperation,"Having just come back from a family holiday we decided to recharge the batteries before going back to the office and a pile of files.

I was a bit apprehensive about how close the Hotel was to Naas but was delighted when it lived up to the website and was a beautiful hotel with plenty of countryside in and around.

We were late checking in and the Bar/Restaurant manager was very accomodating as were the waiting staff and chef who had all but closed for the night!

Our meal and our wines were delicious and as we began to unwind a live music act started to play in the bar...

It was a fabulous evening and the live entertainment made a nice comfortable hotel bar even better.

The next morning it appeared we weren't the only couple cutting it tight on the breakfast service deadline. The staff were cool calm and collected and we were seated and eating within minutes.

The drive home was all the more relaxing after having spent the night in Killashee.

For our next trip to Dublin Killashee looks like it's going to be our base camp. 

We had a great time and thanks to all the staff for being so helpful.

P.s. go for the superior room!",5,2015,08,18

The reception area is fabulous and the staff efficient but very courteous.  We could not fault our stay in the hotel - vast, comfortable rooms, fabulous food and drink and warm, friendly staff.  The hotel was extremely child- friendly and welcomed little visitors.  We also had a free access to the leisure facilities at the hotel.",5,2015,08,17
218,Afternoon tea at Killashee Hotel.,"This was my second time to do afternoon tea here. It was my mam and her Sisters birthdays. What a first class experience. From start to finish we were treated with such professionalism and real genuine people who love what they do. Sandwiches, cakes and selection of teas along with Prosseco and strawberries was just mouth watering and delicious. The team we had was Daniel and Sarah. They really made our day thank you so much. Cant wait to go back:)",5,2015,08,16
218,Afternoon Tea,Spent a lovely afternoon in Kilashee House Hotel with my wife for afternoon tea for her birthday.  Daniel and his team were more than welcoming. Great  surroundings in Turners restaurant. The food was amazing. Sandwiches were very teasty with a great selection of teas to choose from (coffee was also and option). The scones and selection of deserts were all so delicious.  Will definitely be back for round two shortly.  ,5,2015,08,16
218,"Wonderful killashee,wonderful Stephanie","This is a most beautiful hotel with a great restaurant.  Driving up the lane from the entrance is breathtaking. The building is beautiful and you know you are entering something special.  The gardens are beautiful, and our little granddaughter could safely wander and throw coins in the old fountain.
Going inside you are not disappointed.  A beautiful interior which is very calming. 
My daughter introduced me to this hotel. She knew I would love it.   The first time I ate in the restaurant with my daughter and my husband,  my order, which had been taken by a new member of staff was wrong. The young woman who brought it, was  an established member of staff,  her name was Stephanie, and she couldn't have been nicer or more obliging.    When I told her, she didn't question it, but apologised unreservedly.  She took it and gave me the menu, while all the time apologising for the error. She took my new order and then brought me a large glass of red wine.    This young woman is a great asset to this hotel.  She reinforced the great experience of visiting this lovely hotel.  Needless to say, every time we visit our daughter in Kildare, we eat at killashee hotel and are never disappointed.",5,2015,08,16
218,Extremely Disappointing,"We recently stayed in Killashee House Hotel and were extremely disappointed with our overall experience and we will not be returning. 
The initial impression of the Hotel as we drove up was very positive as the outside of the hotel and the gardens are very well maintained. This statement is also true of the reception area.
We had a short wait to check in which was positive as we have two small children. On check in the receptionist was clearly very busy and checked us in very efficiently however with no personal touch or added information about the hotel. We made a number of enquires about the pool and dinner as nothing was forthcoming and we felt as if our questions were somewhat of an inconvenience.We were instructed to go around the corner to the lift as our room was in the Graydon Wing of the hotel. This is where the experience really deteriorated! The receptionist did not advise that there is quite a trek to the room and that a second lift is required and that the lift is extremely old! We had to get out and in twice to allow it to work correctly! With baggage and small children this is not a good way to start your stay. On exiting the lift we navigated our way around at least two trolleys containing towels or linens which appeared to have been abandoned in the hallway. When we finally arrived at our room we were very disappointed as the room had a fair amount of wear and tear and the bath was not clean.
We resolved to make the best of the situation and decided to go to the Pool. The trek to to the Leisure Centre did nothing to alleviate our opinion of the hotel as our journey led us to a door that opened onto the carpark, which we had to take our children across in order to access the leisure centre. Please be aware that there is no pedestrian walkway to the Leisure Centre from the Hotel and cars are speeding in and out of spaces which is very dangerous.
The welcome from the receptionist at the Leisure Centre was frosty to say the least. I made enquires about the children and towels etc and was greeted with a sigh. We were provided with towels and keys for the locker, I was told ""towels in the hamper, keys to me"", when no further information was forthcoming I assume I had been dismissed and went to the changing area.
The pool facilities are fine - however with many aspects of this hotel it has lost it's overall polish and subject to a lot of wear and tear.
Once again the walk back from the Leisure Centre to the room was not ideal and I really feel this should be addressed by the Hotel Management.
On walking back to our room I also noticed that all the emergency exits are continuously open and appear to be used frequently. This is also concerning from a security perspective.
We had booked Dinner in the Bistro and although it was busy the food and staff were very good and we had a lovely evening.
We made our way back to the room and on entering we could not believe the loud music. We contacted reception who were surprised to hear that were were not with ""The Wedding"" and that between the Band and the DJ there would be music until 2.am! I requested if anything could be done and she advised that  a room across the hall was available and this was much quieter. To be fair the keys of the new room were delivered to our door within 5 minutes - and then we began moving our luggage across the hall. Finally at approximately 22:00pm we were all settled. At this point we agreed that we were going to check out the next day as the hotel had let us down continuously and we were more relaxed at home!
The following morning we were woken at 6am to the sound of delivery trucks and trolleys moving around outside. At this stage we just smiled and decided to have breakfast and check out as quickly as possible.
When we arrived for Breakfast we were shown to a table for 3! with three chairs while the waitress took some cutlery and a cup and saucer from the table of 4 behind us. I stood waiting for a chair while another waitress walked around behind us! On returning with coffee the waitress provided the chair from the table behind us - I have no idea why this happened but the experience was so bad we just sat in disbelief.
After breakfast I checked out of the hotel and dealt with a very pleasant receptionist who was anxious to know why we were leaving early and did try her best to convince me to talk to a manager. I declined as I didn't want the platitudes and excuses that come with making a formal complaint - I just wanted to go home. 
Overall the stay at Killashee House Hotel was extremely disappointing, the Hotel maintains the 4 star appearance to a certain degree but it's almost as if a management decision has been made to maintain the lower floors or certain areas of the hotel to a different level. 
This Hotel feels like a corporation with very good administration, however lacks genuine warmth and hospitality.",1,2015,08,16
218,Great hotel,"This hotel has a quaint and rustic charm that makes it an ideal destination for holiday makers. The hotel is really well maintained and the food was great, this combined with the professionalism of staff and the beautiful setting ensured that we had a very relaxing break. Our 4 year old availed of the free kids club each morning and she loved it.",5,2015,08,15
218,Afternoon tea at Killashee Hotel,"I went to the Killashee Hotel for Afternoon Tea for the second time - this time it was a birthday present for my friend. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed it, Sarah, who served us a variety of different delicious teas, sandwiches and cakes, was lovely and the setting is absolutely gorgeous, with a view of the Hotel Gardens. Will definitely be back again!",5,2015,08,14
218,Spa and lunch,A lovely morning spent in the Killashee spa.  All the staff were most pleasant and helpful. The spa itself is as good as any I have been to (except The Banyan Tree in the U.A.E. which is in a class of its own!)   The treatments were good and the surroundings very relaxing.   Lunch in the hotel was a very pleasant surprise - the best seafood chowder ever and again extremely pleasant staff.  The new owners are obviously making a difference for the better.,5,2015,08,13
218,Wedding season hits Ireland,"Was privileged enough to a Bridesmaid for cousin here. The setting is just beautiful and spectacular! There is a real sense of communication and very good customer service here. They couldn't do enough for us as the Bridal party, and it is big enough to have welcome drinks and then the wedding breakfast in 2 separate areas. The grounds are stunning!! Best photos here. Definitely a place to consider if you are looking for a venue. ",5,2015,08,12
218,I had higher expectation," This hotel did not exceed my expectations i had expected for this hotel :)main building really nice.i wasnt impressed that i booked a midweek spa package which i was ment to be eating in turners restaurent which i wasnt informed on check in that the restaurent was closed. And we ended up eating in the bar both nights which if i was imformed properly on check in we wudnt have minded but we could have went somewhere different one off the nights for dinner.1st night in bar wrong starter came to me and the second night they ran out off spuds.silly things that shudnt happen in 4 star hotel i feel. As for breakfast what irish hotel only serves smoked bacon and no regular bacon.something they definatly shud consider changing .",2,2015,08,11
218,Such a fabulous place ,"Stayed here for a friend's wedding. We stayed in the tower room in the original house it was up a lot of stairs but we'll worth the trek. Room was huge and overlooked emmas butterfly garden. Bathroom had its own stand along bath and great shower. I also got to see a lot of the other room in the house and they were all fab too. The staff were all so nice everyone of them even just saying hello as u walk pass in the halls. They all would go out of the way for anyone. I was a bit disappointed that the spa was booked out on the Monday but that's my own failt for not booking earlyer. The only flaw I had with the weekend is that I had a young baby with me and they didn't have anything for me to keep milk cold and then heat his bottles, but everyone made the most efforts to accommodate that for me if it was room service of warm milk, to a pot of hot water and fresh milk to let it go old school heating. All round loved it had a brilliant time and will be back again. Wish I had of taken more photos of my room. ",5,2015,08,08
218,Afternoon Tea,"Unfortunately a real disappointment! 
Open sandwiches very set and coated on plate, definetly not freshly made. 1 stand of  tasteful desserts but between 3 people, very poor at price of €30 pp! 
Waitress apologised and said an error was made and brought a second stand?? 
Sat at a table , facing numerous high chairs and random chairs shoved into a corner, very poor! 

It was a special celebration and when asked nicely to leave at 5.31 pm, to facilitate dinner service, I felt this was an unnecessary request  , it was not at all busy and was disqusted really ! 

I should have complained but as it was a family celebration, I wished not to.
I have not recommended this afternoon tea service since and will not be returning! No value for money , very poor service on waitress behalf! Too many negatives !",2,2015,08,05
218,Slightly disappointed,"Stayed here last night for one night.  First impressions of the building beautiful  Went into Bistro Bar and very busy but hey it is a Sunday lunch time. Thats expected. Room wasnt ready, this was 3.00 pm. Had some lunch which was fine.  Got to room but was disappointed with it. We had booked a Superior room..... I would't have liked to have seen the standard room!.  Didnt look like floor in bathroom had been washed, splash marks and bit poor in general.  Decor was bit dated I thought... Our room was up hill and down dale also. Glad I  didn't have any mobility problems.  Had dinner in the Turner Restaurant which was ok. Overall would not give this a 4 star rating.",3,2015,08,03
218,Highly recommend ,"My husband and I spent 2 nights in this wonderful hotel - staff in every area were exceptional , most helpful and pleasant . Service superb , breakfast was amazing - would definitely return again if in that area and would love to visit the spa next time ",5,2015,08,02
218,former convent and boarding school now a country house hotel,"Like many good hotels, the best asset that the Killashee can boast of is its staff who are extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are quite large and well appointed ad full of character. The property sits on extensive grounds and has a nice long driveway up to it. A great place to spend a relaxing few days.",5,2015,07,26
218,First Class Hotel,"My husband and I stayed in Killashee House for three nights in July and from the moment we arrived we experienced excellent service.  All staff we encountered were extremely efficient and friendly. We arrived early but staff on reception got us checked into our room within an hour even though the hotel was very busy.  The room was very spacious and comfortable as was the bathroom which had a good powerful shower.  The only thing the room didn't have was a fridge.  The hotel and the grounds are just beautiful.  We ate in the hotel all three nights and the food is excellent as are the staff both in the Bistro and Restaurant.  
We look forward to returning.",5,2015,07,25
218,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed here with my husband and three children (ages 7, 4 & 1).  On arrival, the foyer was buzzing - a rugby team were getting group photos and lots of families were arriving to check in.  Lots of space for children to run around and not annoy anyone.
Rooms were great, lovely bathroom. 
Pool was in building separate to hotel - this was only negative as meant children walking back to hotel with wet hair, weather was fine for us but not during cold Irish winter.  Great pool.
Had dinner in restaurant - delicious but very slow.  Staff were very accommodating and we ate our dessert in the foyer.
Breakfast was fabulous, served in the restaurant with sun shining in.  Every type of food - excellent.
We also took a walk around the butterfly garden and the hotel gardens behind the main building - gorgeous!  We also visited the Irish National Stud which is a great family day out and very close by.
Good WIFI.
A really great hotel, will return again.",5,2015,07,22
218,anniversary delight,"My wife and i stayed for 2 nights and the staff could not have been more helpful and the room was excellent,and the food was top shelf,i would highly recommend this hotel great spot. TERRY-( DROGHEDA)
      
      ",4,2015,07,21
218,underwhelmed and disappointing,"I had high expectations for the visit in July but was sadly disappointed.

Pros:
Fantastic decor, the hotel, grounds and rooms look very well, the splendour is eye catching. 
The space in rooms, very large.
Helpful reception staff
Good breakfast in dining room

Cons
Bar/Restaurant very disappointing. Waited for ages for feed. The food was bland to say the least. Partner got a thai curry. Tasted like a microwave ready male. I got steak with peppered sauce, sauce tasted like a tube of vinegar had been added.

I thought cleaners were a bit loud, maybe it was just me.

We had a standard room. Shower was a bit weak, either roasting or freezing. Beds had weird dark stains on bottom of sheets, almost like footprints when we arrived.
Furniture in room a bit outdated.

The hotel is rural, so taxis are expensive coming in and out. We paid €35 for a taxi one of the nights. Rip off. A hotel this size should have a phone in place in house for guests to use at discounted rates like most modern hotels.

The spa is expensive, £20 for 'thermal' pool when standard pool is free.

The food, and cleaners (personal observation) was what annoyed me the most. €200 for a 2 night stay to have very bad and expensive food was a huge let down.

Not sure if I will be back to be honest.",2,2015,07,21
218,Potentially Disastrous visit to Killashee Spa brilliantly dealt with,"My parter had booked a beautiful treatment in Kilashee Spa for the two of us for my birthday.  My partner got her treatment and said it was just fantastic.

Due to an error on the part of a member of staff, I ended up not getting my treatment and being ""forgotten about"" in a room for almost an hour.

Sharon, the manager, dealt with the situation brilliantly and went above and beyond to rectify the situation.  She was efficient and extremely courteous.  We really cannot praise her enough.  She really did ensure that we left feeling very happy with Killashee, even with the problems.

The Spa itself is beautiful.  The whole place is very clean and well maintained.  You are provided with everything you need.  It exudes luxury and relaxation.  

I would highly recommend it.  The only, very minor issue, is that there is ivy overgrown at the front of the building and it can make it difficult to see the sign.",5,2015,07,21
218,Pleasant stay,"We were staying here as we were attending a convention in Citywest. The hotel is a big old convent (I think) with two wings built on. The grounds are lovely and the hotel is clean and well run. The public areas are spacious and well decorated although the way to Reception through the Bistro is rather odd, The bedrooms are large and comfortable ;our bedroom had no A/C which was not a problem this summer but could be during a warmer summer. The staff were pleasant and helpful; dinner was lovely in a beautiful restaurant. Because of our convention breakfast was put on earlier than usual for which we were very grateful. The variety of goodies for breakfast was excellent and very tempting. The swimming pool is quite a way from the hotel which on a rainy day would be awkward. One more small thing, there was a wedding on the Saturday evening so all our party were put in rooms away from the festivities and any potential overnight noise for which I'd like to say Thank you! We would certainly stay here again.",4,2015,07,21
218,very plush,"Stayed here before a conference, lovely big room quite funny getting a twin room with two double beds for a single occupant! The food and serve at Jack's Bar was great. Breakfast was excellent and served in a nice bright room overlooking the garden. Conference facilities were very good as was the lunch provided on the day.",5,2015,07,20
218,Beautiful Hotel - Very Poor Service,"Stayed for 2 nights with elderly parents last week. The hotel was really nice with both hotel and gardens kept to a very high standard. The service in the bar was dreadful. Plenty of staff but no management and little or no training. Staff at breakfast and in the bar seemed to be very pleasant as they were constantly huddled in groups chatting while customers were waiting on food and drink service - when it would arrive it would be either wrong or would come down on the double - The waste of breakfasts and drinks at the bar was atrocious with incorrect or double orders. I don't blame the staff  they are not being trained and it is a bad trait creeping into hotels, bars and restaurants throughout the country.",3,2015,07,20
218,fantastic,"really enjoyed our special night here and want to thank all the staff and especially the eastern european girl who upgraded our room.Gymnasium is an added gem that we were unaware of when booking,cant wait to return",5,2015,07,19
218,Wedding service,"Iv never been to the Killashee before but it was a lovely experience it had class and eligance. The service we recieved was next to nothing. From the delightful food bursting with flavour to the steady constanct flow of alcohol. My partner and me were not sure if we had made the right decision on location for our wedding but after being here we are certain its the place for us. I would like to thank a lovely young man Dione for the way he took care of me on the floor service very patient while i made my decision, he was quick to help and smiling while doing it from my fience and me thank you for a memorable day and on our memorable day we would like you there again.",5,2015,07,18
218,Perfect Break,"We were fortunate to get a room upgrade when we arrived to a suite in the main house and it was a jaw dropper & we were obviously chuffed. 

From the moment we checked in to the moment we left the Hotel, the staff, food and amenities were all equally top class and I would not hesitate to go back. 

Job well done Killashee House Hotel :)",5,2015,07,17
218,Fantastic location poor service,"Beautiful hotel, decent rooms with fantastic gardens. 

However; 

-Food was cold at breakfast and evening meal
-service in jack bar was terrible served the wrong thing four different times and forgot to bring our drinks. 
-we had to wait 1hr to get our room when we arrived (to after 4 pm), second day came back to the room not serviced until after 5, third day we had to ask to get it serviced.
- same menu in restaurant as in the bar, menu had little selection and did not change - we left on both days and went to naas. 

Unfortunately we won't be coming back and would not recommend it to others ",2,2015,07,14
218,Disappointing return trip,"Having spent a fantastic few days over Easter this year we were eagerly anticipating a return visit! However, poor service at dinner in the bistro & at breakfast spoiled our return visit. Killashee House is a beautiful hotel in wonderful surroundings. The rooms are beautifully decorated & spacious (if a little warm at night). The food is of a high standard but having to wait an hour for a main course in the bistro is disappointing. At breakfast we had to ask for coffee twice & we are still waiting to be asked for our breakfast order. We reported these concerns at reception & were told a manager would be in contact. We are awaiting his response. ",2,2015,07,14
218,Fantastic comfortable family friendly hotel,"My family and I stayed in this hotel while attending a conference In the Citywest Conference Centre. We stayed for 4 nights (Thurs - Sun incl.) and absolutely loved it.

We booked a family room which had 2 double beds in it, and it was very spacious and airy. The beds were very comfortable, and the facilities in the room were good. The bathroom was slightly larger than average for a hotel, and the room's layout meant that it didn't feel cramped, even with 2 adults and 2 small children in it.

The staff were genuinely friendly and accommodating, providing a fan when requested and arranging an early breakfast on the Sunday. They also went out of their way to make the children feel welcome, with nice little touches like colouring in sheets in the bistro to keep them occupied while we waited for our food. There was also a kids cinema evening put on for children in the hotel. All the staff interacted with the children, and at no time were we made to feel uncomfortable for bringing small children to a somewhat upmarket hotel, which we have felt on other occasions in other hotels.

The food in Jack's Bistro was excellent. We had a 4 course meal on one of the nights, and ordered room service on another night, and on both occasions the quality of the food was excellent, and it was presented beautifully. It was a nice touch that the children received their own menu, and it was not just the usual nuggets and chips kids fare, bangers and mash and pizza went down very well!

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely try to come back to enjoy the other amenities the hotel had to offer, but which we simply did not have the time to sample this time round. 

Thank you Killashee House Hotel, and we will be back!",5,2015,07,14
218,Beautful Gardens,"Hotel has a beautiful drive leading up to the entrance. The room was large and spacious, although a bit weird to get to. A lift to the 2nd/3rd floor and then a lift back down. Once you got the hang of it it was easy enough to find. Comfy beds.

The breakfast was ok and definitely room for improvement (signs for hot food by end of breakfast serving was all messed up with beans, etc and looked quite clumsy). One cold meat with few pieces of cheddar. Would have preferred a better cold meat and cheese section. 

The hotel's gardens are beautiful and lovely to sit in if the weather is good. Spa was also nice and clean. Check out was poor, no eye contact, no asking how the stay was, no wishing you well, quite unfriendly etc. A shame, as that is the last thought you leave the hotel with.",4,2015,07,11
218,Lovely Place,Second visit to Killashee. Absolutely lovely.  Afternoon tea is a must and so tasty. The staff that waited on us for the tea we so nice. The rooms are exquisite and luxurious.  Can't wait to go again. The pool is brilliant for the kids although I found it a tad cooler than my own local pool.,4,2015,07,11
218,Superb hotel,Stayed for two midweek nights with my wife and two young children. Spacious clean comfortable and very interesting rooms. Staff genuinely friendly and great with kids. We ate in the bistro both nights and both the food and service were excellent. Great to be able to walk kids around the beautiful gardens after dinner to release some of their energy. Did not get as far as the pool etc to review but will next time. Breakfast was excellent quality in architecturally beautiful surroundings - again the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. The checkout was among the smoothest I have experienced. I cannot think of any negatives. Overall we had a great stay and will be back.,5,2015,07,11
218,Lovely family hotel,My kids absolutely loved this hotel. They want loved the breakfast buffet and the afternoon tea and can't stop talking about it. They keep asking us to take them back. What a great sign as kids are your most honest guests!,4,2015,07,10
218,lovely hotel,"enjoyed our stay.staff were friendly, rooms clean. nice grounds around the hotel, Naas is just a few mins away if needed . there is a fantastic spa in the hotel and it was a very relaxing atmosphere. restaurant was lovely, great stay",4,2015,07,10
218,Heavenly afternoon tea,"Spent a lovely afternoon with friends having tea, cakes, mini sandwiches and prosecco. There was just enough for each of us. We must have sat there for 3 hours chatting and enjoying the jovial atmosphere of the tea room. Afterwards we went to the main hotel bar and enjoyed some live music. The hotel decor is very nice, and staff were helpful and accommodating. Looking forward to our next visit.",4,2015,07,08
218,Celebrated our 25 Years married....................,Just back after short break.........excellent service all round especially Stephanie in the bar............very attentive...........great breakfast..............big 4 poster bed in room which was very spacious............... hope to return again some day.............,5,2015,07,08
218,Beautiful setting and gardens,"Superb location and service. Apparently this used to be a convent but it has been renovated to a high but tasteful standard. Our room was huge, overlooking the gardens.
There were two double beds, e suite and all the usual amenities. Everything was spotless and the service was superb. Nothing was too much trouble. For a short stay 
You can't go wrong",5,2015,07,07
218,Super staff,"House and gardens are as picturesque as you'd expect and the room was great- good size, comfy bed, great shower and all the bits and pieces you need.

Highlight of the stay was without a doubt the staff. So helpful and friendly without delivering any kind of robotic customer service. A really friendly, personable atmosphere and great to see staff getting on really well among themselves. Right from when we arrived late on and they made sure we could get some hot food (service had closed at this point) to leaving at 5am to catch a flight (after a friendly wake-up call and tasty breakfast brought to our room)- the whole team here (reception, bar, waiting, room servicing- the lot of 'em) made our stay relaxed and enjoyable. Couldn't ask for more from them. Thank you!",5,2015,07,06
218,"Fantastic weekend - spa, relaxation, great service","Stayed for a fab weekend in Killashee, got a great spa deal.  Spa treatments excellent, hydrotheraphy pool great.  Hotels, gardens, relaxation areas all brilliant.  Love the Debra Ireland butterfly garden, so pretty.  Dinner on Saturday evening, fabulous food, fantastic service.  Highly recommend this hotel, we were on a girls spa break but seems good for weddings and family also.  We'll definitely be back again, doing a great job Killashee staff.",5,2015,07,06
218,Great weekend,"Really lovely place to stay, spa excellent both decor and treatments, food amazing, especially deserts, music in bar brilliant, no disruption from large wedding in function room. Bedroom large and airy for 3 people. Barman could have done with a little extra help as service was slow.",5,2015,07,05
218,Business Trip,"This was a nice hotel, quiet, clean and out of the way.
Bit of a trek from room to restaurant, but hey so what, we all need a bit of excercise!
Front of house staff/bar very pleasant as were the behind the scene staff. 
All in all, look forward to a return trip in the not too distant future.",4,2015,07,04
218,business,Great hotel great food and excellent service. The grounds are very well maintained. Top hotel would recommend if in Kildare area then this is the place to stay. Best breakfast in a long time.Looking forward to next visit.,5,2015,07,01
218,Friendly bar Staff,"attended as part of a herbalife convention last weekend lovely room excellent stay but most pleasing was the service from the staff especially the barstaff who looked after us well for the night from our champagne on arrival to never having to leave my seat all night for a drink and even provided music for us when our dj finished early and were great fun and eager to keep our night going for us 

ill def make a weekend of it next time",5,2015,06,30
218,lunch experience,"i had lunch here recently with a very large group It is in a beautiful setting and is very well staffed,
THe food was okay i had a cesar salad to start and found it uninspiring and had the chicken for main course which was tasty if a trifle dry on top as if it had been sitting under heat but the sauce was good. Dessert was the best feature with a mixed plate . Coffee was awful so overall an okay meal cant say as i would be rushing back Staff were attentive but did bring warm white wine to our table",4,2015,06,30
218,Enjoyed our Stay,"Stayed with friends for one night, booked a triple room and was expecting 3 single beds for 3 adults. The room had 2 double beds and one tiny roll out bed! I wasn't told this is what we would be getting, rang reception and a short while after the manager offered us the room at a double bedroom rate which was fine as 2 of us were ok to share a bed...but be warned if you're booking a triple room! We went to the bar for food, ordered and got a starter to share, 1 hour later no mains! Asked 3 different times and were told food was on the way etc, everyone around us who had arrived in later had their food. Asked a 4th time and were told it was on way and we'd be given desserts on the house. We waited 1hr 15 mins for our main but the food was really good and we really enjoyed. Bar was very lively and had a music. Breakfast was good but again the service was slow and the Q to be seated when we were leaving at 1130 was very very long! Waiting staff in the bar and breakfast room seemed to be under pressure so perhaps the hotel is short staffed. The hotel is really lovely though, very clean and the rooms are excellent...plenty of space. Would recommend and would stay again.",4,2015,06,30
218,Stand out staff performance - Paola & Joe ,"I have recently returned back from a business conference from Killashee House  Hotel and felt compelled to write about two outstanding staff  members! 

Im not one to dish out compliments readily unless some one goes the extra mile and i certainly  dont review these  things  on TripAdvisor  - this  is my first ever TripAdvisor review!

Paola the girl on front of house in the main restaurant gave exceptional service throughout  the duration  of our stay. No job too big or too small for her - from us demanding bunch...and always, ALWAYS  with a warm welcoming smile on her face. I was extremely  impressed by her professionalism and decorum. I would hire her any  day!

Joe the Food & Beverage manager also gave another standout  performance  - again acting  on our high demands with a calming , personable and professional  approach.  

Paola and Joe  are  an absolute  credit to Killashee House Hotel and Killashee are LUCKY to have them.

They are an asset to Killashee and helped to restore a lot  of faith  which started to dwindle on our first day at our company event - due to not getting off to a great start  in regards to slow service  in day one of our conference. 
But Paola & Joe helped to give us a great lasting impression of Killashee! 

What ever you do - dont evet let them go! 

",5,2015,06,28
218,Great Stay,"Stayed here for our Global Conference and it was superb... Staff were very friendly and helpful with everything... Room was great and beautiful gardens... One constructive feed back would be to review the menus and food in the kitchen for lunches... 

Well done and thank you...",4,2015,06,26
218,Excellent,I bring my toddler swimming here at the weekend and I must say that I am impressed with the set up. The changing rooms are spacious and there is both a big pool and a kiddies pool which are heated. There is also a jacuzzi and sauna available in the pool area. The gym is well equipped with a good selection of machines and is always quiet when we are there albeit that is usually first thing on a Sunday morning. ,4,2015,06,22
218,A sham.,"Went there on a Saturday night with my wife to turners resteraunt.
The decor and room was very nice with nice furniture and we'll turned out staff all looked very upmarket and we were really expecting a delicious meal to match the fancy dining room.
That's where we were wrong , the meal was cheap and nasty like a bad carvery hospital or factory canteen food would be much the same if not better.
The meat on the main course was not cooked freshly and had the texture of reheated meat or meat that was cooked hours ago and kept warm , the veg which was meant to be carrots , broccoli and peas consisted of about 10 peas 2 small pieces of broccoli and a bag of carrots which appeared to have been cooked whole and someone forgot to cut them up into bite sized pieces or more like the veg was whatever was left in the bottom of the pot !
The starters which were prawns and salad with sauces which I have to say tasted so much like tomato ketchup and mayonnaise would have been nice at home or in a cafe , but the way they were worded in the menu I tought that the dish would have been worthy of masterchef or a dish by Gordon Ramsey or someone like that .
To tell the truth the meal was laughable.
We complained but the lady at front of house was so stressed with complaints from the tables around us that we said we would give her a break.
Besides we were entertained by the grandiose descriptions on the menu and then to get a dish that you could cook at home was quiet funny.
Anyway save your money have a night in and order a takeaway just write out a fancy menu beforehand to give your self the same effect of eating in turners resteraunt.",2,2015,06,16
218,Terrific meal,"We had a Family Party Meal for a 70th Birthday on May 29th at Jack's Bistro and it was just great.  Super atmosphere, lovely staff and good table location.   The Food was excellent and everyone enjoyed themselves on the night. Full marks!",5,2015,06,15
218,Lovely relaxing Weekend break,"Stayed for a weekend recently with my husband. It is very much a wedding hotel but this did not interfere with our own experience as the hotel is so large the wedding doesn't really interfere with the leisure guests.
Had dinner in the main restaurant on Saturday which was really nicely presented but the food itself was a bit bland. Hit and miss with the service. We ate in the bar on the Sunday evening.....great menu and food was very tasty.
Great facilities in the leisure centre only down side it's in a separate building to the hotel so if it's raining/cold not ideal running across car park in your robe/slippers.
Had a spa treatment and while the treatment is fab the whole spa in need of a revamp.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and we had a great value deal but probably will not return again.",4,2015,06,15
218,Lovely Hotal but Disappointing Service,"Attended a wedding in Killashee yesterday. The check in was great, the young man was very friendly and polite but service quality dropped from here. The waitresses at the wedding meal didn't look like they wanted to be working, not one smile from any of them, plates ""slapped"" on the table but my biggest complaint came when after buying a bottle of white wine I asked a young waitress if I could get an ice bucket for it, was told I'd have to ask the barman. Went to the bar, where the 1st barman was unsure if they had any so checked with a 2nd barman to be informed no they didn't have any!!!",3,2015,06,13
218,Lovely hotel with amazing spa and gorgeous grounds!!,"I stayed in Killashee this weekend and had such a lovely time! It's in a great location to visit dublin,kildare,naas and loads more! There is so much to do!
The hotel itself is great, very clean it is obvious the maintenance is well kept! The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous, we were lucky to stay when the sun was shining, which made the garden even more beautiful!
We didn't have dinner while we were there but we did have breakfast and it was very good, the staff were very friendly and the breakfast could not be faulted in any way!
The best part of my stay was my spa treatment, I got to use the hydrotherapy pool which was so quiet and peaceful. The spa is one of the nicest I have ever been in, and I am a spa therapist myself so I have been in alot!! The relax room is stunning! I had my treatment with Sinead she was very professional, knew exactly what she was doing, my treatment was definitely 5 star! I was so relaxed leaving, my skin felt super soft and my shoulders felt so much looser!!
I can't wait to come back to Killashee House and especially the Villa Spa! :-) ",5,2015,06,09
218,Cared for extremely well by the gentle people of Kildare.,"From the moment I arrived at the Killashee House Hotel I was made to feel very welcome by all the hotel staff from the team at reception to the housekeeping staff. The restaurant, the bar and the residents bar were run by the most wonderful thoughtful people. Yes there was the odd insignificant adjustment that needed to be made which was done quickly, efficiently and without fuss. As a professional event manager of twenty-five years, this haven and more importantly the people that work there made my job easier and a lot less stressful.

At times I felt like I was residing in Neverland and certainly did not want to leave.

The nearby village of Naas has some excellent shops stocking Oxford Street brands and bars again like the good people at the Killahee House, those I met were patient, kind and helpful. All appear to possess the kind of gentle nature that one surely must only find in places much higher than where we dwell today.

I will be going back to this place. With local racecourses like the Curragh, Leopardstown and Naas, villages like Kilcullen and the very excellent Fallons restaurant, Kildangan Stud who welcomed us like returning friends, This is an easy choice.

The next time this soul is at the Killashee I will be asking for a room with a room door latch which can be locked from the inside when going to bed. Hopefully this will stop a body from mistaking the room door for the toilet door in the early hours when going for a pee. Not an uncommon occurrence I am assured. 

Thank you to all that worked with me in particular Laura (hope your knee is better), Louise at reception who is always calm and smiling. And a great big thank you to Frank and his amazing Killashee time machine.

218,Great service,"Stayed overnight for a wedding. Staff terrific. Rooms ideal. Food excellent. Lift situation a bit confusing, especially if your room no. begins with  1 but not enough to spoil stay. Bar prices reasonably priced.",4,2015,06,09
218,Surprisingly disappointed!!,"We stayed the Sunday night of the June bank holiday in a junior suite. Although it was a junior suite, it was very grubby, it needs a freshen up, peeling wallpaper and marks on the walls both in the bedroom and bathroom. 
We visited the leisure centre and the facilities are superb. Two jacuzzis and a full size swimming pool are rare to be seen in a hotel leisure centre. 
We had dinner booked that night in the bistro restaurant as part of our package. We went down early for a drink before dinner and all I can say is that it was the most unorganised bar I have ever seen. The staff had no idea what they were doing. I witnessed staff bringing the wrong drinks to tables numerous times, even to our own table. They weren't even that busy that they were overwhelmed. 
Thankfully we were upgraded to the Turners restaurant and all I can say is it was fabulous, one of the nicest restaurants we have are in a long time. 
Overall it was a pleasant experience but not what I expected for a 4 star hotel. ",4,2015,06,05
218,Great weekend ,We are just back from a lovely weekend with our children. The staff were lovely. Very helpful and family friendly. The bar and restaurant were great. The kids loved the pool. There is a lovely lounge area upstairs. A really lovely hotel with great character. Bedrooms nice and spacious. Gardens lovely. I will definitely go back.,5,2015,06,03
218,"Pleasant stay, not far from airport","We stayed for one night on out way back to Dublin airport. The room was spacious and quiet, despite there being two wedding parties in the hotel we were not disturbed. Very comfortable beds. Rooms have tea-making facilities and heating, no airconditioning (but it is Ireland!). Some bumps and scratches on the furniture suggest that it's probably time for a refresh.
The main restaurant, ""Turners"", isn't perhaps as fancy as it thinks it is, but the menu was good value, the food very good (and copious) and the staff very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was a generous buffet, with several cooked options as well.
The bar is modern, with a couple of TVs and live music, but there are quieter areas to sit. The gardens looked pleasant, but the combination of wedding photographs and rain limited our chance to explore.
Not a place for a small romantic getaway, but as large country hotels go it does what it does very well. Takes about 45 minutes to drive to the airport (on a Sunday morning).",3,2015,06,02
218,mid week break,"Went for a 3 week break and found the hotel just average with need for some refurbishment.
The room we had was very nice with a very big comfy bed and well equipped bathroom.
Food is good but quite a limited menu.
Unfortunately other things were disappointing.
The Snug bar only opens at weekends so there are limited places to relax in.
The biggest let down was breakfast as first day we were served a very under cooked 
poached egg. Found it difficult to get the attention of staff. On our last day after 20 minutes waiting for a boiled egg we were told it be a few more minutes but left after a further 5 minutes.
Should point out that staff in the bistro are very good and also reception.",3,2015,06,02
218,Birthday,"Excellent stay we booked the hotel for a birthday party ,it was excellent staff were great. Ten adults and five children lovely rooms we enjoyed a very good dinner also breakfast the next morning lovely walk in the gardens very comfortable beds it was a nice find on line I haven't heard about it before so well done ",5,2015,06,01
218,Lovely Hotel,Stayed here with Mam and my sister. Stayed in room 123 lovely big room quiet. Just the light on ceiling kept rattling when someone was walking in the room above us. Used the spa was lovely. Used the hydrotherapy suite of an extra charge of 10 euro which we knew about but wouldn't use it again not much in it. Didn't eat here as the menu was poor and very expensive,4,2015,06,01
218,Customer service found to be lacking,"I visited Killashee Hotel recently for a wedding reception and was very disappointed with the service. The starter of the meal was duck spring roll with some salad. Having eaten the spring roll I then tried the salad to find an insect about an inch long flapping its wings under the lettuce. I called the manager to the table, who apologised and asked for my room number.

The next morning at breakfast my husband ordered a full Irish breakfast with unsmoked rashers. The waitress said this would be no problem, and went to place the order. The breakfast was served with no rashers. We called over the waitress, who then went to ask the kitchen and told us they do not stock unsmoked rashers.

I mentioned these two instances to reception when checking out, and I was told a manager would call me to follow up with us. We received no phone call from the hotel.

I called the hotel myself later that evening and spoke to a manager who had just come on duty. He did apologise, and mentioned there was a note on our account to check that we were okay the next morning. The manager mentioned that it was normal for a round of drinks to be bought for the table if this happened. I am wondering does this happen frequently?

I understand that things go wrong in the hustle and bustle of a hotel. That’s not my complaint. My problem is with how these issues were handled. At no point did we feel the issues were handled seriously enough. Apologies aren’t half as effective if you have to call looking for them.",3,2015,06,01
218,Stunning public areas and massive family suite,"Absolute gem in the Kildare countryside.  Food, accommodation and hotel all top rank.  Jacks bar is about as traditional as it gets.

Everywhere is family friendly and breakfast is crazy good. 

Beautiful hotel with amazing gardens.",5,2015,05,27
218,mini moon,"beautful hotel, frendly staff, room service was nice, if you want a treatment in the spa book in advance. afternoon tea is a must. the bar food was nice and breakfast was very filling orderd it to the room for a small extra well worth it.",5,2015,05,27
218,"Very nice location, beautiful gardens","The staff were very friendly, and we had a nice big double room, also the food was excellent. I used the leisure facilities and the hotel has a spa as well. This hotel is very big and spacious, as it was a Convent years ago, and has been completely refurbished.",5,2015,05,26
218,Gorgeous country house hotel,"Stayed here recently for a wedding. Beautiful venue and setting. Really gorgeous hotel. Gardens are fabulous for walks and for photos. Very good service. Good food but a bit pricey for what you get. Good buffet breakfast. Rooms are fab, good size, tastefully decorated, immaculately clean. Comfy beds. Good size bathrooms with separate shower and bath tub. His and hers sinks. No phone reception in bedrooms, but there is free internet.  Lifts are confusing and it is a big hotel. Lovely big bar. Very nice wedding function room.",5,2015,05,26
218,Beautiful ,"Stayed here for a friend's wedding. It was fabulous. The staff were helpful and friendly. The room and hotel are beautifully decorated. It is set in stunning grounds. The breakfast was delicious. Would recommend it, and would love to stay here again.",4,2015,05,23
218,Perfect stay from start to finish,Beautifully decorated luxurious stately home style hotel with very helpful pleasant staff. Our room was a huge family size with very comfy beds and a beautiful view of the distant mountains. We had an inclusive meal in the casual Jacks restaurant - chosen from the main menu- and the portions were very generous and well presented. Afterwards the bar staff went to great lengths to provide my cocktail request. Breakfast was delicious and cooked to order- the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs were divine. The hotel is huge but immaculately clean and a walk in the gardens is a must! Our stay was for a girlie break but I would definitely return with my husband.,5,2015,05,22
218,Amazing.,"We had our wedding in the killashee on the 22nd April and stayed a second night to continue celebrating. Everything about this venue was amazing, from the world class customer service to the picturesque surroundings we couldn't fault it. There is not a word I could use to highly recommend it enough, so I'll just say 'go there'. You will not regret it.",5,2015,05,21
218,Spa Day with the Girls,The staff were so friendly and could not have been more helpful. Anything we needed in the rooms was sent straight up without delay. The spa treatment were amazing - a perfect place for a girls night away! The gardens were beautiful and perfect for a stroll after dinner. The food in the restaurant was fantastic. It was perfectly timed and didn't feel rushed. I cannot recommend this place enough!,5,2015,05,20
218,Wonderful breakfast in sumptuous surroundings,"One of the best breakfasts I have had in a long long time I have just had in the restaurant in this hotel. Thanks to a recent bad experience in the Keadeen Hotel in Newbridge, I went looking for an alternative and landed in Killashee House Hotel. What a find this was! I had what could only be described as a feast in a large spacious bright, happy dining room, which was doing great business at 8am. There is consideable choice on the menu and, rather than try to describe what was available, I would recommend that you look on the hotel’s website where the breakfast menu is there for all to see: the only thing missing here are peacock’s tongue in aspic! If you are too young to remember this, ask one of your grandparents. There was genuine orange juice (out of actual oranges no less) and fresh fruit, including pineapple. I opted for the home-made pancakes(delicious) and left an hour later, a very happy and sated customer complete with a free copy of the Irish Times. Very courteous and charming staff: the cost, €16.50",5,2015,05,20
218,Over night stay.,"I was recommended this hotel as an overnight stay on a trip to Kinsale. I found the hotel to be all that I had been told. On arrival the reception staff were most helpful and friendly and I was in my room without delay.the room was most beautifully fitted out . The food in the bistro was excellent,again the staff were attentive and friendly.On the morning of departure the breakfast choice was mouthwatering and my choice I found to exceed my expectations.I would certainly like to return to the Killashee  House Hotel but for a longer stay as I did not have enough time to take in the lovely gardens sourinding the Hotel.",4,2015,05,20
218,relaxing,"I've been to Killashee on many occasions, for weddings, lunch, dinner and it never disappoints!!  beautiful grounds, great staff, fab food, spotless!!! The spa and gym are top class and ive become a member because of this! Highly recommend Killashee House Hotel!",5,2015,05,20
218,Nice comfortable hotel with good food,"Have been to a couple of weddings here. One in the smaller room, in the old building and another in the huge function room. Both rooms were really nice, excellent staff, and great food. Would recommend this hotel for weddings.",4,2015,05,19
218,Wedding ,"A close friend of mine was recently married and availed of these fantastic facilities - personally from being a guest,  the experience from the day before the wedding reception to after it was a very thoroughly enjoyable stay. The staff were very helpful, also as a vegetarian I was catered for and there was no hassles where in other stays (elsewhere) it seemed to be a big ordeal.. So thumbs up to the catering staff for facilitating me... 👍I felt very welcomed and so relaxed in the hotel. I made use of the leisure centre too during my stay and the equipment had great variety. I would definitely return and use the facilities & highly recommend it to other friends and work colleagues 😉",4,2015,05,19
218,Family Wedding,"Stayed in the older part of the hotel. The room was gorgeous. Everyone was very well looked after by all of the staff throughout the hotel. There was a guest with food allergies and the staff looked after him very well. The meal was lovely, as was the breakfast the next morning. Would highly recommend for any occasion! ",5,2015,05,19
218,Amazing Hotel and VERY helpful staff,I recently attended a wedding at Killashee House Hotel and it was out of this world. The venue itself is like something out of a postcard and the hotel rooms were amazing. The staff could not do enough for the guests. The food was very nice and the staff were more than happy to deal with the kids fussy orders on the day. I would highly recommend this hotel as a wedding venue or for a weekend stay.,5,2015,05,19
218,De boyz in the kitchen,"The lamb shank? Why, awful - truly awful...
The lamb shank? Why, awful - really bad...
The lamb shank? Why, awful - disgusting!
Yes, I just wanted to eat and get out...
Why couldn't they just dish up what was ordered in the first place?
Spiteful treatment instead........",1,2015,05,17
218,Filthy,"Let me start with the good points - the hotel is situated very close to the lovely town of Naas and has nice grounds. The oldest part of the hotel is a very nice Victorian building. That's where the niceties end. I really feel that a basic requirement of any establishment serving food, drinks and accommodation is cleanliness. The bar and table surfaces were dirty and sticky and this may well have influenced my distaste for the food. Finding a big lump of chewing gum stuck on the underside of our table did not help matters.  The staff didn't seem to care less when I mentioned the less than satisfactory environment. Indeed staff are totally untrained - I asked for a glass of Merlot and was served a white wine! The leisure centre changing rooms were cold and grubby with unbearably hot showers. There is a definite need for proper ventilation. The pool was so backed full of people that it wasn't possible to swim - i felt like I was in Butlins. The bedroom was in need of redecoration, with plenty of dust, particularly under the bed. I really felt we would have been better off staying at home.",1,2015,05,15
218,A most wonderful wedding day,"Our wedding day at Killashee House Hotel was more than I could have wished for.  It was a wonderful, magical day, that moved seamlessly from beginning to end. Contact was through the Wedding department and our wedding coordinator, Noelle, was a pleasure to deal with.  There was great attention to detail and good advice given to us.  Responses to questions were quick and helpful.  Many of our guests were from abroad and we found the staff at the reception, the bar and restaurant helpful and friendly at all times in the days coming up to the wedding and able to resolve any minor details with our guests immediately.  Nothing was a problem.  On the day itself, the Old House looked amazing, in particular the flower displays.  All of our guests had a wonderful day and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  The food was highly praised by all our guests and we had several different nationalities attending and all were happy.  Cillian, the manager on the day, the barmen, waiters and waitresses were friendly and helpful at all times.  We received our wedding photos recently and those taken in the gardens in particular are really lovely.  We would highly recommend Killashee House Hotel for weddings and our thanks to Katie in the Wedding department and all of the staff who contributed to making it such a happy occasion.",5,2015,05,15
218,Spa Break,"Gorgeous Spa and Hotel. Treatments were fabulous and quite reasonably priced. Along with the spa treatments, we had use of the hydro pool which was gorgeous, the perfect way to relax!
Hotel was very clean and staff were great. Would definitely recommend this hotel for people looking for a spa break and will definitely be returning.",5,2015,05,14
218,Mr. McElligott & co,"Tetrarch Capital may be in danger of loosing sight of what is important i.e. the customer who pays for it all. Killashee is in Mr. McElligott's back yard and it deserves attention as I am sure all the other establishments do too.

I stayed recently in Killashee and found that the whole experience was lacking in some respects. The Layout chart at the back of the door in my room showed the escape routes via the two nearby emergency exits. But the recommendation for guests in the 1st floor of the Graydon block is to go up the stairs at one emergency exit whereas the actual signage at that location tells guests to do the opposite i.e. go down.

I ordered rare steak in Jack's Bar and was served overcooked 'medium' steak (sans champignons) for my trouble. I sent it back but that was nothing compared to what happened next - I was apparently punished for daring to send the steak back and was forced to wait and wait for the replacement dish I ordered. I am sure I was waiting for almost three quarters of an hour. I was so enraged that I had actually folded my copy of the Financial Times and was about to leave for Naas town in order to get something to eat. But the food arrived at that point - it took me almost as long again for me to calm myself. What a way for a chef to treat a paying customer...

Walking in the meadow in front of the hotel is recommended but not at night time. There are only two or three of the path-side lamps working. The other fifteen or twenty lights need attention. It is difficult to pick one's way in the dark on that path - not recommended for a lady walker of nervous disposition.

It costs money to purchase premium black Angus steak from Pallas Foods. Throwing such steak in the bin is dilutive to earnings which, of course, Mr. McElligott will feel in his pocket. Mr. McElligott should act on this. Did Martin, the busy manager in Jack's Bar, deal with my complaint about the steak? ""No"", he did not. He was probably too busy...

I recommend that Mr. McElligott forgets the karate next Saturday and that he gets down to Killashee to find out what the 'empowered' management team are up to. He should teach Mr. Gleeson how to do a rare steak and discuss with Martin ways of keeping on top of things in Jack's Bar. Replacing bulbs out front should be a priority too. I paid cash and deserved better than I got! 

I was pleased to see Cú na Mara still in the low field...

Tip: don't expect an egg spoon if your having a boiled egg for breakfast - they haven't got any.",3,2015,05,13
218,What an improvement,"My fiancee and I had a voucher for this hotel
which we were unable to use due to booking
restrictions earlier this year so had to pay for a room on the required night. The whole experience was truly dreadful and would have made Faulty Towers look like The Ritz. Staff were friendly but unprofessional. The Chef sent me a message after being asked the names of the cheeses on the cheese board, that he was very busy and would let me know when he was less busy. There were several other things that truly put me off ever having to come back. Fast forward a few months and the original voucher still needed using so with a heavy heart my children and I checked in again last Friday.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Professional staff, hugely revamped  (much needed) bedrooms  and a huge transformation. Only thing that let it down was the lifts give you the impression they are going to conk out and in fairness the food was not top notch in Jack's Bar. It was okay but I don't want OK, I want really good. Other than that, you can't fault the place. Friendly, clean, stunning rooms and fab atmosphere. Can't believe how something can change so dramatically. Will certainly return.",4,2015,05,13
218,Ideal base for Punchestown festival,"Stayed here 2nd year running, 5 nights ... Bit of a blip on arrival as had booked. Twin but given a double , they did change the room. 
Number one attraction after the facilities are the friendly helpful staff, bar, breakfast, housekeeping ,restaurant , they were always helpful and cheery even though it was a busy week for them. Rooms were large, bathrooms could do with a bit of updating now but adequate. Def back again next year if there is room!",5,2015,05,10
218,Excellent again,"Stayed with a group of friends for my stag, the hotel was excellent yet again. Friendly staff and very accommodating; excellent, spacious rooms; breakfast is superb and everything is 5*. Will be returning again in September. Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,05
218,Fabulous!!!,Had a wonderful weekend here with with a few friends. I firstly have to commend the staff at the hotel. They made us feel so welcome and nothing was too much bother -even though they couldn't find the Benedictine liquor  in any of the 9 bars -sorry about that one Frank but you got us a lovely substitute lol. The food was amazing.  We dined in Jacks on the Friday and Turners on the Saturday.  Both places were excellent and as a bit of a chef im hard to please!! The only downside was the location of the spa and pool. It was across the car park and it was a bit off putting. Once you got used to the layout of the hotel it was easy to navigate but this took time. I would go back again and look forward to a return visit. ,5,2015,05,03
218,Coffee stop,"Myself and a few friends called into this hotel on our way to Kildare Village.  The hotel itself is nice with lovely gardens and is a peaceful location.  However inside it is dark and dreary.  We ordered coffee and scones.  The coffee was fine but the scones terrible.  Either the cream or the milk was gone off.  When we were paying the bill we mentioned this, but got no satisfaction.  The girl on the desk just said ""I cant understand that""  Very bad service.  I would not return again.",2,2015,04,28
218,Large rooms but poorly equipped,"Very pleasant for a weekend away.  Although the rooms are large, if a little dark, they are poorly equipped.  Toiletries in bathroom a little miserly and extractor fan always came on with the light - really annoying for middle of the night visits to the loo.  

The spa was too far away for a quick visit - especially if it is raining - across the car park on the other side of the hotel

Meals in the bar were very nice; the breakfast buffet had the usual fare but the cooked brealfast was very average, a bit tasteless.    

One point that requires mention is that we were asked if we needed assistance with our bags which we declined as we had only one bag each.   However, we were not informed that the room was quite some distance away so it might have been helpful to have known that in advance!",4,2015,04,28
218,Absolutely FAB,"My customer recommend I stay here.
Even driving up I knew I was in for a treat!
What an impressive country hotel and grounds.
Greeted fabulously at reception. The rooms are lovely. All mod cons but keeping the ""old"" style.
The bar/food was lovely. Great choice on the menu. The food was great.
All staff are 
lovely. A big shout out to Martin the restaurant manager who made sure I was looked after.
Highly recommend this place.
I will return with my other half!",5,2015,04,27
218,"Great food,  shocking service,  let down ","I've recently sent an email to the hotels reservation desk as this is whom I booked a romantic meal for myself and my wife for her birthday and received no response as yet not even so much as an acknowledgement of my email,  I think the heading says it all,  it's a beautiful hotel inside and out and the food to match. It's a huge pity the staff on the night let it down!!!  ",1,2015,04,24
218,Lovely experience,"I stayed at this hotel last weekend with a group of friends. We booked under the spa offer. I have to say I was very impressed from the moment I saw the hotel on appoach.  Hotel and grounds very beautiful.
Spa was excellent. A lovely lady gave me a manicure. I didn't catch her name but she was blonde, friendly and knew her stuff when it cane to nutrition. She was very welcoming kind and friendly. 
Dinner was fantastic. Another lovely funny down to earth lady helped us in the dining room. In fact all the staff were lovely and attentive. 
Breakfast was beautifully cooked.
rooms were spacious. We got excellent service right up until we checked out. Overall a great experience.",5,2015,04,22
218,Nice comfortable hotel. Pity about the terrible food,"We got a voucher to use for CHristmas and headed down. We were initially attracted by the leisure facilities which are actually outside the hotel in a separate building. We ate in the bar on Saturday night and the food was TERRIBLE. Over priced, over cooked, under seasoned. I wouldn't give it to a dog. The room was comfortable and clean apart from the valance sheet which hadn't been changed in quite some time it would seem. It was filthy with food stains.  The entertainment in the bar on Saturday was also dire. The breakfast was underwhelming too. Good selection of fruit and cereal but the cooked breakfast lacked flavour and substance. I would say this hotel has great potential but the food lets them down terribly.",2,2015,04,19
218,Very good Hotel,Stayed here again tor one night.  Really quiet room and comfortable bed so had a great sleep.  Work up to birdsong and a beautiful sunny morning.  Freshly cooked breakfast was very good.  Bar very comfortable and excellent coffee    Ate dinner and the food and service was as good as I experienced anywhere.  Used the leisure centre and while it's a short walk way it's very comfortable with a huge range of equipment.  Lovely pool. ,4,2015,04,16
218,A bit of Luxury in Co Kildare,I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff were amazing - the best service I have had in a hotel in Ireland. Nothing was too much bother - they genuinely seemed to care about our stay. The food was of a very high standard the room large and comfortable. The pool and amenities were great - the kids loved the fast wifi. We would recommend the afternoon tea - decadent and delicious. Thank you Killashee - we can't wait to return.,5,2015,04,13
218,A lovely experience,"We stayed in Kilashee HouseHotel to celebrate a low key hen night, and we had a brilliant time in the hotel. The best thing I'd say about the hotel experience has got to be the staff. They cannot do enough to help or accommodate. They were friendly, kind and so pleasant to deal with. I must make a special mention to Conor and Linda in Jacks Bar and Marion the restaurant manager. They were just a pleasure. 

The only minor drawback was the collective group all felt that the Spa was a slight let down. We felt very rushed at times and always against the clock. The girls there were obviously trying their best, but we thought that they could've planned out the appointment times better, because it would definitely make for a nicer experience.",4,2015,04,12
218,Weekend break at Killashee,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed at Killashee for a 2 night break. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, even in grey weather walking around the grounds is thoroughly enjoyable. The hotel itself is quite dated and run down. Wallpaper was coming away from the walls in much of the hotel and the carpet was stained throughout. We were staying on a wing of the hotel that smelled very strongly of paint as they were doing up most of the rooms on the corridor and left the doors open. The room itself was spacious and clean with small defects such a missing handles on wardrobes. We ate in Jack's bar and bistro in the hotel on night one. The food was very disappointing and seemed microwaved. However, there was a great atmosphere in the bar and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast service is tasty with a good selection and quick service. I was extremely disappointed that the pool was in a separate building and was quite unwelcoming due to the fact that the staff in the leisure centre were extremely rude and abrupt, however, this is only true of that I encountered at the leisure centre, the staff in the hotel itself were nothing but friendly. All in all an enjoyable stay but not at all what I would expect from a 4 star hotel.",3,2015,04,12
218,Fantastic friendly place to stay,We went for a 2 night stay in this hotel and have to say it is one of the nicest hotels I have been in.The staff were friendly and very welcoming.The accommodation and food was of the highest standard.and we can't wait to go back again.Would highly recommend it.,5,2015,04,08
218,A train station has more to offer,"The place is like a conveyor belt of ordinary. Absolutely everything about the place is full of functional. There is no joy. The building from the outside is really attractive. That's the good part. The staff are clearly really busy, uninterested. Unless of course you are THE wedding. That may be different. There are far nicer, friendlier hotels that do actually want you there. ",2,2015,04,07
218,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed with a few friends in February for a girly get-together and I can tell you this hotel is something special, from the helpful receptionists and friendly staff it made the stay an even more lovely experience.

We went to use the swimming pool and spa for a bit of pampering and though it is a short walk from the hotel it wasn't a bother. I imagine if it were raining it would be somewhat off putting, but we had no problem.

We arrived back after our treatments to our bedroom which was just divine. The majestic decor of the room was very grand and inviting. Everything in the room was well presented, the bathroom facilities were great and the room was very clean and immaculate, not a hair to be found! The presentation of the room and the entire hotel was very impressive, and I would recommend anyone to stay here.",4,2015,04,07
218,Far beyond expectations - Lovely Hotel,"We had an amazing family Easter family break.  
Lovely setting, beautiful rooms, great kids activities and extremely friendly staff!
We will definitely be back, and recommending to friends.

Highlights:
- Beautiful building
- Stunning grounds (squirrels and rabbits)
- Kids Cinema Night
- Lovely Pool
-Easter Egg Hunt for kids
THE STAFF! - the most naturally friendly bunch I've come across in years.

A huge thanks to staff who were so friendly and welcoming",5,2015,04,07
218,great.,"i love the hotel once i got inside, it amazed me.Even though the hotel was like a maze to me it was still astonishing. the only part was that the staff didnt really tell us were the spa is..which was outside. so we put on our robs and went through the car park.",4,2015,04,07
218,Good points but could be better,Hotel has such potential to be great but lacked in areas. Room lovely and big but carpet had stains and was not hoovered properly. Beds very poorly made with bad creases on the linen. Old fashioned TV.  Shower was good. Food was excellent both dinner and breakfast. Staff though for me was most disappointing. They were efficient but just not friendly at all except for a couple of male foreign waiting staff.  Also some new carpets in areas that when new need to be hoovered regularly but weren't so made the place look bad. Overall could be better if management paid a little more attention. ,3,2015,04,06
218,Overpriced very poor service,"We visited the hotel with my husband and our daughter she is 3 year' s old. We was planning a nice relaxing family weekend, our daughter love swimming and I wanted try the SPA. The swimming pool was not build together with main building we had to walk cross the car park. 

The hotel room was dark, terrible wallpaper, in the bathroom the tiles was falling of from the wall. 

The bar food was blend, tasteless, and they give us a wrong bill. 

No water in the room no minibar, no air conditioning. 

This hotel probably only for weddings.

I wont recommend to anyone who wants a relaxing family weekend.",1,2015,04,05
218,Below Expectations,"I travelled to Killashee House Hotel with My Family having booked a day visit on the internet. Mostly having viewed the Hotel its own website.

This hotel is really a wedding or event hotel and while it caters for families it is not of the quality I would expect from a 4 Star Hotel. 

The layout of the hotel is particularly difficult to fathom. We had to get 2 lifts to get to our room which was not convenient, and no offer was made to assist with our baggage.

Much is made of the Spa and Swimming pool facilities, no mention is made of the fact that the they are not attached to the main buildings and are a 100m walk across a car park to get there. Not something you would reasonably expect. 

The room we stayed in while of generous size for a double was very dark and unwelcoming. The wallpaper if you looked a t it for a moment or two would make you dizzy. The handle of the hot tap on the basin was loose..The condition of the bathroom tiling and grout also left something to be desired, with tiles coming away from the wall and grout missing.

When we looked for robes we found none and had to call reception. There was no water provided in the room and had to call reception. There was not ventilation system in the room, other than opening a window.

Finally the food in the bar was quite bland and not of the quality I expect for the price.",2,2015,04,05
218,Super Barman Adam,"Recently spent the night in Killashee with my husband and friends. Really lovely hotel although quite spread out. Lovely rooms.

Went down for a meal, given the wrong menu so when we ordered a bottle of wine Barman Adam came to our table to advise if same and offer alternative. He was a great humoured extremely attentive young man well into the early hours of the morning. He even made cocktails for us that he hasn't had chance to make.before and they were delicious. I happened to leave my keys behind me and they were waiting for me in reception the next morning. A huge asset to the hotel. ",4,2015,04,04
218,Laura,"Lovely hotel, lunch and dinner in jacks bistro was very tasty, bedroom and bathroom very spacious, Martin was very helpful with information!
Would highly recommend it and also visit the SNUG bar!! 
Laura",5,2015,03,31
218,You leave relaxed and with a smile on your face every time!,"I have been to this hotel numerous times over the past 10 years and I have never been let down. A decade of good service is a tremendous achievement!

I have stayed in this hotel as part of family weddings, friend’s weddings, day trips and general overnight stays. Every time you walk away with a smile. 

The staff are trained to provide impeccable service. I cannot compliment that enough. Everyone from the cleaning staff to management walk around with a smile of their face. You can actually tell the staff enjoy working in this hotel. Each staff member just goes that extra mile to make you feel happy. This is a credit to the management team. 

I do agree the hotel needs a bit of a facelift but working in construction sector I understand this takes time especially when managing a business which never closes its doors.

I would recommend anyone young or old with or without children to stay in this hotel. 

P.S If you do stay be sure to check out the snug bar at the far end of the hotel. It’s so cosy and the barmen are great craic! One barman even went the whole way to the main bar just to get us all some hot nuts. No that’s service!",5,2015,03,31
218,Beautiful ,"Stayed recently with two friends. We all bought a voucher for villa spa from megadeals and decided to make the most of it and stay the night we booked a triple room for €180. When we arrived we were in awe the hotel was stunning inside and out. Our room was a long walk.and two lifts away but when we got there the room was very large with two double beds and a fold out bed. We went to the spa which was so relaxing staff were all very friendly maybe a little too friendly,the girl who gave me my massage and facial never stopped talking I just wanted to relax. The spa itself was beautiful and would definitely return but maybe be a bit more vocal about how I just want some peace. I thought jacks bar was extremely expensive so we went down to naas for something to eat. We got room service the following morning for breakfast but one of our breakfasts were not delivered so did not pay the full price for room service and the staff were very apologetic ",4,2015,03,29
218,"Lovely location and Hotel, its tired but getting the facelift it needs.","We stayed here for a mid week break for my birthday.  Its was really relaxing and we both enjoyed it.

The hotel is set up for big events but it was also good when it was not too busy.  The Bed room was very big and well fitted out, and the bed was really comfortable.  However the place is ‘Tired’ but its currently getting the refurbish it needs.  When this is complete it will be excellent.

We eat in the bar and the food was above what I expected, it was tasty and well presented.  We had dinner on two evenings and everything was super.  The Ardsallagh Goats Cheese, Rare Seared Tuna Loin and Spicy Chicken Wings were all presented in a very artistic way and tasted delicious!  Jack’s “Jelly & Ice Cream” was really yummy!! 

The girl who served us in the restraint was super, friendly and very welcoming.  However some of the rest of the team let her down!  The reception staff were so busy working they never greeted us as we passed, you felt you were interrupting them if you asked them a question, not a great reception!  On the 2nd morning a senior lady was looking after breakfast, she was efficient but very cool, and as soon at 11.00 came she closed the door and left the room.  This was a big contrast to the junior waiter the previous day who came to each table, explained the Buffet was closing and was there anything else we would like.  Again the Lady was so busy going to more important tasks.

The Spa is excellent. I under estimated the Hydrotherapy Suite And didn’t allow enough time to relax in it before my treatment.  It was super and well worth spending the 1.5 hours there that is recommended.  The girl who looked after me after that was excellent and chatty while being professional.  

A really lovely touch is they have a garden dedicated to Debra Ireland a charity that looks after sufferers of  EB, its lovely relaxing spot to walk around ..... and to toss a coin into the fountain.  I hope we will be back!",4,2015,03,29
218,"Huge Hotel with Ample, if ageing, facilities","This hotel is designed for events such as weddings, corporate meetings and the like. The room I was given was huge: it easily encompassed its two double beds with plenty of spare space. There was an iron and a kettle in the room. The showers were hot and had good pressure. However, the television was an old cathode-ray, which points to perhaps to my overall feeling that the facilities are ageing, though not by any means below standard.

The overall feel of the hotel is friendly, but the service was in many instances quite slow. The food in the restaurant was very good, of a high standard at all times, but again service was also somewhat slow. The breakfast took some delay to order, and to arrive, but the pastries and toast were amply available.

Overall I would say that this is a good venue to host an event, as it is close enough to Dublin to be accessible. There did appear to be a bus stop near by, but I would suggest that driving is the best option. There is not much around the place within walking distance, but I suspect that is no drawback if you are there to attend an event.",4,2015,03,28
218,Cool place to stay,"Hotel has character, very clean, staff were friendly, very affordable, full breakfast include as well.  Jack's restaurant in the hotel was aslo very good.  If you get a chance, walk around the grounds, it is beautiful.  I highly recommend this place.",5,2015,03,21
218,Wedding visit,Brilliant venue for a family wedding. Very nice staff and atmosphere with excellent food. The rooms were very well laid out and comfortable. The breakfast provided was the perfect cure for even the most hungover customers.,4,2015,03,17
218,Amazing experience,"Great stay with friends. Service, food and bar area were beautiful. The lovely white tablecloths and linen in restaurant for dinner and breakfast added to the high standards.  Grounds spectacular. Staff couldn't do enough to please us. Definitely will be back!",5,2015,03,17
218,A Great Choice for a Romantic Night Away!,"Having stayed at Killashee House for my sisters wedding in May 2012, we always said we'd love to go back. When trying to settle on somewhere for a Valentine's getaway this year, it seemed like the obvious choice. We booked ourselves in for massages, which were amazing...although there is not much to the hydrotherapy suite so I don't see why guests are charged to enter. We forgot to book in for dinner and given that we stayed on Valentine;s night, both the bar and restaurant were booked out. However the bar manager was able to provide us with a table in an overflow area just off the bar which was perfect! The cocktails are to die for at the bar, definitely worth sampling a few if you are staying at the hotel.

The room was fabulous - one of the most comfortable night's sleep we ever had. Their breakfast menu the next day is worth staying for alone - they have a hot food menu, which even includes pancakes as well as a buffet area. We will definitely be back in the future for yet another stay.",5,2015,03,17
218,Lovely Sunday lunch,"We love this hotel, we got married here back in 2010 so now with kids in tow we went back for Sunday lunch and look around , my wife had roast beef and said it was to die for and I had a steak cooked right, the kids were well looked after too everything was lovely and brought back some good memories ",4,2015,03,16
218,Don't go if you looking for a man !,"Great atmosphere in the place the whole day we were there. Christening party, family parties, and LOADS of groups of women. Had lunch and dinner in the bar both lovely and a great buzz around. Liked the little snug pub for afterwards. 
Not impressed with €25 for file and polish in the spa and would have had to pay a further €10 to use the spa pool etc. hate that when I go somewhere. 
The place is a bit of a maze trying to find the room. Overall a lovely experience was here for a wedding previously and its a great venue",5,2015,03,10
218,Can't recommend highly enough,"I stayed at this hotel for a very special family occasion.  The staff were so professional and helpful in advance of our stay to ensure that everything was in place for the event.  Their attention to detail was excellent.  When we got there, we weren't disappointed - the food, the accommodation, the service, the staff, and the amenities were all fantastic!  Every single member of staff that we encountered went out of their way to help us as much as they could which was very impressive!  My whole family commented on it, so it wasn't just me being biased! Our group ranged in age from 80 down to 8, and the hotel was suitable for all ages - there was something to appeal to everyone. We'll definitely be back.  Thank you so much to all the staff for taking care of us so well!",5,2015,03,09
218,"Great hotel,maybe needs a little updating","we stayed at the hotel for two night in late February for a friends wedding and we had a fantastic time.

The hotel itself is impressive as you approach and is easily accessible and the reception was efficient and friendly.

Walking to our room, which was a bit of a way from reception and up two flights of stairs and down one lift (not good when your drunk!) it was clear that the it is in need of a little bit of money being spent on it, mainly wallpapering and painting.

The room itself was lovely, spacious and although only a standard room came with two king sized beds which were extremely comfortable.

We had either evning meal included and must say it was great, good selection and great quality food served promptly, the waiter was great as well and made us feel very welcome.

We took breakfast in bed both mornings and again was very impressed.

The wedding was ran very well, with food service and quality to a really high standard.

My only small criticism as with most wedding venues is with the price of drinks, extremely high and pushed a lot of people to go to the local town and buy alcohol and sneak it in, I think if hotels dropped their prices by as little as £1 a drink they would make a lot more money from them.

Over all a great stay and would definitely return",4,2015,03,09
218,Wedding Party,"Very warm and efficient welcome in reception, although we were early, room was ready. Wedding and accommodation was in 'The Original House' which was very comfortable and has great character. Wedding meal was lovely and the staff were excellent throughout. Room was spacious, very quite and comfortable. Overall a lovely experience.",5,2015,03,07
218,Relaxing,Spa break was fantastic. The historic history linked to this hotel is really interesting. Found St Patrick's well. It's meant to have healing powers for your eyes. Room 145 was ideal with lovely views. The only thing was a bit of a let down was theì food. Bar menu has changed and is very basic. Breakfast in the morning  is a let down. Hot food is to order but this isn't great. Would recommend  hotel and will definitely  be  back,5,2015,03,06
218,Attention to detail and good customer service.,"Only a one night stay but room was excellent and very comfortable. The restraunts were very good with an excellent selection of meals available which are served by polite attentive people who seem trully concerned that you enjoy the experience.
My trip was for business but I would certainly recommend this hotel for a long weekend, especially with all the recreational facilities the hotel offers.",4,2015,03,05
218,Spa Day,"Recently I received a gift voucher for the Villa Spa at the Killashee. I booked in for my Mum to be massage a week before my treatment and the girls told me to arrive 30 minutes before my treatment to get organised. When i arrived the ladies where very friendly and showed me to the locker room and changing area where i had a beautiful fresh robe and crisp white slippers . I was allowed access to there new pool room with Jacuzzi and relaxation chairs, it looked beautiful but due to being heavily pregnant i choose not to . I then filled out a short consultation form and was soon greeted by the lovely Michelle who took me to my treatment room, Michelle was extremely considerate of me she asked if i was okay to use the stairs and showed me to the bathroom before my treatment . I felt so relaxed and knew i was in good hands. We went into the treatment room that was stunning decorated to the highest standard the heat was perfect and the room smelt amazing. Michelle told me about herself and the experience she had with pregnancy massages etc we had a chat about the consult form and Michelle asked me how my pregnancy was going . Michelle showed me the products she was going to be using and explained all about then. Michelle made me feel so relaxed and i was extremely comfortable on the massage bed . I could have stayed there all day it was amazing !!!!   I left the massage room feeling so relaxed , Michelle then took me to a beautiful relaxation room she made me extremely comfortable with cushions for my back and feet i got a lovely warm blanket and a big hug from Michelle who wished me the best of luck with my pregnancy and told me to pop up when i had the baby for a facial as Michelle works closely with clients throughout pregnancy and after.  In the relaxation room i got fresh fruit and fresh fruit water it was a great end to the day i stayed for 30 minutes and went on my way. On the way out i purchased the products Michelle had used on me as it made my skin feel like silk and treated myself to the elemis face kit as well as the bath milk that i can use post pregnancy ,  I also received a free gift of elemis products in a make up bag. I could not fault the Villa spa or the staff in anyway my experience was extremely enjoyable and it was due to Michelle making me feel so relaxed and comfortable",5,2015,03,03
218,Spa Day,"Spent a day here with my Mum and absolutely loved the Spa. Hydro therapy pool and relaxation room are just lovely. Service from the Spa team was impeccable, special mention to Sharon who looked after us so well.",5,2015,03,03
218,Just love visiting Killashee,"Had a fantastic stay recently at my brothers 40 th celebration. I have stayed here on a number of occasions, and have always had a great time. Lovely food, great breakfast and super staff. They are really professional, and you just know they genuinely care. Fab room, love the leisure centre. I don't mind a stroll across the car park. This is an old convent to the best of my knowledge so I am glad that they are maintaining the original house character.",5,2015,03,02
218,Spa experience,"I had the Winter indulgence package in the Spa this weekend. The treatments were amazing, staff were all lovely, a couple of things I felt however would help make the experience even better. The aromatherapy bath was quite high up and I found it quite tricky to get out of it, also my towel was left far away from it, it would have worked better if the beautician could have been more on hand to assist in getting out of the bath and have the towel handy, she helped when getting in.... It was strange walking across the floor sopping wet to get to my towel. Also, in comparison to other spas, only lemon water was available, no herbal tea, fruit juice or coffee, Dunboyne Castle provides these all complimentary so this came across as somewhat mean... Also we had a full Spa day and we paid an additional €10 each to use the hydrotherapy facilities however we were hungry at lunchtime and when I asked if there was any possibility to get food-there was none so we had to get dressed, go across to have our food to the bar across the carpark etc. in the snow and then come back, get undressed again etc. this was really silly, some healthy food options would be really worth considering -it was very inconveniencing! Fridges were in the location as we were given a tiny pit of fruit after our treatments.",4,2015,03,02
218,Kilashee needs a massive overhaul,"Every part of the hotel needs to be redecorated. Hotel has shabby wallpaper and dirty carpets throughout. Emergency exit left open, big yellow skip outside door. Bathroom was small, no separate shower . Breakfast was good but service was poor.  ",1,2015,03,01
218,Great Hotel on Beautiful Grounds - Had something for the whole family,"I visited this hotel with my boyfriend's family for his dad's big birthday.  There were 11 of us in total (one baby, two children, eight adults).  

We had a really great weekend all round.  Arrived on the Friday to find that the parents room had been upgraded due to the special occasion.  The rest of our rooms were lovely but the upgraded room was absolutely fantastic.  It was gorgeous and spacious and even had a four poster bed.

We had bar food for dinner one evening and lunch one day which was good and the couple with children availed of a babysitting service which they were very pleased with.  

The grounds are beautiful and we all had a great time exploring .

Excellent leisure facilities - the only draw back being that it's in a separate building to the hotel so you have to walk across the car park. Besides that, we found it very good. (Though perhaps someone keeping an eye on the Jacuzzi/Sauna/Steam Room area would be a good idea - we had to share the Jacuzzi with a couple who thought it was appropriate to make their six year old get in and swim around in it while complaining about being too hot!)

Breakfast both mornings was excellent - they were able to accommodate our large group all at one table, no problem at all. Great service and food and not much of a wait even though it was busy. We also had dinner in the restaurant.  The food was great and the staff were so friendly and attentive.

They only lose some marks on sleep as there was a wedding on the Saturday night.  The band could be heard but not enough to keep you awake - it was a little nice actually... the problem was that our room was on the same corridor as some of the more rowdy wedding guests who were shouting up and down the corridor to each other in the middle of the night.  The rest of our party (one much further down on our corridor and the rest on different floors) all had a great night's sleep - no noise issues at all - so we were just unlucky.",4,2015,02,24
218,"Excellent stay, food and service.","Although it was only a 1 night stay. The ambiance and standard of the hotel made it feel a whole lot longer. I must say the highlight was the meal in Turners. The food was positively exquisite and I must give special commendations to the waitress Kimberley whose service was prompt, kind and cordial. She also handled a spilt wine glass with above par courtesy. The breakfast the following morning was also excellent with a wide selection of foods. Unfortunately I do not remember the names of the other great staff but rest assured I would highly recommend this hotel to others and I myself would definitely stay again.",4,2015,02,23
218,Sensational Spa Day,"I enjoyed a wonderful day at the spa with friends. Facilities are fabulous and at a competitive rate. Thank you to Beauty Therapist Hayley who was so friendly and professional. The hydrotherapy pool is fabulous. The only bother I had was that there was no shower gel provided in the showers. Overall, a wonderful experience in beautiful settings which I highly recommend.",5,2015,02,23
218,Birthday break,"Once again Killashee House Hotel provided a first class experience. On a two day birthday break we decided to travel over to Naas and return to Killashee where the food is excellent, the staff are courteous and very helpful and always willining to assist.

The gardens are spread out throughout the grounds and have little nooks and crannies, with a couple of Fountains, and a short walk to see the Graveyard of many of the nuns who worked there as long ago as the 1930`s are laid to rest. 

Dining either in Turners Restaurant or Jacks Bar the visitor is assured of a friendly professional service also although the Hotel was being freshened up by painters there was ni inconvenience to the guests. In fact before we left all evidence of workmen being there had disappeard. Highly recommend a visit to this superb Country House hotel.",5,2015,02,22
218,Excellent ,"I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel, set nicely in fab grounds with a lovely drive up to it, the main part of the hotel is a lovely building. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. 
Staff are all very friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere in the bar for a few drinks",5,2015,02,22
218,Wedding,We attended a wedding reception in Kilashee House two weeks we had such a good experience from we arrived  until our departure .The staff were so helpfull the food was fabulous  we thought it was such a lovely venue to hold a wedding reception .We will definitely return during the summer to enjoy the beautiful gardens and walks.,5,2015,02,18
218,Relaxing family break,"We have had a very relaxing 3 day break in the Killashee House Hotel. I travelled with my 17 year old daughter and 12 year old son. I only gave 4 stars for service as there was a mix up in our room but my children agreed to take turns sleeping in the camp bed and both said it was very comfortable. Our deluxe room with twin Queen beds was certainly spacious enough to fit it in and meant they didn't have to share a bed. Our package included breakfast a 4 course meal in Jack's bistro. The food was excellent with very generous portions. We all enjoyed using the pool- towels and toiletries are provided,  and as check out isn't until 12noon there was even time for a swim on our last morning. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The grounds are worth a walk round and my 2 children made use of the hotels bicycles. Kildare shopping village is only a 10 minute drive away and I was grateful for the extra discount card provided by the hotel. Next time I intend to try out the hotel's spa facilities!",5,2015,02,18
218,"Fantastic location, excellent facilities and staff","I celebrated my 40th birthday party at Killashee House Hotel earlier this month and cannot praise them enough. We were given a separate private space off the main bar, which was a really nice size for the crowd that we brought in. The staff, from the moment we arrived 'til the moment we checked out, were fantastic. Our every whim was catered for, and always with a smile. It's a busy hotel, with weddings/functions on almost every day of the week, but at no time did the staff look harried or rushed; the service was excellent and always prompt. We ate in the main restaurant and in the bar, as well as having finger food served at the birthday party, and all of the food was superb. Being a vegetarian, I can sometimes be difficult to please, but the variety of menu items available to me was both impressive and very tasty. The location of the hotel is absolutely lovely - only a few minutes from Naas, yet gave a wonderful country house feel to it. Whether you're looking for a weekend away or a wedding, I can't recommend Killashee House highly enough.",5,2015,02,18
218,Dee 1 ,"I have just returned from a two night break in the hotel and was disappointed . At a first glance the  hotel is very impressive but after five minutes it feels more like an industrial complex the bar was awful really tacky with huge dated 70 s decor , the food in the bar was very basic not great .. the bedrooms are miles away , the pool is outside and across the carpark !! Very strange with very basic cold changing rooms . The staff were friendly and professional ..The bedrooms were lovely the breakfast and dining room was very nice but is very strange to close the beautiful dining room and the traditional bars all week !! So the only choice is the awful 70 s bar x I would not return to this hotel again unless it had major changes !!",2,2015,02,17
218,Going downhill,"Made a stop in at the Kilashee on Saturday 14th March to have a bite to eat and watch the Irish rugby match. Arrived in the bar and nearly all bar a very few tables were reserved and empty. Went to the bar and was ignored by all staff for at least seven minutes until I sharply called at one. I asked about a table, none available was the response, asked about the match and was told that it would be on the small television and that they would not be turning up the sound!!
We have been here many times before and I have reviewed the hotel well. This time around I was so disappointed and pissed off with the staffs attitude, also so many tables emptied and reserved. We turned on our heels and left, we went to the Osprey were we were greeted pleasantly and had a great evening.
Killashee is going downhill and the lack of customer attention is real bad.
I have read  a lot of the replies from the hotel on poor reviews they have had, so I ain't expecting anything productive as a reply.
Pity, as we did like visiting Kilashee for food and drinks. :-(",2,2015,02,16
218,Amazing hotel and even better service,"We stayed here over Valentines weekend and i must say it was outstanding. Every single staff member we met were so nice and so helpful. The highlight of our stay was  the meal we had booked in the restaurant for Valentines night. We were so well looked after. Even when i left the table to visit the ladies room, our waitress came to the table and took my plate into the kitchen to keep my meal warm (this was in the height of a busy meal service). When it was returned to me the chef had refreshed the plate with new veg etc! It really is the small things that make the difference
Would highly recommend the hotel for a nice couples break, very relaxing and beautiful surroundings!",5,2015,02,16
218,Never stay here,We booked a room overlooking gardens got a room with a skip outside complained got a room with large hedge outside. Valentines weekend booked in for 2 days so they put us in a room overlooking carpark. We left after 1 nite riduculous service too busy to care. We may have come back again but just not good enough service for horrible views.,1,2015,02,15
218,100% CUSTOMER SERVICE,"We stayed here on 12th February for my husbands birthday.  The receptionist Michelle was particularly nice and when she heard it was my husbands birthday organised for him to have a ""birthday plate"" at our meal.  She also upgraded us to a magnificent suite which was absolutely beautiful, from the four poster bed to the chocolates on the pillows and the macaroons and sparkling water on the table.  The meal which was served in the bar was really good, particularly my husbands starter of mushroom with fried egg and salad.  Then we had our dessert served at the fireplace and the waitress brought out the birthday plate with a candle and she even sang happy birthday. The breakfast was absolutely delightful, and the waitress said I could mix and match, so I had the cinnamon and maple syrup pancake and the sausage rasher and egg.  The selection at breakfast was outstanding.

We will definitely return to this beautiful hotel with its lovely staff and beautiful grounds.",5,2015,02,13
218,Fabulous,"Absolutely lovely place to stay. Staff are lovely and so helpful. 

The rooms are gorgeous, so spacious as for the gardens, lovely even in winter, I can imagine how beautiful they must look in the summer.

I would definitely recommend Killashee.",5,2015,02,12
218,Birthday Dinner,"Recently celebrated my birthday and had dinner in Turners Fine Restaurant in the Killashee Hotel  I have to say one of the better restaurants i have been to in a while . The service and attention to detail from the staff  was great and the menu had good options, lots to choose from  the food was just amazing and i will be back here again the rooms in the hotel were good and id would stay here again  , Top Restaurant and top Hotel.",4,2015,02,10
218,Appalling service,"Having just returned from lunch in Jack's Bar in Killashee House Hotel which was a family outing to celebrate a birthday, my overall impression - apart from one helpful member of staff - was of a chaotic lack of training on the part of the staff.  Although the main lunch rush was over, it seemed to take ages for anybody to take our order and for orders to be delivered to the table.  At one stage, one of our party had to get up from the table to get the wine order - which had been sitting on the bar counter - before everybody had finished the main course!  Coffees and tea came before desserts and nobody checked as to how the table was doing during the meal.  At one stage, a member of staff dropped a glass near to the table and there was no attempt to make the area safe before clearing same.  

The food was good but not of the standard for the prices charged.",2,2015,02,08
218,Very poor service .,"i visited killashee hotel last november for a long awaited get together of my sisters and neices. the plan was to have a nice relaxing afternoon tea in a nice quiet area where we could chat and catch up.. i rang in advance and asked and requested if this was possible and was assured that they could facilitate my request. on arrival we were hurridlyl ushered into an annexe off the bar which was dark and dinghy.... there were ten of us and we were sat at an oblong table which is not conjusive to afternoon tea. the noise was deafening and it just got worse and worse. we waited 20 mins and eventually were given one small pot of tea and coffee followed a half hour later with the food.  shocking experience, we had to shout to hear each other because the noise from the lounge/bar was deafening.  i mentioned my grievence at payment but if fell on deaf ears. i subsequently wrote to the manager and albeit i did  receive a reply , it did not offer any recompense for the terrible day and experience we all had. i would never return to this hotel and i have heard from numerous people who feel likewise. management need a lesson in PR. please take note that if you offer a service then you are obliged to fullfill the needs of your guests and if they do not meet the guests standards then  a compromise should be made. i feel this hotel has drastically disimproved over the last number of years, it used to be one of the most sought after hotels and i would have celebrated many an occasion there but the revamp and new management has in my eyes done it a huge injustice.",1,2015,02,04
218,Amazing,"Stayed for 3 nights over a weekend, the whole experience was amazing. 
The hotel was busy but we still felt like we were being made to feel special.
Couldn't fault a thing and will defiantly stay again.",5,2015,01,27
218,Unwelcoming experience,My self and my fiancé visited here last feb to look at the idea of booking the hotel for our wedding. I must say it was one of the worst hotel receptions I ever received. We had booked into a meeting with the coordinator and we were pretty much rushed from one part of the hotel to the other. Felt totally unwelcome and in the way. Would not re commend it to anyone thinking of making a wedding or corporate booking. Customer service was non existent.,1,2015,01,27
218,"Very Good service, spa, leisure centre and hotel experience","Stayed here with a number of girlfriends for a two night package with dinner and two spa treatments.  The staff were lovely, any issues were dealt with efficiently.  I had to query the calculations on my final bill and was ready for battle, but I didn't need to worry because the girl at Reception patiently listened and everything was sorted with minimal fuss and took items off the bill for the inconvenience caused.
The spa was great - but the leisure centre was fab!!!!  My only gripe is that the heating is on too high.
The food was above average hotel fayre but the afternoon tea is something not to be missed - very special.
Would recommend to all!!  Extremely good value for money.  I will definitely be back.",4,2015,01,26
218,good food but tired decor,I visited with my partner for a function. This is a large hotel with copious amounts of families with children everywhere. The food in the restaurant was excellent but the rooms are not as nice as they appear in the photos. They are adequate and comfortable but really in need of a refurbishment.,4,2015,01,23
218,Nice rooms but little atmosphere,"I staid sunday to Friday on a business rrip.
I staid ina room on the second floor, room was approx. 7x7m, including the bathroom. The room had working heating, the bathroom had heated towelrack. The bathroom was well equipped with double sink, big mirror, wc, bathtub and separate shower-cabin. The hoel has strange layout...get to rooms on second floor by making your way to the third floor (indicated as 2 in the elevator) walinking across 4 m of corridors to descend to the second floor by taking another elevator to floor 2. 
The hotelbar is big, but missing 'ambiance'.
Breakfast is buffet or a-la-carte
The hotel offers free access to a well-equipped fitness-centre (did not visit) wich is in another building (35m) from the backside of the hotel ans is open for public
",4,2015,01,21
218,A Kildare Gem!!!,"I had the pleasure of visiting the Kilashee House Hotel as part of a touring show. I have visited many hotels and hands down the staff and service at Kilashee House Hotel came up trumps! 

We arrived early on the sunday to set up and sound check, meanwhile the staff were pulling out all the stops and had a separate room ready with a complimentary meal.

As I was not feeling too well I skipped the meal but later in the night it was not a problem to order anything I wished and all was brought fresh and prompt!

The staff and management are trained beyond the average! Brian and Killian were looking after us and absolutely nothing was a problem!!! 

The rooms are very plush, classic and luxurious with bags of character. They have certainly kept the original theme of the old house throughout! The beds are so comfortable and very large. Although I didnt have time to visit the spa the offers available were very reasonable and it was a beautiful spa. The surrounding grounds are very picturesque I only wish I had the pleasure of staying longer.

I will certainly be back for another wonderful stay! ",5,2015,01,19
218,"Nice spa, some improvements needed ","Overall the spa is nice and relaxing. The treatments were enjoyable and good value too. 

The staff were nice and friendly, although some were a little hurried at times.

There was no moisturiser or conditioner available in the changing room. That's surprising and disappointing. I was a day spa customer so had none with me.  I haven't come across that before. No know it may seem like a minor point, but it was really annoying.

Also, there was an extra charge to use their new hydrotherapy suite. When I booked it I didn't mind paying it but when I was there it seemed like people who hadn't booked/paid were popping in to use it. I ended up resenting a charge I didn't have a problem with when I booked.

",4,2015,01,18
218,Another amazing stay,"Returned for the third time and we weren't disappointed 
Staff are so helpful especially with our little girl. 
Leisure facilities are amazing and the walks also.
So impressed we are already planning our next visit ",5,2015,01,17
218,Excellent ,"I'm amazed & what some people complain about I often wonder do they ever enjoy themselves anywhere! Killashee House Hotel was everything & more that we could have asked for. From check in from friendly staff to the upgrade we received  (without asking) made the experience just warm relaxing & sorry to leave. We ate in Jacks bar where the food was tasty bistro style & reasonable. Breakfast had a great selection on offer, from traditional Irish to Pancakes or even Mackerel. Really could not fault any bit, it is an old building but the cleanliness & decor really are to a very acceptable standard. Personally we can't wait to go back, loved it!",5,2015,01,15
218,Lunch,"Had lunch in killashee Hotel  today with my sister . Lunch was lovely .staff very friendly made us welcome . Gala took our order ,such lovely girl ,very chatting .  This is wonderful hotel ,very posh .  Lovely garden  for a walk . Will be back .",5,2015,01,11
218,Poor Lunch,I had lunch here recently and was most disappointed with it. My friend ordered the mushrooms and the portion wouldn't feed a bird. My club sandwich was tiny. The chips were greasy. In fact everything was greasy and coated in salt. Our dessert order was mixed up- as was our coffee order. There were only two of us and it was very straight forward. I would not be going back,2,2015,01,10
218,New Years Party Dinner Dance,"Attended a really nice New Year's Eve dinner dance at Killashee House Hotel. This is really a wonderful hotel situated on  tree lined grounds approximately one mile south of Naas town. As usual, the staff were real friendly, gave first class service and the quality of the meal was excellent. The Hotel couldn't be more helpful and the revelry went on until the early hours. This is a highly recommended hotel for a wedding or party function with capacity to cater for large numbers with ample parking facilities.",5,2015,01,07
218,Found very definitely wanting....,"We stayed here to be near friends for the New Year. We had very specific requests which I ran through in detail with the reservation staff and also (I believed) confirmed a specific room identified from the website. I explained I was bringing my husband for a relaxing break to go racing at nearby Punchestown and Fairyhouse and meet up with friends nearby.We had originally booked the K Club but moved to here as it was nearer to our friends. WHAT A MISTAKE! We checked in to be met by an enormous queue of wedding guests doing the same. When I eventually reached the desk I commented we would not have stayed had we known of the weddings. The receptionist's retort was "" we have two a day for all three days you are here"" We then took a long hike through said wedding guests, past a room set up for the ceremony to a corridor of Junior Suites. A dim dark room greeted us with a four poster bed and a sloping uncomfortable bed (not the room pictured on the website and agreed by reservations) I called down to query this and was told they were fully booked and could not move us. At this point probably a quick call to the K Club should have been my next move, however we  negotiated a possible move on the morrow. The upside was we dined in Jack's Bistro and both the food and service were extremely good. The next day, on our return from Punchestown we had been moved into the room of our choice and whilst we had again had to wade our way though wedding guests we were out for the evening and as a result were less troubled by the throng of people. The following day, being New Year's Day we had a long queue for breakfast and again, whilst the quality of the food and staff was good it all looked too worn around the edges. Our final evening included a ""gourmet dinner"" in Turners restaurant. This was perhaps the biggest disappointment of the three days. We both ordered Caesar salad which had one shaving of Parmesan between the two plates and was made with rocket instead of the promised Little Gem and of the bacon lardons also mentioned there was no sign at all. We mentioned all of this to the waiter who returned to tell us they had run out of lettuce so substituted with rocket! In actuality the very tired décor of Turners and the quality of the food led us to conclude we would have been better off in Jack's Bistro but that was closed. In conclusion perhaps amongst my list of criteria for the room should have been ""have you any weddings"" and I will add this to my list of questions. Clearly the total bill was nowhere near the K Club equivalent and the hotel removed the supplement for the first night, however their is a saying about value and whatever the cost the value here was poor and the quality compromised. I understand the hotel was purchased in August and is to have money spent which it very clearly needs. I do hope they retain the staff, particularly in the Bistro as they were excellent.",3,2015,01,07
218,"Dirty, run down, huge disappointment","This is our first ever negative review but just felt so disappointed with our recent stay. We have stayed at this hotel before and we were absolutely shocked at how the standards had fallen and how dirty and run down it has become. We have 8 children and as you can imagine almost impossible to get away just the two of us, so we were delighted to receive a gift voucher for the Kilashee and we were looking forward to a pampered break and a nice meal. We checked in on Sat 3rd staying for one night we arrived early at 2.30 and were checked in promptly, when entering the lift we noticed the carpet torn and badly stained  also the mirror in the lift was cracked. On the way to our room we noticed how rough the hallways were with shabby and torn wallpaper and stained carpet. On entering our room there was a musty smell, we opened the window, and as we had to meet friends in Dublin we left quickly and drove into the city. On returning at 8pm the smell seemed worse I inspected the room to find the room very grubby and wallpaper torn and badly stained lamp shades, only that we had a gift voucher we would have left and booked elsewhere. We thought about asking to be moved to a cleaner room but we decided that with the hotel being so run down and us checking out the following morning that we would just go to dinner and try and enjoy our night out. We booked a table at Jacks restaurant we asked for a quiet table  away from the noise but we ended up right beside the door which got very cold as guests were going in and out for their cigarette breaks, but it was quieter. When my husband ordered the steak he was told that there was a 10 euro surcharge as we had booked a package so we had to order off a set menu which was quiet limited, I also ordered a starter off the full menu and was told that there would be a 5 euro surcharge, I ordered a seared loin of tuna and expected it would be hot but was disappointed with it served cold, my husbands Steak was just perfect but he ordered garlic butter and it was served with pepper sauce. So he had to wait for garlic butter. We weren't happy with the standard of the food or the long wait between courses, but as we haven't been away on our own in 3 years we decided to make the most  of it and not let it ruin or night. On checking out we queried the 15 euro surcharge for our meal and we were told that it was not put on our bill. Please if you are contemplating staying at this hotel think again, I have posted photos",1,2015,01,04
218,Warm and Welcoming,"Spent a lovely evening in Jacks Bar, we celebrated my Husbands Birthday, we were greeted by Robert who had reserved a lovely table for us, a very friendly and efficient young man, and Steph took our order and looked after us so well, nothing was too much trouble, the food was delicious,and the ,  yummy,and Martha the pastry chef Thank You for the wonderful Birthday cake you made, all the staff make you feel so welcome, we had a wonderful day ",5,2015,01,04
218,Beautiful place to stay,"We had a really nice weekend away here for £260 including daily breakfast and 1 night 3 course meal . The room was nice with a very comfy bed although the tv was almost as old as the building . 
The staff were great and couldn't have done more for us . I would recommend anyone to stay here you will not be disappointed .",4,2015,01,04
218,Disappointing!!!,"Myself and my partner stayed in this hotel December 2014. 
Firstly we were highly insulted checking in as a same sex couple having booked a double room we were then asked if we wanted to change to twin beds!!! 
We found the hotel to be very run down and basic, definately not worth a 4 star rating or the pricing of the rooms. Corridors were cold and rooms absolutely freezing. 
Requesting food without diary both before arrival and on ordering at the hotel I was presented with a soup containing cream and a risotto with cheese... 
Thankfully we were at an event for most of the day and our stay was only for the 1 evening. 

",2,2015,01,02
218,Fantastic hotel,"Just stayed at this hotel which was the venue for my friends wedding on nee years eve. Fantastic reception, room was very luxurious bed was really comfortable the food was delicious, stass helpful and friendly, will certainly go back again",5,2015,01,01
218,"Disappointing, poor and dated.","It was shabby and rundown, obvious that no money has been invested to update and even maintain. Does not deserve a four star rating. It is set in beautiful surrounds. We ate in the bar,  and the bar food was very good,and the service was great. However downhill after that the bedroom was tired, carpets were flithy and the bathroom was grubby. Oh we also had an unwelcome visitor, a mouse. Breakfast buffet was disappointing and underwhelming, full irish was undercooked. Very disappointed , i never write reviews but I was so compelled after such an experience in a four star hotel.",2,2015,01,01
218,Beautiful Hotel for a Wedding,"Attended a family members wedding here recently, small enough wedding with Ceremony and reception all within the hotel. The decor of the majority of the hotel, the setting, staff, food was exceptional but having worked in Hotels for several years I had noticed a few things that could have been better.

I understand that - it's a wedding so guests aren't expected to stay in rooms for very long but In the majority of 4* hotels i have stayed in and in the few that I have worked in, you would be supplied with Tea/Coffee making facilities as well as bottled water, both Sparkling and Still. None of this was supplied.

The bathrooms were huge and was well equipped in so far as it had a huge shower as well as a his and hers sink. Sadly the grime within the grout on the tiles took away the luxury of having such a bathroom for the night.

Minor detail here but the lamp shades on either side of the beds should be straightened as well as the seam of the shade facing the wall so guests cannot see it. As I said, minor but spotted none the less.

The Armchair in the room was greasy and grubby looking.

It is really just the attention to detail that needs to be looked at.

It isn't all bad though because myself and my wife had an exceptional time and the wedding itself was probably the best wedding I've been too. As mentioned above, the food was superb, I mean really really really superb.

The staff were super friendly and pristine in appearance and went out of their way to accommodate you. 

So all in all, very pleasant stay and with 3 kids, getting away for a night is heaven, just wish the room lived up to the price you were paying for it.",4,2014,12,31
218,Hotel is freezing cold! ...,"Ok I stayed in this hotel over the weekend just gone, December ! 27th. And I have to say I am very very disappointed! As the hotel is graded 4 star! It's far from a 4 star... The hotel and bedrooms are freezing cold! , the walls and doors are grubby and marked, I also had a mouse in my bedroom! And moved rooms during the night . The food is overly priced and not to standard at all! 30 minutes waiting on 2 bowls of chips.... , I didn't enjoy my stay at all in this hotel, and wouldn't go back if I was given a room for free. ",3,2014,12,30
218,Lovely hotel with great staff.,"We stayed on the 26th December. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Nothing seemed to be a problem.  The rooms were clean and spacious. Breakfast was good with a great choice of hot and cold food. We didn't have afternoon tea bit it looked fab. There was a good choice at dinner and the food was nice and overall good standard. The swimming pool was area was very clean with sauna, steam room and jacuzzi at each end. Enjoyed our whole experience at Kilashee and we will return. ",4,2014,12,28
218,"Good Hotel, about to get a make over.","We stayed for a night at the start of December. We were always found of this hotel. Its in a great location, just far enough outside of Naas town to feel secluded but still close enough is you needed anything.
The staff have always been very good and this time was no exception. The food as always was an excellent standard so you wont be disappointed. 
This time however I did find that the room was a bit tired, in need of a freshening up with dated furnishing and TV etc. 
I found out on checkout that the entire hotel is due a makeover starting the end of December. If I was to make 1 suggestion is that with the proposed work going on I would avoid staying until the spring just in case there's any disruption. 
But other than that I do like this hotel and I would recommend without hesitation.",4,2014,12,27
218,Fabulous,"Stayed on 5th December , I was attending a wedding , Everything about my stay was fantastic , I have stayed in a numerous amount of hotel this year , and Kilashee was with out a dout the best , beautiful hotel throughout , rooms were outstanding , food was amazing , staff were so friendly and polite and couldn't do enough to make my stay perfect , especially a young waiter Adam ? I was a very difficult costumer at times and this young fella was excellent . I will defiantly be returning to this hotel . Well done to ALL involed  in the running of Kilashee 👍",5,2014,12,07
218,Spa overnight stay,"Myself and my mam stayed in this hotel last weekend, it was €340 for overnight stay for 2, 3 course meal and 2 25min spa treatments each! Good value for money! The food was amazing in the restaurant everything cooked to perfection and the service was second to none! We had food in the bar for lunch aswell was top notch could not fault it! My only down fall would be that the leisure centre and spa is not connected to the hotel so you had to walk outside to access same, not good in the freezing cold weather just out of the pool!!brrr but overall throughly enjoyed my stay and I will be back!! ",4,2014,12,05
218,Outstanding visit at Killashee House,"My daughter and I stayed at the Killashee House in Naas at the end of October. The accommodations couldn't have been better. Staff is especially attentive and helpful. We had breakfast there every morning and a lunch and dinner.  The food, bars, spa, and rooms exceeded our expectations.",5,2014,12,02
218,Excellent,"I was here over the weekend and again it has been a long time,like visiting an old friend. I visited here a lot but since the closed the nuns kitchen I went off it as it was too big and lost its appeal to me well I bit the bullet and went again to confirm my last visit in August was no fluke. And it was excellent very attentive service very friendly and again very engaging staff they talk as if they know you and are funny my daughter loves that they talk to her as an adult its warming. The food is very good tasty and not too dear so its really worth visiting. On the Hotel it has an appeal that any time I have been always make me want to book a room. I would love to see how she looks first thing in the morning and last thing at night just to huge her worth (like a woman with no makeup)",5,2014,12,01
218,Business but a pleasure,"Stayed at this hotel in mid November, We booked a room very late in the day.
Booking over the phone was simple and made even easier by the extreamly helpful receptionist.
We arrived at about 2am and were directed to our room by a pleasant member of staff.
The room was beautiful, lovely and clean a nice big room with a desk, table and chairs, king size bed and a spacious wardrobe. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The only item to pick up in the room if any would be the out of date TV, this could have done with a more modern one and maybe a tad bigger.
The nights sleep was needed and made better with a soft and comfortable bed to snuggle into. There was no noise from the coridore or other rooms which again made it a pleasant night sleep.
The following morning we arrived for breakfast and we were greatest with a lovely cheerful female staff member, who was only to happy to help. The breakfast was amazing and I had the American style pancakes, that was melt in the mouth and well and truly set me up for the day thanks to the good portion. Cereal, toast and juice was all available. 

Overall this was an hotel that I would only be to happy to stay in again. The lovely history and design of the building added to the stay.
I would recommend this to anyone that was thinking of staying here and only wish that I had allowed some time to try the spa, but there is always a next time.",5,2014,11,29
218,Best Spa ever,"Myself & 2 friends went on a spa break for 2 nights to the lovely Killashee House Hotel & Spa. We had a voucher from pigsback for the Spa,
Check in was super fast & the girls were very friendly. The room was lovely with plenty of space.
The spa was excellent. We had a number of treatments done & the staff were so professional, friendly & punctual. There was no hanging around, they were super efficient. I have to say its 1 of if not the best spa iv been to. we will definitely be back. We then got our hair done in the lovely salon in the spa. They also were so friendly, they took all 3 of us straight away when we arrived. We left very happy. 
The only negative point I would make is the room service food was not great. We ordered a Pizza with just ham & cheese & it wasn't the best. We actually couldn't eat it. We got charged €19 for it which we taught was outrageous, but we wouldn't let it stop us from coming back.

I would highly recommend this hotel & spa. 

Cant wait to go back... 

Grainne Sheridan",5,2014,11,24
218,A cold spa,"I was given a voucher for the Killashee Spa and was looking forward to my day. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Lots of waiting around before they start the treatments. The first treatment was the flotation bed, which was fine but nothing special. Then more waiting around. The next treatment was a body message and a mini facial. Both which were  fine except for the fact that the room was freezing and the poor beauticians hands were cold, which made the whole experience not pleasant which defeats the whole purpose of going to a spa. After the treatments back to the relaxing room for the smallest portion of fruit I have ever been given in a spa.",2,2014,11,23
218,Bad reception service,"Had a girl's weekend there and checking in was a nightmare; receptionist questioning the price we were quoted VERY loud in reception area! 30 minutes later we eventually come to an agreement. We get to the rooms and call reception to request robes; and forty minutes later (and two calls later!) they arrived no apology! The next morning at check out Head of Reception has the same issue with the price quoted on out reservation and starts a loud shouting episode telling us she's the manager and what she said was right? We had to go through the same thing as night before but even worse, all this in full view of everyone at reception. When she realised that the error was not ours instead of an apology- we got a justification (we have a lot of junior staff who don't ahve all the correct information) again; not our problem! On our way out we met another lady at the door saying ""I hope you sorted it out as we had an issue with payment as well; they're very rude""",1,2014,11,23
218,Weekend break,"We visited Killashee House Hotel for the first time for two nights on the 15th November, expecting the Hotel to be good we were absolutely delighted with all the best things that you would expect from a 4 star establishment. The staff on arriving could not have been more helpful. The food was excellent starters main courses and sweets were freshly made to order. The dining experience in Turners Dining room for breakfast was wonderful, cooked breakfast served to perfection. The bedrooms were beautifully arranged and spacious and spotlessly clean. The grounds and garden looked beautiful too even although it was mid November. We have already ear marked a date to return to this magnificent setting in County Kildare. This is not just a good Hotel, this is a jewel of a place to experience for a short stay.",5,2014,11,18
218,Wonderful Hotel,"I have stayed at this hotels on several occasions and it has never disappointed me. Great Location, comfortable bar, restaurant and rooms. Staff are always friendly and helpful. The food is great. My most recent stay was Saturday the 15th of November for the Annual Travel Centres Conference, a great night was had by all. The only downside is the lack of phone reception in the rooms making it impossible to make a call from your mobile.",4,2014,11,18
218,1st class,"I had the pleasure of staying for 3 days recently on a business trip. The hotel from the grounds to the rooms are very well kept. Staff where very friendly and helpful and the food both breakfast and dinner was fantastic, overall a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend.",5,2014,11,16
218,Lovely relaxing stay,"Stayed here with my partner for a weekend away last month. When we arrived at hotel the girl at the hotel reception was extremely friendly and welcoming. She gave us some advice on things to do and places to eat around Naas. The hotel is very old fashioned but has a touch of elegance to it which is what I really liked about the hotel. Rooms are quite big and spacious. The bed is so big and comfortable. We had dinner at Jacks Bar and it was very nice. Jacks Bar is modern compared to the rest of the hotel and it has a nice relaxing warm feeling to it. We also enjoyed a spa package and the spa is top class. The girl that looked after me for all of my treatments was extremely friendly and polite and she made me feel very relaxed. We also visited the gym/pool for an hour on one of the days and the gym is a class gym.  My only one complaint - there were working guys out on a cherry picker beside our room one of the mornings and the machinery was constantly making beeping noises for a few hours, it was a bit annoying to listen to them noises when you're trying to relax in bed. So with that aside we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Defo visit the spa if you are staying at hotel you won't be disappointed.",4,2014,11,12
218,Charming Hotel,"I've stayed at this hotel quite a few times on business and  its fantastic. Interesting location, great food, well stocked bar and with a really good gym next door. The grounds are worth walking round too as they are well maintained and vast.",5,2014,11,05
218,"Bright staff, dark decor","Made an overnight stop here, having booked a day earlier. This is a huge old hotel in its own extensive grounds with lots of car-parking space. The reception area is like a baronial hall, but the receptionists are warm and welcoming, giving guests detailed instructions on how to find their rooms. 
Ours was quite comfortable (excellent large bed), but for some reason we had been allocated one with a bathroom for disabled people: this was quite cramped for space, there was no bath, the off-putting shower was a plastic-matted floor section surrounded by plastic curtains on a rail, and the WC bowl was jammed against the sink, which was in an awkward corner.
The view from the room (301) was non-existent unless you like looking at the hotel extension out of one window, or the back entrance to the kitchens from the other. The décor of the room – as in the rest of the hotel – was dark, with heavy curtains and vinyl wallpaper in various shades of olive green or beige. Public spaces were similarly decorated and upholstered – but they were being enjoyed by children who found the long corridors and several stairs made an ideal playground.
We had to go out that night, (didn’t sample Jack’s Bar food which looked nice) and on returning found the car-park area totally lacking in lighting.
Breakfast was a high point. There was a good, varied range of food, and the service staff were excellent.
Good for an overnight stop if you’re stuck.",3,2014,11,04
218,Nice hotel but missing the wow factor,"reception was good.  The rooms are a little dated and not really for a 4 star standard.  

Had dinner in Jack’s bistro and the food and service were excellent. Rob was very good. 

Had to ring reception at around 1am and it rang out twice then two more times the night porter just hung up.  Finally got through on my fifth try.  Luck it was not a medical emergency – poor and worrying 

Over all a nice stay – if I was in the area I might stay again",3,2014,11,04
218,Lovely Hot with lots of character!!,"Just returned after staying with our 14yr old daughter. Very impressive exterior and the gardens are lovely for a stroll after breakfast. The receptionist was very welcoming and efficient. Our room was large, spotlessly clean and had a lovely view over the gardens. The whole place is beautiful, from the impressive staircases, numerous chandeliers, enormous communal areas,  to the quaint sitting rooms in the old part of the hotel, the atmosphere is homely and relaxing.Breakfast cooked to order and served promptly on an very hot plate and everything was delicious. Our daughter choose the pancakes and they too were perfect. The location was good and we were able to reach Dublin in about 30mins.Also handy to The National Stud, Newbridge Silver and Kildare Village Outlet, all of which we visited. We will definately be back.",5,2014,11,01
218,3 and a half would be more accurate,"We enjoyed our stay, booked with a travelzoo voucher! but wouldn't have liked to have paid more than the £85 we were charged for one night bed and breakfast. Rooms are grand, the communal areas a bit unusual with modern mixed with old and traditional. It gives the feel that it is trying to upgrade. It is enormous and we had to walk miles to our room including going up a staircase, across and then down again????  Staff are very helpful and friendly. The spa is very dated but I had a wonderful treatment from Amy, as good as you would get anywhere, she was very professional. The pool area was grand. Everywhere is spotlessly clean. Breakfast was not great and we are in Jacks on one evening which was just ok also. there are lovely walks and the hotel is located just outside the town and is in a quiet spot.  Not sure I would return but I know some guests raved about it.  It certainly was good value.  I felt slightly ripped off when I didn't get a ten euro  discount on my spa treatment, as per my voucher, as it was an autumn offer. Wifi was free and faultless.  We had a good time all things considered.",4,2014,10,31
218,a relaxing family time,"We spent 2 nights in this hotel during the half term break. The first thing that we thought was that it was huge however this also meant plenty of space for the kids to run about! the rooms were big with an extra bed brought it at no extra charge. the staff were really helpful and the icing on the cake was the cinema night held every evening at 730 with an endless supply of (free) popcorn, milky ways, smarties and juice...this was in one of the suites and as the receptionist said ""the parents can relax with a drink in the lounge outside""...perfect!!
The  breakfast was cooked to order and a good selection of fruits cereals danish pastries, juice etc. I'm obviously not the only one that thinks that this hotel is great....it was busy (although not noisy) which I think is the best sign that that this is an excellent hotel to stay in for a family break. we cant wait to have an excuse to return.",5,2014,10,31
218,Sheer heaven - gorgeous historic hotel made sublime by simply sensational service and super food too!,"We had been longing to visit Killashee House Hotel for quite some time so when the opportunity finally presented itself we just jumped for joy. My husband is always harder to impress than I am but even he was blown away, not just by the lovely hotel and wonderful grounds but really by the amazing service which was really by far the best ever.

It began with a super friendly, efficient and speedy check in with the charming Michelle (Royal) who assigned us the most fabulous suite in the Belling wing, then we were personally escorted to breakfast the next day by  Michael, the manager,  who happened upon us as we, with our famous lack of navigation skills, blundered about trying to find our way to the restaurant.

We were welcomed into the gorgeous dining room (see pic) by the lovely Liz and then treated to a fabulous breakfast with super cheerful and helpful glamorous Louise who really made our day by spoiling us royally with her outstanding hospitality skills and making our meal so special. Really we have never been made to feel so welcome and at home and thanks also to Allan in the restaurant and Carolyn at reception who were also so kind and charming to us.

Our suite was everything we could have wanted and so much more. It was huge with grand entrance hall with gorgeous antique armoire elegant  sitting room with TV and sofa and armchairs table and desk, vast and most gracious bedroom again with tv and fabulous giant antique bed (see photo ) armchairs, beautiful lamps and table, beautiful botanical pictures (see photo) and the most lavish marbled bathroom with gorgeous walk in shower with spa head and super water pressure, jacuzzi bath, twin wash hand basins and lovely lighting and spa toiletaries including conditioner which I am always so grateful for. All was super swish and stylish filled with fabulous antique furniture and all freshly decorated with heavy tassled curtains and freshly decorated with crisp caramel and cream striped wall paper, light cappuccino ceilings toning carpets  and di I mention the amazing bronze and crystal chandeliers in each room (see pic).

The bed was so so so comfortable and as we both are sometimes crippled by hotel beds it was such a joy to find this one even more comfortable than our own. I was not surprised when I cheekily undressed the bed to find it was indeed one of the fabulous King Koil Klub Klass matresses that we fell in love with when we first encountered one in The Riverside Court Hotel in Enniscorthy and we now have made it our mission to get one as our next mattress at home as we have never slept better.

Breakfast was a triumph with super selection cold buffet and of cooked to order menu including Eggs Benedict (my favourite when able to swap the ham for smoked salmon and transform it into Eggs Royale as I did on both mornings!), fresh mackeral and poached eggs, pancakes, a fabulous full irish Breakfast and many other lovely dishes.

Fruit juices included pineapple, which was a nice change of pace and for me the highlights were the gorgeous brown soda bread which was irrisistably morish especially when toasted; the FABULOUS creamy porridge which has to be tasted to be believed and indeed is so rich and luxurious it deserves more or a title such as Queen of porridge as so very much more delicious than the average porridge; the hollandaise sauce which came with the eggs benedict and the Greek Yoghurt which came in two of my most favourite and unusual flavours Gooseberry (do not think I have ever had a gooseberry yoghurt before) and rhubarb.

We were in heaven and my husband was so impressed he dashed out to tell the ever patient Michelle who at this stage had her ear worn off by our ecstatic praise of the hotel, food and service!

The first day we were there it was super rainy and we were super lazy and indeed ensconced in the wonderland of our amazing suite we could hardly be blamed for just cocooning up for the day and resisting the lure of the excellent gym/ leisure centre and award winning spa and enjoying the super fast free wi-fi ....  but the next day was fine so we set about walking the exquisite grounds and burn off some of those decadent breakfasts.

This has to be one of our best and most luxurious and romantic mini breaks ever and although my photos really do not do justice to this gorgeous hotel I have included just a couple to give an inkling of just how wonderful this hotel is - though as I mentioned before it is really and truly the staff and the amazing service that make this hotel so exceptional.

If you are looking for a special treat - if you LOVE spa breaks or romantic weekends away or just want to relax recharge the batteries in gorgeous surroundings and get treated like kings why not spoil yourself and book in for a minibreak at the gorgeous and luxurious Kilashee House Hotel, I know we will be counting the days to our next visit.

Thanks again to Michelle, Michael, Louise, Liz, Allan and Carolyn and everyone else at Kilashee House Hotel for giving us a magical and unforgetable luxury minibreak of a lifetime - we both feel ten years younger and ten pounds heavier thanks to all the good food and amazingly relaxing and elegant surroundings and constant spoiling! 

WOW we will never forget what an amazing amazing gorgeous time we had - just like a second mini-honeymoon more than a mini break - just fabulous A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

218,Beautiful lovely hotel!,"Stayed two nights in Killashee for a friends wedding. Dinner was included in my first nights stay and it was delicious..I couldnt have all 3 courses as I was stuffed. The hotel is GORGEOUS and the reception and restaurant staff are very nice, friendly and helpful. Its the perfect location for a wedding. The room was lovely and had everything I could need.Breakfast and our wedding meal were also fab...great customer service felt so welcome there. I could live there....",5,2014,10,28
218,Fantastic!,"Recently stayed at Killashee house hotel for the first time with my husband and 2 children it was a wonderful experience, Centrally located but still felt like you were away form everything, The staff were wonderful to us and could not be more helpful. The rooms and dining areas a spotless. The whole hotel had a lovely atmosphere. We would have no hesitation in recommending this to friends and family and will definitely return.",4,2014,10,28
218,"Amazing,","Fantastic venue, staff are so friendly, polite, nothing is too much to ask.  The Gym and swimming pool are spotless,  Rooms are spacious beds are comfortable.. just one slight room for improvement.. a plug at the bedside would have been good to charge phone at night.  Highly recommend",5,2014,10,26
218,A weekend to remember,"This is a super hotel, spacious well decorated spotlessly clean only 30 minutes from Dublin. We stayed here for 2 nights recently and the service at all times was excellent. We had a very happy family function and were looked after throughout so well by all the staff.. The bar on Friday night was very busy so a great atmosphere abounded but there was no shortage of staff to look after us all. The meal in Jack's bar was delicious and despite the volume of people eating on that evening our food arrived in good time. 
The morning after some of us eat in the breakfast room, others in our rooms. again a great selection was on offer ( the pancakes are yum !) Our meal on Saturday afternoon was excellent, served so promptly to over 160 of us ( a wedding ) and oh the quality of the table linen and cutlery/glassware was excellent. this hotel deserves the star rating . Well done to the staff on the day and my thanks to all who contributed to a fantastic weekend. We spent time in kilashee before and we will definitely return. Five star treatment. Thank you all so much.",5,2014,10,22
218,Spa Treatment,"I recently went for a Autumn treatment. The Spa is beautiful, very relaxing, the staff were so friendly, the girl who looked after me was Amy, and a lovely girl, and so good at her job, felt brilliant after my treatment, will definitely be going back there.",5,2014,10,18
218,"Just OK, over priced and over rated.","This was a just OK weekend away with a club.  The hotel is looking a little rough around the edges decor wise and we had to tolerate a really noisy wedding which went on until the early hours.
The saving grace for the weekend was the food which was excellent.  We had two dinners and they were just fabulous.  The breakfast was not so good and if there is a next time I'll have a lay in.  Staff were very pleasant.  Lots of kids running around the place which is about the norm for an Irish hotel.",3,2014,10,15
218,Lack of customer service,What can1 say really say I left my iPad charger there 2 weeks ago and still getting no where. There appears to be so many managers that never discuss anything hence this review is the only hope I have that maybe the general manager might enquire as to what is story is. Sad really that I feel I have no other way of being heard.,3,2014,10,08
218,Individual pampering plus group delights,"I had a wonderful trip to the Killashee House Hotel with a group of 25 friends. The hotel was ideal for a spot of individual pampering with a spa package costing 60 euro. I had a wonderful jet bath treatment followed by a soothing message. There were so many different options for the large group to gather in small or large groups. Staff were so accommodating for a gaggle of ladies from their 30s to their 80s who all enjoyed the food, drink and surrounding gardens. It was only an overnight stay but it felt like a full weekend away.",4,2014,10,08
218,Birthday treat,"Stayed in Killashee House Hotel last Friday, check in was speedy and pleasant, room was lovely as usual (this is our 2nd time to stay here). Food was amazing and woman who served us (older looking lady) was extremely friendly and efficient. Beautiful gardens around the house and we were lucky with the weather to spend some time there.",5,2014,10,07
218,Spacious hotel with a nice atmosphere,"I spent four nights here at a conference.  The hotel is nice and spacious and the rooms are very spacious also.  Food was good for the evening meal, breakfast not quite so good.  Staff friendly and helpful.
Decor was traditional to the point of being old fashioned.
The hotel has some nice gardens around it though the hotel itself isn't particularly pretty.",4,2014,10,04
218,Lovely hotel full of atmosphere,"I recently stayed here for one night and was allocated a room in the original part of the hotel. The room was up several flights of stairs and was tricky to find initially. The decor was old style but lovely, apart from the curtains which are coming apart in places! I had the luxury of a separate living room but it could do with a bit of an update as it had mismatched furniture and an old TV. One of lights didn't work and the external door to the bedroom didn't feel very secure. The room did have a lovely view of the gardens though.

Dinner that night was in Jacks bar which is very trendy and a bit of a contrast to the rest of the hotel. Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Dessert was an apple pie and was stodgy and not very good. Breakfast had the usual choices although I don't recall seeing any fresh fruit.

I found the reception staff standoffish and distant. Restaurant staff were very friendly. I would probably return to the hotel as I didn't get using their leisure or spa facilities. It is within travelling distance to Kildare shopping outlet which is worth a visit ",4,2014,10,02
218,"A nice, but unusual hotel.","Once we eventually found the hotel (it isn't easy to find using sat-nav), we were pleasantly surprised by the impressive building at the end of a long drive, surrounded by manicured grounds.

The interior design of the hotel is a little unusual, a mixture of grand decor and modern cheese (think Las Vegas) in places.

The reception staff were pleasant and welcoming but a little uninformative, as they failed to mention the free bus to the races despite knowing the purpose for our visit.  We would have saved money had we known.

The room was incredibly spacious, so much so we each had a double bed to ourselves!

Unfortunately, the food left a lot to be desired.  I normally eat anything and everything, but it was the first time (possibly ever) that I left a lot of it.  As for breakfast, this was the one meal of the day I really enjoyed, however, if you want a well done egg with hard yolk, you're out of luck, as I never got one, despite repeatedly sending my order back.  The staff were lovely and helpful, though.",4,2014,09,30
218,A Lovely Hotel.,"We stayed at the Killashee for the Race and Stay Package, what a lovely hotel, a little shabby in places but that added to the charm.  We ate in Turners on our first night, the food was exceptionally good and the waiting staff were lovely.  We also ate in Jacks which was great.  The breakfasts, as others have said were excellent.  We will definitely be back again soon.

Two staff members really made our stay, Louise on reception, who really went the extra mile, she found out one morning we were going to the Kildare Shopping Outlet and immediately gave us a 10% off all the shops voucher, so thoughtful.  Also, Alan, who chauffeured us to each days racing, a great driver, but also really entertaining, my husband enjoyed swapping racing tips with him as well as cow breeding tips!

All in all a thoroughly lovely stay and one which will be repeated soon, thank you.",5,2014,09,30
218,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for an over night stay deal room b&b and an evening meal, hotel is lovely, grounds a lovely nice to have a little stroll around. Reception is lovely and staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are big two large double beds + the rooms are clean. We had a 4 course meal in jacks bar and the food was really delicious, we stayed on in the bar after our dinner as their was entertainment.",4,2014,09,27
218,Fine Dining Escape,"Stayed overnight on a Saturday for their fine dining escape and all I can say is"" wow"". 
Check in fast and pleasant. I have mobility issues and I had asked for a room near reception and the lift, which was no problem.
Stayed on the third floor in the Graydon wing. Room was very large with a good sized bathroom and was spotless. Bed was extremely comfortable and the view was over the gardens.
The only gripe I had was, that after walking through the corridors following the signs for the leisure centre, we exited a door to find it was a separate building about 30 yards from the hotel.
As for the food, the dinner was fine dining at its best. Superb ingredients, expertly cooked, presented and served.
Breakfast the next morning was cooked to order and was the best full Irish I've ever had. The buffet had all the cereals, juices, pastries, meats, cheeses etc.
I couldn't recommend highly enough.",5,2014,09,22
218,"Top service, great hotel","Stayed in the Killashee for one night in July while attending a wedding. Our room was extremely large and the bed, included spacious bathroom with separate shower and bath. The bed was extremely comfy. The hotel staff could not be more courteous or helpful, from the team at the reception desk to the staff at breakfast time. Often at weddings the meal can be standard fare but at Killashee, the meal was just excellent. The hotel provides a wide variety of options at breakfast, from choice of yoghurt, selection of prepared fresh fruits, breads, preserves etc, but we opted for an excellent full irish. The hotel has a separate snug bar away from the main bar and it's a lovely cosy spot. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider booking again for a nice getaway

218,Great wedding venue,"We got married in Killashee House Hotel in May 2014 and had an amazing day. From the first day when we met with Katie the wedding co-ordinator to view the hotel we couldn’t have asked for better service. Both of the wedding co-ordinators, Katie and Lisa were on-hand to help us every step of the way as we planned our big day. The service we received from all of the hotel staff on the day itself was top class. In particular, Max, the duty manager on the day was great. He was there from the moment we arrived until we moved to the residents bar at the end of the night and made sure everything ran like clockwork on the day. The food was superb and we received so many great comments and feedback on the food, service and the hotel in general from our wedding guests. We would have no hesitation in recommending Killashee as a wedding venue to anyone who is considering it. The staff are a pleasure to deal with and we look forward to a return stay.

Mr & MRs Fagan",5,2014,09,17
218,Return visit,"As planned I returned to this hotel for another visit accompanied by two friends who were there for their first visit.
We planned and booked afternoon tea and what a treat this turned out. It was the most delicious afternoon tea we have ever had. Sandwiches were open and the fillings were delicious. One friend who joined us is vegetarian and her sandwiches were so tasty ,we all had to try  and were very impressed. Scones were delicious, served with butter, cream and gorg jam. Cakes were  varied and irresistible and a very delightful dessert completed our cake stand. Staff were so attentive, bringing fresh pots of tea as we needed.i would recommend this as a very special treat at this hotel.  We had only a small snack in the dining room later as that afternoon tea was so good.
After a delicious breakfast we explored the lovely grounds around the hotel. They are beautifully maintained, the Butterfly Garden was particularly attractive as lovely flowers attracted many varieties of butterflies, even in September.
We had a very tasty snack lunch, soup and bread but gave in to a shared sweet platter to finish.
Dinner was in Jacks Bar and was a wonderful success for each of us. delicious starters mains and desserts and coffee. This meal was served by the kindest most attentive staff one could ever wish to have. The supervisor in the dining room Aneta looks after all diners and her staff have been so well trained to do the same. My friends were very impressed and like me would love to return.
I can only say that from the moment one arrives, being greeted by pleasant  reception staff and helpful advice on hotel dining times and spa bookings if requested, each guest is made to feel very special.
I loved my second visit and I look forward to the next one. Three days is a wonderful refreshing treat and it is made so special by this most interesting hotel.
Thank you to everyone at Killashee House Hotel for looking after us so well. We loved our visit.",4,2014,09,11
218,"Lovely Hotel, Great Food","Stayed at the Kilashee House Hotel for 1 night, September 2014. Hotel is lovely and clean, with a period feeling carrying through from the original house. As we stayed on a Sunday it was pretty quiet with the upstair bar remaining closed and no live entertainment in the main restaurant, which was a shame. 
The room was nice, nothing extravagant with a lame view out of the window. Bath fills incredibly quickly and I was mere seconds away from flooding the entire room so do not leave the bath to fill unadvised. Water was great, nice and hot! Beds comfortable with nice soft, clean sheets. 

We took the casual dining and stay package. Food in Jacks was delicious! Particularly the pork starter!! Was a great size and incredibly tasty, all elements on the plate complimenting one another. I followed with the steak which was cooked to perfection. We then shared a chocolate taste plate and cheese platter. Unfortunately, no drinks were included in the dine package which is a shame. Even one glass of wine per person would really round the evening off nicely

Good location & friendly staff",4,2014,09,10
218,Great place not too far from Dublin,"I sometimes despair of a Irish hotels but enjoyed our stay here .We were here for a wedding ( food wonderful ,,everything went smoothly etc. ) and there were two weddings on the Friday and another two the next day ,The hotel is big enough to absorb the weddings but due to layout you do not feel you are stuck in a corner somewhere . Recommend it highly if you have a car and visiting Dublin , you can go off for the day and come home to this nice old fashioned vibe .It was a shooting lodge , then a school so it can be a bit like the Harry Potter school but that's a nice feature too and you soon find your way .Some nice little bars / coffee arrows tucked away in corners .Will go back for a weekend in the winter , enjoy the gardens and big open fires.Staff very friendly and helpful .",4,2014,09,05
218,Enjoyable night away,"I stayed here for a night on the august bank holiday weekend for my anniversary with my Boyfriend using a fantastic deal we got.
This is the second time we have stayed here the first being for my Boyfriends Brothers wedding in October which was a fabulous occasion and enjoyed by all. This time round we where able to enjoy the facilities more hence the review now and not then.

The rooms are comfortable and very big a little dated but it goes with the hotel if they where very modern thy would just seem out of place. We had 2 double bed which I find a little odd(we only need one!)it was the same when we stayed for the wedding so I'm guessing this is the case in most standard rooms. The shower was nice and hot and with good pressure. There was a dvd player with the tv which we always appreciate as we love our movies. The only criticism with the rooms is that there is no mini fridge/mini bar which would have come in handy to keep the refreshments had brought with us(ie water bottles).

We had dinner in the bar where the staff where very friendly and efficient in particular the waitress we had i didn't get her name but she was middle aged and non Irish national. Really lovely. The food was delicious we enjoyed the soup, chicken wings, burgers and coffee. We then relaxed in the bar with a few drinks on the comfortable couches. 

We didn't use the spa but it looked lovely we used the pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna which where lovely as where  the changing rooms(the womens was however my boyfriend didn't seem too impressed with the men's he said it didn't have many showers) 

The breakfast room was quite busy so we had a little bit of a wait but that was okay with us- we enjoyed a nice breakfast(full Irish) that was brought to our table. 

A long review but an enjoyable stay. We will defiantly return and recommend to friends ",5,2014,09,04
218,Superb Hotel,"Stayed  in hotel for 2 nights, its what dreams are made of. Staff are so courteous and helpful and good humoured, they ensure everyones comfort at their ease, nothing is too much trouble.  The
food was excellent and everything hot.  Grounds are magnificent, just like the hotel its superb.  The Hotel is very well maintained both inside and outside. Our room was  tastefully decorated , very comfortable with a lovely view, very spacious and spotless.  We thoroughly enjoyed the swimming pool and spa area and will have some treatments on our next visit.  Its Irish Hospitality
at its best.  Keep up the good work as they do an excellent job.  Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2014,09,03
218,Fabulous!!,"I absolutely loved staying here.  We got to experience a few different bedroom styles since we were part of a wedding party.  They are all incredible and each unique.  The hotel is stunning with high ceilings, intricate moldings and fireplaces everywhere.  They have an Irish bar with authentic snug in the back.  The food was fantastic and service wonderful.  The grounds are beautiful with butterfly garden, fountain and gazebos.  Perfect for photos.  You have to experience this place.  I will stay there whenever I can in the future.  What a treat!!",5,2014,09,02
218,"Beautiful , Tranquil Hotel","Stayed in this beautiful hotel for two nights and I could have stayed for much longer. The hotel is spotlessly clean, our room was spacious and bed very comfortable everything was at your hand including a kettle to make a cup of tea if needed.
The gardens surrounding the hotel were so lovely and very well kept (a beautiful place for some quiet time)
Jacks bar is an ideal place to have some really good food and a relaxing drink and a big thank you to the lovely member of staff  Annette from Poland who was so pleasant and helpful at giving us the fantastic history to this beautiful stately house the night before we left.
I cannot fault anything about this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice break away in  charming surroundings.",5,2014,09,02
218,Our trip,"Whilst we were there we found out the the Hotel had been sold. So the dreams of the former owner lost in the crash may well be fulfilled. There is good potential for instance a golf course and some historic ruins.
It is a large function type hotel with a health club which certainly attracts members from far and wide.
Breakfast was not inspirational but the dinner was an improvement with good fish. The Irish take vegetables seriously.
The room was vast with two double beds.
This is the destination hotel of people in the area but as visitors without needs beyond a quiet room, breakfast and perhaps a dinner it was more than we needed.
The planted gardens were well maintained and do deserve praise.",4,2014,09,01
218,Wedding Party,We stayed for a wedding the food was great the staff were excellent could not do enough for you.The room was lovely and the grounds and the spa and the leisure center was great. Would have no problem in recommending this Hotel to anyone.,5,2014,08,31
218,Bar food,Ate in bar for first time.was very disappointing. Had thai curry.it was really lovely but the portion was served in what can only be described as a baby bowl.it was very expensive 17 euro.very poor value for money.deserts and starters were outrageous. The staff were lovely. Grounds and hotel are lovely but hotel really needs to address bar food issue.,3,2014,08,30
218,Fantastic hotel & first class Spa....,Visited hotel and was really impressed with the staff here....they offer first class service are friendly and very accommodating.  It was my friends 50th birthday and we  celebrated by having dinner in the hotel and several treatments in the spa.   A special mention to Michael on reception as he organised my friends 50th birthday celebrations...and all the staff sang happy birthday to her too....a really nice touch was the chocolate piped happy birthday plate.  food was exceptional served promptly and professionally....would have liked to try restaurant but it only opens at weekends but food in the ambient bar was just as special.  We booked the summer indulgence spa package which was great value and enjoyed the perfect treatments including exfoliation massage floatations bed and facial scalp massage....all so relaxing in beautiful immalculate surroundings....a special thanks and mention to the very knowledgeable Amy there she knows her stuff were products are concerned and gave good advice and just the perfect therapist...can see why she is the Supeervisor there.  All in all this hotel is ideal...not too far from the nice wee town of Naas and close to the national stud and Kildare shopping village. The hotel grounds and butterfly garden is so relaxing and well kept....as is the lovely relaxing bar for drinks or food. Def recommend this hotel and spa....it's a must if visiting Kildare.,5,2014,08,30
218,family break,"we stayed here during summer holiday. 
they had a great family offer so there were a lot of families at the hotel.but the pace was never too busy nor noisy except for the swimming pool and the bar at tea time. 
but the swimming pool has set time for adult only, so you can choose quiet time if you want to. also you can book table for tea so you dont have to wait too long for your tea. the only thing is that they only had bistro bar open during our stay, no other bars or restaurant which was a bit dissapointing. 
dinner, afternoon tea, breakfast were all great at good price. specially the afternoon tea was really good fun for all the family.

our room must have been the very basic room for the price we paid, but it was big, clean and comfortable. a bit of a walk to the room from reception and specially from the gum/spa area which was all fun going up and down looking at nice paintgs on the walks. we thought a net curtains will be nice as our window was facing the deliverly area and just at the hight of lotty drivers window! 

the hotel building is beautiful and they have nice big garden to walk about.
you can walk into the town (under 30mins) and get taxi easily on the way back if you want to. 
lots of things to see and do with children nearby.
lovely people working at the hotel, and we met lots of kind and friendly local people using the pool at the hotel and in the town and attractions around the town. 
we had a very good family break.",4,2014,08,29
218,Lovely building and grounds. Bar food not 4 star,"Had lunch in Killashee today. Indeed, have had lunch here many times because of its proximity to Naas. This is  rated as a four star Hotel. So, is it fair to expect a doorman in a four star Hotel? I think so. What about drinks being carried on a tray and coasters being provided rather than glasses being carried by servers? Is it reasonable to expect non-stinky toilets? Definitely.
Well, on every occasion I've visited, without exception, the gents toilets stink. The smell even carries to the downstairs lobby where the ""restrooms"" are located. I don't expect this in any Hotel and definitely not in a four star Hotel. We're talking about basic hygiene and cleanliness here. This is not too much to ask in the 21st century! Use a power hose!
Why is there no doorman? Go to any four star Hotel and there is always someone to open the door and greet you.
The staff are friendly and courteous and very obliging. However, when it comes to serving a glass of wine, please use a tray and don't carry the glass as if it was a diner!
Now, what about the prices? Well, certainly, the prices are four star. Can you believe that Breaded Plaice could cost €17.90 (lunch)? The side orders of peas and chips cost €4 a piece! So, that was €25.90 for one main course - definitely a four star price, not four star food. It was good average food - nothing exceptional for the price. A Club Sandwich cost €11.50 and t two soups cost €9.80! Incredible! 
I do not regard the prices here as competitive at all. It seems to me that everything on the menu is over-priced and not worth the money. Go to a Carvery somewhere else and get better value for your money.",3,2014,08,28
218,Beautiful grounds with outstanding service!,"We got married in Killashee House last week and we were completely thrilled with everything. The house and surroundings are immaculate and the rooms are spacious with beautiful ornate furniture! The service we recieved before, during and after the wedding was exceptional. The wedding team helped us all along the wedding planning path and on the day the duty manager was professional and courteous. All of our guests remarked on the dinner service being excellent (have family in similar industry!) and the food was fantastic, exactly what we ordered! Honestly, we could not have asked for a better day and had not one complaint about Killashee!! Thank you Killashee...",5,2014,08,26
218,overpriced food,"Had lunch today in bar with family, first visit here . The food was only ok, we had one desert platter costing 9e, four tiny portions tasty, but not worth the price.  I do not understand how you can justify the prices for such mediocre food, really bad value. Staff and service were great",3,2014,08,24
218,a great place to stay,We spent a very enjoyable 2 nights in this fabulous hotel on 21-08-14 and 22-08-14. Staff were friendly food was great and the rooms were lovely' We based ourselves  in this hotel and traveled into Dublin for the 2 days. This worked out a treat,5,2014,08,22
218,Nice place,"We spent a night at Killashee House Hotel on a B&B + dinner package. The staff was friendly and dinner / breakfast very nice.
I put 4 stars only as we forgot an important item in the room and after searching for it for a whole week, we decided as a last resort to call the hotel to check if they had it. We obviously expected that the hotel would have contacted us if they had found it.
It turns out that they did have it and we were quite disappointed that they didn't let us know  despite having our contact details.
It is lucky that we didn't live too far and could come down to collect it.",4,2014,08,22
218,excellent service,"I attended a wedding in Killashee house hotel yesterday 20th August 2014. 
The food was excellent and the service was really good. The staff were very helpful and friendly. 
As I work in the cathering industry myself I always observe whats going on around me, one paticular waitress stood out, her name was Alison,, what a fantastic worker.even though she was extremley busy, she still made time to smile and chat while serving.
She was on the go all evening.Alison was also the on the breakfast shift this morning and again was extremely efficient and friendly. 
I will definitely be back.

218,Killashee pluses and minuses,"(+) Friendly staff, great food, quiet/clean/pleasant/good size room, excellent grounds.

(-) Weddings can get loud and go on late, No room air conditioning, satellite TV, or USB plugs.

All-in-all a very nice stay and I would recommend this hotel.",4,2014,08,21
218,Very average hotel,"This hotel has the potential to be amazing but it's very disappointing. Driving in it looks impressive, then you look a little closer & it is in fact incredibly shabby. Windows badly need to be repainted & cleaned. The paving outside is dangerously uneven & protruding at angles, I was very lucky not to fall badly when I tripped on a loose paving stone. 
The interior isn't much better. Broken tiles, wallpaper starting to peel in places, handrails on stairs grubby, tables not cleaned of empty glasses & cups for ages, old fashioned rooms & windows which wouldn't close properly & still were draughty when it appeared to be fully closed. 
The service was diabolical. I have nothing against young people working but the disinterest & sulky attitudes shown were astounding for a hotel claiming to be a four star establishment. 
The food was probably the most bland & tasteless I have ever had the misfortune of eating. We dined in jacks bar during our stay & I definitely wouldn't be recommending it to anyone. I tried a variety of dishes during our stay & there genuinely wasn't one meal I could say I enjoyed. 
Im told the hotel is in financial hardship at the moment & it really shows in my opinion. As disappointing as I found it to be I can see there is huge potential there. 
I won't be rushing back anytime soon & I certainly won't be recommending it to anyone, however, I do look forward to when things are back on track & I will have no problem giving it another chance then.",2,2014,08,19
218,Room for improvement,Staff were very friendly and we had our 7 month old with us and they supplied travel cot for us which a lot of places don't do..Reception staff very friendly. Grounds round hotel very nice and well kept. Location is good just on edge of Dublin and only 20mins from Kildare outlet centre. Room old fashioned but nice view out onto garden..Got room service one night and it was very prompt which was good.Got breakfast in bed 1 morning with 2 surcharge of €10 for same..Very disappointed with this as we paid over 300 for 2 nights but that's just the world we live in now I suppose..Not impressed with bathroom.Very old fashioned with old shower in bath setup.In my opinion needs to be updated but limited space to do that. Lay out of hotel all over place..The halls I found them rather murky and dilapidated.. Carpets rising on edges are an accident and claim waiting to happen. Gym and pool nice but you share it with public and found this a bit of a turnoff as pool packed when we went in.Also had to leave pool as it was Baltic cold and child crying it was so cold. This hotel has potential but needs more refurbishment esp in bathrooms.Despite all that we still had a nice stay for 1st time away with baby.,3,2014,08,19
218,A grand weekend,"Just back from Killashee House Hotel after a most enjoyable weekend. A warm welcome from knowledgeable staff, already busy with the registering of wedding guests, gave us a nice feeling about this hotel.. Our hearts sank a bit as previous encounters in hotels hosting weddings have been more than disappointing. However Killashee kept the two weddings in separate wings and we were blissfully unaware of the other hotel occupants- except for a rude outburst in our corridor at 5.00am next day and the unfortunate setting off of a fire alarm. High jinks... but annoying for other folk.
Our junior suite was superb. So much space and each item of classic furniture fitted into the theme of an old 'castle'. All the fittings in the spacious bathroom were spotless and functioned to perfection. Indeed it was one of the best showers we have enjoyed in a long time! The four poster bed was very comfortable and the draperies were stylish- and clean! We enjoyed spending time in the room-unlike other breaks when the best plan was to leave the room as soon as possible. 
The Dinner in Turner's Restaurant on Saturday was brilliant: a bounteous crab starter followed by decorative and delicious main courses. One of us could not have dessert- but the pannacotta was superb. The meal was served with immaculate efficiency by well trained staff. The wine list was good and well priced. Following dinner we went to the beautiful gardens to see Emily's butterfly garden in the failing light- a delight of flowers and shrubs.
Apart from the unfortunate 'wake up call' we had a peaceful night and were pleased to be able to eat a very good breakfast, again in the stylish dining room. There is a wide range of food items in the cooked breakfast menu and plenty of choice on the buffet. Amazing use of tablecloths! There must be a huge laundry bill. Our day was busy with a visit to the Japanese Gardens and National Stud nearby in Kildare. The Hotel has a deal with the venue for 10% off.
As the restaurant was not open on Sundays we took our evening meal in Jacks'bar.This is definitely a sports bar- rather gloomy, noisy and, with mainly hard surfaces, hard to hear one's companion. Our meal however was very good and the standard of service is to be commended. Tables are at a premium and I would suggest you book well ahead. This was our only criticism: a restaurant somewhere between the contrasting atmospheres of the fine dining room and the bar- a kind of bistro would be appreciated.The following evening passed without incident and we left after breakfast to enjoy the retail opportunities at Newbridge silver. For us the charming staff are the key to this hotel's success. The grand hall and gallery are not too daunting! There is a long 'Children's Charter' which sets out for all parents a clear set of house rules for behaviour. We suggested that the same be written up for the occasional, thoughtless wedding guest! This was a great 'staycation'.",5,2014,08,19
218,Killashee,"Stayed for 4 days at the Killashee house just outside Nass. Hotel was very good if a little worn in places but it was an old boarding school. Pool great for the kids but it lacked a good viewing area if you didn't fancy a swim. Bar and restaurant good and the snug bar was great but under used, Plenty of excellent lobby areas to sit and chill, read a book and guest watch. Breakfast was well organised and a good choice. Garden offered good exploring for the kids. Car parking close to the hotel was always busy. Staff were friendly and helpful.  Rooms were plenty big and beds very comfortable",4,2014,08,17
218,Always a great supporter but not anymore....,"So disappointing.Have been here many times in last few years.Have always recommended for lunch/dinner/afternoon tea but will not be recommending again.Attended here last Tuesday for afternoon tea and it was so disappointing.Staff were disinterested at best.Table was wobbly,when pointed out to staff she stuck a beer mat under and a 'that'll do '.Large piece of broken glass at my foot when I handed it to same staff she just took it,no apology.Afternoon tea took 50 mins to arrive.Orderd tea and coffee,tea arrived in a pot but a small coffee in a cup,when I asked for a warm top up it took 25 mins.No milk brought to table,again had to ask.A real feeling of lethargy and disinterest from staff.all sound like small things but just not enjoyable anymore.Never thought I would say this but give it a miss.Lots of new exciting options where staff still want to do their best.",2,2014,08,16
218,lost property,After leaving a parcel for family who were due to stay at the hotel for a few days the parcel contained some cards trinkets and photographs taken of the couple on there engagement which they were celebrating while staying at the hotel. the parcel never got to our family it went ( missing) never to be seen again we have been fobbed of with every excuse known to man and generally playing pass the book from the  duty manager to the hall porter and receptionist.we have been treated with a total lack of respect.I will not be giving any recommendation for this hotel .,1,2014,08,15
218,Lovely location,"I went here with my friend for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the stunning location this hotel is set in. In my opinion it would be a lovely place for a wedding reception.
The food I had was the prawn salad and my friend had the same which took a while to arrive considering it was only a salad. It was absolutely delicious though. I really enjoyed it.
The waiters are really friendly and helpful although one of the girls forgot we had asked for a coffee. We had to ask her again. 
When another waiter came down to give us the milk and sugar, there was a used lollipop stick on the saucer that the milk and sugar was resting on. When I pointed it out to my friend, the waiter didn't seem to take any notice and the stick stayed on the saucer.
Another small thing was there was toilet roll sticking out of one of the toilets which made me think someone hadn't been down to check them in a while.
These are just minor details that can be polished off in no time. 
Apart from that we had a lovely lunch and only took one star off because I think if these minor things were seen to, this would definitely be a 100% rating.
We would come back for lunch again.",4,2014,08,14
218,Just as good 2nd time around ,"After a lovely stay last year we decided to return for a weekend break again this month. Gorgeous dinner in jacks, walk round the grounds and butterfly garden and fab breakfast. Once again the staff couldn't do enough for us, housekeeping,  reception, waiting and leisure staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful. Hotel is very grand and in spite of its size, is incredibly clean and well maintained.
My little girl, now 17 months, was so well catered for and we have decided to make it a yearly (at least) visit for a family weekend! ",5,2014,08,13
218,Ok stay,"We stayed last week and enjoyed it but certain aspects of the stay I have to say disappointed us! The hotel is very nice if not a little but shabby at times but it adds to the charm. Staff at check in were very helpful and polite . 
The rooms very v nice  ,but  having to travel up two lifts to the room was a bit ""out there"" but you get used to it .
The downside was the expected entertainment was cancelled that night so it felt like a situation of all dressed up with no where to go!! The hotel was very quiet but apart from background music that was it!! 

The breakfast I have to say was horrible , the pancakes tasted raw and the yoghurt tasted gone off and combined with a tea pot that spilled half its contents on pouring I felt a bit fed up with the whole experience!!",3,2014,08,06
218,Romantic overnight stay,"We celebrated our parent's 50th wedding anniversary here a few years back and have been intending to have an overnight stay ever since.  We eventually got around to it last weekend. Although it took two lifts and about 5 mins of walking to get to our room we couldn't fault the room.  It was spotless and spacious. We had afternoon tea in Jack's restaurant and the scones are just delish.  If I was there again scones and tea/coffee would be more than enough (honestly the nicest choice from the afternoon tea). The package we booked also had dinner for two in Jack's and that was good but not great, minor issues with some of the food were just brushed aside by the waitress and not resolved.  Some staff definitely needed a refresher course on customer service.  We were billed for drinks we didn't get, this was sorted but would have easily gone unnoticed by the other half had he been signing for the bill.  I would stay again but I would choose a room in the old house and maybe try Turner's Restaurant instead.",3,2014,08,05
218,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"Visited for afternoon tea with a friend. Food was delicious and well presented. Loads of food for two people and great value at 15e each. Lovely atmosphere, staff were friendly and attentive. We sat for about 2 hours comfortably and felt very relaxed and no pressure to leave. Will definitely return!

My only very minor issue was the teapot which was a regular stainless steel pot. Considering the high standard presentation of everything else and that the tea is a focal part of the experience I would have liked a nicer tea pot!! But that's just nitpicking! ",5,2014,08,05
218,Perhaps Kildare's best mid-range hotel?,"There aren't many options when it comes to quality hotels in the Naas area but Killashee is an excellent place to stay. The rooms are furnished to a high standard and similar to the Shelbourne in style and feel. Staff courteous and friendly and the food was delicious. I had a steak as good as any I have had in recent times. All in all, good value for money and my first choice hotel for future visits to this area. ",4,2014,08,03
218,4 star letdown,Arrived on our midweek break...greeted by a less then friendly receptionist...went to our home was spacious...decor was a little old but we couldn't fault it..had lunch in the bar...food was lovely extremely fresh...as the restaurant wasn't open in the hotel we dined out both nights...went to bed that night to realise our window was broken ..that was ok until 5.30am came and deliveries started arriving below our window...very unimpressed...the hotel hosted a wedding the next day and you had to walk through the drinks reception to get to your room...that night say us been woke up numerous times to guests of the wedding banging and shouting...for such a spacious hotel you would think all wedding guests would be housed on a certain wing...breakfast both mornings was below a average and certainly not four star standard...don't think the photos are a proper description of the hotel and don't think we would ever come back...,3,2014,08,01
218,Lovely hotel,"I stayed at the Killashee House Hotel in July, with a group of friends, for my friends hen party.  Organising a group booking can be difficult, with many changes along the way, but Anita in Reservations couldn't have been more helpful.   Communication was professional and efficient and Anita left no stone un-turned to accommodate all of our needs.   Most of our group opted for the Dinner, B&B + 2 25min spa treatments, for €170 per person sharing.   
On arrival, we were impressed by the beautiful driveway and immaculate grounds.   Reception staff were friendly and efficient and offered porter service, which we declined.   It is quite a long walk to the bedrooms, but the architecture, furniture and decor more than make up for that.
Our dinner reservation was for 9pm and things ran a little late, but the restaurant staff were more than accommodating.   The food was superb, service was very efficient and attentive.   There was no pressure to leave the restaurant and as women do, we sat and chatted at our leisure until midnight.    There was some music in the bar, which was lovely.   
The rooms were large, beautifully furnished and comfortable.   The bride-to-be was upgraded to a complimentary suite, which had extra large bathroom, with jacuzzi bath, robes and slippers were provided.  
Breakfast on Sunday morning was served until 11am.   We all sat at a very large, round table, which was lovely.   The selection of cereals & fruits was excellent.   I ordered the full Irish breakfast, other options included omelettes, pancakes & fish.   It was lovely to be served a freshly cooked breakfast, rather than having to queue up for a buffet.   The brown bread was simply delicious.   Just like the previous night at dinner, the staff couldn't have been more helpful.   One of our party asked for a fresh cup of tea and within minutes, two fresh pots of tea and two of coffee arrived, together with clean cups.   
In the early afternoon, we sat outside on the terrace and had coffee, overlooking the beautiful gardens and the lovely fountain.   
Later, I headed to the leisure centre, which is in a separate building.   The pool is nice, but I have seen nicer leisure centres in spa hotels.   There were chairs and tables at either end of the pool-side if you wanted to sit down, but it was busy, families with children etc. so it didn't have the relaxing feel I have experienced in other hotels.   
I had booked a treatment and asked for a deep massage, having spoken with another guest in the bar the night before, who told me if I didn't ask for deep massage, it would be ""just a rub""!  Well, the massage was deep... I think the therapist used her elbows on my back which was uncomfortable at times but overall, a good massage.    I didn't have much time for the relaxation area as the spa was closing at six o clock but if you go there, watch out for the steps up to the relaxation couches on either side.  They really should put a luminous strip there, to alert patrons to the fact that there is a step.   I almost tripped and fell.   Another of our party actually did fall, which wasn't pleasant.   It could have been avoided by a little attention to detail.
We really enjoyed our stay at Killashee House Hotel.   The staff were outstanding and are to be commended on their efficient and friendly service.   The hotel was busy, but you'd never know it, because it is so spacious.   There are no bedrooms over the function rooms, which means no noise and the function rooms must sound-proofed because no noise seemed to carry into the corridors or the bar from the two weddings taking place on the Saturday night.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to enjoy a relaxing break and I look forward to visiting there again.   Well done to all concerned.",5,2014,07,26
218,Beautiful hotel ....step back to a more elegant age,Killashee House Hotel lived up to our expectations. It came highly recommended and was a perfect setting for our spa overnight stay. All our treatments were great especially the Hot Stone Massage. Dinner was really good and I recommend the duck and hake dishes. The gardens are well kept and we made uses of the swimming pool which is a short walk away from the main hotel...so you can't access this in your bath robe...especially if raining!  The Espa is also in this building. The reception staff were helpful as were the waiters ...the Baileys chocolate mousse was an instant hit! We will return again in October...,5,2014,07,21
218,Excellent,"Stayed in July as a family of 5.  Although there's a very good children's pool there is nothing else child specific at the hotel.  However despite that we all had a great break - lovely relaxed atmosphere with every member of staff we encountered friendly and helpful - beautifully maintained gardens and plenty of space around hotel and we had an excellent meal as well.  Spacious well furnished room and a good breakfast topped it all off (lack of HP sauce for the fry forgiveable!).  This would be a great location for a relaxing break as a couple.
Really excellent value all round.",5,2014,07,21
218,wonderful stay,"We recently stayed one night with spa treatments and a meal in restaurant,  Everything was perfect from car park , Check in, spa treatment and relaxation room, bedroom huge beds, gardens, lunch in bar, dinner in restaurant, and breakfast.  All staff were friendly and polite.  A charming old house with plenty of character in every room.  I will be back for a longer stay.",5,2014,07,20
218,Needs a little updating. ....,"Arrived as a guest for a wedding Reception and was checked in by a Female receptionist who's welcome was not very nice- no smiles or welcome, all I was asked was our name and told your room is that way and that will be 143euro. The receptionist gave us no information on breakfast times, checkout etc... which we had to find out from other guest, not a very pleasant person to have as the first point of contact for such a nice hotel. Our superior room was a long long was which we had to take a lift to floor 2 walk 2 very long corridors and then get into another lift and go to a second floor from there and 1 more very long corridor and finally we go to our room. The view from the corridor windows were awful looking down on bins and rubbish which looked like it has been there a long time but it does explain why there are netted curtins on every window. Our room was nice and clean with a big bathroom, separate bath and walk in shower and double sinks, pitty no robes or sippers provided for a superior room. The only 2 faults were the TV was a big old grey box with very few channels and the wall paper was badly marked. The white bed sheets could do with been replaced with new- fresh crisp sheets. Breaskfast was fantastic could not fault it. It was very hot and delicious with a great selection of fruits, yogurt,  pastries,  cerals etc the full breakfast- was sasuage, egg, bacon, mushrooms, fried potatoe, tomatoe, black and white pudding. The scrambled egg was the best I have ever tasted mmmmm. The gardens are beautiful but it was a pitty and some of the gates were pad locked so we could not enter not sure what the reason for that was. The front of the hotel badly needs to be looked at it looks very old and run down not what u would expect to see when driving up this lovely avenue, some of the windows to the front look like they have never been cleaned and alot of clutter in the windows.  I used the leisure centres pool, sauna,  steam room and jazzui and all were lovely and clean.",3,2014,07,19
218,A very pleasant stay,"We stayed here for 1 night earlier this week on a TravelZoo deal - an amazing £119 for dinner, bed and breakfast. 
Plus points -
The dinner was fantastic - we had the choice of the entire menu and the only supplement was 5 euros for the steak. Beautiful quality of food. There is certainly a chef here who understands flavour and presentation. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. 

Spacious and well decorated room. Particularly good bathroom with modern interior design.
 
Stunning grounds.

Very fast free wifi.

Negative points -
It is good that the swimming area has times when children are not allowed. However the staff should be more strict in ensuring that parents obey these timings. Children were not allowed in after 6.45pm however at exactly 6.45pm, a 3 yr old came in with his father. Rather than go to the children's pool (where he shouldn't even have been at this time), the father brought the child to the adult pool and started throwing the child in wearing his arm bands. Lots of shrieking followed. I would have liked for a member of staff to come in around 6.50pm to check that all children were out of the pool. This would have taken 1 min but would have meant that all the adults would have had a peaceful swim. (I have to say on Fri morning there were no children in the pool until 9am and it was absolutely blissful - this is how it should have been the night before)

2 lights were not working by our bedside. This was annoying as it made it virtually impossible to read. I only noticed when I got into bed at 10.30pm and didn't feel like phoning reception at that time for someone to come up and fix the problem. More vigilance required by cleaning staff to ensure all lights are working. 

Breakfast wasn't quite up to the quality of the food the night before. This was disappointing as the food was so good the night before. A very dull fruit salad assortment - grapefruit, melon - I think that was it, as well as the usual items. I was expecting slightly more. 

No air con in room and it was a particularly hot night.

Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay. It was perfect for visiting the National Stud and Kildare Village.",4,2014,07,19
218,Lost & Found,"It wasn't long before I realized I would depart from this little slice of Paradise quite nonplussed.  It started really when I asked the porter if we could take an elevator to our room (normally I take the stairs but a recent accident has left my knees a little the worse for wear) and he replied, ""Eh, no, they haven't invented lifts that go sideways yet.""  It has a feel of Hogwarts about it, despite the lack of sideways elevators!  Bring breadcrumbs unless you have an excellent homing instinct.  I got lost, elevators may not have gone sideways but they seemed to go round corners.  Never mind that for now....This is a beautiful peaceful place to stay; the gardens are fabulous and there are loads of nooks and crannies where you can hide yourself away with a good book.  We had afternoon tea, ahem....it could do with a little refinement, unless of course you've just come in from ploughing a field.  For goodness sake, haven't they heard of finger sandwiches!  The food we ordered in the bar/restaurant was very enjoyable and staff plentiful and pleasant, At breakfast time I found myself staring at my plate in wonderment.  ""Eggs Benedict, hold the bacon"" turned out to be one lonely egg with an artful drizzle (I use the word advisedly) of hollandaise on half a toasted bap (!). Go figure.

Back to my elevator preoccupation:  the voice announcing floors was Irish and beautiful; not a bit plummy or hailing from foreign shores like most other elevators.

I think I had a great time......I'll have to go back to be certain.",4,2014,07,18
218,"Stunning location, great service","I attended a wedding at this hotel, they hosted the ceremony and the reception. The whole thing was fabulous. We arrived after a couple hours drive & were able to check in to our room early. Our room was quite far away from everything, nothing wrong with the room at all but I was with my mum who has difficulty walking. When we were walking to the service, a staff member saw my mum struggling & offered us assistance. Without us having to ask she offered to organise a closer room & within 10 minutes she told us we could move to a considerably closer room. After the wedding service I returned to our original room to pack our stuff then a porter came & transferred our bags. He was very helpful & pleasant. The customer service was fantastic. The food throughout was very nice, good selection at breakfast. The only thing was that the bar prices were a bit on the hefty side, not surprising in such a hotel. The old building and the grounds are stunning, I never got a chance to see the spa so can't comment on that. A good spot!",5,2014,07,13
218,"This hotel should be a 5 star rating, just a fab place to go","One word comes to mind when i think of this place CHARM CHARM CHARM. The staff were out on there own Louise, Patrica and a well built lad with dark hair was working in the restaurant on the 3th of july i think is name was shane or conor well he was just great and he looked after us so well we will be back again.. Thank you all for our lovely stay.",5,2014,07,09
218,Amazing spa day! ,"The hotel and it's staff are just delightful. The high tea is great value with it's tiers full of treats and freshly made sandwiches. The spa package deals are exceptionally good value. The spa is just superb, decorated to the highest order. If you are looking to treat yourself, this is definitely the place! ",5,2014,07,07
218,Lovely hotel with an old world feel,"Really lovely hotel, not shiny and new like most hotels these days, a little rough around the edges but I think this just adds to the hotel's charm. If you're looking for a flash modern hotel maybe Killashee is not for you but if you like character and comfort this is definitely the one. Our room was fantastic and the bed was super comfy. We had dinner in the hotel and the food was really good, not cheap but it was good quality so we didn't mind paying a bit extra. Breakfast was the best I've ever had in a hotel - yum! The leisure centre is across the car park which is not ideal but this is not a purpose built hotel so these things can't be helped. Both myself and my husband enjoyed our stay and we will definitely be returning.",4,2014,06,28
218,Beautiful Grounds & Friendly Staff,The Grounds are beautiful and we found the staff very friendly. The only problem we found wasn't the way the floors were ( I thought it gave it character) I thought the rooms could do with updating. They looked old and not 'character' old. In saying that we enjoyed our weekend stay and would recommend to friends.,4,2014,06,27
218,Stunning views,I stayed at this hotel for a wedding. It has the most beautiful grounds and rooms for wedding pictures. The staff were very friendly and the food was nice. I also used their gym and swimming pool which were great also.,5,2014,06,27
218,I love this place!,"Myself and girlfriend go here once a year! We both love a relaxing time and this place offers that. Jack's bar and Turners restaurant serve quality food. The rooms are huge and very comfortable. It is close to Kildare Village for a day of shopping and the spa is definitely worth a visit. This hotel may not suit many but for people, like ourselves, who enjoy a quiet break away to unwind, this is the place to go. See you soon Killashee House!",5,2014,06,24
218,Choose Killashee for your wedding!,"We had our Civil Partnership in Killashee House Hotel in May 2014 and the best decision we made while planning our wedding was to choose Killashee. From the very moment we stepped inside the door of the hotel we were treated with the utmost professionalism and warmth by every person we met from our first visit up to our check out after the wedding. 

The wedding team and especially Katie made our wedding planning absolutely stress-free by delivering on each and every thing they promised.  

Every member of staff from the weddings team, porters, waiters, bar staff, cleaners, managers etc who we dealt with were also a credit to themselves and the hotel. We were in the Killashee on numerous occasions before the wedding and each time our interactions with all staff were professional and welcoming. Its not often you go to a hotel of the size of Killashee and get a warm welcome but you truly do in Killashee. 

On the day of the wedding Max and Katie catered to our every question. I know a lot of people choose to get married at Killashee House Hotel but we did not feel like at any time like it was 'just another wedding', each staff member went out of their way to do whatever was asked. 

The hotel is beautiful with truly fantastic bedrooms function rooms and gardens. We had our ceremony in the Rathasker Suite and the hotel provided beautiful flowers throughout the hotel and on the tables. 

The wedding meal was absolutely delicious, we received so many compliments on how beautiful the food was and they are truly deserved. Our food was extremely tasty, hot and there was plenty of food for everyone. I know that people only hear good reviews of their wedding but I asked a few people who will always say what they truly feel and every single person loved the food and the service was super efficient but also very warm and welcoming. 

If you are trying to choose where to get married then trust me, picking Killashee will make your day stress free and amazing. I can not fault the hotel in any way and each of families and guests felt the same way.",5,2014,06,22
218,Great hotel great location especially for golfers and sports enthusiests and weddings .,Lovely Hotel in a beautifull setting with very friendly staff and great food . Service is very good and any small problems are quickly dealth with .this is a great place to be for top golf courses from the Ryder cup course at The K Club to other local courses at very reasonable prices.Top of this list is Craddockstown G.C. a real gem in Naas at very affordable prices starting at €15 per round . All told a lovely Hotel in a lovely area.,4,2014,06,19
218,It's an OK place to stay,"We come here almost every year as a group - part of an annual event. We get a family room plus a double. The rooms are quite spacious. However depending on where your room is located, you can have quite a journey to it from reception. The decor, carpet and furnishing can do with some refreshing. Some parts looked a bit tatty and worn. 
The shower is powerful but the shower glass is too small so all the water splashes out. 
The breakfast is buffet with choice if kitchen selection such as poached eggs, pancake or eggs Benedict. The kids loved its variety. 
The pool is not connected to the main building and can be quite crowded at times. 
The staff is very friendly and helpful. ",3,2014,06,18
218,Fab place,"This is a beautiful hotel quite old in parts but has a new part on it. 
We were at a family weddin here and the staff was so helpful and friendly. The food was lovely with a variety to choose from especially at breakfast time
The bedrooms are ackward to get to as u have to get a lift down then up to the bedrooms
This hotel is for a relaxing break and has got great scenery around the grounds",5,2014,06,18
218,Short visit,"Myself and my partner came here to look at this hotel for a possible wedding venue. Looking at the pictures online I was looking forward to visiting Killashee. Driving through the entrance it did not fail to impress. It was beautiful.
That day there was 2 weddings occurring at the hotel so they were quite busy. We were instructed to wait in the bar for the wedding coordinator as she was in a meeting and would we like a complimentary coffee while we wait. So far so good. The bar is lovely with high ceilings and enough natural light coming in through the right of the bar area. It would be perfect for a pre-wedding drink. 
We were waiting almost 15 minutes for 2 cups of coffee until one a member of staff came over to see if we were OK. We explained we were still waiting so he went to check on the coffee situation for us. Immediately the girl who took our order came out with the coffee.
We have heard of others with similar problems like this who also visited this hotel. On my wedding day this is not something I want to happen. I think that they are pushing themselves with 2 weddings on in one day. There is not enough staff or they have not been trained properly. Our meeting with the wedding coordinator was slightly rushed due to the fact she was managing both weddings. She showed us most of the hotel, although no bedrooms and the pub on site (which was closed on a Saturday, even though the only days it opened were on the weekend). 
At the bottom of the beautiful gardens at the back of the hotel you can see a building site with a broken train there also. Not the view I had expected. The spa is only accessible from a long walk over the other side of the hotel through the grounds, it is not attached to the hotel. 
If you are looking for that personal, good service and being the only bride on site then I would not recommend this hotel. 
They need to improve on the level of service, reduce to only 1 wedding a day and fix the building site at the back.",3,2014,06,16
218,Good - just needs that extra touch,"Stayed here with my wife and daughter for one night in the old part. The room is quaint, needs a new shower and new TV (old). Remote did not work and the furniture is poor. The bed was comfy and it was nice to have the sitting area (even though never used). The staff were friendly. Breakfast was ok. Asked three time for orange juice and gave up. The manger looked aggressive in the breakfast lounge and seemed to have an agenda. Would come back but the hotel need to have that extra touch.",4,2014,06,14
218,Birthday dinner with friends,"My friends surprised me for dinner at the Killashee Hotel, and I must say the service and food both were excellent. Defenetly 5* worth. I want to thank the lovely waitresses Adita and the good chef Antony for the best night ever. This was my first time; and there will definitely be more. Thank you to the Manager as well. And well done. ",5,2014,06,12
218,Wonderful!,"We stayed at the Killasheehouse Hotel as part of my birthday celebration and had a fabulous time! Staff were both professional and friendly and the service we received was second to none. Laura, the receptionist, was extremely pleasant and made a point of wishing me a very happy birthday. The staff went out of their way to make our stay absolutely wonderful. The hotel is lovely and our suite beautiful (loved the four poster bed). Breakfast in the Turner Restaurant offered a perfect start to the day, afternoon tea was delightful and dinner excellent. We highly recommend the Killasheehouse Hotel and will definitely return!",5,2014,06,10
218,Great staff,"I attended a large dinner last Friday, before a vintage car rally. There was a buffet for everyone, I am coeliac and having looked the menu discovered that there was nothing I could eat. I spoke to Liz, one of the waiting staff, who couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. She talked to the chef and arranged with him for a steak to be cooked. When it came to dessert, I did not even have to ask, a fruit salad was delivered to me, as they were serving everyone else desserts.  Many thanks to all the staff for being so understanding, in particular Liz.",5,2014,06,10
218,Disappointing,Left this hotel regretting my decision to have a nice Sunday Birthday dinner. While waiting on our order I noticed another table sending back their food because it was cold. Paying high prices and getting such low quality food was disappointing. Half of the chips we ordered were not cooked & the fish came to the table cold & the vegetables tasted like they were reheated and cooked days before. I would not recommend this hotel for its food and it is far from a fabulous fine dining experience.,1,2014,06,09
218,Disappointing considering the price,"We attended a family wedding here in May. The wedding dinner was delicious and the staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful. However, the bedroom was in the new part of the hotel, so this involved a bit of trekking - up in one lift, across a room and down a corridor, down in a second lift and then another stretch of corridors. The room itself was very spacious with 2 large, comfortable double beds. The ensuite was a disappointment as the shower was in the bath - I personally prefer a separate shower and despite a few free toiletries there was no face cloth, again something I like to use. The accommodation was expensive as were drinks so bring plenty of cash. Breakfast was very poor with a limited enough selection. The cooked breakfast wasn't even tepid when it arrived and the portion quite small.",3,2014,06,07
218,"Delicious food, wonderful service","I stayed here for the first time and will definitely be back.

The service at reception and in the bar was perfect, polite but friendly. I had the tasting plate in the bar which was absolutely delicious.

",4,2014,06,04
218,Sadly Disappointing ,"Stayed Saturday and Sunday night of the June bank holiday weekend. 
We were return customers for a second time and this time we were not happy. 
The first night we could not sleep as there was a wedding on in the hotel (which we were never told about) and our room window was situated about 20 yards from the dance hall and that kept us awake until after 2.30am. Had to keep the window closed to keep some of that noise out which made the room extremely hot and stuffy. Finally got to sleep about 3am  but to be awoken shortly after by the many loud and some intoxicated wedding party patrons, falling/walking back to their rooms. Our room was positioned right next to the elevator also which didn't help the situation. So much for the relaxing country retreat break!
Next day we went for drinks around 4pm in Jacks bar,lovely bar and set up there to be fair. Quite busy as there was a Strictly Come Dancing event and a post wedding party barbecue on which we found out about then. I was short changed at the bar and when I questioned it was met with a disbelieving response until 2 people near me at the bar questioned their change also. Not the first time this had happened with this particular employee according to customers.
Booked dinner in Jacks as part of the 2 b&b dinner package on that night for 7pm. We got talking to the restaurant manager and he said it would be extremely busy there at that time with all the goings on there, so we changed it to 7.45pm. Again we were not informed of this on initial booking. Meal was nice until the mains came out . Asked for well done steak and got rare,partner asked for medium and got well done. Sauces were wrong too. Couldn't get staffs attention so just stuck with it as we didn't have the patience to wait 20 min for replacements. 
Also inquired about bank holiday opening times for the Spa. Staff member wasn't sure and told us all info would be sent to room presumably via voicemail or written means but that never came. 
Second night also had very loud music blaring down on the reception area from the first level. Very hard to have a conversation with receptionist as a result,no point really as she could barley hear me. 
I didn't bring up these above points while checking out as I wasn't even asked how my stay went hence my critique via these means.
It's a nice hotel in a lovely area with lovely gardens but if your looking for a quiet country get away I'd personally stay clear.
",2,2014,06,03
218,Fantastic ,"Absolutely fantastic hotel,staff  couldn't be more helpful,nicola on reception was great.stayed in a junior suite so quiet and peaceful.bed was so comfortable and the late check out really made it all round a fantastic stay.looking forward to staying again only will stay longer next time.",5,2014,06,03
218,Beautiful Hotel - will go back,"I was at a wedding in January and couldn't find a fault with this hotel.

We received a free upgrade on arrival and the suite was very comfortable and we were very impressed.

The staff were excellent, very friendly and welcoming.  Also helpful as I left my earrings behind and when I called to check the housekeeping staff had found them and placed them in the safe until I could collect them.  

There was a good selection at breakfast although we did have to wait a while for service.  At the wedding dinner the night before the service and food was excellent.  I had specified my dietary requirements and when our table was served they knew exactly what I had ordered and brought it straight to me.

We also had lunch in the bar before heading home.  I would love to go back to try out the spa.

Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,30
218,A Hidden Gem,"My husband and I (Simon and Geraldine) arrived at the hotel around 5.30pm Friday 23rd May 2014. The driveway to the hotel and first view of the building are very impressive. Beautiful lobby, welcomed by an extremely friendly receptionist.  Delighted with our large room and even larger bed. Very acceptable ensuite bathroom.  Went to Jack's Bar for a meal.  Our waitress was GALA from Bulgaria. Food very tasty and well presented. Gala had a wonderful bubbly personality, was extremely attentive and really made our evening.  Breakfast next morning was served in the grand diningroom.  Wow what a selection and even better ""no hot buffet"".  The hot breakfast was served to us by friendly waitresses. 10 out of 10  That evening we ate again in Jack's Bar and our waitress was a beautiful Polish girl called EDYTA. She also couldn't do enough for us and we really enjoyed conversing with her.  We decided to eat at the hotel on our last night, Sunday, and GALA once again looked after us.  We also had the opportunity to meet the restaurant supervisor ANETA.  We had observed her over the past two evenings and commented on how well we felt she coped with a busy bar and restaurant.  What a darling she was.  We also met a young lad called ROB, a great character and a true asset to the team in Jack's Bar.  Oh yes I must mention ALI, a very efficient and fun barman. A big thankyou to you all for making our stay so wonderful, the craic was mighty. A mention must also go to the much forgotten housekeeping staff, you do a great job.  We are already making plans to return within the next few months.  To the Owners Mr Jack Tierney and Mr Denis McCoy, congratulations to you both for the wonderful hospitality particularly in these difficult times.  You are to be commended for upholding a 4 star establishment.  Best wishes and don't forget to appreciate your amazing staff.",5,2014,05,28
218,"Lovely place, crazy road!","Rural location, a few miles off the highway, but half the fun is getting there.  This is a complete hotel with everything you need without leaving the grounds.  Rooms are spotlessly clean, good-sized, with up-to-date furnishings.  The bathroom is large and modern.  WiFi was strong throughout the large building.  Breakfast is lovely with a large window view to a well-manicured garden.  Staff are very pleasant, helpful, and attentive.  There is a good-sized bar/lounge and the restaurant has excellent food.  However, it’s driving distance to anywhere along some narrow country roads.  It’s the perfect place to get off the highway and into rural Ireland!",5,2014,05,28
218,Afternoon tea at Killashee,"Treated to afternoon tea here by my daughter.  The overall experience was lovely and the food on the whole really good.  Plenty of tea/coffee and iced water - the waiting staff were very attentive and frequently appeared to make sure we had all we wanted.  Just a couple of niggles - we had no choice in the sandwiches (actually open sandwiches) and so the most luxurious one, the smoked salmon, was left as neither of us cares for it.  I would have been glad to have another egg one instead.  The scones were so bitter with soda that we could only eat half.  Plenty of butter & cream supplied.  On such a special occasion, jam would have been nicer servied in ramekins rather than the rather stiff confection in small screw top glass jars.  Now for the positive - the cakes & pastries were superb.  The panna cotta was so fresh and light to end with, and the little mousse in the glass was gorgeous - only thing was, the spoon was too big to get to the bottom, so we used the other end so as not to miss any!  Overall a really nice experience.",4,2014,05,25
218,Short and sweet,Stayed here last week for a friend's wedding. Beautiful garden in the rear of hotel and nice drive up to the main hotel. Lovely room with a big comfortable bed and delicious breakfast the next day.  Would recommend for a short break if you fancy something out of the way.,4,2014,05,20
218,Let down by poor after service,"This is the second time I've stayed at the hotel. I was very happy with the room and food at the hotel. The staff during my stay we're excellent and very helpful.

I did receive a wake up call at 4am on one morning and informed the staff at reception, agreeing that these things happen.

I did forget to pack two chargers and despite directing the reception staff to where they could be found, I  was told that they were not there. This was disappointing as I offered to pay the return postage and suspect somebody at the hotel of not telling the truth.",3,2014,05,18
218,A very nice stay,Was at the Leinster music awards in April again would love to say we had a great time we stayed for Two nights the Staff were very Helpful and could not do Enough for us  and again the room was spotless Clean well done to the cleaning Staff.   will be back for next year.     Thanks for making our stay so Enjoyable.,5,2014,05,14
218,Afternoon tea,"My friend and I had a most wonderful afternoon tea followed by champagne. Very good value, lovely surroundings and attentive staff. Just one small criticism - would have been nice to have had a china teapot instead of the stainless steel one. However, apart from that it was first class.",5,2014,05,13
218,SOOOOO Rude !!!!,"Sat 10th May  we went to Killashee hotel for lunch, on arrival we realised that there was alot of families celebrating 1st holy communion at the hotel. we went into the dining room & asked for a table for 4, as it wasn't booked the lovely waiter said he would have to check if anything was available as a lot of tables were reserved, he came back a few minutes later & went to talk to someone in higher authority, during this a lady dressed in a grey suit, so rudely ask if we were waiting on a table & told us that they were extremely busy & no table was available, we proceeded to tell her that a waiter was looking into it for us & she so rudely replied that she was the manager & she knew what she was talking about & that there was no table available.  such a rude personallity of a person i have never came across, if she is the manager of the hotel or dining room  she needs to go a personality crash course, her mannerism was something else,
 my daughter lives in newbridge & has been to this hotel on numerous occassions & has never came across this before, we were so disgusted with her attitude that we just walked out NEVER to return,",1,2014,05,12
218,Go to Jacks restaurant not Turners,"Hi we booked dinner for two in Turners Restaurant last Saturday night 3rd of May. We have  previously been to Turners and the food was beautiful sadly, not so on this occasion. We found the whole meal lacking in taste and presentation. I mentioned to our server that my starter did not taste remotely like goats cheese, he said he would mention it inside. We then got our main course, poorly presented and tasteless, on next to our baked Alaska ... Frozen solid inside. We did not complain to staff as they were very nice and attentive. In fact I was not going to mention it at all but for the fact we often visit Jacks restaurant and found the food in their much tastier. Maybe we were unlucky with the night maybe the chef was not on form??? They did take my starter off the total bill but even so we were looking forward to an evening of 'fine dining' and got anything but, I was disappointed that we did   not spend our money in 'jacks'  the Kilashee itself is beautiful and our experience won't keep us away, staff are excellent and friendly and attentive.     ",3,2014,05,08
218,Beautiful Escape,"Recently stayed here for 2 nites for a family wedding and absolutely loved it.  Our room was beautiful, it was in the old house which made it extra special, I did see rooms in the newer part and they were fabulous too.  Food all weekend was perfect both dinners and breakfasts.  Leisure facilities are top-notch as is the treatment you receive in the spa area.  I especially liked the bar in this hotel, really big and roomy but still extremely comfortable.  On the Saturday night there were 2 guys on in the bar, one playing guitar and the other keyboard and they were brilliant, really entertaining & friendly.  I did visit the snug type bar outside and it is fab, makes you think of what Ireland was like years and years ago, well worth a visit.  Overall enjoyed our stay here very much and it was made all the better by the friendly and helpful staff in the hotel.",5,2014,05,07
218,Perfect place to stay .....,"Brilliant. 3 nights stay whilst racing at Punchestown, great location, shuttle bus to race, large bedrooms, polite friendly staff good bar food .
Photos on website are as it in in real life which makes a change!",5,2014,05,06
218,Excellent Hotel,This hotel was a terrific find that we came across by chance on a hotel booking website. The room was very comfortable and spacious. The bar/bistro was superb. The breakfast room was very classy and the food fantastic. The only slight drawback was that the gym and leisure centre were open to the general public and can be busy and noisy. Little to fault with this hotel. Excellent staff.,5,2014,05,05
218,FULL of character,"Stayed here with the family for one night mid-week recently and we were very impressed.
A beautiful building with a great history. The facilities are excellent as are the staff. 
And best of all- WIFI that actually works in your room . I'm so sick of going to Irish hotels which advertise free WIFI only to find a pathetic dribble of data once you are more than 5 feet away from front desk.in killashee house I could stream Netflix from our room on the second floor NO PROBLEMO 😀

218,Dream Wedding (March 22nd 2014),"Epic wedding venue! 

We were married here in March 2014 and from start to finish the staff were amazing. They helped every step of the way. Katie was our wedding co-ordinator and left no stone unturned in the planning and organising of the day. Tim was the duty manager on the day and was brilliant - very professional and kept us at ease for the whole day - there's nothing he wouldnt do for us. Laura on reception was amazing - had some drama with flowers on the morning and she sorted this out - also many of our guests complimented her customer service skills. 

The venue itself was perfect! We didnt even notice that it was raining as we got loads of photos inside the hotel. The amount of praise and nice comments about the hotel, and staff, we got from our guests and families on the day (and afterwards) was excellent. Our guests still talk about how great the food and the service was during the meal - big shout-out to the chef and servers for that! 

From the first time we viewed the place, we knew this was the venue for us - but the experience itself, the general atmosphere and the praise and comments we've got since was completely above and beyond our expectations. My wife's cousin (from the UK) has actually booked her wedding here for next year - and she wasn't even at ours - she's booking it completely off the back of her parent's having such praise for the venue during our wedding. 

If you are thinking of a wedding venue, we cant recommend Killashee highly enough - here are some great points: 
The band can set up during your meal as the dancefloor is separate to the main dining area (but is still in the same room) - this means there's no big gap or lull between meal and first dance / band. the party keeps on rolling!
The bar at the dancefloor means that everyone stays together as a group and the dancefloor area is always buzzing and full of guests
The smoking area is a good bit away, and is nothing special, which means the smokers dont hang around out there all night
The drinks reception has a lovely comfy welcoming atmosphere - the big couches and armchairs make it very luxurious, and they were very generous with the free cocktail (on arrival)
The meal - 2nds was offered to everyone at the end of their main course and the wine was flowing (this was important to us, as we've been to plenty of weddings where they ""spare"" the wine!)
Any little touches or details you want to add in yourself (of which we did alot!) the staff will help you out in any way possible 
Hairdresser (Louise) on site - superb! Very convenient, and did SUCH an amazing job on the bride and bridesmaids - and very reasonably priced - would highly recommend her too! 

We couldn't have asked for a nicer venue - everything ran completely smoothly and really made our wedding extra special

Thanks so much again to every single member of staff at Killashee House Hotel - ye were amazing! Looking forward to coming back again for our wedding anniversary!",5,2014,05,05
218,Nice Break ,"Just back from a 2 night stay at Kilashee house hotel. Nice hotel,  excellent food,  with the exception of the 2 starters which we had at the formal dining restaurant which were disappointing. Luckily not a sign of things to come as the rest of the meal was nothing short of excellent including our next nights meal in Jacks bar. 
I was very disappointed in the reception staff at both check in and when I went to try to organise some other requirements. They were more interested in telling me what I couldnt do rather than listening to what I wanted to do. Even on check out, there was no customer service on offer. A little bit of personal service would go a long way. In fact both the leisure centre staff and the reception staff could learn a lot about customer service from the waiting staff who were excellent throughout. The leisure centre staff were not pleasant at all to deal with. 
The other thing that stood out in a disappointing way was the amount of signs and notices around the hotel saying what children are not allowed to do including a full page of rules in the restaurant menu pages. Luckily our 4 year old was well behaved! The whole thing comes across as a hotel that tolerates children rather than welcome them, which is odd because it had loads for children to do there.
Over all,  I really enjoyed the stay and definitely the food and will definitely return but I hope next time that I am treated as a guest rather than the reception staff treating me like a revenue source and the leisure centre staff treating me as an annoyance. ",3,2014,05,05
218,"Its a Winner, Training and Teamwork are evident!","Describe Killashee House Hotel in two words: Luxury and Bliss, topped with a professional team of energetic staff.
That’s the evidence I found on the occasion of my son’s wedding reception at this first class Hotel on May 1st. The service and courtesy provide to my family and guests was excellent. From the initial booking of the wedding to the final guest leaving the hotel on Friday morning was consistent and thorough, no stone was left unturned.
Located just a few mins drive from Naas town Co Kildare, and convenient to the Motorway. Killashee House Hotel is graced with a tree lined avenue, luscious mature gardens and ample parking in a wonderful setting for any occasions - especially weddings. The colourful gardens with attractive water feature accessories are any couple’s dream for wedding photography.
 The large reception area of the hotel is warm and welcoming. Seating areas provided for guests to meander around and sit at leisure is very accommodating. The décor is a nice mixture of a past ‘era’ and modern contemporary, luxurious and tranquil. The double stairwell is beautiful and makes a stunning focal point for any photographic subject.
Efficient and friendly Reception staff checked us in in a few moments and made everybody feel at ease. 
The function  room was beautifully adorned with atmospheric chandeliers.  Attractive floral displays and silver candelabras decked the crisp white linen table dressings.  A truly enchanting welcome for the bride and groom and their guest’s.  The wedding cake was proudly displayed on a side table yet protected from passers-by. The meal was served promptly with distinction, each course delicious and piping hot with extra helpings for anyone who desires more. The duty manager and his team were so professional and gave each guest personal attention in relation to each serving.
After the reception the tables were promptly cleared in preparation for the first dance and presentation of flowers etc., then the real celebrations began on the dance floor, lighting was perfect. The toilets were checked regularly and the public areas were kept spotless. Even though the whole hotel was buzzing with the racing patrons from the big racing event nearby at Punchestown racecourse.
The luxurious ‘Belling Suite’ was my haven of tranquillity for the night, Beautiful suite with large furniture and luxurious draped king sized bed & headboard with traditional ‘French themed’  pelmet,Fringed swags and tails adorned the window. (Possible a remansion  of the French nuns that once ran a girls boarding school there)
.WOW! A feeling of royalty is appreciated with the large marble bathroom with shower, large bathtub and double w.h.b’s, pure indulgence for the mother of the groom, mmmmm…. This suite is at the back of the hotel and one is assured of a peaceful night’s sleep.

Breakfast was served in the bright airy richly decorated dining room. Lovely fresh fruit, cereals and breads on the buffet with delicious dishes of scrambled egg/smoked salmon and the delightful ‘full Irish’ cooked to perfection, a great start to any morning.
I would recommend this hotel for any occasion, such as lunch, dinner, a weekend away but especially consider it for a wedding reception. 
I would also suggest to other hotel managers to visit this hotel and see hospitality four star services at its best (under pressure). 

 It is evident that Killashee House Hotel staff are  content at their work and have a genuine interest in their guests requirements at all times. Compliments to the management, receptionists, porters waiting staff, chefs and kitchen staff and last but not least the dedicated housekeeping staff. The gardener deserves a distinction award at some stage. Everybody is a well-trained team worker and consistent in caring for their departments. 10/10 for a most enjoyable Wedding Reception and I certainly will revisit in the near future.",5,2014,05,04
218,High Expectations!,"My partner and I book a 1 night bed and breakfast with evening meal as a treat.  I had well researched hotels in Naas and surrounding and Kilashee was top of my list.  The reviews and info on the hotel online was all very positive so we arrived expecting a lot.  I have to say we were not disappointed.  We arrived to the hotel quite early 11am and enquired about our room - it was ready for us!  We have a great room on the first floor with a view  of the garden.  Nicely decorated, very comfy and big bed.

The grounds very well maintained.  It is very quiet and relaxing.

Only disappointment was breakfast - food was only lukewarm.  I left most of my full irish on the plate.",5,2014,04,28
218,Fabulous time,From the time we walked in the door I was reminded of what good service is.  The staff were very friendly but professional.  The food was lovely for dinner in the luxurious turners restaurant.  The lunch menu was very nice and the wine nicely chilled.  The bar was hopping in the evening and there was lots of activity in the hotel with weddings and private functions but nobody clashed.  The room was very cosy and homely and the bathroom warm with lovely tiling and strong shower.  Breakfast sumptuous and the sun beating through the windows made a lovely start to our day.  Grounds lovely for a stroll and yes I would live to return.  Stayed there before in their bell tower suite (or whatever it was called) and so loved it then as well.,5,2014,04,27
218,Wonderful Wedding,I recently stayed for 2 night for a family wedding with my husband and two children. The staff were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  The Wedding Reception was very well organised and the day was thoroughly enjoyed by all. The Wedding Reception rooms looked stunning and the food was delicious! I can honestly say it is one of the best Weddings I have ever been to. Overall I would say this venue is extremely professional and the service we received was excellent.  I would highly recommend to anyone. Hopefully I will be retuning sometime in the future.,5,2014,04,27
218,Wedding Bliss,Recently stayed here for a wedding with my boyfriend. Food was fabulous as was the hospitality of the waiters and waitresses. Would highly recommend staying here whether it is a couple alone or as a family.,4,2014,04,25
218,Beautiful setting,"My husband and I decided to book a night away with our two young children over mid term break and we decided on Killashee house as not too far, first impressions were very good, the grounds are so beautiul, staff at reception were very friendly and our room was very nice, the hotel is very big and we needed two lifts to our room but this was not an issue for us as all quick enough, we then all had a swim but you do need to leave the hotel to cross to the leisure centre which i can imagine in bad weather might not be so good, we had dinner in jacks bistro which was lovely and staff were great with tge kids, breakfast was really good and then we had a lovely walk around the grounds and saw rabbits and squrrels which made the kids day, we will i sure be back for another stay in the near future.",5,2014,04,20
218,Elegant Hotel,"If you want an experience you will never forget then try a stay at The Killashee House hotel. The minute you drive up to the Hotel you get a feeling of elegance. It takes your breath away !!!

The reception staff are magnificent, so friendly, helpful and just downright nice. You feel like royalty from the moment you enter the hotel. 
The rooms are quaint but very comfortable and you are assured of a good nights sleep. The hotel has kept many original features which really enhances the whole place.
The gardens are so beautiful and well kept you cannot help but fall in love with them, the Butterfly garden is particularly lovely.
The food is excellant and the staff in Jacks restaurant are fantastic especially Robert, for a young lad he is very good at his job and is very pleasant and polite.
Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff here and I can only say t try it for yourself and find out for yourself, you will not be disappointed, I have been to many hotels in southern Ireland and I have to say this is one of the best. This hotel is one of the cleanest I have ever stayed in and would not hesitate to go back there.
Go on spoil yourself.",5,2014,04,16
218,Very nice hotel ,Was at a function in the hotel and stayed over. Service food and the room great. The bedroom was really quiet and the bathroom very good with lots of towels and shampoo  the meal in the dining room was excellent as well as the breakfast. I liked it ,4,2014,04,13
218,Pampering Sunday with Friends at Villa Spa,"Four friends enjoyed a offer in the Villa Spa of a spring rejuvenation which included four treatments for €99: a taster facial, an aromatherapy bath, back massage, head massage (while the face mask was doing its thing) and a dry flotation bed. Overall the package was reasonably priced and worth it considering that a standard facial of an hour is normally €60+ in a local salon, (though a therapist in this offer was only required for the facial and back massage.)
My therapist, Kelly, was very friendly and professional at her job and an advertisement for the products with her glowing appearance.
I thoroughly enjoyed the dry floatation experience, and loved the fact that there was a electric blanket on the bed during the facial.
The bath was good from a point of view of the varying jets, but I would question if it was a ""rose bath"" or indeed if any aromatherapy oil was added as there was no pleasant smell and I think it was just tap water, my personal preference would have been that the water was warmer.
In the relaxation room there was a welcome supply of tasty Iced Tea, Lemon Water and iced water which were replenished on request
I probably would not return outside of a very special offer as I felt the spa left itself down on a number of factors (a) on entering we were not given a tour of the spa or shown the facilities (if there are any a pool, sauna and whirl pool where advertised though I don't know if there are in the separate hotel building) (b) the changing room is aged and one of the two hair dryers wasn't working (ii) there was no hook outside the two showers to hang a towel or the issued robe (iii) the lighting over the mirrors was poor inefficient to allow clients sit and do their makeup (iv) I don't think they should bother with the fake flower petals around the treatment rooms which looked aged and shoddy either have the real thing or nothing (v) the flickering candle light was all from battery operated candles yes from a H&S point of view these are ideal but a few scented candles would add luxury and escapism 

A pleasant way to spend a Sunday with friends but I will be booking elsewhere on either packages or full indulgent treats before returning because of where this spa lets itself down (I-V above)",3,2014,04,13
218,Wonderful Memories,"We had our wedding here and stayed for the weekend after it. I can't complainant it enough. There was never a problem, the staff where all wonderful and the building is stunning. The room was huge and we checked some of our guests rooms that stayed the weekend also and they where similar. We had breakfast and dinner and the food was divine. I don't think it's possible to leave hungry. All in all a massive thumbs up and we can't wait to return for our anniversary!",5,2014,04,08
218,Afternoon of Fun,"Just returned from Afternoon tea at the Hotel with family and it is certainly a place we will be returning to.  Called this morning to confirm and spoke to Nigel (I think and if i'm wrong on the name I am sorry as he was very pleasant), I confirmed the amount of people and as it was a special occasion I wanted to ensure there was enough plates ordered, he said not to worry and he was right. I arrive and was greeted by the gent I spoke with earlier, table was ready and he remembered I said it was a birthday celebration and he would arrange a birthday plate for my mam.  We were brought to our table and told Hannah would look after us, when the rest of the party arrive our order for tea/coffee was taken.  There was a delay of about 25 minutes on getting the afternoon tea delivered but Hannah did come over twice to apologise and to say it would be with us shortly which we appreciated.  Nothing worse then not been told and trying to catch a staff member so well done.  Afternoon tea arrive, 1 one the afternoon stand and the other on just plates as they didn't have enough due to how busy it was (and it was busy)  It looked and tasted lovely, high complements on the relish on the Ham Sandwich, warm scones yum and gorgeous passion fruit cheesecake & mini pastries.  Due to numbers we ordered extra scones but aside from that there was plenty and Hannah offered to pack up the non eaten items for us to take home.  Hannah was attentive to our table, tea/coffee replenished (a number of times : ), time flew.  We left 3 hours later very happy and paid our bill with the same gent who showed us to our table.  If I did have a low point and to be it would be the room, it could do with being dressed better it does seem as if its a standby room not used only when very busy.  Aside from that it was my first visit but will not be my last and I would certainly recommend it to people.  Well done to the staff and thank you for making this family occasion a pleasant one",5,2014,04,05
218,We'll be back!!,"Had the pleasure of staying here with my extended family .to celebrate our mothers birthday recently and have to say that the staff were exceptional, they couldn't do enough for us. The hotel has a great atmosphere, the food and wine (limited selection) was lovely although a little pricey. We will definitely be back.",5,2014,04,05
218,Afternoon of disappointment !,"Booked afternoon tea as a Mothers day treat. The price seemed very reasonable.
On arriving to the hotel it looked really lovely. Lovely reception area & nice reception staff. When we were shown to the area where afternoon tea was served it was a side room off the bar. The room itself wasn't very cosy or welcoming.
When the afternoon tea come it looked tired form the get go !
The sandwiches were ok not exactly how they are described in the menu. The madeira cake had seen better days & the pastries were how I could only describe as terrible. The cheesecake looked as i it was still defrosting, the base was completely soggy.  The Macaroons were no way fresh I have tasted better macaroons from a supermarket. The glazed fruit tart consisted of a shop bought pastry case which soft, a blob of fresh cream half a strawberry & a raspberry, Im not sure where the glazed part was !
The lemon meringue was fine, apart from the soft pastry.
The only saving grace of the entire afternoon tea was the scones. They were fresh, still a little warm & tasted great. 
The waitering staff were pleasant but not very attentive. 
What should have been a lovely afternoon turned in to such a disappointment.",2,2014,03,30
218,I didn't want to come home - just fabulous!,"Myself & my fiance stayed here last weekend for my birthday after getting off to a bad start in a different hotel so we rang Kilashee House Hotel & thankfully it was available and they gave us a great deal also!

As soon as we drove up towards it I knew it was going to be fab, the interior, the stairs, the bar, the staff - everything about it oozes elegance!  The staff are so friendly and helpful, the place is spotless which must be difficult as the hotel is massive.

The room was immaculate with beautiful comfortable bedding.  The hotel bar had music both nights which was great as we stayed there both nights and enjoyed the excellent food, drink and music! The Snug Bar just around the corner of the hotel is so cute and has a real Irish feel about it, I felt like a tourist sitting by the fire reading the history that was all over the walls - I didn't want to leave!

Kilashee House Hotel is the type of hotel that you could stay there all weekend, enjoy the buzz around the place and sit and watch people and the world go by.  It has beautiful grounds with a beautiful garden which is has a fountain where it asks you to forget your worries and enjoy the peace around you - it really is a beautiful place!

Unfortunately, I won't be able to get back to Kilashee until the new year and I am already looking forward to it more so than my honeymoon in America at the end of the year!!

It is a place that I honestly cannot fault, a place that makes you feel like you are away from all the daily stresses of life and definitely a place that stole my heart - I can't wait to go back! Thank you Kilashee House Hotel x",5,2014,03,27
218,Where the good fairies hang out!,"My sister and I had an overnight stay at this hotel last week.  The weather was poor - wet and windy - but the hotel more than made up for that nuisance.  Laura, a happy, friendly girl, checked us in at Reception. We were in Room 316 which had two huge and very comfortable beds (we loved the white linen bedclothes) with an abundance of pillows.  316 overlooks the garden where the daffodils and narcissi brightened the whole aspect, not alone for us but for the two bunny rabbits which kept bobbing in and out.of the woodland area. Peace and tranquillity reigned.  The room was warm, clean and inviting and the en suite was similar.  Two fluffy bathrobes were there for us and plenty of soft white towels.  

We had a snack in Jack's Bar & Bistro...really good mushroom soup and a very well-filled Ciabatta ""sandwich"".   We had booked Dinner for 7.30 and this also was delicious, all four courses, presentation was good and the service was brisk and efficient.  In fact the staff went out of their way to make sure that we had all condiments, sauces etc.and that the food was to our liking.  Thank you girls for your unobtrusive care and attention.  There was a huge fire burning in Jack's and plenty of seating nearby where one could relax before or after their meal.

Following a good night's peaceful sleep we had breakfast in the Main Diningroom - Turner's.  There was food available in plentiful supply and to suit all tastes....juices, fruits, cereals, breads, cakes etc. (but ah, they had run out of grapefruit sections... caught napping in the midst of all the various options!!)  We both had a delicious cooked breakfast - almost anything we wished to have, nothing was any trouble and served with a smile and a cheery word to enjoy.  

Obviously a popular hotel with Corporate clients also, as each day there were Company 
Conferences going on in the different Suites and many people staying over too, as there was more of a rush on the complementary 'Irish Times' at breakfast time.

It must cost a fortune to keep this place in pristine condition and the owners are doing a very good job.  I did see a rip in the carpet on one of the corridors, perhaps at a joining, but I wholeheartedly forgive them for that.  My sister thinks that some good fairies must still live in Killashee and we'd love to come back when the weather improves to check that out, together with the beautiful grounds, the fountains and the walks in the gardens.  

Laura at Reception gave us directions to take us straight to the N7, thus avoiding going through Naas town as we were not planning any shopping in the heavy rain.",5,2014,03,23
218,Full of character and delicious food,"The hotel had full of character from the outside to the inside. I usually prefer a modern style hotel, but I must say that even though it was nowhere near modern, this hotel was surprisingly good in its own way.  The Turner's restaurant offered the best food in town. Boyfriend can't stop talking about it for weeks after we had dinner there. Although the room only had the basic amenities e.g. towels, toiletries, etc. it was huge, cozy, and clean. Bed was comfortable. We asked for some shaving and oral hygiene kit and they were given to us free of charge. Free wifi connection. The only cons I could think of during our stay was that our room was not well lighted. It could be just an add-on to the feel but I think it would best to have options to make the room brighter. Also, the elevator needs upgrading.

Overall experience was great and I would definitely recommend spending a night there with a lovely dinner plus a bottle of wine.",4,2014,03,20
218,Relaxing short break near Dublin,"Stayed over St. Patrick's Day weekend on a 2 night B&B package. A very pleasant stay overall to recharge the batteries and escape the madness of the capital!

I requested a bright, sunny room at booking and the room we were given was just that overlooking the beautiful butterfly garden. The room was quite clean and comfortable if a little tired in areas such as stained edges on curtains and the cushion of one of the upholstered chairs. 

Our spa visit for a package of treatments was great. Found it a little unusual that the pools, sauna and steam room are not directly accessible through the spa changing rooms and are instead connected to the gym changing rooms. The facilities here were again a little tired with some cracks in at least one of the plastic steam room seats which could be a nasty surprise if you didn't spot it. 

One of my favourite aspects of the hotel is the variety of different spaces available to guests to relax in outside of the main hotel bar. Missed out on a visit to The Snug Bar mixing up the days it was open but would love to check it out in a future visit as it looks very snug indeed.

Breakfast was good with a standard cold buffet and á la carte menu of hot dishes made to order. Dinner in Jack's Bar on both nights was very good, steaks a particular highlight. Staff were very pleasant and helpful throughout the stay, wifi was solid and atmosphere very relaxing. 

Overall a great weekend only 45mins from Dublin, hope the place gets the little bit of TLC it deserves soon.",4,2014,03,18
218,Excellent and Friendly,"Had a lovely two night stay here. Room very comfortable and quiet, food excellent and helpfulness of staff much appreciated. A hotel for all travellers and so easy to get to from Dublin. Loved the Butterfly Garden in aid of DEBRA Ireland. A great relaxing break.   ",4,2014,03,18
218,A lovely hotel,"I was a guest at a wedding a few days ago. I attended with a friend and we booked single accommodation as soon as we got the invitation. We decided to travel the day before and what a good decision that was as we had such a lovely time. We arrived early afternoon to this very elegant hotel. The entrance hall is very impressive with beautiful furnishings and gorgeous chandeliers. The staff were welcoming and helpful and we were shown to very spacious tastefully furnished bedrooms with lovely bathrooms.
After a delicious cup of tea in our rooms we visited the spa in the grounds of the hotel. My friend had booked a massage treatment on arrival and I went for a swim, steam and sauna.The gym and pool areas are well equipped and staffed. Swimming lessons were on but the pool is spacious and there was plenty of room for  each swimmer.
I was so impressed with how my friend enjoyed her massage that I booked for the next morning. The spa is so elegant, spacious, beautifully equipped and well staffed. I was looked after by Lorna who is a very experienced competent beautician and following a very beneficial massage I was shown to a lovely cosy relaxing room to relax. I had to steal myself away that morning as the wedding time was approaching.i will allow plenty of time  when I next visit.
We had decided to have a dinner package at the hotel on the first evening and we booked for Jacks Bar. This area is spacious and comfortable with a very large fireplace and many  sofas and chairs to sit and enjoy a pre dinner drink and peruse the menu.
The choice of food was amazing, to suit all tastes and appetites. We had a delicious dinner with all  three courses. The staff were so helpful and discrete throughout our evening. We had a very helpful young lady called Ella  who looked after all our needs. Another young lady who assisted was Gala.  It was just lovely to be looked after by helpful pleasant staff.
Breakfast was a wonderful experience, with continental choices, and numerous cereals, fresh fruit yoghurt, juices. A varied choice of cooked meals was available  from full Irish to pancakes with maple syrup. Several difficult decisions had to be made.
The wedding celebrations commenced with a very welcome reception of sandwiches, scones biscuits, tea coffee and cocktail drink all served in a very beautiful balcony area.
We  enjoyed a delicious wedding dinner, carefully chosen to suit each guest and every course was beautifully presented and tasted superb. Everyone I spoke with said the same, just a really delicious meal. The staff were helpful and quietly efficient and made the wedding a very memorable day for everyone.
I would recommend this hotel for a special occasion , but I have been telling friends since returning home that I am looking forward to a return visit as a special treat. It is just a lovely place to stay, dine and enjoy the elegant spa facilities.
Well done to everyone at Killashee House Hotel for making our visit really special.",5,2014,03,17
218,Excellent in everyway,"This place ranks with some of the top hotels I have stayed in, it's an old school, it's a bit of a maze finding your way to the rooms, with you going down when you think you have gone up, fabulous setting, amazing reception and bar area, amazing full Irish breakfast, as mentioned one of the best ever for me.",5,2014,03,15
218,Fab food and amazing bed,We stayed with a group of friends in March and had a great time.  The food in both Jacks Bar and the restaurant was fantastic.  Although the rooms could do with a little TLC the beds were the most comfortable we have ever encountered - truly out of this world. Although it is a bid hotel with lots of weddings / functions the rooms are quiet.  Breakfast is superb and the staff very friendly.  The use of a great gym and pool make it a perfect retreat.,5,2014,03,14
218,Fantastic Service,"The Hotel is more of a resort. It has all the facilities you could wish for and great for a weekend break. Staff are so friendly and efficient. Laura on reception was so helpful. Dinner in Jacks Bar & Bistro was of a higher standard than I anticipated as it is the less formal of the two restaurants on offer, The chowder and Duck were delicious. My wife had the Hake which was the best fish dish she has had in ages. The service was so efficient from Edyta and Ellen who managed to upsell desserts which were yummy. Great pool and breakfast was a great send off. See you again soon Killashee.",5,2014,03,13
218,Wonderful Ambience! ,"A true gem. Beautiful grounds and marvellous interior. A true Lady among Irish hotels. Food is superb as is the comfort of the bed - so important,  don't you think? The rooms,  while very comfortable and spacious are also very graceful.  
The only minor criticism,  is that the rooms could be warmer, but then I'm a female! ",5,2014,03,11
218,nice,"Went to stay at Killashee House hotel as a surprise gift.  

While the hotel was quite busy, it didn't feel packed.  Went for dinner in Jack's bar the first night, and we ordered fillet steak.  Having waited a good half hour we were presented with a dry, burned offering, which we immediately sent back.  I was surprised, as Killashee house hotel is renowned for its good food.

The hotel manager came over to us to find out exactly what the problem was with the steaks.  there was no issue in taking them back, and we even got a tasting plate to stem the hunger while we were waiting for fresh steaks.

Breakfast was very good, and dinner the following evening was very nice.

all in all it was a nice trip away.  the room was fine, and the food was very nice.",4,2014,03,11
218,Valentines Romance,"Lovely hotel for romance. We stayed in the Bell Tower room, a beautiful room in the original part of the house. This was an upgrade on the executive suite we originally booked. We were delighted! There are two great bars, that are distinctly different. We had a really nice time in both. The main bar has a great atmosphere and lovely food. We had a really nice weekend and will definitely be back.",5,2014,03,10
218,Little bit of heaven,"Arrived at Killashee house on a saturday for an overnight spa break.....Had afternoon tea in Jacks Bar,which was absolutely gorgeous.4 layers of sambos cakes,scones bread and glasses of champagne,tea coffee...Didnt eat from the bar menu but food looked fab and kitchen was very busy! Dinner in Turners,4 course..cannot say enough how enjoyable this meal was ,menu has something for everyone and the surroundings are also really nice.Breakfast in Turners the following morning-lovely full irish breakfast-also continental buffet if required.We had our treatments in the villa spa on sunday morning-after a slight mix up when the girl couldnt find our booking,she quickly fit us in and all ran smoothly.Dry floataion facial and massage,all amazing and the spa is beautiful and very relaxing.THe most important thing to mention about this hotel is the staff,every staff member we met were polite and helpful but mainly Emma in Jacks Bar & Alison in turners restaurant,both ladies made us feel very special and really stood out for us. Definetly will be back.",5,2014,03,10
218,Wedding Heaven!,"In February of this year myself and my husband held our wedding celebrations in Killashee. In summary I highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about having any sort of event here or even just a few nights break.

We decided to have our wedding celebrations in Killashee House as it had the perfect combination of amenities we wanted - a stunning room for our Humanist Ceremony, a beautiful old house with 2 reception rooms and an intimate dining hall for under 100 guests, unique accommodation for the bridal party and close family, the cutest bar I have ever come across in a hotel - ""The Snug Pub"", Spa, Hairdressers and enough accommodation for all our guests. From our first visit to Killashee we felt at home and we knew from meeting the staff that they would take care of us.

Their wedding co-ordinators, Katie and Lisa, are exceptional and were extremely efficient and accommodating from the first day we met right up to the day before the wedding. The night before the wedding we organised a dinner in a private dining room for about 30 guests and the room was set up to the same std as our room on our wedding day - candles lighting, beautiful laid out tables, personalised menus. It was a really lovely night and the food was amazing! At this stage I was wondering how the next day was going to top it. The restaurant manager Nigel was really friendly and accommodating and he looked after our group for the night. 
On the day of the wedding Max the Duty Manager took over and he was fantastic. Throughout the day every single request was looked after and he ensured that the ceremony and reception ran without any issues. He was always there in the background as a support to us which is invaluable on the day. We had a Humanist ceremony in the Belling Suite which is one of the most beautiful ceremony rooms I came across on my search for a hotel ceremony. The original house was decorated beautifully with candles, petals and flowers and the fires were lighting. I believe the pre-reception drinks were well received (we missed it all because of our pictures!) and then it was time for dinner! The only criticism of the whole weekend that I had was that one of our main courses, the monkfish, was slightly overdone but it probably didnt help that our speeches ran over a bit. The rest of the food was divine and our guests thoroughly enjoyed our bacon butties that we organised for later that night. The day and night flew by and the staff took such good care of us all.

The day after the wedding  Katie our wedding co-ordinator organised for a bus to take a group of my guests to the Kildare Outlets where they recovered from their hangovers with a bit of retail therapy! After the shopping finished we settled into Jacks Bar and watched a rugby match and there was a fantastic atmosphere in the hotel as there 2 weddings on that day aswell. That afternoon we put in a very late request to Nigel (Restaurant mgr) for a section big enough for 30 people and despite the fact they were fully booked for dinner (and they were catering for 2 weddings!) he set up the private dining room for us without any hassle and he even printed out some personalised menus for us! (all the little touches count) After dinner we retired to the “Snug” pub where the poor bar staff had to put up us having a sing-song for hours followed by a trip to the residents bar. 

Overall we had a fantastic experience with Killashee and there is nothing the staff wouldn’t do for you! From the porters to the waiting/bar staff to the receptionists to the management team, every single person made us feel welcome and looked after our every need. All of our guests commented on the hotel and they made sure they were looked after in terms of early check-in, general queries, help with luggage etc. Killashee really felt like home away from home and whilst it may not have the most polished décor and a slightly confusing layout, for me this actually added to the charm of the hotel.",5,2014,03,06
218,Tired and ageing,"We booked in for two nights with our one year old son. In its hay day this was probably an amazing hotel but the recession has obviously hit hard. Decor is tired, carpets worn and rooms need an update. Not particularly good value at the room rate. It's OK but that's it! Not sure we would either recommend or come again.",3,2014,03,05
218,Wet bed!!!!,"I was here at a wedding. It was a while back but I didn't want to comment before so as to upset the bride. When we arrive the staff were very helpful. However, this didn't continue. When we went to bed at approx 3am the bed was wet. I had to call down for the rooms to be changed. I didn't mind this so much, except there was never an apology for this. I actually had to mention this to the staff and didn't receive even a mumble of response at the time. This negated all of the service the day before. It was as if we were no longer the wedding party, therefore it wasn't necessary to please us! When I got home from the venue I was incredibly ill. Not sure if it was down to the food but it was the end of a very disappointing weekend.",2,2014,02,25
218,Wonderful weekend ....,"As a guest at a family wedding this weekend at Killashee House Hotel it was a wonderful experience  in every way, From the massage/hair and Spa facilities to the rooms, food, bar and not forgetting the 'Snug' we all had a great weekend and I cannot praise the hotel and its staff highly enough.",5,2014,02,24
218,A real getaway,"Fabulous 1 x night stay with family @ Kilashee House Hotel.What a place, 3 weddings on over the weekend. We were having a simple family gathering. The hotel itself was so busy. It has to said that even though it was incredibly busy, the staff were amazing. They had to work hard yet you never felt that your request went unheard. Marie served us in Turners restaurant on the 2nd half of her split shift from Saturday. She was still able to smile & be absolutely courteous. The staff at reception were exceptionally professional. Just wanted to commend the management for the incredible job that they do. We had such a fantastic stay which was just overnight. The building itself & its history give it such a sense of grandeur yet simplicity & spaciousness combined. As for the leisure centre I was in my element. Thank you. Certainly hope to visit again.",5,2014,02,23
218,Dinner in the bar,"Beautiful venue, but this had to be the worst meal ever in a country that offers excellent food.
The lamb rump was as tough as old boots and the vegetables - the few they served - soggy and cold.
We sat for one hour before our main course (the first course we ordered) came.  We ordered chocolate moose for desert and this came in the form of a dense mud cake.....

Really poor.",1,2014,02,22
218,"Mixed Review, Nice but room for improvement","Myself and my partner stayed here for a valentines getaway. 

Hotel is very peaceful and quite. With an old(er) feel to the building. We would normally go for a more ""modern"" hotel. However we were pleasantly surprised. Stairs in the main reception is impressive and sets the mood from there.

We stayed in the Junior Suit which was nice and big, nicely decorated in an ""old School"" kind of way. A very comfortable large bed and the pillows were just right.
 
Wall paper did show signs of its age with several marks near radiator and in the bathroom. 

Not that we used it, but the telly in the room was an old ""box"" type so leave your HDMI cable at home if you did want to connect your laptop to it.

Jacuzzi bath is very small, with just enough room for one. 

Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful at all times.

We arrived to the restaurant which was not full by any means. Our table for dinner was booked for 7pm and arrived on time to be asked to wait for the table to be cleaned. After waiting at the bar for 15-20 mins, I had to remind them who I was (not a big deal but didn't feel like a 4 star treatment)

Food in the restaurant was lovely, perfectly cooked and presented very well. Our waitress was lovely and took her time and explained the dishes quite well.

We got breakfast in bed service, which was nice but did feel a bit small.

Overall I would recommend this to a couple or someone looking for a relaxed getaway.",5,2014,02,20
218,More suited to older and mature clients,"Stayed here for a weekend with family during Chinese New Year celebrations. Outside looks lovely considering it's a very old building, inside is a bit dated except the bar which had a lovely atmosphere. The layout of the place is very confusing , at one stage I found 2 children lost and upset so I had to guide them back to their room. The rooms themselves are quite big but the decor is more suited to older people. The beds are very comfortable. The breakfast in the morning is fine and freshly cooked. If I was of retirement age I'd probably love it.",3,2014,02,17
218,Great Experience in Co Kildare,"Great overnight stay in Killashee House, old world hotel with a modern touch. Excellent evening meal which was part of a package that we hadn't pre booked but offered on check-in, nice touch by a very friendly professional Receptionist. 
The hotel was very busy lots of activity going on  in different sections of the hotel, wedding, private dinner parties etc. The bar was fabulous, great ambiance with a nice food menu, the bar also operates as  a second restaurant but discretely so.
Bedroom was excellent, comfortable and spacious, only minor complaint  was  breakfast, tea was stewed, egg served hard despite request for soft, to be fair it was exceptionally busy however staff remained courteous and helpful at all times.
Overall a very good experience would have no hesitation in recommending Killashee House",4,2014,02,17
218,Valentine's Weekend Break,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at Killashee House Hotel. We were very impressed with this hotel from the moment we arrived. Reception staff were friendly and efficient. There was a wedding taking place and the piano playing added to the romantic atmosphere of the weekend. The room met our expectations and the bed was so comfortable. Dinner in Turner's restaurant was included in the package and did not disappoint. Waiting staff were so attentive and each course was beautiful. If you are visiting at the weekend you must go to ""the snug pub"" which added a little bit of romantic charm to our visit. We can not wait to return.",5,2014,02,16
218,Very good and convenient,"If you are in the area, there is not much choice but Killashee House is good, close to everything, and has a good price offer. 
Pool and gym are free and from 6-30 and under gym I mean GYM! You have everything!
Not much choices in terms of food, only Jack,s bar was open on Sunday and Monday, but steaks were perfect and Guinness was cold.",4,2014,02,10
218,Very happy with our girls break,"We stayed on a girls weekend package with spa and dinner, by emailing the hotel directly we got a great deal and they were very flexible about the spa treatment choices.
Our Room was in the old part of the house a generous triple room with two doubles and a single, old world charm and decor. 
We ate decent bar food on the first night  plus a nice cheese board and  a few drinks followed by an amazing nights sleep, the beds were so comfy! 
Breakfast in Turners restaurant set us up for the day, full Irish, freshly squeezed orange juice which was impressive. (A pet hate of mine when hotels provide the juice from cartons)
We had two spa treatments, I was very impressed with Sharon she gave me a fab mini facial and back massage, she was very helpful and friendly.  The spa is outside but once you are in the spa it is relaxing and we all fell asleep in the relaxation room.

Dinner in Turners was delicious, I had seabass and the cheeseboard for desert. 

All the staff we dealt with were very friendly and I would love to go back",5,2014,02,07
218,A little taste of Heaven!,"Just had a fabulous return stay at Killashee House at the weekend.  I honestly believe that that place is like a fine wine, getting better with age.  I’ve always had a soft spot for this hotel so have come to expect the best from it and they never let me down.  My Partner best described it at the weekend, “what makes an excellent hotel even better are the staff that they have” and Killashee House have an abundance of those excellent people.

The room we had was amazing, we’d been given one of the beautiful suites, it was just a pity it was only a one night stay.  The bed was exquisite and I’d have slept there for a week if I could.  We’d booked dinner in Turners restaurant and as always the food was delicious and the overall experience was welcoming, warm and relaxing and that was down to the lovely staff working very hard there.  We spent the following few hours in the bar and again the guys in there were out on their own.  Normally I’d have one or two drinks and retire for the night but because of the banter and atmosphere, we stayed on until much later.

Next visit I’ll have to arrive earlier and make the most of the hotel surroundings but I’ll definitely be back.  

I think on this visit what really stuck out for us were the staff, from the girls on reception, to the guys in the bar and all the waiting staff, they do an exceptional job and Killashee House should be proud of all of them.",5,2014,02,03
218,New Year's Day Wedding,"We had our wedding here on New Year's Day 2014 and I cannot praise this hotel enough. I found Lisa & Katie lovely to deal with and always replied to my emails and phone calls promptly and no request was too much hassle. On the day, Simon and Brian were fantastic, everything was perfect. My guests are still talking about the fabulous food and also the breakfast the next morning. The rooms were spacious, clean and very luxurious. The staff on the day were helpful and professional. The Thompson Suite looked beautiful and the lights adorning the driveway and throughout the hotel were magical! Killashee is a superb wedding venue, we had 200 very happy guests and a day we'll never forget. ",5,2014,02,01
218,Wedding December 2013,"We had our wedding reception in Killashee House in December 2013. They took amazing care of us every step of the way - from making the original booking in January to answering any and every question in the build up to the wedding to the level of service provided on the day before, day of and day after the wedding. Every request was met and the staff were all so friendly and helpful. I can't recommend Killashee highly enough as a wedding venue.",5,2014,01,31
218,"Like good wine, this place has improved with age!","We travelled home from Australia to have our wedding in Killashee House Hotel at the beginning of January. This place could hold its own with any 5 star wedding venue. From dealing with the wonderful staff via email and phone for the most part of the planning, they were excellent throughout. The day was magical and nothing was too much for them. From the managers, receptionists, wedding coordinators, and wait staff to the finer details and food/drink, I cannot recommend Killashee highly enough. Top marks. I frequented this hotel on several occassions in the mid 2000's. It was good then but like good wine, it has improved with age. Thanks Killashee for a magical day and such beautiful memories. Gemma & Alan",5,2014,01,31
218,"Great value, great service","I stayed here just for one night for a treat for our wedding anniversary. It was a lovely stay. At check in we were told we were upgraded to a suite, which I think is the biggest room we have ever stayed in. We had dinner in Turners restaurant which was of excellent standard. The bed was huge & comfortable. I'd recommend it to anyone.",5,2014,01,22
218,Smelly Bedroom,"Had a recent stay at Killashee House. The Reception staff were lovely and very helpful and super friendly. We got to our room and on the way to the room it smelled musty from perhaps some dampness, then we got to our room which was a family room, we entered and it was stinking of cigarette smoke, not just a mild smell a extremely bad smell for a non-smoking room. The cleaning staff should of alterted their department manager to warn not to put guests in to this room until it was fully ventilated. It was late enough when we got to the Hotel so we opened all the windows and wanted to get some dinner before the restaurant closed, we got dinner and it was lovely, really nice menu and the food was really good. The restaurant Jacks was very quiet and a lot of staff around but they were slow to come over to us to offer service so we had to get their attention for drinks and the bill which was a long time coming. But they were friendly but could of been more attentive seeing they were not at all busy. We returned to our room after diner closed the windows and though we had gotten rid of most of the smokey smell but it was still there and was vile. I kept waking up during the night smelling it even though we slept with a window open. The bedrooms in this hotel are a little outdated, the shower was a little bit old fashioned... the room itself basic enough. We decided to watch a DVD in the room and we called down to reception and they had a porter bring up the DVD, they were just so lovely and helpful. Had we of asked on arrival to be moved to another room I am sure they would of accommodated us with no problem at all but I do think the manager over cleaning should of picked up on this issue with the smell. When I checked out the following morning I informed the reception of the smell and she did say you should of told us and we would of moved you but we did think that it might go away with opening the windows and it was getting late. Breakfast the next morning was absolutely lovely, such a lovely selection of fresh fruit and the hot food was as it should be hot and fresh. Really nice. Overall we had a nice stay.. food good, staff lovely.",3,2014,01,22
218,Excellent Hotel,"Had heard several good reports on the Killashee, so decided to stay here for a weekend getaway. We came here to relax and in truth this was achieved so i guess all in all mission was accomplished. The rooms were nice and cosy, the spa and leisure facilities were excellent and the food was pretty good. We ate in the restaurant the 1st night and been honest although the food was good, the room really lacked any kind of real dining experience and with it been the breakfast room one automatically got the feeling they'd appreciate you moving on. This was confirmed when we got our check without request. The second evening we chose to eat in the bar and again i couldnt complain about the food as it was nice. For me, what makes any business is their staff and in this hotel i would say their Front Desk and Kitchen is strong but over the course of the weekend i found the rest really needing a little more training and supervision. What i will say is that they are all very polite and with proper direction can become assets to a hotel with alot of potential. Best of luck with that.",4,2014,01,19
218,great staff,"stayed here last night, 18th jan, welcoming staff , rooms a bit dated but clean, had a meal in restaurant, staff so helpful , especially alison, and the female hostess, fillet steak to die for, used the spa, staff and facilities very good too, just didn't like the fact the spa is separate from the hotel and had to walk across in the dark. needed a hair brush, forgot mine and house keeping staff very helpful, overall plenty of friendly , helpful and knowledgeable staff make the place well worth a visit!",4,2014,01,19
218,OVERNIGHT STAY AT KILLASHEE,"I stayed with my mum and sister last Saturday night at Killashee.  I had heard great reports and had high expectations.  The hotel is excellent.  We had very large adjoining rooms overlooking beautiful gardens.  We had shopped nearby in Kildare village and unfortunately didn't have time to try the Spa.  We had drinks in Jack's bar before having a superb meal in Turner's restaurant. Only pay the 5 Euro supplement for the fillet steak if you are starving. It was huge! but delicious.  Our beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very quiet even though there was a wedding on.  We had a lovely breakfast served to us the next morning.  What I want to mention most was that I have stayed in many hotels and never encountered better, more efficient, friendlier staff ever. From the moment we arrived to our departure.  It is worth a mention because it was exceptional.  We had a wonderful night and wish we had been staying longer.  I look forward to returning.",5,2014,01,17
218,Great experience,"A one night get away was made all the more memorable and pleasurable by the fantastic staff at Killashee. We stayed for one night but made use of all the facilities, including drinks in Jack's Bar (great cocktails), amazing, delicious and visually appealing food in the restaurant and a night cap (or two) in the snug. The room itself was amazing and the experience was topped off by a hearty full Irish the following morning.",5,2014,01,15
218,Afternoon Tea,"Went for afternoon tea, I had been a few years ago and really enjoyed the experience, especially the atmosphere. This time we weren't seated upstairs, on the lovely comfortable sofas, we were in the bar. They did put a lovely white tablecloth on the table but it just wasn't the right setting for such an afternoon treat.
The food was lovely and the service was good.
The price has been increased by €5, even though I didn't notice an increase in the amount of food.
We enjoyed it but was disappointed at seating location and the increase in price.",3,2014,01,14
218,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel while attending a work conference for 1night and was quite satisfied. Check-in and check-out was very quick and smooth with very friendly staff. It’s a beautiful Victorian Manor House with beautiful landscaped gardens. Everything about our stay was first class. The room was very clean, very comfortable, a good sized room and bathroom, had all the usual tea/coffee facilities and toiletries. Two downfalls of the hotel is having to go up and down lifts to get to the rooms and the lift doors kept closing very quick which was quite dangerous.

As we were here for a conference we had lunch, dinner & breakfast in the hotel, the food was excellent, beautifully presented and the staff were lovely. Breakfast was fantastic with a great selection of cereals, fruits etc. and various cooked options. The morning and afternoon tea/ coffee and the pre dinner drinks reception were presented great as well.

We never got to use the leisure centre but we did use the hairdressers which was quite expensive but then it’s a 4* hotel.

Overall, this is a very good hotel and I would definitely stay here again!!",5,2014,01,12
218,Shopping trip,"Great hotel, lovely friendly staff. Bar food excellent and staff very helpful. Great location for Kildare village shopping.
Breakfast excellent, it's good getting breakfast cooked and served to you.
Highly recommended",4,2014,01,08
218,Superb as always,Stayed here a few years ago and had to come back for relaxing leisure break. Staff still the best of any Hotel i have visited. Lovely room with plenty of space. Food in Jacks was great and Staff so friendly. A la Carte brekkie is still a winner and i recommend the eggs benedict! Thank you again to Laura on reception for all your help.,5,2014,01,02
218,Overnight Stay,"My wife and I stayed one night at a wedding reception and were very pleased with everything connected with the visit. The service, location, food, staff friendliness and help were all first class. The gardens are well worth a visit, unfortunately on our visit it started to rain just as we were walking around the gardens and had to return to the hotel.
Also the history of the building prior to its transformation into an hotel is very interesting.",5,2014,01,02
218,dreadful service,"had sunday lunch in jacks bar and could not believe that service could be so bad.
for a 4 star establishment they need to spend time on staff training.
we ordered drinks, and waited over 20 minutes for them, however when they did arrive it was not our order...and so it went on....one of us ordered a 10 ounce sirloin steak, and got roast beef and mash. we asked where the side order of vegetables were for our mains. and received them approx. 15 minutes after we got our main courses.The table was not cleared at all, and in fact we had to ask them to clear empty glasses etc.. however when we asked for the bill it arrived very promptly.Its a pity as the food was good, however a  trip to a catering school is required here to improve service.. they were just all over the place with not one person knowing what was going on.good service is essential in any business but especially in the hotel industry, as there is a lot of competition out there.....guys you need to up the anti....",2,2013,12,30
218,christmass party,"Had Christmass party last night, Poor menu, plenty expensive, humourless staff, capri grill would have been better,Flash venue but that is where it ended.  We have previously  gone to the Ballymore Inn and then on to Naas so i don,t think we will be back.",2,2013,12,14
218,Christy Moore Gig,"We did not stay at this hotel on the night just went to a Christy Moore Gig and eat in their bar. The intention was to get a bit of bar food before the gig. The hotel itself is impressive, very nice and well maintained. Staff seemed a bit under pressure in the bar but generally service was good. My problem is that on the night they were not serving bar food and only a very expensive and limited menu in the bar. I ordered the steak €27 and it was very disappointing it was small, a bit tough and over cooked. The gig was great and the atmosphere in the bar after was also good. There was good music also provided in the bar after the gig. Unfortunately our night ended with having to provide assistance to a young lady allegedly knocked out by her husband in the lobby. Not the hotels fault but the situation was well handled by the hotel staff.",3,2013,12,10
218,"Beautiful food, top class service","Wow - went here for an event recently and was so impressed - the food was out of this world -best food I've ever had at a function where there's such a vast number to feed - you'd never have guessed - they even came around with second helpings to everyone. The service and the staff were a real credit, very professional and you felt really treated and spoilt - already planning a trip back and plan to stay next time - the building itself is stunning and looks so grand when you walk in!",5,2013,12,08
218,A 4 star hotel with 5 star quality.,"Stayed in Killeshee House Hotel for 3 nights bed and breakfast and dinner in November. A beautiful Victoran Manor House with beautiful landscaped gardens. Everything about our stay was first class. Loved every minute of iy. Staff were very friendly and helpful at all times,especially at reception and Jacks Bistro. Met a lovely friendly Polish girl in Bistro.excellent food. We spent a great day at Kildare Village and Newbridge silverware and then back to the comfort of Killeshee. And top of that it was excellent value. Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2013,12,06
218,Lovely hotel,"Easy access form Dublin, This is a very big hotel and is very popular for weddings so you can find yourself in the in the middle of several different wedding groups. Lovely rooms in a very historic building and an excellent restaurant all supported by friendly staff. Worth a short visit.",4,2013,12,03
218,Lovely hotel but you don't get that special feeling,"I recently spent two nights in Killashee House hotel as a pre-baby moon present from my husband. The package included two nights B&B one evening meal and two treatments in the onsite spa. The hotel itself is lovely and has beautiful grounds although we didn't get to walk them due to bad weather. I did have very high hopes for my stay as I had heard lovely things about it. 
However, on arrival on Friday afternoon it took us nearly 30 mins to check in due to a large wedding party also checking in at the same time. We requested a quiet room away from the noise of the wedding which we got but it was also a very long walk to get back to the main part of the hotel and slightly confussing as well (up and down various lifts and along two different long corridors). The room itself was large and comfortable to a point. Main issue i had was the room was cold and very badly laid out. There was insufficient radiators in both the bedroom and the bathroom to provide enough heat to heat up the rooms. There was a small dimplex radiator in the corner but in a 4* hotel you should not need one of these heaters and they really do dry out the air in the room very fast. Also on the Saturday evening we went back to our room to watch a movie at 8.30 and by 9pm the radiators were cold. There was no mini bar or even a bottle of water in the rooom either. The bed was very comfortable though but the towels were definitely not 4* quality - small and very flat!
The food in the bar was good, we had both evening meals in there and were very satisfied with our food and its service. The breakfast was fine, not a huge choice but plenty of everything that was on offer.
I had one spa treatment on the Friday of arrival - a facial and it was lovely although it is a pity that hotel guests have to walk through a car park beside the hotel bins to get to the Spa. My second appointment was a mini pedicure and this was just adequate. The spa itself it lovely and would definitely go back, just not for a mini pedicure.
Because the hotel had a large wedding on both Friday and Saturday there was no place to really relax and read a paper/book in peace (outside of the bar that had the television on showing sport) other than your bedroom. This is where you don't get that special feeling - the hotel is very popular for weddings but if you are a guest that isn't involved with the wedding then your needs are slightly overlooked.
Another bug bearer of mine is key cards. The hotel issued us two key cards on check in on the Friday and when we arrived back to our room on Saturday afternoon neither of them would allow us access to our room. It is hugely annoying when this happens and it is completely down to poor systems. We managed to get into our room (cleaning staff let us in) but had to make two phone calls and wait for nearly 30 mins for reception to deliver new cards. On checkout on Sunday we again had to wait nearly 30 mins as the guests from the wedding the night before were also checking out. The bill was also not correct and we had to go through each item with them before we were happy.
Overall we did have a relaxing weekend but I won't be rushing back to Killashee as I think there are definitely better hotels out there that you do get that ""special feeling"" when you are a guest that is not part of a wedding party.",3,2013,11,27
218,Amazing!!!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed one night here and we were truly overwhelmed by how stunning and beautiful this hotel was
Upon arrival we were given an upgrade to a suite in the old house! The room was absolutely massive and stunning!! Finished off by a four poster bed! 
The hotel staff could not be more helpful when we rang for a hairdryer someone was there in two minutes!! 
As part of our package we had dinner on jacks restaurant! It's a relaxed atmosphere and really was one of the nicest places I have eaten! After dinner we took a walk around the beautiful grounds of the hotel 
We also visited the spa for a massage an experience I would recommend for anyone! 
I felt like a celebrity all weekend and it was a feeling I will never forget 
I will be telling everyone to visit this hotel!!",5,2013,11,25
218,Mr Patrick Mccrum ,"Have been to alot of Hotels for gigs and This place from the moment you drive up To the Hotel Its like Wonder land all Wrapped into one Bubble. 
My self and girlfriend won this prize and my God .*from the Food to the bedroom and the staff 'Its All to real to be true. ..! Just Amazing To be in a place of welcome and that warm feeling.....All throughout the Visit. ..TOP MARKS WITHOUT A DOUBT...!! !",5,2013,11,23
218,"Great hotel, great food and funky atmosphere.","I have stayed at Killashee hotel many times and eaten there a lot also. The hotel in a very warm relaxed yet funky place to be. You can have a nice quiet stay and meal here or you can have a get together with friends and also have great fun, the bar is very smart and the staff are very pleasant. The food is great and plentiful and always in abundance. I look forward to my next visit.",5,2013,11,22
218,Amazing staff cancelled out some small problems,"Stayed here for one night on a spa break.  We were able to check in early and were warmly welcomed.  The lobby and reception areas of the hotel are really beautiful, like something from Downton Abbey.  Our room was fine, a little dated and worn, but clean and comfortable.  The TV was old with only about 8 channels and no on-demand (you can rent DVD's in reception!)   The bathroom was a good size but the rubber seal on the door of the shower was worn away so we ended up with water all over the floor every time we used it.

The spa was completely booked out so I'd recommend making a reservation in advance.  Also its worth noting the spa/gym/pool are in a completely different building that you have to walk across the car park to get to, so bring transit clothes!

The biggest issue was at night. The room (like many Irish hotels) was very warm with no aircon so we had to open the window. Our room looked out on the central courtyard which is bordered on one side by the main function room so we could hear wedding music playing until 02:30 in the morning which was a pity as we didnt get the weekend break sleep we were so hoping for!!  Breakfast was delicious.

The one thing though that far outdid any problems were the amazing staff.  They could not have been more helpful, friendly and genuinely interested in making your stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible.  And its for that reason that I rated it 4 stars and would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2013,11,21
218,I loved it!,"I recently stayed at Killashee House for two nights with my husband.  Check-in went smoothly, check-in staff were very friendly and we were shown to our room by a porter who carried our bags.  This was very helpful as the hotel is huge and we may have struggled to find our room otherwise.  The room was fantastic with a huge comfortable bed and a beautiful bathroom with separate bath, very powerful shower and double sinks.  The room was situated to the rear of the hotel so it was very quiet.

On the first night we ate in Jack’s Bistro and were given a quiet table in the corner.  The food was delicious and quite reasonable priced and again staff were very polite and helpful.  On the second night we ate in Turner’s Restaurant.  The food was excellent, beautifully presented and the staff were lovely.  Breakfast was fantastic with a great selection of cereals, fruits etc. and various cooked options.  As the hotel was extremely busy I was concerned that we may have to queue for breakfast and but there were no such issues and you weren’t at all being rushed by staff to vacate tables.

The pool facilities were great.  Towels and locker keys were provided. One previous review I read commented on how cold the pool was.  It is lukewarm and feels cold when first entering but once you are in, the water temperature is fine.

Overall, my stay at Killashee House was fabulous.  The hotel is in a beautiful building full of character – I would thoroughly recommend it for a relaxing break and would love to go back.",5,2013,11,19
218,Fabulous Stay,I recently stayed at Killashee House Hotel for an overnight stay due to a training course in the hotel. My room was lovely & spotlessly clean. Turn Down service offered which was unexpected but a nice touch. Ate in the bar & the food was really good. Breakfast excellent - cooked to order which is nice and very rare at the moment. All staff extremely friendly. Would definitely return!,5,2013,11,09
218,Beautiful hotel,We had our wedding here in September 2012 the staff couldn't be more helpful.  Nothing was an issue for them. The food was fantastic  and the house cocktails on arrival were a huge hit. We stayed in the honeymoon suite it has a huge 4 poster bed in it and we were left some treats like macaroons in the room.  There is a fab free standing bath in the bathroom. The whole day went off without a hitch and the staff were excellent.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone for a nice break away or for a wedding. ,5,2013,11,06
218,Brrrrrr!!,"Hotel was lovely, room was very comfortable and the sheets were crisp and fresh. We ate in Jack's bistro. The atmosphere was lovely and we had a delicious meal. All in all would love to come back but for the pool. My 3 year old had been looking forward to it so much but after a few minutes he was shivering with cold as were we. Chatting to a few others in the pool we were all in agreement on the temperature - not pleasant. If the pool temperature gets sorted out I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to family and friends but until then.....",4,2013,11,03
218,Loved it!,"We were sent to Ireland for a show and didn't choose where we would be lodging - and we were blown away to see Killashee House before us as our driver pulled in!  The grounds are beautiful, our bedroom suite was impeccable and the staff was awesome.  Definitely check out the Snug if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night.  It seems to be that there are a number of weddings booked at the hotel - if you're up drinking late at night, you'll probably run into those crowds.  Our room was all the way at the end of the Grayden wing so I didn't really have to worry about loud crowds.

Turner's and Jack's are fine enough for foods if you want something easy, but definitely check out the other restaurants in Naas - it would definitely be worth taking a taxi into town if you don't have your own car.

I unfortunately didn't get a chance to check out the spa as I'd hoped, but I did check out the Leisure Center.  It's actually more like the city's gym, so it was both larger and more crowded than I had anticipated on a Wednesday evening.  That being said, it was a pretty impressive facility!",5,2013,11,03
218,A perfect wedding,"My daughter Grace and her fiancée Terry had there wedding in the killashee house hotel on August 9th.Myself my husband and my two sons and two daughters and my daughters fiancée all stayed in the hotel for a week so we really experienced all aspects of the hotel.I can honestly say we found everything about this hotel to be perfect.the beds and bed linen where superb the the dining room for breakfast and dinner excellent.In fact there are very few hotels that serve your breakfast to your table which had beautiful white linen even for breakfast.Myself and the girls used the spa and beauty salon for treatments and makeup and the hairdressers for our hair for the wedding,thanks girls you did a great job.the boys used the gym and pool which they said where well equiped.As far as the wedding is concerned it was an absolutely perfect day thanks to all the hard work of the staff.the food was superb guests are still talking about the beef and the fact that they where asked time and time again if they would like more of anything on the menu.finally I would like to thank ALL THE. STAFF and I mean ALL THE STAFF.They where the most helpful friendly group of people I have ever met working for one company.No matter what you asked them the reply was always yes of course no problem.I  would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone for what ever reason ,wedding ,holiday, short or long stay.You will not be disappointed.",5,2013,11,03
218,Very pleasant,Stopped off here for an afternoon lunch. Food was good and there was a bit of a buzz about the hotel with lots of activity. Staff were attentive and food was good. Did not stay overnight on this occasion.,4,2013,11,03
218,Flawless.,"My wife and I were married here last week and from the moment we stayed to the moment we left it was faultless.  The staff, the food, the rooms, all of it was perfect. Every single member of staff literally bent over backwards to make every single detail flawless. Special mention has to go to the wedding coordinators and Nigel the banqueting manager who really did go the extra mile. I would recommend this to anyone planning a wedding and look forward to going back!",5,2013,10,31
218,Great hotel with excellent service,"I stayed recently in this hotel and can't fault the experience. My favourite part of the stay was the hotel bar which had a great atmosphere, lovely decor & good bar food. The ingredient that made everything work was the fantastic staff there - nothing was a problem. Every staff member especially the bar manager on the night of the 12 Oct was excellent. I look forward to a return trip to the hotel.",5,2013,10,28
218,Wedding weekend to remember!,"Myself and my husband got married in the original house on Friday 25th October
What a venue- the rooms are beautifully decorated and service is second to none
Our wedding day went  by without any issues and this was all down to the amazing staff

Katie our wedding coordinator looked after everything in the run up to the big day and Nigel was the banquet manager
He was brilliant!! So attentive and always ensuring we were happy with the service and time lines of the day

We literally cannot fault anything! I would urge anyone who Is planning  a wedding to go here and view this amazing venue, you will not be disappointed

All our guests agree!",5,2013,10,28
218,Good quality with excellent evening dining,"Stayed in this hotel as part of a corporate training weekend.
Evening dining is the strongest aspect with excellent menu and service.
Rooms were good, breakfast was ok. Would say it is the best choice of hotel in naas area",4,2013,10,25
218,"5 star hotel,1 star service","Recently stayed in the hotel, all was going well until the fire alarm went off at 6am. Nobody at the front desk knew what to do, or what to advise the guests. The hotel was in disarray .

When we were checking out in the morning, the front desk staff were unprepared for our questions, and unprepared to apologies for this disruption ,

Each receptionist had a different story as to what happened(one even was trying to blame it on a guest). I was there at the desk at 6 am, and I knew it was a faulty alarm head.

Each receptionist tried to deal with the situation, some offering a refund, others nothing at all, and one offering to upgrade us to a suite when next we visit ( which will be never following all that happened).

Get your act together and you could be a great hotel",3,2013,10,20
218,"Nice treat, breakfast was tasty and staff were polite","We stayed here last week, my partner treated me. It was slightly confusing to get to the room, as it took two lifts, but not a big deal. The bed was very comfortable and shower etc was all good. We thought the tv looked a bit dated, but worked fine. We enjoyed the couples rasul treatment in the spa, really got to chill out. The breakfast was nice we had full Irish first morning, and also enjoyed the fruit, nuts and bread, and the next morning I ordered the pancakes which were delicious as were the variety of cheeses on offer. We did feel this building could definitely do with been maintained more and updated.",4,2013,10,12
218,Excellent,We were at a wedding here on Sat 28th September 2013. Stayed in a very spacious family room with my two children 9 and 5. Little extras like DVD player in the room. Staff could not do enough for them during the meal. They were particularly attentive at breakfast the next morning. Staff were kind and friendly throughout our whole stay. Food was lovely. Rooms were a bit difficult to get too but you overcome that with the wonderful atmosphere.,5,2013,10,07
218,Spa weekend,We stayed at the hotel for a relaxing spa break. The treatments were very relaxing and enjoyable and leisure facilities very good. The bed room was large with nice views of the gardens. The food was good and the staff were extremely friendly and helpfully. Discounts are available from reception for local attractions.,5,2013,09,30
218,Very quiet and relaxing,We stayed here and enjoyed the breakfast greatly. The rooms were good and the spa next door was also good. We chose this for a relaxing trip and visited some local sites. The food overall was excellent and the staff were more than helpfull,5,2013,09,29
218,Could be 4 star but isn't,"Stayed here in what was described as a deluxe room. Would not like to see a standard room!
Pros: Beds very comfortable
Bed linen is 4 star. 
Robe & slippers provided but hidden in closet 
Cons: Mold on shower tile caulk
Room very dark.
TV from dinosaur age with awful signal
TV cabinet doors broken off & not replaced.
No alarm clock
No bathroom Kleenex
Towels not bath size
No a/c 
Function room noise very annoying

Hotel's situation & grounds are magnificent but the hotel has seen better days. Carpets stained & worn near function rooms. It's a real rabbit warren with necessity to take 2 elevators & walk a long way to access certain rooms. 
Breakfast was good, hot breakfast is served & cold cuts etc are self serve. Coffee everywhere is rotten, like instant only worse.
Dinner was good, no complaints but my colleague's walnut salad had no walnuts!
Was looking forward to a luxurious stay but I've been in other properties which were far better. 
Noise from wedding function lasted into wee hours so no sleep for everyone in earshot until the band stopped. Next morning the function room area smelled damp & musty. 
All in all I would not return, which is a pity, it could & should be so much better.

218,Nice stay!,"I stayed in this hotel while attending a conference. On checking in I was told that I had received a complimentary upgrade. My room was in the old house. It was a beautiful olde world room. The decor was lovely. The only negative related to bathroom. It was tiny and had no bath. The shower controls were very difficult to regulate. I ate in bar and food was lovely, if a bit pricy. A glass of house wine was €6.50 which I consider expensive.
Breakfast was mediocre.
Any staff I encountered were lovely, really helpful and obliging. The grounds of the hotel are splendid, most attractive.",4,2013,09,28
218,Fantastic hotel,"Picked this hotel mainly for location , easy to get to and a lot of things to do close by. Had booked through the hotels website and got a great deal, twin room, dinner and breakfast for 99 euros. There were 6 of us in our group and each of us said we'll be making a return journey. We had a lovely lunch which was very reasonably priced . The twin rooms had 2 large double beds and were very clean. We had a slight problem with one of our main meals but this was dealt with efficiently by the restaurant manager. Good atmosphere in the bar afterwards, overall great stay. One tip, get up for breakfast on time as there was a queue out the door, not great when you have as hangover but there was a table set up with tea and coffee to have as you queued.  ",5,2013,09,21
218,Old School,"Whilst i have no problem with old world feel hotels i do have a problem with them not staying someway up to date. On check in i was informed i had been upgraded to a better room in the hotel. The room whilst spacious and clean and i must also say a very large,comfy bed had a old tube telly not much bigger than a laptop screen. As i was tired after a long day of meetings i was happy just to sit down and watch a bit of soccer. Unfortunately the channel had not been tuned in. 9 minus 1 are not sufficient for a four star hotel.",3,2013,09,20
218,Fantastic Wedding Day,"We had our wedding reception here on the 29th of August in the Original House and we had such a fantastic day. Both our families were bowled over by the place! The staff could not do enough for us and the duty manager who looked after us on the day was exceptional. The wedding coordinator made sure every little detail was in place, from the set up of the house to the design of the wedding menu. We loved everything. There were beautiful rose petals and tea lights scattered about the place. It was perfect! The canapés were really tasty and were beautifully presented.The wedding meal was delicious and again, the presentation was outstanding. 

The gardens are beautiful and we got some really great photos. We were lucky to get good weather and myself and my husband had some lovely moments wandering through the gardens on our own whilst our guests were being seated for dinner. 

Although the venue is beautiful in itself, the staff really make this place. They interacted with our guests throughout the whole day and made them feel very welcome. For example, when the band /DJ had wrapped up for the evening, a member of staff brought down a small set of speakers so that one of our guests could play music from his laptop which was brilliant. Our guests partied away into the early hours of the morning. Wish we could have kept our eyes open for longer as we didn't want to miss a thing but we headed to bed around 3am. Needless to say, there were plenty of sore heads in the morning!!

We also decided to stay a second night and moved into the hotel. We were given a beautiful room and couldn't complain. The wedding coordinator organised a private room for dinner as we had some family join us for the second night also. We were really impressed with the set up of the room and again, the food was delicious. It was our bestman's birthday and we'd bought him a cake. The manager on reception that evening was so helpful and helped us hide the cake and light the candles. After dinner, we all went off to a small bar at the back of the hotel called 'The Snug' for a nightcap until it closed up for the night. On our way back to our rooms, a really friendly guy at the residents bar upstairs persuaded us to have a drink and not go to bed. Needless to say, it was another late night!! Just another few examples of how wonderful the staff are.

If you are having your wedding here in the upcoming future, lucky you! If not, you should consider Killashee House as it is the perfect venue for a wedding :) We are already planning a return trip for our 1 month anniversary.  Any excuse!",5,2013,09,18
218,Best wedding ever!!!,I had my wedding here on the 7th of September. Everything went really well and we really enjoyed the day.  The wedding co ordinator made the lead up to the wedding a breeze and on the day the DM made sure everything went smoothy. I have absolutely no complaints.  We had our reception in the original house and would highly recommend. ,5,2013,09,17
218,Filthy Dirty - Be warned,"Shockingly bad.

I stayed here on a weeknight and I honestly couldn’t wait to get out of that bedroom. At one stage just before heading to bed, I thought about sleeping in the car. Here’s why …

The room was dirty. There was a musty smell when I entered the room. I was uneasy right away. I checked over the bed and there was thick dust – See the photos I have submitted. I couldn’t believe it! In this day and age … for a four star hotel to have nearly a half inch sheet of dust on top of the bed is unacceptable.

The room itself was old fashioned and in need of a deep clean. I hope the manager does not reply with excuses about the dust – Pictures don’t lie. I’m horrified. The room had a large four-post bed with curtains. The dirt and dust was on top of this structure.

I ordered room service to the room. I was disappointed. I ordered steak and chips but it was cold and not tasty when it arrived. Oh! Why did I stay here? A bloody hostel would be better than this.

I will never ever stay in this hotel every again.
Maybe the manager will reply and say that it was bad luck that I got an old dirty, dusty room. No excuses. Someone should loose their job for the condition of that room. 

Again, I point you to the photos I have submitted. You won’t believe it!",1,2013,09,16
218,Distinctly Average,"We stayed here recently for one night, and i have to say found the experience depressing! The hotel has obviously been extended recently, and it reminds me of somewhere like Citywest i.e. Soulless and Vast!!.....Decor inside and out was generally shabby, mainly in the common areas and corridors. 
The food at breakfast wasn't great, and overall the staff were not particularly friendly or professional. 
Overall, compared to every other hotel in Ireland I've stayed in recently - this is the one I'd least recommend. Not terrible, but far from great.",3,2013,09,11
218,Lovely Hotel Great Staff,Had a company day here recently. Had lunch and then events outside followed by BBQ and drinks. From the start everything was lovely. From the planning to the actual event we had great help from the staff at the hotel.  The could'nt do enough for us on the day either. Brilliant.  Rooms are beautiful and very clean. Bed are really comfortable too. Certainly reccommend this to all - families too.  Grounds are really lovely and well maintained. Food in the bar and the restaurant is really good too. Well worth a visit,5,2013,09,10
218,Naas,"Stayed here for a wedding for two nights really had a great time.  I loved the location very nicely decorated with a high standard of quality and comfort.  The food both at the wedding and in the bar was excellent,  The staff were very nice.  The breakfast was a real treat.  I would love to stay again.",4,2013,09,08
218,super break,"This was a 3 day break as part of a 2 week tour of Ireland and I have to say we thought it was right up there as one of the best hotels anywhere in the world we have stayed--everything about the hotel and it's fabulous leisure centre (housed in a separate building) is luxurious--we thoroughly enjoyed our stay--from the reception staff to the maids the staff were so efficient, friendly and helpful and up for a bit of craic!! Each time we asked directions to local attractions we were presented with a typed slip giving all the info we needed--and usually a discount voucher--eg Japanese gds-2 for 1 entry
The bedrooms were excellent -spacious, very comfortable beds and beautifully decorated-our only minor gripe --it was quite a hike to get to the room!!-we were in 227. 
The food was superb-we were on a 'golden days ' deal and expected a restricted menu-but no it was the full 4 course menu--the bar /restaurant staff were 1st class--some how they picked up on the fact that my wife had just had a birthday and produced a special birthday sweet plate
this was 3 days of pampered luxery which we will savour for a long time--thank you killyshee.",5,2013,09,04
218,Afternoon Tea,I recently had afternoon tea at Killashee house hotel. 5 of us shared 2 platters. The food was wonderful and the service was good. Excellent value and a lovely treat for my aunt visiting from England.I would highly recommend it.,5,2013,09,04
218,like a bus station-wedding only hotel.,"Went for one night with my mother. Hotel is now dated and run down. Crazy busy with wedding and if you are not part of a wedding crew staff have no interest. Rooms are tacky and dirty-not suprised to see stories of mice in hotel. Noise from wedding party at night.The closure of nuns kitchen is a big loss and its replaced with jacks bar which lacks any atmosphere. Staff are walking around aimlessly - they seem very young and inexperienced. Cocktalls were awful. Had dinner in Turners and it was very disappointing. Nothing matched the decription on menu. Breakfast consisted of a very poor and cheap selection. Staff couldnt care less and its run like a busy station, in and out. Never again.",1,2013,09,03
218,Wonderful spa,"I used the spa for a treat. Had a wonderful head and neck massage and the relaxation room does exactly what is says on the box. Staff were lovely, friendly but not too chatty. Would recommend if you are staying in the hotel or a local.",5,2013,09,01
218,Killashee House ruine my wedding!!,"If I could give this hotel a worse rating than I would. My husband and I were married in Ireland and had my family there with us. My mom booked a nice small ""reception"" for the 5 of us and a couple of rooms.The hotel was very aware that we were a wedding and we were celebrating here. We pulled up in our car and there was another bride outside taking pictures, that didn't bother us at all. We went to check in and were quickly ushered to the bar area and we were told that they weren't aware of a third wedding going on that night (apparently there was another reception somewhere else). The senior manager came back ( I wish I knew his name) and told me that it was completely unacceptable to be in my wedding dress and I had to change now. Well my luggage was with my parents who hadn't arrived yet. He told me he could check us in and we could go to our room and we would have to stay in there until I could change. I asked him why and he said their wedding contracts agree that only 2 weddings can be on the premises and that the brides will never see each other. He left and we were ushered into a room farther back and all doors were barricaded by staff. There was no exit for us. Multiple staff members kept coming back telling me we had to leave. One finally admitted that they did have us down as a wedding but there must have been a mistake. After the manager continue to yell at me and many tears and an hour went by my parents arrived. I told them what was happening and she told me to go to the lobby with her to get a refund. As I was walking to the lobby I had 5 or 6 staff members that were physically trying to push me out of the hotel and telling me I can't be here. They told my mom that if my husband and I went outside to a parking lot farthest away from the building they would help us get reservations for a dinner and a hotel. My husband and I were stuck standing outside in a parking lot filled with bees for over an hour...Finally my mom came out with reservations. No one took the opportunity to even apologize to her or us saying this was our fault and I was going to ruin the other brides' weddings when we were going to have our dinner which wasn't even near the other receptions, have a couple drinks and retire to bed. When we arrive to our dinner, it was in some run down cafe when Killashee house said it was the  nicest restaurant in town. The food was alright, but luckily service was amazing, 100x better than Killashee house. We arrive to our hotel and my dad goes in to check in. The hotel was connected to a night club, my dad asked about this to see if it would be that loud all night and the guy told him he told Killashee house to let us know they were connected to a hotel. Luckily the hotel we were sent to helped us get to another hotel. It was very run down and not up to date but the only thing within an hour drive. Killashee House is the rudest place I've been. They just want what will bring in the most money. Unfortunately, they lost out on ours. I am glad I left and didn't change. Please take this as a warning, these people are rude, not sophisticated and were even physically pushing us. Don't waste your money here.",1,2013,08,31
218,"Terrible Experience - THIS IS A WEDDING HOTEL ONLY, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE","Terrible experience with the Killashee House hotel.  Be aware that this hotel mainly caters to weddings yet they do not tell the average guest this.  My daughter got married in Ireland and I booked two rooms at the hotel for that night.  Not having known that they have a policy of only having two brides at the hotel at a time, my daughter arrived at the hotel in her wedding dress to have dinner and go to her room only to be practically accosted by the staff, ushered to a back room and told it was unacceptable for her to be there in her dress.  Mind you, I told them this was for a honeymoon when I booked the rooms and was NEVER told about the wedding policy.  I can not describe to you how emotionally devastating this was to her and of course to her family.  Of course I refused to stay at the hotel after that type of treatment and asked for assistance in getting other hotel arrangements.  Well, they did that but they neglected to tell us that the hotel they found for us was attached to a nightclub that was open until 3:00 am.  When we found this out we found the only other accommodations in town and ended  up in a hole in the wall hotel by train tracks.  The whole experience with Killashee was horrendous.  Their website pictures area also misleading.  It is not as calm and serene as the pictures show, there is barely no parking and there are so many people at the hotel it is crazy.  

After this experience it felt like our whole vacation to Ireland was ruined and we were seriously thinking of flying home early, but the next night we went to Waterford castle and I have to say they saved our trip and my daughters wedding as much as could be saved.  Their customer service is out of this world as is their food and their accommodations.  Also, their website pictures are exactly what you get.  If you are going to be staying in Ireland, I would HIGHLY recommend Waterford and definitely DIS-recommend Killashee.  I just cannot express how emotionally devastating the experience at Killashee was and people really need to be sure you know what you are getting when you book here.  This is a wedding hotel only and not for the traveler who wants relaxation.  The staff's customer service was abhorrent and the marketing they do is false.",1,2013,08,31
218,Wedding Day in Killashee,"I got married in Killashee House on the 19th of July 2013 and I just wanted to say that our experience in Killashee was amazing from start to finish. Katie the Wedding Coordinator was brilliant and helped to take the stress out of the day. It was the hottest day of the year and the staff,especially Nigel and his team, went out of their way to make sure that all our guests were comfortable and that they enjoyed their stay. I can't say enough good things about the hotel but in particular all the guests mentioned how beautiful the gardens were, how friendly the staff were and how amazing the food was. Its very difficult to cater for 250 guests and they made it look easy. We had a barbeque the following evening in the hotel and that too was lovely and we really couldn't have been happier with the whole experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a wedding or even just a weekend away.",5,2013,08,28
218,Lovely experience !,"We stayed on this hotel for one night (plus full day after) for a wedding. Room was nice, food really good, surrounding gardens were lovely (for garden lovers like us), wedding itself was superb and staff was friendly and very helpful. But what especially made our stay amazing was baby-sitter (Ann) who minded our 3 month old baby during the 3 hour long dinner of the wedding. We got Ann through the hotel and she was amazing; the type of person you immediately feel comfortable leaving your ""almost new-born baby"" with but you also feel like asking her advice on babies in general, she was truly amazing - every baby should have granny like her.",5,2013,08,27
218,A June Wedding at Killashee House Hotel,"I had my wedding reception for 120 guests in Killashee House Hotel on June 20th 2013.  From the very beginning of the planning process, the wedding coordinators were fantastic.  Every single question I had was answered and I had regular phone and email contact with the wedding team.  On the day, we were lucky to have beautiful weather, and we arrived to an outdoor drinks reception.  The bridal party was met with a champagne and red carpet reception, and while myself and my husband were taken off to the gardens by our photographer for some outdoor shots, our guests enjoyed their welcome cocktails and canapes outdoors in the sunshine.  (There are beautiful rooms inside the hotel to enjoy the drinks reception and to have photos taken if the weather is bad).
We are still receiving compliments on our wedding meal.  It was an absolute feast.  Myself and my husband had been treated to a complimentary menu and wine tasting a month beforehand so we knew that we were in for a delicious meal.  Our guests had Mediterranean soup to start, followed by a goats cheese and sundried tomato tart.  The main course consisted of a choice between chicken and beef (there were many other alternatives but those were our favourites at the menu tasting), and we had chosen a chocolate mousse for dessert.  The staff could not do enough for our guests during the meal, guests told us that they were given seconds (and thirds!) and even those who ordered chicken were given an opportunity to try the beef and vice versa.  The wine also flowed continuously throughout the meal, and no glasses went empty.
The coordination and planning on the day was excellent, I was in close contact with the events manager throughout the day who kept me informed of our schedule.  Everything ran exactly as planned.
We stayed in the hotel that night and had a barbecue the following evening.  It was lovely to have the extra day with our guests to relax and chat.  We had our wedding on a Thursday, which was less expensive than having a weekend wedding and left us extra money to be able to book out both the grand ballroom and the old house, ensuring that ours was the only wedding on the day and we had exclusive use of the facilities (although we were assured that if we chose the ballroom or the old house on its own, and a second wedding was held on the same day, there would be two separate wedding teams and one wedding party would not in any way be hindered by another).  We had our welcome drinks served in the old house and our reception meal in the grand ballroom.  We were also given exclusive use of the bedrooms in the old house, which are all unique and have a wonderful vintage feel.  There are twelve bedrooms in the old house and they were all booked by our bridal party.
I couldn't recommend Killashee House Hotel highly enough for a wedding or for a night or weekend away, and I'm sure we will be back to celebrate our anniversary!",5,2013,08,27
218,Compares to the branded hotels,"Very nice property, spacious rooms, well decorated. Very friendly and helpful staff, Emma in particular, who went out of her way to make our stay very pleasant.
The location is slightly isolated but not too far from the town of Naas. It compensates with a beautiful garden and green areas. 
The spa and pool are in a different building next to the hotel and close a tad too early for the long summer days.
All in all it compares to the branded chains in quality and service. Kudos as that is not easy in Ireland.",4,2013,08,22
218,Fab Wedding,"Just home from a fabulous wedding at this lovely hotel. The banqueting staff are to be commended for their attentive service, really enjoyed a great day. Stayed in a beautiful room and all staff were very welcoming and friendly especially Nicki. Only fault was no hot water in the shower the next morning but staff acknowledged this and were getting it fixed straight away.",4,2013,08,18
218,Simply Wonderful,"I attended our niece Grace and Terry's wedding on 9th August last and what a wonderful experience it was, from start to finish. We stayed for three nights. The hotel is very well maintained throughout, and spotlessly clean. The staff were excellent throughout the whole weekend. Nothing was a problem for them and everything was done with a smile. The room we stayed in was really lovely with a very high standard of cleanliness. The bed was extremely comfortable with beautiful white bed linen. The wedding reception was truly amazing, especially the food. We dined in Turners Restaurant on the night following the wedding and it was fab. 
The hotel grounds are really beautiful and we enjoyed some lovely walks. I had my hair and makeup done in the Villa Spa on the morning of the wedding and they did a great job. The staff there were also lovely. My brother had his wedding here 10 years ago and I was amazed that the standard of service was just as good as it was then. Well done to everyone, from management to porters, a truly wonderful experience.",5,2013,08,18
218,Perfect in every way!,"We spent a beautiful weekend in this fabulous hotel, celebrating the marriage of my friends Grace and Terry. 
From the moment we arrived to our departure, we were treated to 5 star hospitality. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff of this hotel. They made us feel very special without any air off stuffiness, just a friendly attitude at all times.
The hotel is beautiful!  The gardens are lovely too. 
We had a deluxe suite, for three sharing. It was very big and comfortable. The linen felt very luxurious and it was spotlessly clean. 
Our package included breakfast and evening meals, all of which were delicious. 
The highlight of the weekend, was of course the wedding reception. The service was incredible! I could not believe the quality of the food, with such a large number of people to serve! They made this occasion very special for Grace and Terry. Everything ran so smoothly and the atmosphere was perfect.  I hope one day I will have a chance to return to the truly lovely hotel. Until then, I will have treasured memories of a very special occasion, spent with very special people in Killashee House Hotel. Perfect in every way!",5,2013,08,16
218,Lovely Spa Experience,"Stayed in Killashee house several times over the last few years, never any problems, used the pool and gym area, this time only used the Spa, great experience, my one tiny, tiny complaint is why have you combined the gym desk and the spa desk together?, standing at the desk behind members sorting out their membership a lovely lady called Dolores, asked me was I okay, told her I  was using the Spa, and she directed me to another lovely lady called Sharon, who sorted me out for my treatment, Management: please go back to separate desks, ( more privacy ) but well done Killashee spa on your award.",5,2013,08,16

218,Seen the rest now go to the Best!!,"Well,where to start, went to my niece Grace's wedding to Terry arrived at Hotel fab.approach stunning building & grounds.
I could spend ages singing the praises of various departments individually but easier to say EVERYBODY is 5 star .
Someone at the top has set the example of how to do their job with a smile genuine interest in the customers requirements and carrying them out as if it really isn't a problem.
The wedding dinner was AMAZING!
I have eaten all over the world 5stars etc, and if I had been in a Michelin star fine dine restaurant and been served this meal the cost would be secondary, a special mention for the Beef main course OMG !
Well could go on & on but all to say is go there !!!!
Special mention this young man went the extra Mile all weekend , the great smile, the wonderful manners and helpfull demeanour the very smart dress sense MAX you could go a long way in the Hotel Business good luck & thank you.

218,Amazing hotel,"Arrived late Monday eve after a bit of a drama at the hotel we had originally booked! Staff were so friendly and helpful in getting us sorted ASAP as I had our 5 month old baby tucked under my arm. Had a lovely meal in jacks bar both nights we were there. Grounds are amazing and the leisure facilities are super - like a full leisure centre and spa on site. Catered for families perfectly but also would be ideal for a couples retreat. The hotel is HUGE so it's a bit of a walk to some of the rooms but its so grand, well kept and clean that we didn't mind this at all. Lovely staff in all areas of the hotel and Great value for money - if we are ever in this area again we would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,08,14
218,Asolutely amazing hotel!!,"Our suite was amazing. The bed was so comfortable. Customer service was just amazing. All the staff are so helpful and pleasant. The facilities were second to none. Fabulous pool sauna and steamroom..they provide towels, swim hats, wet bags for your wet clothes. Proper hair dryers too. I have to say I honestly have never stayed in a nicer hotel! Will definitely be going back!!",5,2013,08,05
218,Great for a girlie spa treat,"My sister & I had Deal Rush vouchers for spa treatments st the Villa Spa at Killashee House & decided to really treat ourselves by staying overnight as well. The spa voucher was for a full body massage, scalp massage, mini facial & dry flotation therapy each. We both opted for an add-on of a salt scrub. Our spa experience was wonderful, the spa staff were thoroughly professional. The dry flotation therapy was new to both of us & was simply wonderful! Now for my review of the hotel. Lovely building but a complete maze! To get to our bedroom we got the lift up one floor walked along several corridors then got another lift down. Finding our way to the spa from our room was difficult & finding our way back again was worse! We dined early in Jack's Bar, a lovely experience, lovely friendly & helpful staff. Food was good & not too expensive. On retiring early to our room we discovered that there was no pay per view movie option but the services book said there was a list of DVD's to choose from. We ordered a DVD but there was no DVD player in the room!! So another member of staff arrived with a DVD player but no scart lead! We gave up! There was no mini-bar & no bottled water in the room. Strangely there were slippers but no robes in the room. The beds were very comfortable. We would stay again if visiting the excellent Villa Spa again",4,2013,08,04
218,Great hotel and reasonable price,"Staff lovely, food exceptional, atmosphere relaxed. We stayed for one night only but everything from check in to leisure centre , breakfast etc was really nice.i don't think I've stayed in a hotel where staff were nicer. Loved the grounds and the lobby",5,2013,07,31
218,Afternoon Tea is Great Here,Dined here on several occasions and the food & service is always really good. Yesterday went with a friend for afternoon tea and it was best i've had anywhere. When we arrived our table wasn't ready as they'd been really busy but within 10 mins we were seated having had several apologies for the wait. The sandwichs and cakes were really good and the scones were amazing. The only fault was only 1 tiny pot of jam and small portion of cream given between us (you'd need 2 as there wasn't enough to share) but when we requested extra it was no problem. The cups are very plain for afternoon tea but overall we'll def be back. Also special thanks to Michelle on reception who helped us with other queries. She's an asset to the hotel.,4,2013,07,29
218,Really well run hotel,"A belated review- we stayed here for 2 nights when my nephew got married in the hotel in May 2013.  From the beginning the staff were great- very friendly but professional .  We had lunch on our own in the bar when we arrived- I have been back in Ireland many times with my husband over the last 10 years and have been constantly ripped off eating out in Ireland - not so here, our smoked salmon salad with brown bread was delicious - and great value - for then on it got even better, great wedding, fab food, lovely venue and good service - highly recommended.",5,2013,07,28
218,Bit of a disappointment to say the least!,"Gave 3 night break as a  present to family friends and boy was I embarrassed! -we came home vert disappointed!  I have stayed on a couple of occasions before was happy with my stay but not this time.  While the bedroom was nice and spacious, the  camp bed in the room was very uncomfortable - none of the family members could sleep on it as it was really hard so no-one used it after the first few hours on the first night!  Also the food was very disappointing - mouldy toast and fruit that was positively rank and surrounded by flies one morning for breakfast!  I was shocked!  It was ok the following 2 mornings.  Dinner was only very mediocre - the steak, while tender was completely cold.  Sorry...could not recommend this hotel anymore - I think it's completely over priced now!",3,2013,07,28
218,Disappointing to say the least,"As friends we decided to treat ourselfs to a day at KILLASHEE HOUSE HOTEL for a couple of spa treatments and lunch. We checked into the spa as required 15 minutes before hand. We were met by a lovely receptionist and shown to the changing room's.Lovely robe and slippers awaited us.Great we taught. Alas no. After. we changed I went to the loo only for the whole toilet to move from the floor. Im 9 stone. Ok then we had to wait in the hall with other clients to be shown to our treatment room's upstairs. Which were ok not 4 star by any means. After treatments we were shown to the juice bar water only no ice no clean glasses. We gave up went to the bar for lunch. Staff not busy but took 15 minutes to take our order. We ate outside. Food Menu expensive but we were having a treat so no worries on that front , but it was as bland as   could be, tasteless is the best way to describe it. We didn't even bother to have dessert or coffee. Staff were to busy chatting between themselves to notice our discomfort and even if they did they showed no intention of coming over to us to enquire was every thing ok. What a disapppointing we had we wont rush back. We would have had a better lunch with better service from our local take-a-way. No we did not lea",3,2013,07,27
218,Excellent value,"My friend and I travelled on a special shoppers deal-89 euro for DBB pps. The twin room was generous in size with 2 double beds overlooking a small court yard. We had dinner in the bar which could be ordered from the main daily bar menu with no restrictions, dinner was delicious with excellent service throughout.
The beds were very comfortable and very clean, small toiletries were provided, although I did think the towels were of a poor quality for an establishment such as this.
Breakfast in the morning was good with a wide variety to choose from and hot food available to order from the menu, again excellent service.
A very enjoyable trip, with a 10% discount card for Kildare outlet village as part of the package!",4,2013,07,26
218,Weekend away with the girls,"Spent two nights in Kilashee House on a weekend away with the girls for shopping and relaxation in Kildare. Hotel room was lovely, large double beds and nice big airy room. Food was excellent and the spa was fantastic. Overall stay is recommended.",5,2013,07,22
218,Beautiful hotel,We stayed witht he kids the hotel itself is amazing stunning to look at with stunning gardens.  The room decor was quite dated but clean. The only fault i could say is Jacks bar we waited a very long time to order and then one main course was over we ordered icecream for kids wich took over 30 mins to come .,4,2013,07,17
218,"Nice hotel, great staff, but not a peaceful stay..","I booked a stay here for a quiet weekend break from the city. The hotel is beautiful, very nice decor, well maintained, very clean, the grounds are lovely for strolling around. The staff were exteremly polite and helpful. The food was mediocre, but we paid 38 euro for two four-course meals so it was worth the price. 

My issue, and the reason I couldn't honestly recommend this hotel, was the amount of noise at night. There was a wedding party taking place during our stay, so perhaps bad timing for us, but the whole stay was ruined by extremly loud music and drunken people making noise until past 2am; it was like staying in Temple Bar. I had wanted to come away feeling well rested but it was quite the opposite. 

Of course I was happy for the wedding party, they have a right to party on that special day, but for the price we paid here I felt really cheated out of what should have been a really relaxing night away, it was wasted money.",3,2013,07,15
218,"Slow service, disappointing food, no biscuits!!","We went to Jack's bar for our anniversary as this was the restaurant where we had our first date three years ago. We were really looking forward to the night out. When we arrived we took a table. We waited 20 minutes for some menus, & then I eventually got up & asked a staff member for some. We then waited a further 7-8 minutes to order food. My boyfriend wanted a starter with some sides- (onion rings & chips)- the staff member told us there had been a meeting with the team & chef that day and this request could not be accomodated. So he ordered the starter on its own as a main course. My dish was a pasta dish to be served with parmesan cheese & galilc bread. It came without cheese & garlic bread- I had to ask for it.  The starter came out as a starter size also. We asked could we have some tea & biscuits in the foyer & paid for them with the bill. We went out and sat in the foyer where once again we were forgotten about. I reminded a staff member that we had ordered tea & they eventually came out- with no biscuits, we asked for biscuits- Staff member said they had none, My boyfriend got very annoyed at this point so we left very disappointed.",2,2013,07,14
218,Family Weddong,"I stayed in Killashee in November last year for my brothers wedding, from start to finish everything was perfect. I stayed two nights in a spacious room with two double beds and wonderful view of the grounds. The only fault I know others had was finding their rooms. They would have to go up one lift through a corridor and down another lift. Very confusing I was told.. Lucky I didn't have this problem. The second day which happened to be my brothers birthday. I had afternoon tea which was delightful and I highly recommend. Dinner in Jack's restaurant was included in our package The staff arranged a small conference room for us to have a birthday dinner and decorated the room with balloons and banners in which was a nice touch. The food was to die for. I had the lamb shank that just melted in your mouth. I have yet to taste better!! The breakfast was cooked to order which is rare these days, at least you knew your food was freshly prepared. To top it all off we were offered complimentary late check out, which came in useful after two days and nights of celebrating.  Overall Killashee is a beautiful place to stay and staff were very friendly.",5,2013,07,07
218,Good but could do better,Had a family night away at Killashee. Lovely hotel with some great facilities. Kids enjoyed the pool and we had a nice lunch in the courtyard of the bar. The staff are friendly and it's a buzzy spot with regular wedding parties. The restaurant service in Turners needs some focus. The room is missing an experienced hand to lead the team who were a bit lost making it an ok instead of nice meal. The food itself was well liked by our group but for each course we were left waiting too long to get everyone's meal on the table. Breakfast was nice. Would go back.,4,2013,07,07
218,Went that extra mile!,"We are just back from a really enjoyable stay in Killashee. The hotel had been recommended as 'child friendly' and it was our first trip with our 14 month old without bringing his food etc. The welcome was warm, and every one of the waiting staff in the restaurant did everything they could to make sure our evening meal was exactly as we wanted it. Although we ate at 5pm, we got our full 4 course meal as part of our package and everything was done to ensure our baby was kept happy throughout.This morning we were kindly given a late check-out so that 'naptime' could be catered for. This was all with a smile and a 'No problem'. I have never written a review here before but really felt a review was deserved. We will definitely be recommending Killashee, and returning ourselves!",5,2013,07,03
218,The Perfect Day,"We had our wedding reception in Killashee this year. The day was fantastic due to the brilliant staff and beautiful venue. Every part of the day was exceptional, the grounds were fantastic for pictures,  the rooms both in the old house and new part of the hotel were beautiful, the food was delicious and the drinks and food reception rooms looked amazing. We felt completely relaxed  from the moment we arrived because we were looked after so well right from the beginning and throughout the day. We loved that we got to spend a few moments in our room, while everyone was asked to move into the reception area, we thought it was a nice touch and gave us a moment to breath and take it all in.  We didn't have to ask for anything, it felt to us that the day ran so smoothly.  All our guests loved the venue and a few have book other nights and weekends away at the hotel because they loved it so much.  It was a perfect day, exactly what you want for your wedding day. Thank you everyone at Killashee",5,2013,07,01
218,beautiful place,beautiful place to stay would highly recommend it staff were lovely the only negative thing i would say is the lifts are a bit confusing. Everything was great a lot of staff in the hotel so its nice to see so many young people working there. Room service was brilliant regardless of what time it was as we had a late night i still got a meal brought to the room.,5,2013,06,25
218,The Perfect Foil...,"To a busy day and frustrating journey. 

Having had reasonable experiences at two other hotels in Dublin (see my Camden Court review) I decided to try the countryside beyond the M50.  I was recommended two hotels - one on Dublin Bay which was full - and this one. 

I will not bore you with my tale of Ryanairs unreasonable behaviour because everyone has that to tell in various forms. Let me just say that I arrived after ten hours travelling and was slightly on edge. The sight of the hotel that greeted me took part of this away - very impressive - and then Laura on reception asked how was my day.  A few words of reply gave her the clear indication that the day had not gone well - up to then. Laura however had the remedy - a charming attitude that was like a soothing balm and when I said I needed a drink she pointed me straight to the bar and offered to look after my bag whilst I slaked the first pint or so. Not necessary Laura but  thank you. 

The room was a short journey away but, hey guys who complain that it was a schlep, how many hotels have you stayed in? Yes, the architecture of the building did not lend itself to straight lines and easy access but it was not that bad - in fact I liked it as I got the impression I was in a private wing. 

The room itself was wonderful. Large and airy with all you needed. I prefer a cool room and leaving the window open was perfect for me. The wifi was easy and strong and the tv had enough channels to satisfy all but the perfectionist couch potato

The interior was impressive and the bar friendly and roomy. It served as ""Jacks"" a restaurant and I ate there each night. My only complaint was that most seats were in poor lighting and I wanted to read. I found a great table though at the edge overlooking the gardens and went there each night. 

Now for the food - the chowder was some of the best I have ever had and I ordered it each night - yes, it was that good. Served with a lovely heavy brown wholemeal bread it is unmissable although you may want to season it to taste (that is not a criticism).

I had the fish and chips and the burger and both were very pleasant. However on the last evening I chose three starters. The liver parfait (like a pâté but lighter) was very good, but the black pudding with asparagus and egg was out of this world. 

The breakfasts were well presented and full of choice and if I had to find one criticism of the entire stay (and this is only minor) it was on the Wednesday when a manageress ( she wore black and not the red waiter/waitress outfit) took my order without noting it down. She had a 50-50 chance of getting my request of coffee over tea right .... And failed. The order of two fried eggs, two bacon, one sausage and black pudding came as three bacon, one sausage and black pudding! It was put right by the waitress who served me but was a minor wrinkle in an otherwise great stay. 

For what ever even of just a break away I would not hesitate to recommend Killashee Country Hotel.",5,2013,06,20
218,"Great Hotel, Fabulous Staff , lovely experience I will  be back !","I stayed in Kilashee House Hotel for one night (last Sunday)
we really had a lovely time , The staff were so helpful and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. 

The room was lovely , it was a bit chilly though, and when I enquired about it they supplied us with a portable heater until the heating came on . Thats service !

I was a little disapointed that Turners Restaraunt wasnt open on sunday night (sign of the times)
but our meal in Jacks Bar was excellent and we had the lovliest waitress who was so friendly. 

It is a pleasure to stay in Kilashee and I would recommend it . Top Marks !",5,2013,06,18
218,Great hotel in a beautiful setting,"Stayed at the hotel for one night during June bank holiday weekend. First impressions were very good as we approached the hotel up the well manicured grounds. Ample parking at the front of the hotel, very close to the entrance.
Check in was very quick and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. 
The rooms were very spacious with beautiful antique furniture. The decor of the rooms was in keeping with the period style of the original house. 
We availed of some treatments in the Vila spa which is located in a separate building at the rear of the hotel.
They offer a wide range of treatments and overall this was a very enjoyable & relaxing experience.
The restaurant was closed during our stay as it only opens on Friday and Saturday nights, however, we did have dinner in Jack's bistro which is basically the bar area. The menu choice was very good and they was a good bustling athmosphere.
The food was of a very high standard and service was good, again, the staff were very efficient and friendly.
The hotel is just 5 minutes drive to Naas town and about 15 minutes drive from Newbridge so very centrally located for shopping, site seeing and other activities within the county.
Would look forward to returning to the hotel for another stay in the future.",4,2013,06,18
218,Could not fault,"Stayed here for a wedding in 2012, could not fault the service or accommodation. Great attention to detail, great food.Liked it that much we have returned for barfood on a few occassions. Plan to return again for afternoon tea, which looks yummy!",4,2013,06,17
218,Excellent Value and Beautiful Setting,"I stayed here overnight and had a great time. The room was very large with 2 queen beds and spacious bathroom, with nice views and very quiet. The food was excellent, both evening meal and breakfast.
Definitely worth a visit.",5,2013,06,14
218,Pleasant experience,"Spent weekend at this hotel and finding it hard to find fault with anything.  Bedroom very well appointed, superb dinner in Turners restaurant, great gardens and overall probably the best staff I have ever encountered in a hotel.  Everyone excelled and showed such enthusiasm and care. Afternoon tea delicious along with great breakfasts in the very classy Turners dining room. Gardens are a joy and so many places to sit outside on a wonderfully sunny weekend.
No. 1 staff!",5,2013,06,09
218,"Nice staff, route to rooms a nightmare!","This is a return visit to the hotel for us. It's a nice hotel & the reception & bar staff appreciate their jobs. Lovely to see as I'm a stickler for friendly service. 
The price of the bar food is stiff enough and I'd say its of average standard. 
The design if the hotel means that you have to take lifts up, walk a corridor and take another lift up or down to your room. A bit of a pain, but that's the design of the hotel. 
Overall though, it's pretty nice. ",4,2013,06,07
218,Wedding,"Wonderful experience of this hotel which hosted the wedding reception of my cousin on 31/05/13. Nigel, the duty manager in charge of the reception was professional,considerate and easy to get along with. Sean, the porter on duty on 01/06/13 was helpful, professional and friendly in getting bags and bouquets sorted for home. The bed linen and double beds in the twin room felt luxurious. A wonderfully big dance floor for dancing and a cosy snug for the post dancing sing song. Attractive gardens for wedding photos. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the hotel.",5,2013,06,04
218,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful country!,"Stayed here one night while traveling in Ireland. It's an hour drive from the airport in Dublin (unless you take the scenic route through the Wicklow mountains). The hotel was lovely, the rooms were nicely appointed and the service great. I lost my bracelet at some point (the clasp broke) and the front desk had it the next morning. The on-site pub had good food, reasonably priced and comfortable. All-in-all we had a great visit and would stay there again!",5,2013,06,04
218,Brilliant top class,"Stayed in 304 on 01.06.13 paid 160 for b&b with wife & two kids and was worth every penny

No complaints whatsoever wished we could have stayed a week. Reception, waiting staff actually all staff we met very friendly, smiled and nothing was a problem. Lovely setting and gardens were an extra bonus

We will be back and keep up the good work",5,2013,06,02
218,Regular visitor but let down today,"I visited the bar today for some lunch.
We were seated at the door and there were a lot of flies bothering us however that may be our own fault as we were given the option to sit anywhere and we choose that seat
my partner and I were served by a pleasant young man called Alan, very nice and approachable. We ordered our starters, veg soup and goat cheese tartlet, 
I felt the soup was very overpowering with celery but my partner really enjoyed it and the bread was lovely with it. The tartlet was absolutely gorgeous I really enjoyed it full of cheese and the red pepper sauce was refreshing
We were waiting quite a long time for our mains so that was a bit irritating
when our mains arrived, lamb shank and sid pizza, the presentation was lovely very well put together.
my partner loved the pizza very fresh ingredients, no oil or grease in sight, I only got a nibble as he hoovered it up
My lamb shank was disappointing there was very little meat and the little there was wasn't falling away from the bone as a braised shank should. On a positive note the potato and veg accompanying the lamb were very nice
A lady server collected our plate and asked how our lunch was I stated it wasn't great and she ignored this and went on to give us our bill
we did not see Alan when leaving and we felt we were a bit dismissed by the lady server so we did not leave a tip. The next time we come I will be trying the afternoon tea ,this looked fab,  as I felt the price and food on the lunch menu was a bit off putting
",3,2013,06,02
218,Really nice and relaxing hotel,"We stayed here back in 2008 when attending a concert. So we didn't get a good chance to appreciate it. 

We were back again this time for a weekend of relaxation along with a visit to a family communion elsewhere in Kildare. 

I loved my weekend here. The hotel is so peaceful, even though there were 2 weddings on there that weekend! 
The bar was busy for food in the evenings but we were never waiting very long at all and the service was really good. The sleep quality here is excellent, we didn't wake both mornings until we naturally woke.. well after 9, having had peaceful sleep since 11 the nights before. The rooms are dark enough to keep out the light and you can't hear anything from the corridors or adjoining rooms. 
Breakfast.... I love spending time at breakfast in these hotels, when there isn't any pressure on you or any madness. The room was big enough to allow you peace at your own table and to take your time working through each bit. We read the newspapers and tipped away at cereal, fresh fruit, juices, tea/toast, and hot food ordered specifically (at no extra cost). Again the service was just excellent here. It was a real treat, like 5 star quality breakfasts you get. 
The hotel is really old style but doesn't feel at all out-dated. The bedroom was really large as was the bathroom. It had everything you would require. Although their DVD collection could do with updating. Only tiny drawback.. if you are staying in the adjoining building, the walk to the rooms takes quite a while. 

I would highly recommend Killashee House if you are staying in that part of the country. Only 20-30 mins from the M50 for access to Dublin also.",4,2013,05,29
218,Killahsee House Hotel,Travelled to the Killashee House Hotel for a wedding. It was lovely - particularly the setting. Service was good and I would love to come back for an overnight stay at some stage in the future. I thought the Snug Bar was intriguing and i loved the log fires burning in it.,4,2013,05,29
218,very enjoyable indeed - will be back !!,stayed here recently and had a very enjoyable experience.  The staff were were brillant and professional together with the food and wine been A1. I was surprised the leisure centre is located seperate from the hotel however the hotel makes up for any negatives. Great place cant wait to re visit !!!!!,5,2013,05,28
218,If you like quietness or you are in a large group this hotel is for you,This hotel caters mainly for groups eg weddings and funerals.  We were celebrating our anniversary and away without the children and expecting something special - we were so disappointed. On positive note the spa was great - staff were brilliant in it. Hotel too quiet for us!,2,2013,05,22
218,"Lovely surroundings, service friendly but a bit slow.","Jack's Bar has lovely decor and spacious surroundings. We have visited twice this week. Once for coffee and scones, once for lunch. Staff were friendly, but possibly short staffed as both times we were kept waiting to order and to pay the bill (in excess of 10 mins each time). Having said that the food was of a good standard and good value for money considering the hotel setting. ",3,2013,05,17
218,leinster entertainments awards,was at the awards ceremony at the killashee hotel on the 8/5/2013 would like to say that we had a great time and the room we got was just beautiful and the Staff were very helpful   well done. the hotel itself was spotless Clean. and the grounds were lovely.,5,2013,05,16
218,Relaxing stay at a lovely hotel,"We had a very relaxing and enjoyable weekend at the Killashee in early May. The staff at reception were very helpful and friendly, the room was comfortable (although it was quite a long walk to get to it - thanks, Sean for guiding us there!). We would have expected a flat screen TV in a hotel with a 4 star rating instead of the old dinosaur that was provided but this didn't detract from our weekend in any way as we only turned it on for the news in the morning. We were spoilt for choice for places to visit and had a fantastic day out at the Irish National Stud Farm and Japanese Gardens in Kildare. Thanks to the reception staff for their guidance and the 'two for the price of one' entry into the stud farm courtesy of the Killashee. The food at the hotel is first class and on the recommendation of other reviewers we felt we had to experience the afternoon tea. I'm so glad we did as it was superb and would put a lot of 5 star hotels to shame! All in all good value for money and would definitely recommend.",4,2013,05,12
218,Perfect wedding venue,"We got married here last month and couldn't have hoped for a more perfect day at Killashee. The hotel is gorgeous, the gardens were stunning for photos and the civil ceremony room was really beautiful. We stayed at Killashee for a friend's wedding a few years ago and it made such a good impression on us that when we got engaged there was no question of where we would get married.

The staff are what makes this hotel extra special, they couldn't do enough for us and our guests, the wedding co-ordinators Katie and Lisa made sure every little request and detail was taken care of which made for a very relaxed wedding day! One little story that describes how brilliant the staff are is when the guy we had booked to set up a photobooth for us didn't turn up, the duty manager Nigel rang him to sort it out. It seems he had forgotten about our wedding (very professional!) but would turn up 2 hours late! So one of the porters (the lovely Dylan) stepped in with the hotel camera, dressed up with lots of photobooth props and took pictures of our guests for 2 hours! He was so much fun and really made sure everyone was enjoying themselves. Above and beyond the duties of a porter!

We have some amazing memories of our wedding thanks to the brilliant staff and beautiful surroundings of Killashee and I can't thank them enough. Will definitely be back for many more visits!",5,2013,05,10
218,beutiful hotel,stayed here for 1 night as part of the celebration for 125 of dunlop tyres as a guest of dunlop ireland. the rooms were huge two massive double beds and very clean and a very large bathroom. the meal we had was excellent same with breakfast. overall had a great day and night and this hotel just added to it,5,2013,05,10
218,"Amazing, customer service at it's very best","Just home after a 2 night stay in this magnificent hotel. There were 16 on of us in total  and we were treated like royalty, even before we arrived the staff had ensured everything was in place as requested. 
We couldn't fault anything the customer service was exceptional, the food was fab both in the restaurant & ""Jack's"" our rooms were clean & very spacious. the bed was very comfortable. Time didn't allow for us to avail of any treatments in the spa, but next time we will avail for sure.
While the hotel is not the cheapest option in the area I can assure you will not find a hotel like it for customer service, the staff are top class and enjoy their jobs and it shows. A very special Thank you to Robert, Dylan, Lisa, Michelle, John  & Marion you make it a week-end we won't forget for a long time to come.  Thank you again",5,2013,05,06
218,Fabulous!!!!!,Stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting Punchestown festival. This has to be the best hotel we have ever stayed at. From reception to room service. From food to drink. Killashee House met our every need. The staff are the jewel in the crown of this magnificent hotel. Nothing was too much for any of them and the waiting staff in Jack's Bar were exceptional. There are far cheaper options in and around Naas but we doubt the welcome and service at Killashee House  could ever be beaten. We will never forget our experience at Killashee House. Thanks to everyone.,5,2013,04,27
218,"Beautiful hotel, with exceptionally friendly staff","Just returned from a one night stay at this hotel.  The hotel is set in beautiful grounds and you instantly feel relaxed from when you enter the door.  The is a real comfortable feel to the hotel and you feel quite looked after.  Our room was spotless and large.  The bed was very comfortable.  The whole feel to the room and bathroom was classic and comfortable. We ate in both the bar and the restaurant and the food was of a high standard in both, particularly the restaurant.  I also availed of some treatments in the spa which I would highly recommend.  The main aspect that stood out for me was the professionalism and friendliness of the staff.  Nothing was too much trouble and all the staff I came across were particularly warm, attentive and friendly.  Wish I could have stayed another few nights, really great hotel.",5,2013,04,21
218,Class hotel,"As a business person I have stayed in killashee on numerous occasions, and always recivied top class service and efficiency, this time however I was with my family , after check in with the ever efficient Louise we had lunch in Jacks where we had a relaxing lunch, I went for some treatment in the spa which were excellent  in the mean time my husband and kids went to the pool, my husband then went off roading in 4*4 jeeps in the hotel ground, we bumped in one of the managers called SImon that evening and to just to say he is a credit to the hotel he was so good with my 2 boys, 
Dinner that night was very good , we went to the cinema in naas , Simon recommend a movie which everyone enjoyed ,
On leaving we meet Simon who saw us on our way with a smile and wave
We definley  will be back",5,2013,04,21
218,Above average experience,"Stayed for a romantic getaway and had been told good things about the place. Nice setting and beautiful hotel

The pros:
Staff are attentive and friendly
Grounds are fabulous
Large hotel with lots of dining and drinking options
Free reliable wifi everywhere

The cons
Food wasn't as amazing as we were led to believe. The reason I'm counting it as a con is because I would expect high standard for a venue with this rating. The food is good. 
TV in bedroom is from the 80's! Could do with a makeover!
The room was in need of some tlc in parts. (Ripped wallpaper etc)

I'm probably being a tad harsh but when you pay top dollar you expect all the boxes ticked! However we would return and would recommend

Another point worth mentioning is that there were a couple of weddings on the weekend we were there. However at no stage did you feel as a regular guest that you were playing second fiddle to the wedding and the hotel deserve credit for that. The bars and restaurants were never too packed. ",4,2013,04,21
218,A beautiful setting,Beautiful hotel set in stunning grounds. was at a wedding here and everything was lovly. rooms big and spacious. My only critisism was the breakfast. I ordered waffles and they were overcooked. Apart from this it was a nice stay. It is expensive here but when you see the grounds you know why.,4,2013,04,21
218,Comfortable and Pleasant,"Just back from a conference at this hotel.  It is a splendid building, formerly a convent school, which has retained many of its original features.  The bedrooms are large, aprticularly the bed, and comfortable with a bath and seperate shower facility.  The food was very enjoyable and plentiful although drinks were slightly expensive.  The town is a couple of miles away and there is no pavement therefore a taxi would be required.  the grounds looked lovely for a wander but the weather prevented this during my stay unfortuantely.  There is a large spa and gym in the grounds with a very large swimming  pool facility.  The staff were particularly pleasant and helpful.  All in all, an excellent venue for a conference or wedding.",4,2013,04,18
218,Excellent,Stayed here as part of a wedding.The hotel is fabulous the staff are super and extremely professional the wedding was excellent and the food was fab.Our room was amazing it had a seperate bathroo real old wordly and it had a bell tower in it.Wish we could have stayed longer simply fabulous.Brakfast there was a great choice but the quality of the sausages etc could have been better was my only minor gripe.,5,2013,04,15
218,Afternoon Tea in this Hotel is Amazing,"We went to Afternoon Tea on a Sunday afternoon for our mother's birthday. Although Tea is only served between 3 and 6pm they accommodated us when we asked for 2pm.

€25 gave a 3 tier cake stand for 2 people. There were great sandwiches and cakes and the lemon meringue pie was especially lovely.

The staff were excellent. No request was a problem. The room is very well decorated and from the looks of it the restaurant's dinner and lunch menu looked nice.

The only issue we had was that the teapot & cups could have been nicer. Also there was no decaf tea on offer.",5,2013,04,10
218,Wedding and overnight stay,"This hotel is perfect. Myself and my wife got married here on January 18th. We had looked at plenty of venues, but this was the one that had the most character. Each room is meticulously designed and surrounded in warmth and history. Each one of our guests fell in love with the rooms (all in the old house). The modern part of the hotel has very large rooms, much bigger than most hotels I have stayed in!

The food is incredible. We have visited here many times before, and the food is always of the highest quality. I was here myself around 2 years ago and I loved the food then. Big portions and made with love! The staff are all very friendly. They have no problem dealing with any issue, and will always make sure you are happy. 

We are currently looking at staying here again sometime soon, because we love it so much. Comfortable, well fed, nice surroundings and a bit of culture. What else would you want?",5,2013,04,09
218,wonderful restful weekend,"Just returned from a wonderful restful weekend at the hotel. Even though there were weddings at the hotel we did not experience any noise in our room from the events. We had a deluxe room (227) at the back of the hotel overlooking the well equipped Gym,spa and swimming pool leisure centre.It had a large Queen bed which was very comfortable the room was large  with solid furniture and two armchairs, there were tea/ coffee making facilities provided and a ironing board and safe.The down side was the TV an old CRT type that had only stations of a analog picture quality on it, a newer flat screen TV with digital picture would make a big improvement to the room.
The bathroom was also large, well lit and with good ventilation and it had a bath on one side with a hand shower and on the other side a separate roomy shower cubicle a large mirror and table top with two wash basins made up the third side.Slippers and bath robes were provided although the bath towels were a little on the small side.Toiletries and a hair dryer are provided. On Saturday afternoon a chilled bottle of water and some miniature meringues were left up to the room. We had dinner both nights in ''Jacks'' restaurant and bar which is large and well staffed.It had a good range of food choices on the menu and prompt service.
Every member of staff we encountered were most pleasant and helpful and the hotel overall seemed to have a large compliment of well trained efficient staff. We stayed on a special offer 2 night break including breakfast which we had in Turners restaurant.The choice of food was excellent with buffet table of cold meats,cheese,fruit,cereals, yogurt and pastries. A full Irish breakfast was offered to order from your table as well. Overall .I would rate the hotel as one of the best value venues we have stayed at in Ireland.",5,2013,04,08
218,"Wonderful location, super facility","I have stayed a number o times both on business and professionally at the Killashee and would rate amongst the finest establishments in Ireland, fantastic rooms, excellent dining options and a very comfortable bar.",5,2013,04,08
218,Wonderful Hotel,My family and I stayed at this hotel last week for my daughter's wedding. The staff were very helpful and looked after us so well. The food was amazing. The rooms were lovely and comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel for weddings or any special occasion.,5,2013,04,08
218,Great Hotel!,"I really enjoyed the wedding we attended here last Friday. the staff at the function we trained to a high level and were very attentive to everything we needed. The Room was spacious and very comfortable! We'll be back. But there was only one fault i could find, after a good few drinks our room was extremely hard to find! Its a big hotel and the corridors are split and windy",5,2013,04,08
218,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here for one night in April.  Hotel is outside Naas - you need a car to get to the town from the hotel.  Lovely setting in gorgeous grounds.  Unfortunately it was very cold weather but there are lots of nice areas to sit outside in nice weather.  Reception is impressive as desk is near the double stairs leading upstairs.  Customer service very good.  Our room was lovely (we were upgraded to a junior suite), very clean, had a couch and table with chairs.  Large bed which was very comfortable.  Bathroom was spotless, shower was very good and it had a separate bath.  Had dinner in the bar that night - service was good in a very casual way.  Food was good with large portions.  Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice.
Parts of the hotel can be a little chilly but rooms, bar, restaurant were warm.  Had back massages in the spa which were great- relaxation area is lovely.  Spa is in a separate building so you cant wander to it in a bathrobe!  
Would stay here again and recommend to others",4,2013,04,08
218,Great Hotel,I recently got married here.All of the staff went above and beyond to assist us and our guests.One of the few hotels that employ and train pleasant staff to a high degree.I have experienced this on many occasions when eating in the restaurant & using spa & will continue to do this in the future.,4,2013,04,02
218,Low Protein Living Weekend - 1st - 3rd March 2013,"I would just like to say that this organised weekend that was for adults and children with PKU was very well organised.  The talks that they had arranged on Saturday morning were very interesting and I especially enjoyed the Cookery Session on the Sunday morning ie. making pastry for Jam Tarts and the Cake Pops using the machine.

The hotel staff were superbly helpful and on hand with everything in the Dining Room. I assume they were under some pressure although they looked very calm and carried out everything without any hiccups.

The room that my partner, Joe and I stayed in at the hotel was absolutely massive and the bathroom was huge - like a big wet room. The shower was gorgeous.  
The Leisure Centre was delightful with state of the art technology machines.  I would have liked to have used the Spa treatments as well, but unfortunately had not budgeted for this expense.

I would definitely like to stay here at this hotel again should there be any special offers for 2 night deals over a weekend in the Autumn as this is when we shall be going away again.

Thanks again for a wonderful weekend,

Regards,

Nicola Reynolds and Joe Whelan",5,2013,03,31
218,Excellent,"Really Good Hotel.
Attended a wedding in Kilashee house a couple of weeks ago, and had a really great time.
Kilashee house was an excellent venue for he wedding, lovely grounds - lovely building, the whole lot.
The hotel was really excellent, bit challenging finding our room initially, but when we found it the room was really lovely.  Really big, very comfortable and had all the essentials you would require.  The bathroom was huge again with all that was required, seperate bath and shower.
The wedding venue was really lovely, the pre recpetion nibbles, the dinner was amazing and the atmosphere was brilliant.
A number of us stayed the following night as we booked a 2 night B&B with 1 dinner.
The breakfast was perfect, and the food that evening was amazing.
The staff were brilliant and could not do enough for you, very friendly and always in good humour.  Didn't make it to the SPA but based on my expriance in the hotel I would magine it is top class.

If your visiting Naas or even have to pass through, you should call tothis hotel - even if it is only for afternoon tea.

Enjoy !",5,2013,03,29
218,some improvements needed,"I recently attended a wedding in this hotel and found it to be just wonderful. The staff were very helpful in all respects and although my time spent here was very enjoyable I felt it necessary to reflect on some improvements I feel would have enhanced our stay. Firstly I have been to numerous weddings in recent years here but never have I noticed such a scarcity in the fresh flowers they usually pride themselves on. Maybe it was the bride and groom that have supplied these in the past but the minimal arrangment at the entrance I'm sure is not their responsibility and was quite a disappointing entrance to such a beautiful place. Maybe my familiarity with the establishment has made me more aware of these details but in my opinion the difference in flower displays is significant and needs to be addressed to uphold standards. Secondly our room although it is supposed to be traditional ins style had a VERY dated block t.v. which was not an issue but for the money paid I'd probably expect high end electrics.  My final issue was with the bathrooms-the wedding was in the large ballroom and although I noticed they have made plenty new refurbishments to this end of the hotel, the toilets were horrendous!! The wall paper was ripped off some of the walls and they just seemed very grotty and old-not appropriate for again the beautiful premise this is.",4,2013,03,24
218,Superbly attentive staff,Spent three days at this hotel recently. All the staff were extremely attentive and helpful. The room was spacious and very clean though a little cool at times.The bar and restaurant food was delightful. The Spa was a real treat despite the fact that you have to go outside to access the swimming pool and spa. The hotel is very large and somewhat spread out but this could not detract from the warm welcome and friendly staff.,4,2013,03,24
218,Worth a trip for Jacks Bar & Bistro,"We detoured off the motorway following a recommendation, the setting is beautiful and impressive. Inside the decor of the bar is very modern and different from what you'd expect. 

We both had starters and main courses, prices are in line with what you'd pay at any of the pubs close by, presentation of food was very good, portion size good and taste was excellent. 

Service was a little lower than expected for the setting, younger staff that may need to gain a little more customer service training on attentiveness and upsell skills. 

However I'd recommend it and will pop back in again. ",4,2013,03,16
218,enjoyable bistro food,"I had the pleasure of Dinning in the Bistro at Killashee House Hotel this week. I found the choice of Food available on the set Menu very Acceptable while the Al A Carte was excellent. The service could be improved, While the area was very busy, I made an allowance for the lack of expertise. I thoroughly enjoyed there Warm Cajun Caesar Salad starter followed by a nice fish dish of Cod with Chorizo mash, followed by an aero mint cheesecake. I felt it was expensive for what you got but did not mind paying as I enjoyed the food.",3,2013,03,15
218,turners restaurant,"i have recently been to the killashee house hotel with my partner,he has been telling me about it for ages so we decided to book a meal,when driving in to the place all i could think was wow,the exterior of the place was amazing,we went in to jacks bar for a drink first,very swanky looking bar,after a drink or two we went in to turners where we had our meal booked,the restaurant has a real old fashioned look to it compared to jacks bar-bistro,the staff were friendly and we were brought our menus once we were comfortable, a young waitress took our orders,she didn't seem like she was quite suited for fine dining,maybe more for the lines of a bistro,i noticed this with a lot of the staff as the night went on,when the starters came out the food looked amazing and tasted as good as they looked,i was suprised by the real modern presentation as the restaurant has a total different look,very impressive,the mains came out shortly after the table was cleared,again food looked great and tasted great,i tasted my partners beef and it was also Delicious,at this stage the restaurant was very busy and all the staff were running around,we were not getting much attention like i we have had in other fine dining establishments,the deserts followed and and then the little petit fours which was all so good,we were both very  happy with the whole meal, couldn't fault it,we moved back to jacks bar shortly after to finish the night with some drinks and music which was a great finish to the night,over all the place was great,the food was great but the service needs a bit more work to give you the true fine dining experience,we will be most definitely be returning in the near future",5,2013,03,11
218,Relaxed Enjoyable Weekend,"I just spent 2 nights in the Fabulous Kilashee House Hotel. Spent Friday and Saturday night there. We were checking in just as a wedding was coming in and it was very hard to hear what the lady was saying as there was bagpipes playing in the background, but later on reception rang up to the room and apologised for the noise and told us to pop back down when we got a chance. The room was lovely and spacious as i had been upgraded to the Junior Suite. We were offered a turndown service at about 7 o clock which i thought is a lovely offer. Not many hotels do that as well a little bag of sweets. Its all a bout the little things. We had dinner in Jacks Bar and Bistro that night, and again not a complaint to be had. Very nice atmosphere and staff very attentive but not in your face too much. Very decent sized portions. We went back doen to the bar later on for a few drinks, where there was a 1 man band playing. He had to be my only complaint through the whole weekend. For a 4 star hotel, he hasnt a note in his head. I was glad when he stopped. Breakfast the next morning was very nice, was impressed it was fresh tea and coffee that was given out to each table, and  the tot breakfast we ordered was hot and fresh and came from the kitchen not out on stand where the cold buffett was. We took a walk around the magnificaent gardens, which im sure are even more prettier during the summer. And the place looks lovely lit up at night. Again there was a wedding on on the Sunday. The whole weekend was very enjoyable and your staff are a pleasure.",4,2013,03,11
218,amazing family gathering,we're just back from a family gathering of 10 people celebrating 2 birthdays. we really had an amazing team. we were really specific in our requirements and Dee front of house and Philip in the kitchen certainly delivered. We started with a lovely lunch (while others were having posh afternoon tea) and watching the match in jacks before heading off for a swim. Later our evening began with a prosecco and canapé reception in the conservatory before continuing the evening with an amazing dinner in Turners restaurant. The restaurant setting is olde world but the food is bang up to date with really amazing food including stunning hereford beef. Breakfast was top notch with plated breakfast served individually. You need to get down early on a sunday morning as everyone usually tries to eat at the same time. I'm fairly picky but our group was royaly looked after and I'd have no hesitation in recommending Killashee as a great get away - roll on the Gathering for 2013!,5,2013,03,10
218,A lovely afternoon tea treat,"My daughter took me to Killashee House Hotel for afternoon tea.  Its seldom these days that we can say we got 'value for money' but this is the exception.  We had a beautiful visit - a huge cup of cappucino and a big pot of tea between us together with 2 huge scones accompanied by cream and a pot of jam, 4 open sandwiches which were on speciality breads and delicious.  We also polished off our visit with a selection of little cakes which again were heaven.  As for the value for money part the price is €25 for two people. Staff were very friendly and attentive.  There are lovely grounds around the hotel and one can find peace and quiet if this is desired.  The hotel was busy - a good sign in these economic times.",5,2013,03,04
218,bog standard lunch,"My husband and I love to pop into the Killashee for coffee and cake, as we live locally.  I must say that it us always a wonderful experience.  Their cakes are A1 - they cannot be beaten.  The staff are very well trained and very helpful.

However,  three times in the past few months I had lunch in Jack's Bar and Bistro; once with a friend and twice with my husband.  We were so disappointed with the food, to say that it was bog standard was an understatement.  I would rate the standard of the three lunches equally.  They were like something dished up in an army canteen.  On one occasion we had the beef, mash and two veg. and it seemed to have been all dried out.  The gravy was soaked up by the food, we could see the dried out traces of the gravy, but no liquid.

This happened over the course of six weeks, so I am assuming that nobody is checking the food as it goes out of the kitchen.

I will have afternoon tea there again, but will never order meals.",3,2013,02,25
218,Lunch,We had lunch here last Tuesday and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the hotel. My parents and myself were visiting my brother who lives locally and decided to come here for lunch. I had never been here before so I did not know what to expect. From the moment we came in we found the staff to be extremely friendly and professional - especially Paul who is a credit to the hotel. My brother has walking difficulties but he found access to the hotel and public areas to be excellent. The food was fabulous - very well made and extremely fresh. Being a hotel manager myself for nearly 20 years I found the service here to be unbeatable. We will definitely be back!,5,2013,02,21
218,Fabulous Hotel !!,"Just returned from a one night stay in this amazing hotel.  From the minute we arrived, and were checked in by Laura who was very friendly, extremely efficient, informative and helpful to our departure we had one of our best hotel experiences ever (& we have travelled extensively!).  We booked a family room for 5 and were very pleasantly surprised by the size, comfort and layout of the room which was immaculate. The hotel itself is very grand and has the 'wow' factor with large foyers and piano bars.  We had dinner in Jacks bar - definitely worth booking a table in advance - the food was absolutely delicious and offers a superb choice for both adults and children.  The night we stayed there was a ball taking place with hundreds of people attending but we didn't hear any noise in our room and all had a great nights sleep!  We also visited the spa - which is separate to the hotel and a short walk across the car park.  This was not an issue as its only a minute walk outside and well worth the visit as the facilities are first class with 25m pool, a huge state of the art fitness suite, hairdressers and spa treatments.  Breakfast was very relaxing with a comprehensive choice of cooked and continental or both !  Staff were courteous and friendly. As a family with three children we could find no fault or any area for improvement.  Its a real gem and we will definitely be back !!",5,2013,02,17
218,Return stay - very disappointed !!,"Returned to Killashee after having a fab stay previously - stayed1 night Saturday the 9th February - prior to booking asked for an upgrade as I was a returning guest said I'd chance my arm - was advised on check in that this wasn't possible - was disappointed as my last stay we recieved an automatic upgrade - but figured as I'd booked a ""deluxe "" room in a 4 star country house the room would be luxury !! Receptionist was lovely said she'd "" do something "" for me as she couldn't upgrade me but assured me room 317 was ""lovely and quite part of the hotel"" - we were very underwhelmed when we entered the room - a drab dull bog standard room you'd find in any city centre 3 star - a million miles from the room I'd stayed in previously - we decided to just get on with it & put our disappointment to one side - we had dinner in Jacks bar which was adequate service was slow enough though / food was ok nothing fantastic if I'm honest - but not unpleasant - we got to bed at midnight and could hear the thumps of music coming from the wedding reception being held in the hotel - we finally got to sleep and were awoken several times during the night by other guests screaming and singing in the hall - I reported this to the receptionist on check out whose gesture was 2 drinks (value €12) taken off the bill - an insult - I won't be back ",3,2013,02,11
218,Great place for a relaxing weekend,What a fabulous place. The service is flawless and the bedroom and communal areas were spotlessly clean. The drinks are expensive (€7 for a 3/4 bottle of wine) but that is my only negative comment! Would definitely recommend it.,5,2013,02,10
218,Afternoon Tea,"Have had afternoon tea in the bar area twice now. Service is always excellent and afternoon tea enjoyable. It was a busy Saturday afternoon with at least one wedding on. We took a stroll around the gardens before going in for afternoon tea. We had booked and were seated promptly. The table was laid out and our order was taken- €25 for two people. The table was a little small and we felt a tad squished when everything arrived. Sandwiches were yummy. Scones were nice too with clotted cream and jam. The tea was too strong but I got a 2nd pot of water to weaken it down. The slices of cake were cut a lot thinner than the time before. But this was not the case for the couple sitting behind us. The cakes were tasty and well presented but I felt they had been sitting on the plate in the fridge for a while as the passion fruit cheesecake had run under the other desserts (softening the pastry shell on the fruit tartlet). 

Overall a lovely treat (with plenty of calories) but would return for the good service and value of the afternoon tea. ",5,2013,02,05
218,drink prices,"Recently attended a wedding at Killashee, excellent service from all the staff,food was 100% and the hotel was spotless,  really enjoyed the day apart from the drink prices that were just crazy,
Ie. Large bottle of cider 6.30 ,this I feel and I know from talking to alot of others at the wedding that were buying drink that they also felt that there was no need for these high prices.
People are not willing to pay these prices and this was very clear to see at this wedding as the bar could have easy have being maned by one person.
Such a pity that greedy prices is what everyone spoke about the next day.
please note I did not stay overnight but from talking to others it was lovely",3,2013,02,04
218,Stay  here  this  is  the  best,"Myself  and my  wife  stayed  here  for  2  nights on  a  2  nights  B/B  and  1  evening  dinner  plus  a  third  night  free  complentary  this  offer  was  for  Jan/Feb
This  Hotel  could  not  be  faulted, the  room  was  terrific  a  superior  room,  Food  in  the  bar  was  excellent  as  was  the  food  in  the  a la carte  restaurant. Brekfast  was  also  excellent  with  great  choices
But  the  best  thing  about  this  hotel  is  the  Staff,  they  are  vey  helpful  and  friendly  nothing  was  a  problem  we  only  had  a  few  niggles  they  were  sorted  out  straight  away.We  used  the  Spa  facilities  it  has  a  full  gym , beauty  parlour,  hairdresser  lesiure cente
I  have  stayed  in  Hotels  all  over  the  world, the  staff  in  this  hotel  would  rate  the  highest  for  customer  service  and  friendlyness
This  is  a  big  hotel  it  was  once  a  large  convent  school,  if  you  are  visitor  from  outside  of  ireland   you  could  probaly  stay  in  hotels  much  nearer to  Dublin  this  is  about  45 mins  from  Dublin,Trust  me  none  of   the  hotels in  Dublin  come  near  to  this,Ideal  for  a  quite  getaway  for  a  few  days, with  the  local  town  of  Nass  only  5  mins  drive  with  plenty  of  pubs  and  restaurants
If  you  are  booking  this  hotel  do  so  by  phone  you  will  get  a  bigger  bang  for  your  buck
This  is  a  hidden  gem",5,2013,02,04
218,Afternoon tea,"On a wet and wild January Tuesday ,decided a treat was in order.Afternoon tea in Killashee is a treat to behold.Fresh sandwiches,cakes,pastries,macaroons,scones and jam.Service very good as usual.You leave the place feeling refreshed",5,2013,02,02
218,lovely!!!,"just home from a 1 night stay at killashee, got a deal 1 night b&B + 4 course eve meal for €89 pps. excellent value. meal was lovely, room was lovely. if i was to have any complaints they would be small ones - we stayed in room 137 in belling wing, if you dont like walking u'l not be happy, and just to say bed was so comfy but the pillows were like concrete blocks. overall beautiful hotel, lovely food and check out The Snug Bar - cosy traditional irish bar, cud hv stayed there all nite at the fire. v happy with our stay, hope to be back soon",4,2013,01,27
218,As close to 5 star you can get.,"This is as near a perfect hotel you can get. On approach the entrance is breathtaking. The grounds are beautiful with glorious gardens, on entry there is a warm log fire, with friendly staff, who quickly organise everything for your stay. Our room was spacious and more than comfortable, with two double beds and spacious bathroom. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast and could not complain about any single aspect. This is an ideal hotel for a stay in the eastern/midlands side of Ireland and is surprising that it doesn't have a greater profile. The only reason we can think of, are the subsidies given by NAMA to hotels which do not offer the personnel touch given by the likes of killashee. We note some comments regarding the unique layout of the hotel, but this adds to its enjoyment. Yes you can pick the minor defect here and there, but you will not experience a more comfortable stay in a family run hotel in Ireland. It's a gem. Go there . You won't be disappointed, unless you want a false image of what a real irish hotel is all about. ",4,2013,01,25
218,Great Experience,"Just back from Wedding at this hotel for 200 people.  it was class!.  fantastic food for the meal in the Thomson Suite. room in Belling Suite was very nice as was shower/toilet area, big and had everything you need.  Stayed 2nd night - enjoyed a special 're-enigiser' package at the Spa next day which was wonderful.  B'fast each morning was wonderful, anything you wanted/needed was given just for the asking.
grounds are lovely and we had little walk around.  the corridors go on for ever and it's a bit confusing going from 1 lift to another but it works.!
staff were wonderful and could not do enuf for everyone.  Enjoyed this weekend away and would recommend this hotel for wedding, romantic stay or even for girls w/end away.  Jack's food on Sunday night was lovely too, but bar very quiet on Sun night, only few couples there, imagine it's jammers in Summer?   Well done Killashee on great performance.",5,2013,01,23
218,Great weekend,"We stayed here for a family 60th Birthday weekend, all of our party had a wonderful experience.  We dined in the restaurant on the Saturday and the food was excellent. The hotel was beautiful. I was a litrle dissapointed that I had to cross the car park to access the swimming pool but I would return to Killashee again,",4,2013,01,21
218,Very nice country hotel,"I stayed at the Killashee for a family wedding last year.  Our family room for 2 adults and 2 kids (under 10) was €300 for 2 nights B&B, which I thought was pretty good.  The facilities in the hotel were excellent, with a decent bar area as well as the leisure suite.  The layout of the rooms was very confusing - to get to our 2nd floor room we had to take an elevator to the third floor, walk along a corridor and then take another elevator down to the second.  Every corridor had a lost resident wandering along it, not even sure what floor they were on.  

The food served at the wedding banquet was surprisingly good for a mass-catering type of thing, but it's a pity the breakfasts weren't as good.  On the first morning I had the blandest fry-up I have ever tasted, and the second morning I tried an omelette, which was a big round thing ths shape of a pancake and not like any other omelette I have ever seen or tasted, and not in a good way!  Still, breakfasts aside it was a very enjoyable stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if I was in the area.",4,2013,01,18
218,A truly magical experience,"I stayed at this hotel on 20th December for the Christmas Party. As soon as I arrived at the gates my spirits lifted. It was dark and all the trees were filled with fairy lights. The decor of the hotel is vey atmospheric, the corridors went on forever and the paintings on the wall were whimsical and amusing. My room was very grand and took my breath away. The staff were charming. A lovely breakfast with gluten free toast was cooked for me the next morning. Only issue was the band was a bit loud and not romantic enough. Same went for the dj music. Felt that for such a fabulous hotel the Christmas party could have been better. ",5,2013,01,15
218,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Staff","We stayed there on 30th and 31st December 2012, this being the third year in a row we have stayed for New year and for good reason, this hotel is exceptional value staffed by extremely helpful,friendly and professional staff. We stayed in the Belling Wing we had 3 rooms and had a beautiful rooms with everything you would expect and more, they were extremely comfortable,no complaints.We booked a 2 night stay with 2 dinners bed and breakfast, one meal was in Jacks which is informal and it has a wide and varied menu , there were 4 of us each having different items from the menu and none of us were left disappointed the food and service was excellent.The New Years Eve meal we had in Turners, which is more formal and the 6 course meal with a complimentary glass of bubbly and a harpist playing in the background was superb and unbelievable value, highly recommended. The log fire with the big comfortable seating around is an ideal place to sit and people watch with a coffee or hot whiskey and my 82 year old mother was quite content to sit there and do exactly that. All the seating around the hotel is extremely comfortable and there are lots of quiet little corners where you can sit and read the paper, a book or simply have a quiet moment to yourself. However if you wish there was music in Jacks on both nights we were there and you can dance the night away. Breakfast is a cold buffet and unlike in other hotels where the microwave is king and your hot breakfast order is served almost immediately this hotel cooks all it's breakfasts to order so be prepared to wait a little while. I would suggest that you do not leave it till the last minute to go for breakfast ,it finishes at 11am as it tends to get quite busy with people usually from the weddings coming down at about ten to the hour, however even if you do arrive at that time you will find the staff smiling and only too willing to serve, I saw what they had to do on New Years Day and they coped brilliantly with way too many people turning up late , it was that busy the doors that normally shut at 11 sharp were still open at 11.15, I must highly commend the staff and whoever trains them, as they were pushed above and beyond what should have been expected of them and as I said earlier coped brilliantly. There were 2 weddings on each day we stayed and because of the size of the hotel the ordinary guests like myself were not inconvenienced in any way,I also noted on the day we were checking out 3 couples being shown around for future weddings and I can understand why couples would want to have their wedding there the hotel is class.I will finish by saying my mother asked as we were checking out if we would bring her back next New Years Eve and we promised her we would ,in fact we have already booked.",5,2013,01,14
218,"Gorgeous hotel, amazing staff","We got married here and stayed for several nights both for the tasting weekend and the weekend of the wedding. The rooms are all different, big, with gorgeous decor. The social areas in the hotel are well designed, big comfortable seating and lots of space. The staff are fantastic, friendly and really helpful. I'd highly recommend it for a short stay and wedding.",5,2013,01,12
218,Freezing Cold Room,"We stayed here for a wedding on New Year's Eve 2012. On arrival, we were allocated room 145 in the Belling Wing. Having eventually navigated the maze of hallways and lifts we located our room at the end of a very cold corridor - this should have been a major warning sign as other parts of the hotel were warm and the radiators in this area were all cold. The bedroom was cold on entering but we didn't explore to much as we were keen to get back to the wedding party. On returning to the room later that evening, it was like a fridge and there was no heating on. A small dimplex plug in heater was left in the corner of the room so this seemed to be the only source of heat for the room. The hotel must have been aware that there was no other heating available in the room. Having paid for a deluxe double room - this was not good enough. My husband made 3 calls to reception about the lack of heating in the room and in the corridor area. He was repeatedly told it would be resolved in 10 minutes. Clearly, they hoped that we would just go to bed. After 30 minutes, we packed up our stuff and left the room and headed to reception. As we stepped out of the lift, there was a staff member coming to meet us. We were subsequently allocated room 327 which did in fact have heating that was on and working.

On checking out the next day, I made reception aware of the issues with the room on the previous evening. They indicated that it must have been an isolated issue as they had no other complaints. However, we spoke to a number of other guests in our group who also had very cold rooms so it doesn't appear to be an isolated incident.

They did reduce the cost of our room, however this did not make up for the disappointment and bad experience. We were really looking forward to our night at Killashee but unfortunately it did not live up to our expectations. the reception staff also indicated that a Manager would contact me regarding the issues that we experienced but nobody contacted us since our stay.

The Breakfast Room was chaotic on New Year's Day - the staff did not seem to be able to cope with the number of guests and the service was very slow. We waited that long for our cooked breakfast that we thought the order had been lost.

I don't think this hotel is worth the money and I would not recommend to friends or family.",2,2013,01,07
218,Lovely birthday break,"Just returned from a 2 night stay and have no complaints! 

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful as were all throughout. 

As it was a birthday break, I really appreciated the little touches such as the complimentary upgrade to a suite and the assortment of macaroons delivered to the room. The turn down service was also a lovely touch.

Food in Jack's was lovely and presented beautifully. Breakfast in Turner's was ample and tasty.

Spa was a lovely way was to spend a Sunday afternoon. 

The gardens and history of this hotel make it a wonderful place to stay; will definitely recommend and be returning.",5,2013,01,07
218,Excellent Staff,"I recently stayed 2 nights at Killashee house for a family wedding and I have nothing but good remarks to say about the venue.

Whilst the reception and floor staff always seem very busy, there willingness to help at any time was a credit to the hotel.  

Check in was quick and double deluxe rooms were very spacious with free Wi-fi available.

We had a meal in the Bar the night before the wedding and it was very nice and contrary to other reviews even though the bar was extremely bust we were not waiting too long for our food.  The food was of good quality and my wife and my two boys (6 & 4) were happy.  

The leisure centre is indeed a very short walk across the car park but the staff were very friendly and my boys and I had good fun in the swimming pool.  I did find the water and the general area including changing rooms a wee bit cold but perhaps thankful of this after a hot shower.

The wedding venue itself was excellent and I must stress again the excellent staff that really could not do enough for us and all the kids present.

The location of the hotel is about a 5 min drive from centre of Naas and is easy to find.

All in all a classy hotel with excellent staff.",5,2013,01,04
218,Nice hotel shame about the service,"We stayed here as a family with our young son for New Years. We should have known when we checked in what to expect of our stay. The ladies on reception are very pleasant and helpful but they constantly seemed to be rushed off their feet. The hotel was fully booked on the evening we checked in so we were advised that if we wanted to eat in the bar that we should make a reservation. When we did venture into the bar we stood patiently to be served by one of the four staff behind the bar. Though they seemed busy they prioritised orders coming from the waiting staff and after a time if being ignored we eventually had to ask if someone could take our order. I took our son to the leisure centre but didn't realise that while we were following signs for the leisure centre inside the hotel we would eventually end up in the car park and would have to walk across this to get to our destination. The staff in the leisure centre (which is very well equipped) were very friendly and polite and are a credit to the centre.
Breakfast on our first morning was nice and relaxing with a very good selection of dishes to choose from. Our second morning however was a total disaster. We showed up for breakfast at 10:45 and were third in line. The dining room was full (there had been 2 weddings held the day before). To say that the staff were running around like headless chickens is an understatement. The hostess was walking around to see what spaces she had available and a huge queue formed behind us stretching out to the lobby. Wait staff were taken from the floor and asked to carry chairs up from one of the dining rooms downstairs. People behind us in the queue were seated before us even though we were a party of 3. We were finally seated after almost 15 minutes. I would have thought that they would be prepared for such occurances, especially since the dining room was empty at 9am when my sister had her breakfast? Our order for breakfast was promptly taken and we sat and waited, and waited, and waited until after 25 minutes of watching people who came in after us get their breakfasts I eventually enquired as to where our food was. I was told that a large number of dockets had gone into the kitchen at the same time and that it would be out shortly. We finally got our meal which in itself was a bit of a let down. While all the plates were extremely hot, my 4 year olds plate was also too hot to touch and he burned his fingers (who would serve a child a plate that hot?). My poached egg was raw on the inside, the white of the egg was still clear near the yolk and I couldn't eat it. All in all this hotel seems to have over stretched itself. The staff are unable to cater for the guests when the hotel is at or almost at capacity. Some of the staff seemed snooty and we felt uncomfortable a few times as if they felt we shouldn't have been there. I have been to lesser starred hotels and had more enjoyable times. I certainly wouldn't be recommending this hotel to anyone. ",2,2013,01,01
218,Wonderful staff!,I recently spent 2 nights at Killashee for a wedding.  All of the staff I met were wonderful.  They were efficient yet friendly.  Our room was in the old part of the hotel.  The room was a good size and clean.  The food was fabulous.  The smoking area off the bar is very comfortable with a fire which helped keep away the chills.  We used the hairdressers and again found the staff to be excellent.   The only fault with it being that the Spa is a little distance from the main hotel .....rain and freshly styled hair are not a good mix.  We did ask at the reception desk if they had an umbrella that we could borrow but they didn't.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Killashee house and would recommend it without hesitation.   So lovely to meet such nice staff.,4,2012,12,27
218,Poor food service,"Been to the bar here many times and always found it good.but what a disaster on the 23rd December 2012.This was faulty towers at its best. Drinks were served quickly and we asked for a food menu.. Our order was taken by a very pleasant young lady, and we asked to move to a table.to have our meal. When we moved to the table suggested there was one standard chair and a very low chair.We asked for one of the chairs to be changed, they said they would try and get a replacement which they did. We had already ordered and when the food arrived the table had not been setup.. The server spotted we had no cutlery after a few minutes and setup the table. Needless to say at this stage the food was just warm.. Exactly the same thing happened when dessert was served no cutlery.
This was a shambles and while the bar was busy an most tables occupied there was a serious lack of management on duty. The only excuse offered was that they were closing for the Christmas period and staff were helping to clean up. The staff were at all times pleasant and courteous but the lack of basic service and training was quite extraordinary for a four star establishment.
The hotel is well situated and in a lovely setting but why no managers available to deal with a customer.",1,2012,12,24
218,Not a 4 star experience.,"My partner and I stayed here on a midweek special recently. We were upgraded to a junior suite, as the hotel was almost empty, apart from the very popular Zumba classes, and people using the health centre across the way from the hotel. I sometimes think that hotels have rooms set aside, to give people, when they are giving free upgrades. These rooms are below standard from the usual quality, but sure, they will do for these clients who wont know any better. 
My partner and I are very well travelled, and have stayed in some of the most prestigious hotels in Ireland, and are working our way through the Blue Book. This hotel is dark, dingy and musty smelling, at best. The junior suite is one room, divided by a smelly old couch, has furniture in the room, possibly since it was originally built for the landed gentry, who once owned the place. The tv was so old, I wondered did it still work since the digital switch over. There was no minibar, fridge, or any other luxury items found in better hotels, lucky to have tea and coffee making facilities, and even these were not to be had in any great abundance. You were each allowed one coffee or tea per stay, and even the sugar was rationed. My partner was quite wary all night about the place, and because it reminded her of a haunted house, or something similar. The corridor we walked down, to get to our room, was freezing cold and creaky underfoot, we thought it was leading us to a newer wing of the hotel, but the room told a different story. Trying to watch the tv in bed is a no no. You cannot turn up the volume enough to hear it, and if you are lying down, with your head propped up on the pillows, you cant see it because the back of the couch obscures your view. 
We ventured down to the bar for our food, as the restaurant was closed, being midweek. We were in for a surprise. The food here was fabulous. To start with, we both had the taster platter, which I would heartily recommend, cant remember what we had for mains or dessert, but it went down extremely well. 
The beautifully manicured gardens are ajoy to walk around, and they have Emmas butterfly garden, in aid of Debra Ireland. I really enjoyed my stroll around the gardens, before my very tasty and properly cooked breakfast. The view over towards the mountains was beautifil, with the snow on them.",3,2012,12,11
218,short stay,"my husband and I stayed here midweek while attending a seminar. food was very good and service excellent. rooms large and comfortable but lighting in bedroom very dull. did not visit spa. room where seminar was held was spacious and comfortable. we were very well taken care off . this is a very large hotel , bedrooms quite a distance from reception and layout a little confusing . very quiet location and easily accessed from Dublin. ",3,2012,12,09
218,"A Converted convent , hidden gem on outskirts of Naas","Stayed for 3 nights as part of wedding. Great facilities for all the family. Rooms were spacious and very clean. Staff could not have been more helpful. Grounds are well maintained. Not location you can walk to from Naas , definitely taxi or car. Great food and bars ",5,2012,11,30
218,Expected more for 4 star,"My husband, 2 boys and I stayed here for 2 nights last month. First impressions were great, house looks very impressive, reception area is quite grand. But finding our room was tricky, esp with 2 small kids and lots of bags. The accommodation wings are very poorly connected, we had to take lifts up to the top floor in one, walk along a few corridors, then take a lift down to the bottom of another wing, and then another long walk to our room... There were emergency double doors open along these corridors every time we passed leaving them freezing!
The room was nice (definitely not 4 star), dated but warm, spacious, and comfy. Bathroom was more modern thankfully. 
Breakfast was lovely.
But dinner the first night was a struggle, food was good but service was very bad! I lost count of the amount of times we had to get up and ask for every little thing ourselves. It really ruined the meal. Following night was a bit better, but we picked the table right beside the managers/waitstaff station and maybe that helped.....?
Pool was fine, reminded me of a public community pool from the 80's, changing area very very cold, and again leisure centre not connected to the hotel so we had to brave the freezing cold and sleet and rain to get to it. There wasn't any staff member on duty in the pool area (perhaps they were keeping an eye on a camera from the comfort of a desk somewhere?).
Best part of the hotel was the Priests House bar.
I wouldn't come back here to be honest, there seems to be an air of panic about the way it's run....it's a bit all over the place.",3,2012,11,28
218,Great Hotel,"I stayed with a colleague in the Killashee  in November 2012. The hotel is very impressive on arrival with its grand buildings and grounds. Flocks of birds were forming overhead and they were quite loud which make the atmosphere very eery but it is atmospheric. The hotel is lovely and warm on entry and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were standard but may as well have been suites as we had plenty of seating in the room with a work station and lovely large bathroom. The bar is a little uninspiring as I think more could be done with the floor space to make it more inviting for guests. This is something to consider with an architect as it looks like it didnt have much of a design influence. How and ever it is functional, airy and the staff were very good. The food is a bit uninspiring as well. I had ravioli and my coleague the bacon and cabbage which was a bit garlic infused. The ravioli was nice but the sauce a bit confused as it was a tomatoe and cream mixture. I did finish it. The breakfast was much much better. I had a delicious omlette and coffee. Different chefs I would think. Really good breakfast selection and the staff again very friendly and courteous. I definitely will be staying the the Kilashee again. I will be trying different dinner options and I would recommend the hotel to all groups as it is a beautiful location and an interesting building. There is also the benefit of a very well equipped gym and leisure centre. Well done to all in the Hotel!",5,2012,11,27
218,Amazing venue,was at a wedding (one of two on the day). massive venue with no overlap. Staff were attentive rooms were reserved early. room met all our requirements. food excellent and dancing was in a location aposite to the dining room and didn't intrude. Excellent location for a wedding,5,2012,11,25
218,Very impressed with everything,"For my wife's birthday, I brought her to Newbridge silverware for a look around. I was looking for somewhere in Kildare in which to stay the night, and a friend recommended this place. I had no idea or expectation. Accommodation and a meal was pricey, but not exceptionally so for a four star hotel. When we arrived, I have to say that my expectations were very much exceeded. This hotel is absolutely enormous. Our bedroom was in the Belling section, and was huge. The furnishings were antique and cosy. We had a four poster bed. We both slept like logs. The bathroom was nice too, with twin sinks, jacuzzi bath and nice shower.We found it spectacular. One thing I liked too was that it was not stiflingly warm in the hotel or bedrooms. I find that a problem staying in hotels normally. Can be very hard to sleep indeed.The restaurant was exceptional. We both had potato and coconut soup for starters. Delicious. Then both had hereford beef. Absolutely beautiful. The dessert was out of this world. It was a chocolate fudge cake with black cherries, cherry sauce and ice cream. There was a chocolate swirl with honeycomb sticking out of the ice cream. The chef really knows his stuff. Lovely artistic flair and delicious taste. The service in the restaurant was exceptional. They have a lot of staff on. There seems to be a person for everything. That's good. We thought the breakfast service was excellent too. The full Irish breakfast was lovely, especially the sausages. My wife had waffles with syrup, which was lovely too. We found the reception staff to be very friendly on our departure. They were a bit under pressure on our arrival ! We will definitely stay here again.",5,2012,11,18
218,Wonderful venue,I was at a wedding in this hotel recently and it was a really was an amazing venue. The food was really excellent considering there was another wedding on at the same time. I was in a single room and I must say I was very spoilt with the huge sized room and shower-en-suite. Everything was spotlessly clean but the only thing I was disappointed with was there was no water in the room. The Spa looked great and I will be back again to enjoy the great looking spa treatments.,5,2012,11,18
218,Michelle is excellent!,"I stayed here on a business trip - arrived late and left early, so I didn't get to see or experience the hotel in its entirety.  However, my room was really lovely - spacious and nicely decorated, great bathroom.  However the best part of the stay was Michelle on reception who was exceptionally friendly and helpful in getting me to the hotel on the night of my arrival and to my business meeting the following morning!  It would make me want to go back when I can have more time in the hotel and would recommend it to others.",4,2012,11,16
218,You might just get lost ...,"I attended a wedding in Killashee House hotel recently with my wife and I was looking forward to the night primarily and to staying in the hotel as a number of friends had said it was nice.

Check in was smooth and efficient and a porter was sent with us .. not to carry our bags but to find our way to our room. In one lift and then a walk through a large reception room and down one of the corridors into another lift and then to our room, I was considering breadcrumbs to mark the way back ! The rooms were large and comfortable, our room had two large double beds. The decor and furniture was good but it was all very dark and dull which gave a less than welcoming feel to the place .. which to be honest the overall experience didn't deserve.

The wedding reception was in a large room on the ground floor, more corridors. The presentation of the room was top class and the food was excellent also but they could have done with having the heating on a bit earlier. I didn't risk taking my jacket off until the dancing started and the toilets never really warmed up at all.

Breakfast the next morning was top class and we really couldn't have asked for better. 

Overall, it is a lovely hotel with large open areas and a maze of corridors leading to function rooms and bedrooms, high ceilings with decor to match and comfortable furniture throughout but, for me, it didn't reach the high expectations I had ... perhaps they were a little too high.

I will probably go back at some stage to see if it will change my mind ... but my first impression left me wanting more.",3,2012,11,14
218,Well needed break,My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel for 2 nights recently. We were very impressed with our overall experience. We were upgraded to a suite on arrival and it was so spacious. We ate in Jack's Bar on both nights as the other restaurant does not open mid-week. The food was delicious and the service was with a smile and a chat and the Guinness was lovely too ! The breakfast room is downstairs and has lovely views onto the gardens and they  deserve to be admired during a walk. There is a butterfly garden also  but obviously during this time of the year they were absent. We did not use the spa  but we did use the swimming pool sauna etc and the pool water temperature was just right. We will be returning to this hotel and many thanks to all the staff.,4,2012,11,11
218,Fairly Good...,"At first glance this looks like a stunning hotel, but on closer inspection, i felt it was a little tired, and could do with a little attention. No sky tv in the rooms or in the tv lounge and loo roll is clearly the cheapest they could buy..! Spa is very good value though, and if you're an equestrian person this is a fabulous location",3,2012,11,08
218,Our wedding day,"We had our wedding reception in the Killashee House 1 month ago. We could not fault one thing, the place is amazing, the staff are fantastic, everything was perfect. We couldn't wish for a more perfect, dream day! The food was to die for,  the waiters even came around with 2nd's for everyone. It was the best day of our lives..

A big thanks to the wedding department who couldn't have done anymore for us, especially Caroline Thank you to everyone at the Killashee for making our day so special and memorable. 

Tinley & Glenn.",5,2012,11,05
218,Autumn villa spa pamper treatment: not to be missed!,"I had the chance and the opportunity to try the Autumn pamper treatment, Swedish back massage, facial treatment,foot massage,head massage,...etc for 99 Euros...in the Villas Spa of the Killashee house hotel, it lasted roughly 2 hours,it was simply amazing.Amy who took care of me, was fantastic, the massage with her was really relaxing, she removed all the tensions I had in my body, especially in my back.The products for the facial and the body wrap were really good products,my skin was as smooth as the skin of a baby and totally re-energised,and so was I! So good value for money,and worth while doing it, if you're down or not!",5,2012,11,02
218,Very nice hotel & spa,I visited here recently for afternoon tea followed by an evening in the spa. The afternoon tea and the selection of treats was amazing! It was excellent value too. We got a table by the window and chilled out before our spa appointment. The staff were lovely and we were really looked after. The spa was amazing also. I got an hour treatment that included a facial and head massage.The staff were superb! I was so impressed! I also got great advice from the beautican who was so friendly and informative. Before your treatment you got served a juice of your choice and could relax in the very pretty relaxation room which was very cosy. I will definitely be returning.,5,2012,10,30
218,Could do with an oomph,"Mixed feelings about this hotel. Hotel bar has a good atmosphere and the food we had was really good, the burger was delicious. However, in the reception area the staff were extremely slow on check in and checking out. They werent even aware that their bar The Priests bar was open...Hmmm. The rooms were nice and big and the bathroom was the largest we've had in a hotel in some time with a separate bath and shower. Downsides, one pillow per person in the bed?? Hairdryer was one of those attached to the wall in the bathroom. Some upgrading required. Also its an absolute maze to try and get from reception to the rooms. As we got the night away for a bargain price I would go back but wouldnt be willing to pay more than the 117e B&B package we paid. Didntrtry the leisure facilities so cant comment on them.",3,2012,10,30
218,Six Ladies On A Two Day Spa Break,"I'm just back from this hotel, we stayed two nights which included two BnB, one dinner and two spa treatments. I dealt with Laura mostly on reception who was very helpful from booking to queries. I booked three twin bedrooms which had two double beds in each and were very clean and airy.
Both breakfasts and our dinner were very enjoyable, all waiting, bar staff and porters we met were excellent. The only bad point was the walk to the spa which is not connected to the hotel.
There was entertainment in the bar both nights much to our enjoyment and a great buzz in general throughout.
Myself and friends will definitely go back.",4,2012,10,28
218,"Fantastic, beautiful hotel. Amazing weekend.","Just returned from a 2 night stay at Killashee for a friend's wedding.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful with fantastic chandeliers and sweeping staircases.  Excellent customer service from start to finish.
Our bedroom was lovely. Spotless, comfortable, grand and with all the amenities you could want/need. 
Dinner was included on the first night which was very well worth the money. 3 courses and we could pick from the full menu.
The wedding in the Saturday was amazing - great reception drinks when we returned from the church ceremony, and I loved that it was afternoon tea with scones instead of canapés. The room where dinner, speeches and dancing were held was breathtaking. Food was exceptional, service great.  I've been to 10 weddings this year alone and this was the best in terms of food and presentation.
I marked the hotel down by one point purely due to the ""spa"" facilities. They were well below the standard you would expect for such an amazing hotel.  The spa is in a separate building behind the hotel and is open to the general public. It was more like a council run leisure centre than a relaxing spa. They make you wear a swimming hat!!! I have NEVER been asked to do this in any spa before. You have to go outside the hotel and cross a car park to get there - no wandering over in your robe and slippers like you would normally do at a hotel spa. I would recommend that the hotel disassociates its name from the spa, but perhaps just offers guests ""full use of the facilities at the leisure centre adjacent to the hotel"". All of our friends who we travelled with shared this opinion too.
Apart from that, we loved it! ",4,2012,10,24
218,Great,We stayed ib kilashee last weekend we had a hens party there we went for dinner the food was lovely we had a lovely girl that served us pauline she was very good to us made sure we had plenty of every thing the next morning at breakfast she was able to explaine to us why the fire alarm went off and was so nice to get extra plaices set up for us had a great weekend thanks so much ,4,2012,10,24
218,Oh Dear... In need of some maintenance,"This hotel is full of promise but somehow it just misses the mark. Beautiful grounds but I get the impression the owner or manager is not around to see what is going on.
Whilst the grounds, hotel and reception area are full of promise the place is very tired. Our room the Abbey Suite had water stained furniture, the bed was uncomfortable, tap in the basin was ready to fall off, shower control missing its cover with only the screw left. Not worth the money.
As a hotelier myself I always check out awards but sadly this place looks as though it was managed well in 2007 and '08 but things have been on a slide since. No awards of any consequence since then and it shows.
Staff on the first night were disorganised and the function we attended was not well done. Food came out before anybody was seated, which meant that everyone would grab a meal, then sit down, which meant the whole evening was a bit haphazard.
Next night was a different story altogether, the A team was on and everything went as smooth as silk. Shame the D team didn't have the training or supervision of the A team.
Breakfast was brilliant both mornings and a nice feature was the new Irish bar that had just opened that looked as though it had been there forever.
Both nights there were people drunk on the grounds until 4am one morning and 8.30am the next who were playing in the fountain, how they got home I don't know??
As I said nice place but the manager seems to be on vacation.",3,2012,10,23
218,exceptional service,We arrived for a wedding at the Killashee hotel and spent two wonderful days there. The service was exceptional as was the food. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were friendly and courteous. The hotel is large and many functions were being held over the weekend many at the same time but this was not at all apparent . The hotel is steeped in history and has been sympathetically restored preserving many of the old features. The only downside the that our bedroom was a litle tired looking and lacked some of the extras that other rooms had . The new addition of the traditional pub is a great idea. It is a delight to find a magnificent privately run hotel.,5,2012,10,22
218,Fab weekend,"Just back from a fab weekend in Killashee House Hotel.  we booked dinner, bed and breakfast in what had been described to us as one of Ireland's best hotels.  we were not disappointed!  The welcome from the check in staff was friendly, courteous and professional.  We got lots of discount vouchers!  10% off in Kildare Village - made good use of that - and discounts at local tourist attractions.  Our room was so comfortable with all the amenities you could ask for.  The food! well, what can i say, a 4 course dinner to write about!  all washed down with an excellent wine chosen for us by the restaurant manager.  Ate too much so had to go to the bar for a shot of Sambuca to settle the tummy, worked a treat.  
Breakfast was no disappointment the next morning - i love getting my breakfast served to the table and it was fresh, not sitting in a bane-marie for hours.  
Killashee is on our list for next year when we need a luxury weekend away.
Thanks to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2012,10,22
218,Nice hotel but disappointing for 4*,"This was my second visit to this hotel. The renovations downstairs in lobby and bar area are lovely and it is a beautiful hotel when you drive up the beautiful driveway and enter the hotel. However, our room was not up to the same standard. The rooms were comfortable but the decor and furniture is very tired and badly need of updating - definitely not 4* hotel room. Had dinner in the bar which was very good-restaurant manager was very accommodating and helpful for our group and the food was lovely. Service was a bit slow but it was very busy so can understand that. Waiting staff at breakfast was a different story- they did not seem to interested in us and was very hard to get their attention even though the restaurant was very quiet at the time  - they spent most the their time gossiping in the corner until a manager came in. The food at breakfast however was very good-nice selection of hot and cold food. I found some of the reception staff were very rude and not interested in serving guests. The fire alarm went off at 5am in the morning - when I mentioned it when checking out, the girl just said someone drunk set it off and that was the end of the conversation.  Even though this was not their fault, an apology on behalf of the hotel would have been nice. I was waiting for a friend in the lobby and noticed their attitude with a number of guests-not just me.  Overall, food is excellent but customer service definitely needs improving in this hotel.",3,2012,10,18
218,Fantastic Value And Service.,"My teenage daughter and I booked a one night stay at Killashee House Hotel & Villa Spa. Our stay included B&B, and Evening Meal in the restaurant. The hotel has a lovely charm about it, with lovely dark wood furniture throughout. It has kept its charm with a magificant staircase from the reception area to the upper floors. We arrived at midday and planned on leaving our bags at reception while we went to visit the Newbridge Silver Museum.. We were delighted to be told our room was ready and we checked in even though checkin was not till 4pm. Room was beautifully furnished in keeping with the old style of the hotel. We enjoyed dinner that evening and could order a four course meal from full menu as part of our stay. Meal was fantastic and the service was exceptional. Breakfast the following morning was served in a large old style drawing room and again was perfect. The Villa Spa is not in the hotel itself but a fair walking distance from the hotel. We went to check it out and were not impressed. Looked like a fairly average beauty salon with a busy gym and pool attached to it.  Overall we had a lovey stay, The weather was great for visiting in the area and we made the most of it. Our stay was terrific value. 168 euro in total. Our evening meal would have cost nearly that on its own. I am looking out for a similar deal, and plan to visit soon with my two sisters.",5,2012,10,17
218,Exquisite!,"Wow what a great hotel,from the moment we walked through the front door until we left.Staff were amazing on all accounts and dinner in Jack's bar was top notch.Front reception staff could not do enough for us to ensure our stay was a memorable one and Philip in Jack's bar had the gift of the gab and made us feel very welcome indeed.Thanks all for making our girlie weekend so special and we will definitely be back!",5,2012,10,08
218,Brilliant weekend break,"My firends and myself(9 of us in total) booked into this hotel last weekend. We had booked a few weeks earlier and were looking forward to it. We arrived on the Friday and from start to finish we were not disappointed. The rooms were beautiful, the Spa was excellent but the most impressive thing was the food, it was fresh, well cooked and beautifully preesented. There was a good choice at breakfast also, I always like fish for breakfast and they had smoked mackerel with poached eggs. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff were friendly and professional, nothing was too much trouble, and believe me when 9 women are together it can be difficult to please everyone. I have raved about this hotel since I have come back, so much so that my husband and myself are hoping to visit end of October, beginning of November. The hotel rates were excellent and worked out very reasonable for us coming from Northern Ireland, sometimes hotels in the Irish republic  can be overpriced but not this one, it was luxury at a very competitive price and well worth the visit.",5,2012,10,04
218,Weddings at Killashee House Hotel,My Husband and I got married in Killashee House Hotel In August of this year. To say that the wedding team went above and beyond is an understatment. From the moment we went to view Killashee as a possible venue Caroline Donnegan made us feel like our wedding was the most important and exciting wedding she had ever helped to coordinate. As a bride to be that is exactly how you want it to be. On the run up to the wedding Caroline was honest and strainght with us although with Caroline helping you felt anything was possible. Every call made to the team in Killashee with questions and the need for appointments were immediately meet. Even when very cheekily asked by the bride and groom on the weeks to set up a sweet buffet that we had organised ourselves it was no problem to Caroline  Not only did the team use all the glass wear we had provided they included some small touches of their own and the result of which was stunning. On the day of the wedding Brian and the rest of the team could not have done more! We only had to turn in Brian's direction and he was at our side. Killashee made our wedding the day the dream come through we had hoped and planned for!!,5,2012,09,30
218,Disappointing stay. I'm afraid it's not worth the money.,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my husband's fortieth birthday. We have stayed at this hotel on two previous occasions and had pleasant experiences on both counts. However, our stay on this occasion was not up to standard. I had paid for a junior suite and was very disappointed with the standard of room 332. The decor was tired and somewhat shabby. The lights did not work properly in the bathroom; they flickered constantly so that we eventually decided to leave them switched off. The television set needs updating and the reception and range of channels was notably poor. RTE 1, our national station, had a fuzzy picture but no sound. There were no proper bath towels in the bathroom. The biggest towels were only slightly larger than a hand towel. I have stayed in suites in other hotels at a lower price but to a higher standard. I am not sure what made our room a suite- was it the fact that it had a large empty space between the doorway and the bed? Two writing desks and a two-seater do not constitute a suite in my opinion, especially at an exorbitant price per night.
I was also taken aback by the presence of a table-cloth bin in Turner's restaurant. The bin was over-flowing with stained tablecloths and I had the misfortune to be seated directly opposite it while I was eating my breakfast. Surely it is common sense to keep something like this out of the  customer's direct sight-line?
Finally I was very disappointed that the hotel did not honour my request for a simple birthday dessert plate for my husband's fortieth. I had emailed them on this matter and was assured it was no problem. Two glasses of champagne on the morning of our departure was an inadequate compensation when neither of us intended to drink and drive that day.
Overall, it is attention to detail that makes a hotel stand out in my opinion. I resented the ridiculous amount of money I dished out for an unremarkable stay at this hotel.",3,2012,09,23
218,"Top Class, from start to finish","After staying in many hotels around Ireland, The Killashee is top of the tree in my opinion, the staff are excellent and the hotel itself is fabulous in its picturesque setting, I highly recommend staying here, we will be back.",5,2012,09,17
218,"Fabulous, luxurious hotel!!!","My husband and I have stayed in this hotel 8 times in total, and go back every year. The hotel is warm, inviting and so fabulous. The rooms are also so comfy, always ask for an upgrade as the reception staff are great for upgrading when you talk nicely to them. Thefood in turners restaurant is always good, regardless of how stuffy and formal the dining room is. I don't like the new bar that was put in a few years back as it distracts from the beautiful old school feel of the hotel itself. The spa is very good, but the staff can be a liitle loud and overbarring in what should be a relaxing, tranquille place. 
Overall, i can not recommend this hotel enough. It caters for everyone, and is beautiful both in the height of summer, or especially on a warm winter's evening.",5,2012,09,17
218,What A Hotel. Real 5* Hotel Which Has Staff That Can Not Do Enough For You.,"I attended a wedding in this hotel over the weekend. From the time that we arrived to the hotel we were Greeted at the door by 2 managers and we felt really welcome. 

Once we walked in through the door the hotel just took our breath away with the decor of the entire hotel. The receptionist were so efficiently upon checking us in. There was a porter on hand to help with our bags to the room. 

The drinks reception was held in a gorgeous gallery area with loads of soft seating for everyone and where the staff were so helpful and always on hand to help in anyway posable. 

When we were called down for dinner the whole way to the function room as very well done with fresh flowers and candles lighting. There was no delay in from the time we took our set, order taken to the bride and groom been introduced into the room which was done through a song. Was class. Really got everyone in the party mood. 

I am still dreaming out the food that we got. Real top class food. I honestly never tasted a beef main course that was so tender (Melt in your mouth) when it came to dancing there was no tables moved around which keep everyone in the room. 

Breakfast the next morning was second to none we got seated with no hassle and was cooked to order. Pure treat. We loved ""jacks bar"" in the hotel with the entire decor tying into the entire hotel. And the food here was just as top class as the food we receved at the wedding. 

The only down thing was we couldn't stay any longer in the hotel to enjoy it more. This hotel is more a 5* hotel than a 4* the entire team in the hotel are young staff who really know what they are doing and all do there job 110% 

I will defiantly return again and will recommend this hotel to anyone who is thinking of getting married. ",5,2012,09,16
218,Nice enough hotel,"After a 2 night stay in a room for 2 adults 2 kids at a cost of 370 I was left wondering why so expensive to be honest.Ok breakfast included which was of fair standard, but the rooms and interior of hotel is all in all a bit dated and drab.Jacks bar was in need of a bit of light very dark for some reason, saying that the staff brightened it up with their chat and banter, food ok. 
Spa and pool very good and found at rear of hotel,we found the hotel busy for weddings and very geared towards this avenue of business. Would recommend this hotel but think for your money there's better out there.",3,2012,09,16
218,Jacks Bar and bistro dull and disappointing,"So always one to give any place a second chance I dined in Killashee house hotel recently with a friend for the second time in Jacks Bar/Bistro. The first occasion was a sunday afternoon so I was a little forgiving after the Sunday lunch rush as the whole experience from service, staff, food was just plain awful. On a quieter evening recently I returned for dinner at around 7 pm. The place was busy enough but messy. Afternnon tea trays had still not been removed from tables, hence a table had to be cleared for us. We were given menus and two minutes later informed the daily special  was finished.. it was Roast beef for gods sake, how exciting can it get and how can a hotel run out of Roast beef!! The staff as always are young students, pleasant enough but no experience, when asking a question the answer was a simple ' I would'nt know'. It was another 15 minutes before our order was taken. The meal was once again poor quality, small portions, overcooked and uninspiring. I will not return there for another meal ,I cant imagine booking a special occasion meal at such quality. I shudder. The decor could seriously do with a face lift. Heavy uncomfortable chairs in cream leather mixed with new grey  modern high back chairs such a mish mash, artifical flowers in vases full of dust on windows ledges... please!!! Its overall, dark, dull, cold and needs a complete re think.I will not be recommending Killashee in the future altough the building and gardens are still magnificent as you drive in.",2,2012,09,14
218,Perfect blend of old world decor  and modern amenities,"Relaxing ,old world charm yet with all modern amenities. Excellent food and value in Jack's bar.Beautifil butterfly garden and walks.A haven of tranquillity. Close to town Naas and IVEA conference centre. .Will definitely go back",5,2012,09,12
218,Rude staff dampened our stay,"Myself and my boyfriend visited Killashee last sunday evening as we were attending the horse racing in The Curragh. On arrival we were told our booking was for a different date after we produced a confirmation e-mail with Sundays date the receptionist swiftly sorted out the mix up and got us our room. Room was lovely, clean and bright. We returned to reception to wait for the taxi we had booked on check-in after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to ask the receptionist would she phone the company to see where our taxi was. We then discovered the taxi was never booked in the first place, the receptionist told us to keep our receipt and the hotel would pay for the taxi as we were now running quite late for our day at the races. We were very impressed the hotel had offered this.

Upon check out we were told by the front desk manager in a very abrupt manor the hotel would not be refunding us as it is not policy. After some discussion she reluctantly agreed and told us that the money would be taken from the wages of the receptionist. 

This really put a dampener on our stay. We loved our room, loved the food in Jack's the staff there were extremely helpful. Breakfast was lovely, again staff very helpful. We ended our stay in the spa which I couldn't recommened enough. 

It's just a shame my most resounding memory of Killashee is that the poor receptionist had to 'pay for our taxi'!!!",4,2012,09,11
218,Couldnt fault yet wouldnt recommend,"We went here for a night away and despite everything been ok just dont feel like I could recommend. Part of the reason we booked this was it looked like more of a manor home/small hotel but once we got there we quickly found it was a 300 room mammoth. Also, we booked this on the basis we could do walks around the ground but once we got a map from reception it was clear the walks were all v short and that the ones on the map were for future plans and were not yet developed. Finally, the Spa/Gym are across the car park and are not part of the hotel. We were under the impression this was part of the hotel. Despite these issues the food was excellent in the hotel and the staff very helpful. However on departing just felt it was an average hotel.",3,2012,09,11
218,Great staff,"Arrived tired after long trip. Went straight to the pool which is located in a seperate building. Pool was very good and the gym was huge and very busy. Pool was extremely clean and perfect temperature. No lifeguard though. The room was very good. External appearance of the hotel is very good. Food was good. the bar where we eat was a bit too warm and stuffy. More aircon needed here. Waitress - Anita was very good, very friendly. On checkout I got great help from the receptionist and a porter as well as an other guest when my car failed to start. Check out Newbridge for shopping and Kildare Village Shopping Centre if you feel like spending big money.",5,2012,09,04
218,Excellent!,"I had the pleasure of an overnight stay at Killahsee recently. 
The customer service was second to none - one of the best expepriences i have had in this country. The staff team are a young team - all very engaging, friendly and helpful. 
The food was beautiful and the attention to the table was excellent without being false or overbearing.
I would highly recommend Killahsee for a break - only wish i could have had a week there ! 
Please go if you can and enjoy this experience - it is delightful to see that as a country we have not lost our ability to make people feel welcome and go the extra mile.",5,2012,08,27
218,Family trip,"Very nice first impression,beautiful on the outside,nice lobby and bar area.Rooms were a disaster to find,it is like a maze.We had to go upstairs to go downtstairs in another area of the hotel.Bottom line it was a big effort to find our way around each time.I had a few kids with me who wanted to swim,lovely pool but located in a separate building which again is difficult to find.They had a very large gym but I had no incentive to use it as it was too difficult to findI would not be keen to stay here again!",3,2012,08,27
218,Beautiful reception & bar but room musty & a real let down especially for €160 per night.,"The Killashee House Hotel is a lovely place as you enter.  The reception area and bar are very impressive. Beautiful marble counter tops and floors. Chandeliers everywhere. However, our room was a far cry from this. It took us about 7 minutes to walk to it from the reception area. It was a ""Superior room"" but I'm not sure what that meant apart from the fact that they charge accordingly for calling it that. It was dark and musty. Nothing at all fancy about it. Our clothes smelt of the same mustiness when we got home.  The staff at breakfast were curt and uninformative and we were waiting for our order for breakfast to be taken for a half hour before my husband had to go and ask someone to serve us. The lady on reception didn't ask on check out if everything was ok but just said thanks and have a good day. We would return for lunch perhaps but never for a night away.",3,2012,08,25
218,Got married here it was a magical experience.,"The Killashee House hotel was where we had out beautiful wedding. The whole process from start to finish was so professional, courteous and great value for money for such an amazing venue. The staff couldn't do enough for us and I felt so safe and well cared for throughout our stay. The rooms are gorgeous and enormous. Food was top notch (some of my guests are still talking about the lamb). I would highly recommend.",5,2012,08,24
218,Outstanding Service at a Beautiful Hotel!,"My hubby and I made our first trip to Ireland for an international convention in Saggart mid-July. There were around 9,000 in attendance so the resort in Saggart was fully booked fairly quickly. For once, our procrastination was the best thing that could have happened because the Killashee House agreed to have some of our group (almost 150 of us) stay with them in Naas (about 30 minutes away). We knew this would be a great trip when even the reservation desk easily handled our many emails and changes. It was really easy to get to Naas from the Dublin airport, we just took the Dublin Coach N7 for €10 each one-way. After about a 30 minute ride it dropped us in the middle of town, sort of near the post office. This was perfect because it's right there at a taxi stand. Then the three of us piled into a van with all our bags for €10 to get over to Killashee House. It was only 5-10 minutes from town. PS> The town of Naas is super cute and the people were totally friendly and helpful. We were also able to take the JJ Kavanagh and Sons Coach from town to visit other places quickly and cheaply. 
From the very first night that we arrived we were treated so wonderful. Our flight was super late so when we got there the manager at Jack's did everything he could to arrange for us a bite to eat since the kitchen was closed. Speaking of food...TOP QUALITY! Between the lamb shank, salmon, mouth-watering chicken, shall I go on? We ate so good that I kept the menu from each day just so I could try to replicate it when I came home. =) Oh and the desserts were crazy good! We loved the dining atmosphere...for breakfast the room has so many windows and is so bright and beautiful that you can't help but wake up and feel perky. And for dinner, Jack's has seating areas that made us feel like we could be in whatever setting we wanted from a gorgeous, urban, swanky, lounge-like supper club in Manhattan, New York, to sitting looking out the windows at a garden setting, to comfy sofa, community-style restaurant. I don't know how they managed to get all these different vibes in such a cohesive space, but aside from the food being awesome, it kept us from being bored. And the large banquet rooms for our weekend meals were so beautiful...there were candles and roses and staff gliding in and around to serve us. I swear they choreographed dinner! 
Our room (and my mother's) was big and beautiful and never had any issues. It was never a problem if we requested more towels or water. Someone was always there quickly to serve us.
The staff (front desk, dining, room service) was totally amazing. They were so busy because besides the normal travelers and spa-goers coming in and out, there were numerous weddings and events happening at the same time, but they made us feel first-class...it was like they were only there to assist us.
I've traveled a lot, but their staff puts others to shame! There was no crazy American request that the Killashee staff didn't handle with grace and a smile. We stayed almost a week and a half, but by the time we left Killashee, we felt like we were leaving behind close friends and family! We only wish we could find service that was as friendly, courteous, and professional as we found there. Whoever is doing the hiring there knows what they're doing.
Our biggest regret? We regret that we had to leave. We would love to stay in that house at entry of the property. Please contact us if it's available. =) The second biggest regret?  We wish we would've had more time to walk through the beautiful gardens, but at least we had the most beautiful view of them out our window every morning!
I just want to say this last thing. When my hubby and I were courting, we talked about where we'd like to travel and we both immediately agreed that there was something about Ireland that fascinated us. When we got married, we didn't get a honeymoon, so this year being our 5th anniversary we knew we wanted to do something special. Well when the opportunity came up for us to be international delegates for the ""Safeguard Your Heart"" Convention, we knew this was meant for us! The Killashee House gave us an experience that we will remember forever, and visiting Ireland has been a dream come true. Thank you so much for everything!!!",5,2012,08,23
218,Superb hotel in every way!,"We are just back from a mini break in Killashee. We brought our kids with us. We normally go without the kids.
Well what a great break. Wonderful value.
We had a meal included in Jacks and it was delicious. So good the kids made us eat there again the next night!
Great pool area,lovely grounds. We had great fun exploring!
The kids loved the quirkiness of the building and it was lovely to show them some of the original features of the hotel.
Staff were fabulous and could not do more for us.
Food was wonderful,breakfast a real treat. My daughter particularly enjoyed her waffles with chocolate sauce and strawberries,a special request from which was acceded to without any hassle.
We cannot wait to go back!
Special thanks to Anita in reservations for all her help.",5,2012,08,22
218,"great service ,great staff, great stay","myself and my wife stayed in this hotel for 2 nights recently and we were more than impressed with this hotel. we had dinner in jacks bar and the food was delicious the staff were very friendly especially our waitress nadine. the ladies at reception were very nice ,courteous , professional especially lisa who had a great manner and was extremely helpful. we were brought to our rooms by a great young man robert who was very friendly and full of conversation and was able to tell us some of the buildings history when we got to our rooms i attempted to give him a tip and he told me ""thats not necessary sir, just enjoy your stay"" we felt truly welcomed by all staff and felt as though we were not just another paying guest. we will definately return!!",5,2012,08,21
218,A great break for families with young kids,We had a wonderful time at the Killashee House Hotel. The family Summer Fun package was great value as it included breakfast for 2 adults and 3 kids and a four course meal on one evening. The kids had a great time in the swimming pool and running around exploring the gardens. The staff were very good and the food was excellent. We really felt relaxed after our stay. Lovely cooked breakfasts and plenty of lounge areas to sit while our young kids played. We will definitely be back.,5,2012,08,20
218,Very nice hotel,Overall I had a very pleasant stay in Killashee House Hotel. The decor was fab and the gardens very pleasant.  There are two options for eating in the hotel. We opted for the more relaxed Jack's bar. The food was nice and service was good. The pool and leisure facities were also of a high standard. I  availed of a massage and facial in the Villa spa which is located on the hotel grounds. The spa itself and the treatments I selected were excellent. In particular I would like to give special mention to Angela who looked after me and gave great advice and a high quality customer service. My only gripe with the hotel was the time the leisure facility closed at on Saturdays (6.30pm). My partner and I felt that this was quite early considering check in time was three o'clock. By the time we checked and got settled it left us with only a short time to avail of the facilities. Not a huge issue in what was a pleasant stay.,4,2012,08,20
218,Very disappointed,"We booked a spa break , to enjoy some relaxation . One of the girls was heavily pregnant and the others gettin away from a busy life with small kids hence looking for some sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be the case . The first night we were awoken by other guests screaming shouting ,running up and down the corridors knocking on our doors the night porter could not control the situation and it went on for two hours . After speaking to the receptionist about what happened we were made to feel like a burden and told this is out of there control. On our second night we were again awoken by a fire alarm been activated at 4am , we were told this was out of there control which is fair enough however an apology could have been offered and a little politeness around the situation . The staff in this hotel were very impersonal and appeared to have the weight of the world on there shoulders . The food however was fabulous especially in the restaurant but the service in the bar was very poor ,one example is we ordered a apple pie and got a cheese board the guy who served us kept on cracking jokes about my friends baby bump . The hotel is very clean and food very good And spa area was unreal staff in this area really know how to make one feel welcome ,would have liked to have a better experience as hotel very near a lot of amenities could become a nice treat every so often",2,2012,08,18
218,"Attended a wedding here and stayed over, quality hotel lovely staff great food","We stayed here last night after our friends wedding. When booked on phone the lady was extremley nice and efficient. Check in was taken care of by another lady who was friendly efficient and polite. Room was nice, clean, fresh. The beds were comfortable and the ensuite lovely bright and clean. Great shower. 
The wedding was great, food was A1, staff very efficient and helpful. That leaves breakfast which was lovely and again staff were on the ball and polite. Check out fast efficient and friendly.

Maybe a little more expensive than some hotels and I only say ""maybe"" but you get what you pay for.

I've already decided to stay again in the near future.",5,2012,08,18
218,Will be coming back..,"Staff at this hotel are the most helpful that I have come across in a long time. We stayed here after a previous hotel had let us down, family with 3 small children. Nothing was a problem. Went to the restaurant on both nights to eat the restaurant manager could not do enough for us. Receiption were 100% very helpful. Breakfast was super and accommodated children. Kids loved it. Swimming pool and gym is huge and again great facility. 
Only down side is all the different levels to the hotel, not a huge problem but it's the only down side I would have to say. 

Over all we had a great stay so keep up the good work and looking forward to coming back.",5,2012,08,12
218,Ideal Wedding Location,"We attended a wedding the August Bank holiday weekend. On entering the hotel the grounds are very grand. All the staff reception, bar staff, waiters and management went out of their way for us.
The wedding meal was one of the best I've ever had (the steak was amazing).Breakfast the next day was delicious with fresh juice, cereals and a choice of hot breakfasts cooked to order which were a 10/10. 
The decor is old world and the rooms are decorated to a very high standard. I would definitely  recommend this hotel.",5,2012,08,07
218,Very relaxing stay..,We stayed here for one night. There was a wedding on that night and the receptionist ensured our room was well away form the wedding party. There was no noise in the corriders and the staff were very friendly. Breakfast was fantastic the next morning. Lovely hotel for a relaxing break.,5,2012,08,07
218,Great Location close to Kildare Shopping Village,"Bearing in mind I wanted my perfect spa’s location to be equidistant from both the North and South, close to the motorways and close to a great shopping venue, I decided upon on the Killashee House Hotel, Naas, Co. Kildare. This glorious property is set amongst 280 acres of manicured gardens & parklands with magnificent views over the Wicklow Mountains and Kildare countryside. From the hotels beautifully appointed bedrooms to the indulgent services available, Killashee offers the highest standards of comfort, service & cuisine. Its ideally located just 2kms outside Naas.
On arrival on Friday evening at about 7pm we were shown to our deluxe room and prepared for a light supper. Once seated there was a glass or two of white wine and supper in “Jacks Bar “ which consisted of melt in the mouth Lamb shank and Tagliatelle Pasta followed by desserts and  a couple of Chocolate mousses.

After a delightful breakfast in “Turners” restaurant, it was grab the bikinis because it was spa time. My girls had booked a 2-Night Relaxation Spa Break (Twin Room) costing €189.00 which included a 2-Night Stay in a Deluxe Twin Room En suite, full Irish Breakfast 4-Course Table d'hote dinner and some spa treatments and full use of Leisure Centre.
Love the place great service and superb spa",5,2012,08,03
218,Wonderful experience,"I attended a family wedding and was so impressed with everything.  Staff, service and food all excellent. The rooms were to an excellent standard.  Lots of charming touches like the array of candles on the way to the dining room.  Breakfast was fabulous, cooked to perfection. The most charming hotel I've ever been to.",5,2012,08,03
218,Outstanding Hotel!,"We stayed in this hotel as a girls night away and it was fantastic. From the relaxing treatments in the Villa Spa to the excellent food, We were so impressed. Overall, the hotel has a great atmosphere, the bar was busy with live music. 
Couldn't recommend it enough.",5,2012,07,31
218,wonderful stay,"We had a pleasent and wonderful time at the Killashee hotel in Ireland.  the staff, food and room was oustanding.  My wife and I enjoyed very much. I would recomend it to any one. We had every morning a very good beakfast and in the evening a wonderful meal (dinner).  The staff was very helpful and courtesy was the normal, it was a pleasent atmosphere.  We liked the old Victorian flair.",5,2012,07,25
218,Convention stay,"We stayed her all inclusive for a week in order to attend a convention.  I have to concur with all the positive things said about this hotel. Due to a busy schedule I regret not being able to walk the beautiful grounds or use the spa, but those in our party of 140 who did, thoroughly enjoyed them. The meals were superb, Salmon as I have never tasted and the Lamb shank was ordered two days in a row. This would be a great place for a wedding as they handled our group very well. Front desk was prompt and attentive for any request.",5,2012,07,25
218,Caitriona's and Brian's Wedding,"From the moment we walked in the doors into a vast reception we knew we were going to love this hotel. We were attending the  wedding of our good friends, Caitriona and Brian and were looking forward to staying the night. We were not disappointed. The room was big and very comfortable and above all spotless.
The food at the wedding reception was Fabulous and the service was excellent.
The entertainment area was huge and perfect for a great time.
Breakfast the next day was great, followed by a walk in the lovely gardens. We have a brilliant time and we will be back.
Small downside was the price of a bottle of beer. At €5.30 per bottle I thought this was a little expensive.",5,2012,07,24
218,Make Punchestown magic!,"If you are thinking of attending the Punchestown Festival then Killashee House is THE place to stay for the best racing atmosphere in town. Not only will you find yourself in the most beautiful surroundings and a building steeped in history, charm and absolute luxury but you will be surrounded by like-minded folk who are friendly and fun and definitely up for 'the craic'.  The staff are extremely friendly as well, and also polite and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them to make sure you have a wonderful time.  Just minutes from the racecourse with a free shuttle bus to take you there and back, and minutes from Naas should you actually be tempted to leave the fabulous atmosphere of the hotel bars in the evening, there really is only one place to stay if you want to be immersed in Festival feeling day and night and that is why I have already booked my room for next year and am counting the months until I go back.",5,2012,07,24
218,Anniversary lunch,"WEwent threre with our family for our anniversary, the food and service was brillant, and the place is fantastic, we had been there a few months ago for our little grandsons christening, my daughter and son in law booked a room and it was really great and the food was great, I would recommend this hotel for any wedding, party or just for lunch, it is well worth a visit",5,2012,07,19
218,Great stay at Killashee house hotel,"Would definitely recommend this hotel only 40 minutes from Dublin. A real gem of a find on beautifully kept grounds. Excellent facilities pool leisure centre very clean and friendly staff. Very comfortable rooms. The restaurant is top class better than any in previous hotels I've stayed in. Great deal on their website would recommend this for couples, great value for one night, dinner, breakfast and use of the leisure centre. I will be back again soon!",5,2012,07,18
218,My Dream Hotel,"A group of girls went here for a fantastic weekend. From the moment you come up the driveway its WOW. The house is just so perfect and in a perfect surrounding. The staff were friendly and efficient and the rooms huge. 

The hotel bar is very new and modern. While not fitting in with the House's old style it works. The bar food was delish and the cocktails moreish :) 

We enjoyed an evening in the hotels Spa which is located in the Leisure centre across the car park. Very enjoyable. The leisure centre has jacuzzi, steam room and sauna facilities. 

The breakfast was one of the most varied I have ever had. They had everything! We ate dinner one night in the hotel restaurant and it was absolutely divine. My compliments to the chef! 

I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, I will be returning someday.",5,2012,07,17
218,My big day!,"I stumbled upon Killashee in a wedding magazine and went to visit it to check it out for my wedding venue. Upon arrival it did not disappoint and looked exactly as it did in the photo.

We booked this venue shortly after visiting it in person and looked forward to our big day in July this year. Im on honeymoon at the moment but am writing this review promptly as I want the staff at killashee to know they are amazing and I really enjoyed my wedding on 12th july especially because of the service they gave me not only on the day but throughout the year.

Nothing was too much trouble. Caroline and Lisa answered any queries i sent them promptly and on the day Caroline excelled herself. She had 4 pages of details about what was to happen on my wedding day and on the day it showed that her attention to detail payed off.

So long story short thanks so much to the staff at Killashee hotel i had best wedding ever and i would def recommend this venue for a wedding or a weekend away. I ate in jacks bar the night before my wedding and the food was excellent there also.",5,2012,07,15
218,Friends Wedding,"My friend had his wedding here, and i must admit i was very impressed with the hotel, the staff, the food, the gardens. easily accessible from Dublin.
The room was fantastic, I didn't get to enjoy the spa, but will visit again.",5,2012,07,14
218,Fantastic hotel!,"We stayed here in December and were really impressed with the place.  Great grounds around the hotel, nicely out in the countryside but not a million miles from the motorway and the likes of Kildare Village.  The rooms are very clean, very big and in original style but with a modern bathroom.  Great breakfast.  Would stay here again in a second.",5,2012,07,14
218,Thank you for the best day of my life!,"To say we were delighted with everything at Killashee is an understatement! From our initial research into wedding venues, Killashee House stood out above all others. The setting is obviously beautiful, the Thomson suite layout is excellent, hotel is spotless, food delicious and the staff are so friendly and professional. In particular, I have to mention my wedding coordinator Caroline who was magnificent...nothing was too much for her from dealing with my initial queries to my more frantic queries and stresses as the big day loomed closer! Caroline even organised for my DIY candy buffet to be set up by the hotel staff so I wouldn't have to worry about it and told me that in no way was I to come near the hotel the day before the wedding and to organise other people to do deliveries of cake, luggage etc as I would have enough to do and she was dead right!! So thank you Caroline for that and everything else!
The atmosphere of the hotel is wonderful-classic understated luxury but with a friendly feel.
Everything on the day itself was perfect! Arrival reception went down a treat esp the complimentary Killashee cocktail and the ballroom looked absolutely stunning with the in-house florist Richard matching the floral displays with my bouquets-that's the sort of attention to detail you get at Killashee! 
The food was amazing...our sincere compliments to the chef and kitchen staff. The waiters, waitresses and bar staff were exceptionaland so efficient! A special wired of thanks to Una, our catering manager on the day-our little boy was sick with a tummy bug on the day and Una was so good to him, arranging for a big armchair for him to curl up in to be set up behind our top table so we could keep an eye on him and also arranged for some dry toast and flat 7up for him as well as a babysitter for the night - her help was truly appreciated and just another example of the exceptional service proffered by Killashee staff.  We also received such wonderful feedback from our guests about all aspects of the hotel. Thank you so much for making our wedding celebration a truly memorable day and we wish you all the very best fir the future! ",5,2012,07,10
218,Absolute Gem,"Just back from a weekend here.  Absolute fabs.  Three girls away for the weekend shopping etc.

When booking phoned hotel direct and told them what price we got on web but we wanted dinner included and came back with a fantastic offer that we could not have bettered.  Booking staff very helpful and friendly

Arrived and very quickly checked in and room was great.  Two large double beds and a camp bed.  The matress on camp bed was absolutely great and one of the girls who used it said it was almost like a memory foam matress and slept like a log.  Lovely fruit basket and fresh spring water waiting in room on arrival.  A real proper hairdryer which was great not like the ones you get in some bathrooms of hotel or a miniture travel one.  A proper size one. Extra pillows in cupboard.  Loads of room and beautiful room overlooking gardens.

We had a 4 course meal in our deal and fab.

Unfortunately one of our party was not feeling well as we were eating (nothing to do with food) and as I already had had a second drink couldnt drive.  One of the receptionist organised us to go to the local K doc next to pharmacy and dropped us down herself in her own car and told us to phone her when we were ready and she would come and get us which she did.  She knew all necessary details regarding time and pharmacy opening hours. What could have ruined our weekend was well taken care of and we were able to go on and enjoy our weekend.

When we returned to hotel the restaurant manager had our deserts ready for us and sat us back down at our table and ensured that we were able to relax and this morning both staff members came to ensure all was okay with us.

Food was beautiful Meal was gorgeous at night and huge choice for breakfast.  We are definately going back there together with the girls and with our partners.

The only thing to note is that you do have to walk outside and through a car park to get to the spa and swimming pool and as it was pouring in the morning we would have gotten soaked so even if they could get a covered walkway it would be great.  We had asked not be put over the function rooms.  There were two weddings on and we heard absolutely nothing of the music which was great.

Beautiful building, settings, food and exceptionally friendly staff.  Other hotels should take note of the staff.  Whether it was receptionist, cleaners, bar staff we were made feel so welcome and we can say we were totally catered for. A joy to stay and would definately recomend.",5,2012,07,08
218,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed here last weekend, and I have to say it was one of the most enjoyable weekends away we've ever had.  We knew from the reviews and the website that it was going to be a lovely place.  But it far exceeded our expectations.  The hotel itself and the surrounding area is gorgeous.  As the weather was bad we only left the hotel once to go shopping in the nearby Kildare Outlet Village, and we weren't bored for a second while in the hotel.  We stayed in a luxourious suite which was fantastic.  Massive four poster bed, really spacious room, large bathroom with jacuzzi bath also.  We ate in the restaurant the first evening on the Friday, where the food and service were both excellent.  I have worked in 5 star hotels and it was definitely 5 star standard.  Was so impressed with the service.  Breakfast both mornings was delicious.  Although the hotel was very busy, the service never slipped and hot food came out promptly.  Lovely cold buffet as well.  On the Saturday we had the afternoon tea which was beautifully presented, and tasted as good.  As there was a lot of eating in the afternoon tea, we had a late dinner in the bar.  The food here was also excellent.  As the hotel was busy between wedding, racing and hen parties, there was a great atmosphere and live music.  All in all had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,07,06
218,Great food - pity about the rooms,"Stayed recently with party of 5. Two were happy enough with rooms two were unhappy and one very unhappy.
The decor is slightly dated and although very clean rooms felt ""tired"". One occupant had to call night porter to try and stop fan noise in bathroom which persisted despite removing key card from wall expecting all electric items to switch off - noise persisted. At 5.00 am a compressor started outside two of the rooms and sleep was disrupted. No direct access to lobby from one side of hotel - have to use two different lifts and use a warren of corridors.
On the plus side the food was excellent and breakfast almost made up for a bad night's sleep.
Grounds were very nice - did not use the spa.",3,2012,07,06
218,Bar service is poor,"I like this hotel, 2nd visit in a few months, but as last time, my experience in the bar left a bad taste in my mouth (if you pardon the pun) The restaurant obviously ensures staff are trained to be good with customers, however the bar staff are equally important. 2 different glasses of red wine, both non drinkable. The response from the young barman was poor, he'd change them when he was ready... After an order of 12 cocktails! Thankfully I asked another barman to help. Thing is, I then had to listen to him give out about it... An expensive night in hotel and restaurant spoiled, by this. 
I went to restaurant for some wine and we retired to our room. 

Similar experience last time we stayed too. This was when cheeky barman gave out to guest for asking for Brandy glass, this after he'd paid for a wedding for hos daughter the previous day.

Please train bar staff, it may prevent a return and cost you points within Trip Advisor which can affect bookings.",4,2012,07,02
218,Perfect Weekend Break,"We stayed Saturday night June 16th and knew from the moment we entered the driveway that this hotel was something special! 
From the beautiful foyer, elegant dining room and cosmopolitan bar, to the peaceful and comfortable bedrooms we found each and every aspect of the hotel to be of the highest standard.  All the staff were really courteous and helpful, Laura on reception gave us loads of information along with the 'buddies benefits' page.  We used this the next day and enjoyed our discount at Newbridge, Kildare Outlet Village and The Japanese Gardens.  There was a wedding on the same day - I know it's a highly popular wedding veune and a glorious location for wedding photographs (see sample albums in the foyer).  We did not hear a sound from the wedding either during the day or night, nor was there any delay at check-out next morning.  Our 4-course meal in Turners was excellent.   I used the Spa facilites next morning before tucking into a delicious and delightful breakfast.  Before heading off, we enjoyed a quiet walk in the gardens and stopped off at the peaceful Nun's Graveyard.  We were sorry to leave on Sunday morning and hope to return in the very near future.",5,2012,07,01
218,Killashee or Downton?,"Magnificent property in Kildare with stunning gardens, lovely and perfectly appointed bedrooms.
Staff friendly and helpful.  We had traveled from Provence and booked midweek special (before returning to US) that included King room with 2 full Irish breakfasts and 1 four course meal in Jack's Bar.  Food in the bar was just ok; breakfasts were sumptuous.  Put on your walking shoes @ hotel - although there are only 3 floors, one has to use lifts to go up and down and all around to get to 2nd floor - it was worth it!
Wifi available in public areas only and television very limited channel selection.  
Highly recommend Killashee",4,2012,06,27
218,"Service, staff & quality excellant","I stayed here for a wedding over the weekend. I cannot recommend your hotel enough.

We were greated with a smile, and helpful information about the hotel and facilities, I didn't expect the room to be ready, having a hotel back ground myself I understood there could have been a wait....... Which there wasn't, there was a porter to hand to help with luggage if needed. The only thing I thought was a bit odd was the manager wearing flip flops but the hotel may have a quirkey relaxed laid back attitude to uniforms.

The rooms was spotlessly clean and huge.

The bar staff, f&b staff are a credit to the hotel, cant do enough for you! You can really see they are standards and service driven! 

Compliments to the chef the beef was amazing the best I've had in a long time, duck also was excellant.

Breakfast in the morning was very busy but plenty of staff around and didn't seem panicked or under pressure, food again excellant.

Over my stay I had dealing with Michelle and Laura at reception, and must say they are a credit to the company, where ever you got the from must miss them alot! 

Well done to everyone:0)

218,A very special hotel.,"From Arrival to departure , this was one of  the best hotel breaks we have ever had, From the chicken wings in the bar to the 4 course meal in turners restaurant, the food and the staff were excellent, Hotel staff are friendly and efficient, three receptionists on duty.
The bar and Restaurant were both very nice, and the quality of the food was out of this world, 
I would highly recommend this hotel for a romantic break away, or for a special occasion.
one of the best in Ireland at affordable pricing.",5,2012,06,18
218,Sheer Bliss,"This is a fantastic venue for many occasions - relaxation, corporate and without a doubt it has to be up there with the BEST Wedding venues. It has it all, gardens are fantastic, rooms are superb and all of this combines to what must be every bride's dream.
Its also suitable for couples as a romantic hide-away!
A good venue for families also with a high quality leisure centre.",5,2012,06,06
218,Mixed experience,"We stayed for 2 nights (Friday & Saturday) on a tour package so don't know the rate paid. Our room in Belling wing was lovely:large,bright,airy (the weather was very hot!) & the bathroom very well appointed with a walk in shower as well as a bath and 2 basins. We got used to the odd route to the room--it was a long but quite pleasant walk & involved  going up then down by lift.  Our deal included dinner each evening in Turners- this is a lovely room with pleasant,helpful staff although service can be slow. Friday's dinner was excellent,especially the starters.& the coffee with petit fours is a nice touch. Saturdays dinner was a huge disappointment--firstly the menu is a repeat of the previous evening.We were offered the bistro menu as an alternative when we queried the repetition but it didn't appeal & some dishes were also on Turners. When our meals did arrive the main courses were well below the standard of the previous evening.We had a long wait for dessert orders to be taken--the waitress apologised for the delay. We had been impressed with the hotel up to this point but would now have reservations about a weekend there.",4,2012,06,02
218,Excellent all round service and facilities,"I have been a member of the country club here for a year and my sister got married here last July.  I have since moved away from the area and my membership has recently lapsed, so it is only now that I fully appreciate how great the facilities in the hotel are.  The food is always superb, the gym facilities are excellent (and very competitively priced) and the hotel rooms are always immaculate.  The staff go out of their way to help and are always friendly and courteous.  If I could find somewhere even vaguely similar near my current location, I would be very happy.",5,2012,05,23
218,"very enjoyable, would recommend to others","I've been to this hotel for 2 weddings - a summer and a winter one, both of which were very enjoyable. the rooms we stayed in were both very spacious & pleasant, & we got a really good price both times. the hotel itself is very charming and deceptively big - i got lost going from the banquet hall to my room...! breakfast in the morning is delicious so i would recommend having that included in your stay. overall a lovely experience each time, and i would recommend to others.",5,2012,05,13
218,"Nice hotel but the spa & gym are in a different building and the bar is so noisy you have to shout, even during the day","Rooms are very nice, big and clean really comfortable. We booked my parents in for my moms 60th birthday and when at the desk striking a deal for price the staff were arguing with each other, not professional! 
We had afternoon tea in the dining room which was a very pleasant room, very quiet & we asked for this specifically as Jacks bar is very dark and so noisy you can't talk to each other you have to shout. Food was good although it used to be a lot better. 
Overall this is a nice hotel, they have made some changes to the reception area layout and decor & it used to be a lot better but still overall not bad. The rooms are very far away from the gym and spa and there is no bathrooms on the ground floor where the bar & restaurant are which is a bit awkward when you have kids with you. 
If the weather is good the gardens are a really nice spot to sit out in.
",3,2012,05,07
218,Very pretty hotel,We recently stayed here for a wedding. It was really enjoyable but the hotel was quite busy. The rooms were standard compared to other hotels and very difficult to find especially at the end of the night! The wedding itself was lovely and so was the food. The service was very good and everyone had a great time.,3,2012,05,02
218,Weekend Wedding Trip,"My husband and I recently attended a wedding at the Killashee House Hotel which was held in Turner's Restaurant, an absolutely beautiful venue.  The ceremony and surroundings were what movies are made from.  We booked for the weekend, so the following afternoon we had lunch in Jack's.  Our waiter told us about the specials which inclued Guinness Stew.  I only eat Guinness Stew when I visit Ireland, so I was excited by the prospect of lunch.  I did however remember that the groom had arranged a formal dinner  that evening for the dozen or so guests that stayed on.  I asked Joe our waiter if he would save me a serving and maybe I could have the Guinness Stew at dinner.  He assured me he would but, I would have to ask my waiter in the evening.  At dinner I explained to my waiter Tom about the  stew that Joe had saved for me, he chuckled at my request but sure enough he delivered my serving.  Kudoos to Joe and Tom they went the extra distance!",5,2012,04,28
218,a grand stay in a grand old place,"Had a great short stay at the Killashee during the Punchestown race festival.

The hotel is a grand old thing that actually used to be a Nunnery.
It's a real old fashioned place with great colour, lush furniture and fittings, a great sense of history and a real sense of grandour.
There lots of weddings here and you can see why, its very plush.

My room was very clean and old fashioned, bathroom was immaculate.
Food was great, service was great and the drinks were not badly priced (for a hotel anyway).
Staff were very pleasant and helpful and not able to fault the place at all.

Location is about 3 mile away from Naas high street (e8 taxi) and there's plenty of good bars and places to eat here if you fancy getting out and about.

Pool, sauna, jacuuzi, gym etc all available and enjoyed them all.  

A great stay at a great place.",5,2012,04,26
218,"Excellent service, lovely room and surroundings","Went away for a night with mum and sister, we had a beautiful time. The staff wre really helpful and did everything to make the stay really enjoyable. The spa and very relaxing and dinner was excellent. Our room was very spacious with beautiful decor, especailly the wallpaper. Will def. go back soon for another treat. Lovely foyer to sit and relax and people watch.",4,2012,04,24
218,Great weekend in Killashee,Very good service in the dining room.  Room excellent. Jack's bar and diner staff could be more friendly and welcoming.  But overall a very enjoyable weekend!,4,2012,04,24
218,"One night stay, would consider going back",Stayed here on the 20th of April for one night as I was attending a friends wedding with my wife. Unfortunately I didn't get to enjoy the full facilities the hotel has to offer but what I did experience was very good. Nice clean rooms and good service. The hotel is quite big and a little bit scattered in its lay out but had a very good time all the same.,5,2012,04,22
218,Faded Grandeur,"I had occasion to ring the hotel before our spa break and, just as a ‘by the way’, checked if dressing gowns and slippers were supplied. They were not, unless ordered in advance! I duly ordered them. The driveway leading to Killashee House is splendid as is the view of the house and grounds. The lobby is dark but well-furnished and has an olde worlde charm. At reception they announced that we’d been upgraded which came as a welcome surprise, and that our dressing gowns were in the room. The trek to the bedrooms saw me becoming a little less enamoured. A lift took us up three floors and then we had a very long walk (anyone using a Ryan Air Terminal will know what I mean) to another lift which took us down two floors. Throughout our stay we met confused residents unable to discover their rooms. 
Our room was clean with a good sized bed and a small television sitting inside a very large TV cabinet. There was no fridge, no mini bar, but there was a kettle and a supply of tea bags. The kettle had seen better days and one had to be careful of the steam escaping through the handle as it boiled. Despite the beautiful grounds our window overlooked a vast expanse of tarmacadammed car park. So much for the upgrade! I had an immediate appointment for a treatment at the spa but there were no dressing gowns in the room. I lifted the phone to call reception and it fell to pieces in my hand! Thankfully, I cobbled it together, got through to reception, complained about the phone and lack of dressing gowns and was assured of immediate attention. I couldn’t wait – I had to find the spa. Another walk, down one floor in the lift and follow the arrows to a door marked Villa Spa. It opened onto a filthy outdoor staircase (blackbirds were building their nests in the eaves and the stairs were littered with twigs and cigarette butts). The Spa was on the other side of the large car park and I walked through the icy rain to get to it. Killashee House fails to state the distance between the hotel and spa and also that the leisure suite, gym, pool etc. is open to the general public. If one is expecting a relaxing swim or sauna, this is not the place for you. Hotel guests were expected to walk in their dressing gowns (provided) through the large gym where a number of people had come to work out on the weekend and to share the steam rooms with them. On a bank holiday weekend, the pool was quite full with families. I decided not to use these facilities. 
Far from feeling relaxed after my treatment I arrived back in my room exhausted and soaked to the skin. Umbrellas are not supplied by either the spa or the hotel. I decided to take a nap. The mattress was good quality and very hard which is ok if you like that. The pillows were equally hard and uncomfortable. Unfortunately, just as I was dozing off, my partner decided to wash his hands and the plumbing sprang to life like an old fashioned steam train running along a rickety track. I literally leapt up in fright. I just wanted to go home at that stage but my partner had organised the trip so that I could spoil myself for a weekend so I gritted my teeth and decided to take a shower before dinner. The bathroom had a bath with a shower head and a free standing shower with a glass door. It looked fairly modern and there was a plentiful supply of hot water but the door stubbornly refused to close unless really yanked shut. The same amount of force had to be applied in order to escape it. The hair dryer extended from the wall like a hoover hose with a nozzle on the end – not ideal but… I began to dry my hair and within seconds the nozzle fell off – it was only held together with sellotape. 
Turners, the restaurant which only opens on Saturday night btw, was a beautifully large room with ornate pillars, cornicing and glistening chandeliers. For want of a few dimmer switches the ambience was destroyed but staff was attentive and friendly and the food, much to my surprise, was really excellent.
Killashee House had two weddings on that particular weekend so unfortunately the grounds were closed off to us after dinner. Instead of the walk we expected we went to Jacks Bar which is large and open with an outdoor area for smokers. Unfortunately, the patio heaters were broken and smokers froze as did the women in their wedding outfits who just wanted a break from the celebrations. They were not fixed for the entire 3 days we spent there. Some people complained that they had no heat in their rooms and that they couldn’t sleep as it was bitterly cold. On the way back to our room we noticed various receptacles catching water beneath the radiators in the corridor. The carpets were wet underfoot.
Breakfast was held in the Turner room and that is when it comes into its own – it is spacious and flooded with light. Again, staff members were attentive and there was a wide choice of juices, cereals, fruit, pastries, yoghurt and a good number of cooked breakfasts. On the second evening we ate in Jacks and the food, although simpler fare, was equally good.
On the evening of our third day the heating stopped working in our room and we put a call in to reception. I decided to take a bath. Again the hot water was plentiful but when I went to use the shower head to rinse my hair, it sprung a leak and sprayed all over the place. My partner noticed a line of water appearing on the carpet in the bedroom, quickly followed and criss-crossed by another line. A pipe under the floor had obviously burst. I think we’d been beaten into submission by then and just decided to report it when we went down to dinner. Later that evening, staff told us that they had handled the leak in our bedroom – they’d put towels down on the floor to soak it up!! On the bright side, the heating was now working. In fairness, they offered to move us but stories we’d heard from other residents convinced us that it was best to stick with the devil we knew as we were leaving the following morning. That was a mistake. The heating would not turn off and in the morning the mirrors, windows and walls were all steamed up and I had a sore throat. 
Killashee House is beautiful but the extensions added to the original were over ambitious, built cheaply without due regard to the overall aesthetic and with a complete lack of thought with regard to convenience. I can safely say that I will never, ever, be staying there again.",2,2012,04,19
218,When it's good it's good!,"I have ate a couple of times in Jack's Bar and when it's nice it's very nice, but unfortunately some times it seems to be hit and miss. On a good day, the food is top class, but I have got cold mash and steak not cooked to request. The positives are though that when it is good, it's great value and a nice athmosphere also. 

Staff are also hit and miss and probably lacking a bit for a hotel of such prestige. Lovely venue, and have also stayed here once which was recommended experience. Ideal wedding location.",3,2012,04,17
218,Grand but dated.,"Two nights at the Killshee,The staff were pleasant and polite at all times,at this grand looking hotel.Jacks bar and diner is a great place to enjoy a good meal and drink or just sit and chat over a drink.The grounds are large and well kept good for a morning stroll.
The room we were given was large with a shower over the bath,however the shower screen did not fit leaving the floor wet and slipy.Overall the room was in need of some TLC but it was clean and there was a seperate bed besides the double, handy if a child was in the party.
I would stay again at this hotel.",4,2012,04,16
218,disappointing and slightly shabby 3 star,"Stayed here on a one night spa package with my fiancee - looked for a nice upper end spa hotel close to dublin and thought Killashee would fit the bill and we've had many of these types of breaks in 4 and 5 star hotels in Ireland.  

Killashee looks quite impressive from the outside, but when you scratch beneath the surface, this is a fairly shabby hotel in reality and is at best a 3 star and certainly one we will be avoiding in future.  We feel somewhat cheated having spent almost €400 to stay there, so it was an expensive lesson and there really needs to be a proper independent assessment and review of hotel like this so that other guests are not deceived by outward appearances of quality (like how has tripadvisor so many 5 star ratings for this place????).

Focusing on the room, like the hotel it was visually nice but in fact it was a cold, musty and damp room which we were astounded to find had no aircon and a old style box tv and no fridge/minibar - the room did have a heater which we think was operated centrally from reception somewhere as when we needed it to work it never did despite turning the dials and calling reception - this meant we had a very uncomfortable night sleeping in a cold and damp room with no heating.  There were a lot of other issues but this was the main one - we have never come across such a situation in a hotel room and it is outrageous that this place is marketed and sold as a luxury hotel.

Other issues:-

1. No bathrobes in room despite us being booking a spa package deal....called reception to get these, no luck, and then 30 mins later called housekeeping - no luck so gave up after a further 20 minutes and went traipsing across the car park in our swim gear as there is no internal access to the spa and pool areas...   

2.The whole hotel needs a lift as it did seem to be a bit run down and acesss to our rooms was a good distance from the main reception area.  

3.The leisure facilities are shared with normal gym members rather than guests of the hotel,not that we were snobs or anything but it doesn't really have a sense of luxury about it when you are pretty much going into the local gym and swimming pool...the whole leisure centre and pool area is really tired and overcrowded with body builders and the men's changing rooms could do with some air freshening and the whole place needs a good clean!...as I say, it is not really focused towards the guests of the hotel but regular punters instead",2,2012,04,14
218,Perfect everytime,"We've stayed in the Killashee three times, once for a wedding. The overnight packages were perfect. The rooms, meal and facilities are top rate. We've stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels and Killashee is the place we look forward to returning too. Never been dissappointed.",5,2012,04,13
218,Pretty on the outside but rooms need some love,I go here often for dinner as their food is wonderful and the hotel itself is near to race tracks I attend regularly. I love the hotels history and décor and was excited to be staying there but I felt let down by the rooms overall quality and feel it didn't reach the rest of the hotels standard,4,2012,04,12
218,Plenty of Olde World Charm here!,"Stayed here with my wife for 1 night break including dinner.
I had never stayed here before and decided only late in the week to find somewhere within a 2 hour drive for a quiet one night break, preferably somewhere with its own grounds where you could go for a walk without taking the car.  Kilashee house I just found by accident browsing the internet and thought it looked like a nice quiet place for a short w/e break.
I was not dissasppointed.
It is situated only about a mile or two from Naas on the Kilcullen road
Very impressive long driveway entrance, with plenty of parking available.
KIlashee house apparently used to be a convent and the bulding is very striking and impressive.
Reception area was spacious and seemed a bit dark but that only added to the old world charm of the place. I had requested a quiet room on a high floor with a view and that is exactly what I got. Even better the receptionist was a lovely lady called Louise who said rthat because we had specific room type request that the best thing was to upgrade us to a suite in the old part (i.e.quieter) of the house! The suite consisted of a living room and seperate bedroom and even though there was a wedding on we never heard a thing all night.
This was on the top floor and had a lovely view of the ornamental gardens. A lovely view to waken up to.
Both dinner and breakfast were excellent quality and the service could not be faulted. 
The hotel also has a leaisure centre and spa which we did not use as our visit was too short though perhaps a disadvantage was that there were in a seperate building from the hotel.
All in all I was very impressed with this hotel which because of its beautiful gardens and atmosphere understandably seems to be a popular place for weddings 
Had a very nice stay and would definately return. I would highly recommend it for a short break away from it all.",4,2012,04,08
218,A good getaway,"We've stayed here before & really enjoyed and were looking forward to it . When we got to our room it was freezing . Eventually they agreed to move us , after a lot of phone calls . We got a "" suite "" in the old building . My idea of a suite is a sitting room and a bedroom , this was a bedroom and a tiny bathroom , but it was warm and original . Food was very good in the restaurant. We got breakfast to the room and it was tasty and fresh . Has a lot of weddings and you can feel like a second class citizen if not part of the wedding . Leisure club is not attached and is accross a car park .",4,2012,04,08
218,"Wow, great relaxing midweek break.","Killashee is a great venue for a midweek chill out break, my wife & I went recently and had a really fine time. The hotel is classy and has such a warm feel to it. The staff are very professional & helpful and we enjoyed our evening meal & breakfast thoroughly. The Spa was brilliant . We left wishing we had booked two nights and not just one!",5,2012,04,05
218,"Excellant Hotel, staff & facilities....","I recently organised a night away for 4 of my friends along with their wife’s in Killashee....food in Jacks bar was out of this world, Leisure & Spa facilities were excellent and clean. Rooms were spacious and clean....

We will defiantly be back.....",5,2012,03,30

218,Great get away,We recently stayed at Killashee and had a great time. Spa and leisure facilities great to relax and unwind. Part of our package was an evening meal in Turners restaurant. Food of an excellent quality and service excellent. Then live entertainment in Jacks which created a great atmosphere. Room very spacious and staff very friendly and accommodating. Truly a great hotel to relax and unwind and very good value for money.,5,2012,03,01
218,Can I move in to the hotel????,"There isn't a thing that I could fault with our stay at Killashee house - the rooms were very comfortable, the bar is friendly and welcoming, the spa was absolutly divine (I especially liked the rasul!!) The food really is exceptional. The best part of all of our stay was the fact that the staff here are so helpful and friendly and immediatly put you at your ease. I love this hotel. I can't wait to come back!!",5,2012,03,01
218,Lovely atmosphere in a beautiful environment!,"This Hotel was booked for us as part of a Christmas pressie to the Races. We decided that we would take advantage of the 3nights for 2 offer and we were NOT disappointed! 
The room was very warm and relaxing, the staff friendly and the food fantastic. We had breakfast each morning of our stay and one evening meal - all meal menus had a great variety to choose from!
A walk around the grounds is a must and the tourist attractions will keep you busy.
We will definitly be back and look forward to it.",5,2012,02,28
218,Great atmosphere and value for money,"Have visited on a few occasions previously and now feel compelled to put pen to paper.

All the previous visits have been good but this last one was exceptional.

Had some business associates for a casual and informal lunch in Jack's and as usual, the service was great, the food outstanding and the portions extremely generous.

The overall ambiance is fantastic with the imposing structure, very tastefully decorated and superbly proportioned rooms, well appointed.

The fact that many locals frequent this location is testament to it's popularity and value for money.",4,2012,02,23
218,Top quality for budget price great I'll be back.,"Hotel room very spacious, warm but airy. Food was lovely with great choice. Staff very helpful & friendly. Lobby warm and cosy despite it large size. Afternoon tea was a light. Spa is fab - it's a must visit ideal location for that special weekend away. ",5,2012,02,20
218,Lovely staff and atmosphere,We have just celebrated my husbands birthday in killashee. Ourselves and our families booked in for the night and had a meal in a private room off the bar. From the atmosphere in the hotel to the staff everything was wonderful. The rooms are lovely with huge beds.I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel for any occasion.,5,2012,02,12
218,Best Ever,"Stayed at the Kilashee House Hotel for two nights. Just over half hour drive from Dublin airport and we arrived almost 3 hours before our booking in time. The staff where amazing! They checked to see if the room was ready and it was no problem. Room was smashing, large bed, large bathroom loads of towels and spotless. I could rant on all day about the hotel being such a beautiful place, old yet with all mod cons, without taking away from the old-worldy feel of the place. 

Food was top notch. We had the room service, which still delivered a full menu, which we have never found in any other hotel. 
The 2nd night we attended a birthday dinner. The staff ..... a team to watch! Never in your face but always there to keep the food and drink flowing with seemless effort. Seems to me and my wife, wether in your own bedroom or within the formal dinning areas, it would be hard to fault the food or service.

The spa is just a 20 sec walk across the car park, 2 sauna's, 2 steam rooms, swimming pool and full gym. All we needed was our shorts!

But folks, what made it a joy for us, the staff ! From arriving, to leaving, from the nice ladies on the reception, to the nice guy who attended with the room service, not forgetting the Spa staff. ALL lovely in every way, really friendly, helpful, nothing and I mean nothing seemed a problem, from providing towels in the spa, to providing a wet shaver to our room. ( I forgot mine). The manager needs to be very proud of all his staff, they made our weekend.

A great start to the the year, we shall return. Mac and Shaz.",5,2012,02,12
218,Perfect visit to Killashee,"Just back from a three night stay at Killashee - we had the most wonderful time. From the day before when we rang to confirm the booking with Michelle on Reception to the moment we left, it was just absolutely amazing. We had been upgraded to the most fabulous suite - the rooms were just huge and so comfortable. 

Killashee is a very special place for us because we got married there in October 2010 and this was our first visit back since then. We had been lucky enough to win the three night stay and dinner in Turners restaurant via a Facebook competition and the staff made us feel like millionaires the whole time we were there. Apart from breakfast every morning and the most fantastic food in Turners on the Friday night (the fillet of beef was to die for!), we also had lunch in Jack's bar. Every meal we had was wonderful.

We also used the spa which was wonderful - the facilities were so comfortable and the staff so friendly and professional. We also used the pool and lesiure centre and were really impressed with how clean and warm everything was.

We really didn't want to leave - we had been enjoying fantastic walks in the gardens on the crisp days and cozying up on the comfy sofa in our suite in the evenings. It really was the most wonderful mid-week break and we felt utterly spoilt.

Many thanks to everyone at Killashee for making our stay so fantastic - having had our wedding there well over a year ago, we still felt as if we were being treated like VIPs during our trip there this time.

Some specifics: the fresh bottle of water every day is a nice touch, as is the complimentary newspaper. The room service was fast and polite, the staff in the restaurant were lovely too and Ali in Jack's bar was particularly friendly. 

Overall, just the loveliest trip since our honeymoon!",5,2012,02,05
218,Perfect Escape,"We’ve stayed in Killashee House Hotel a number of times and as recently as last weekend, we keep going back as we’ve never been disappointed.  

The relaxing and enjoyable experience starts from the minute you check in with a warm welcome at reception right through to the cosy, intimate rooms and on into the beautiful restaurant with its delicious food.  

For us, Killashee House offers the opportunity to relax and unwind in a peaceful environment away from the troubles of everyday life and somewhere we know that nothing is beyond asking for.  I recommend it to people all the time, perfect for a couple break.",5,2012,01,25
218,Midweek break Killashee House Hotel,"Very comfortable hotel, excellent food, really nice leisure centre with very helpful staff. Really enjoyed our stay.",5,2012,01,21
218,over priced,"This hotel was way over priced,€160 for a couple for this price i was expecting a top hotel its fair to say that killashee house is more of a 3 star than a 4 star hotel.The bar is more of a restaurant than bar and can be hard to find seating as a lot of tables were reserved.
The rooms are a long way from the reception but  they offer to bring your bags up for you.
The room was very dated and there was a large number of stains on the carpet,old tv which did not work very well,bathroom floor was filthy as were the walls in the bathroom,bed was OK, wallpaper was peeling from parts of the walls over all the rooms were very very dated and were no where near worth the €160.I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotel for less money and had way better accommodation and facility's.On the plus side i found the staff good especially in jacks bar and the food was good,we were there for a wedding and it went very well and was run very well.I think if they sorted out the rooms and had a nice bar it would have been ok but still not worth €160.",3,2012,01,15
218,Perfect Wedding location,"I attended my partners brothers wedding here last May. From the minute we arrived till the minute we left we were treated like royalty. The service was incredible from both the management to floor staff.The decor is fantastic and very in keeping with the structure of the building as a whole.

The meal was lovely and beef was tender. The breakfast buffet was constantly full so no waiting on the food to arrive from the kitchen.

The room was clean and there was no forgotten rubbish not taken from the room. The only downside is that you have to get two lifts to it and the walk is long.

The wedding party had both the ceremony and the function in the hotel and were so happy about how well their guests were treated and how well the whole event went.",4,2012,01,10
218,Terrible - STAY AWAY,"HORRIBLE STAFF & OVER PRICED. Our friends wedding was at this hotel. We paid €150 per night. Room was poor for this money. Old TV, musty, cold - very few blankets. During the wedding 1 of the wedding party got a 3rd room key from reception & threw cake in the room (while my girlfriend & I was asleep). I informed the reception the next morning & gave them the 3rd key. At check out we got charged €75 for damages - & they told us during our discussions that there was ""no 3rd room key given out"" - I argued that the locks were reset on our room, we got our 2 room keys reissued which they did for security reasons. The staff were horrible & threatened that if we didn't pay it would be put on the room of the bride & groom!!!!!!! What a dirty trick. They charged us for washing the bed spreads & informed us that they do not wash the bed spreads after each visitor & the charge was for bringing someone out on new years day - rubbish! Bar staff are slow & rude - sending SMS instead of serving. Staff behind reception are the worst I have ever encountered - happy to take the thousands of euro from the wedding but when they give out a spare room key & your room gets ruined, they charge you €75 on top of the overpriced room. PLEASE STAY AWAY from this hotel. They RUINED the memory of my best friends wedding. I do not like being called a liar by one of the rudest managers I have ever met.",1,2012,01,09
218,Great Night Away,We stayed here for one night on a deal that included dinner and breakfast. The grounds are lovely and the hotel is very nice. The staff were great and dinner in the Turners Restaurant was fantastic. The rooms and corridors could do with a bit of freshening up but that is a minor thing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a quick getaway.,4,2012,01,04
218,Very Disappointing,"Stayed here in NOvember 2011. During the booking process the sales assistant was extremely helpful and was keen to ensure that our stay was a memorable one. unfortunately the stay was memorable for all the wrong reasons. The helpful sales assistant then left the hotel to be replaced by an extremely rude person who did not make me feel very welcome at all. The staff and the hotel we rude and our room smelled strongly of damp. We were also woken up several times during the night with noise and alarms going off. The supplies in the room we mean, and we were only left one replacement towel for the second nights stay. the food was very nice, but on both nights had to be sent back as it was cold. But the most disappointing and distressing part of the stay was that there was a MOUSE running freely around the restaurant on during our meal. When we expressed our disgust we were told by the restaurant manager to 'Have another glass of wine and you won't notice it' ?!!
Will never ever visit again and would certainly not recommend.",1,2012,01,03
218,BLISS!,"First off, this hotel was AMAZING!!! It has an old style feel which I think has been preserved quite well but a nice modern touch to bring that nice homey feeling.  We checked in around 9pm on our first night and went for food in the bar…. Food is first class and their chips and to die for! They really are just fantastic and the service in there was A1. We booked a Junior Suits (when I say we I mean my wonderful boyfriend) with a 4 poster bed, a jacuzzi style bath and a nice couch in front of the bed to relax and watch tv. I do have one item that I would like to point out as a downfall, the TV in the bedroom was tiny, when I say tiny I mean I was struggling to see what was on the TV when I sat on the couch as it is so far away, and to change the channel or volume you have to get up and walk towards the TV in order to do so, that would be my only downfall really, but other than that I can honestly say it was probably the most relaxing break away I’ve had yet. And ladies its only a 15 minute drive from Kildare Village!!!",5,2011,12,09
218,"Good Venue for Weddings, Beautiful Building","We didn't get to stay here overnight, but we just attended for a wedding. The building is gorgeous and very well restored. It seemed to be frequented by many locals, as the bar and restaurant were filled up.

The food for the wedding was fine and I was lucky because I had an amazing wild green salad (the regular salad had meat), so that was delicious. The staff were friendly too.",4,2011,11,30
218,Lovely Olde World Hotel,"Stayed in the Kilashee House Hotel while at a conference in Naas.  Looks fabulous coming up the drive. Beautiful Grounds.  Reception, decor and spacious surrounds are fabulous. Only downside is the long walk to the bedrooms, which involved long corridors and two lifts (one up and one down!) the bedroom was very olde world, the bed was huge.  Lovely big bathroom. 
Room was really warm and comfortable.  Breakfast was great. Dining room again luxurious. Staff did good job, but not very friendly. I attended a banquet meal on the night, food was great and we were in a private dining room with a lovely Christmas Tree. Would highly recommend the hotel and will definitely stay there again.",4,2011,11,29
218,Disappointing,"Stayed here as part of a spa package. The hotel looks impressive but that's where it ends. My room was old, cold and miles away from reception. The staff were rude. The food was actually nice but we were rushed out of the restaurant after dinner. The spa was fine but nothing to write home about. Very disappointing. Will not be back.",1,2011,11,29
218,Super Food,"I recently met some friends in the bar in the Killashee, we were there at lunchtime and the bar was busy with eaters.
I ordered soup to start and then a club sandwich.
The soup was fantastic you just knew it had been made on the premises, not the usual gloop you get where all the cook does is re-heat a bucket of Pallas Food muck.
My Club Sandwich was sublime, the way proper Club Sandwiches should be complete with fried egg, I also had the chunky chips on the side, wow wow wow, I'd travel there just for them.
Because the rest was so good I ordered a desert, I ordered the Plum knickerbocker glory, to say it was a taste experience was an understatement.
If I'm within 20 kilometres of the Killashee I'll be going there for the food.",5,2011,11,20
218,Disappointing:,"I was disappointed when I went to Kilashee for the October Bank holiday weekend. The hotel is in a lovely setting but it needs to be updated. We asked for a quiet room which we got and had a lovely big ensuite, again broken window in the bathroom and the bed was very uncomfortable, just need to be updated. Restaurant was closed on the Bank Holiday Sunday night so we ate in Jacks Bar, the food was pre cooked and the food was out with in minutes of ordering it, even the well done steak!!!!!!!! Staff in Reception were lovely and couldn't do enough but the staff in the bar and at breakfast were just there to do a job, not all but majority.",3,2011,11,12
218,Lovely,"Only fault is the terrible phone network.
Beautiful rooms. They let me check in early which made it extra nice. Great stay. Fantastic wedding set up. ",5,2011,11,12
218,First Class Service,"We recently stayed in Killashee and i was most impressed by the staff. The receptionist upgraded us when she found out that I was 7 months pregnant and then we were upgraded again when we booked Spa treatments prior to our arrival. So we ended up in the second best room in the hotel, next to the Bridal Suite. The suite had a four poster bed and I really felt like the Lady of the Manor!!!! The hotel is old style and the rooms reflect this but I felt that it was all very grand - the bathroom was huge!!! The spa treatments were good but I did feel that the spa was not quite to the standard of others I have been in and the walk back across the carpark to the hotel is very offputting as there is a derelict portacabin type unit in view which is not what you expect. The food and the service in the bar is excellent. I love the bar in this hotel and it is probably the reason why I keep coming back!!!!! The breakfast is amazing but you need to be very hungry to order the omelette as it is massive!!!! Again the staff are very attentive. The layout of the hotel is a tad confusing but i think this adds to the old world charm. All in all, we were very happy with our stay and we will be back. The leisure centre is excellent with the best pool I have ever been in.",5,2011,11,06
218,"Great value, a good standard but in danger of becoming dated","I stayed here unexpectedly due to bad weather stopping my journey.  The evening food was superb, the rooms are of a good standard, although the lack of wifi in the rooms is a pain.  Breakfast was ok, but let down by bad coffee.  The overall value of my three nights was excellent.",4,2011,10,29
218,Nice but not as fantastic as hoped !,"My sister & I stayed here on the over night Spa package. On arrival the hotel itself is very stylish, the reception area & bar are really nice. Our room (a deluxe room) had 2 large double beds with large stand alone furniture and was “olde worlde”, but on the plus size the room was large and half of the view was of the garden! The other half was of the not so nice back of the restaurant. Our bathroom was unfortunately very much in need of refurbishment, there was a great deal of silicone holding it together! The towels were not only very sparse (2 small ones & 1 hand towel) but of a very inferior quality and were almost as old as the hotel itself.

The spa is in a separate building to the hotel. The treatments were good, but I did feel mine was a bit rushed. The Spa was very busy the day we were there resulting in the “Juice Bar” running out of juice and glasses. Not a big issue just something that needed a bit more attention from the staff. The spa itself is more like a beauty parlour than a spa. The facilities available other than the treatment rooms include a swimming pool, a jacuzzi, a steam room & sauna which are really part of the hotel leisure centre and in no way feels like part of a spa. The spa as mentioned is in a separate building which is not the end of the world but it certainly takes from the treatments when you have to redress and cross a car park in the drizzling rain as we had to do. And when doing so it’s hard not to notice the mess of the buildings at the back of the hotel.

We ate in the restaurant (Fine dining) and that was indeed fantastic. Breakfast was also served in this room and had a high standard of cold buffet fare and with cooked breakfast orders taken and served to your table. 

All throughout the staff were very nice, polite, and helpful. Because of its age the hotel is a bit of a rabbits warren regarding finding your room, with very little signage, unfortunately some wedding guests found it particularly hard to find their rooms around 4am, which in fairness I can understand as we managed to get lost at 3pm whilst sober! 

I would recommend this hotel as a break away hotel for good food and ambience but I wouldn’t go there just for a spa break, it doesn’t really meet expectations.",4,2011,10,23
218,"Excellent service, tranquill hotel. Why we loved this hotel....","Myself and my husband have travelled and stayed in many hotels and I felt compelled to tell my story about Killashee House. From the moment we drove down the long sweeping avenue where we were greeted by the fasacde of an beautiful Jacobean sty;e county manor, we knew we were in the right place for us. The service was out of this world and it was lovely to see that management took a keen interest their staff. I absoutly have to mention Jacks bar. It where old mets new, tranquil and stylish and i havent even mentioned the food, try the thai green curry and you wont be disappointed. All in all this hotel gets its top score for its excellent service, wonderfull food and such a calm and peaceful place to spend a weekend. Remember to check out the spa.",5,2011,10,20
218,"Relaxing, peaceful hotel",We stayed in the Killashee hotel during the ploughing championship. It was a really peaceful & relaxing few days/nights. The food was beautiful & the staff very friendly especially in the bar where we dined both nights. We could not find one fault with this hotel. We booked our room months earlier & were very impressed with our accommodation. Definately will go back..,5,2011,10,17
218,Hard to fault,"I spent 4 nights here midweek with a conference group and thoroughly enjoyed it.
This is a massive rambling hotel with a luxury country house feel. My room was very big, well-maintained, elegant, clean and very quiet. There are lots of spacious public areas in the hotel with deep sofas to relax in (and free wifi). Beautiful gardens are all around.
The breakfast is very good - I liked the fresh fruit salad and the pancakes. Meals in the bar were also of a good standard and the special dinner organised for our group was delicious. Staff were without exception friendly and polite.
Hard to fault this hotel at all.",4,2011,10,08
218,A really relaxing Anniversary few days!,"The hotel was easy to find and looks amazing as you drive up.  Lots of history and the staff are very friendly.  Very old world with lots of drapes and furniture.  Jacks bar is very dark but the food was good.  The room was very grand, we stayed in a suit with a 4 poster bed. Very clean.  An enjoyable few days. And it has free Wifi.",4,2011,10,05
218,A very special place,"From the minute we arrived, we knew we were in a very special place! My husband attended a 5-day conference at the hotel.   We could not have asked for more: friendly staff, very good meals, comfortable room, attractive public spaces, beautiful gardens and grounds, and a historic setting that’s tucked into the lovely County Kildare countryside and yet close to Dublin and other wonderful day-trip locations.   We were delighted at every turn.  Killashee House Hotel is a haven for those who appreciate the services of a modern business hotel but long for the gracious attentiveness and cozy comforts of a top-rated B&B.",4,2011,10,02
218,Amazing Hotel!,"Myself and my hubby had our Wedding here in July. Everything was excellent, service, food, room, attention to detail- just excellent. Alot of our guests came from England and were delighted with their holiday In Ireland. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff, Lisa and Caroline, the male banqueting Manager-Paul? Sorry not sure!! Ronan who lugged our luggage from A to B and all the friendly staff on reception and through out the hotel. The hotel built a new wheelchair ramp to the dance floor of the function room for us- as they knew I had two young guests in wheel chairs. How thoughtful is that? I could go on and on saying good things!
My Husband and I have both worked in 4 and 5 star Hotels in Ireland and England so we are well up on the 'Hotel Scene'! It is hard work, so believe me when I say the staff @ Killashee are on the ball. There was no question we had for them that went unanswered and no request that was not met.
Please take the bad reviews with a pinch of salt ,I personally feel they are not a true reflection of this wonderful place. The hotel is not that big and I found all the rooms were well sign posted so I do not understand the 'maze of corridors' comments, nor do i see what the big deal is that the Leisure centre and spa are a seperate building to the hotel. 
Thank you so much Dee Nix and the entire staff @ Kilashee House Hotel.",5,2011,09,27
218,Lovely room and gorgeous surroundings. Disappointing restaurant.,"I stayed here last week for my boyfriend's birthday. It was a treat for his birthday and as the price was 150euro a night (even though it was midweek) I expected excellent service. The hotel staff were excellent and the room was large and comfortable. However, the service provided at dinner in Jack's Bar was very disappointing. Twice I had to get out of my seat and ask a member of staff could we order. We got our main course and it was nice but when we asked for the dessert menus we waited a further 20 minutes before I got up again and had to ask someone to take our order. This is completely unacceptable in a 4 star hotel. It gave a very bad impression with us and we certainly would not return for food again. The hotel itself is lovely but unfortunately this bad experience has put us off returning.",3,2011,09,26
218,A Friendly spot,"I stayed in Killashee at the beginning of September for my Birthday what a treat. My husband booked it for me as my present it was just fab. We went down on Friday it took 50 mins from Dublin but it felt we were deep in the country. When we arrived it was very busy and we had to park in car park a little away from the hotel when we got to reception were met by a friendly porter who took our bags. We went to check in while he waited for us the reception was fabulous apparently it has been recently refurbished the receptionist was really friendly and gave us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite as a special treat for my birthday.

The Suite was fab and had a jacuzzi bath in it so relaxing and a four poster bed!!

We had a pizza in Jacks the 1st night and followed by The Sticky Toffee Pudding it is a must!

Saturday I had a facial in the Spa while my husband watched the rugby in Jacks

Breakfast was lovely I kept it healthy with fresh fruit but the other half had the Full Irish and cleaned the plate. We went to Kildare Village in afternoon with our discount card and I got myself some 7 Jeans big sale on we went back to hotel via Newbridge Silver and treated ourselves to afternoon Tea well worth a visit and the stle icon museums is a must.

That night we dined in Turners FABULOUS food and service top class and the Restaurant Manager came out with a special birthday plate at the end of the night it was a perfect end to a perfect meal.

All I can say is well worth a visit, yes it was a busy weekend with 2 weddings on each night but to be honest you would not have noticed there was space for everyone.

Will defo go back for a break roll on Christmas !!!!!!!!!!!",5,2011,09,20
218,"As i said to the manager "" i wouldnt return if she paid me""","We stayed in this hotel in July of 2011. We had booked 4 double rooms as all the family went away for a break. 
As we drove up the long driveway i was so excited, it looked amaizing. With beautiful gardens and even a helipad. But i couldnt of been more wrong.
The first night we stayed my husband and I were about to go to sleep when suddenly this extremely loud band started up. we couldnt figure out where it was coming from until i nearly hung myself out of the window to see that they had placed us in rooms which was right next to the wedding reception hall. and when i say right next to it i mean 4 windows away from it. all ngiht they had the windows and doors opened and we could hear word for word of every song. There is no air conditioning in the rooms so it was a catch 22 - have the windows open for air but not sleep becuase of the noise, or close the windows and nearly suffocate. 
the next morning each one of us complained about them putting us so close to the venue and they said that there was nothing they could do about it as it was fully. booked.
Every single night was the same after that as a wedding was on each night. but to top everything all off was the last night. other people we knew were also staying in the hotel and i had heard reports that there had been mice in there rooms but i though nothing of it as they were on the bottom floor. but to my horror i woke at 5am to a mouse in the room. it was disgusting he had been everywhere. all over us and the floor leaving droppings everywhere. im surprised any staff member had heads left after i was finished with them. upon leaving all we got for the sound disturabance was 25.00 total and as for the mouse which she claimed was a woodland shrew from the neighbouring construction, i recieved 140.00 in return as i refused to come back even if she paid for it. 
all i can say is listen to the negative reviews. the hotel is the worst i have ever ever stayed in. food horrible, staff horrible, rooms horrible everything horrible.",1,2011,09,15
218,What a hotel,"I stayed here for my brothers wedding, all i can say is what a hotel, absolutely amazing grounds for photos, the food and the rooms were oustanding.",5,2011,09,12
218,Not overly impressed,"Stayed here for 2 nights in August.  Whilst there, there was a wedding on the Friday night, a wedding and an 80th birthday party on the Saturday night, a post-wedding dinner on the Saturday night and a christening party on Saturday.  Whilst this is nothing unusual for a hotel (August being a popular month for weddings), it meant that throughout our stay, the place was overrun with wedding/party guests....so much so that we could not get seating at all in Jacks Bar on Saturday eve/night when we wanted to have a drink and then dinner.  We ended up having to drive into Naas where we had dinner in the Osprey hotel.  On both Friday and Saturday night, countless tables in Jacks were ""reserved"" and so it took some to get somewhere to sit and eat on Friday night.  The bar is also so loud with families and groups having pre function drinks that it’s not the kind of bar you stay in to have a few drinks after dinner.  It felt more like a pub trying to be a restaurant and not really designed for those who want to kick back with a few drinks.  We just gave up on Saturday.  I am not sure why they closed the Nuns Bar in the basement.  They simply can't cater for the numbers with the facilities they have – particularly the leisure traveller who is not part of a wedding or other group function.  I mentioned this at checkout and the receptionist said she would bring it to management’s attention.  Getting to our room was a bit of a drama; having to go up stairs and down lifts - but not before we had to cross the residents bar on the upper level where on both Friday and Saturday, wedding parties were having their pre-dinner drinks.  Spa is accessed through the car park. Pool is nothing to write home about and I would liken it to a leisure centre.  My overall feeling from the weekend is that if you are not part of a wedding group or pre-booked party, then you pretty much need to fend for yourself - even of that means leaving the hotel to get dinner elsewhere!",2,2011,09,12
218,Beautiful Hotel - Will be back,"Just spent one night here at the weekend with a couple of the girls. Was expecting a slightly more old fashioned hotel , but this hotel is beautiful. Its huge. All the open areas are so big and luxurious. Cosy lighting. Would love to stay at Christmas time I would imagine the atmosphere would be fab. . We had a one night dinner b/b package - in a triple room . Worked out at 90 euros pp. Such good value. Food in restaurant was top class and all the staff on both reception and bar/restaurant were really great. Hotel has a lovely relaxing atmosphere . We chilled out in the bar in the afternoon had a glass of wine after our morning of shopping in Newbridge (Kildare village probably even closer). The bar has a separate menu which a lot of people were availing of and it looked good. Bar is modern and relaxing at the same time.  . We didnt use the spa or leisure centre so cannot comment. . Breakfast was served in the restaurant . Cereals, pastries, fruit or you can order a fresh hot breakfast , fry, omelletes, smoked salmon with eggs... cooked to order which was great.  Will definately be back to this hotel.",5,2011,09,12
218,WORST SPA in Ireland !!!!,"I am a big of spa's and have been to so many all over Ireland but this is possible one of the worst experiences I have had.  The treatments were just average facilities arein need of updating and changing facilities(no toilet roll in the lady's bathroom) had to ask for water, however I will note the therapists were nice and friendly. Part of our day spa experience was the oriental spa ritual and use of the leisure facilities. At no point were we ever told were the the jacuzzi was or anything but managed to find it for myself when the treatments were finished! Jacuzzi was out of order and on entry of the steam room the smell of dirty feet was enough for me.... I made it a point at reception to note this but they were extremely rude and didn't care attitude basically saying it wasn't der problem and full price of the treatment was payable and no apologies were given at any point at least. Never again SUCH A DISSAPOINTING EXPERIENCE and would not recommend this spa to anyone. More like an average beauty salon with awful facilities .....",1,2011,09,11
218,AVOID THIS HOTEL!!! OVERPRICED AND IN NEED OF TLC!!,"After checking out the website and the reviews on trip advisor i was very excited about staying here however once we arrived we were seriously let down!!!!  I cannot understand how this place has received good reviews?!?

-We booked a junior suite.....do not be fooled this a quite a large room NOT a suite and a very small and dated bathroom!! Jacuzzi dates from the 1970s!! bathroom was well below standard.
-Breakfast staff were THE WORST i have ever experienced, i had to ask 3 times for our tea, the waitress just looked at us blankly then wandered off and didnt return, so called another and then another...this happened with our hot breakfast as well.   I wouldnt expect that level of service in a roadside motel so to get it here was disgusting - this happened on both mornings.
-the pool was terrible! i have never stayed anywhere where you have to leave the hotel to walk across a carpark to get to it...ridiculous.  And not only that the surrounding area is such a mess, porta cabins strewn around like a building site - this was the view from our ""suite""
The pool itself was no better than that of a community centre - when we got there we didnt even bother to get in.
-Spa was lovely, staff here were great, i really enjoyed my treatments!
-The only thing about this hotel i could possibly reccommend is the restaurant, we had a beautiful meal, surprisingly the waitress was brilliant.  Also the bar had a great atmosphere.

Needs some TLC and new staff!!!!!
All in all DO NOT BOTHER, COMPLETELY OVERPRICED.  Stay elsewhere.",1,2011,09,11
218,Ok For a The night,"Stayed the end of July as we were attending a wedding. We stayed in the Beatrix room in the actual house. No lift and had to drag the luggage up the stairs. We were offered some help though. Room was Ok, double bed, wardrobe, dressing table, safe etc. The room had no net curtains or voiles so when getting changed anymoe walking to the front of the building could see into the room. The bathroom was tiny and only had a shower and no bath, which after a night of danicng when you want to soak your feet is not ideal.
Wedding was fabulous, Had a great time, food was fantastic and staff and management were very attentive- My favourite wedding location yet. Breakfast was great, big selection of food, no complimentary newspaper :( Had to buy one at reception, a little unusual.
I would go back for a spa weekend, hotel has beautiful grounds and well worth another visit.",4,2011,08,31
218,"Loved it, did not want to leave","Arrived around 2 o clock fri afternoon and although checkin is not until 3 the friendly receptionist proceeded to check us in to a lovely suite. We were offered a porter and although we declined a nice young guy still helped us with our bags. It was a short journey to the room but on the way we were givin a run down of the facilities and about how the hotel used to be a school.
That evening we decided that we would eat in jacks bar we booked for 7 o clock and when we arrived they had our table waiting, as it was a weekend away we were in no rush so we decided to have some cocktails before our meal, Bahamas Puple was a steal. The menu in jacks really caters for everyones taste from pizzas to steaks and my favourite the fish and chips. All topped of by some lovely traditional music.
Saturday mornng we decided to be a bit lazy so we had room service with such an extensive menu we found it hard to chose so just went with the full irsh which was just perfect.
we decided that we would do some shopping and made our way to kiladre village which was about 25mins from hotel we received a discount card from reception which gave us 10% off which was really nice.
Back to the hotel then for there traditional afternoon tea a lovely treat before dinner. we booked into turners restaurant on saturday evening. We arrived about 8 and were givin a lovely table by the window it felt very romantic. Plenty of wines to chose from and the wine waiter was very helpful and had a great knowledge of the wnes. Our starters came out on slates which looking really cool and tasted just as good as they looked. The meal was superb and after we made our way back to jacks bar to relax and listen to the guitarist for the evening. We did not even have to go to the bar as there were staff do drinks all night.
Sunday morning we decided to come down for breakfast which was very nice. Extensive buffet and cooked breakfast fresh from the kitchen.
After Checkout we were offered use of the pool and gym which we decided to take advantage of as we had not had a chance yet.
Best weekend in years. Did not have to think about anything all weekend. Was able to relax and  enjoy everthing will be back very soon.
Thanks to everyone",5,2011,08,29
218,"Very Nice, would return.","Stayed here for weekend with husband and baby. Upgraded to Broadfield Suite on arrival. Only thing is, it's upstairs in the old part of the building, so the buggy wasn't going to make it!! Didn't bother us and staff were very helpful suggesting we keep the buggy behind the reception desk and it was never a hassle to get it.
Ate in Jacks Bar and Turners restaurant. Had good experiences both times. Breakfast lovely too. Staff very friendly. The ladies behind the desk at the leisure centre were particulary nice to us, it was our little one first time in the pool.
The only negitives are, you have to go outside to go the leisure centre, I know there is nothing the hotel can do about that. Was just a bit weary with bringing baby back out into the cold air after pool. And also the maintenance on the grounds could be a little better.
But on the whole, would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",4,2011,08,28
218,a little bit of old world,This is a beautiful old hotel with very friendly staff who will do anything to make your stay as enjoyable as possible . They also have a beautiful spa and pool and the rooms are very big and comfortable. It is real old world which I like .I would recommend this for tourist and natives alike .,5,2011,08,28
218,we will never be back,"i only got back this morning from a weekend in the hotel from the minute we went in the door we got a snotty receptionist,and things just got worse from there,we were giving our room which was in the 100.s you had to go down 3 floors to get to it across hall ways and through reception room,room was spotlessly clean but drab and could do with modernising or have it really old to keep in the era of the hotel.w asked could we change our meal to saturday night rather than fri night as we were pushed for time as we arrived late,and we were told it was impossible as the restaurant was fully booked with children we were told the latest you could have your meal was 7,so we had it friday night,on saturday night we passed the hotel at 7.30 and there was hardly any body in the restaurant,they could of easily changing us over for the sat night,also for the rugby lots of tables were reserved,we had asked what we think was the manager of that section could we have a seat and we were told point blankly no,and were we eating,we were going to but decided against it after the way we were treated,i would like to no how you can reserve so many tables on such a busy sat afternoon with such a big rugby game,we ended going elsewere outside the hotel and got a lovely meal,most of the staff are ignorant and rude and need to be thought manners they have no customer relations skills,we have been to many hotels and we are not the kind of people to complain but we could not wait to get out of this hotel and i did read trip advisor before we wet and i should of taking it in to account what other travellers said,also food was not up to standard ask for well done beef,and i got well done on the out side red on the inside,but it did not go to waste as i fed the starving kittens around the hotel,would it not be in the best interest of the hotel to feed the poor little things and with that they would keep vermon out!! i was so dissapointed my partner and i and kids only get to see each other every 8 weeks due to work commitments and we were so upset we chose this hotel it ruined it for us,so no we will never ever return here....",2,2011,08,28
218,Great weekend.,"Just had a wonderful weekend in Killashee.

The room was so big and spacious.

Dinner in Turners restaurant was amazing and the waitress was so attentive, she really went out of her way to make sure we had a good time",5,2011,08,22
218,Killashee Wedding Venue... NO THANKS!,"Myself and my Fiancé stayed in killashee in mid July, the booking was made by my mother as an engagement present and the general idea was to stay and get a feel for the place as a possible venue to have a wedding reception, we had read a few dubious reviews about Killashee but as the grounds were so stunning against our better judgement we decided to make the trip from Castleknock out to kildare, from the moment we stepped into the ""Hotel"" there was a wedding coming in and we were cast aside at check in and made feel like a nuisance if that wasn't bad enough there was no available porter on hand to help with luggage, when we asked for some help we were told to wait until a porter was available as they could not contact one??? for a busy hotel there were no staff there or at least none that wanted to assist us. When we finally got to our room a mile away for reception via complicated route we found ourselves less than impressed with the room decor, ripped wallpaper isn't exactly 4 star? after lunch in ""Jacks"" Bar we gave up all hope, the bar itself was the equivalent of a bad nightclub tasteless is the word that springs to mind. As far as the service goes the food was ok we had the smoked salmon and fish and chips (chips were hard and too salty) and the staff seemed unhappy to be there and the overall atmosphere of the hotel was a negative one.. needless to say we wont be returning or reccommending this venue to wedding couples or any other couples in fact!",1,2011,08,20
218,One night not enough,"Booked a dinner Bed & Breakfast special offer and the in general we were extremely happy. The room was lovely and very clean. We tried the afternoon tea and that was excellent. Dinner was also really good. Breakfast the next morning was also fine. My only gripe would be the staff. While they were very efficient, they just were not one bit friendly. It is a pity as it would have scored 100% otherwise.",4,2011,08,20
218,Beautiful Hotel for a quiet refreshing break,"Quiet Old Style Country House tastefully converted into modern hotel, with modern leisure centre, beautiful gardens and grounds in quiet location.",5,2011,08,19
218,We cant wait to return,"Myself and my boyfriend booked a long needed break away from reality. From the moment we drove up the avenue we knew that we had made the right choice on our destination. We were greated in reception by super friendly staff and they even offered to get someone to help us with our bags! 
We had dinner in the restaurant the first night of our stay and the only words that I can describe is ""FINE DINING"" at its best. Well worth paying the extra few euro for this experience. The following day we had planned to go into naas town, only I had misplaced my handbag that morning and the manager so very kindly helped me search the entire hotel untill it was found - under the breakfast table. We eventually got into Naas and had a lovely relaxing day browsing the shops. 

I really cant wait to go back to Killashee and maybe next time we might even bring some of the extended family. Thanks to all the team @ Killashee.",5,2011,08,16
218,""" fab place & we will be back""","We spent  two ngts in the killashee hotel overall we had a fantastic time enjoyed a lovely wedding reception the first day we arrived the staff throughout the hotel were both very helpful and friendly ,we ate in the restaurant food was excellent i would def recommend the hotel and return some time",4,2011,08,16
218,Fabulous Surroundings & Great Food,"I stayed in this hotel last weekend for a friends wedding. The hotel was great for a wedding, fabulous outdoor space and the building is beautiful. The rooms were comfortable and although I had been tipped off that the food was good, it was indeed excellent. I'd recommend it for the food alone! If I need a hotel int he rea again I will choose this hotel.",4,2011,08,16
218,Romantic surprise,"My boyfried surpised me with 2 nights away for my birthday, have always gone onto trip advisor to read up on places before I arrive and had read most of review good and bad, did not know what to expect after reading. On arrival I have to say the driveway, the staircase and the old part to the hotel I found were amazing, we had a porter offer to show us to our room which we found so helpful, there was a wedding and our first though was this is gonna be loud, the following morning we were surprised we had not been disturbed, we had afternoon tea instead of lunch- amazed again!!! after a wander around the gardens we had dinner in Jacks as we did not want the big 4 course dinner, it was a busy night and we though we would have a wait for a table- the guy in charge seated us at the bar to wait on a table and explained it would not be long- we chatted to the bar girl who made me a fantastic cocktail that was not on the list, before we finished our drinks we had a table, the fillet steak was the best I have ever tasted and perfectly cooked and our waitress was fantastic she spotted us finishing our wine early in the meal and we didn't have to wait for a second bottle- my kind of service. the music was good and even though they were busy we didn't have to wait for anything. All I want now is another surprise wkend away - hopefully with a ring because I know where I want to get married.",4,2011,08,12
218,Would not go back,"Just came back from a weekend here. Satff at reception were friendly and helpfull. We got upgraded to a sweet but if it was a sweet I am glad we were upgraded as I would have hated to see what the other rooms were like. Hotel itself was old and filthy. Its in major need of an upgrade. Went out back with a pint to enjoy the sunshine and it was worse then a nightclub. Smoke butts everywhere and just pieces of rubbish it clearly hadnt been cleaned from the night before and had to move back inside. Food in Jacks was good to their credit. I did enjoy the meal. Although the bar staff really didnt know what they were doing. 
Went to the spa to see if we could use the hydro pool and was told it hadnt been in use for ages even though it is still advertised on the website.
The grounds directly infront and back of hotel are well kept but if you walk five hundred yard past its not kept at all.
Overall its is not a four star hotel and if there was a review done today it would have to be downgraded. For the price there are alot better places to go. Would not recommend it for couples....",2,2011,08,08
218,"Great food, nice atmosphere, needs an architect and decorator","We went to the hotel as friends of ours were having their wedding reception there.  On first appearance this is a fantastic hotel.  Plenty of parking and lovely grounds.
The wedding meal was fantastic probably the best I have ever had at a wedding including my own ; (.
All the staff at the hotel seemed very professional and all food and drink was excellent.

Unfortunately the hotel was let down by the accommodation.
The hotel layout is terrible we had to go up lifts and then down lifts round corners up stairs.  Internal sat nav in the hotel would be useful.  They also have plenty of rooms with no lift access according to other guests.
The rooms themselves were tired and in need of decoration.  There were stains on the blankets on the bed and on the walls.  Not what you would expect for the hefty room price.
Its a shame really but because of the accommodation I just could not recommend it to friends.",3,2011,07,29
218,"Only ok, I won't be back.","I'd heard so many good things about Killashee house, but it is living on its reputation from times past. The old part of the hotel is nice and quite elegant. The ""newer"" part is a little run down. Our room, which was in the newer wing, was difficult to get to. We had to go up stairs, walk through corridors and then back down stairs and along more corridors. The room itself was big, but it was dark and dingy. The main light was a fluorescent light, which was awful. And the walls had dents and holes in the plaster board. The whole place needs a bit of a face lift.
The staff were nice and friendly, although the service in Jacks restaurant was laughable. We weren't kept waiting, it was just fawlty towers. We found it amusing. I've heard good things about Turners restaurant, although I'd heard good things about the whole hotels as well. 
Over all it was fine, but there are much nicer places for the money.",2,2011,07,29
218,Had a great time here at Oxegen,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for the Oxegen festival, the hotel was lovely and a real treat away from the crowds at the festival.  The hotel grounds were wonderful, the staff very friendly and helpful, the room clean and very classically designed.  Great breakfast, table service and excellent selection of cooked breakfasts.  The hotel didn't mind us walking around in our wellies either.  Very handy for the festival, short taxi ride into Naas and then on to the free buses to the gig.  I'm too old to rough it in a tent :-)

Overall, very lovely and would strongly recommend it.  Bar nice and not too pricey.  The layout is a little odd though - perhaps due to the origin of the hotel as a school.  There seems to be several ""wings"" to the hotel.  You can go upstairs to the 2nd floor, walk along a corridor and find yourself having to take a lift down to the 2nd floor!  Odd, you've actually walked to the 3rd floor of another wing.  That's a little inconsistent and could confuse residents.  

OK, that's being a little fussy - overall, great place to stay and I would go back without hesitation!!",5,2011,07,19
218,Fantastic 3 day break,"We stayed in the old part of the hotel in a suite overlooking the garden.No lifts but the three flights of stairs was well worth it.Ate in Turners restaurant on two nights,great food and service,Jacks menu on the Sunday night was a bit disappointing.The staff are very friendly and cannot do enough for you.We would highly recommend this Hotel and are already planning our next visit.The only down side was the bed in our suite it was a bit low and hard for us.",4,2011,07,19
218,Dissapointed,"Hotel was nice in general, but the service was appalling. My wife and I went to Jacks bar to eat on our first night, and had to ask a numerous times for a menu,eventually a bar tender gave us two and then we waited twenty minutes for someone to take our order. The waitress took the order, but about fifteen minutes later we had to remind the waitress that we had not received our drinks,they weren't even relatively busy.The breakfast was cold and the staff were pleasant but didn't seem to know what they were doing. The room was nice but the carpet could have been cleaner. Wouldn't stay there again for that price.",1,2011,07,11
218,Stunnning hotel!,I recently stayed at this hotel for  close friends wedding and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The hotels itself and the grounds are beautiful. There is a lovely atmosphere in the hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful without being overly intrusive. The wedding meal we had was the best I've eaten I had beef which was cooked to perfection which is hard to pull off with a large group and timings to consider. The room the reception was held in was great for a large crowd as it is a split level room and guests don't have to leave for the band etc to set up. I would imagine that it would be a nice location for any event. I didn't use the spa so i cannot comment on that.,5,2011,06,28
218,Such a Magical Place,"Killashee House such a magical place inside and out. The Gardens and walks are kept in such breath taking bloom and beauty,  the food is first class and that was only dining in Jacks Bar we hope on our next visit soon to dine in the relaxing atmosphere of the Large Dining Room with it's Table D'hote menu. We enjoyed our few nights so much that we stayed an extra night. I would highly recommend this hotel as its one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in.",5,2011,06,21
218,"Such a relaxing stay, we will definitely be back","We booked the hotel as a treat to ourselves for our anniversary and we weren't disappointed. We stayed on a saturday night. On arrivial we were greeted by the most friendly and efficent gentleman on the desk. Even though there was a wedding on at the hotel  and  a lot of people checking in at the time, we were not delayed and were treated with the upmost respect. Our room had been upgraded to a classic room. The room was big and roomy, the decor may be a ltttle dated but thats what gives this hotel character. The bathroom was spacious with loads of hot water, though the bathroom floor needed a bit of a polish.  We dined in Jack's bar and the food was superb. A most relaxing time is what we were looking for and that is what we got. The staff in all areas were efficient and friendly. The best thing was that breakfast was served unitl 11am the next morning, which gave us time for a lie-in. there is a swimming pool and spa, however on this occassion we did not get to use. Overall we found the Killashee hotel a great place to get away and relax, we will most definitely go back and will be recommending it to our friends and family.",5,2011,06,20
218,Just Heaven,"Myself and a couple of girlfriends stayed in Killashee Hotel this May and I just had to say a few words about our experience. It was 100% enjoyable, the hotel is one of the finest for its interior and most importantly its staff. Myself and the girls had two spa treatments each which were heavenly and on the second day we took a trip to the Kildare Village, the village is only about 20 mins from the hotel (we had lunch in the fabulous italian restaurant)and we were able to use the Killashee bus. 
If anyone is looking for a relaxing break make sure you check out killashee as you wont be disappointed.",5,2011,06,14
218,Great Hotel!,"The accomodation was fab - very comfortable, clean and spacious. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had a great stay. Unfortunately, we didn't use the swimming pool and spa but by all accounts it was fab too.",5,2011,06,13
218,Top Class service from start to finish,"Having just returned from a well needed short break at the Kilashee House I felt obliged to write a review on our wonderful experience. From the time of booking we received a top class, professional and courteous service from all of the staff we encountered at the Hotel. We were delighted to receive a complimentary upgrade to a Junior suite which really set the tone for this great stay. Having stayed in numerous four star and 5 star hotels in recent times its sad to see the falling standards in terms of lack of staff, decline in the quality of food and entertainment, and  the general appearance of the hotel and standards in decline. I am happy to say that all of the above were just fantastic and the Kilashee has maintained its excellent repuation for Quality, standards and most importantly  its excellent staff. Cant wait for our next visit !!",5,2011,06,13
218,Just bad luck?,"We stayed here for a two night break and chose Killashee due to its proximity to Dublin and following reading some great reviews of the hotel. However on entering the room we both fell silent as we had 4-star expectations. In reality there was torn wallpaper, stained cushions, a cracked handbasin, a bowed uncomfortable bed and loose bathroom fixtures. We had only booked that same day and there was a wedding on so we both figured that we were left with the last room available. 

The next morning we complained about the room and the manager apologised and said that we should never have been put in a room with the issues outlined. He transferred us to a suite which was a big step up from our previous room. It had a separate sitting room (with a tv cabinet with no tv?!), a bathroom with a jaccuzi bath and a nice bedroom. We decided to each have a jacuzzi before going down for dinner but discovered there was no hot water coming from any taps or the shower. We contacted reception and they sent someone to the room who confirmed that there was no hot water. We were then told to run the bath as there was a draw on the water (we were on the first floor). We ran the bath for 40 minutes-no hot water. We were then told we may have to change rooms again so we repacked our stuff. Having heard nothing for a while about the move we rang reception again and we were told that it was a hotelwide issue and changing rooms was not going to help. We were told the issue would be resolved in 15-20 minutes. An hour from this and 3 hours later in total there was no hot water so we decided to forget about the baths and to go down for dinner. When we got back to our room at around 9pm we finally had hot water. 

We later decided to get breakfast delivered to our room the next morning, so we could have an extra lie in. It never arrived and the breakfast card was still hanging on the door the next morning. We did complain on checkout and did receive an apology and a discount from the manager but this was not a relaxing luxury break away as planned.

Staff were very apologetic and friendly during our stay and we enjoyed the food in the bar but I still feel the money we paid was not worth the stress of our stay. The manager also offered us an upgrade with our next visit. I started to laugh- we will not be back.",2,2011,06,09
218,Nothing more than average,"I'm dismayed to read the glowing reviews regarding this hotel. The exterior is undoubtedly impressive and the drive up to the hotel promises luxury and comfort. 

In reality, the hotel is drab and lacks atmosphere. The large bar area on the ground floor is contemporary in design and feel but it nothing more than an average super pub. 

The bedrooms were disappointing. The interior drab, dated, and long overdue an overhaul. We had problems with the hot water supply and while this was deal with efficiently, our stay didn't merit the cost. Devoid of comfort and luxury it dupes the guest into believing they will experience. 

We won't be back.",3,2011,06,03
218,A night of affordable luxury with great food and friendly service,"Kilashee is a beautiful hotel situated just outside the town of Naas.  We spent just one night there to celebrate our anniversary and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. There is ample car parking available even if there is a wedding at the hotel.  Check-in was prompt and friendly and our room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. We turned up half an hour early for dinner and were accommodated immediately.  Food was great, and we really enjoyed the entertainment in the bar afterwards.  Unfortunately we didn't have time to use the impressive leisure facilities, but hopefully will do next time.",4,2011,05,24
218,Faultless.,"I stayed at the Killashee House Hotel with 24 of my friends on Satuday 21st May to celebrate a birthday. The service from all concened was superb from start to finish. Nothing was a problem for Anita who took care of the reservation and she was a pleasure to deal with. The hotel is beautiful and gardens stunning. We ate lunch in Jack's, delicious, and the service/food in Turners restaurant on Saturday evening was superb. From check in to departure our party were looked after and not one person had a complaint. One friend said she had never been looked after so well at any other hotel. Even when going out to my car to collect some things in the pouring rain we were handed umberellas and accompanied by a really helpful young man, Ronan, who carried our belongings.
A wonderful break away. I would definately return soon with my husband and young children. Fabulous.",5,2011,05,23
218,Lovely surroundings and fantastic friendly service,"We were over for Punchestown races for the week and were looking for a quality hotel within close proximity of the racecourse. In Killashee House Hotel we got that and so much more.

The room was large and well appointed and the leisure facilities excellent but what really sets killashee apart from any other hotel of this standard or even reportedly higher is its response to any queries, quickly, caringly and effectively. If killashee House can achieve this at its busiest time of the year then that is some  testament to its customer service.

We will definately  be back next year. Thank you all.",5,2011,05,17
218,Staff and Food amazing.,"We stayed in this hotel on the 6th and 7th of May and I'm delighted to say that standards havent slipped at all since our last visit about a year ago. When we arrived at check in it was very busy as a wedding party had arrived and we all wanted to check in at once however there was plenty staff on reception and they got through the queue pretty quickly but without rushing us, They took the time to explain how to get to our room and the facilities etc.
I was very slightly dissapointed with the room but to be honest it really was my own fault I forgot to request a non smoking room. There was no smell of smoke at all but I do remember that the last time we stayed the room and bathroom was a good bit nicer. This was the only very very slight negative.
The food and staff in this hotel are amazing. The hotel must treat their staff well as we seen some of the same staff there again this year. I dont mean to be fussy but I am a pain in the rear to take a food order from I always want something on the side and more of the potatoes and less of this and that but the guy who took our order for dinner (think he was bar manager) was so patient and didnt make me feel like a nuisance at all. My fillet steak was so delecious it was absolute perfection! Again at dessert I asked for a bit of this and a bit of that on my crepe and the waitress and the chef were so accomodating. Killashee House have the best Chef of any hotel I have stayed in and we only ate in the bar. I love the atmosphere of the bar so we chose not to go to the restaurant but its menu looked lovely.
Breakfast is really nice as it is all too uncommon now in even a 5 star hotel to get a cooked to order breakfast but Kilashee still take your order at the table which is a really nice touch. The buttermilk pancakes are fab!
Treatment in the spa was very relaxing. I only really use spas in hotels when away from home and some can be slightly intimidating but not here the receptionist was friendly and the girl who did my massage and facial was very professional without being cold and unfriendly (dark haired Sligo girl). It was the nicest spa experience I have had.
Overall top marks again for Killashee it is well worth the money. We will be back!",5,2011,05,15
218,"Beautiful, relaxing, idyllic","I recently took a group of 12 ladies to the Killashee house. We all thought our rooms were lovely, clean and well maintained. The facilities in the hotel were fabulous and in keeping with the style of furnishing you would expect from a house dating from 1861. The dining was superb and the staff could not do enough for us. The Spa is beautiful and the staff there really know there business. I had fantastic treatments and walked out of there a new woman. The leisure centre was clean and well laid out. All in all I would recommend the Killashee house to friends and family to try. I will be returning to the spa on a regular basis.",5,2011,05,13

218,Fawlty Towers on a grand scale!,"We went to Kilashee House Hotel to celebrate a family birthday. Our party consisted of 12 adults and 8 children. After arriving and checking in we made our way to our room. This turned out to be an adventure but not a good one. After walking down the lobby we located the lift tucked around the corner. We went up one floor to arrive out into what was a very large lounge/bar area which seemed to be catering for a wedding party. After walking to the other side we were met by some confusing signs and a maze of corridors. Eventually we came to the end only to discover that we needed to take another lift to go back down one floor or take the stairs.The lift doors opened to reveal another long corridor which was heated like a sauna. Finally we found our room after what seemed like a marathon. Bizarre that a whole wing of bedrooms could be built with access like this. The room we found was ok. Nothing spectacular but not the worst. A tv which worked properly would have been nice as would a fridge or mini bar for cooling drinks. Some complimentary water for drinking would have been welcome. The bathroom was quite dated and could do with some basic maintenance like fixing the washbasin properly to the ledge. 

After trekking back to the lobby we went to meet the rest of our party in the bar located  accross from the reception desk. We needed some extra chairs and my husband asked a member of staff if he had any. The answer was ""no"" which came accross as very unhelpful and rude. There were tables full of dirty plates and glasses and trying to get lounge service was nearly impossible. Surprisingly dinner in Turners restaurant was good. There was one lovely helpful waitress but the rest left alot to be desired. Some training in this area is essential. The food overall was good and was enjoyable. After dinner we returned to the bar to have some even worse service than during the afternoon. Staff in the bar could also do with some training,  especially in manners and how to treat customers.

After a nights sleep we were all looking forward to our breakfast. And what an experience it turned out to be! We queued up for our table and were given one after about 10 minutes. This was located beside the doors to the kitchen which was the perfect place to witness the shambles that followed! Breakfast consists of a buffet for cold foods and a hot breakfast which has to be ordered from a waiter and brought to your table. We started at the buffet which turned out to be very poor. A very small selection of cereals, fruit, pastries, salami and juice. A huge improvement could be made here. Replenishment of certain things was very slow. After asking three different people for a menu we were eventually given one after about 15 minutes. During this time waiters were continually coming to the table holding plates asking us was this our food. We told them each time that we hadn't even ordered yet. They were all wandering around aimlessly carrying plates of food from one side if the room to the other. A waitress then came out of the kitchen carrying a plate full of cut melon. She dropped half of it on the floor which she saw and kept walking. Luckily someone returning to the kitchen saw it and cleared it before an accident happened. After a 20 minute wait after ordering our breakfasts eventually arrived. The food was very poor. Cold eggs which were like rubber and hard in the middle, a sausage which was obviously deep fried and hard on the outside and greasy inside and half a tomato which was completely raw and certainly hadn't seen any sign of cooking! A member of our party asked for toast three times and never got it. To top it all a waitress started clearing the table before we were finished. A complete disaster! Basil Fawlty could run this diningroom better!

Not what I would expect from a four star hotel on any level. Needless to say I don't think any of us shall be returning in a hurry!",2,2011,03,28
218,"Spacious, Elegant Hotel, Great Service ...","We'd a brilliant time here for the baby's first birthday last weekend. 

Staff were exceptionally helpful, prompt and personable. We actually stayed in three different rooms as my wife wanted a better view than we had in the first room (though it was otherwise excellent) and all three were different and beautiful in their own way.

We got a lot of room service as it was just easier with the baby and that worked out great - prompt, properly hot food, no mistakes or omissions. Great quality too, and we'd have fairly high standards. There's a €5 room service charge person, which I think is fair enough.

The pool is pretty big (25m?) and there's a smaller pool for kids too. Bring your own hats though, as they cost €3 each otherwise. Massive, modern gym too.

There is a great sense of space in Killashee House.",5,2011,03,19
218,"Beautiful hotel, most enjoyable stay","Recently stayed at Killashee as a little treat for one night. We had dinner included in our package (really good value) in Turners restaurant. The food was just amazing and the staff were really lovely. We had a few drinks in the bar after which is quite lively considering the location is just outside the town but again we were really well looked after. Our room overlooked the stunning gardens and had 2 large double beds, the grounds of the hotel are incredible and a walk around them is highly recommended.  Overall it's a stunning hotel with lots of character and really lovely staff.",5,2011,02,27
218,This hotel is a rip off!!,"I booked the overnight spa break for myself and my daughter in January in this hotel and talk about being disappointed!!!!!!!!!!  The deal was €360 for one night with two taster spa treatments which I thought was good value as I was expecting a really good experience.   The night cost just under €600 as we got extra spa treatments and had wine with our meal which I thought was very expensive and sooooooo not worth the money.  I had stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago for a wedding and did really enjoy the experience but boy has this hotel gone down, down, down.  The whole hotel needs a good paint/redecoration, on the first floor where there is a residents bar the seats are disgusting with stains all over them.  Our room was old and dirty and their Villa Spa was a disgrace.  We got robes that were completely threadbare and when we took them off we actually realised there was HOLES in them.  The relaxation room in the Villa Spa is FILTHY, didnt feel at all comfortable lying on their beds.  The meal in their restaurant on the Saturday night was indeed nice but the hot breakfast the next day was horrible, the plate was red hot but everything on it was rock hard, obviously it had been in an oven for quite a while.  When we checked out I left a comment card with my complaints but no one got back to me.  I sent an email to the Manager and eventually she rang me back but had not investigated my compliants, she did offer me an upgrade for my next stay in the hotel which I found insulting as I will NEVER frequent this hotel again.  Be warned people, this hotel is not a 4 star hotel, the place is filthy and do not attempt to go to their Villa Spa.",1,2011,02,16
218,Top price should equal top quality all round- not here though,"Went here for a one night break specifically to avail of the spa. However, when we got there we were told that there was no chance of getting a booking! So we proceeded to use the gym and pool- which was good. Decided we would get up early the following morning to make more use of it. As it was over Chritsmas we were worried it might not be open as early as usual. So just in case I phoned reception and was assured it was open (it was 0830 am). Got ready and trekked over (the spa and pool are in a different buidling) only to find it was closed and not open until 10 am!!!!! Hard to believe from a place that markets itself as a top quality 4 star. Oh and be warned this appears to be a wedding hot spot and also very family friendly- to the point of little kids running around and playing in the bar until late- not ideal if you want to get away from it all. The fact that it is a weeding spot also means it is usually full of loud wedding guests!!! Can effect your sleep if you get the wrong room. All in all for the price we paid- whihc was quite high- it was simply not worth it. When you pay top dollar you want a top experience- this place simply did not deliver- be warned and be careful folks!",3,2011,01,25
218,Grand Entrance but service well below par for a 4 Star Hotel,"Stayed here during  bank holiday w/end October 2010 as we were checking out venues for a wedding this time around, I should say we had stayed here 4 years ago and were very impressed by the hotel back then, unfortunately the experience this time around was memorable for all the wrong reasons, checked on Saturday night to find that the room we had requested and confirmed had been allocated to another couple, we were hastily changed to another room, very impressed by the young porter who assisted us with carrying bags to our room.As we were on a two night Dinner bed and breakfast package we dined in Turners Restaurant, once we were shown to our table and placed our wine and food order the service staff seemed to forget completely about the guests, infact we were 75% through our mains before the wine arrived and that was after 15 minutes trying to get the attention of a waiter to remind them, nobody seems to take any responsibility and all waiting staff seemed to disappear once orders were taken!!
As we were staying in the hotel we had drinks in Jacks Bar on both nights where the Bar staff were extreemly efficient and could not do enough for guests. Perhaps is was a mistake to dine in the restaurant and have the bar food instead however we were trying out the hotel for size !!!
On check morning out we were delighted to find our ""Bill had been paid"" after 15 minutes of confusion it appears that they had accidentally checked out another couple from our room earlier that morning, eventually we got to pay and we went about our business, the lack of general professionalism concerned us so much that we decided to check with our credit card provider and unsurprisingly a bill for another room had also been debited to our card at 9am whilst we were still in bed. Got the matter sorted and card re credited very little confidence in the running of this hotel, we took our wedding business elsewhere.",3,2011,01,03
218,Fantastic,"We had our wedding in Killashee on July 5th, 2010 and it couldn't have been better. I'm amazed by some of the negative comments as wecouldn't fault it. ALL staff were very accommodating to us and especially our guests. Prior to booking the Killashee, we visited many hotels around Dublin but none compared to it. We were sold from the minute we walked into the reception & were greeted by Orla. It is a lovely homely hotel and we felt instantly relaxed every time we visited the hotel. Nothing we requested was too much trouble. Lisa & the events team were on hand for all the preperations leading up to the wedding. The day itself was amazing and went very smoothly.  The food & staff were EXCELLENT. All guests were offered seconds which was a lovely touch. Our family and friends are still talking about it. I would highly recommend this venue for the perfect wedding. We have amazing pics from the grounds. We can't wait to visit on our first year anniversary. Thanks to all for a perfect day. Scott and Emer",5,2010,12,28
218,Poor poor service,"I'll keep it short and sweet because I dont want to waste any more time on this hotel. Public areas are fine but if you book a ""standard"" room the standards are lacking, service is scatty and rude. It seems if you are staying for a wedding your business is surpluss to requirement.  We stayed 3 nights and actually contemplated leaving early! Would not recommend to friend....or foe.",2,2010,12,03
218,Very relaxing,Really lovely place. We were made to feel very welcome and the facilities were top notch. Grand little bar and the food in both restaurants was delicious. I would recommend this place highly for a nice getaway for a couple.,4,2010,11,30
218,Very nice....but expected more!,"I stayed here for a weekend with my wife. On arrival we were greeted wormly by a very friendly girl at reception. Then the adventure begins. Locating your room and subsequently getting back to reception is a true adventure in this hotel - not that I found that a bad thing - it adds to the charm in my view. However, we did come across a number of people over the weekend wandering aimlessly through the corridors searching for the way back to reception. Food in the ""fine-dining"" restaurant was very nice and excellent service. On the second night, we ate food in Jacks bar and if anything the food in here was even nicer and very reasonably priced. Again - very good service. I suppose the only downside in my view was the room. We booked into an ""opulent 4 poster room"" (as the website describes it) and I just felt a little let down by it. Very clean and spacious and comfortable but a little dated and drab at the same time. Overall we enjoyed it but I just expected a little more from the rooms.",4,2010,11,18
218,Nice hotel but expected better,"We stayed here last week for wedding anniversary (mid week). When i phoned to book receptionist gave me free upgrade to a junior suite which was a great start! The grounds of hotel are beautiful and the building itself is fabulous. The junior suite turned out to be a good big room, huge four poster bed and complementary basket of fruit. The bathroom is a bit tired looking - crack in one of the sinks, floor tiles are a bit grim. Also the heating was acting up, wasn't working when we arrived in room, was fixed then broke again when we got back after dinner that night. I'd have to say the the room was nice but nothing amazing. I didn't feel like was staying in a really beautiful room.

We had treatments in the spa, which by the way is across the carpark from main hotel so don't be tempted as i nearly was to head over in my bathrobe!! I had a back massage which was meant to be 30mins but more like 20. Also, the hydrotherapy pool is broken and therapist told me probably won't be fixed. I've since heard it's been broken for some time which was really disappointing as i was particularly looking forward to it. The rest of the spa is lovely though and very relaxing but i do think they should say the pool is not in use.

There is another swimming pool and gym in the country club right beside the spa but again this would've involved getting dressed, going outside then in again - not worth the hassle.

We had dinner included in our package but this was in the bar as Turners restaurant is not open mid week. Was told about this when booking which was fine and actually the bar was probably my favourite part of hotel, it's gorgeous and the food was fantastic. 

Breakfast was okay but service a bit sloppy had to wait ages for butter, noone to take order etc. 

Overall i expected better from Killashee. It's not cheap and even though we got the upgrade i didn't feel it was good value. The 30 minute spa treatments are robbery, so not worth it! Best part was the bar, great food, great service. We had a good time but I don't think i'd go back.",3,2010,10,21
218,Killer stay at the Kilashee,"What can I say?  The Kilashee gave me a room bigger than most of the apartments I've had over the years.  Incredbily comfortable and well appointed, it's a room I wish I had a chance to spend more time in during my stay.  The hotel is located on a beautiful estate but since I was visiting from the U.S. for a conference I didn't get to experience much of the offerings that many of the Irish guests visit for.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend a stay at the Kilashee.  It's particularly well suited for small business conferences.",5,2010,10,02
218,Brilliant,"Stayed for two nights here in September. I have no complaints whatsoever, it was superb from start to finish, beautiful setting, rooms, bathrooms, food, drink etc. I will definitly return here again, soon i hope!",5,2010,09,30
218,An Oasis within a beautiful County in Ireland,"Three nights and two eveing meals in this hotel provided nothing but praise for it. By that I have to principally mean the staff who make the extremely pleasant inside and external environment of the hotel so welcoming, even though the building itself is far from being attractive. Even though we were often served by different staff durng both breakfast and dinner every one waiting at table knew just what had been ordered and the service was seamless - testimony to high quality training.
The Spa is something really special with a very large pool, two steam rooms, two saunas, and two jaccuzzis and more than adequate lockable changing facilities.
Plenty of car parks and lounges within the hotel and large well appointed bedrooms.
There is only one aspect that you must get used to and that is finding your way around the hotel. Don't be put off for it is good fun, but, we were in a 200 series room which meant taking one lift to the thrid floor, (Ground floor is actually floor 1 to the lift), going through a lounge and corridor to the next lift and going down a floor before walking on a corridor to our room. Don't be put off by this; it really becomes a reason for a smile, if not a laugh, each time you go to or from your room.
I strongly recommend this hotel which also has a great history worth exploring.",5,2010,09,26
218,excellent,Stayed Saturday night.  Lovely hotel with nice foyers to sit and relax in.  Beautiful spa area.  The meal at Turners restaurant was amazing.  Lovely food. Great skill evident from the chef.,5,2010,09,25
218,Dreadful Experience - Hotel Room was Filthy!,"My partner and I were guests at a wedding in this establishment. Upon arriving at the hotel we were quite taken with the external appearance which was impressive and clearly well maintained. Unfortunately upon arriving at our accommodation; room 102, which bizarrely despite being located on the ground floor had to be tediously accessed via the third floor; we noticed that the care and attention afforded to the hotel’s exterior was clearly not extended to the bedroom.
The description of the accommodation on the hotel website is as follows:

•	Accommodation at Killashee House Hotel & Villa Spa includes 141 opulent guest rooms.  
•	Each luxuriously furnished en-suite bedroom offers a welcome retreat for you to relax in. 
•	Rooms are uniquely styled and all ooze old world charm.

It is only fair to say that we were both completely shocked by the condition of our “Old World Style” accommodation as it is described on the website. The only thing the room oozed was dirt and stains. The room that greeted us was completely at odds with the images of rooms we had seen on the website. Having booked a double room over the phone we found ourselves staying in a room containing two double beds. Whilst this was not a major issue it could be considered indicative of the levels of attention to detail maintained at Killashee House. If the extra bed was a mere oversight, the appalling levels of hygiene and cleanliness of the room sadly cannot be considered the same. 
The dressing table chair was absolutely filthy and had obviously not been cleaned for some time. There was a large wet stain on the seat. There were filthy brown stains on the walls and carpet and black stains on the floor near the beds. The ceiling in the room was sporadically splattered with unidentifiable stains. The stain theme also extended to the bathroom door and the main door into the room where a large encrusted stain was smeared down the fire exit instructions. The frame of the bathroom door was in a sorry state of disrepair with pieces of it missing and broken away and the bathroom itself was tired and neglected with poor lighting and an uninviting bath / shower. The bedroom window was covered with net curtains that looked as though they had been washed in dirty water, or not at all, and the window itself was difficult to see through due to the level of dirt and bird faeces covering it.
Our room was obviously located next to the delivery bay which sprang into life at approximately 7.30am on Saturday morning. I understand this is an unavoidable necessity however the lack of soundproofing and the clear lack of seals on the aforementioned window meant that we were both woken prematurely by the noise of reversing trucks – hardly the tranquil setting that is promoted on the website
All of these factors combined to make our stay at Killashee quite unpleasant indeed. 
I do not feel any guest should be expected to accept or ignore the appalling levels of hygiene and cleanliness which we found in our room. As a couple who are at an age where we are currently involved in the so called “wedding circuit” we feel that after our disastrous experience Killashee is certainly not living up to its reputation as a top wedding destination and we would therefore struggle to find reason to recommend it to other friends considering the location for their big day or indeed consider it ourselves when the time comes. This was our fourth wedding in twelve months and having stayed overnight at all three other weddings in the Portmarnock Golf Links, Mount Juliet in Kilkenny and Solis Lough Eske in Donegal, Killashee does not even come close to the standards we experienced in all of the other establishments

I wrote to the Manager of the Hotel to complain about our experience and we received a letter back offering us a night at the hotel at a ""Favourable Rate"". In my view this is completely inadequate having already shelled out for the horrendous experience we had I have no intention of returning to pay for another night. Very disappointing",1,2010,09,24
218,"Lovely Hotel, Excellent Restaurant 1 Flaw","We stayed in this hotel as a romantic break away. The Location is perfect as it is close to major roads and still private. The Food in the restaurant is fantastic & service was brilliant at all times even for breakfast. The only part that I felt let this hotel down was the Cleaniness. 
We stayed in one of the four poster suites (which are not cheap) but the dust on the Curtain covering the bed were extreme.... This was this hotels only Flaw in an otherwise perfect stay.. Shame! 
PS the Gardens are Beautiful and this is a perfect location for a wedding",4,2010,09,20
218,Superb services and beautiful setting,"Driving into the hotel grounds immediately gave a feeling of luxury and relaxation. The staff were all very attentive, polite, friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious. 
It was lovely to wander around this big old building as it had lots of differnt rooms and hallways. A nice change to modern boring hotel chains. It was full of character, and very clean. 
Had a meal in Jacks and was very impressed. All courses were restaurant standard and the creme brulee was divine!
The breakfast was great with anything you could wish for availalbe.
The leisure centre was large and very well equipped. 
Did not get the chance to go to the spa.. hopefully on the next trip.",5,2010,08,24
218,Great Hotel,"We spent two nights at Kilashee last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it.
The rooms were large with two double beds, a safe and tea\coffee facilities.
The 25m pool is great with two large jacuzzi’s. 

The bar Jacks, had late night music on both nights and it was very lively.
We ate both in Jacks and in Turners restaurant.  The manager in Jacks was very accommodating when we  arrived without a reservation.  We found the food delicious and the service great.  The breakfast was wonderful with a large variety of cereals\ fruit \ cooked breakfasts.

There was a wedding reception in the hotel on both Fri and Sat.  This function room was away from the main hotel and we never heard any late night noise.

The only downside is the layout of the hotel… very confusing esp if you are trying to find the pool\spa which is located across a carpark.
Despite this we wouldn't hesitate in staying here again.",4,2010,08,20
218,I stayed in killashee last week for a 1...,I stayed in killashee last week for a 1 night stay I was travelling around the country on business. I got a very nice welcome from a friendly smiling receptionist ( Susan ) check in was very quick and a painless experience . I had dinner in jacks bar which was a very tasty meal decor is nice but a little cold for my taste. I did not get a chance to use leisure facilities. Breakfast in the morning was nice coffee was bit strong was my only fault with it. On departure the same receptionist she was very efficient remembered my name had bill ready for me. One thing I would say the area just outside the front door could redone it's very uneven. Overall it was a pleasant stay and I look forward to my return hopefully for a longer stay ,4,2010,08,18
218,Fabulous Spa - Best Ever,"Just back from a visit  with my sister and a friend for a spa package that included 1 dinner, absolutely brillant. The spa is beautiful and the staff are incredible. Hotel is lovely as well, and staff are nice as well but the Spa staff really make the extra efford. Only negative thing was the breakfast, we had all ordered the Irish breakfast and all of them were cold and the puddings were hard as rocks, toast was freezing by the time the hot food came and we ordered more, but had finished eating but the time it came. Staff seemed all over teh place, no body seemed to have their own section to do. Apart from the breakfast, it was fantastic.",5,2010,08,16
218,Dreadful food,"Istayed in Killashee House Hotel with friends on a one night dinner, bed and breakfast deal. The building and the grounds are stunning.  The staff are friendly.  It was quite difficult to find our room as you had to get two elevators and/or go downstairs to get up; the signage indicating this was ineffectively positioned. The rooms were very standard and the beds were very comfortable.  No water and only one facecloth.
The bar downstairs, Jacks is dark, ugly and lacking in atmosphere.  I found it oppressive and incongruent to the style of the building.
What disappointed me most was the food.  It was dreadful; really dreadful.  We had to eat in the bar as we had a small baby with us and were not allowed have a late sitting in the dining room.  The food was very very poor quality and badly presented.  I had sea bass which was probably older than myself and overcooked.  I then had ice-cream which I could not eat as it tasted so cheap.  As I was leaving early, I was told that I would have to have breakfast in my room as the dining room does not open until 8am.  The breakfast was equally bad.  Fruit salad that had clearly been prepared days ago, orange juice from a tin (a lot of water and not much concentrate), luke-warm, tasteless coffee, cold toast.......and I had to pay €5 extra for the privilege.
The hotel is not family friendly and actively discourages people with children (read the bar menu!!)  Don't even think about it if  you have children.
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. There are far better deals available with nicer interiors, better service and better food. It was a huge disappointment.",3,2010,08,15
218,Beautiful hotel in lovely grounds,"We stayed here for one night before heading back to Dublin. We were taken away with the sight of the hotel when we first saw it as it is so beautiful. The grounds are amazing and I can imagine make a wonderful setting for a wedding. The reception staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome on arrival. Our room was very grand and decorated to a high standard. We used the swimming pool which was amazingly warm and inviting, and also allows children to use the facility which was surprising at such a posh establishment. During our stay we ate at Jack's restaurant which was of a high standard and enjoyed by us all. The breakfast in the morning was also of a high standard with a good choice of menu. This hotel itself is really interesting as it was once a convent and boarding school.",5,2010,08,14
218,Looking forward to returning,"Spent a two night stay at the Kilashee, beautiful setting, staff are extremely friendly & helpful, our first time staying and we were upgraded which was a great start.  The only negative would have to be that we ate both nights in Jacks Bar, food wasn't wonderful, although breakfast both mornings was excellent.  The accommodation standard and friendliness of staff would be enough to make me look forward to returning.",5,2010,07,28
218,"OK, but restaurant experience spoiled stay.","I stayed with there on Saturday night on a DBB basis.

I really like the new bar area and extensive food menu available there. Much nicer than the Nuns Kitchen!

Two problems in main restaurant, which is supposed to be fine dining! 

On Saturday evening I ordered the Duck from the dinner menu – cooked medium. 

It came out well done, so I sent it back. The next duck dish arrived out, slightly less well done but still not medium. Medium duck should be slightly pink in the middle, this was cooked the whole way through.

Rather than send another dinner back, I chose not to say anything as my wife and I were out for a nice night out.

At breakfast the following morning, I ordered an omelette with ham, mushrooms and onion. It came out with tomatoes in it, so I sent it back and told the waitress what it should have been. The second omelette came out, this time with cheese in it, and no mushrooms. At this stage I just sent it back telling the girl that I would have some fruit instead as I didn’t want to wait another 10 minutes for a third attempt at my breakfast. No manager came to the table to deal with the wrong food being sent out and we left and checked out as we had planned.

I live locally, and I’ve eaten and drank in Killashee several times in the last couple of years – but this sort of shoddy care and attention to detail would turn me off going back.

I emailed the hotel, and several days later I got a poorly written reply littered with spelling and grammatical mistakes, which reflects the shoddy service in the hotel to a tee!",2,2010,07,15
218,Heaven on earth,"We love to spoil ourselves to occasional trips at Killashee, we tend to go midweek to avoid the weddings and because it suits our work schedules but I normally stay in hotels for work.  I stay at a lot of hotels so I can see the difference between the ones that care and the ones that don't.

Killashee has a fantastic dining room, upgrade yourself to a junior suite - it won't break the bank but is a touch of luxury.  I recommend leaving the Blackberry or mobile in the car because if it rings in the public areas you will be burned at the stake.

This hotel is a quiet haven, at reasonable prices, making you feel that you are the most important person in the world - if only for a couple of days.",5,2010,07,04
218,I expected more,"My husband and I stayed here for a night for our anniversary. Lets just say i'm glad it was only one night. First of all my husband paid for an upgrade to the room which was suppose to include a fruit bowl. That wasn't there, and it was the most expensive bowl of fruit! We went down to the desk and I asked, we were told it would be put in after 12 the next day. Not much use to us staying one night?? The restuarant was only ok. My husband is a chef and runs a restuarant in the area so we expected a lot. The starter was lovely but apart from that it was bland and boring. Maybe they should hire my husband as head chef and get rid of who ever is there. 
As for the room...it smelled, it was dusty, it SMELLED SO BAD of smoke, the toilet paper wasn't even refilled in the bathroom which I really didn't like.

We ordered breakfast to our room the next morning. It was cold. The ""hot chocolate"" was stone cold. Food had obviously been cooked well in advance and had been sitting for a long time. Half it could have bounced off the walls.

I did complain the next morning and we didn't get any answers except for ""that's unusual"" which from reading reviews clearly it's not. Will never stay here again. This is not a low star hotel and is not cheap but it feels cheap to stay here.",2,2010,06,26
218,Fantastic!,"After reading a few reviews on this site, we were a bit apprehensive about staying.  We needn't have worried.  The staff at check-in were extremely helpful.  We had booked half board.  The staff in the restaurant were superb and dinner was fantastic.  The room was comfortably furnished and we had a great night's sleep as it was so quiet.  Our 5 year old also had dinner in Jack's bar.  Very impressed.  The leisure facilities are second to none, with a great gym, full size pool and baby pool.  We now wish we had stayed for 2 nights and will definitely be back.",5,2010,06,14
218,"Disappointing - great hotel if you are a wedding guest, not great if you are not","I stayed at this hotel with three girlfriends for two nights. I had been recommended the hotel and was looking forward to a lovely weekend. I was disappointed immediately when I entered the hotel lobby because although it was a lovely day, the hotel was dark inside. When I walked into the bar I was even more disappointed. The style of the bar cannot easily be described as there are about ten different styles going on. I thought it was horrible and found it hard to just relax and chat. It was the opposite of feng shui.  

Several of the hotel areas were closed off to non wedding/party guests. On Friday and Saturday there were weddings and birthday parties which left the individual hotel guests feeling like outsiders.  

The hotel grounds were lovely but the walk from the hotel to the spa and swimming pool was not nice. The spa was really lovely and was the feature that saved the weekend for me. The staff there were really friendly and the spa itself was elegant. 

The food in the bar and in the restaurant was fine, with the breakfast being worth a particularly positive mention. However, when we asked the waiter for a recommendation for a wine with our evening meal, he had no idea. He could also not answer questions about the menu. I think that that is pretty basic. 

The rooms were spacious but decorated in such an old fashioned style that it brought me back to the 80's. The bathroom was ok but the showerhead in the bathtub could not be removed from the wall, making it impossible to rinse the bath down.

All in all I felt that this hotel was lacking in style, suitable for weddings and parties but not for individuals. The staff were friendly but I expect that as a minimum. Overall the hotel was clean.",3,2010,06,14
218,Great location - abysmal service,"I stayed here for three nights with my wife, two young children and 7 friends on the June Bank Holiday weekend 2010. The hotel itself is stunning on the eye and the surrounding grounds are beautiful. The service levels however in the bar, restaurant and hotel itself make 'Fawlty Towers' look like a 7 star hotel. There was no complimentary water in the room, no fridge for the childrens bottles (which we requested prior to arrival), no help with bags, toilets are down a huge staircase (think young children and old folk), you don't get what you order in either the restaurant or the bar and when it does arrive its over 1 hour late. There was 2 barman behind the bar trying to cater for a wedding party of about 70 people, at one stage the manager of the bar arrives and realises it was really busy so he left!! Breakfast takes about an hour to arrive, our meal in the restaurant lasted 4 hours because the service was so bad. There was no playground for ther children, the pool in the leisure centre is too small and the spa is way overpriced. Whoever is managing this placed should be ashamed because they are destroying the reputation of a once reputable and prestigous hotel. We had many discussions in the bar and restaurant with alot of guests whose exprerience was identical and in some case worse than ours!! Get new staff quickly or remind the current staff that the customer is the most important person especially in 2010. If you are not a wedding party in this hotel then you are not relevant to the staff. We were kept awake by the music from the wedding until 2am because our room was quire close to the ballroom. We won't be back in a hurry.",1,2010,06,08
218,Absolute Heaven!,"Just back from a two night stay in Killashee House and it has been unbelivably perfect. Im not sure exactly what one thing made our stay so relaxing but all the small details make you just relax and unwind from the minute you drive up the tree lined avenue in the fabulous grounds. On the day of our arrival we arrived very late that night due to unforseen circumstances and had to ring the hotel for directions, The receptionist couldnt have been more helpful and when we did arrive shortly after she greeted me by name and was so friendly and efficent we were in our room within minutes which was lovely as we were so tired.
Waking up on Sunday morning we found the sunday newspaper left outside our door which was a lovely touch! Breakfast on both mornings was yummy and freshly cooked not buffet which is great. I think one of the main highlights of our trip was our dinner in Jacks, I had the steak which was so tender and full of flavour and I must mention our waitress I think her name is Dace she was so friendly and helpful.
This hotel is just perfection, I found on this trip I wasnt in fantastic party mood due to personal circumstances and the great thing about Kilashee House is you can just wander around the grounds and spend time in peace and quite and then head to Jacks Bar in the evening where you just feel comfortable and relaxed while having a lovely meal.
Last but not least every single time I passed a member of staff they said hello this is nice and coupled with the lovely rooms complete with bathrobe and slippers I cant wait to return and sample the Spa next time!",5,2010,06,07
218,Sheer luxury and relaxation,"I booked Killashee on their Girlie Getaway package for myself and two friends and added in some spa treatments in The Villa Spa  as well.  I then read some of the really negative reviews on Trip Advisor and was a little concerned that the trip wouldn't be up to our expectations.
I'm delighted to report that our expectations were far exceeded from the welcome we received by the reception staff right through to the waiting staff and housekeeping staff followed by the beautiful meal in Turner's Restaurant.  Our treatments in the Villa Spa were sublime and delivered by competent, professional staff.  We all felt truly pampered and chilled after just 1 hour in the Spa.  Yes you do have to walk outside to get to the spa but a 2 minute walk is nothing when everything you need in terms of changing facilities, lockers, showering etc. is provided in abundance.  Plus, if you're really lazy you can drive from the main car park to the Villa Spa carpark!
Our booking for both the hotel and spa was confirmed by phone the day before our trip and everything was in place for our arrival.  The layout of the hotel is perhaps a little unusual but it is an old building and we were offered help with our bags and directions to our room were more than clear and well sign-posted.
There were two weddings in the hotel while we were there but we were not aware of any wedding-related noise/crowding as everything is so spacious.
Our 4-course dinner in Turner's was simply beautiful, cooked to perfection and served by attentive and friendly staff - nothing was too much trouble.
If you're looking a quiet getaway with good food, good bar and amazing spa facilities rounded off with welcoming, friendly and attentive staff then look no further than Killashee - I can't wait to go back!",5,2010,06,07
218,Great service,"I was making my way down to Cork from Dublin and my agent booked me into this hotel as it is close to where he lives. It is set well into lovely rolling countryside, so you need a car to go exploring. It is very grand and does lots of weddings. The reception area is really spacious and the staff are extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble. I paid about €89 for the night, B&B. I was also meeting a customer in the evening and there is so much public space in the lobby, sun room and 1st floor bar area, it's really good. My room was quite tradional in style, quite spacious, and quiet, and there were a good selection of TV channels. I ate in the bar and the bar menu was very good. With the Pound being weak everything seems dear but prices are normal for Ireland. The bar is quite contemporary and choice of drinks is good. Parking is easy at the hotel, and free.",4,2010,05,11
218,Enjoyed it immensley,"I attended a wedding here with my partner and we really enjoyed our stay. The staff were very helpful and on hand during the meal. Eveyone was raving about the food, it was really gorgeous.",4,2010,05,04
218,lovely hotel,"we attended a wedding in hotel in april.  had a wonderful stay.  hotel is lovely and staff very friendly.  rooms are nice and big and tastefully decorated.  meal with wedding was best we have ever tasted at a wedding.  unfortunatley we didnt get to try breakfast next morning, but apparently its really good.",4,2010,04,19
218,Excellent hotel,I cannot fault one element of this hotel. It is a gem!,5,2010,04,16
218,love it!,"This hotel was literally a lifesaver! En Route from Dublin to Cork after a business meeting, I was overwhelmed by the sudden change in weather (a blizzard!), and decided to stop over somewhere for the night. I had stayed at the hotel once before for a staff Christmas do, and was thrilled to find the details of same stored in my sat nav. I literally phoned the hotel from the road (hands free, of course!), and the receptionist was exceptionally helpful, and arranged to hold a room for me without the hassle of credit card details etc, as I was driving. 
On arrival, she had already printed off my booking, and had the room key ready - I literally just gave her an imprint of my credit card, and I was good to go.
The room was large, and very tastefully decorated, with an enormous en suite bathroom - old school, but classy (and without the mothball smell!). A super-yummy bar menu, and  huge buffet breakfast rounded off my stay, and I would definitely recommend the place to anyone!",5,2010,03,30
218,Good Overnight Stay,"This is my 3rd time to stay at Killashee House Hotel.  The last time was 3 years previously, in 2007.  

Myself and my husband went for a night away.   I found the reception staff to be very helpful, efficient and pleasant.  Our room had was spacious and clean and relatively close to the main part of the hotel.  

We ate in Turners restaurant.  Our initial seat was located beside a group of ladies, one of whom was boring the rest of the group with tales of her son.  As we could hear the entire conversation without even trying to, we asked to be moved and were re-located without any fuss.  While the main courses took a while to get to us, they were worth the wait.

Breakfast was as you would expect, with plenty of everything - pastries, fresh fruit salad, breads, cereals, full Irish, scrambled eggs, yoghurt, tea, coffee etc etc.  The cleanliness of the delphware did leave something to be desired...... the plates and coffee cups felt as though they hadn't been washed properly, like there was a 'grit-like' feel off them.  The sugar bowl was a bit grubby too, with staining on the inside of the bowl.  

While we enjoyed our stay, i did feel the hotel had become a little 'tired' and there wasn't the same attention to detail as there was in 2007.  Service ranged from very good at reception to adequate in the dining room.",4,2010,03,24
218,A Really Nice Hotel...,"Just back from a 2 night stay in killashee. Treated my other half to a special offer that included spa treatment. (She was obviously delighted with that) Hotel was really comfortable and clean. Wanted to get away for couple of nights and would definitely consider staying again before the end of year. Staff Friendly, food great, location ideal for a quite couple of days away.",4,2010,03,09
218,I am completely shocked at the recent bad reviews & feel that this hotel is been unfairly judged,"Having read the latest review on Killashee I feel compelled to write a review myself. I have stayed in Killashee numerous times through business & I have also attended two weddings there in the past two years. I am completely shocked at the recent reviews & feel that this hotel is been unfairly judged. From personal experience, I have always found the Management & Staff extremely efficient and friendly. I actually stayed in Killashee again last week as I had business in Naas and when arrived at the hotel it was extremely busy as there seemed to be a function taking place however my check-in was very prompt, my room as always was clean, comfortable & more luxurious than normal as I got upgraded to a suite because of the other function taking place! 
I ate in Jacks that night as Turners was closed but I did have breakfast in Turners the following morning. I have to say that I was delighted to see that Turners has under gone a refurbishment and looks great as my only criticism of this hotel from previous stays was that Turners Restaurant had not been up to the same standard as rest of the hotel, it looked a little tired. All in all, I have nothing but the highest praise for this hotel & the team that work there & I look forward to my next visit.",5,2010,03,09
218,Wake up management team,"Killashee House has gone downhill dramatically in the past number of years. I could not believe my eyes when I returned to Killashee six years after my first visit. The hotel has gone from idyllic to very average. The new management has removed every last trace of character from the hotel (physically and staff-wise) for what reason I do not know. It was the perfect hotel so the slight slippage of standards under new management might be forgivable, but to ruin it is not. I will not return, sadly. If I was the new management team I would be ringing up the past owners and asking them for tips!!!",2,2010,03,06
218,Disappointing - and it looks like it happens a lot,"Reading the reviews here it looks like the hotel doesn't read tripadvisor because a lot of the stuff mentioned here in the negative feedback is still going on.
My wife took me here for a valentines treat which from check-in looked to be a comedy of errors.

Upon check in the receptionist asked what time we would like to eat at. My other half explained that there had been a number of calls about this during the week and she had received a call confirming dinner in Turners for 930pm. When the receptionist rang the restaurant there was no booking. So she offered us a seat in  Jacks - the bar! We said no. She said she would sort it out

We went to our room (the hotel is a maze of corridors and lifts) which had a nasty damp smell - we rang to change but they were fully booked.
The safe didn't work so I rang reception - they were sending someone - 30mins later I gave up waiting and went for a swim. That person must have gotten lost in the corridors or is stuck on one of the antiquated lifts.
Having followed the maze of corridors and lifts we finally found the leisure centre - the door to the carpark anyway, across which is the leisure centre. Thank god I wore the tracksuit bottoms and didn't go with the towel as I was going to do.
The centre is good though, extensive gym, nice pool, changing rooms etc

Drinks in the bar led me to believe that nobody likes to pick up dirty glasses - especially not management. What I can only assume was the bar manager walked by our table 4 times but didn't pick any of the empty glasses that cluttered the table. I asked a waitress when she was taking our order would she mind clearing the table - which she did, otherwise she would have ignored the dirty glasses.

Dinner was a huge let down - we order a wine, but it was out of stock, so they brought another that wasn't on the wine list.
I ordered crab cake to start which was ok
MOH ordered monkfish for the mains - came out tepid and covered in what was supposed to be sauce.
My loin of lamb was actually one rib and a lamb chop, doused in gravy. only for I was starving it was going back.
The underside of the plates were filthy - my plate actually left a black ring on the linen - which the waiter laughed off as he walked away
Desert was ok.
Back to the bar and every table was covered in dirty glasses and plates and cutlery. I went to the bar to order and there were four people behind a cramped bar making cocktails with two waiters standing at the end of the bar waiting for said cocktails - why weren't they clearing tables? Why was there four people behind a bar made for two? why was the counter covered from one end to the other in dirty glasses beer spills and receipts.

Not sure why this hotel has a four star rating - I certainly wouldn't give it.
Staff unattentive, room smelly, bar a mess, restaurant no great shakes surely breakfast would redeem the situation. Breakfast was good, plenty of everything - went for their ""signature"" scrambled egg and smoked salmon - translated on the plate as cup of scrabbled egg covered over with two slices of salmon straight out of the packet. No colour, no flair  - even a dash of parsley would have brightened this up.

V disappointing and won't be going back.",2,2010,02,16
218,Never again,"We had booked a dinner,b&b package for one night-a Saturday. The reception had no notice of our booking and we told that the restaurant was fully booked,but they would try to fit us in. They would ""give us a call""
So we found our room after negotiating two lifts and miles of corrdors.  The room was FREEZING,the  one radiator in the bedroom had been turned off and the one in the bathroom was trying to compete with the extractor fan, and losing.
No phone call so we went to reception to be told to report to the dining room at 6.30. Empty,but gradually filled up. The food was at best adequate,with a friendly enough staff,mostly Asian.
Back to the room to a tepid radiator which was dead by the morning, and again we were FREEZING. Couldnt use the bath or shower,far too cold.
All this reported to the reception in the morning who promised  to inform the management. No resulp so far.
The joke was that when we got home there was a phone message sent on Saturday,while we in the hotel, to tell us about the meal times!",2,2010,02,08
218,what happened to this hotel what a shame,"i got married in killashee six years ago
at the time the place itself was amazing ,the staff were great ,the hotel itself was beautiful
my wife and i decided to go back and stay for two nights
before we went my wife tried to book treatments in the spa but nobody answered the phone
tried to book through the hotel but they insisted that she must make appointment through the spa so she just left it as nobody seems to answer calls {we should have known then}
the place itself has since been revamped and has the look  of a tacky cheap hotel in Egypt....its vile
when we arrived we had food in their lobby which i can only describe as over priced muck...we complained but got no where
when we went to reception they didn't  have us booked into their system and didn't seem to care either
the staff were extremely rude and seemed to  have no interest in us , they were only interested in chatting to each other so we left {the staff didn't seem too bothered about this} and went to the ospery in naas who were happy to have us
i complained but got no where
i asked to speak to a manager and was told there was nobody available even though the hotel  itself seemed very quite
i later phoned the hotel to speak to a manager and was told there was no one available and that they would call me back which never happened
i wrote a letter to management and received no reply
i have never felt so compelled to write a letter of complaint on tripadvisor before 
if management had at least acknowledged our complaint i would feel different
i understand everywhere that there good and bad days but this was just a joke
i believe it is under new management {what management ?}
what a shame this place used to be great",1,2010,01,21
218,Complete wow factor,"Excellent! I stayed for 2 nights and wished I could have stayed much longer. My cousin had her reception there and I have to say it was outstanding. The staff were so friendly and the manor house itself was enchanting, full of history that the hotel have displayed through out the hotel. The food received at the wedding was fantastic and considering that they were catering for 185 it was 100% quality.  

The leisure centre is well equited with a fine size pool and 2 saunas,2steam rooms and 2 jacuzzi. I didn't use the gym but it did look impressive. I didn't get a chance to use the Spa but I would consider returning for a girlie weekend. 

The weather wasn't great when we stayed but the gardens did look extremely beautiful and well kept. 

The only complaint I would have is regarding the drink prices in the hotel bar 'Jacks', they were extremely expensive and not value for money.",5,2009,10,29
218,Poor attention to detail and poor service,"We booked in for an evening this bank holiday weekend. 

The good:
The staff in the restaurant are excellent and the food in the restaurant was really great value for money. I would recommend the restaurant. 

The bad:
a) The hotel is scattered and to get to the room we had to ascend stairs, take a lift down a flight of stairs before finding the corridor our room was on
b) The spa in the hotel is miles away and they have no sign posting to the spa. The weather was poor and they do not give guests robes so they can cover up going to and from the hotel. My partner gave up looking for the spa after five minutes in the rain yesterday and was thoroughly deflated. The staff at reception could not have been less interested if they tried.
c) I wanted to watch the rugby in the bar - big local game going on. Instead they had an obscure english soccer game on ahead of the rugby and couldn't split the feed. I got a taxi to Naas, watched the rugby there. Inconvenient but tolerable only for the fact that my partner saw they had switched over to rugby after about 20 minutes of the rugby game despite my asking whether they would their saying the would not. 
d) When having lunch in the bar outside in the smoking are the were glasses left out that were clearly from friday night (it was two in the afternoon and they were all shot glasses). 
e) The staff in the bar take more interest in cleaning up the place consistently than in serving customers. Between 10 and 12 o'clock on Saturday night I queued three times for drinks in the bar for in excess of five minutes. On each occasion there were three people behind the bar but only one person actually serving customers. 
g) The room looked out onto a ladder and unfinished building works
h) The website does not make clear that the hotel is a family friendly location. That is completely fine obviously - I like kids - but we would likely have gone elsewhere had we known that it nurtures that market as it was a weekend getaway for two busy people looking for some peace and quiet

It is on grounds with good potential and the restaurant is a lovely room and good quality but the whole operation really did not add up for me. Really, really uneven service and just a lack of empathy that was doubly emphasized by chasmic difference in ability demonstrated by the people in restaurant versus the hotel reception and the bar. 

The situation my partner was put through in relation to the spa was a disgrace.",1,2009,10,25
218,"Helpful staff, but lacks sparkle","This was a one night business trip - stayed at Killashee as Lawlors and Osprey fully booked up due to horse sales.

Staff are all most helpful - even allowing me to use their ""backstage"" computer to check in for a flight when the single PC in th eBusiness Centre was occupied.

Rooms are quite large and bathrooms are huge. The photos elsewhere on this review really do give a clear impression of what you will get. Cleanliness of my room was a bit dubious - one or two small cobwebs in bedroom and bathroom floor looked like it had missed being mopped. Not a dirty room by any means - just got the impression the housekeeping staff are run off thier feet and cut a few corners perhaps.

The walk to the rooms from reception is long and may involve going up some stairs to go down others. Not too much of an issue for me, but if you are elderly or of limited mobility it would be worth asking if they have any rooms closer to reception.

Please note that Turners Restaurant is not open for evening meals on weekdays - it's bar meals only. That said, the meal I had in the bar was excellent, witha good range of meals, fairly good value for money and service was prompt and courteous without feeling like I was being watched like a hawk!

I have to agree with one of the previous reports that the interior decor is a bit dull. Not necessarily dated, as the condition of decor seemed very good - maybe the interior designer was feeling depressed at the time, I just don't know.

Breakfast was acceptable, but nothing to write home about - service a little slow. Staff spent more time clearing tables than seating guests - they were struggling to multi-task.

Overall experience was positive and I would stay there again as an overnight stay - maybe not a place you would want to spend longer in.",3,2009,10,02
218,Ben Dunne Spa experience in a hotel that screamed of financial trouble...,"My husband and I decided to spend our 1st wedding anniversary in this hotel, based on a friend's recommendation. We had high expectations and we were awarded a complimentary upgrade of rooms, which made for a very positive start. With hindsight, I wonder if that was an apology in advance...

The hotel building is fabulous, however it does smack of hotel in financial difficulty in my opinion. The unfinished golf course - where it looks like the builders literally downed tools and left. The toilet roll in the bathroom was cheap and the tiles in our shower had quite a lot of visible mould/mildew. We got a free upgrade, so maybe I am being ungrateful???!!!

My main gripe is the hotel's ""Spa"". The Spa's pool facility was closed. We were not advised of this at the time of booking, nor when we went in for a look around on the Friday night after we arrived. In fact, the lady working allowed us to have a look at the pool and didnt say a word!

On the Saturday we dragged ourselves in from the sun and went into the Spa. There was confusion because we were both brough to the Spa's changing rooms, given our bathrobe and slippers and told to come back down to reception. The lady then brought us through the ""magic door"" into the leisure club. She advised us that the Spa pool was closed - something to do with the jets... and basically said ""off you go..."" into the seperate leisure club.

My husband and I found ourselves in the respective male and female changing rooms of the hotel's leisure club. We felt like idiots in our robe and slippers - no need - completely surplus to requirements! I entered the pool area and there was a children's birthday party. Don't get me wrong, I love kids, but it didnt quite add up to my expectations of a quiet, serene spa environment.

The steam room, sauna and jacussi were all located in the leisure facility. One of the 2 steam rooms was ""out of order"". We wondered if the closure of the 2nd steam room was a clever cost saving exercise. The steam room that was operational had very little steam. 

I went for my treatment in the Spa and advised that we were annoyed. We did not believe it equated to a Spa experience. It was agreed that I should have been informed that the spa pool was out of order, however they made no apologies for the fact that they dont have a steam room etc within their spa. I acknowledged that I should have checked that, but it's the first Spa I've been to that didnt have it. I am a member of one of Ben Dunne's gyms in Dublin and I could have stayed in Dublin for the same ""Spa"" experience. I would go as far to say that Ben Dunne's gym is superior! It certainly offers more value for money.

One final point - the hotel is a separate building to the Spa / Leisure club. You have to exit the hotel and walk through the carpark to gain access to these buildings. My husband and I took a walk after breakfast and noticed smashed glass, covering 2 car parking spaces, beside our car. I rang the hotel's reception at 12:25 to advise them of this. When we went for our ""Spa"" at 4pm - the glass was still there. I mentioned this to the manager of the Spa when I complained. But believe it or not, it was STILL there on Sunday when we were leaving! I was shocked at that. 

I emailed the hotel 2 days ago - and I made the point of telling the person in question that I was not seeking compensation but I wanted to vent my annoyance at being duped into believing we were going for a Spa experience. We should have been notified that the Spa was not in full working order upon booking. I havent heard back from the hotel. Not even an apology. My next action is to email the hotel and let them know they have a new review on Trip Advisor! 

Don't go here if you're after a good spa experience. A day pass for Ben Dunne's gym would be way cheaper - or look around at the other Spa hotels. There's plenty of them out there who offer a true spa experience!",3,2009,09,17
218,Excellent hotel - room are miles away!,"The hotel is excellent and the staff are absolutely brilliant.  We stayed for a family wedding and they couldn't have been more helpful.  It's just a shame the rooms are a ten minute journey from reception!  It might not sound like much, but when you have two small children and you are constantly making the trek back and forth, up and down stairs, it soon gets to you.",4,2009,09,16
218,Good value for money,"We spent a night in Kilashee house to celebrate our wedding anniversary. After reading previous reviews about the rooms being small, I upgraded over the phone to a suite. On arrival I noticed that there was 2 weddings on. That will tell you something about the size of the hotel - it's huge. We hardly noticed that there weddings going on as they are kept fairly private. The staff at the desk were friendly and one of the girls showed us to our room - a good walk but that wouldnt bother us. The suite was large with a separate sitting room, a twin sink, bath, separate shower, 2 tvs. The decoration was very old fashioned - a bit of a change from staying in modern hotels - but it was still nice ( and clean). A fruit basket was left in our room and a miad offered to turn the bed down - all nice little extras that make a difference.

The dinner in Turners was really nice- the staff there were excellent. My wife didnt want her desert and the manager said that she could get it sent to the room later on if she wanted. After the dinner we went to the bar where there was a really good singer playing the piano - he was briliant. The breakfast the next day was ok - the restaurant was really busy and you could see the staff were under serious pressure. 

We would normally get treatments done but one look at the pricelist turned us off. They really need to reduce the prices by 20-30%.",4,2009,09,06
218,Could not have done more to make our day special,We had our wedding here and found this to be an excellent hotel. Everything is very well organised and even our smallest needs were catered for perfectly.,5,2009,08,30
218,Disappointing - It didnt live up to its name,"We spent one night for a little getaway together.  Were looking forward to the spa facilities.  Room was a bit dark and stuffy, common areas of the hotel were not so clean and the 'spa' facilities were across the carpark.  We had to carry our towels out across a public carpark and then the facilities that greeted us were very much below any even 3 star hotel standard.  Our Jackie Skellys is much nicer and its a public pool. Resturaunt and food were nice and the bar downstairs had a good atmosphere.  I wouldnt recommend this hotel for a relaxing spa break though.",2,2009,08,27
218,Nightmare service - Never again,"I have just been to the Kilashee House this weekend for a leisure break with my girlfriend who I had brought away for her birthday. When we arrived we were greeted by reception who were extremely friendly and helpful, The girl was so helpful she had advised that there was a wedding on in the hotel and moved our room away from the wedding party which i felt was a nice touch. When we arrived at the room found it to be very clean spacious and everything you would expect on a stay. 

We were happy with everything and I had made reservations in the restaurant (Turners) and this is where the nightmare begins. we booked the table for 8.30 when we arrived we were seated promptly and the waiter came and asked us what bread would we have and poured a glass of water and left the menu's, we were left sitting for 40 MINUTES!!! before our order was taken even tried to catch the waiters attention  in the proceeding time, when the waiter took our order we ordered a bottle of wine and because we were waiting 40 minutes to order we thought it better to order main course and dessert   as we wanted to be able enjoy the music in the bar. our wine took another 30 Minutes to arrive. We had been sitting since 8.30 we didn't get the wine till 9.45.  We sat and chatted hoping that our food would come in the meantime we were tempted to leave at this stage I had called for the bill as it was 10.15 and nothing had arrived, the Assistant manager came over, I  explained the situation and that we had been waiting  so long and wanted to go elsewhere, he explained there was a back log in the kitchen and the food would be here shortly, he appeared to take plates off the waiter and bring them over. 

The meal was okay but not as good  as friends had said. 
We asked for the bill and were waiting for at least 40 minutes to get it when we were about to leave it arrived we did not order dessert as we feared we would be waiting forever.  My girlfriend was clearly upset and I was angry but tried to be as patient as I could be, so I paid €100 for a one course meal with wine even though it was not worth the cost.  We went to the bar and had two drinks the bar closed shortly after and we were back in the room early very disappointed.

Breakfast was delivered in the moring (as ordered came an hour before stated) I dont mean to sound picky here, but the waiter was so rude when he came in the room, the breakfast was poor and the yoghurt was suppose to be fruit youghurt but didnt resemble it and also was warm!!!! after the breakfast we decided enough was enough so we left early.

When we checked out the girl on reception was so nice and understanding and quite embarrassed at what had happened us she called the Assistant manager over who proceeded to tell us that a chef had called in sick and that there was a death in his family and that the wine waiter had also been sick. He as token gesture took the wine I had ordered to toast my girlfriend at the room off the bill but seemed not too concerned that a good night had been ruined and it would be an unforgettable birthday but not for the right reasons!!!!!!",1,2009,08,24
218,Dull decor,"Attended a family wedding at this hotel recently and stayed one night. Hotel is quiet impressive outside and lobby is pleasant but the decor is a bit outdated and needs a re vamp in my opinion. The bedrooms are large and generally good but not the best soundproofing compared to similar hotels. Also, the rooims need some sort of air conditioning, the room I stayed in was quite clammy despite the heating being turned off. The layout of the hotel is also a bit confusing and the directions to the rooms were poor. Finally, the breakfast was nice and service was good.",3,2009,08,22
218,"Rooms excellent, Service could be better, spa awalk across the carpark!","My partner and I spent a night here recently. Our room was very comfortable and the room was huge with an excellent en-suite. There was quite a trek to our room, up lift, down two corridors, down a lift, down a corridor! The hotel has had a few additions over the years as word got out. The main reception area is housed in a wonderful house and the gardens are amazing. We had dinner on one of the nights in Turner's which was very good on the most part, the dining room is beautiful and this is where a fantastic breakfast is served. Jacks is their bar where one can have a light lunch or dinner - very chic if a tad load due to lack of soft furnishings. The one drawback comes when you want to use the spa - one cannot get to it in bathrobe and slippers! A trawl across the car park brings you you to the spa and leisure centre. For a 4 star hotel one would expect not to have to wander outside to get to the spa - especially in an Irish summer! ;-)",4,2009,08,19
218,I'll be back again,"I and my partner came here a Christmas function and found the hotel to be wonderful.  There was a lovely atmosphere in the hotel.  The suite we stayed in was just great with lots of room.  Food was fantastic and the staffs were top notch.  

I will definitely be back.",5,2009,08,11
218,"Good for a wedding, not sure I would want to spend more than 1 night here","Was at a friend's wedding in Killashee House and it was a perfect setting for it.  Grounds are lovely, function room perfect, and food was delicious.

However, the layout of the hotel itself was a bit strange. You check in then go up a flight of stairs, and then get a lift back down to the floor your room is on.  The lift was out of order so for any of the older guests it was a struggle.

The room was lovely. We had an upgrade to a Classic room, as we found we could get the same rate on another hotel booking website.  Classic room had 1 bed, and a big bathroom with separate bath and shower.  Was a very comfortable bed!!  Breakfast was included and there was a good choice offered but service was very slow.

Was a fine hotel for a wedding but I wouldn't want to spend more than a night there. It's outside Naas town so a car is needed to go anywhere. Might be nice for a quiet weekend away",4,2009,07,19
218,Excellent  Venue,"I stayed in the Killashee House recently for a business stay & I was very impressed. I had never been in the Hotel before & I was so surprised with the high level of service & staff helpfulness. There was a queue when I checked in, I think there was a wedding in the Hotel that day, but I didn’t have to wait too long to be assisted. As I was standing at reception one of the ladies stepped around the front of the desk & started asking guests if they needed help, even though there was three behind the desk. She then spoke to me, when I told her I was waiting to check she said 'I'm sorry you will need to register at reception, but If you need to make dinner reservations or information on the Hotel I can assist you' She chatted about the Hotel facilities until I registered & when I was checked in she wished me a lovely stay. As I walked away I noticed she worked in Sales on her Badge, I think her name was Denise. I work as a Sales Director & if I had a team as good as that I would be very lucky. No wonder the Hotel seemed so busy!!. Well the rooms were beautiful, with big bathrooms & plenty of floor space. I had dinner in the Jack's bar, the food was great, the service & Guinness were great also. The only person that could relax a bit while they are in the bar is the bar manager, he seemed a little stressed & was very abrupt to the bar staff. Most of the tables around us were commenting on how loud he was. All in all a brilliant experience, I have not been to a function or conference in the hotel but if they treat their leisure guests as well as the corporate then I will look forward to attending one. 
Well worth a visit !!!!",5,2009,07,15
218,Good and Bad,"The purpose of our visit was to stay there after a concert in Punchestown. The staff were great and sorted us out with an early check in as we ate in Jacks Bar, the other hotel restaurant was closed. There was not enough seats and peole who were sitting having a drink were being asked to give up their seats for diners. the curry and the salad was very good.
When we came back a while later for a coffee there was nowhere to sit so we had to carry our coffee through reception to an outside area to drink them, we had to get milk and sugar off a table that people were eating at. The staff were very busy and friendly and really went out of their way to help us with everything.
The hotel manager spent the whole day sitting at a table in the bar observing so hopefully he can see how there is a need for more seating for diners and drinkers, the outside bar smoking area also had only seating for about 12 people.
The Room was very clean and comfortable but you would nearly need sat/nav to find it, we had to get a lift up to 3rd floor ,walk across to another building and get another lift back down to the floor we were on. 
Plenty of nice cobwebs in the corridor areas.
You can tell the gardens were fabalus once but have seen their best days.
This hotel is a 4 star hotel but if it slips any further it will end up being 3 star.
The bar stayed open late and the staff  there were also very quick and friendly",3,2009,06,29
218,"Nice, Peaceful setting, Lovely rooms..","Just came back from a 2 night break -- enjoyed our stay, rooms are clean + pretty. Breakfast was very organised and was good. Dinner in Nun's Kitchen was very tasty.. restaurant's closed during the week so they're just serving food in the bar. Beautiful garden and wood path for a stroll. The only thing I didn't like was the location.. came by taxi from Kildare station.. costed us €35. The idea was to stay in the hotel and chill-ax.. The hotel is lovely and we had such a fantastic time and they've a DVD player in the room and they've a good selection of DVD's so we watched and watched GREAT films the whole time. Staff in all areas were amazing. Defo recommendable especially for those whose got their own cars!",4,2009,06,26
218,Won't be going back,"Long awaited weekend break with my partner who had booked it, plenty of treatments booked in the spa.  Impressed by the look of hotel from outside and reception area, but not impressed by the long trek to our room.  First impression of hotel room was really disappointing, nothing luxurious about it, very dated, no bottled water, bathroom set up with towels for one person only, small window overlooking car park.  We got ready to go to the Spa, followed the directions opened door to find myself looking across a carpark (again) which I had to run across in the pouring rain.  I've had several spa breaks in Ireland but never had to travel outside to get to the spa.  It was just another disappointment.  I enjoyed the treatment and when I returned to our hotel room I decided the room wasn't an acceptable standard and rang reception.  A nice girl rang me back with an upgrade to a suite which I accepted.  Food wise - our meal in Turners was very nice but the service wasn't overly friendly.  Food in Nuns Kitchen was only satisfactory.  My treatments the following day in the spa were mostly disappointing, plenty of cold drinks to be had put no platters of fresh fruit or anything else to eat.  Between myself and my partner we had 6 treatments over the 2 night stay but I would say the spa was definitely not the best I've been too.  This is the first review I have ever written but I felt so disappointed by my weekend I had to express it.  Having gone through the brochures I was expecting a luxurious break but it was nowhere near luxurious.  We won't be going back.",2,2009,06,23
218,Wonderful wedding day,"We travelled back from New Zealand to get married in Naas, and are very glad we did.

Kilashee house hotel is an old converted boarding school with beautiful gardens, and provided a fairytale setting for our wedding day. The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful throughout, the food was excellent and we were very well looked after at every stage of the day.

Our wedding group was small, with only 12 guests, but they made as much fuss over us as they would have for a larger wedding, and we felt that they did an amazing job of taking care of our needs and ensuring the day was perfect.

Highly recommended!",5,2009,05,22
218,Love it,"I went here for a swim with a friend who is a member and I just want to say it's lovely. Had a nice lunch however salad was a little soggy.

Thumbs up in general",4,2009,05,18
218,superb wedding,"i was attending a wedding there in july and I have to say, it was really an experience, which i dont want to miss! check in was efficiently fast, the rooms(at least my one)was very nice and  had everything what i wanted in it!
The wedding itself was wonderful with very fast and friendly staff and it seems like it was well organised and there was still space for any late time changes!
had breakfast in the morning, which I will never forget as they really have everything what I could imagine on the buffet- even the ingredients for my fav cocktail, bloody marry!!!

all in all, wonderful stay, nice hotel and as what I could see also very nice SPA with a big indooor pool",4,2009,05,07
218,Very Pleasant Stay,"We deciced to stay in the Kilashee as their prices have been lowered. We were not disappointed, with excellent service at all times. We were upgraded on arrival, which was a very nice touch. The room was excellent except the TV was quite old and wasn't working very well. Also, the pool in the spa wasn't working - the jets etc were broken, which was also the case when I visited 3 months before. They should tell you this upon arrival. The dinner and breakfast were both excellent. I'd say the hotel is a good 4 star  and their prices are more reasonable these days.",4,2009,04,21
218,"Lovely staff, good food and good atmosphere","Very surprised to see some bad reviews about this hotel. We stayed for one night wiith our two children and had a lovely time. The room was comfortable, the food excellent (we ate in the Nun's kitchen) and the staff were uniformely pleasant and helpful. We also made great use of the spa and pool and borrowed a dvd player for the evening.",4,2009,03,10
218,Delusions of grandeur,"We booked a night here at the last minute to break up the drive to Dublin. On arrival we were very impressed with the grounds and the exterior of the hotel. The staff at the front desk were very pleasant and informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite ( we had booked a standard room). As you can imagine we had high hopes after hearing this. It was very difficult to locate our room, they aren't big on signs in this place! However eventually a nice lady from Househeeping helped us out. Despite being named the Broadfield suite it wasn't very large and had a chaise longue at the end of the bed.  It was in the orginal house and was very nicely decorated and had lovely antique style furniture. Bathroom was pretty small but had everything you need. We rang down for an iron and ironing board which was delivered promptly by housekeeping but both were extremely shabby and worn.
We were a little disappointed to hear that jeans were not allowed in Turners as that is all my partner had with him, it would have been helpful if this was mentioned on the website. Despite that we ate in the Nun's Kitchen which was fine, although a little cramped. The staff were pleasant but not all that knowledgeable and lacked basic skills when it came to waiting  a table such as opening the wine before bringing it to the table, not bringing milk and sugar with coffee. They had, however, perfected the art of racing about avoiding eye contact which meant we had to practically jump in front of them to get their attention! When I asked about gluten free options, they were very helpful and seemed to know what this meant but then my creme brulee dessert was brought out to me with two shortbread biscuits on top so my confidence was somewhat shaken.
When it came to checking out it felt very much like a conveyor belt. All in all this hotel has pretty rooms and lovely grounds but the staff could do with a refresher course and some more information on the facilities and their location wouldn't go amiss.",3,2009,03,03
218,Never staying,"My girlfriend and I decided to stay in Kilashee for Valentines day. We couldnt get a booking for the day ...itself so decided to go on the 13th (Friday the 13th as it happens) 

We arrived and the exterior was really nice...all good so far.

Check in staff were very pleasent and the porter chatted about the hotel as he lead us to our room. 

Our room very small and basic- old style tv, sub par bathroom, and generally slightly run down looking (not in an old world way!)

We were so disappointed with the room, I called front desk and very nicely outlined our feelings about the room. The girl on front desk, kindly offered us a free upgrade and we were delighted. 

Our porter arrived at our room to take the bags to the next- he was clearly very annoyed with us and raced ahead with the bags and we had to almost run to keep up with him. 

We got to the next room and it was almost exactly the same as the first, the porter said we can stay here or go back to the first room and his manner was now rude. 

Being Irish we initally said the room was fine and as soon as he left, we had a chat about it and decided to leave the hotel. We packed our bags and left. Had a quick chat to the girl on front desk, who offered to call a manager but at this stage after making a fuss about changing rooms- we decided just to go. 

For the price of the rooms, this place is terrable value for money.
The rooms are comparable a room in Bewleys.

If your looking for anything, but a pit-stop break on your journey to somewhere decent, avoid.

The place has no atmosphere and was really quite for, what I would have assumed would be a busy weekend.",1,2009,02,14
218,Disappointing!,"A first visit for myself & my husband to this beautiful old boarding school renovated and now a lovely hotel with spa, gym & pool.

An arranged surprise birthday for a family member and everyone looking forward to the evening.  There were 23 in our group and after a champagne reception in the suite of the birthday guy a we had a table booked for dinner at 8pm as pre arranged with the hotel.
The orders were taken and the atmosphere in the restraunt was great.  Lots of other people including another large party.
The starters were served and I suppose we should have guessed at that time how this evening was panning out! some of us were finished before others started.  The main meals came out in tribs&trabs and by the time they served the plates to the table the food was COLD! and had to be sent back, veg plates were forgotton at one end of the table and when the rest of us got the veg it too was COLD! We complained at the time and food was taken back and replaced evenutally with hot dishes by which time some of the guests were now having their desserts.  Quite a mixed arrangement.  The manager then left a bottle of white & red wine & apologised for the inconvenience- that was between 23 people, (I must add myself&my partner were not drinking wine)
We were disappointed&this was discussed between people at the table but we left it at that till next morning.
Next morning I went to pay my bill which amounted to €260.00 for 2 people sharing with evening meal.  I did say to the girl at reception I was very disappointed over the meal, she apologised and took the money & then she called over the duty manager who took me aside to ask me what happened, I explained our complaint and he said they took very seriously any guest complaints and apoligised and said since I had paid my bill there wasnt anything he could now but hoped we would come back again.  I went back to the rest of the group who by then had paid and complained.  I must point out at this time no one got a reduction on their bill.  Each couple were offered different things, some an upgrade if they came back, some nothing at all, there was no consistency to their handling of the mishap from the previous evening, so they were not out of pocket nor were they offering any real explaination to the group of 23 who paid €180.00 each for 1 night B&B and evening meal that was cold!
The duty manager I had spoken to earlier came back over to me while I was with the rest of the group and said to me I never told him that wine was offered at the table & an apology & I should be grateful for that to which I pointed out to him, I wasnt drinking wine at the table so it didnt make a difference to me, we are talking 2 bottles of wine here.  If the duty manager on the day had got the group together - apologised - and offered an upgrade to all in the group on their next visit and complimentry tea&coffee before we left it would have made a better inpression, it was handled very unprofessionally.
It put a little dampner on the evening.  I personally wont stay in this hotel again, I cant speak for the rest of the party, I can only say its a beautiful building with a lot of history, a nice hotel, very well presented and comfortable with great facilities, but a group of managers who need to look at just how its run!
Pity!

218,relaxing but room for improvement,"We stayed with a group of family/friends for relaxing weekend. Overall enjoyable but room for improvement
Check in- efficient with staff available to carry suitcase if required.
Room- bit of a maze to get to. You have to go up one floor in the lift, down a corridaor before going down a level again and then corridor to bedroom. There was a very mild smell of cigarettes in the corridor but even though the room had an ashtray there was no smell of smoke. 
Nuns kichen for informal meal the first night. food was lovely and efficient, couldnt fault them on that. We had however reserved a table for 4 and they placed us at a smallish table with extra chair added which partially blocked the passageway for some customers. 
Breakfast- lovely. Choice of cereal, cooked fry, pancakes,cheese ,cold meets- the usual. All good except burnt toast.
I had booked a few treatments in the spa for the next day, the treatments and staff were lovely but bit expensive for what it is. There is a lovely relaxation room with music, fruit etc etc.Was really disappointed as the pool was freezing- it is advertised as hydrotherapy but was too cold to stay in. Also some of the pool jacuzzi werent working. we werent told this when we checked in. I complained when leaving and eventually got a 20percent discount which was nice.
Afternoon tea- served on 3 tier tray: lovely treat of little sandwiches, cakes etc. Serves two but plenty for 3 people. dinner in the main restaurant was fab, really enjoyed it. Plenty of space between tables so not disturbed or disturbing others. Desserts abit disapointing. 
Only other thing is the lounge area upstairs that is normally for guests was taken over for wedding so we had to use restaurant for afternoon tea/drinks which is a bit disapointing.  Overall enjoyed the weekend- 2 big double comfy beds in the room with heavy curtains to block out the light.",4,2009,02,01
218,Disappointing visit,"We stayed here over New Year as a family. We had booked 3 rooms and we couldn't get out of the place fast enough. We know this hotel well as its close to where my family live. The last time we stayed was 6 years ago and the difference this time was unbelievable.

The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that the quality of the food was very good . We ordered two bottles of champagne on New years eve at €98 each and they were plonked on the table with no glasses or ice bucket. We ended up having to go to the bar for the glasses ourselves!

Room service breakfast was ordered and basic items such as butter was forgotten - they had to come back 3 times before they got it right!

I had made a reservation for the spa and had email confirmation but when I got there they had no record of my reservation and could not fit me in.

The open lounge area was cold (in temperature) and the bar staff simply rude when we tried to order a drink. We were told to hurry up as they were having a drinks reception later on and need the place clear. This was fine but we were not offered an alternative and as hotel guests we found this a bit odd.

The reception staff were indifferent t any requests we made and showed a general lack of interest.

The rooms themselves were fine, spacious enough (bathrooms were small enough but functional). There was no shower gel in my room and I had to chase after house keeping to get this!!  There was also no water and I was told there should have been. I ordered some from room service and was charged €5.00.

To add insult to injury we contacted the hotel when we left to advise them of our disappointment and to date they have not bothered to reply to our email or phone call. I find this astonishing and rude to say the least.

Needless to say we will not be returning.",1,2009,01,06
218,Romantic hideaway,I have recently stayed at the Killashee House Hotel in Naas.  I simply had to write and thank all the staff and highly recommend the hotel.  I am surprised how anyone would think this is anything but a magnificent spot for a luxurious break.  I actually heard about the hotel from a friend of mine who had recently been on a Spa break there.  She said that she had actually fallen asleep in the relaxation room it was that comfortable.  So on this recommendation I booked myself and my husband in on a special offer that I actually saw advertised to include complimentary afternoon tea.  Bliss….  That is the only word for it.  The hotel was busy but nothing was too much trouble for the helpful staff at Killashee. The only one thing I might add is that on checkout more staff may have shortened our waiting time - however that was not a big issue.  However that was probably down to the amount of guests checking out at the same time.  I would like to recommend this hotel for a relaxing break.,4,2008,11,19
218,WEDDING FACTORY,"Attended a family birthday on Saturday 8th of November 2008. Could not get parking as all carparks located near the front door of the Wedding Factory were full. Not concierge service available.

Check in was slow due to the volume of people checking in, guests of the two weddings in progress I presume.

Brides, Grooms and wedding parties are greeted by 3 advertisements at the front door offering special discounts on all weddings booked in the Wedding Factory that is Killashee House Hotel by the end of the year - how distasteful is that?

We were unable to utilise any of the common areas in the Wedding Factory as they were reserved for the various wedding parties, so we had to make do with the bar counter for lunch and lukewarm bottled beer. The bar was full, with one poor guy behind the bar.

The rooms were dark and suffering the effects of continuous weekend occupancy.

The leisure facilities are good but it is a work out in itself on reaching these facilities as they are a good ten minute walk from the reception desk.

Suffice to say, I won't be back. I advise all perspective brides and grooms to avoid this wedding factory and go elsewhere. I'm still awaiting a call from the manager after I complained. This wedding factory is overtrading and is definitely not a 4 star establishment.",1,2008,11,11
218,Great value for money,"Just back after a weekend down in Kildare.  Had a fab time in Killashee House Hotel.  Arrived on Friday evening tired and gumpy and was immediately put as ease with the pleasant reception staff and delightful porter Sanjev who showed us up to our room.  

The next day even though the weather was dire we had a good browse round the shops before I headed to the spa for some treatments which were WOW....  

Had dinner in the main restaurant which was fantastic, we had a very pleasant waiteress .  Found all the staff from beginning to end brilliant and can't wait to go back again, next time I'll leave the hubby at home and go for a girlie weekend, 

Would recommend to anyone..",5,2008,10,05
218,Fab hotel for a conference,"I recently attended a conference at Killashee House Hotel.  I can't rate it highly enough!  From the moment we arrived to the time we left they were so professional.  It’s the warmest of venues with a very romantic feel to the place!  I will be returning with my husband as soon as I can get someone to mind the kids!!  The food was divine and I was glad that our conference was an overnighter. We were so impressed, especially with the restaurant staff, I have a boss who is difficult to impress at the best of times!!  He too was raving about the service.  I didn’t get the chance to use the Spa but am planning a return visit before Christmas!  A stunning hotel.",5,2008,09,30
218,Definately not 4* service,"Attended a conference here in September and was bitterly disappointed. The service was no where near 4* and was possibly the worst I have experienced in a long, long time.  From the moment we arrived we were met by inexperienced kids. Check-in was so slow and there was no porter to bring in luggage or bring us to our rooms, which were extremely difficult to find. The food was OK but unexciting. Service during lunch was very poor. There was no milk on the tables and by the time we received it, the tea was cold. Dinner was bland and again the service was not 4*. Again service at breakfast was dreadful. Basic things like salt and pepper or butter were not readily available and staff were inexperienced and rude. There didn't seem to be a manager in sight during our stay. This was in complete contrast to last years conference which was held in Laois. The property itself  was nice, bedrooms well decorated and very clean. Parts of the lesiure centre are in very bad repair. THe ladies toilets have tiles missing off the walls and ceiling. But this is the only area were staff were friendly.",1,2008,09,27
218,Married in Killashee,"I'm probably a bit biased with this review seeing as I got married here and being the happiest day of my life I would have been happy staying in a garden shed.. However I review purely the stay and not the wedding, which was incredible by the way. 
I stayed in the Bell Tower suite in the original house and did manage to visit the other 11 suites in the house prior to this stay. The original house is decked out in a very tasteful, old world charm type of decor and is just crammed with antique furniture. The bell tower suite is a very comfortable & decent sized suite. The room was immaculately clean and just oozed charm making it a delightful place to be. 
The only draw back from the original house is that there are no elevators, so not suitable for though with mobility issues. All 12 suites are unique with the own quirks and décor but all delightful rooms. My family stayed in these room and all were very happy.
The staff in the Killashee was a delight to deal with, they were all very pleasant and professional at all times I dealt with them. 
The Chef in the killashee is outstanding, each of the nights I dined there, there was no slip in quality and I can not rave enough about it. I ate in the main resturaunt, the Nun’s kitchen bar and the lunch area, all were of superior quality. By the way the best value and most generous portions of afternoon tea can be found here.
Finally when the Killashee grounds are in full bloom it surely is a sight to see. The landscaped areas are pristine and very relaxing. I recommend a stroll down as far as the Nun’s graveyard.",5,2008,09,05
218,"Great potential, but food service is lacking","We selected the Killashee House Hotel and Spa outside of Naas (pronounced ""Nace"") as a place to recover following our arrival from the U.S. in Ireland.  We were attracted to the description of its 80 acre estate, its lovely appearance and the fact that it had a spa.  Unfortunately, lackluster food and inattentive restaurant and pub staff really marred the experience.  I don't recommend it.  As for the 80 acres, most of it is fenced and not available for walking.  The formal garden is lovely, but small.  The dining room and pub are attractive but here's an example of the service:  noting that there were tables outside the pub (on ground level - the pub is actually in the basement), I asked the service person if lunch was available outside.  She shrugged and said, ""If you like.""  Killashee is one of the places in Ireland that has staff who are mostly guest workers or recent immigrants.  In the dining room, we almost had to run up a flag to order the next course, request wine, etc.  Meanwhile, one staff member spent almost the entire time shuffling something in a food service station, while two staff members chatted at the bar.  One got the feeling that they viewed actual waiting on tables as someone else's job.  There are exceptions - like Anna, who tended the upstairs tea/bar area the afternoon we arrived.  The Reception staff is also great, and the manager welcomed feedback.  The spa is the high point.  On the outside, it captures the style of the 19th century country lodge; inside, the gym features loads of athletic equipment and an olympic pool.  Guests are welcome to participate in classes; I loved the aqua aerobics taught by Clare.  The spa is also first rate; especially good was the deep tissue massage by Dolores.  Overall... there are probably better places to rest and recover.",2,2008,08,25
218,Relaxing retreat,"Stayed here for 2 nights to attend a family wedding.  This is a former convent and boarding school with beautiful grounds and even a little nuns graveyard on site! Magnificent building and you get a real wow factor when you go inside. Rooms very spacious and comfortable.  The Nuns kitchen bar is lovely, really good atmosphere and we had a traditional irish music band playing.  Food in the bar was gorgeous - i recommend the fish and chips and mushy peas!  I agree with previous comments made about the breakfast - we got in just in time before 10 before the queues formed but i think its a case of most guests leaving it to the last half hour!!  Breakfast really good though.  Next day wedding was amazing - food lovely especially fillet of beef.  Hotel is so big that weddings should not interfere with other guests' enjoyment - i certainly would go back.  We never left in the 2 days we were there - a real retreat.",4,2008,08,14
218,Lovely!,"We decided to treat ourselves & get away from it all & we are so glad we did! Having read some mixed reviews we were a little nervous but the place is really lovely. Our room wasn't ready so we got instantly upgraded - a good start! The atmosphere was relaxed but service was excellent everywhere. Check - in was friendly & quick. We ate in Turners - the room is beautiful, food very good & service top notch.

Some reviews have mentioned weddings & there was one on the day we went. Wedding guests seemed to be off in a reserved area & didn't particularly affect us - certainly no more than any other hotel we've stayed in. It was no more geared to this than some hotels we've experienced being geared to golfers, for instance.

The bar had trad music on that evening, which was a nice touch & breakfast the next day was again very good, though busy after 10am.

We will definitely be back!",5,2008,07,20
218,A Wedding Factory.....!,"Ireland = 4 seasons in one day ... this place = 2 or 3 brides / weddings in one day...... nightmare.  

This place is what it is, one big non stop Wedding machine.  If your going to a wedding there with a crowd of friends and family then I suppose it is as good a place as anywhere.  The grounds etc are nice for a photo and the setting isnt bad.  However if your name isnt on the Wedding list then dont go in........

The so called 'fine dining' food is production line and cant be masked by the excellent service.  If you like your fish cooked to the point were it could be used to resole your shoe then go ahead.  The dining room is a great setting and the Harpist certainly adds a bit of atmosphere... however the quality of the food lets the place down big time.  

The hotel itself is a good 3 / 4 star hotel but is clearly one which relys on the commercial business of 21st centuary Weddings.  Big, bold and brash.  Sorry if you had your wedding here - Im sure it was great but horses for courses, but those who arent going to an event should be warned!",3,2008,07,15
218,nice but very unfriendly staff,"i have just returned from a 2 night stay at kilashee house i was attending the races at the curragh and wanted somewhere nice and comfortable to stay. the hotel itself is beautiful the grounds are stunning  for a wedding. over all the stay was good except for some extremly rude staff the night porter even grunted at us, on the other hand the staff in the nuns kitchen bar were nice. but i did find a pair of mens socks in my room on arrival.
but over all my experience at kilashee was enjoyable",3,2008,07,02
218,Great Hotel,"Stayed in the Killashee House Hotel for one night in June with my partner.  Having read some bad reviews on trip advisor was a bit dubious about staying to be honest!  However, we were pleasantly surprised.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Hotel itself is a beautiful old boarding school which has been restored.  Grounds were gorgeous.  We didn't get time to use the villa spa but it looked great.  Only problem is the rooms are a bit off the beaten track ie we had to take two flights of stairs and then a lift back down one floor to reach ours!  We'll definitely go back and stay a little longer next time.",4,2008,06,09
218,Wedding,"We stayed in Killahsee House Hotel for a wedding in April 2008.

We had stayed in this hotel a couple of years of go and its was amazing, but im afraid it has gone a little downhill since then.

The food was ok, a bit cold and the servers were sloppy and didnt seem to know what they were doing at all. Service was slow.

The wedding itself was great, but for the price of Killahsee we feel you could do better ie the K Club or Carton House.

Def not 4 star im afriad.",2,2008,04,11
218,"Poor Food, cold showers","My wife and I stayed at this hotel for the second time in april this year and I was surprised how it was disimproved.
On thesurface the hotel is lovely and the staff are great.
But the quality of food in the restaurant was terrible. i couldn't even cut my fillet steak with a knife let alone chew it. My wife had fish that was totally overcooked. For an expensive restaurant (our bill came to 160 euro) I thought it was terrible.

The room was lovely but there was no hot water in the hotel (cold showers).

Overall the one night stay we had came to 400 euro. You could do much better at carton house or even the k club fo that money.",2,2008,04,04
218,Not so relaxing,"Just back from what should have been a relaxing break at Killashee with a friend. Staff friendly, room great but relaxing....not. After a lovely dinner and a night cap we retired to our room for what we had hoped would be a relaxing sleep. Instead we lay awake listening to other guests of the hotel running up and down corridors singing and shouting. Wedding goers I believe. I would not recommend this hotel for a relaxing stay. Following morning we arrived for breakfast at 10.15 and having queued for 15 minutes to be seated we were served our very disappointing breakfast at about 11.15. I sent an email expressing my disappointment and nobody replied. I won't be back.",3,2008,03,10
218,"Lovely hotel, spa disappointing","I booked a weekend spa break for myself & 2 friends and we were all really looking forward to some relaxation!!!
Check in was fine, quick & pleasant staff. Room was lovely - but needed to ring down for 3rd set of towels. Spa is a bit of a walk away - too far and awkward for a 'spa hotel' in my view. Smell coming from showers/toilet/sinks in changing rooms - not very nice! Treatments nice but overpriced. Deluxe Pedicure was €80 and involved very little if any massage or relaxation (bright room sitting in a noisy chair!). I've had nicer treatments elsewhere for less. Food in the restaurant nice but nothing amazing. Nuns bar was lovely but very small (food was great though). Breakfast was very disappointing. Certainly not 4 star quality.
On returning home we realised we hadn't been charged for all treatments so I informed the hotel. I received a copy of my transaction in the post - but no thank you! (they had undercharged by €280!). This is a really lovely hotel in lovely surroundings but I think the spa was an afterthought and it comes across as such. It also needs a bit of work on the grounds but should be beautiful when finished.
One my friends would go back but I think there are far nicer spa hotels for the same price...",3,2008,03,06
218,Nice hotel but odd layout,"Stayed here overnight to attend a function in the hotel.

Check-in was smooth and the reception staff very helpful. The room itself was lovely and comfortable though getting there was a bit of a trek... had to go up stairs/lift, walk down a long corridor and then go down in another lift to get to the floor my room was on. 

We hadn't realised that the function room was at the back of the hotel so it was another (disappointing) trek to room, going outside and round the back in formal dress and high heels in gale force winds, rain and across an uneven surface with cars speeding past us in their driveway, having to avoid splashes.

The food was tasty and the staff attentive at the function. Only one heater outside for those of us who still smoke so could do with another heater or smoking area.

Had a lovely sleep in a very comfortable bed and room. Bathroom was lovely also and so warm. Slept so well I didn't get up for breakfast and it was great, and unusual, not to be woken up by noise of cleaning staff in the corridors until after 10am, very unusual nowadays and a pleasant end to the stay.

Check out was as smooth as checking-in.

Would go back here again.",4,2007,12,02
218,Return visit - Just as special as I remembered!,"We stayed at this hotel for a 2 night weekend break while attending a friend’s wedding in October 2007. Congratulations Ian & Rachel!  This was a return trip for us as we had stayed in the Killashee House for Valentines weekend a couple of years ago and I had always wanted to return, but never got round to it!

We had a superior double room, bathrobes/slippers the works @ €180 B&B (wedding rate booked directly with hotel).   Room was really big, massive bed and the bathroom had a separate shower and bath.  Its just not the rooms that make this hotel, but the total ambience from when you drive up the long driveway to the gravel drop off point, to the bell boys waiting for you, helping you with your luggage!  This time round we ate in the Nun’s Kitchen down in the basement, food and service both excellent!  The last time we had ate in the main dining room, as it was a special occasion (Valentines) it was perfect, but a bit formal for what we wanted this time, so that’s why we opted for the cellar bar/restaurant.  Also they have a large screen in the cellar bar part showing all the matches so that kept hubby happy! 

The Spa – I visited the spa on the Sunday, I had only allotted myself 2hrs for my treatment and relaxation, but will know for again to allow far more! They have a lovely relaxation room with beds/water features, about 20 or so treatment rooms, juice bar, hydro pool…you could have easily spent all day in the Spa!  I didn’t want to leave, only we had planned to go to the races at Naas racecourse which was 10mins drive away.  The Spa is in a separate building next to the swimming pool/country club, just a short walk across the car park. 

The hotel grounds are just lovely for a walk, the old part of the hotel used to be a convent and then they put extensions on.  I was very impressed with the service we received while attending the wedding and the wedding meal itself was gorgeous!  Overall great hotel in a lovely setting with a fab Spa!  Enjoy!",5,2007,11,09
218,"Ok, But needs updating","This looks like a great grand hotel from the outside, yet inside it is dark and dingey. The standard restraunt is in a 'cave' on lower ground floor, althought they were going for atmosphere, it just felt cold and enclosed. The leisure facilities were again ok, but in need of modernisation. The rooms are quite big, but the large over powering furniture makes them feel small. I would not recommend this hotel if you dont like darkness, however if you like victorian style properties it s good.",2,2007,10,27
218,Beautiful Hotel and Grounds,"Stayed here for one night while attending a wedding at the hotel. It really is a beautiful venue. The grounds, the bar, lobby, reception, the old house are all lovely. The food was great, the service was good, but i think some of the waiting staff were very new and nervous.
The room was a good size with a fab bathroom. Would recommend it, although it seems to be overun with weddings so if you weren't part of the wedding party you might feel a bit out of place.

218,Disappointing,"We had our wedding reception in Killashee House last summer.  My husband rang to book a table for dinner for our wedding anniversary and was told the restaurant was fully booked for the evening requested and was asked if he could change the date!  Our bridesmaid then tried again to book a table for 4 for the same evening.  She explained it was our wedding anniversary etc..and was told that someone would call her back.  The date came and went and nobody even contacted her.  This was very disappointing treatment for our 1st wedding anniversary.  We did not want any special treatment but it would have been nice if somebody had even got back to us with a definite reply.
",2,2007,08,28
218,Highlights and Lowlights,"I have just returned from attending my brother's wedding at this hotel and I have to say that it is a hotel that will definitely linger in your memory as it is so unique.
I stayed for two nights..first night I was in a standard double room in the more recently built part of the hotel. It was a great size with lovely furniture, two great big 5 foot beds and a lovely bathroom. 
We were a long walk from reception but the room was lovely and apart from a shower that was built for a 9 foot giant (the outlet was way up the wall so I could hardly reach it)...I couldn't fault the room. 
The second night, I was fortunate to stay in one of the suites in the old part of the hotel and that was amazing. These old rooms were once the living quarters of the nuns who lived here when it was a boarding school and they have been restored to their former glory when the house was a private dwelling and are gorgeous.
Because all of the wedding party was staying in this part of the hotel, I got to see about 7 of these suites and they were all charming in their own way, amazing antique furniture and cute quirky windows and spaces....from the bell tower at the top of the hotel to the bathrooms with original tiled floors to the sash windows overlooking the lovely gardens.
The lowlights for me were that the hotel is lacking a little in the maintenance side. There are just the small things......like windows that don't shut right,  wallpaper peeling in the room, general untidiness in the grounds. But not enough to stop me revisiting. The other lowlight is that it is a noisy hotel. There were 3 weddings and a business function over the two nights we stayed and both nights people in our party had disturbed sleep because of noise from the functions. Obviously we were part of the problem the second night as we were one of the weddings! But I would say that if you are booking one of the suites in the old part of the hotel, and there is a wedding or a function on, ask for the top floor suites. Oh, and by the way, this old part of the hotel is not suitable for visitors with disabilities as there are no lifts...we all got plenty of exercise on the charming original staircases! Final lowlight was the efficient but not so friendly reception staff. It would have made it so special if they were a bit more customer-focussed. I understand though that the wedding co-ordinators are fantastic and my brother and sister in law were blown away by how well their wedding was organised.
All in all, a completely memorable stay in a unique hotel.
",4,2007,08,11
218,Wonderful atmosphere in old Manor...,"We stayed here in july this year, on the last night of our Ireland holiday. 

Firstly I must say that had I known what expected us I would have booked two nights here, instead of two nights at Heatons Guesthouse in Dingle... In a heartbeat!!!!! 

Here we were so lucky that we got upgraded to a Junior Suite and had an excellent 3 course dinner (5 courses with the extras) - all for the total prize of 300 Euros!!!!! (check their internetpage)...

First we came to the little town of Naas, and thanks to our GPS we found the hotel at once... The first glimpse was a Manor estate with an avenue up to the hotel... So our expectations were quite high before we entered, because it seemed very classy, historic, and the ""princess"" in me, as in all girls, was anxious to experience the place... 

Entering the large hall and receptionarea was lovely since we entered upon a fairytalewedding with guests mingeling in the Courtyard, and the ""princess"" in me got more courious... The atmosphere of the actual Manorhouse was very very nice, sort of intimate as well as stately!!! We loved it! The service was nice, we got upgraded, and there was a Porter who took our luggage to our room (no. 329). The room was REALLY nice, very clean and really large, and with the intimiate sort of french in the eighteenhoundreds maximalistic style... If you see what I mean??? Really exclusive and nice and intimate! They had even put small poems on the bead, and also a handwritten weatherforecast for the next day... 

There also was a beautiful spa-area, however we didn't have time to try that out... 

But, we had booked the included dinner... Normally we NEVER eat at the place we stay at, but here it was after all included in the pacage... I was sceptical for two reasons. One is the sometimes not so genuine / uninspired sort of food they sometimes serve in larger hotels, and the other was that I was courious about what sort of servicelevel the place had, especially since the dinner was a ""package"" one...

The diningroom was very nice, and we were seated by the wondow with a lovely view to the gardens. Small rabbits jumped around and made it an enjoyable start to the evening. 

Firstly: we could not give enough praise to the waiters!!!! First the one who put the cloth napkins on our knees (good start), to the excellent Sommelier who really came through on his recommendations (we had a magnificent Chablis to the lobster, scallop and seafood maincourse), to André who was almost too much of himself... Excellent service, really one of the top two we have ever experienced, and the food and wine met all our expectations! And there was a lot of food as well! And the lobster and the scallops were of wonderful quality! And that comes from  from Norway (which in practicality is one big coastline with very good fish and seafood... ) So we were very impressed by the quality and servicelevel, especially when we got our cofee and cognac served outside in the gardens, even after they had closed the restaurant... 

So... No more words; if you want to feel like a princess follow me... :-)

218,Four poster beds are class,"Booking the hotel was as easy as A B C and there web site gives you excellent directions to follow to arrive in a calm state. From the moment you turn into the grand winding driveway up to the hotel you realise this is going to be an experience and we were not disappointed. Parking our car in one of the many car parks we made our way to the large reception to be greeted by a cheery receptionist who was very helpful. We had arrived in the morning and check in is in the afternoon she did some clicking around on the computer and we ended up with an upgrade to a wonderful suite with a drawing room complete with a chandelier, stereo, big comfortable sofa, arm chairs and a large enclosed book case complete with books. and a four poster bed. The bedroom was a dream with a four poster bed, a large screen t v with a DVD player (which there are many DVDs to borrow from the reception) a  enormous wardrobe complete with a safe. Each room comes with two white fluffy towel robes and slippers. The bath room soaps etc are all Molten Brown and soft large bath towels such is the quality of this hotel.
Breakfast  which can be ordered to your room but it is much better to go to the dining room where you have a choice of fresh fruit juice, cereal, hams, cheese, fruit, yogurt and of course your choice of cooked breakfasts (the full Irish sets you up for the day) all this and a friendly face to serve you. Afternoon tea is available up stairs in the residents lounge. Complimentary tea and coffee  can be ordered to your room at any time during your stay. The evening meal was an adventure in itself. The menu is varied and a total experience. The starters were a wonderful collection of ideas and for main course I had the steak which was so succulent it melted in your mouth and my wife had Sturgeon complete with caviar and the deserts were just unbelievable. The menu was obviously put together by a first class chef and the presentation and cooking by an equally first class team. This kitchen really knows how to satisfy the palate it was truly a first class experience. Visit the Nuns kitchen in the basement for drinks where food is also served and another varied menu bistro style. After this delight with food why not go for a walk around the estate gardens for exercise there are many varied plants and pathways to explore. The villa spa which is part of the hotel has a swimming pool, a hydrotherapy pool, hair salon and so many kinds of massages etc be pampered  in opulent surroundings. 
We cant wait to return to this hotel they have got the right staff the perfect setting and it is very customer friendly. Go and stay there you deserve it and you will definitely love it.

218,Fabulous,"Stayed here for my friends wedding. It was fab. There were no rooms left - so we got a suite, amazing room and bathroom off it, there was also a separate room for ironing or whatever! It was really nice. The hotel has lovely grounds and overall a great standard. 
O and the wedding was great too!",5,2007,05,25
218,A map would be helpful!!!!,"Arrived with a large group for an overnight stay with dinner.  Check in was quick and efficient but not very welcoming.  Foyer is lovely, with a large seating area and nice views into the courtyard.  We were directed to our rooms, but we should have been paying more attention.  This place is huge and our passage to our rooms was up flights of stairs, through a large lounge area and then only accessable via a single lift.  As some of our friends were on other floors, we spent a lot of the first few hours of our stay rambling the endless coridoors trying to find each other.  Because of the large group, this was mostly hysterical, but definitely not for those with walking difficulties, and don't get me started on trying to find our way to the leisure centre and spa! 

Rooms, when found were very nicely furnished, a good size and very clean.  Lighting very dim and no tea and coffee making facilities would be a problem. Although you could order tea from reception free of charge, this was a slow process and seemed unnecessary.  Overall however the rooms were very pleasant and the beds large and comfortable.

Food in the turner restaurant was very good and very well served.  The dining room is beautiful.  After dinner we spent the rest of the evening in the upstairs lounge, which is very roomy and was great until the remains of a very large wedding arrived.  This is a very big and busy hotel and definitely not for those looking for a quiet weekend retreat , which luckily we were not .
Would not hesitate to return (But with a compass)
",4,2007,05,16
218,Relaxing,"Stayed here for a two night break, one dinner and a spa treatment for two people...

Check in...fairly efficient, but not very friendly or welcoming, which is a pity, cos it instantly put me in bad form. every other member of staff I met after that were very friendly and pleasant.. and will go out of there way to help you.

Room...an ok size...far too much big furniture for the size of the room, had to do a bit of re-arranging when I got there first, but the bed was very comfy, the room was clean and warm...bathroom was a decent size, good selection of  toiletries, separate shower.
I ordered coffee to the room, which you have to do... as there are no tea/coffee making facilities, its free of charge and arrived very promptly.

Dinner in Turners...had dinner there on both nights..first night was Good Friday...both of us had fish, his was fine...mine was very bland and dry...chef has a thing for tomatoes, they are served with everything, maybe they had loads left over on that weekend, who knows
Saturdays nights dinner fared better, the steak was lovely as was my other half's lamb...very tasty... 
one thing about the dinners...take everything they give you including the bread...the portion sizes are small...but surprisingly, you will be full at the end of it all. again staff there lovely, one lady especially the Friday evening showed us to our table and she was very helpful.

Breakfast...absolutely lovely...lots of choice, you wont be disappointed

Villa Sap and the leisure centre....one word ""Bliss""...both of us had a massage and it was brilliant...I was very sorry I didn't book other treatments in advance cos they were totally booked out...the relaxation room is the nicest I have seen...pool sauna steam room no fault there either...there is also a hairdressers next door...

Check out...slow enough, but loads of people checking out at the same time...the girl this time was lovely...chatty and nice...dont know her name, but she worked in the Nuremore in Carrickmacross before this hotel..

Overall....I would recommend the hotel, although it is a bit pricey...was a very relaxing weekend

218,Bit of a dump,"No cold water from taps, extractor fan not working, stained ceiling, grubby bed-spreads, unbelievably rude staff, badly serviced, will not be going back.

218,Highly reccommended,"Just back from a girls break at the Killashee. It was fantastic and we could not find fault. A magnificent building, with great character set in beautiful surroundings. We ate in Turners Restaurant, where the food was superb and the atmosphere was great. The Nun's Kitchen bar was warm, friendly and buzzing.A great place to relax after dinner. Our package included a spa treatment. The Villa Spa was out of this world,we each had a massage and then went to their relaxation room, which was heaven. The staff at the Spa could not do enough to make us welcome. We were treated like royalty and constantly offered fresh juices,herbal teas, extra cushions... What a tough life !
The same could be said of the hotel staff, friendly and efficient despite the fact that they were incredibly busy with a wedding and a gala ball.
Killashee House is a wonderful retreat, just park the car, deposit your bag and enjoy all they have to offer.",5,2007,03,25
218,Exspensive but well worth it.,"We stayed here for 3 nights. This place has some nice gardens, and very nice surrounding area. The Inn is magnificent and we had experienced very good service. I will up load photos a later date. But if your looking to relax, and be waited on like a kink this is the place.
Enjoy....

218,Not too impressed,"Stayed for two nights in this hotel.  On arrival I had three bags. First hurdle was to get suitcase through the gravel at the front of the hotel, not at all suitable for suitcases with wheels. Checkin was efficient if even a little unfriendly. Was directed to the stairs (with my three pieces of luggage!) No one around to help and no offers forthcoming, I asked to be directed to a lift which I was, had to take lift to third floor, walk a number of seemingly endless corridors only to have to get another lift down to the first floor to find my room. By the time I got to my room I had decided never to take so much luggage with me anywhere in the future and never to stay in Killashee again! After that I have to say my stay improved.  Room was nice, not too big but had everything one needs.  Tea/coffee facilities available on room service only which seemed a waste of resources, particularly when I ordered tea and a newspaper, I was promptly told "" I bring tea only, no newspapers "" Fine!  Food in the evenings very good. I ordered room service on both days. I requested delivery at 7am the first day- got it at 8.50, ordered for 7.00 second day, got it at 7.20. Breakfast fairly cold both days and nothing special. I would put this hotel into the three star category myself, and would not recommend it to a friend looking for a hotel with four star service.
",3,2007,02,26
218,nice and old looking hotel,"I slept in the hotel for 3 days and it was ok. I wouldnt think that the restaurant is so good, as it was described,but the Pub is hilarious!

I attended a wedding on the 2 day, and this was fantastic! Staff, food, decoration-everything was brilliant!

",4,2007,02,22
218,Amazing Hotel - Loved it!,"My fiancée and I stayed here for a 2 night break, and we had an absolutely amazing time. It was late in the evening when we arrived and from the moment I seen the hotel lit up, as we drove up the beautiful driveway I knew this hotel was magical and special. Checking in was very efficient and the staff were extremely helpful. We stayed in the newer part of the hotel and our room was tastefully decorated, bright and spacious. It had a very traditional old world feel which we prefer over the ultra modern hotels. But I think the rooms would appeal to all customers tastes. We ate in Turners restaurant the first night and the steak was one of the finest we ever had. The service was far above average. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the wines on offer and very friendly. We retired to the Nuns kitchen for drinks and the atmosphere here was informal but lovely, perfect for a few quite drinks. 

Saturday morning we made our way to Turners for breakfast and I can only say that the breakfast buffet was one of the finest breakfasts I have ever had. We had a stroll around the beautiful grounds after breakfast but as it was so cold we didn’t stay outside for very long. 

The rest of Saturday was spent relaxing in the beautiful spa. First class facilities but a pity the spa is in a separate building.

As dinner was so good Friday evening we ate in Turners again on Saturday night. First class food and wine again.

There was a wedding in the hotel on Saturday and I couldn't help wish that we too had booked Killashee for our upcoming nuptials. There is a beautiful piano bar upstairs and it would be a wonderful location to entertain guests. It seems like a perfect location for a wedding. Amazing food and service and the grounds offer beautiful photo opportunities.

I couldn't recommend Killashee highly enough and look forward to the girly weekend I have booked with some female friends in April.
",5,2007,02,13
218,Fabulous Hotel,"Fabulous hotel, service was brilliant. Stayed here for a wedding. Has to be one of the most romantic venues I have attended a wedding.

The food was the best I have ever had at a wedding. Would strongly recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend break.
",5,2007,02,02
218,Simply First Class,"This is the third time Ive stayed in this hotel and I am never ever disapointed.  The rooms are always excellent, clean tidy and loads of space - beds turned down at night and chocolate on the pillow.

Staff are excellent and the food and service are again first class

Only complaint is no tea/coffee in the room  but there is room serviced if needed.

All in all highly recommended

",5,2007,02,02
218,Nice but not perfect,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of November to attend a wedding. We were not impressed as we arrived as they had blocked off the approach to reception because they  had a car launch that day, so reserved the front of the hotel for those cars. We were  directed  to one of the car parks, unable to drop off our bags at reception - guests were having to struggle back on their own with their luggage, and wheeled bags were no help as the drive in front of the hotel is gravel.
The next problem, as mentioned in a previous review, is the difficulty of actually getting to your room. We had a ground floor room, but to get there we had to go up to the 2nd floor in one lift, walk across a large lounge area, and down again in another lift. Whoever designed the extensions for the bedrooms? Why didn't they plan a way through on the ground floor?
The room itself was absolutely fine, but I'm afraid I have a couple of niggles there too. First - why do they have to put waterproof  mattress protectors on the bed? Surely I am not the only one who wakes up in a sweat by sleeping on plastic. I would have thought these covers were more suitable for a doss-house than a 4-star hotel. The second thing was the tea/coffee arrangement. There were no facilities to make your own in the room, but tea and coffee was free on room service. In the afternoon this took some time to arrive. First thing in the morning it was very quick, but there was no robe in the room, so you had to get up and get dressed before it arrived. The second day we were there I did eventually get a towelling robe in the room, after asking twice.

We ate the first evening in the Nuns Kitchen. Food was OK, nothing special, but the wine list was very limited, not 4star standard at all. I can't comment on Turners restaurant as we didn't eat there.

The swimming pool, gym and spa are in a separate building, not accessible by an indoor route. The swimming pool seems to be frquently used for classes, so there are just a couple of lanes left for you to go for a swim (and swimming hats must be worn).

Lastly, do check your bill if you are from the UK. Instead of giving us a credit card bill in euro, they had converted in to pounds, with a 3% surcharge, and presented it to us to sign - it says that you have been asked and agreed to having your bill in pounds! We did not sign it and asked them to put the bill through in euro.

I seem to have made a lot of negative comments here, but we did enjoy our stay, and had a great time at the wedding.

218,Hit and Miss - definately not 4 star,"My husband spent 2 nights last weekend at Killashee in a junior suite for a romantic weekend before the birth of our second child. The suite was roomy and well decorated but smoky.  I was disappointed with the vegetarian choices in Turner Restauant, the starters were both soup with no choice of main course & a poor choice of sweets although the food was lovely overall, well presented and tasty. Staff very attentive. Breakfast the first morning was fine, buffet isn't very exciting - on the second morning it was disastrous, badly organised with people waiting for tables, no butter, milk on the table, I had to wait at least 3/4hr for toast after asking for it three times by this stage my coffee was cold. The pancakes were not available as the chef had not pre-made enough!! there were no yoghurts available - in my opinion poor planning all round....
",3,2006,10,31
218,Not quite four star,"I stayed here for a girly weekend at the beginning of June.  The hotel itself is very convenient to Naas, being only a short drive from the town centre.  It is set in huge, beautiful grounds.

While some aspects of the hotel were great, it fell down in other areas.  In order to get to our room, we had to take two lifts, followed by several corridors and doors.  It was like a maze and we almost needed a map to find out way back to reception.  When we did get to our room, it was very stuffy and smoky, with no air conditioning (normally not a problem in the Irish climate, but this was a humid weekend and as the window kept blowing shut when we opened it it was impossible to get any air).  Also, the hotel appears to cater to numerous wedding parties, with the corridors full of drunk rowdy patrons all through the night.

The spa is actually located in a separate building, which is accessed through a car park from the back of the hotel.  After a relaxing treatment in the spa, it is not really nice to have to get back to the hotel this way through the back door.  However, I do understand that there is some form of shuttle from the main reception.

The meal in Turners Restaurant was very nice but as they only offer a set three course menu (at fifty euro a head), there is not much to choose from.  The wine is also above the average mark up.  The Nuns Bar also provides food, but as it was crammed full of kids it tended to get very noisy.

Overall, I felt that this hotel was above average but not consistent with other four star spa hotels that I have stayed in.  If you get a good deal, it may be worth it.

218,Brilliant Hotel,"My wife and I got married in Killashee House in 2004 and returned for our anniversary in 2005. 
It really is an amazing place - grounds, food, building spa all world class. The attention to detail was incredible - daily and evening papers left in your room along with a little hand written weather forecast cards. For our anniversary stay we got a complimentary bottle of champagne and fresh fruit salad.  The spa was excellent - Molton Brown products used.

One tip - the food in the main restaurant is much better than in the Nun's Pantry - worth paying the extra.

218,I have fallen in love with this hotel,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying in Killahsee for the Punchestown race week and I have to say the hotel was excellent. Everything from the free paper outside our bedroom door to breakfast to dinner in the restaurant each evening. It was so convenient to pop over to the spa for a massage and a quick blow dry before we headed off to the races it felt like heaven.  As it was extrealy busy for the races all of the staff were so helful and friendly at all times. I am so lucking forward to returning to Killishee again soon. As I work in a busy hotel reception myself it is great to get away and enjoy the comforts of another hotel. I could not fault one thing... Well done to all at Killashee....

218,Fantastic place to stay,"A friend of mine and I stayed there on a 2 night break, and it was absolutely fantastic. From the moment we booked in, to when we checked out, the staff could not do enough for us. One the first night we had dinner in the Nun Kitchen bar, even though the atmosphere was very informal, the staff were very efficient, and the food was excellent, great value for money. The second night, we had dinner in the Turners restaurant, again the food was excellent, the staff extremely helpful & efficient. The Spa was fantastic... very relaxing. Would recommend it for a girls weekend away, a romantic break for a couple. I could not fault the weekend in any way
",5,2006,04,03
218,A paradox,"There is something paradoxical about this hotel: It is set in lovely grounds, with great views of the Wicklow hills, and the rooms really are excellent, but it is slightly gloomy and the ambiance is charmless. If you are looking for a romantic weekend or a wedding venue, I'd be inclined to go elsewhere. The staff are like the curate's egg: the Irish and East European staff are wonderful, but the bar staff were frightful: probably because the consumption of alcohol is verboten under their belief system. On balance, I'd give it a miss.

218,Loved this hotel!,"Stayed here for one night when I was attending a wedding.  The wedding food was the best I have ever tasted!

218,Not Four Star on Service,"My Husband and I took a two night Couples Retreat.
The Spa was excellent but the hotel was extreamely disapointing.  Staff are unpleasent and rude.  Make sure you have plenty of time when placing an order for food in the Bar or Gallery cause you'll be waiting the rest of the day.

The manicured gardens and wonderful views are ruined by dumps around the complex.

Good luck if there is a wedding on.  There were two on each of the three days we were there.  You could hear the DJ from our room.

The final straw came when a staff member let a door close in my Husbands face whilst he was carrying our luggage.

Not a relaxing retreat.

218,Beautiful Country Retreat.,"We had the pleasure of staying here for a night back in July 2005.  The hotel was a magnificent old manor type building set in the country up a long sweeping driveway. Very secluded and ideal for a romantic break away. The rooms had 2 very comfy double beds and the bathrooms had all Molton Brown shampoo/lotion, etc.  

Well worth a visit and would definitely recommend!

218,Hotel precioso,"Edificio precioso con mucha historia. En zona muy tranquila y con espacios en el hotel para disfrutar de la gastronomia irlandesa y su hospitalidad.

Esta recien reformado y ha quedado precioso! El Centro comercial outlet que esta muy cerca es muy recomendable.",5,2022,11,10
218,Verblassende Grösse,"Von außen wirkt das Hotel noch herrschaftlich, wie aus Zeiten des Empires. Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und altertümlich eingerichtet, das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis stimmt.  Dann sind aber die guten Seiten schon aufgezählt. Die Speisekarte im Restaurant/Bistro ist sehr übersichtlich,  das Essen aber in Ordnung. Was auffällt ist,  dass eine Menge Personal vorhanden ist,  jedoch etwas planlos in der Gegend herumsteht. Mann hat den Eindruck,  dass man den Anforderungen an ein 4-Sterne Hotel mit viel wenig qualifiziertem Personal genüge tun möchte. Beim auschecken dannen die obligatorische Frage ob alles ok war. Auf meine Bemerkung,  dass es bis auf den nächtlichen Lärm durch die Hochzeitsgesellschaft gut war,  die Musik wurde irgendwann extrem laut,  so dass die auch in allen Schlafzimmern zu hören war,  wurde dann zur Sicherheit lieber überhaupt nicht eingegangen. Bei einem Vier Sterne Hotel erwartete ich hier besser geschultes Personal,  welches nicht nur alles nach Schema F abspult. ",4,2019,07,26
218,"Außen hui, innen weniger","Schönes Haus mit toller Gartenanlage und großen Zimmern aber mäßig gut gepflegt. Ohne Vorankündigung waren Restaurant und Bar geschlossen, geöffnet hatte das Bistro, das einer Bahnhofshalle gleicht und weit entfernt von sauber war. Personal eher unpersönlich, vor allem an der Rezeption. Das Abendessen überraschend gut, das Frühstück ausgesprochen schlecht.",3,2019,07,22
218,un hotel muy bonito,"El hotel es majestuoso, grande y muy bien decorado,
las habitaciones muy amplias y cómodas,
el servicio muy amable,
el restaurante tiene buen servicio y buena calidad en su comida,
el bufete de desayuno algo escaso para los gustos europeos, pues falta un poco de embutido, o salmón .
tiene spa y las piscinas están muy bien equipadas.
pero por lo demás maravilloso, ",5,2018,10,15
218,Un hotel suggestivo ,"Qui per una riunione famigliare del mio compagno, sono rimasta molto colpita dal bellissimo palazzo storico di questa struttura sia esternamente con i suoi parchi curatissimi che internamente con saloni con soffitti alti e decorati, scale antiche insomma davvero un posto di altri tempi. La camera pulita e il letto molto comodo. Il pranzo era pure molto buono e fresco. Da consigliare sicuramente. L’unica nota negativa era un atteggiamento un po’ arrogante in generale da parte dello staff- difficilmente un sorriso e peccato devo dire perché quella sensazione di essere un po’ una principessa in una favola è stato smorzato da questo. Bravo il ragazzo giovane che ci ha servito a tavola: sorridente, appassionato del suo lavoro pronto a spiegarci i piatti. Bravo.",3,2018,08,30
218,Romantisches Hotel,"Das Hotel ist von einem romantischen Garten umgeben. Schon bei der Einfahrt hat man das Gefühl in einen Schlosspark zu fahren. Das Hauptgebäude sieht fast kitschig schön aus. Die Rezeption sieht aus wie eine Eingangshalle eines grossen Herrenhauses mit einer Wendeltreppe zum ersten Stock. Der Garten bietet 1000 Möglichkeiten für romantische Fotoaufnahmen. Der Zimmertrakt ist verwinkelt und erinnert ein wenig an das Hotel in Shining, aber selbstverständlich nicht gruselig. Die Zimmer sind angenehm gross. Wir (2 Erwachsene, 2 Kinder) hatten genügend Platz. Das Frühstücksbuffet war gut und das Personal war sehr freundlich. Der Fitnessbereich ist gigantisch, hab ihn aber nicht besucht. Das Hallenbad ist gross, das Wasser ist - wie in den anderen Hotels die ich besucht habe auch - sehr chlorhaltig. Das Dampfbad, dass ich besucht habe, war i.O. Was saunieren angeht, könnten die Iren noch etwas dazulernen. Wir haben das Hotel gebucht, weil es auf unserem Weg lag, nicht weil wir es ausgesucht haben. Aber, wenn ich einen Patz für meine Hochzeit oder meine Flitterwochen suchen würde, dann wäre dies meine Wahl.",5,2018,08,01
218,Wow che colazione,"Arrivati nel.cuore della notte, siamo stati ospitati in due family room confortevoli ampie e con vista sul fantastico parco che attornia questo edificio storico e le dependance. Colazione fantastica, irish breakfast e colazione internazionale. Purtroppo si è trattato solo di un soggiorno stop and go. Gentilissimo il personale. Da consigliare",5,2018,06,08
218,"Vieles passt, insgesamt zu viele Fehler für ein 4* Haus","Sehr schöne Zufahrt, tolle Parkanlage, ein prächtiges Zentralgebäude. Beim Betreten erschlägt einen die dunkle Farbgestaltung - nicht jedermann's Geschmack.Schon beim Empfang wirkte die Dame eher genervt, ratterte ihre Sprüche runter und war nur auf mehrmaliges Nachfragen zu verständlichen Antworten zu bewegen. Erster Minuspunkt: Restaurant nur FR und SA geöffnet. Die Zimmer befinden sich an Fluren, die wie eine Anstalt wirken (was es ja auch zeitweise war - nämlich Waisenheim und Frauengefängnis). Die Zimmer groß, die Möbel klassich, aber vielfach abgestoßen. Die Betten ok. Das Bad - wir hatten eines mit behindertengerechter Ausstattung - funktional, aber in einem solchen Hotel stört der Plastikvorhang dann doch. Die Aussicht auf einen Hinterhof und Betontrakt - zum Vergessen. Wir warteten dann auf Freunde an der Bar, während der ganzen Zeit durchzog ein Geruch von Fisch den Raum, nicht sehr angenehm. Als wir gegen 22:30 zurückkamen, wirkte die Bar geschlossen, wir verzichteten daher auf einen kleinen Abendtrunk. Das Frühstück ausreichend, gute Auswahl typisch irischer Frühstückszutaten, die Brötchen hart, Käse und Wurst - na ja, das Omlett und das Rührei mit Lachs sehr gut. Der Service nicht immer aufmerksam, sowohl dem Kaffee mussten wir hinterherlaufen ebenso der Bestellung der Eierspeisen.",3,2017,06,16
218,Magnífica estancia en un hotel con encanto,"Es lo que esperarías de un hotel en la campiña irlandesa. Un palacete rodeado de verdes jardines. Un entorno precioso y un interior a la altura. Acogedor, pero a lo grande. Amplios salones, y en nuestro caso una habitación espectacular, con recibidor, salón y una cama enorme. Estupendo desayuno irlandés en el antiguo comedor del internado, que también es especial. Personal amable. Para pasar uno o varios días tranquilos y bien atendidos.",5,2017,02,18
218,Struttura suggestiva,"Breve soggiorno, per motivi di lavoro. Si tratta di una struttura in stile, suggestiva ed immersa nel verde. Non ho avuto la possibilità di visitare la spa con palestra e piscina; la camera è confortevole, pulita e molto spaziosa.-",4,2017,01,17
218,DELUDENTE,"Di ritorno da un trekking nel Sud del paese io e mia moglie abbiamo deciso di chiudere iin bellezza offrendoci l'ultima notte irlandese in un hotel di charme con SPA.
Esternamente l'hotel è suggestivo ma già dal numero consistente di auto parcheggiate avremmo dovuto subodorare qualcosa. Dell'hotel de Charme ha ben poco, trattandosi di un'immenso ""matrimonificio"" apparentemente piuttosto apprezzato dai locali. Check in rapido in mezzo ad una hall riempita di folle vocianti vestite a festa. Dopo aver atteso circa 20 minuti un ascensore che non arrivava (probabilmente monopolizzato dalle centinaia di invitati a nozze) e senza aver ricevuto alcun aiuto dal personale, ci è stata indicata una scala per salire al piano superiore. Abbigliati da trekking e dopo 6 ore di viaggio, ci siamo trovati nel bel mezzo di un salone dove si stava svolgendo un rinfresco, e, tra gli sguardi stupiti e divertiti dei partecipanti, con altri malcapitati come noi lo abbiamo attraversato per raggiungere la nostra stanza. Corridoi lunghissimi e poco illumintai con moquette odorante di cane bagnato. Stanza ad onor del vero ampia, pulita e ben arredata, nel classico stile ""british"" con suggestiva vista sui meravigliosi giardini.  Ma il bagno è di nuovo una delusione; piastrelle incrinate,  fughe ammuffite nella doccia e lavandino piuttosto vissuto. Segnale wi-fi inesistente. 
Abbagliati dalla denominazione dell'Hotel (e dalle immagini del sito internet) ci aspettavamo di poter usufruire di una bella e riposante SPA. Errore... quella pubblicizzata è un'area relax che si paga a parte . La SPA prevista dall nostra juinior suite da 270 euro altro non è che una dependance dell'Hotel (alla quale tra l'altro si accede uscendo dallo stesso e camminando per 200 metri sotto la pioggia)  trasformata in palestra, con piscina anni 70 e sauna vintage, aperta al pubblico locale e frequentata da una colorita clientela di culturisti tatuati. 
Precipitoso rientro in camera.  
Cena nel loro country bar - suggestivo ed elegante - ma che alle 9 di sera non serve più pasti (sic). La gentilissima addetta di sala prende ancora la nostra ordinazione se ci accontentiamo di un'insalata. Buona per la verità, cosi come il dessert. Ma il personale di sala è mal organizzato e non molto attento.  Per attirarne l'attenzione bisogna sbracciarsi come segnalatori aeroportuali. 
Colazione il mattino dopo nel vasto salone del ristorante, anche qui bello e ben decorato; il buffet è generoso e di ottima qualità. Da non perdere gli scones e il meraviglioso pane grigio. Ma la musica da radio locale troppo alta e filodiffusa rovina la bella atmosfera un po' vittoriana del luogo. 
In conclusione esperienza piuttosoto deludente, sia per il prezzo (ampiamente al di sopra del servizio offerto)  sia per l'approssimazione. Sito internet poco chiaro (per non dire vagamente ingannevole).  Ma c'é del potenziale, basterebbe sfruttarlo.",2,2016,08,02
218,"Will mehr sein, als es ist","Nach 2 1/2 Wochen Rundreise durch Irland, war das Hotel Killashee House unsere letzte Übernachtung und wir hatten dieses Haus bewusst als Abschluss gewählt und wollten uns dies gönnen.

Der erste Eindruck ist sehr stimmig, man fährt die Anlage durch eine schöne Privatstrasse durch einen Garten / Park an. Auch das erste sichtbare Gebäude ist wunderschön und der Eingang zur Rezeption wie auch diese selber beeindrucken.
Am Empfang dann der erste Dämpfer. Wir müssen voraus schicken, dass wir fast 6 Monate zuvor über HRS zu einem beeindruckend günstigen Preis zwei Zimmer gebucht hatten. Dies liess man uns an der Rezeption ab der Begrüssung merken. Sehr distanziert wollte die Dame zuerst die Reservation nicht finden, dann ausgedruckt vorgelegt durch uns, telefonierte sie einer Kollegien, erklärte dieser was sie da an Reservation habe und das diese in deutscher Sprache sei, was sehr abschätzig tönte. Ziemlich gelangweilt checkte sie uns dann ein. Als wir ein Zimmer hatten, fragte sie uns ob noch etwas sei und wir bestätigten, das wir ja zwei Zimmer reserviert haben, zu Viert am Empfang stünden und wohl das zweite Zimmer auch einchecken möchten. Nun, mit dem Kapitel ""Rezeption"" war ein grosser Teil unserer Vorfreude getrübt worden.

Der Weg zu den zwei Zimmern war etwas umständlich, was uns aber nicht störte. Zum Teil ergeben sich aber lange Wege, da ein beachtlicher Teil der Zimmer sich in zwei funktionellen, etwas kasernenartigen Zimmerflügeln befinden. Unsere zwei  Zimmer zwei waren grosszügig, sauber, gut ausgestattet, geschmackvoll (old style) eingerichtet. Die Badezimmer sind schön, aber schlecht beleuchtet und so ein wenig dunkel.

Der Spa mit Fitnessbereich und Bad befindet sich wiederum in einem separaten Gebäude und wirkt für ein Hotel eher uninspiriert. Diese Bereiche sind öffentlich zugänglich und wir hatten das Gefühl, dass es kaum Hotelgäste waren, man sich also eher in einen privaten Fitness- und Badebereich begibt.

Da das Turners Restaurant nur freitags und samstags geöffnet hat, hatten wir vorgängig per Mail in der Bar reserviert, was auch bestätigt wurde, nur wusste an diesem Abend Niemand mehr etwas davon (passt Zum Erlebnis mit der Rezeption).

Das Frühstück ist irisch, d.h. ausser den wirklich leckeren frisch zubereiteten warmen Gerichten für kontinentale Vorstellungen eher ein bisschen mager - zumindest für ein solches Hotel - dazu eher uninspiriert angerichtet. 

Insgesamt - gerade auch von aussen - wirken viele Ecken etwas vernachlässigt.",3,2016,07,29
218,Erster Eindruck - großartig. Zweiter Eindruck - mit kleinen Einschränkungen,"Wir haben das Killashee House Hotel am Ende einer 17-tägigen Irland-Rundreise - sozusagen als krönenden Abschluss anlässlich eines runden Geburtstages - gebucht. Der erste Eindruck ist großartig, die Anfahrt durch großzügige Grünanlagen beeindruckend. Der Empfang im historischen Teil des Hauses nett, freundlich, professionell. Der Weg zu den Zimmern etwas umständlich, zum Teil lange Wege. Die meisten Zimmer befinden sich in zwei funktionellen Zimmerflügeln. Unser Zimmer war großzügig, sauber, gut ausgestattet, geschmackvoll (old style) eingerichtet, das Badezimmer sehr schön, das Zimmer bei Tageslicht ein wenig dunkel. Insgesamt waren wir bisher sehr zufrieden. 

Allerdings hapert es bei den Kleinigkeiten: Der Fitnessbereich wirkt ein wenig abgeschabt, es sind nicht die neuesten Geräte. Das Bad wirkt für ein Hotel eher uninspiriert, eher wie ein 70er-Jahr-Bad. Außerdem war gerade Kinderschwimmen, entsprechend laut ging es zu. Für die Sauna gibt es keinen Ruhebereich, die kalte Dusche ist nicht so dolle. 

Abends hätten wir uns sehr ein gutes Essen im Turners Restaurant gewünscht, das hat aber nur freitags und samstags auf….. Also doch in die Bar, dort viel Licht, aber auch Schatten. Die meisten, aber eben nicht alle Servicekräfte wirken gut ausgebildet, so wurde z.B. eine bestellte Flasche Wein nicht gebracht, weil der Kellner uns nicht richtig verstanden hat, aber statt nachzufragen gar nichts gemacht hat. Erst auf Nachfrage kam der Wein, da war das Essen aber schon fast kalt. Das Holzbrett auf dem die Vorspeise serviert worden war, gehörte wohl noch der Belling-Familie :-), wirkte nicht sehr hygienisch. Das Essen selber (Sirloin-Steak mit Beilagen) war super lecker, sehr schön zubereitet und angerichtet. 

Die Bar ist ganz nett, aber es gibt nur wenige (nämlich 9) Cocktails, nur wenige Klassiker, keinen Pina Colada :-( Ab 22.30 waren dann bis auf den Bartender alle Servicekräfte schlagartig verschwunden, so dass dann auch die Gäste überwiegend auf Selbstbedienung umsteigen mussten. 

Das Frühstück ist irisch, d.h. außer den wirklich leckeren frisch zubereiteten warmen  Gerichten für kontinentale Vorstellungen eher ein bisschen mager - zumindest für ein 4-Sterne-Hotel - dazu eher uninspiriert angerichtet. Die angepriesene reichhaltige Auswahl an Wurst und Käse bestand - obwohl wenig los war - aus 4 Scheiben Chorizo, 5 Scheiben Cheddar und einem Schinkenröllchen. Sehr zu empfehlen das Omelette mit Frühlingszwiebeln, Käse und Schinken!

Insgesamt - gerade auch von außen - wirken viele Ecken etwas vernachlässigt. Gerade weil es ein 4-Sterne-Haus ist, fällt die Kritik auch bei solchen Dingen natürlich differenzierter aus. Insgesamt hat das Haus aber ein besonderes Flair, von daher würde ich sicher noch einmal wiederkommen, dann aber am Wochenende.",4,2014,05,21
218,Maniero nella campagna irlandese,"Frequento questo hotel prevalentemente per ragioni di lavoro, incluse riunioni e conferenze.
L'aspetto esteriore è grandioso : già dal lungo viale d'entrata si scorge questa costruzione in pietra molto bella e scenografica, articolata in varie parti e fornita di un bellissimo parco.
Alla reception, servizio gentile e efficiente.
Le camere sono spaziose, molto ""irish"", con moquette, bagno ben curato e amenities di qualità.
Da migliorare la televisione sia per il modello piuttosto antiquato sia per la selezione dei canali che è limitata a quelli irlandesi e alcuni inglesi (gli ospiti credo siano in prevalenza continentali).
Nel complesso c'è aria di organizzazione, pulizia e sollecitudine.
Per quanto concerne la colazione, ci sono dei punti di miglioramento : in momenti di affluenza il servizio è talvolta lento e un po' confuso (c'è il buffet freddo e il servizio di warm breakfast alla carta). 
Se uno decide di ordinare dalla carta il tutto può diventare un po' troppo lungo. Il buffet può essere migliorato come qualità e quantità : ad esempio oggi non c'era il pane.
Suggerirei anche un po' più di scelta nei salumi e nei formaggi. In compenso ci sono cereali di ogni sorta.
Se avete tempo passeggiate nel curatissimo e rilassante parco, soprattutto la zona detta Butterfly Garden con bellissime piante.",4,2014,05,21

218,Muy buen hotel,"Realmente muy buen hotel en la campiña irlandesa. Un ex internado de señoritas hoy transformado en hotel con comodísimas habitaciones, con una camas que lo dejan a uno con las ganas de llevárselas. El problema fue que no habían prendido la calefacción en la habitación y hasta que no calentó el ambiente  estaba frío. Como anecdótico fue llegar a la habitación pero peor fue regresar al lobby. Resulta que hay tomar una ascensor para el primer piso; después caminar por una largo corredor, munido de varias curvas, para tomar otro ascensor. En este ascensor hay que apretar el mismo piso, aunque no cambiamos de nivel, que apretamos en primer ascensor, o sea el 1, pero cuando uno quiere regresar para ir al lobby hay que apretar el 3. Inentendible. Pude salir porque después de varios intentos infructuosos apareció un huésped que me ayudó a salir. Hubo otros pasajeros que llamaron a recepción para que los vengan a buscar. Claro uno cuando se registra y lo acompaña el botones no presta atención a todo ese disparate. Por lo demás muy buen hotel, muy buenos ambientes en la recepción. Muy buen desayuno y buen restorán.",4,2014,03,27
218,Muy buena estancia en familia,"Estuve con mi familia aquí. La verdad, la habitación triple era enorme, así que por el precio estaba muy bien. El único inconveniente es que la cama era muy incómoda, sobre todo la plegable, la tele era antigua (con lo lujoso que es el hotel), en el baño hacía mucho frío (no había calentador) y en general en toda la habitación (y eso que era septiembre). La comida y el servicio excelentes. Pero otro inconveniente del hotel es que muchas bodas se celebran aquí y los huéspedes están de fiesta hasta altas horas de la madrugada por los pasillos. También, está lejos del pueblo y si vienes a Irlanda sin coche, tienes que estar dependiendo de los taxis (que aquí son muy caros)",4,2014,02,20
218,Immer wieder gerne!,"War über Ostern 2013 bereits zum dritten Mal dort und jedes Mal war ich begeistert.
(Komme meist nach Mitternacht an - was aber kein Problem ist - und reise am Folgetag in den Süden..)
Die Zimmer sind grosszügig gestaltet und lassen - mit Ausnahme einer fehlenden Minibar - keine Wünsche offen. (Das Fehlen der Minibar wird durch die Bar kompensiert, die meist auch noch zu nachtschlafender Stunde offen ist.)
Begeistert bin ich auf von den SPA-Möglichkeiten und natürlich der wunderschönen Umgebung (Park).",5,2013,04,17
218,Ottimo per grandi eventi,"Ci siamo stati per un matrimonio e devo ammettere che l'organizzazione è stata perfetta, tutto si svolge all'interno dell'hotel risultando molto comodo per quelli che come noi vengono da fuori.
La struttura, un ex convento di suore, a 30 minuti da Dublino è molto grande e direi ben gestita, bello il parco ma peccato per una zona operativa attaccata alla struttura che pare un cantiere.
La camera era molto grande con due letti king size a disposizione, pulita ma mediamente insonorizzata
Niente male la palestra e spa (di cui però non abbiamo approfittato) in una struttura separata aperta a tutti.
Il personale è stato veramente gentile e disponibile anche per risolvere piccoli problemi, complimenti davvero.
Il bar e lo Snug pub li consiglio tranquillamente.",4,2013,04,03
218,Sehr schönes Ambiente!,Wir waren im August 2012 eine Nacht im Killashee House Hotel. Das Zimmer war groß und geräumig und der Service nett und freundlichen. Das Frühstück ließ keine Wünsche offen. Zum Flughafen Dublin haben wir ca. 45 min. benötigt.,5,2012,09,02
218,wir waren überwältigt!,"Ein altes Kloster, etwas außerhalb der kleinen Ortschaft Nass in einem riesengroßen Park liegt dieses einzigartige, individuell gestaltete Luxushotel. Man entdeckt in jedem Detail, dass man sich große Mühe gibt, alle Kundenwünsche zu übertreffen. Die Zimmer sind renoviert und im ""old Irish Style"" eingerichtet. (wir hatten ein Himmelbett), trotzdem sehr modern und sauber. Das Personal ist überall sehr kundenorientiert, die Bar das Restaurant hat eine kleine aber feine Karte, der Service ist schnell und vorbildlich. Hier lässt sich der ""High Tea"" wirklich vom allerfeinsten zelebrieren.
Einziger Nachteil sind für gehbehinderte Leute die z.T. weiten Wege zu/von den Zimmern.
Der Flughafen Dublin ist bei wenig Verkehr in gut 30 Minute erreichbar. Sicher eine sehr gute Wahl für einen Kurzurlaub oder eine Konferenz!",5,2012,06,27
218,Hochzeitshotel mit sprödem Charme,Das Hotel liegt in einem kleinem Park de sehr gepflegt ist. Der Glanz früherer Tage hält eine gefangen. Im Jahr finden ca. 180 Hochzeitsfeiern hier statt. Wer von livrierten Angestellten das Frühstück gereicht bekommen möchte ist hier richtig. Das Frühstück selbst reicht aus. Auf Grund der Größe ist die Anonymität groß. Dublin ist in 45 Minuten erreichbar.,3,2011,07,24
