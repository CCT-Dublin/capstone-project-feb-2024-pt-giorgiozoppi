215,Great choice,"Very happy at the Alex. Took advantage of early check-in option since our flight from the states arrived early in the morning.

215,Make sure you check your room door is closed,"We had a 4 night stay at The Alex, great location, walking distance to everything Dublin has to offer. The hotel is at the end of an almost dead-end street so parking outside the hotel was not an issue if the designated hotel drop off spots were already taken.  We used the close by carpark which at 18E's per day we thought was reasonable value. You pay on arrival  at the carpark (ours a 4 day stay, so 72E's) exit and re-entry is then easy with your ticket. The room is stylish but there's always design issues with any hotel room and this one is no exception. There are no towel rails in the bathroom to hang & dry towels, so we had to request fresh ones each day.  Gym at the neighbouring hotel was excellent. Reception staff did their job but offered no more, no friendly greeting, we were never acknowledged on arrival or departure each day, they were always looking at the computer screen. The main issue is that the room doors doesn't automatically shut which is an obvious personal safety and security issue. Each day on walking down the corridor I made a point of pushing on each door and sure enough some were open, I surprised a few guests!! Bed was comfortable and the rooms were well insulated, very quiet.",4,2024,09,16

215,Best Hotel Experience in over 30 years.,"Every aspect of our stay was superb, from the decor to cleanliness - but especially the responsiveness and friendliness of the staff.

215,Highly Recommend,"Our stay at the Alex was incredible. The check in process was amazing. We arrived very early in the morning from our international flight and the staff did everything they could to get us a room early. The extra sleep after the flight was so necessary to help us not be jet lagged. We came to Ireland for our wedding so we extra appreciated being able to get on the new time zone with this extra sleep. Thank you so so much to Caio for making this possible- it put our whole trip out on the right foot. He was so wonderful to work with as a guest. The room was beautiful and clean and luxurious. The bed was so comfy too. There was A/C also which meant we could be comfortable without opening the windows and hearing the outside street sounds.Alvaro was super helpful in restaurant suggestions for us. The breakfast was super super good. I really enjoyed the coffee, fruit and sausages specifically. We had a wonderful time overall! For the price, you get way more than you do at other hotels for similar cost.",5,2024,09,14

The  Ginger Man and Kennedy's are two great pubs within walking distance; we ate at both, and the food was very good and traditional Irish.

I'm a light sleeper and was not woken up once from the sounds of other people or the street below. The breakfast was delicious too. If I am ever in Dublin again, I would 100% choose to stay here. ",5,2024,08,26
215,Exceptional reception!,"Was there for a work event. Relied heavily on assistance from reception (Anais and Simon) with some business needs and guests. They were extremely professional and accommodated every need. 
Anais was very patience with some of our guests that needed some extra attention. She went above and beyond in making sure they were happy. 
Excellent customer service all round from the staff.",5,2024,08,25
215,Looking forward to our next visit!,"We stayed at this hotel 8 years ago and had a wonderful experience, so we decided to return this summer with high expectations. We are happy to say that this visit was even better than we remembered! A big thank you to Sim√≥n, √Ålvaro, and the entire Alex team for going above and beyond to make our stay truly memorable.

215,Alex Hotel is magnificent,The pillows were the fluffiest ever and the mattress perfect! We loved the shower and want to build a shower like this one. I loved the makeup mirror and the bathroom decoration too. The front desk especially Murilo was so helpful. Love Alex! Front desk was always helpful and went out of their way to help us. Find places to work out.,5,2024,08,19
215,Fabulous service,Fabulous service! Andreea was so fabulous and kind. The venue was also gorgeous and the wine and dessert was tasty. Will definitely be back and I recommend anybody else to come here. The dining area was lovely and it‚Äôs a hidden gem in Dublin. 10/10!!!,5,2024,08,19
215,Wonderful Find,We recently stayed here for three nights and enjoyed our stay very much.   The hotel is very well located to everything in Dublin and the staff is pleasant and helpful.   Rooms are spacious and comfortable.   Special thanks to Abdul in the breakfast room and a big thank you to Murillo who made some great suggestions re dinners and ensured that we had reservations to these lovely restaurants.   We will definitely stay here again.,5,2024,08,19
215,Excellent Hotel located in heart of Dublin!,Came for a week long business trip and was blown away by the accommodations at The Alex. The staff was so friendly and helpful towards visiting travelers. Notable highlights were the daily breakfast provided and the fully loaded gym located a short walk away at their sister hotel. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel for any business/ vacation related visits to Dublin!,5,2024,08,19
215,Great experience,"The Alex was a cute and well-located hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The gym absolutely blew me away and was the highlight of an already great trip. It was clean and had a wide variety of new equipment, including three squat and bench racks! So nice to be able to do my normal workout on a work trip. ",5,2024,08,19
215,"Posh, comfortable, walkable, magic","The Alex is a posh and comfortable hotel in a great location to easily explore the city on foot. The hotel is recently renovated and a fun mix of modern and classic aesthetics. 

Simon took care of us all week - and even wowed us with a special magic trick to end our night! 

I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2024,08,18
215,Thank you Sim√≥n :),We were helped by lovely staff member Sim√≥n who was very helpful and answered many questions. They also made sure to take care of you by giving you water when you first come in and they have little candies you can take.The rooms are beautiful and it‚Äôs in a great location to explore the town and no car is needed. I would definitely come again,5,2024,08,18
215,Solid Dublin hotel with nice staff. Would stay again,"I recently completed an enjoyable 5 night stay as part of a large corporate event. The front desk staff were always exceedingly polite and helpful. I casually mentioned to Murilo that I was checking out extremely early for my return flight and he provided guidance on when I should actually leave, plus voluntarily offered to have a takeout breakfast be available for me. That was a nice gesture!

Breakfast was included in our rate. Unfortunately it was the exact same buffet each day, but there was at least enough variety to not get too bored. Multiple hot options including eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, pudding, some veggies and a lot of cold options incl yogurt, cereal and toast stations, meats and cheeses, etc. Coffee was pretty decent and even though it was self-service, the staff was attentive.

The room - very comfortable bed with nice linens, tons of outlets, a functional desk, a safe, huge closet, etc. Big bathroom as well.

Biggest room issue was the AC. It simply didn't cool and I'd wake repeatedly each night sweating bullets. A colleague had the same issue and the front desk gave her a fan, but I didn't bother. Also, the Nespresso machine didn't work. I left a note for housekeeping but nothing was done and it wasn't a big deal since I was having coffee with breakfast anyway. One weird quirk about my shower - the shower head was installed so close to the wall that you were basically pressed up against the hand wand framing, which was pretty unfortunate.

The Alex doesn't have a gym, but you're allowed access to a pretty good one a few steps away at The Mont",5,2024,08,17
215,Lovely lovely lovely!,"The Alex is a boutique hotel that is very comfortable. I stayed here for a week and loved it, from the details of acknowledging my love for chocolate caramels and refilling the candy jar as well as an excellent wake up call system that did almost too good of a job of waking me up at my request, to going the extra mile in ensuring I'm well taken care of, all of the staff here (Simon is lovely!) is a cut above the rest. Thoroughly loved my stay here and will be staying again during my next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,08,16
215,Another excellent trip,We have stayed at the Alex numerous times over the years. Excellent location and staff always make the stay special. ,5,2024,08,16
215,Amazing stay at The Alex!,"An amazing hotel made better by a great staff! The rooms, accommodations and breakfast were top notch. The difference was Simon who checked us in on our first day and made us feel like family the whole stay. He went above and beyond for us. We would 100% book at The Alex again.",5,2024,08,16
215,A great place to stay!,"I had a great time at The Alex Hotel. Wonderful food, drinks, and staff. The people at the front desk were always so friendly and helpful, whether it be booking a cab or food recommendations, they would always greet us kindly! We loved the chocolate caramel candies and when they were out on our last day Simon made sure we left with treats!",5,2024,08,15

215,"Outstanding service, especially Simon",The hotel was very clean. Customer service was outstanding. Food was delicious and Simon was the best. We were able to check in early and the customer service really was great throughout our entire stay. We will definitely return and recommend this hotel to everyone we know who is visiting Ireland.,5,2024,08,14
215,"Great food, great service","Great customer service and easy check in process. I know it‚Äôs not guaranteed, but I was pleasantly surprised to have my room ready when I arrived about 10am. I really enjoyed my impromptu dinner in the restaurant and Jessica gave wonderful recommendations. I appreciated her answering my questions and recommending the delicious sweet potato fries and also the yummy panna cotta. Sometimes I find hotels are a bit stuffy towards business passengers, but Jessica was extremely welcoming and took great care of me during my meal. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be back again during my stay!",5,2024,08,12
215,Wonderful newer hotel with great staff and modern appointments,We had hiked for two weeks throughout Ireland.  This hotel capped off our wonderful adventure to Ireland.  The rooms were spacious and well appointed.  The hotel front desk staff were very helpful in assisting us with our last 24 hours in Dublin.  ,5,2024,08,12
215,Luxury Hotel Close to Everything,"This was a hotel that lives up to its ratings! The sleek design makes it feel clean and modern without being cold‚Äîmore of a 30s vibe. Very comfortable room, great breakfast, lots of little extras (including water in the fridge, tea and coffee in the room, and a welcome box of chocolates). Easy walk to the historic sites - Merrion Square, museums, and Trinity. Staff was top-notch and very helpful. We'll be back!",5,2024,08,12
215,Excellent Hotel,We spent three nights here and enjoyed our stay very much.   Lovely room and great amenities and great location.   Staff was fantastic.

215,Helpful and kind,"Fantastic service - Murilo at the front desk helped me out enormously - he was knowledgable and kind and funny. He‚Äôs also really good at Maths. 
The hotel is lovely and in a great spot. 
Excellent customer service making a good stay - great!
Thanks",5,2024,08,09

215,Great time at The Alex,My stay at The Alex was wonderful! The amenities are great and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Alvaro from staff took great care of my friends and I. Our requests were quickly handled. We are super thankful to The Alex for making our stay a great time. 10/10 hotel and memorable experience in Dublin.,5,2024,08,07
215,Pleasure visit,All staff were accommodating and very friendly however Murilo and Simon stood out.  Made our visit very memorable and relaxing,5,2024,08,06
215,You won‚Äôt be disappointed,"Absolutely wonderful stay. Very clean rooms and Murillo and Anais at reception were so helpful and friendly. The upgrade was a pleasant surprise on arrival, thank you. Dinner and breakfast were also great. Close to the two parks in Dublin and the river. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,08,06
215,Dublin,"Very beautiful hotel, central situation, parking, all confort, good breakfast, quiet room, very good communication ",5,2024,08,06
215,Great stay at The Alex,"We are wrapping up four nights at The Alex and it has been an outstanding experience. First and foremost, the enthusiastic, gracious and helpful reception team of Karen, Karen, Anaise and Barry have gone above and beyond to make our time at The Alex a lovely experience.   They followed  up after check in and made sure we had everything we needed and that our rooms were to our liking. They were gracious about needing to re-issue keys when we locked ourselves out, they made sure we were all set with breakfast, and they were happy to help with luggage storage before and after check-in and check-out. These may seem like things all hotels should able to accommodate, but I can‚Äôt tell you the number of times staff at other hotels have seemed irritated by such seemingly simple requests. 

Rooms: the rooms are modern classic in design, thoughtfully and comfortably laid out, well stocked with coffee, tea, and water, and exceptionally clean.   We travel to Dublin frequently and have stayed in at least 5 or 6 other hotels in this price point and The Alex has been the best value hands down. 

Location: The Hotel is very near Merrion Square and easily walkable to the National Gallery, Trinity College, the Pearse Street Station, Stephen‚Äôs Green, etc. while also being very quiet. 

We‚Äôve had a great stay and will absolutely stay here again!",5,2024,08,05
215,Paul and Barb's Vacation,We enjoyed our stay at the Alex hotel.  Staff was friendly and hotel is clean and well kept.  Not more than a 15-minute walk to the shopping and entertainment areas.  Bathroom could have been a tad bigger but overall was fine.,5,2024,08,05
215,Dining experience,"We went yesterday for dinner in the Alex Hotel and had the pleasure of dining in the Secret Garden. We were welcomed by friendly staff. The food,  service and atmosphere were outstanding. Secret Garden's  decor invites you in a cozy comfortable space with soft lightening and music. Thank you, Andreea, Kenny and the team. 
Catalina and Amandio Baptista.",5,2024,08,05
215,Favorite hotel in Dublin,"Great boutique hotel. Really convenient location, super comfortable beds and clean rooms. Best part is the staff - they take care of you very well. Special shout out to Murilo who provided exceptional service and great guidance on what to do while I was in Dublin! ",5,2024,08,03
215,The place to stay in Dublin - Great for families!!,"We had an amazing stay at The Alex Hotel! This was our first trip to Dublin and I can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else when I/we go back. The suite we had was plenty of space for the three of us and included a bed brought in for our son. The hotel is conveniently located to so many coffee shops, restaurants, pubs, museums, parks, and other tourist sites. It‚Äôs also close enough to a major train station but not so close that you can hear the trains! The restaurant on site is wonderful and we enjoyed the plentiful options for breakfast everyday. There is also a coffee shop connected on site which we appreciated as well. 

Lastly, the staff was perfect. They were so welcoming and friendly from our checkin through to our checkout. They offered tips on restaurants as well as assistance with taxis and how best to use public transportation. 

Highly highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling and especially for those traveling with families!",5,2024,08,02
215,Lovely Alex hotel.,"Wonderful clean hotel.
Food very good.
Staff approachable and friendly and will go the extra mile.
Beds very comfortable. 
No noise thankfully at night.
Only complaint if you can call it that, is difficulty with television channels that you cannot connect with.
Sweets are provided too at the reception which is a nice touch",5,2024,07,31
215,Chic and cozy!,"Such a gorgeous hotel with incredible staff! Simon was super hospitable and even organized our taxi ride to the airport.  Will definitely be back. So chic and cozy! The decor is very nice, convenient location and the bar is a total vibe. Fave hotel in Dublin!",5,2024,07,30
215,"Outstanding well-located hotel, great value","This was our first visit to Dublin and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay.  Our junior suite was Modern, spacious and clean.  It included every amenity we needed.  The access to the executive lounge on the 6th floor was a big bonus - well-stocked with free items including snacks, wine, beer, coffee and tea.  
The location of the hotel was perfect with almost every place we wanted to visit within easy walking distance.  The staff were uniformly courteous and helpful.  Our bed was phenomenal - so much so that we asked the staff for the brand as we may purchase one for our home.
A few very minor things detracted only very slightly from an overall fantastic stay:
The room layout was a little weird with the bed right next to the door, so that hallway noise was more apparent in the bedroom area than in the separate room.  
A door or other separator between the two rooms would have facilitated the early riser among us using the light in the living area without disturbing the late sleeper.  
The executive suite could have longer hours - but really no complaint there as we could always grab something during opening hours to take away. ",5,2024,07,30
215,Our Stay in Dublin,Everything about The Alex was perfect.  I would definitely visit again.  Wonderful!  The Alex has a staff of warm and welcoming people.  ,5,2024,07,30
215,"Exceptional location, great sleep, and best service.",The hotel is near transportation and food. The beds are super comfortable. The staff is exceptional. Would certainly recommend staying there. You can walk most anywhere. The no only stores our luggage but put it in the room when the room was ready.,5,2024,07,29
215,GOOD EXPERIENCE AT THE SECRET GARDEN,"Amazing bunch with friends at the secret garden, excelente vegan option and really tasty!!! 
The service and staff absolutely efficient and smiling all the time.  
Thank you very much to Eduardo from Panama and Jessica from Mexico they were very kind and nice to us. 
The admosphere is so calm and very cute place.",5,2024,07,28
215,Will stay with this Hotel again in Dublin next time,"The hotel was clean and pretty with friendly staff.  We rented the Alex Suite with access to the hotel lounge (great complimentary coffee, tea, wine, soda and beer). The Suite was spacious and the bed and pillow were fluffy.  The hotel staff, Simon, was particular super helpful when we were checking out by offering to call us a taxi for the airport because it will be much faster than uber apps in Dublin.",5,2024,07,28
215,Amazing Hotel!,"The Alex Hotel was an amazing place to stay. My wife and I and another couple stayed 10 nights. The service and professionalism was impeccable!  The staff took care of our every need. Especially Murillo who set up all of our reservations, greeted us when we came in daily, and made sure we were comfortable. Simon was such a pleasure, so friendly and usually the first person we would see in the morning. He always made us feel so welcome. Karen was also helpful with our needs such as laundry or any amenity we needed. Jamie the operations manager made sure everything ran smoothly and our rooms were taken care of.
Our rooms were comfortable and roomy and the beds were comfortable. If you needed extra pillows, blankets, towels that was never a problem and handled immediately. I would recommend you book a room with access to the executive lounge where you could grab a drink or snacks throughout the day at no additional cost. Daily breakfast was fresh with a good variety on a daily basis. We can whole heartedly recommend this hotel. Centrally located and pretty much within walking distance of whatever you are doing. Pubs, train stations and city center. The workout facility is the best I've ever had access to at a hotel. We give a huge thanks to The Alex Hotel!!!",5,2024,07,26
215,The Alex‚Äôs Beds Make you Sink,"The Alex is a cute hotel. The beds are so comfortable, you sink right in for a restful nights sleep. The room is large enough to accommodate 2 adults without feeling like you are crowded. Every morning I‚Äôd go to the little cafe attached to the hotel for tea and a lovely croissant ü•ê‚Ä¶ so yummy! Simon and K. Michell at the front desk were very helpful. Simon made sure I got the gym and shared some of the most delicious chocolates with me. The entire staff was excellent! I highly recommend.",5,2024,07,26
215,Family trip,Stayed in the family room/suite. Very satisfied. Having the attached living room for our daughter was a huge plus and gave us a place to hang out. ,5,2024,07,23
215,Beautiful Stay!,"The Alex staff and hotel was wonderful! Simon went above and beyond to make sure that we felt welcome. The rooms were fantastic as well! My only downside was that the air conditioning did not work very well, but and Irish day with the windows open worked just fine. The Alex was within good walking distance of a lot of great pubs, Trinity College, and the Temple Bar area as well.",4,2024,07,18
215,Lovely Hotel and Family Friendly,"We (11 family members from 17 years to 80 years old) arrived at the lovely Alex Hotel tired and a bit confused. The staff was friendly and helpful in getting us oriented to Dublin, loaning us chargers for our electronics, providing directions to museums etc, even had candy jars on the counters to provide a yummy snack. Food in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was delicious and of enough variety to please everyone in our group. It's location was very convenient too.",5,2024,07,15
215,Sim√≥n was absolutely fantastic!!,"A huge thank you to Sim√≥n from Chile, who was absolutely amazing! He looked after us and was so so friendly and kind! We can't thank him enough! Such a lovely person :) 
Our stay a true Alex was just fabulous! What a gorgeous room. Absolutely loved our visit!!",5,2024,07,13
215,"Clean, stylish hotel, good vibes, great location","The facade and lobby of The Alex are lovely, and the location is excellent for Trinity, Christ Church, the national art gallery, green spaces, Grafton Street shops, lots of excellent dining options, and certainly lots more within walking distance. Besides being friendly and charming, the staff in this cosmopolitan hotel is very responsive to requests (extra coffee pods for the Nespresso machine, extra towels, more bath tissue, etc.) and actually politely refused tips. We didn't dine in the hotel, but we did get drinks at the bar and take them up to our room to relax and enjoy the view (our room was on the 4th floor). Comfortably sized, stylish room with very comfortable (firm) beds and modernly decorated and outfitted bathroom. Bonus that the window actually opened, and we enjoyed the cool weather and cute seagulls from it. There was one very small issue that is likely just a personal preference but we'll mention anyway. If you are used to having air conditioning making your room on the chilly side: Though we kept the thermostat at its lowest setting (18 C), the room sometimes felt ""room temperature"" and a little humid. Otherwise, all excellent. Also, in Google Maps, when you look at the location of the hotel, you may see a photograph of an industrial building with a fence and gate topped with razor wire. Though apprehensive about this adjacent building, we booked our room, and we were happy to see when we arrived that this industrial building is the anomaly in the neighborhood and, actually, is a bit charming in real life. We're very happy that we stayed here and plan to do so again on our next trip to Dublin. Our thanks to Simon and the rest of the staff! ",5,2024,07,12
215,Great experience,"Everything was great. Excellent location, great room. Larger than expected for Europe, Particularly impressive was the greeting we received even though our arrival was close to midnight. Simon was waiting for us and honestly acted like we were longtime friends. Fabulous greeting. Also, Actelina (not certain of the spelling) was fabulous in keeping the bar open to allow us a little time to unwind after the long trip.  I would also like to thank Murilo, Karen and Kenny for being so helpful and friendly. All in all, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever encountered a staff who seemed so genuinely cheerful and happy. 
Jim",5,2024,07,12
215,The Alex Hotel,"Booked the hotel for a night in Dublin and what a fantastic experience. The staff could not have been more friendly, the room was perfect and the breakfast superb (very extensive choice). 
The hotel location is great in accessing the city centre. All in all a great night away - we will be back! ",5,2024,07,10
215,Perfect Hotel and Location,The Alex is a perfect respite within the Heart of Dublin. We had a long journey and it provided us everything that we could need. Simon in particular was a great and made sure that me and my family were comfortable. Incredibly hospitable. Great choice!,5,2024,07,09
215,Perfect Stay in Dublin!,"Absolutely beautiful hotel with great customer service.  We enjoyed every aspect of our stay - the room was clean and comfy, the staff was super nice and helpful, and the Secret Garden restaurant was delicious.  I highly recommend this place when visiting Dublin!",5,2024,07,08
215,Great hotel. Great location.,"A very clean, warm and welcoming hotel. Beds are very comfortable. Great location to the city centre. Would definitely be back. ",5,2024,07,06
215,Nice Hotel,"Murilo - front desk agent - charming individual. Excellent symbol for the hotel. Stylish, warm, welcoming. Nicely appointed rooms, professional staff. Hood location in town, not too far from anything. Couldn‚Äôt find umbrellas/doorman when needed. I got rained on in Dublin?",5,2024,07,05
215,GREAT  AMBIENCE,"This hotel was really nice & I liked the Asthetics really much. Simon at Reception was amazing and very helpful. The gym was amazing, and the vibe was so nice. Well located too. Everything looked visually pleasing and clean. Will visit again.",5,2024,07,05
215,Great stay,We stayed in The Alex to check out Dublin as a venue for a conference in 2026. We enjoyed our stay a lot. The beds were very comfortable and at breakfast we could choose from a wide variety of delicious dishes and drinks.,5,2024,07,04
215,Concert weekend with the family,"We traveled in for a long weekend for a big concert (TS). Excellent location for Aviva but also close to Dublin City Center/Trinity/train/etc. The hotel was festive for the concert weekend but was not over the top for non attendees. We had young adults/late teens/early 20s as well as 40 somethings and was a great spot for all of us. They had themed cupcakes at check in and friendship bracelets for the kids. Murilo and Simon- both at the desk went out of their way for us and we were very pleased overall with the service. Will certainly return to this property when visiting Dublin (we have also stayed at the Davenport, a sister property, which is nice as well but this was more our vibe!)",4,2024,07,02
215,The Alex,"Very nice and modern Hotel. The staff were very helpful especially the young lady who assisted with me setting up a rental car return so I would not have to take it back to airport. Her name"" Anais"" I believe. In addition the restaurant were also excellent.",5,2024,07,01
215,Grateful for this little gem in a busy city,"A great hotel stay for us.  There were three of us and we had a suite - there was plenty of room for our luggage and for us to move about.  The room was well appointed and the bottled water was refreshed each day which I appreciated.  You will need an engineering degree to operate the coffee maker, which is annoying - so that has to go.  But other than that, we had everything we needed.  This is a typical European bedroom layout, with no coversheet - just a fitted sheet and a comforter.  But there are at least some layers between you and the mattress, and all bedding was clean.  The shower was set up terribly, and the bathroom overall dark, but the rest of the suite is fantastic; light, bright, and comfortable.  The staff was friendly, the breakfast was lovely, and the location cannot be beat.",5,2024,07,01
215,Amazing stay,"We highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Dublin.  We were there for the Taylor Swift Eras tour and they added to our excitement with her music in the lobby , cupcakes and friendship bracelets!!",5,2024,06,30
215,Fantastic service,"Loved the modern design of the hotel rooms which were spacious and comfortable by my standards. The staff went the extra mile to look out for me, whether it was at check-in/ out, when I had requests (e.g. food after hours) or when dining in the restaurants. I had a brilliant stay and would return. Shout to to my man Simon for being a great host. ",5,2024,06,29
215,Great hotel with friendly staff,"Our stay at The Alex was great! The location is extremely close to all popular locations in Dublin and the hotel was very clean and rooms were well appointed.

Simon made our night! After a long night at TSwift concert he greeted us with a bright smile and excitement to hear about the night. Brought waters and chocolate to finish our night with a much needed treat. The rest of the staff was kind as well, but Simon truly went the extra mile and I will be sure to recommend your hotel because of his kindness!!!!",5,2024,06,29
215,excellent stay and helpful staff,This is an excellent hotel with a good central Dublin location.  The buffet breakfast has a lot of options and is very good.  Rooms are spacious and quiet.  Murilo at the front desk was very helpful and gracious.  We will definitely stay there again.,5,2024,06,27
215,Great Hotel in Dublin,"The Alex Hotel was our last stop in a 2-week vacation around southern and western Ireland.  it is located a little off the beaten track in Dublin, which is nice because you can walk a couple of blocks and get out of the hustle and bustle if you want.  You can tell that the area around The Alex is undergoing some gentrification, but that does not stop The Alex from attracting travelers, groups, and business events.

The Alex bills itself more like a boutique full-service.  It is well appointed, well maintained, and very modern.  There is a small takeaway cafe attached to the reception area with its own street access.  It is a good place for specialty coffee, pastries, and pre-made fruit cups, overnight oats, sandwiches, and the like.

We arrived at The Alex about 2 hours before check-in time, and they gladly held our luggage for us (properly tagged and secured in a separate room) while we returned our rental car (you really don't want to drive around Dublin if you don't have to).  After we returned to car, we returned to the Alex and had a late lunch at their outdoor cafe.  Lunch there was tasty and appropriately priced for a city hotel restaurant.

We had breakfast and a light dinner in their restaurant.  Breakfast was served buffet style and had a very wide selection of items.  Dinner was good and large  portions (salads and a side of chips).  

The Alex is nicely located.  A block away is a DART station (commuter train to points outside of Dublin).  Right on the corner across the street is a pub called The Ginger Man.  We did not eat or drink there, but every day right around quitting time, they had quite the crowd of people standing and drinking along the sidewalk and into the street a bit.

https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186605-d696230-Reviews-The_Ginger_Man_Pub-Dublin_County_Dublin.html

On the other side of the same block (straight down from the Alex) is Kennedy's Pub.  We ate there and had a good meal.  Very crowded!

Our room was comfortable and clean.  The staff refreshed it well.  We like the hotel because it allowed us to walk easily to places like the Trinity College campus and the Temple Bar area and still be able to get to all the unique and historic neighborhood pubs.

Lastly, the day before we checked out, we asked  The Alex to request a taxi for us to Dublin Airport.  The staff had the taxi there for us at the appointed time.",5,2024,06,26

We arrived from Iceland this morning hours before normal check-in time and my wife was  feeling very ill. It pained me to see her in this much distress.  The staff at the front desk were able to get us into a room  immediately. They were very gracious and accommodating . I would also like to recognize Zion for his help later in the day.

215,Ten star staff,"The staff is wonderful. My husband was here on business and I flew in toward the end of his trip to have a little vacation. The staff not only are friendly and helpful, they have gone above and beyond for us. Last night we asked if we would be able to grab a pastry a minute or two before 7am because we had an early tour. They said absolutely. When we came down, Sim√≥n had not only grabbed us a pastry, but he packed us individual bags with the most well balanced individual breakfast. This made our day.  The hotel is clean, comfortable, quiet and beautiful with delicious breakfast each day. Don‚Äôt forget to order a cappuccino when you arrive to breakfast. You can walk anywhere from this location with plenty of pubs & restaurants nearby.  The other staff were incredible as well. The gentleman (Morello) I probably have his name wrong, who had mentioned he is originally from Brazil, was so kind and helpful as well. To date, this trip has been the friendliest I have ever experienced.",5,2024,06,10
215,Nice Stay,"Very nice modern hotel. Stayed once at Davenport, across way but wanted to enjoy something different. Restaurant very nice, staff is excellent. Room and beds comfy, can use large gym facility across the way.  Only issue, no view of anything but a rooftop..",4,2024,06,09
215,Luxury,"The location is very nice, although we were only there one night, so we didn‚Äôt venture far.

215,It ok,"Rooms are very comfortable clean and spacious, in an excellent area, walking distance to main attractions.
Why the low rating? It‚Äôs the little things that make a special visit. Staff efficient but disinterested, housekeeping ‚Ä¶ the passages strewn with laundry, messy during duty times. Didn‚Äôt replace body wash, soap or lotion. 
I‚Äôd say lacked care.",3,2024,06,08
215,Friendly Staff with luxury accomodations.,I would like to recognize the following individuals on the hotel staff: Daphne and Sara were very friendly at checkout. Sara went out of her way to help us with our language and walked us a block down the street to the park house. Thank you Sara :).In all a very pleasant stay.,5,2024,06,06
215,Great stay at The Alex!,"We had an excellent stay at the Alex Hotel.  The location is top-notch.  The room was well-appointed and very clean and comfortable.  We ate a tasty lunch in the Secret Garden where Andreea served us promptly, and was very friendly and knowledgable.",5,2024,06,03

The location is so close to Trinity College and wonderful museums. We loved it and would go back again with enthusiasm. ",5,2024,05,31
215,"The Alex Hotel is outstanding. Family friendly, excellent service, location, clean and modern.","I visited here with my husband and 1 year old and our stay was wonderful. Daphne at the front desk was very accommodating and a kind woman staff member I can't remember the name of, was able to get us a seamless early check-in after a long red-eye flight. When we got to our room, a travel cot was made up neatly for our little one exactly as requested. We found the bed to be very comfortable, the room was clean, and the cleaning staff was diligent and thorough with turnover service each day. One of the cleaning staff members even helped us with carry a bag to the elevator when leaving. We opted to stay for breakfast each day we were there and found the selection delicious, with fresh juices made each morning. Abdul was our waiter each morning and he not only was very accommodating with high chairs for our little one, but also makes the very best cappuccinos.  We chose to eat dinner at The Alex one evening and there was a woman manager who was also very helpful switching our orders in takeaway boxes when our 1 year old couldn't sit for dinner and needed to head upstairs. All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised that every single team member we interacted with was incredibly welcoming, accommodating and helpful. The only issue we had was our room was too hot in the evenings. The front desk staff had our AC checked out promptly the next day, gave us a fan and we cracked a window at night which was comfortable as it was May. It's possible that it was just our room. The location was close to shops and pubs, but far enough away that it was quiet. I loved our stay at this hotel and will certainly return in the future. Thank you to all the staff at The Alex for making our stay so outstanding.",5,2024,05,29
215,Quality Hotel,The room was spacious with an extra large bed that was very comfortable. Blackout curtains were the best I've ever had at any hotel. Also appreciated all the outlets. Lighting was a bit poor in the bathroom and bedroom making it hard to apply makeup.  Service at breakfast could have been a little better. We were offered tea or coffee coming into the dining area and didn't realize we could order a cappuccino until another guest did so. The continental breakfast itself was very good with a large variety of options to choose from.,4,2024,05,27
215,A very pleasent stay,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Alex. The staff was very helpful, the breakfast was great and we found that the location was perfect for our stay in Dublin.

215,Great stay at the Alex in Dublin.,"We had a wonderful time at the Alex Hotel, Dublin.  Central location, easy to get to and from, and a great staff.  Room was quiet, spacious and up to date. 

In particular I‚Äôd like to specifically call out Adelina in the hotel Bar.  She heard that one of our group were having a special birthday and she arranged for a treat being sent to their room.  Very sweet. Additionally, very knowledgeable about Irish whiskey, which was great as my friend, who has a passion for whiskey, was tasting a broad variety and she helped guide the way.

We will definitely stay at the Alex on our next visit.",5,2024,05,17
215,Great staff,"Staff are amazing, from our check in experience to dining.  We arrived early due to flight schedules, and the reception staff worked to get us in our rooms early and close together.

215,Striking and comfortable mid-century styled hotel,"Fantastic stay at a recently reburnished hotel, done in mid-century style. I stayed in a king sized room and the bed was perfect, the decor lush and the shower wonderful (my room had shower only, not bath). Despite the hotel being busy, the rooms were quiet and all staff attentive and helpful. The breakfast in the hotel had lots of choice of hot and cold foods, fruit and pastries, and was very tasty, with excellent barista-made coffee. The hotel is a 1 minute walk from Meirion Square (Oscar Wilde) Park and Trinity College and 10 minutes walk from Temple Bar. A brilliant place to base yourself for a weekend or short stay in Dublin.",5,2024,05,06
215,Great upscale hotel in a good location!,"Upscale hotel that knows how to take care of its guests!  We stayed in April and May of 2024.  This is a well-located hotel - close enough to Temple Bar but not IN Temple Bar, which is good if you don't necessarily want to be in the middle of everything.  A block from Trinity College, it's a great place to stay for city-walking.  The breakfast buffet was terrific, and Zion and Anais at the front desk are TOP NOTCH!",5,2024,05,05
215,Incredible Hotel,"I am so happy I chose the Alex hotel. My friend and I only stayed for one night but boy was it special! We were chosen as the guests of honor, but even before that the service from all staff members was remarkable. We were made to feel so special and I highly recommend staying here when in Dublin.",5,2024,05,01
215,"Great hotel, great location","Was greeted by Daphne who was extremely helpful. She even came to the parking garage to make sure we got in with no issues.

The Alex in Dublin is a great hotel, with beautiful rooms, and great dining options - the breakfast buffet was excellent.

We had a great stay with many activities and attractions within walking distance or a short cab ride. Will definitely stay at The Alex again!",5,2024,04,30
215,Great stay at the Alex Hotel,"We were welcomed by Anais and Murilo who managed to check us in early after an overnight flight. Our whole experience was exceptional.

215,We‚Äôll be back!,"The Alex was a great - beautiful furnishings and ergonomically designed with lights and charging stations in convenient placement. The bed and pillows were super comfortable. If you‚Äôd like additional pillows or different firmness, they‚Äôve got it. 

The hotel‚Äôs location is ideal!  Two blocks from the beauty of Trinity College, and we often walked over to Henry St shopping and Temple Bar. We walked to a theater show‚Ä¶just super convenient!  And walking back across Trinity campus was the icing on the cake each evening. 

They‚Äôre very environmentally friendly which means you might want to pack a washcloth or request extra towels. Aside from wishing we had a loofa, it‚Äôs hard to think of anything we don‚Äôt love about our accommodations. We  absolutely plan to stay at The Alex again in the future. 

PS - we stayed at The Alex for their room size, but were blown away by fitness center at their sister-hotel, The Mont, just a block away. ",5,2024,04,27
215,Lovely April Stay in The Alex,Really nice and well presented hotel in a great city. The staff were very helpful and attentive and the room felt special.,5,2024,04,24
215,Stylish and Modern Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"I'd recommend staying at The Alex Hotel in Dublin, which is conveniently located in a quiet section of the city near Trinity College and Merrion Square. It's about a 15 minute walk from the Temple Bar District, which did admittedly get a little tiresome late at night. The hotel design is stylish and modern, and the standard king room was extremely spacious for a city room. The front desk staff, especially Robson, were lovely and accommodating. The only notable cons of this hotel were 1) the pillows and mattress were not very comfortable and 2) the coffee shop located inside the hotel was not open on weekends, which was surprising and inconvenient.",5,2024,04,22
215,great stay,"Wonderful hotel.  rooms are beautifully appointed.  Modern, but also classic feel.  Very pleasant work space in the lobby.  Walking distance to everything.",5,2024,04,20

They were right there to call a taxi, de feather our room due to allergies, and even post our postcards home on our way out.  Highly recommend!",5,2024,04,14
215,Wonderful experience ,"Great location.
Very modern & spotlessly clean & quiet. 
Super friendly and obliging staff, especially the front desk guys ,
Zion & Mario.
Great breakfast too.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone.
We'll be back for sure.
So close to Grafton Street  & the National Gallery ",5,2024,04,08
215,Wonderful family break,"We had three generations of the family on a vacation in Dublin.  The Alex proved to be the perfect location with the most professional and personable team. The facilities and food topped it all off.  It was a combination of good quality and good value for money.   All in all, it made for a memorable stay and our thanks to all.",5,2024,04,07

From the moment we arrived, staff were so attentive and we were seated in a lovely quite alcove, where we could chat easily.  The food was lovely, with everyone happy with their meal. I particularly like to mention Adelina and Matina who were so pleasant.  We enjoyed it so much we are coming back again for our meet up in May, this could become a regular venue for us.  So thanks so much to everyone.",5,2024,04,06
215,Mostly happy,We mostly loved the hotel. Good location for walking/taxi. Great staff. Bar and restaurant which is a must and the food was very tasty. The A/C is a joke. Seriously! Didn‚Äôt cool the room at all-glad we were there in March and could open the window. 2 bath towels.,5,2024,04,05
215,Really nice stay and value for the location,"The Alex is a great value for the location. Very clean, great staff / service. Design is a bit sterile but very clean. Restaurants are OK. Dinner / lunch menu is average. But breakfast was great! Great location. ",4,2024,03,31
215,Average stay for a high price,"Expected more for the price. Had 2 rooms for 3 nights. Ended up on 1st floor. Lots of street noise as it was St Patrick's Day weekend. One room was right above the front door to the hotel so our sons had very little sleep. The other room had a view of the trash cans across the street. Nespresso machine did not work and toilet didn't flush fully. Notified maid about the toilet and she said that it wasn't flushing correctly and would have someone check on it. Not sure that happened as it didn't improve. Had a separate reservation for our 3rd day which we informed the front desk at our check in on Saturday morning. When we returned to our rooms on Monday afternoon, our keys didn't work. Went to the front desk to inform them about our keys and the gentleman at the front desk asked us if we were sure that we had a reservation vs. ""Our apologies. Let me check your reservation details"". As noted, expected more for the price and from all of the rave reviews on this site.",3,2024,03,30
215,Great place to stay!,"Staff were fantastic and the room was exceptionally clean, spacious and very well decor.

215,Outstanding service from check in to dining to check out.,"Zion helped us check in and assisted us in getting an upgraded suite. 

Unfortunately, our check in was delayed due to some guests arguing with a credit card policy. Barry the manager came out and was able to take those guests aside and diffuse the matter while we were able to continue our check in. We love Barry. He‚Äôs the man. He was always assisting guests or other staff and monitoring the areas in a dedicated way. 

We loved the handwritten note and chocolates. The Alex staff has always made our stay special. 

We were able to dine in and our server Marina was positively amazing. She provided prime service and assisted us in choosing the best item to eat which we loved. 

Kenny and Chelsea also provided amazing service. You could feel there was a team aspect to the service. 

Chelsea also led us to the secret garden and we were able to take some photos and enjoy the flowers.

The Alex is one of the most positive guests experiences you can have at a hotel and we look forward to staying there every time we visit the fair city of Dublin!",5,2024,03,25
215,Wonderful stay at The Alex,"My family and I had a lovely stay at the Alex. The hotel was clean, comfortable and modern, with well appointed rooms and comfy beds. Everything was perfect. However, the thing that most impressed me was the hospitality shown to us by every staff member we encountered. From the moment we arrived after our trans-Atlantic flight,  they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, from bringing us a pot of hot tea while we waited for our room to offering us dishes and cutlery when we arrived with a pizza one evening. That kind of feeling is impossible to put a value on. Once again, thanks to everyone at the Alex who made our stay so special. We will be back.",5,2024,03,24
215,the alex,"great hotel and location.

great staff and food.

the air conditioning is a major issue, if you want cold no chance. if you want hot then it's fine.

hot breakfast was cold in serving trays.

all in all it is a great place. the above were just my particular frustrations.",5,2024,03,22
215,Perfect location,"We had an amazing time at the Alex! The location was perfect, the staff was very accommodating with our couple of requests and the beds were sooo comfy! We will absolutely stay here again the next time we are in Dublin! ",5,2024,03,19
215,The Alex,"Very professional staff from day 1 for my stay during a busy business week. Tried the restaurant in the Mont (same owner as the Alex) which was very good. Also the gym was excellent with all the cardio and weights one could ask, will go back to this hotel again for sure.",5,2024,03,17
215,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","We loved the modern and luxe decor and feel of this hotel. The rooms were wonderfully appointed and comfortable beds.

215,Lies,"We booked 4 rooms for 2 nights over St Patricks Weekend.
The cost was ‚Ç¨4080.
We arrived at midday on the 16th. Rooms weren‚Äôt ready but we all checked in and left our bags.
We arrived back at 1.00am on the morning of the 17th to be told that we only had 3 rooms; not 4.
Because . . . A PREGNANT WOMAN CAME INTO THE HOTEL, WENT INTO LABOUR AND NEEDED A HOTEL ROOM. 
I never been told so much lies in all my life.
Our colleague then had to leave the hotel to find another room.
We were told that they would only refund 1 night and that he could come back tomorrow.
I have never witnessed anything like this in all my life.",1,2024,03,16
215,Comfortable Stay for Dublin City Trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Alex Hotel in Dublin. Rooms were very comfortable, especially the bed was great and cozy. Room size was perfect and room offered everything that we needed. Staff was very nice and always helpful. Room cleaning could be a bit improved, the shelves and wardrobes were kind of dusty. But all in all we liked this hotel a lot and we would definitely recommend! ",5,2024,03,15
215,Amazing service and room.,Staff are amazing. Got to the hotel early and got us in our room early. Gave us all the information needed to make our stay enjoyable. Breakfast was amazing. It was our first night of our honeymoon and in our room there was a nice note and treats.,5,2024,03,14

215,Wonderful visit to Dublin,"Really enjoyed our stay at The Alex. We had a room on the front which was quiet and didn‚Äôt hear much from outside. The room was huge especially the bed and so comfy! Had all the facilities we needed like hairdryer, mini fridge, Nespresso coffee machine and free waters. Great to leave luggage on check in/check out. Room was clean and just loved the luxury decor of the hotel. Used the great gym facilities at the sister hotel The Mont round the corner. In a great location to the centre of Dublin. We walked and I think it would be like 15/20 mins dependent on where you wanted to go and the area around the hotel felt safe. The Dublin express from the airport was conveniently around the corner for the drop off/pick up. Would really recommend to stay here!

Only downside would be the very late check in at 4pm",5,2024,03,07
215,Great hotel and staying here again,"Add towel racks and put a gym in the basement ‚Äî there are 2 hooks in the bathroom to hang things on.  Wet towels, wet facecloths, Change of clothes . . . Out of luck.  No sliding door to close in the shower looks cool, but consequently no matter how much you try, water gets all over the bathroom floor.  These seem really trivial, but a couple of towel bars would go a long way. Also. The gym facility was really great; however, if you go during the day you will have to navigate a couple
Of really busy intersections to get to it.  It‚Äôs not far, but it still requires me to have to leave the property to work out.  Again, this is a minor issue, but petty annoyance is a distraction and leads to my overall experience.  Other than that, the staff was exceptional, the hotel cleanliness was impeccable and I would highly recommend this property to anyone traveling to Dublin ",5,2024,03,03
215,Stay at The Alex,"Really pleasant stay at The Alex on a recent business trip. Lovely room and super clean. The staff everywhere were really friendly and attentive, especially at reception and the restaurant. Hotel has use of a fab gym just across the road in a sister Hotel.

215,Business trip to Dublin ,"Classy, well equipped and optimally positioned hotel. Very convenient! The restaurant is pretty good too, not too large of s menu, but has everything you'd look forward to trying if you're in Dublin for a few days.

215,The most amazing staff. Especially Karen!,Absolutely fantastic hotel. Couldn't have done anymore for us. Unfortunately needed some sanitary towels at 10.30pm and called reception. KAREN on the desk didn't have any from the hotel but said she had a few of her own in her bag and brought them up to our room - wouldn't accept any money. The most lovely woman and an asset to the hotel.,5,2024,02,08

Beautiful newly renovated rooms and very pleasant and welcoming staff. If I'm back in Dublin I will definitely return.

215,An All-Time Favorite,"Not my first time at the hotel, but the first time I booked a room and have been able to share feedback... I came in late after a conference because I wanted to unwind somewhere familiar before my flight home early the next morning.

215,Nice place.,"I visited the Alex hotel for a night out and away with my girls, I have to say the place looks clean and well maintained, but our night wouldn‚Äôt be so memorable if not the outstanding service from a barman Jeff! He has been very helpful explaining to us the difference between drinks we were interested in, to around the location recommendations for our next day. It‚Äôs very rare you meet such a fun, professional and work passionate barman nowadays. Our drinks were prepared with special care and mister Jeff has been a true gentleman. 10 out of 10 recommended this place.",5,2024,01,12

215,Honeymoon stay,"Had a great stay at The Alex for our first stop on our honeymoon, the check in experience was good and allowed us to get in early due to room being ready which was amazing after 26 hours of flying, breakfast had a great selection, the gym was well maintained with good equipment, lovely staff and lots of close-by pubs.

215,Not the wedding experience I was hoping for,"The design of the Alex hotel is very cool and has beautiful art deco touches throughout, however, it's lacking function in a lot of areas. 

We stayed at the suite for 3 nights, for the night before, night of, and night after our wedding. We booked the suite for the 3 nights as a special treat and were very excited. 

On arrival we were disappointed that the hotel didn't mention our upcoming celebration and the room not only had no special added touches but we were also lacking basics expected even in a standard room such as bath robes and bath foam for the bath. The room was noisy as it overlooks the gingerman pub so we found it difficult to get any sleep over the 3 nights and overall the staff were very mixed with the housekeeping staff being super helpful but the reception staff lacking warmth that you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. 

A disappointing experience overall and would not recommend for celebrating a special occasion. ",3,2024,01,03
215,Love the Alex!,"This was our second stay at the Alex. We stayed the first time in the fall of 2021 and were very impressed. Since we were visiting Ireland again, we decided to give it another shot and it did not disappoint! Hotel is modern and clean with beautiful decor. Rooms are spacious with comfortable beds and USB plugs on both sides. Breakfast is good and there are vegan options which I appreciate. The hotel is close to the Trinity College area. I would recommend the Alex to anyone visiting Dublin. We also stayed at the Merrion in 2021 and we both agreed that we liked the Alex better.",5,2023,12,22
215,"Comfortable, convenient and great customer service ","From check-in to check-out an amazing experience. The staff was lovely and the location was perfect. 10-15 min walk from most key locations but still very quiet.
The beds were super comfortable.
 had lunch at the Carriage restaurant- delightful surprise and very accommodating for food allergies. 

A shout out to Thiago for going above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and help us along the way till check-out. 
Would definitely return and a good value for the location, comfort and convenience.",5,2023,12,22
215,We loved Dublin!,"We loved Dublin and the staff at the hotel was great, especially Murilo who was wonderful, thoughtful and kind.  The city was lovely and amazing.

",4,2023,12,18
215,"Great design and staff, in the heart of city","Likely the best deal in town. Perfect location, great rooms, thoughtful amenities and great design. The GM is worth the visit alone, he went above and beyond to assist me and checked in on me throughout my stay. ",5,2023,12,13

215,Location and service at hotel is best,Had a great weekend away thanks to the Alex hotel.  The staff were super friendly and went out of the way to make our stay perfect.

215,Elegant and Classy. A lovely stay,"My partner and I stayed here for four nights in November. The Alex hotel is located in a quiet part of Dublin with a great pub store called the ginger man next door. The overall experience at the hotel was fantastic. The lobby was lovely and inviting, and the restaurant was food was tasty but on the higher side. 
The room was fantastic with the bed being heavenly and the bathroom facilities were comfortable and fairly modern.

Would recommend staying here!",5,2023,12,05
215,Our One night at the Alex Hotel,"Our first trip to Ireland and boy did we pick the perfect hotel for our one night in Dublin. We left the states late at night arrived early the next day and had trouble making our reservations for the storehouse at the Guinness factory.  The folks at the front desk could not have been more helpful! They set us up so that our group could go that day, The next morning we had our first Irish breakfast and again simply spectacular, the food options the service, the atmosphere, everything! Since we had limited time in Dublin, and had to go to Trinity College and see some sites again, Murilo at the front desk could not have been more accommodating. We were allowed to store our golf bags and suitcases in a safe, secure room so we hustled over to the college, the book of Kells and a museum. When we came back to get our luggage, I asked Murilo  for a card so that I could write this review. My wife, Cynthia, and I highly recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin. ",5,2023,12,02
215,Nails hit on the head,"An excellent and welcoming hotel that hits many nails on the head. 
The staff were friendly, and we found chocolates in our room with a birthday note- a lovely touch. 
The gym was absolutely brilliant- a highlight of our stay. The best equipped and quiet facility, and was thoroughly clean. 

The executive lounge was a fantastic touch- we had no issues with supply. They stock beer, wines, soft drinks, crisps, chocolate bars and a hot drinks machine. A great addition. 

House keeping was inconsistent:
- over the 3 nights we stayed we were never topped up with coffee pods for the machine
- were not topped up with biscuit 
- we‚Äôre not topped up with shower gel, conditioner or body lotion- despite being empty.

Restaurant: 
Service was extremely slow- we had to flag someone down to order drinks and food, and had to go up to the bar to ask for the bill. 
There was also a lack of atmosphere in the restaurant. 
The food was very tasty but let down by the service.

Overall an enjoyable stay, but would not eat here again.",5,2023,11,28
215,"Lovely, Comfortable hotel","This is a lovely hotel. The staff from the trainees on the desk and in the bar, to the more seasoned staff couldn't have been more helpful. The Classic King Bed Room was wonderful, nicely spacious. The bed was very comfortable. My wife isn't usually a fan of hotel breakfasts, but she was so impressed by the hotel breakfast, that we had one both mornings. They also introduced us to Teelings Whiskey which they had behind the bar, and which led us to visit the interesting distillery

Whilst it is located just five minutes away from the Airport bus stop, it is about 20 mins walk to the main centre of the City, but its a pleasant enough walk. ",4,2023,11,27
215,The Alex - A Warm Welcome,"Even though my stay was only overnight. I was made to feel welcome as soon as I came through the doors. I was met by Kristine's smile. The check-in and out was totally painless.

215,My go to place in Dublin,"Second stay at the Alex and was not disappointed.  I want to draw particular attention to Murilo and Caio who helped make my anniversary stay with family very special.  Hotel is clean and staff is attentive. Short walk to Temple bar area, Grafton street and Trinity College. This is my go to place in Dublin.",5,2023,11,23
215,Service was 10/10,"We arrived at The Alex for one night then left to stay at a castle in the countryside for 2 nights and headed back to The Alex for one more night before catching a flight back home. The staff let us keep our luggage in between our stays so that we only needed to travel with a day pack, which was really nice. When we got back they remembered us at the reception and when we arrived in our room they had a hand written note welcoming us back with some chocolates! Talk about service! The design of the hotel and the comfortable bed is just the cherry on top!",5,2023,11,23
215,Five days in Dublin,"Excellent Hotel, good service, quiet neighborhood very close to the Trinity College and the city center. A train station a few minutes walking. It is worth staying there whatever you go for leisure or business.",5,2023,11,22
215,Best steak I ate in Ireland,"The hotel and the room were beautiful, the restaurant's food was fantastic. Close to attractions. The only complaint is the lack of conditioner in the bathroom. Did not get to the gym but will mention that it is not in the same building.",5,2023,11,20

215,Celebrating Caoimhe's 21st at The Alex,We arrived at the Alex Hotel early and we were welcomed by Kyle who informed us that our room was ready. He also offered us a late check out next morning.

The breakfast was generous.",5,2023,10,31
215,Great hotel.,This is a gem of a hotel in a great location. Good staff service and overall a lovely experience.The breakfast was wonderful.

Nice mix of guests consisting of vacation and also business travelers..We were able to walk to almost everywhere we wanted to go.,5,2023,10,31
215,Brilliant hotel,"Amazing 2 night break with my husband, he was doing the Dublin marathon again and the location was perfect. Close to start/finish line, perfectly located for absorbing atmosphere. Room service was beautiful. We didn‚Äôt have breakfast as we had other plans but restaurant looked great. Parking close to hotel and service superb. ",5,2023,10,31
215,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,"I would love to stay in the Alex hotel again. Great location, friendly and helpful stuff, amazing rooms. Not sure what to mention as downsides, maybe high price, but for this price you get as high service level.",5,2023,10,30
215,Excellent hotel in ideal location,"Excellent hotel in a very central location. Staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. We were here on a very busy weekend during the Dublin City Marathon and at 7pm my adult son decided to stay with us. Murilo on reception was extremely helpful and even put the extra bed in the room himself as housekeeping staff had finished for the day. Also only an extra cost of ‚Ç¨40. Would highly recommend the hotel. Breakfast was also delicious with lots of choice of fresh, healthy food.",5,2023,10,30
215,"Eh, it was okay","Stayed here for two nights in October 2023. The rooms are fine, the place is nice. It's a little out of the way. About a 20 min walk from everything of interest. Not a lot of restaurants nearby. Front desk recommended a place called Kennedy's and it was bad. What this hotel does that I hate is the flat sheet instead of the fitted bottom sheet. Then they tuck in the comforter under the mattress. When you try to get in it all comes apart forcing me to make the bed again. Finally, stop with the comforter only bull. Give us a sheet, blanket and comforter. The comforter only option is too hot. When I take the comforter out of the covering, I need to call the front desk for a blanket and then the next day they put it all back together again.",2,2023,10,30
215,Excellent Hotel and Location,"The hotel was centrally located to many sites and an easy walking distance. The service was amazing, and we were spoiled by Helena as she made sure we had anything and everything. The breakfasts were delicious and plenty of choices.

Decor throughout hotel chic. ",5,2023,10,24
215,Up to date and great showers!,"The staff were very accommodating and friendly, the beds were 5 star comfort, the rooms have USB pulga by the bed, the showers felt like we were in a waterfall and fit my 6‚Äô7‚Äù husband with no issue! Location is a little out of the major crowds, but it was nice and quiet at night and the walk over to attractions is short and easy. The GingerMan next door has a great atmosphere and staff was awesome. Absolutely recommend staying at the Alex if you‚Äôre in Dublin. ",5,2023,10,24
215,The Alex - Great Hotel!,"We had a great stay at The Alex! The location is great and the rooms were beautiful. The hotel is very modern and very nicely decorated. The breakfast was excellent. I'd like to single out one staff member who impressed us, but I can't because they were all amazing. They offered help with restaurants, sites, and taxis. They responded to our every need and we felt very welcome there. As part of a tour planned by Irishtourism.com we stayed there at the front end and back end of of our Irish vacation. When we returned, we found a very nice welcome back note and treat in our room. The Alex was truly one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in.",5,2023,10,23
215,Great hotel,This was a very nice hotel with a decent location.  The staff was great and they went above and beyond to make you happy.  Our breakfasts were top notch. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  The only issue is that the parking is not on site.,5,2023,10,21
215,The Alex,"The Alex Hotel was very nice, clean, modern and full of friendly staff at every turn. Room was quiet, spacious and clean. Nicely appointed and had all the things we needed. Coffee machine was nice but a little confusing. The room attendants were great and handled a need for extra towels with kindness and grace. The staff in the dining area was very friendly and made our news for a room tray exquisite. Ali (I think is his name) went above and beyond making a tray for my wife. Desk staff offered places to eat and drink and were great scheduling a taxi to the airport on our departure day. Overall we had a great stay amd would definitely consider visiting again. There is so much to see in Dublin and three days is just not enough! 

Had a great visit!",5,2023,10,19

215,Great location,"We have been to Dublin many times and this was our favorite stay. To start the location is perfect, right in the center of things making most attractions walkable, but also just enough off to the side of the center for it to be quiet. The room itself was nice and clean, beds were very comfortable. The hotel was busy but rooms were quiet and we had no problem with fellow guests creating noise. Staff were helpful and welcoming. Didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel so cannot comment on quality of food. ",5,2023,10,16
215,"Jamie, a great member of the staff at The Alex in Dublin Ireland","This is a great hotel centrally located in the heart of Dublin.  It is accessible by foot to the wonderful Epic Museum, Trinity College, Grafton Street, and the Temple Bar neighborhood.  What makes this great hotel even more special is the friendly, helpful, and patient staff.  We were especially happy with Jamie.  He greeted us while we were waiting in line to check in; immediately offered to direct us to the parking garage a block away, and even drove with us to the garage so that we could understand the process.  He went above our expectations and put us at ease after a tiring day of driving.",5,2023,10,11

All in all an excellent hotel and I will return the next time I am in Dublin.  ",5,2023,10,02
215,Wonderful Spot in Dublin,"We had a wonderful stay at the Alex.

215,Well located very comfortable hotel,"Well located hotel, lovely room with very comfortable bed.  All meals we ate in the hotel were very good, particularly the plentiful breakfast buffet.  We also really enjoyed the outside seating area which was perfect for the hot days during our stay.  ",4,2023,09,12
215,Beautiful stylish hotel with great staff in perfect location,"Really solid hotel with comfortable rooms. Murilo and Nicolo were super helpful at the front desk. Staff was attentive and the location is excellent. The design has a luxurious mid-century modern feel, and everything seemed brand new. I would definitely stay again.",5,2023,09,11
215,Comfy Stay,"Our two night stay was comfortable‚Ä¶it was nice to have air conditioning since we visited during a heat wave, staff was helpful when we had an issue getting out of the parking garage and the breakfast options were nice!! ",4,2023,09,09
215,Great Stay!,We enjoyed this hotel and loved the breakfast. We were on our honeymoon and on our tour this was one of the nicest hotels we got to stay at. Very spacious and lovely shower! One plus we enjoyed was being able to log into streaming apps. ,5,2023,09,08
215,"Clean, stylish, excellent location.","Excellent hotel, friendly staff, stylish design and in an amazing location, walking distance from great shops, restaurants and tourist spots. Only downside was we heard quite a lot of door slamming/closing early in the morning and late at night, so the sound proofing could be better but otherwise a great stay, thank you üòä. ",5,2023,09,05
215,Amazing,Hotel was great  food was also fantastic restaurant manager Adi and restaurant staff Kenny were very friendly they paid attention to my very special diet needs.An overall very interesting stay I will definitely come back.,4,2023,09,04
215,"FANTASTIC HOTEL, WONDERFUL STAFF!","Everything exceeded expectations, from check in to check out. Alex Hotel is a modern upscale hotel, very conveniently located a short walk from all the tourist sites. The staff was incredibly gracious. The breakfast was perfect. Thank you for a lovely stay. Cannot recommend the Alex hotel enough. ",5,2023,09,03
215,Average hotel a 10 mins walk from central ,"1. Check in was fast but the receptionist didn't know I had breakfast included.
2. The room is good size and the bathroom too. The bathroom didn't have anything for u to hang towels and the ac was bad.
3. The worst part about the hotel the housekeeping. 2 consecutive days they didn't clean before 4 and the cleaning wasn't great. I stayed for 5 nights and there was no linen change.
4. The breakfast was good and the service was fantastic. The food was the same every day. 

I would recommend this hotel for a short stay only of a day or 2. The area is quiet. ",3,2023,08,31
215,Murilo,"Excellent hotel! The Alex hotel is a very nice centrally located place to stay in Dublin. All of the staff are very professional, polite, and courteous. They go out of their way to help you. One individual stands out and that is Murilo. He went out of his way to help us with different sites of the city to visit and gave us great advice. He is outstanding!",5,2023,08,30
215,Outstanding hotel in great Dublin location.,"We loved this hotel. Great location. Easy access to all the tourist destinations in Dublin. Very friendly staff, especially Murilo at the front desk. Housekeeping met all our needs. Breakfast was outstanding. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,08,30
215,"Nice rooms, helpful staff, food not so good",The rooms were very clean. The bathroom was modern. The staff were very nice and helpful. The breakfast food was bad - and I am not a picky eater. I was in Dublin to visit Trinity College on Business. The surrounding area was okay. ,4,2023,08,30
215,Fabulous,The service at The Alex was fantastic! The entire team was wonderful. Matthew was particularly awesome and engaging! We felt very much at home from start to finish. The food and drinks were high quality. The entire property was clean and well cared for too.,5,2023,08,28
215,Great Hotel,Stayed four nights here and was impressed with the staff and facilities. The fitness center was at an adjacent hotel but was very nice. Breakfast was great here too. On departure the chef even served us 30 minutes earlier than normal hours so we could get to eat. Very nice!,5,2023,08,28
215,The Best of Dublin,"We spent 2 weeks at The Alex for an event, working from the hotel, eating at the hotel and sleeping in their beautiful rooms. Every second was special. The staff were extraordinary.

Shout out to Stephen from Food and Beverage and Sandra at the restaurant for taking pity on me my 1st day and welcomed me with a warm cup of coffee and a smile.

I won't stay anywhere else if I go back again.

",5,2023,08,28
215,Excellent Hotel. Great Staff,"            We recently stayed at the Alex Hotel again. It is an excellent hotel. Our room was comfortable, fairly large and quiet. The location, near the National Museums and the Pearse train station, is another benefit.
            Then there is the staff. They are helpful, friendly and made our stay more enjoyable. 
            This was especially true of Murilo (hope I got his name right, but he is hard to miss ‚Äì he is very tall) who was a real help. The front desk and the breakfast staff (friendly people in the morning is real plus) were also great.
           The Wi-Fi in our room was very good. The TV had a broad selection of channels. And the room was well maintained
            As no hotel is perfect here is the only minor issue we had. It was all the electric switches. Whoever designed the system made  it complicated. The master switches not only turn off and on which lights, but, also in our room, one of the electric outlets. Problem was solved, with Murilo‚Äôs help, by plugging a lamp in another outlet using one of the adapters we had.
            When we return to Dublin we will be sure to stay at the Alex.
",5,2023,08,23
215,Very nice hotel in great location,Great location near the center and shopping. Lots of pubs near by. Short distance to river. Amazing gym located in their sister hotel close by. Big updated room.  Twin beds. Walls are a little thin. Could hear the neighbors. Great coffee and tea options. Very nice towels. Front desk staff wee super nice. Would stay here again.,5,2023,08,22
215,"Awesome Rooms, Great Location","Awesome rooms, great location. Cool modern vibe in a very walkable Dublin area. During our Ireland trip we wanted to do one upscale night in Dublin and chose the Alex because our family was in the sister Mont hotel, but it was sold out. We both thought very highly of our hotels. We were there on the day of a big rugby match and the bar next door was a little noisy with people outside, but it quieted down completely before midnight. There may be a curfew it got quiet so quickly. But if you are a weary traveler and need an early bedtime, you may ask for a room away from that bar. ",5,2023,08,21
215,Great Dublin Hotel,"Excellent staff and accommodations. Nicely laid out rooms. Nice bar and eating facilities in the hotel. Perfect location. Slightly off the beaten path, but close enough to walk to everything. Would totally recommend staying here.",5,2023,08,18
215,BEAUTIFUL SECRET GARDEN WITH EXCELLENT VEGAN OPTIONS ,"My husband and I had lunch in the beautiful Secret Garden last Friday. They have fabulous vegan options so it was lovely to have a few choices to ponder over. We decided on the vegan wrap and salad and shared same. This was a great decision as the wrap was huge, very flavoursome with vegetables and vegan cheese and the salad was gorgeous with a lovely curried cauliflower topping over leaves and veg. We washed same down with a glass of red. We were too full for dessert but will try next time as thru also offer a vegan option. The garden us beautiful and staff were so nice and helpful. This is a real little oasis in the middle of the city with excellent vegan options. We will be back ",5,2023,08,14
215,Amazing Hotel,"Cannot recommend this hotel enough, they really take care of you and it is absolutely stunning! Me and my partner enjoyed every minute of it. The staff were super helpful with our check in and check out and also helped us change bookings for some tours we had booked with third party websites. ",5,2023,08,13
215,Well Worth It!,"Lovely hotel, delicious morning buffet, amazing location, but best of all are the people that work there who are friendly, helpful and will do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. Murilo was especially helpful at check in who did everything from unloading the car, checking us in, parking the car (including a quick lesson on driving an electric car :) bringing our luggage upstairs and offering dinner suggestions.  Each and every staff member we encountered on our stay was just as friendly and helpful. Highly recommend The Alex Hotel.",5,2023,08,11
215,Best nights sleep ever!,"We decided to come to Dublin for a last minute trip, we wanted a nice hotel walking distance to the centre. It was out of our price range but definitely worth the quality of the hotel. 
The bed was glorious, and they even give options for different kinds of pillows you‚Äôd prefer. Ours were perfect! 
Loved the fridge in the room, definitely nice when it‚Äôs a hot day we did buy some of our own drinks to enjoy. 
The tv also, using media we were able to connect to Netflix on our phones to have more options of films to watch. 

Staff were lovely and very welcoming. 

Very nice local restaurants, bars and cafes. 

Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt eat/drink here just due to out of our price range. 

",5,2023,08,11
215,Terrible pillows,"Breakfast was not given, they said that we do not have breakfast.  But we clarified with the people who reserved the room that breakfast was supposed to be included.There are pillows in the room, on which it is impossible to sleep. We put them aside and slept without pillows at all.",3,2023,08,10
215,The Alex - a great hotel in the heart of Dublin ,"The Alex - described as a boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin - lived up to all of the positive reviews we read before our trip. The staff - especially Johnny and Jessica at the front desk - helped us with all of our travel and logistics questions and always had a perfect solution. 
 We stayed here on our arrival in Ireland for four nights and then returned for the last night before we flew home. Wonderful breakfast service, with a dining room managed magnificently by the amazing Abdul. A wide assortment of hot and cold dished including full Irish breakfast and huge assortment of Irish breads. 
The location is perfect - walking distance to Trinity College and Grafton Street and other top sights. Guests are also to use the gym as a sister hotel across the street, which my sons greatly appreciated. 
The hotel has won awards for being eco-conscious and has energy saving features like lights that only turn on when you are in the room, with your key card inserted in a slot. impressive. 
Comfortable beds - overall a perfect place for our time in Dublin. We definitely would stay here again. ",5,2023,08,06
215,Great location and nice hotel but be prepared for hot rooms,"This is a very nice hotel in an excellent location within easy walking distance of historic downtown Dublin.  The restaurant there is excellent. Not only do they serve a great breakfast, but dinners there are first rate as well.  Beds were comfortable, service was first rate. Everything about this hotel was 4+ star except for one thing, and for that I took off 1 star. The AC in the rooms is just awful.  We stayed in two different rooms, one for 2 nights and one for 1 night.  Fortunately for us the temperature outside when we stayed was in the high 50-60F range.  Otherwise, we would have cooked in the room. We tried opening the window, but As it was, the one window in the room was so small it couldn't let in any air.  And when the window was open, the AC turned off (which I understand).  I would only recommend this hotel for cooler temperature stays. Otherwise, be prepared to be uncomfortable warm.",3,2023,08,02
215,First time stay but excellent experience and will be back,"Our experience as a family at this hotel was excellent. Nice accommodations with clean, well kept and contemporary rooms. High quality furnishings and nice amenities. Great location close enough to the center of Dublin yet just on the perimeter so that traffic and city noise is not an issue. ",5,2023,08,01
215,Super cute deco escape!,"Super cute, tidy, deco and comfortable. Staff is extremely helpful and available. Rooms are precisely what you need in Dublin - quiet and with awesome comfy beds. Very charming. Close enough to be within walking distance from everything you want to see but far enough to allow you to exhale from the hustle and bustle. Our new fave stay in Dublin. We‚Äôll! be back!",5,2023,07,30
215,Lovely staff in reception ,"Nice and comfortable hotel. The service in the restaurant was not what I expected but reception made our experience enjoyable. Thanks to Karen and Murilo. 
Murilo, friendly and professional, made sure everything was perfect for us.",4,2023,07,30
215,Best hotel in Dublin,"I have only three letters for The Alex Hotel and that's WOW! The experience begins when the automatic doors open to the lobby because you will smell a lovely scent in the air that made me take a few extra breaths. The same happened when we opened our door to the room. We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and I can tell you this is the best hotel that we have visited in the whole world. Beautiful room, amazing bed and pillows, delicious breakfast and professional and friendly staff. This hotel deserve 5 stars.",5,2023,07,29
215,Dublin trip,The service was terrible. The parking was a nightmare. No one seem to want to help this. Very very disappointing would never stay there again there are plenty of hotels in Dublin and I‚Äôm sure you can find more.,2,2023,07,25
215,Comfortable room in an excellent location,"A friend and I just had a lovely stay at The Alex, which we booked because of the excellent location and we'd absolutely stay here again. The staff was extremely professional and helpful, the late night room service was delicious, and our room was very well appointed. The only downsides were my friend has a down allergy and getting feather free pillows and blankets took a bit of searching for the hotel so I would recommend making that request in your reservation and confirming the day before you arrive. And while our room was very large the bathroom was rather small so if you need ample counter space for makeup or doing your hair this probably isn't the best set up. ",4,2023,07,24
215,Excellent hotel and service!,"The Alex Hotel was perfect for our family vacation. We stayed for a week in total and were very comfortable. The staff went above and beyond - Murillo found us a wheelchair when we needed one, and Anais helped us very graciously when we realized we had forgotten to book our final night. The location was ideal as well - walking distance from attractions, but slightly removed from the busy neighborhood. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a hip, clean, easygoing boutique hotel in Dublin!",5,2023,07,22
215,2 nights,"Everything was realy good! Thank you. Very clean, great service, beautifull room with so causy bed. Hair dryer and ironing maschine in room. Very good! Bathroom was also modern designed with nice shower. Very clean and modern. Good curtons on the windows. Great location in the city.",5,2023,07,22
215,Wonderful stay,"We truly enjoyed our stay at The Alex. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Our plane arrived at 5:30am on Friday and we got to the Hotel by 9am. They stored our luggage for us so we could walk around, grab breakfast and see the city before check-in. The luggage process was super easy and efficient and the staff took great care of all our things. ",5,2023,07,18
215,High on design but poor functionality,"The Alex has a sleek, modern design.. too bad they forgot about functionality.  The AC had such a low output as to be ineffective at actually cooling the room. Had a poor night's sleep. The telephone didn't work and the bathroom, while again having a nice design, had no towel rails or hooks - so where exactly are we supposed to hang our towels?  Room service took 30 minutes and 2 phone calls to get a pot of tea and they slapped a 10 euro tray fee for that - ridiculous! Good location though and the reception staff were competent. ",3,2023,07,12
215,Modern hotel with great location,"Great location for a stay in Dublin.  Hotel is modern, spotlessly clean, rooms are large, beds are comfy but a few complaints.  No robes in rooms, WiFi is TERRIBLE and the STEAM coffee shop is not open on weekends. Also the breakfast restaurant does NOT offer a quick continental breakfast option (coffee/pastry) for guests that don't opt for the full buffet breakfast. ",4,2023,07,11
215,Great stay,Had an excellent stay at The Alex.  Hotel was very clean and staff very friendly.  Breakfast was delicious! The executive lounge was a nice perk.  The location was very convenient.  Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2023,07,11
215,Trying to be a 4 star,Location is perfect for walking in to the city.  Hotel nice enough but fell short of a 4 star. No bathrobes in rooms.  The bar closes at 10.30pm and couldn‚Äôt do an Irish coffee as the machine had been cleaned. They also didn‚Äôt know what a Buck‚Äôs Fizz was!,3,2023,07,05
215,"Great stay, friendly staff, tasty breakfast spread","The room was lovely. We had nice conversations with, and felt well taken care of by the friendly staff, and the breakfast spread and atmosphere in the restaurant was a great way to start our busy days. 

Will definitely stay again! ",5,2023,07,05
215,Terrific central Dublin hotel,This is a really lovely hotel in a great central location with friendly and helpful staff. The bed was so comfortable. Very clean all throughout and housekeeping (Helena) was extremely nice. I‚Äôd highly recommend a stay. ,5,2023,07,02
215,Wonderful accommodations with a friendly & helpful staff!,"Everything about our stay was wonderful! The staff were so nice & accommodating. The facility was beautiful, clean and comfortable. It was waking distance to several fun pubs/restaurants. We would recommend The Alex in Dublin!!",5,2023,06,30
215,Worth a Stay!,"Our experience at the Alex was wonderful! The staff, food, drinks, hotel design, and location were perfect. The only negative was the air conditioning which did not work well in the rooms. The lobby and restaurant were nice and cool, but we could never get our room to be a comfortable temperature. We did ask the staff about this issue. 

We would stay again during a cooler time of year, and we DO recommend The Alex! ",4,2023,06,27
215,Lovely reception staff and really comfortable rooms,Lovely quiet rooms with v comfy beds. You can Chromecast Netflix or other apps very easily. Nice bathroom. The reception staff were very kind and helpful. Close to museums and shopping but in a quiet area.,5,2023,06,25
215,Only ok not value for money,"This is a really expensive hotel but nothing about it matches the price.

DO NOT bother we executive lounge. It‚Äôs tiny with a few drinks in bay rarely replenished.

Executive room not much bigger than standard.  

Came back to our room late not even serviced. At these prices we were shocked.

Dublin I don‚Äôt think has a lot of higher end options but I would not come back to this one based on our experience.

215,Short trip to Dublin,Lovely hotel. Very comfortable with great staff. Big shout out to Caner and Jason who helped us with a blocked sink when one of us had been poorly. Couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful or considerate. All of the hotel is very clean and fresh. Rooms and beds very good,5,2023,06,22
215,Felt like family,Zoe-Marie was amazing.  Airline lost our bags. I had beer spilled on me. Zoe & other staff helped me have the hygiene essentials & washed my clothes after hrs & brought them to us early so we could continue our trip & feel like family. All staff were very friendly and amazing. We will definitely be coming back to the Alex. If you want to post this that‚Äôs totally fine. Thank you management!,5,2023,06,20
215,Great food,"Food is superb! We had lunch for four and both food and service was excellent. Very good value for money too. We are here for a three day tech conference and every step of the way we have found the hotel to be flawless, very thorough and attentive.",5,2023,06,20
215,The Staff at the Alex is top-notch,"The Staff was excellent, especially the front desk group of Murillo, Maria Eliza and Johnny.  Our large family group was bumped from The Green Hotel because of water damage and descended on the Alex very tired and grumpy after a 10 hour flight from LA.  The front desk did an excellent job of getting us into our rooms.  In addition, We had three generations of family with us, and lots of special requests (like a bottle of warm milk at 4:30 AM). We would like to thank the entire desk staff and especially the three  mentioned above. Great job; thanks to them we had a wonderful stay.",5,2023,06,19
215,"Great location, great hotel","This was our first time there.  The location is great, walkable to just about everywhere.  Great pubs right there.

The beds were very comfortable, after a long day of touring, it was awesome to lie down and get a good night's sleep.

We'll stay there again!",5,2023,06,19
215,Just a really great hotel,"Super nice hotel, great decor, the rooms are really nice and stylish. The staff is also extremely friendly and accommodating. The breakfast selection is among the best i have ever seen at a hotel. Can highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2023,06,15
215,The Best Hotel üëå,"This is the friendliest hotel we have ever experienced.  From Jason, the manager, the reception, dining room, and housekeeping staff, they just went over and beyond! 
The bed was so comfy, the room was very clean and the breakfast every morning was delicious.
We feel like we've made new friends there, and we look forward to returning again soon.
We highly recommend this hotel üëå",5,2023,06,14
215,My Family Trip to Dublin,"I can‚Äôt say enough nice things about the staff, from the front desk to the restaurant we met some wonderful people.  The beds were so comfortable especially after a long day of touring the city.  Breakfast was delicious, and served early and long enough for all of us to eat before starting our day. ",5,2023,06,13
215,Great Hotel But ,"I loved this hotel , staff were wonderful, warm & friendly especially Jason who was a true gentleman with a personality to go with it. 

Rooms were great , spacious and comfortable , bed was one of the best I've slept in anywhere. Wonderful breakfast with a great well cooked array of food.

So why am I only giving the hotel a 3 star rating,  Because it does not accept cash anywhere on the premises , card only.  We were in a group that had elderly people and teenagers , they only had cash .....teenagers had to come and ask me to pay for coffees they ordered because they don't have cards, it was embarrassing for them especially as they were trying to impress the young lady they asked in for a coffee.   Is it legal to refuse cash?",3,2023,06,12
215,Good value for money hotel,"The hotel is located in the center, allowing you to go by walk to any POI of the city.
No Valet parking, no help to take care of the luggages when I arrived.
The rooms are modern.
the breakfast is served on the ground floor.
",4,2023,06,12
215,Great stay in Dublin! ,"The Alex is a wonderful hotel. Great location for touring Dublin, attentive staff and comfortable rooms. Breakfast was very nice as well.   A special thank you to Angela and Murilo for assisting with our luggage snafu!  Highly recommend. ",5,2023,06,09
215,Lovely stay,Lovely hotel really friendly staff would very much recommend.  Excellent service close to city centre and all of the amenities.  Great gym located in the hotel next door.  We booked the executive room which came with complementary drinks which was well worth it.,5,2023,06,05
215,"Rude, unhelpful staff","Staff shows alarming lack of empathy or care for your individual situation. Beware: 4pm check-in time may be utterly non-negotiable (for some guests, apparently not all). Preferential treatment seems to be given to tour groups over individual travelers.",2,2023,06,04
215,Gorgeous design and spacious suite! The attention to detail in the space layout and the decorative items were perfect.,We were very pleasantly surprised at how spacious and beautiful our suite was when we walked in! We felt that every detail for design and function were addressed. We could not have been happier! Thanks to the staff too! ,5,2023,06,03
215,One night stay,"Good hotel, with comfortable rooms. Issues that did arise were dealt with swiftly with a change of room due to noise. The welcome pack of food was a nice touch (there was a lot of food and we ended up cancelling our dinner reservation). We didn't have a breakfast as we needed to check out early to get to the ferry terminal. Would stay again. ",4,2023,06,02
215,Excellent hotel,The Alex is a wonderful hotel. The manager and staff all are friendly and accommodating! The amenities are great and the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting Dublin pubs and sites easily! Definitely will stay there again!,5,2023,06,02
215,Wonderful spot in Dublin,"Centrally located, The Alex is a wonderful hotel in walking distance from most of Dublin's primary attractions, and certainly an easy Uber to any too far to walk.  Despite being downtown our room was quiet and cozy.  The decor is immaculate and cleanliness is clearly a priority.  The rooms themselves are spacious, cool (proper AC!), and beautifully appointed with a very modern throw-back appeal ... kinda like you're in an awesome Wes Anderson film in Ireland. 
 There's also a very good coffee shop in the lobby.  Overall A+ and would return.",5,2023,06,01
215,Excellence at the Alex,"Jason and his staff provided extraordinary service and attention to all of our needs.
We traveled in Ireland for 2 weeks with stays at two 5 star castles. Jason and his staff stood out and provided for us and exceeded all expectations. We would gladly return and recommend The Alex to all family and friends.
",5,2023,06,01
215,Great breakfast,"Comfortable hotel in good location for weekend break.  The rooms were lovely and clean with nice bathroom. Great breakfast, although some of the staff in the restaurant could have been more pleasant.  Helpful staff on reception.
We would stay here again.",5,2023,05,31
215,"Great location, poor services","The location is fantastic, the gym is in another hotel around the corner, the executive lounge is not worth the extra money (coffee machine unusable one day, cappuccino function broken all week, lounge was not replenished more than once during our week stay) housekeeping did not replenish items in the room, the A/C was not very good in the unusual hot weather. The bed was comfortable, water pressure was very low. A solid 3 star hotel experience.",3,2023,05,31
215,Cute and quiet hotel centrally located,"The decor at the Alex hotel is very cute and modern and it is in a quiet location closely located to the city center. It was clean and cozy but the rooms were lacking a bit. It seems like they spent all their money on the decor for the lobby and none for the room. That wouldn‚Äôt stop me from staying there again but I just thought it was weird there was no dresser. Either way, a cute and comfy place. ",3,2023,05,31
215,"Perfect hotel, perfect location","Our first trip to Dublin.  Booked this hotel based on reviews/location.  Many hotels in the tourist areas are close to noisy streets.  This one, 10 mins walk to all tourist spots, without the noise.  Highly recommend for families, traveling with friends or solo.",5,2023,05,29
215,Dublin may 2023,"Excellent location. Design of the room is fine. Cleanliness is very bad. Breakfast food is good. Dinner food has to be improuved. Service friendly but not pro. 
Coffee shop opens only week time and closed at 4 pm.",4,2023,05,29
215,"Great location, friendly staff","Nice place, quiet and close to all the sights and the tube. Maria at the front desk was awesome. Room was a bit warm, air conditioning didn‚Äôt work well as it was hot when we were there. The food was great and loved the secret garden area in the back.  ",4,2023,05,29
215,"Modern, clean, quiet and central hotel and good value for the price. Highly recommended","Great location: 15 min walk to most places tourists would want to visit and also convenient for excellent restaurants and businesses. 
The hotel is newly renovated, clean, quiet and has comfortable, reasonably spacious rooms. The restaurant has solid food options and the staff were friendly and willing to accommodate some requests for alternative options. 
To be candid, I had a series of frustrating experiences with parking. The current solution really doesn‚Äôt work. I am not deducting a star because the manager, Jason Ormston, was a star in fixing the problem each time. 
Overall, good value for the money and I will go back",5,2023,05,29
215,Anniversary trip,"Not sure my experience was typical of others, however, here a few points concerning our stay.
1. Check did not go smoothly as we did not receive all the necessary room information, and the breakfast days were not recorded properly.
2. The bedroom layout did not match the website for the Junior suite. There was virtually no room between the bed and the bathroom to walk from on on side of the bed.
3. The drinking glasses in the bedroom were dirty and two consecutive days, for which I had to complain the manager with pictures and the dirty glasses. Makes you wonder what else is not being cleaned to expectations.
4. The executive lounge closes at 17:00 and could not find any bottle openers
5. The functional design layout of the shower was terrible in the Junior Suite we had. It had a rain head and hand-held unit, but the darkness and layout made it's use less than ideal.
6. For an alleged 4-star hotel and price, I do not think the hotel delivered on it's promises. ",2,2023,05,25
215,Awesome Staff!,"The front desk staff and restaurant staff were friendly and attentive! They were able to accommodate early check in and made us feel welcome throughout our stay.  We had breakfast included, but an early morning flight, so the restaurant staff went above and beyond and provided us with a take-out solution that was delicious. 
 ",5,2023,05,16
215,This is a first rate hotel in a convenient lication.,"We received first rate treatment from everyone at the hotel. Jason, the manager and all of the staff met all of our needs. The rooms were roomy and well cared for.  We recommend that you take the package which includes breakfast. There were options for every taste. There were always fresh fruit cups, a variety of pastries, cereals, yogurt , eggs, bacon and black or white pudding for the adventurous.",5,2023,05,16
215,Full Service Hotel,"We had a Classic King Room, which was very spacious and comfortable. The hotel has excellent amenities and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Very easy and smooth check-in and out process. Good location too - not a far walk to lots of different places in Dublin. ",5,2023,05,16
215,The Alexüëçüëè‚ù§Ô∏è,"We had such a wonderful trip to Ireland.  Staying in Dublin at ther Alex was a treat,  we loved everything about our stay.  The Alex was great proximity to many of the Dublin great attractions; St Stephen‚Äôs Green, Trinity College, Historical tours & many more.
All of the Staff were helpful and enjoyable to chat with.  Anais & the front desk were welcoming.  All the restaurant employees were bright and friendly as we went every morning to our breakfast.  Rebecca & Angela & the friendly gent (can‚Äôt remember his name) greeted us along with the rest of the am crew with a smile and ‚Äúcoffee or tea‚Äù ?
The Alex was one  of our best choices in places to stay in Dublin.
Thank you Jason Ormston and everyone at the Alex that made this trip so enjoyable.  We would recommend your hotel to anyoneüëç",5,2023,05,15
215,Impressive,"Loved location and great friendly staff!  Sleep was wonderful, quiet and comfy.  Ate at restaurant, delicious a pleasant staff.  The rooms are inviting, nice size with comfort.  I would definitely stay here again if I ever have opportunity to return to Dublin.",5,2023,05,14
215,Terrific hotel in the heart of Dublin,"A modern hotel located near Trinity College -- easy walking distance to many wonderful  museums, restaurants and theatres.  Cordial and fun front desk staff (Murilo!) were quick to help with directions, arranging taxis, umbrellas and even bags of ice for sore backs after transatlantic flights.  Room staff super helpful as well.",5,2023,05,13
215,"Perfection, felt like family  and just a huge THANK YOU! ","We started and ended our 2 week trip in Dublin at The Alex! We felt like we were family from the moment we arrived to when we had to leave.. the staff were beyond amazing Jason Orwstou helped our group out with a huge smile and utmost willingness! Fleur could NOT be more sweet, helpful and just so
Kind! We highly recommend this beautiful most comfortable and fabulously located hotel! Every thing about it is 5 star! Thank you hope we will see you again! Joni and Dennis Carlson Bend Oregon USA",5,2023,05,08
215,Awesome stay!,"The hotel is beautiful with an amazing cafe, great service and location. The staff including Emma dnd Jason went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. I wish I could bring that level of service back to the states. The beds and pillows are super comfortable. The gym at their sister property, the Mont, has everything including kettle bells, TRX, smash balls, free weights and equipment- full service gym!!! I love that you can crack the windows for fresh air.  Will definitely come back. ",5,2023,05,08
215,Stay here!,"Centrally located, the Alex is within easy walking distance to many attractions, saving us a lot of taxi fares The hotel is clean and quiet. Very little street noise could be heard in our room. Staff is helpful, knowledgeable and kind. Anais was wonderfully helpful at the front desk. Jason, the new, young manager keeps his pulse on the hotel's activity, lending a hand wherever needed. He asked our travel party if there was anything we could think of to improve our stay, but we couldn‚Äôt think of much!

The rooms are quiet and of adequate size with nice bed linens. The hotel has a full-service restaurant and bar. But with two good pubs serving food as well as two Italian restaurants very close by, we grabbed dinner and a pint at one of these most evenings. We booked a package that included brekkie (breakfast) and enjoyed a huge assortment of foods every morning. Some food items were new to us and quite enjoyable. This hearty and convenient breakfast was a great way to start the day. The cafe breakfast service was impeccable, especially server Rebecca. I would strongly recommend travelers choose the brekkie item when booking their stay.

Tip: ask for an extra top sheet to act as a light blanket. The comforters are quite warm and, as we noticed in all of Ireland, they like to keep rooms toasty.
",5,2023,05,06
215,SECOND HOME,"My husband and I stayed with two other couples at The Alex  from April 24  until May 4, 2023. The entire  staff and especially the manager, Jason, made our stay simply wonderful.  The rooms were spotless, the morning breakfasts were tasty and efficient, and the front desk and restaurant personnel were warm and very helpful.  Very quickly we felt we had found our second  home in Dublin. For example: My birthday occurred on one of our last days at The Alex.  I was greeted with happy birthday wishes from everyone, and I also discovered some yummy chocolate candies and a delightful candle in my room. 

Our every need was quickly taken care of, if not anticipated. The location was great.  I highly recommend a stay at The Alex if you are planning a trip to Dublin.

215,Lovely room + Awesome meals,"We had a great stay at The Alex as we ended our vacation in Ireland. It's a good location, walkable to key attractions but not in a noisy area. The room was lovely - comfortable bed and nice, hot shower. Definitely get the breakfast. It's a buffet with everything you could want. And dinner in the Secret Garden was awesome. Wonderful food and outstanding service from Grainne! Highly recommend!",5,2023,05,03
215,Beautiful Hotel and Incredible Service,"We couldn‚Äôt have been happier with our stay here. The rooms were large, comfortable and beautifully furnished. The hotel staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Jason and Patrick, in particular, made our stay special by sending a bottle of wine to our room for our wedding anniversary. 

We also dined in both the hotel‚Äôs restaurant and in its morning cafe. Both were fantastic.

The location of the hotel is a 10-15 min walk from almost anything you could want to do in Dublin, so we rarely took a taxi. 

If you are planning on staying in Dublin, I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2023,05,03
215,"Excellent Hotel, exceptional staff","The Alex in Dublin is a wonderful travel experience.  We* were warmly welcomed on our arrival by their very professional staff, our rooms were comfortable, clean and we had everything we needed for a restful stay.  The breakfasts offered high quality food, the dining staff was very helpful.    The location is excellent; for example,  we easily walked to see the Book of Kells exhibit, St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, the Temple Bar, good restaurants. Despite its proximity to all of these resources, the Alex is on a quiet street, very little urban street sounds in the area.  What made our stay especially wonderful was the Hotel's professional staff:  Jason checked with us each day to make sure we had all we needed, Anais provided extra assistance in making sure our room's heater was working properly, Patrick went out of his way to locate tickets for us at the Book of Kells tour.  We thank them, we had such good customer service.  We will definitely stay at The Alex on future trips to Dublin and highly recommend this hotel to family and friends.  

*My husband and I and our adult son",5,2023,04,28
215,Near Excellence,"Everything that really matters was spot-on.  Cleanliness, comfort, service, etc.  The only negative was that they did not provide facial cloths, even on request. Every other hotel during our trip had them when we asked. ",5,2023,04,27
215,Good location,"A nice hotel with friendly staff. We upgraded to an executive room which was large and had a huge extremely comfortable bed. 
The hotel is well positioned to all areas of Dublin with a pub serving food next door, Kilkenny‚Äôs store 5 mins away- it serves excellent breakfasts with all special diets catered - a hidden gem.
Loads of great restaurants off Grafton street which can be booked ahead.

Only criticisms our room wasn‚Äôt made up until after 4.00pm on Saturday with no tea/coffee included but supplied on request.
The bathroom is small, especially the shower which isn‚Äôt powerful but adequate.

Overall a good stay but we didn‚Äôt include breakfast. At 25euros per person it seemed steep when we bought two excellent breakfasts at Kilkennys for less than 20 euros.",4,2023,04,26
215,My Stay,Overall was Good. Wonderful experience. Service was good. Food quality was maintained throughout my stay though it was the same variety of food served.  Employees were exceptionally friendly and kind. It was a good experience. Thank you.,5,2023,04,25
215,10/10 Fantastic,"Great location, great staff, great room, good price. Front desk staff was very accommodating when we asked to extend our stay by one day due to a missed flight. They let us stay in the same room and didn't upcharge our rate (as far as I could remember). Couldn't recommend more. ",5,2023,04,18
215,Dublin hotel,"What a nice hotel. Great location. Easy access to so many restaurants and pubs. Rooms very comfortable. The breakfast buffet had everything you‚Äôd want.   The staff was so helpful, especially Patrick at the front desk. He went above and beyond on several occasions to help us. Very knowledgeable about the area. Always available to answer any and all of our questions.  Wish we had someone like him at every hotel we visit. ",5,2023,04,16
215,Business hotel,"From the warm welcome you receive when you arrive at The Alex, to all the waiting staff in the restaurant who tended to all our needs. The bedrooms are spacious and nothing was too much trouble. The pub next door was also very good.",5,2023,04,13
215,Would stay here again!,"We enjoyed our stay and only wish we could have stayed longer. They put on a great breakfast that we afforded ourselves of. The staff was incredibly helpful and always available. I should point out that there is no on site parking, so if you have a car you will need to park about 3 minutes away. That said we never needed a car and either walked, taxi'd or Uber'd everywhere. Thank you!",5,2023,04,11
215,Wonderful stay,"It was a wonderful trip for along weekend. The hotel is perfectly central for all important sightseeing things. Breakfast is good but you habe to be there early to get the full  choice.
EverBody working in TheAlex is very obliging and nice.",4,2023,04,11
215,"Phenomenal customer service, incredible location, amazing bed and shower","We had an absolutely AMAZING stay here! PERFECT location and INCREDIBLE staff. Patrick and Treema at the front desk went above and beyond to assist us with our upcoming itinerary after leaving Dublin. We needed to figure out how to get to Ashford castle and modify our stay in Galway. Patrick took care of everything! He called the hotels and gave us various options for getting to Ashford castle. I've never had such incredible service by a concierge. Treema assisted us with booking another night stay and when I chose the wrong date she swiftly corrected it. Due to the incredible customer service we received we booked an extra night before our flight out of Dublin. Aside from the 5 star service, the beds are AMAZING!!!! SOOOOOO comfortable!!! LOVE the waterfall shower as well! And the location is absolutely perfect. Easy walk to temple bar and shops yet on a quiet, quaint street. Kennedy bar is right across the street - fantastic food and music just a few steps from the hotel!!! The Alex hotel really made our Dublin stay as incredible as could be!!! Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2023,04,10
215,Wonderful to meet Jason,"The Alex is a Fantastic hotel and I give my highest recommendation to anybody considering staying with them. I traveled with my wife, her parents, and her brothers + sis-in-law. 

Everything from front desk, to lobby decor, to hotel room was perfect. Our rooms were comfortable and clean. The location was close to the action but far enough to be quiet.

All things aside, the best experience we had at The Alex was meeting a manager or concierge named Jason. He struck up a conversation with us as we were sitting at the lobby and checking out. He made us feel genuinely welcome at the hotel and Ireland as a whole. He congratulated my parents-in-law on their 40th anniversary and even brought down a beautiful soy candle as a thoughtful, parting gift. His overall vibe was just so warm and friendly and it felt like the ultimate extension of the hospitality and friendliness we felt while traveling throughout Ireland. I'm glad we stayed at the Alex before heading home.",5,2023,04,09
215,Friendly Service and Comfortable Rooms,"From our (very) early check-in experience to our slightly late check-out the staff were all incredibly welcoming and accommodating.  Patrick at the front desk allowed us to check in many hours early and put us in a room right away!  This was a wonderful surprise after our long flight and began our vacation in the best way possible.  The bed was terrific and everything was tidy.  A treat was even left in our room to celebrate this being our honeymoon! 
This was very thoughtful and we appreciated it!  We will definitely come back and highly recommend The Alex.",5,2023,04,09
215,Great location and the Staff went above & beyond!,This hotel is in a great location - walkable to all the best Dublin sites. Also but a very popular pub & off a main road so it was very quiet.  Breakfast buffett had lots of offerings. The dinner was so delicious!  ,5,2023,04,09
215,Excellent,"The Alex hotel is wonderful. Very clean, smells great and fantastic staff. I recommend purchasing the breakfast (at least some of your stay) . It is excellent. 
I bit of a walk to the Temple area. Probably about .8 of a mile. 
Off site parking was great.  Just takes a bit to navigate how to actually get in the garage. 
I would definitely stay at the Alex again
",5,2023,04,06
215,"The Alex Hotel: Welcoming, warm, and elegant!","Lovely note in a perfect, quiet spot near lots of sites and restaurants. The hotel strikes a perfect balance between elegance and comfort. Staff is incredibly friendly. Beds are comfortable and bedding is luscious and clean with Irish-made merino wool throws on top of duvets. 

Restaurant food is excellent. Shout out to my wait-staff this evening -- Rocio and Vania -- who gave me great service!",5,2023,04,04
215,The Alex - Great Accommodations all around,"Great hotel in wonderful location.  Rooms were excellent, very clean and the staff kept up with towels and cleaning.  The hotel had an excellent breakfast, great bar and two dining areas.  All of the staff was kind and courteous and helpful. Believe me we put them to the test with two grandchildren ages 2 & almost 4.  They made us always feel welcomed.",5,2023,04,02
215,How Many Euros are you Worth?,"The hotel is smaller. The breakfast is very good. Breakfast Kitchen Staff and Serving staff were well trained and welcoming. 

The front desk and reservations are quirky and uncomfortable best word to describe it is unyielding. (you know, when they interrupt you because they just know what your going to say?) 

- The Alex benefitted from a $500 dollar error with no recognition or consideration, it really smarts!

The room was fine, it was quite warm with no way to cool it down, the need to at least offer some fans or something. 

There are some positives. Once they have you in the hotel and have your credit card run, they tend to treat you nicely.",3,2023,04,01
215,Great first stop on our Ireland vacation.,"Our first stop in Dublin. Took an overnight flight into Dublin. Arrived at the Alex before our room was ready. The staff held our bags for us while we roamed around Dublin. They messaged us when our room was ready. Room was spacious, comfortable. Staff very accommodating.",5,2023,03,31
215,AVOID THIS HOTEL,"DO NOT STAY HERE.  Had so many issues with this hotel I don't even know where to begin.  They are understaffed, the hotel smells weird at times (like old socks), and had a pair of athletic shoes (?) stolen during my stay.  Also, on our second day, after a long day of walking around, we returned to our room (which had been given turndown service) to find half of the bed SOAKING WET.  No idea what the liquid was, and don't want to know, but given there was NO HOUSEKEEPING AROUND that time of night, we had to blow-dry the bed in order to sleep.  

Not to mention, the A/C barely worked, so we'd wake up sweating every night... and when I asked for someone to come look at it, they kept telling us that it did in fact work, but that we had to give it 20 minutes to kick on.  Nope... just didn't work.

Design of the room makes no sense either.  The shower is weirdly arranged so that you can't stand under the overhead shower head without a piece of metal (from the second / handheld removable shower head) jamming into your side.  Asked multiple times for more soap / mugs for our room one night, but again, no housekeeping there, so had to go down there myself to retrieve them.

Some of the staff seems to be trying, but the place is severely understaffed.  Others were just straight up rude.  Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.",1,2023,03,29
215,Very poor quality,Awful hotel.  Poor cleanliness.  No atmosphere.  Rooms all look the same.  The room has hair on the floor and even when it was changed and cleaned it made no difference.  The restaurant is nothing more than a bar.,1,2023,03,27
215,Great hotel in a nice location.,"A sophisticated hotel in a great area. Upon arrival this was the very first time i have ever arrived from the states in the morning and had a room ready. During St. Patrick‚Äôs Day week I was shocked! That alone was SO nice, and unexpected but very much appreciated. The room is modern, with ample space compared to European standards. They offer all toiletries (shampoo/conditioner) I note that because I spent 10 days traveling Ireland and this was the only hotel that offered shampoo and conditioner. Women definitely appreciate that! From what I could also tell they offer at least one outlet for the standard European C plug. I mention this for women US travelers that may have  a curling iron, etc they have purchased maybe on another trip visiting europe can use those in that particular outlet. 
Location is fantastic! A great location on the south side of Dublin that is close to the train station, small convenience store (with atm at Centra) and local, fun restaurants! Would recommend this hotel to any friends or family,",5,2023,03,26
215,Recent Stay at The Alex Dublin,"Usual standard at the Alex! What is there to fault!! All perfect thank you. Check In/Out seamless thank you Anais. Jason, appreciate kindness when departing shown to my colleague, with the offer of the pastries! Needless to say like myself a convert. Look forward to my next stay. Kindest regards to all. Alan    ",5,2023,03,26
215,Excellent,"The stay at the Alex was wonderful. In terms of location it is perfect for the city and also the University. The rooms are spacious and the shower is wonderful. At breakfast in particular I had Abdul and Sandra look after me for my stay of 5 days and they are wonderful. So kind, considerate and professional. ",5,2023,03,22

215,Top-notch experience,"We were only at The Alex for one night as we were passing through to another town, but the hotel catered to our every need. We were traveling with students to attend a debate competition. We needed certain bedding arrangements which the hotel easily accommodated. We had a slight problem in our room and a staff member came immediately and took care of it. When we returned from the small town after we'd checked out, the staff allowed us to store our bags while walking around Dublin before our flight. The customer service was outstanding. I do wish they offered an a la carte alternative for breakfast, but that's a minor point. We greatly enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying again!",5,2023,03,13
215,Business Trip,"Good Location. Compared to London it was expensive and the ambience was rather cold.

Room was ok but there was a comfy bed. Clean and decent bathroom on par with what you would expect. Thought breakfast was steep at ¬£25 per head. ",3,2023,03,11
215,The Alex was (Almost) Perfectly Awesome,"Beautiful, large rooms with modern, minimalist decor. The bed was amazing! Everything was great, from the bathroom to the blackout curtains. Great location, too. The only complaint was circumstantial: the fire alarm (test?) woke us up at 6 am, which completely ruined our day. As long as that isn‚Äôt a regular thing (which I assume it‚Äôs not), then I definitely recommend staying here! ",5,2023,03,07
215,A good hotel.,"I would stay here again. Rooms very comfy and the beds are to die for!! 

A few niggles. No mini bar in room which I would have expected for a suite. The executive lounge needs attention. Greta idea but used it 4 times and each time there was no milk in the machine and no bottle opener. ",4,2023,03,07
215,Great stay,"Lovely hotel. Perfectly located for Trinity College and Grafton St shopping. Clean, nicely decorated and with friendly, attentive yet unobtrusive staff.

215,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Food, Comfortable Stay and Fantastic Staff!","The hotel was absolutely Amazing! We had one of the most comfortable sleeps ever, and the staff were extremely helpful & welcoming. Breakfast was fantastic and had a brilliantly fresh selection to choose from. To top that all off, we got some superb recommendations from a super helpful staff member, (Aaron O'Sullivan), for an evening out in Dublin Town Centre, and every single place he recommended was 10 out of 10! It literally made our evening so much more memorable that we could have expected. We will definitely be visiting The Alex Hotel Dublin again in the very near future!",5,2023,03,06

The room has a good size, comfortable bed, functional bathroom surrounded with outstanding design furniture. The room also has robe, slippers, coffee machine, kettle, toiletries, iron,... Everything you need is available.
Staff are very welcoming, professional and helpful - a 10/10!
Food in the restaurant was nice, I had a delicious soup and vegan pasta. The breakfast selection is good too.

215,Would stay at the hotel again,Rooms were a little too warm and i could turn the heating off. Needed more drinking water in the room. Check in service was good although could have been better with the parking instructions. Room cleanliness and other amenities were great,4,2023,02,02
215,Nice and friendly hotel,"Within walking distance of everything, clean and friendly hotel. Comfy beds. Breakfast was great. Staff always friendly, 

 Only two things wasn¬¥t perfect: unclear when checkout time was, the cardholder (the paper one with the cards in it when we arrived) said  12/noon, staff said  11. Could be clearer, why not state it in the information letter we reieved upon arrival, for example. 

2: we recieved wrong info about the pick up point when going to the airport. We even asked for direction twice just to be sure. t It wasn`t even the correct street. This could have been a very stressful situation if we had been late for check in at the airport. This is something you would expect staff to know, especially since it was in the neighbourhood. 

Other than that, we were very Happy with our stay at the Alex. ",4,2023,01,30
215,"Rooms are nice, beds are very comfy, staff are great, hotel just lacked atmosphere when we stayed.","Rooms are nice, beds are very comfy, staff are great, hotel just lacked atmosphere when we stayed.  Also beware the 11am checkout, not midday as advertised in many places. There isn‚Äôt much more to say which is why it‚Äôs only four stars. There is just something lacking here. I feel bad for staying it as it‚Äôs not the staff, they are so friendly welcoming and helpful. i guess for the price I suppose I expect to have a bit more of an experience. Maybe it‚Äôs because it is January and so it is not very busy, maybe the price is actually very competitive and Dublin is just expensive. I just don‚Äôt know. I regularly stay on an ibis style in Zurich with more about it! That said, the bed was super comfy so it was a great nights sleep.",4,2023,01,30

From arranging the meeting with Daphne on the Events team, to being taken care of so well on the day by Evenor and Aaron and last minute requests to Gareth & the team on reception, nothing was too much of a request. Thanks to all & we will be back again!",5,2023,01,27
215,Boutique style in the heart of Dublin,Exceptional service in this stylish boutique style hotel which is reasonably priced (for Dublin) and pretty central for both business and pleasure purposes. Only fault is the Bar/Breakfast Room/Restaurant which are all one in the same. But the positives far outweigh that one negative.,5,2023,01,21
215,The Alex - Perfect for Business and Great Location for Leisure,From check in to the bar and facilities - The Alex is Top Notch for Dublin. The room is roomy and the staff are friendly. The cafe and bar are really nice and the property is located next to one of our favorite pubs - The Gingerman. Highly recommend!,5,2023,01,17
215,Great Hotel,"I stayed at The Alex for a week on business. It's a great hotel; lots of a options for breakfast, large quiet rooms and comfy beds! The staff are friendly and very accommodating. 

It's also very conveniently located in town.",5,2023,01,17
215,Outstanding stay,"Everything was absolutely exceptional at The Alex. The design, upkeep and cleanliness of the hotel deserves an A+. The staff was amazing. Gerath, the manager was outstanding. He went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I had a fantastic stay. Irving was very helpful as well. 
The food and drinks at the Alex are delicious. The location couldn‚Äôt have been better. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin. ",5,2023,01,16
215,Family stay at the Alex,Great stay at the Alex. The staff at check in were great. We were a bit concerned about the 4pm check in as it is very late but luckily 1 of our rooms was ready early so we were able to leave the bags etc in it and set off see Dublin!,5,2023,01,16
215,"Clean, spacious and modern hotel","Loved our stay and will definitely be back. Warm welcome when we checked in, we were kindly given an upgrade. You can check in and out online to save time. The room was extremely clean, spacious and modern. Would happily recommend to people looking for a central hotel in Dublin. ",5,2023,01,15
215,One night stay,"I found the Alex great for a place to lay my head after some post work drinks, then wake up for have a pleasant shower and good breakfast before heading back to office.

If there was a slight negative it was that kitchen was closed when I reached the hotel (22:30-ish). But reception quickly rang the pub around the corner to check they were still serving food, which they were. The pub was seconds away and they were expecting me we I arrive. Like I said not quite a negative overall ‚ò∫Ô∏è.",5,2023,01,13
215,Steam cafe,"Best Barista in Dublin
Dariuz makes the best coffee in dublin! Such a lovely,friendly guy and we are lucky to have him on fenian street. It is rare you meet someone who always has a smile and a warm welcome as well as making the perfect coffee.",5,2023,01,11
215,Lovely Stay,"We were a big fan of the Alex, and would stay again. It's quite central to most attractions by car, and within walking distance to the Temple Bar area (10-15 min walk). The rooms were clean. The staff was attentive and friendly. Seamless check in and check out process.",5,2023,01,10
215,Disappointing service,Very Nice staff but the service in the bar in the evenings was not good at all. Slow and unresponsive. Lack of atmosphere also - it should have been nice to have had some Christmas decorations/music as it was 3 days before Christmas.,4,2023,01,09
215,New Years Stay,"Great hotel with a nice design led look. Just outside the main bars and shops but only a short walk into town mean it is convenient yet quiet. A great stay, big rooms with very comfortable beds and reasonable prices.",5,2023,01,04
215,Perfect Stay,"We stayed at The Alex for a few days after our wedding. The staff were amazing, so helpful and welcoming. Breakfast is excellent, good range of quality food. There is a lovely bar area too! Can‚Äôt recommend enough. ",5,2023,01,02
215,Perfect First Impression of Dublin,The Alex made for the perfect accomodations as a solo female traveler. The staff was friendly throughout and I must make mention of them offering an available room as soon as I arrived following a 6 a.m. landing in Dublin. The rooms are well appointed and the location could not be better.,5,2022,12,26
215,"No running water for majority of stay, staff not very accommodating. Interior and design of hotel nice","No running water for majority of stay, staff not very accommodating. Interior and design of hotel nice. Restaurant shut morning of checking out and hotel unable to store luggage. Staff in restaurant day or check in were attentive ",2,2022,12,24
215,Couldn't Recommend The Alex more!,"The Alex was perfect, in a great location and walkable to all of the fun Dublin areas! The staff was amazing and friendly, offering local recommendations and allowing us to check our bags while we waited for our rooms. I would stay here again if traveling to Dublin! ",5,2022,12,19
215,Great food,"Stopped into the Alex for food before viewing the lights is merrion park with my daughter
She claims was the best burger she's had 
Fish and chips was great little pricey but still great staff  who in the bar was very professional Kudos to all",4,2022,12,19
215,A wonderful banqueting team ...,"It was our pleasure to host an event at The Alex on behalf of one of our clients. From the initial enquiry and planning with Daphne through to the event operation with Aaron, Jonathan, Evanora and Owen, it was a great experience. And the culinary team made sure that we were all well fed and satisfied once the business of the day was done. We are delighted to recommend The Alex Hotel for corporate meetings. ",4,2022,12,14
215,Three night stay,"Having to travel light I confirmed with the hotel before our visit that there would be shampoo, conditioner and body wash. On arrival there was no conditioner so we had to buy some. No remote for the TV and the hairdryer was broken. Both replaced. No toilet brush. Lighting is dull unless makeup and hair is done in the bathroom. .I understand that the hotel adopts an eco system for the heating between 8pm and 8am so the room was very cold all day. A member of staff showed me how to work the heating in the room and also offered extra blankets! Despite numerous attempts the heating did not come out of the vents. Staying 8-11th Dec it was extremely cold unless we sat under our duvets. Breakfast was plentiful but the dining room was cold because the doors were left open and opposite the main doors that opened constantly letting people in and out also letting the cold through to the dining room. On a positive note, the rooms were cleaned and stocked beautifully and the staff were accommodating .But at ¬£168 a night I believe this hotel is ovepriced.",3,2022,12,14
215,Great buffet breakfast,"We had a great time at this hotel. It was clean and modern. Also, it was within walking distance of the city center and close to the hop on and off buses. We really enjoyed the breakfast (a favorite on our trip) The rooms are good (not fancy) but we had everything we needed, and it suited us just fine.",5,2022,12,06
215,The best staff and a very comfortable hotel!,"The Alex is a great hotel in a very lovely location, our stay was perfect. The staff went over and above to accommodate us in advance and during our trip, with care, kindness and little extras here and there. We will certainly return again due to this!",5,2022,12,05
215,Disappointing! Rip-off,"Very Disappointing.
1.  classic ‚Äúgreen washing‚Äù (‚Äòeco-& sustainable- blablablabla ‚Äô) however towels cannot (cannot!) be  hung anywhere in the bathroom, so end up on floor and will be replaced.
2. Room rate is horribly overpriced
3. Badly (not?) trained staff.
I could write more‚Ä¶.",1,2022,12,04
215,Terrible hotel,"We paid 399,00 Euro per night  for a small room‚Ä¶ Very environmentally unfriendly ... there is no possibility to hang the bath towels to dry, so they are renewed every day... our room was not cleaned... breakfast was very poor... bad, cheap quality, tea and coffee tasted like bitter, lukewarm liquid ... front desk staff poorly trained... a big disappointment....",1,2022,12,04
215,Excellent stay,Really valued being able to book a room last minute and check in. The actual travel had killed me and rest in the room was exactly what I needed. Room service was great and and staff was super friendly. And extra points for hot chocolate!,5,2022,12,03
215,A great stay,"The Alex Hotel provided our family with a great place to start our Dublin-experience.  We arrived early and asked them to watch our bags - with no issue.  Once we got into the room, we found a roomy apartment that was absolutely perfect.  The location is right within walking distance of Trinity and all of Dublin's sites.  All of the hotel employees were extremely kind and helpful.  We would absolutely enjoy staying at the Alex Hotel again.  Thank you for a great stay!",5,2022,12,01
215,The Alex Hotel,"Stayed for one night.  Very nice hotel with helpful and friendly staff.  The hotel is in a good location and only a short walk from Pearse Station.  We enjoyed our stay very much, and we would stay again.",5,2022,12,01
215,"Lovely, clean, excellent staff","3 things make or break a lodging: the rooms, the services and the staff. I rate all 3 of those very highly for The Alex. The staff was as friendly and helpful as they could be, the rooms were clean and spacious with an enormous bed and the food at the lobby retaurant kept us full and happy. 

Well-located - easy walk to the Hop-On/Hop-Off stop #4 and the Oscar Wilde House. Several lovely pubs just down thes street (The Kennedy and Ginger Man), a convenience store just around the corner - very convenient.

When back in Dublin we will definitely stay again at The Alex.",5,2022,11,30
215,Great looking hotel - right in the centre!,"The Alex is really in the centre of it all.  The design of the lobby and rooms really is excellent.  It feels classy and cool at the same time.  There is a sense of space that mostly feels good, but can also at times make it feel a bit empty (and by this I mean you sometimes weren't sure where the staff were).

The real winner here are the rooms, which to be fair is where you spend most of your time.  It really felt super upmarket, pristine and modern.",4,2022,11,30
215,Exceptional common-sense service,"I stayed here on a business trip in late November 2022. The package I had offered dinner on arrival, but I arrived too late to get this.* The hotel offered several alternatives to ensure I still received the full value of the package, even though I don't believe they were under any obligation to do so.

Check-in, check-out, room quality, and food were all perfect - as was the conference room for the forum I was attending that day.

*This was not the hotel's fault; I arrived very late.",5,2022,11,29
215,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Everyone working at the hotel was super friendly while being professional, and very efficient.  Loved the location and the included breakfast was excellent.  Garrett, the reception area manager was amazing with his personable demeanor and his willingness to answer our questions about Ireland/ Dublin. ",5,2022,11,29
215,Fabulous,"The hotel was in the center of town, and the staff were fantastic, including the manager who helped me take my food to my room. That was great!!! The food in the restaurant was also very good. I would have liked to have more access to midnight snacks so if you want snacks bring them to the hotel because there were none available after 9 ish. I have no complaints otherwise. It was perfect otherwise. ",5,2022,11,28
215,Great hotel,"Good location. Very clean and modern. Beds incredibly comfortable, bathrooms modern and lovely. Staff were all very friendly. Didn‚Äôt use the restaurant or gym, or explore the hotel much - too many things to see and do in Dublin ",5,2022,11,28
215,Lovely staff,"Lovely staff, clean rooms and loved the decor.

Location very central. My only criticism is that there were no bar snacks to purchase which I always find disappointing when you are drinking alcohol. However a lovely staff member got us some crisps which she delivered to our room! ",5,2022,11,28
215,Good hotel for 3-4 days,"Good hotel, practically in the center of Dublin city. Incredibly friendly staff, especially the very friendly girls (Paula and Patricia) who helped with recommendations for walking around the city.
Will definitely try to stay at this hotel on my next visit to Dublin",4,2022,11,27
215,Stained sheets and smoke smell,"The service at the desk and the manager seemed good. They helped with parking and said they would help with the smoke smell,we encountered,Apologized. But the smoke smell didn‚Äôt stop. It says its a four star hotel. At most it‚Äôs a two and half star hotel. Bed was nice. Room was cute. Staff was friendly. ",3,2022,11,27
215,Misleading Information,"The plugs in the room didn't work....couldn't charge my phone. The gym isnt in the hotel. The check out is 11am despite being told it was noon. The phone didn't work. And, worst of all, the bed felt like 10000 people had slept in it.",1,2022,11,24
215,Very Enjoyable Stay!,"The Alex Hotel is conveniently located as it is walkable to the Dublin site highlights.  More importantly, The Alex Hotel staff was super check-in friendly and helpful in recommending restaurants and pubs frequented by the local populace.  Our sleeping and bathroom areas were very well appointed.  A special note:  The walls are such that we did not hear our neighbors.  Would definitely stay there again.  ",5,2022,11,23
215,Warning ‚õîÔ∏è We had our Wedding Rings Stolen here,"Your belongings are not safe here!

Unfortunately I have to review this hotel as one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. I have never written a review of this nature before but in the interest of other people‚Äôs safety, feel I must. 

Our wedding was taking place in a city centre venue, so we chose to stay at The Alex on the Friday night before the wedding for 3 nights. For the Friday night ahead of a Saturday wedding, the Groom and his best man stayed in a twin room and I stayed in the suite. 

At check-in I asked the male receptionist at front desk if he could assist us because we had a lot of luggage etc, he brought out the bell hop trolley and left. Myself and my partner wheeled it back in from the car, wondering where he had gone. Then my partner left to take the car to the car park as I checked in. I then asked for assistance with the trolley to the room and he said ‚Äúno, you can take it yourself‚Äù. I asked if he was serious as I thought he was joking. When he explained he was serious, I asked for a supervisor. He said ok and called someone. A man walked up to reception, I thought I this was the supervisor, but he just went behind the desk to work and the original receptionist said ‚ÄúI can assist you now because I‚Äôm not on my own‚Äù. Not a great start. 

We had a really nice dinner later that evening in the garden area and the waitress was excellent- this was my only positive experience of the stay. 

The morning of the wedding was hectic, as you can imagine, but long story short, my daughter took the luggage from the twin room and brought it to the suite as the guys were busy sorting out the wedding car. They were supposed to have checked out at 1 but due to problems with the car had come back to check out at 1:30. The female receptionist on at that time said nothing to them about key cards or checking the room. 

The grooms party arrived at the wedding venue and promptly realised they had left the rings in the room. Panicked, the best man called reception and told her what had happened and that my brother was on the way to collect them. She hung up on him. He rang back again and spoke with a man this time, he explained all over again and the man said he was sending the female receptionist up to get the ring boxes. When she arrived down she told the best man she had the boxes, he asked her to open them to check they were ok. She said she didn‚Äôt know how to open the boxes. He pressed her to open them as it‚Äôs not difficult, she eventually did and then told him in the most uncaring, indifferent way that the boxes were empty. 

Side note: we were subsequently told she went to the twin room to look for key cards after checkout (strange). Whereas the best man was told she went into their room after checkout because someone in the bridal party in the suite had asked her to. This did not happen. 

You can infer from the above what transpired, needless to say we were devastated and this caused untold stress right before our ceremony and cast a shadow across the happiness of the big day. We celebrated and took joy in our day despite what happened but can‚Äôt let it go without warning others of the thievery. 

The hotel conducted an investigation and found nothing. The Director of Operations was empathetic and good at updating us but ultimately nothing was done and the fact remained that our rings were stolen from the room and no one is being made accountable.

Even if you take the rings out of the equation, the staff are poorly trained and were ill equipped to work in hospitality.  My biggest regrets ever, is choosing to stay here.",1,2022,11,23
215,Comfortable and delighted at The Alex in Dublin.,"Everyone is very kind and very informative,  at the front desk of the lobby and in the restaurant. My room was taken care of very nicely. The breakfast and dinner was perfect. Thank you to every one of your employees for taking very good care of me. Sincerely, Roberta Bordeaux",5,2022,11,21
215,Unpleasant sleeping experience,"Scratchy sheets (across four different beds, so it wasn't a one off) and an overly warm room made sleeping uncomfortable and unpleasant. Real shame as the staff were very friendly and accommodating, the decor is really lovely, breakfast and dining area very nice and it's in a great location. But if you can't get a good night's sleep, what's the point? Especially at the price you pay for this hotel.",2,2022,11,19
215,"Nice hotel,  excellent value","A very nice hotel, much more  reasonably priced than most of the  overpriced 5 star hotels in Dublin.   Excellent location, within  a 5 or 10 walk of all the downtown action.   Clean and well maintained modern rooms.  Front desk staff were very friendly and very  helpful.   ",5,2022,11,17
215,Helping family with business conference,"The stuff were so lovely throughout. The two staff, evenor and Pedro, who served us were amazing. They were so friendly and very helpful. Always checking up and making sure we had everything we needed. 10/10",5,2022,11,17
215,Beautiful hotel and courteous staff,"Stayed overnight at this beautiful hotel which is centrally located, offers spacious rooms, good breakfast and great service. Check-in and out was seamless, staff very courteous and rooms super clean. ",4,2022,11,16
215,Book your event at The Alex!,"Was here for a work function and overall, it was a great experience. Particularly the staff helping with the event, Evenor, Mario, and Pedro S. There was also a lovely lady that went out of her way to get us some oat milk for our tea, but didn't get her name. They all really did a fantastic job. Very attentive to us and assisted with food needs, going above and beyond to cater to us. Room was lovely and comfortable as well. We had sandwiches for lunch, which were very tasty. If you need to book a corporate event, The Alex is your place!",5,2022,11,15
215,A lovely stay,Really like the location of the hotel.  It is clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The bedroom was very comfortable and I slept well in the bed.  The hairdryer did not work but everything else was great.  This was my second visit and I will come again.,5,2022,11,12
215,Not what you would expect for the cost,This hotel feels cheaply set up and they cut corners. Our room was half made up when we arrived at 10pm. Breakfast had been sitting out for hours which is crazy at ‚Ç¨25 a pop. The staff were not overly helpful - we got no information on arrival. For almost ‚Ç¨900 for three nights I would stay almost anywhere else next time. It was fine but not what you would expect for that money. ,3,2022,11,07
215,"Lovely hotel, great design","Great hotel. Easily walkable to everything without being in the middle of it all. Front desk was great and friendly, design of everything was well thought out. Would definitely stay again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2022,11,06
215,On your own at The Alex,"We were at the Alex for nearly two weeks.  Staff were reasonably friendly and professional, but made no effort to problem solve and help guests resolve issues--guests are generally on their own.  For example, The Alex listing on websites says parking is available, and when we asked about parking at check-in, and were told parking was available for guest through a 3rd party garage.   We were NOT told that parking was based on limited availability and not guaranteed.  So, after we picked up our rental car three days into our trip and needed the parking, we were told it was full and not available.  Staff made absolutely no effort to help us find other parking; we were told to use google.  We spent 2 hours of our vacation looking for overnight parking.

There was no assistance available to help with luggage; even after we asked for help we were not even offered a luggage cart.  Guests are on their own to move their luggage from the curb/parking space on the street in front of the hotel to the room, which is typical of lower level hotels, but not of hotels in the category of the Alex.

The daily room refresh was poor.  Each day, housekeeping staff failed to fully refresh the room; several days no coffee was refreshed; the milk was not replaced; no sweetner was provided; glasses and cups were left unchanged; we only received one clean towel instead of two; etc.

Amenities listed by the hotel on websites are false/deceptive. Example: ""laundry"" is listed as an amenity, but it does not exist at the Alex; they only provide dry cleaning service. This was a major fail because we were there for two weeks and counted on in-house laundry. Same with breakfast; it is listed as amenity but requires an undisclosed charge; we assumed it was included, compared to the restaurant -- also a listed amenity -- which one would assume that has additional costs, but the restaurant and breakfast they are exactly the same thing.",4,2022,11,05
215,A MUST stay in Dublin,"We booked this hotel for a week while visiting our daughter who is studying abroad.  Simply put, the hotel and the staff were fantastic!!  I am a former COO for a US Hotel Chain and am quite picky of hotel accommodations, but this hotel hit the mark each and every time!  From Gareth at the front desk who could not be more accommodation, to the beautiful, big rooms which were spotless and featured a wonderful shower and coffee with tons of closet space and drawers for our weeks stay.  Housekeeping was amazing, the breakfast was great, and I cannot think of one thing they could have done differently.  The location was good, close to Grafton Street, everything was walkable, and it was quiet.  Congratulations to the owners, management and staff.  Job well done!  We will be back.",5,2022,11,05
215,Pleasant stay,We had a very pleasant stay. It is an expensive hotel but I‚Äòd argue that it‚Äòs worth the money. The rooms a very pretty and clean and the staff was (except for one) helpful and friendly. The breakfast was also excellent but I would not necessarily recommend the restaurant for dinner. The food was good but not really exciting for the high prices. The location of the hotel is also amazing :),5,2022,11,05
215,The Alex Review,"Great place in a great location. Right across from The Ginger Man, a great Irish pub, and down the street from Kennedy‚Äôs, an Oscar Wilde favorite and always lively with the Trinity College crowd. Front desk help was awesome, even though I can‚Äôt remember his name. I had a 50 euro bill for him when we checked out, but unfortunately he wasn‚Äôt working. Rooms are great, showers are great, beds are super comfortable. Breaker tripped a few times while we were there but it was no biggie to reset and it happens a lot in Dublin. Overall, this was a great hotel for our first trip to Dublin, and although we may branch out to other hotels on future trips, the Alex will always be our first and most memorable experience. I highly recommend staying here.",5,2022,11,03
215,It was fine,"The room was fine, bed was comfortable. Relatively quiet (noise wise) for a city centre hotel. They seem to push checking in and out online so less face time with staff. Service is very slow and majority of staff seemed to not want to make eye contact, speak or even serve customers in any way. The breakfast was poor. 50 euro for breakfast for two and it was grim. Would skip the breakfast there and go to Tang next door. Also a nice restaurant and bar across the road called Note which was much more welcoming. ",3,2022,11,01
215,Bank Holiday Weekend October 2022,"Excellent Location, nice breakfast and spacious rooms. We wanted to be central and be able to get to the Bord Gas theatre on Saturday night - it was a short walk that took no time at all. Then on Sunday we wanted to be in the Dawson and Grafton area - again just a short walk and very pleasant. Monday we strolled through Trinity and all very close to this hotel. We will be back",4,2022,11,01
215,A great marathon experience.,I was in for the Dublin marathon 2022.  Stayed at the Alex hotel.  It was a great location and experience.  Everyone was very courteous and professional.  The room was amazing.  I would stay here again. Thanks.,5,2022,11,01
215,Great stay and amazing staff,The hotel is very well appointed and the staff went above and beyond to ensure I had a great stay. The hote is in a good location as well. I was on a long stay in Europe which included a golf trip. I stayed at the Alex at the beginning of my trip as well as the end. They helped me with my luggage situation for my trip.,5,2022,10,31
215,Great location for our stay at Dublin,"There was 6 of us who recently stayed at The Alex while in Dublin for my son‚Äôs graduation at Trinity.  The location couldn‚Äôt be better.  So quick to get to Trinity and just a few more steps to reach Grafton street, Temple Bar‚Ä¶but all at a location that is quiet.  We slept with the window open and had to noise that kept us up.  The staff is very accommodating and the rooms are very comfortable‚Äîlove the beds.  Got restful sleep while there!",5,2022,10,31
215,One of best locations near City Center!,"If you are looking for 5 star room and service at affordable price, the Alex is a good start!  We arrived without any difficulties and since we drove in the parking was exceptionally close to hotel!
Cost was perfect too!  ",5,2022,10,29
215,Great Hotel,"One of the best hotels we stayed at travelling

215,Biggest bed I've ever had in a hotel!,Absolutely loved my stay at the Alex Hotel. The bed is massive and extremely comfy. Definitely recommend. The location is a 15 minute walk from temple bar and right around the corner from Trinity College.,5,2022,10,27
215,Loved it!,"Modern, clean, friendly hotel. Would gladly stay again. It‚Äôs also in a great area and close to a lot of the must see attractions in Dublin. The bartender was super nice as well. Overall an amazing stay.",5,2022,10,26
215,Very pleasant stay in The Alex,"Very pleasant stay in The Alex Hotel. Very hospital welcoming at reception, bedrooms are comfortable and a good size with a extra-large king-size bed. DId not use the restaurant or bar but all appear very nice and like the shared working space in the main foyer.",4,2022,10,26
215,Clean and nice location,"Modern, clean, good spot. The beds are comfortable and the rooms quiet. We had a booking that included breakfast, which was delicious and nice so we didn‚Äôt have to look for first first thing. I enjoyed the atmosphere as well.",4,2022,10,23
215,Wonderful hotel in perfect location,"My husband and I stayed in this beautiful hotel for our first few nights in Dublin prior to  the start of our 7 day coach tour of Ireland and had planned to stay in a different hotel on our return but loved this one so much that we tried to book it upon our return, sadly to no avail. It is a stately hotel, beautifully appointed and extremely well staffed. The welcome was warm and helpful. Our room was spacious, well appointed and had all the amenities expected of a first class hotel. The bedding was comfortable and the bathroom was large and immaculate. We enjoyed delicious breakfasts every morning and drinks at the bar one evening. It was located in the city such that we could walk to all of the sights on our list easily. We also stopped in to a bar a couple of blocks away that was great fun. If we ever return to Dublin, we will definitely stay at the Alex.",5,2022,10,22
215,Great stay in Dublin,"Great place to stay in Dublin. Within walking distance to City Center. Walked to shopping, Trinity College, Book of Kells. Staff was helpful with luggage- we had a LOT!! Breakfast buffet was lovely. Bedroom was quiet, comfy and gave us a good night's rest.",4,2022,10,17
215,Ireland trip,Clean and very comfortable hotel in a nice area of the city and very central. Really nice and helpful staff especially Gareth and the really nice Irish Lady with the nice smile and dark hair at the restaurant. Really good breakfast and food generally.,5,2022,10,16
215,"Style, Comfort, and Proximity!",My partner and I traveled to Dublin for a wedding. The Alex was recommended to us by a local friend. We couldn't have been happier with our stay. The room was spacious and beautifully styled. The design did not lack comfort. The bed and pillows provided a GREAT sleep and I'm a finicky sleeper. We were a short walk to all the sights we wanted to see and tons of delicious restaurants. The next time I come to Dublin I'll definitely be staying here again!,5,2022,10,14
215,Dublin,Excellent hotel--very clean and quiet. Coffee spot on site is a plus! Very easy to get to major attractions and easy access to bus. Excellent spot for visitors to Trinity College! Rooms are spacious and updated with tech necessities for international travelers.,5,2022,10,13
215,The Alex Hotel,"I have been to the Alex Hotel several times and each time I am more and more pleasantly surprised.It is very pleasant to have meetings here.

Thank you!!",5,2022,10,10
215,Highly recommend staying at The Alex Hotel,"Check in was quick and friendly. Our room was cosy, clean and comfortable.
The Manager, Gerard went above and beyond to make sure our stay was most enjoyable.
My favourite was the breakfast buffet which was outstanding and generous.",5,2022,10,08
215,Dublin,"Very busy city  !!! the hop on  hop off bus was worth it very good way to see the city.The stop was just short walk from Alex  The Alex gave us breakfast to go since we had to leave before the  breakfast bar was open It was very helpfull and  they where very helpfull 
 with phone calls Very nice place and in central area ...",5,2022,10,07
215,A very great experience,"We spent the weekend in Dublin and we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay: the area is quiet to rest, but very close to the center, pubs and parks. The hotel is modern, clean and has friendly service. We also had a nice lunch there aswell.",5,2022,10,04
215,Beautiful Hotel,"My first impression was ultimate excitement when I realized the vibe was totally art deco.  I couldn't have been happier.
The rooms were large with plenty of seating space etc... in addition to comfy beds.
The restaurant was phenomenal with extremely attentive staff.
Check in was easy and the employees were extremely helpful with every need I required.  (Early morning taxi service with an option of a ""to-go"" breakfast, deliveries of our much needed still water and so forth.)
The location is great!  We found that almost everything was within walking distance of this hotel!
I can't wait to revisit!  Thanks!",5,2022,10,02
215,The Alex Hotel,"It was pleasure to have meetings here.Food and drinks where delicious.All compliments to the chef.Team who was with us all the time it‚Äôs unbelievable,proffesional and full of positive ebergy.Thanks to Marco for organising everything we need.Big compliment for Mr.Evenor who where answering on every our question.",5,2022,09,30
215,Not a fan!,"The elevator was out so we had to lug our own suitcases up flights of stairs by ourselves.  Might not be for everyone.
Budget hotel all around.  A bit dingy.  No light by the bed. No nightstand either.  No washcloths, only hand towels and towels.",2,2022,09,28
215,Fantastic Hotel in very desirable area of Dublin,"This hotel is a designer's dream stay.  The colors and textures throughout the hotel are stunning and provide a very rich and comforting atmosphere without any of the fussy clutter that no one likes.  Every detail has been considered, especially the little special touches such as lights and fixtures.  The staff was lovely and very helpful at check-in and with questions about local restaurants, etc.  I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2022,09,27
215,Great location and wonderful rooms,"After a few stumbles with website booking (website malfunctions) and some subsequent miscommunications we found The Alex to be a lovely hotel in a good location (near Trinity College and an easy walk to Temple Bar) with modern, class, flawless rooms. The restaurant needs a bit of work on service (at least at dinner) but the front desk staff was friendly. I recommend this hotel.",4,2022,09,26
215,Safety and Security Compromised.,"Having stayed in The Alex previously, we were looking forward to another pleasant stay. This did not happen. Reception staff appeared untrained and nervous and were unable to handle the simplest of enquiries. My request for the bathroom extractor to be repaired was ignored.
While we were out, our room 102 was entered by persons unknown and goods were taken. We use the inroom safe, so valuables and documents were not touched. Acknowledgement of this event was slow to be reported and I had top ask at reception for any information. Our door entry system was scanned.No offer was made to change our keys. We were told that it would take several days to find out what had happened and we were promised a full report. The goods were replaced. We have heard nothing more other that a request to rate our stay!
This was an unsettling occurrence during our stay at the Alex, which one would not like to repeat.The senior staff were most reluctant to try to explain what might have occurred.
Having had a look at previous reviews I came across a guests experience of being given the key to an already occupied room, and guess what, it was Room 102!

215,Amazing Conference,"Davenport and Alex are two amazing property‚Äôs starting from the conference venues to rooms and restaurants.We had lunch in The Alex and food is delicious.Coctails are prepared with attention on every ingredient.Sammythe bartender high class.Speical i need to mention Mr.Marko and his amazing team.Patryk and Evenor are proffesional and aswell so positive.Three of them make our day easy and calm.

Thank you for everything folks and see you again!",5,2022,09,22
215,Great location saves on cabs; silly things make it less than excellent,"My wife and I spent four nights here. On the plus side: staff responsiveness; great AC (important because the outside customers at the bar next door meant you couldn't keep the window open at night; great shower, very good breakfast options, even for someone needing gluten-free. On the minus side: typical ""King"" bed made up of two twins, but rather than the typical well between them, a filler that made the middle higher, so that each person tended to roll off the bed; no hooks in the bath; shampoo & body wash in ridiculous plastic containers that don't stay up, and are good for maybe two washes each; their The Carriage Restaurant and Bar supposedly requires a reservation, but it rarely had more than a couple of table occupied outside of breakfast. It had a really limited dinner menu, but they tried to make one dish gluten-free: their Seafood Skillet ( ‚Ç¨25.00) was really a Garbanzo Skillet, with three separated shrimp heads, just two shrimp bodies, a few mussels and three small pieces of fish, overwhelmed with a full can of garbanzos.  That said, we might stay here again, or at one of their sister hotels across the street.",4,2022,09,21
215,Great location but lacking a few areas,"We were on the end of the first floor and it was quite noisy from the street below.  There is nowhere to hang bath towels and we had to ask for our towels to be replaced.  The carpets in the hallways are quite stained.  There are no clocks in the room and very few TV channels to pick from.  No wash cloths or top sheets, if you like that sort of thing.  ",3,2022,09,18
215,Great Room in a Great Spot,"The Alex is the perfect jumping off point for visiting Dublin Centre. The staff was knowledgeable and very helpful, and we found an amazing Italian restaurant, Cafe Napoli, right around the corner. Was able to walk to the Gaeity Theater and Trinity College and their laundry service was much appreciated!",5,2022,09,16
215,Just stay here!,The staff was very accommodating. The aesthetics of the hotel are beautiful. Pricing is fair for the accommodations and area. Great area for walking to other restaurants and Trinity area. Free WiFi and the showers were awesome. We were in Ireland for 10 days and sometimes we had the worst showers. Free breakfast but we were unable to partake. Overall we would stay here again if visiting the Dublin area. ,5,2022,09,13
215,Excelent hotel,"Very nice, new and well located. The breakfast was very good and the room was like the photos, completely new and very nice. Staff was always ready to help and ver efficient. The location is super, 10 mins walking max to anywhere",5,2022,09,12
215,I love this hotel,"I stayed at the Alex twice in the past year, and had absolutely wonderful stays both times. The staff is so lovely - they accommodated my early (6am arrival), even greeting me with a fresh latte on arrival. One of my visits was over my birthday, and the hotel sent up a gratis selection of desserts and drinks. The rooms are stylish, spacious, beautifully decorated, comfortable and quiet. The kettle and selection of teas, coffees and chocolates was much appreciated. Location is perfect for anything you might want to do in central Dublin, and just a couple blocks to Pearse station. Breakfast was incredible, with a huge selection and a beautiful outdoor patio. One of the best hotel experiences I've had.",5,2022,09,11
215,First Visit to Dublin,"We stayed at the Alex because it looked cute online, and our stay was amazing! Everyone was super nice and very helpful. The hotel is also focused on being eco friendly which is great. Breakfast was great, but make sure to clarify if it is or isn‚Äôt included in your rate. Staff was super helpful and kind and made our first few nights in Dublin really special!",5,2022,09,11
215,Great Hotel in a Good Location,We were booked in The Alex Hotel by Firebird Tours for the first two nights of our private tour. Our itinerary included our returning to Dublin. We planned to stay a few days after the tour and had booked another hotel in Temple Bar. We liked The Alex so much that we canceled the Temple Bar hotel and booked The Alex for the 4 nights we had on our own. What a good decision! It's such a comfortable hotel. We were on the 5th floor which gave us access to the 6th floor hospitality suite. We had a refrigerator and an electric kettle which are such nice touches. We also had access to the gym at The Mont Hotel which we enjoyed. The breakfast and coffee were wonderful! Staying at The Alex enhanced our stay tremendously!,5,2022,09,10
215,One night stay,Disappointed in this hotel...paid 440 euro for a twin room no breakfast for one night.   Staff not very friendly or helpful. Booked the secret garden for a meal at 4pm and food was very average. Shower not working well low pressure and waterfall head seemed to be blocked. Positives ...Room was spacious and bed was fab. No food available not even coffee or sandwich except set times but you can order in food. Booked a taxi which didn't turn up and staff weren't able to help saying it was busy...wished we had been warned it might not turn up. All in all very poor experience. Would not recommend.,3,2022,09,10
215,Overpriced Boutique Hotel,"High style and good location for business but overpriced.  Comfortable beds and goos breakfast.  Service was adequate but for price the shower should be spotless (not with pink mold in grout). Flexible stay is really not that flexible if you are booking for more than 1 night.
",3,2022,09,10
215,Event in Dublin,"We had event in Alex hotel.Rooms looks amazing and on professional level.Food its very delicious.Big thank you and appreciation to Marco and his lovely team.They help us with everything.

See you again Alex team.",5,2022,09,08
215,Always nice to come back,"We had a meeting in the Alex hotel with PWC.My second time in beautiful hotel and lovely meeting rooms.Cookies are amazing on the break time.Big thank you to Evenor,Patryk and their manager Marco.Team is professional and very approachable.

I hope to meet again!",5,2022,09,04
215,Quiet and Quality Stay,"A modern posh hotel with very comfortable beds and pretty rooms. The pubs nearby were fun, but it's a quiet neighborhood, at least on the weekends. (It seemed to be a more business type area). We were disappointed by the add-on features ""early check-in"" and ""cremant and chocolate"" and wouldn't recommend on purchasing anything other the room. ",5,2022,09,04
215,Mixed Reviews on The Alex,"We stayed at the Alex for three days in August 2022. While the hotel itself is very nice and well-located, the staff is largely unknowledgeable, poorly-trained, and unresponsive to customer concerns . For example, the first night our AC was not blowing any cold air and it was so hot that we could not sleep. And the window could only be opened a crack, which we did. Then it turned out that the window could not be opened without the AC automatically shutting off. No one had told us this when we checked in! As we complained about the AC, we kept getting different stories as to why it was not working. After several days of them claiming to be ""fixing it"", and it still not working, we concluded that the Alex deliberately keeps the temperature high in the guest rooms to save money. We had used a phone app to establish that the temperature in the lobby and restaurant was always a lovely and inviting 68-70 degrees, while in our room it was always 72-74 degrees! Only when I threatened a negative review on Trip Advisor, did the staff become at all responsive to our concerns. Although the AC situation never did improve, they compensated us with a free drink and a free breakfast. They were also very helpful in looking out for the delivery of luggage that our airline had lost. All of this adds up to a mixed review for the Alex.",3,2022,09,03
215,"Poor customer service, average hotel","We stayed here for 2 nights in 2 rooms.  We were traveling with our teenage daughters and were under the impression that we would have connecting rooms.  When we checked in we were initially given rooms on different floors.  This wasn‚Äôt going to work. After a few minutes they were able to find rooms next door to each other.  This worked just fine.  I am not sure why a family booked in 2 rooms with children would be given random rooms in the first place but‚Ä¶

The rooms were good, bathrooms a tad small but not surprising.  The doors do bang when they are shut so we did get woken up when people came in late.

The Alex is in a good location.  It is close to the center but also quietly tucked away.  

What we didn‚Äôt like was the customer service.  It didn‚Äôt exist.  I‚Äôm not asking for much.  I feel the entire staff was new and also untrained.  It was raining and while we had 2 umbrellas we brought with us, we wanted to borrow one.  Getting an umbrella was complicated..they keep random umbrellas behind the desk and tell you to return them.  Who doesn‚Äôt know that.  It is Dublin..you would like they would have Alex umbrellas in each room‚Ä¶or by the door‚Ä¶

Also, getting to the airport was a mess.  We went down to check out. They could not figure out how to print a receipt.  Not a big deal.  We asked about Uber and they said not to use it‚Ä¶that is was unreliable.  They said they would call us a cab.  So they call us a cab and we wait..only to be told 12 min later the cab cancelled.  They then tell us to call an Uber.  We try calling an Uber but they all keep canceling.  So we ask the front desk what are our options..they say because it is raining there are no large cabs.  We ask them to call us to smaller cabs so we can split up.  They try to..but in the mean time my husband found a nice taxi driver who agreed to take us.  There were lots of us trying to get to the airport and the front desk looked like deer in headlights.  There was no urgency and no plan.  While I understand it is not their fault - they should be prepared to assist in this situation.  

Bottom line - if you expect great customer service this is not the hotel for you.  If you just want a clean room and comfortable bed - and nothing else - the Alex might work.",3,2022,08,31
215,Bad start,"This was a birthday trip and the trip got off to a shakey start, we arrived at the hotel in the evening, only to be told our room was not available due to a plumbing issue. We were taken to another hotel for the evening. We had booked a Executive King room but were placed in a normal standard room at the replacement hotel. The next day we were moved back to The Alex and upgraded to a Suit. The staff were very apologetic and treated us very well. It was a bit of hastle having to pack our stuff again etc but these things happen. We were given complimentary breakfast and a bottle of proseco. The hotel is lovley but just a shame we couldn‚Äôt stay there for the two nights we booked.",5,2022,08,30
215,Wonderful staying,"Its our first time in Dublin and it was amazing.Hotel is located in city center.Rooms are clean and comfortable.Staff in the main bar should be more trained.Sebastian on reception was very helpful.I would like to mention Evenor and Marco they where very professional  and in the same time very friendly.We enjoyed our dinner.Thanks to Evenor for recommending nice latin music.

We definitely recommend O‚ÄôChallaghan collection.

See you again!!",5,2022,08,26
215,Great Place to Stay in Dublin!,"Would definitely recommend this Dublin hotel! It is in a great location, has a friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Didn't have time to try the restaurant for dinner, but the breakfast was very good. ",5,2022,08,25
215,Disappointing,"Booked 2 rooms one for me other  for my niece's.
Ordered a luxury platter as surprise for girls room. Extremely disappointed with shocking service had to get reception twice to try and get this. So annoying. While hotel is lovely and in a great location standard of service for the money is terrible. Not happy.",2,2022,08,23
215,Great stay,"Can really recommend the Alex hotel. The room has a lovely design and the beds are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Breakfast is lovely as well. A good selection and also alot of healthy options. 
There are plenty of bus stops to get you to the airport and you're right in the midst of dowtown. Everything is available within a couple minutes of walking. ",5,2022,08,23
215,Stylish and comfortable hotel attentive to all your needs,"I appreciated the thoughtful design of the rooms and common spaces,  which apart from being extremely stylish are also very comfortable to use (high quality materasses and pillows, good lighting, european outlet in the room,  comfortable seats,  etc.).  The staff is very friendly and attentive to your needs and breakfast is absolutely delicious,  with options for everyone,  regardless of dietery restrictions. I left the hotel feeling well rested and pumpered.  It's certainly not the cheapest place to stay,  but worth every penny :) ",5,2022,08,23
215,"Modern and fresh hotel, well located",Well located Dublin city hotel. It is clear that the interiors of the hotel have relatively recently received some investment and that d√©cor is very appealing. I stayed on business but the hotel is ideally located for tourists looking to explore Dublin. Rooms are bigger than average and very comfortable.  ,5,2022,08,18
215,Fab base to explore Dublin,"Loved the hotel‚Äôs location, decor and staff courtesy. Dinner was delicious - the handmade chips were unique and enviable. And the cocktails by @Marques were excellent - I recommend the Night of Passion (a cocktail, honestly!). We will be back!",5,2022,08,16
215,Nice and fresh hotell,"Really good hotel with nice big rooms. I liked the style. The breakfast had everything you could expert, would have like some vegetables though. The restaurant  was good but could have been more visible, hard to know that there was a restaurang.",5,2022,08,16
215,Terrible,"
The stay at your hotel did not fulfill our expectations of a four-star hotel. In particular, this concerns the use of the Executive Lounge ‚Äì Offering a large selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages as well as a variety of snacks according to your website. This promotion does not reflect reality. Compared with executive lounges in other hotels in Europe the guest did not approximately get a reasonable equivalent for the additional costs. We immediately complained this to the reception staff and asked for cancelling the executive lounge for the next days, later also per mail. With exception of a one-off special at our room - a nice touch, no subsequent improvement could be discovered. It is very unfortunate that the hotel did not accommodate our wish. 
Furthermore, we had also appreciated the information about the the construction site next door on the website. Early in the morning, the noise of the construction starts and affects sleep. 
These complaints made our stay very unpleasant at The Alex. 
Consequently, we will not recommend the hotel and rate it accordingly on booking.com.

215,Great hotel!,"I would definitely recommend this hotel! It is in an excellent part of town, surrounded by theater, great food and many of the prime sights. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We also loved the incredible decor and delicious restaurant. ",5,2022,08,11
215,Comfort and style in a well-located Dublin hotel.,"This is a hotel I will dream of returning to.  The breakfast was delicious, the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept iin, the pub next door never produced any late night whooping on the streets outside, the location is very central, and the hotel decor was smartly tasteful.  ",4,2022,08,08
215,"Nice hotel, some unfortunate issues","Overall nice, friendly staff and clean.  Malfunctioning fire alarms caused a 4:15 AM wake-up on last day.  Also room doors close with a loud slam.  Clearly audible several rooms away.  Breakfast nice, but nothing special.",3,2022,08,07
215,Excellent hotel in Dublin,The Alex is a wonderful hotel. Exceptionally clean and off the beaten path of Dublin busy traffic. Right around the corner from Pearce station and bus stops so you can get anywhere. Will stay here again for work and personal vacations. ,5,2022,08,02
215,Great Hotel and good location on the quieter side of town,"Great stay , Staff here are so friendly, the hotel is very stylish and location great about a 10 - 15mins walk into town, but plenty of good pubs and things to do in the area. Rooms are comfy and quiet.",5,2022,08,02
215,Do it! It is the right choice!,"Gorgeous style and its next to the city center. Excellent! The breakfast ist so lovely, you qill enjoy your full irish breakfast. Also the service really cares about you. 
The room is big and the bed is uncredible cozy, you'll sleep well there.",5,2022,08,02
215,Classy and Modern,We stayed 5 nights at The Alex and would book it again and again and again. The desk staff were helpful to answer questions and book taxis. Breakfast and bar staff were attentive and kind. The room was super clean and quiet. Likely the most comfortable bed away from home we've experienced. The location is close to the Pearse bus stop and the DART station. A quick walk to Trinity College and a only a bit more to Temple Bar and other busy spaces making this close to the fun but away from the noise and craziness.,5,2022,08,01
215,Lovely Hotel,"A great hotel on the edge of Dublin City centre.

Car parking - 2 mins walk away from the hotel in a secure car park through gates protected by key code and internal barriers.

Rooms - excellent. We needed interconnecting rooms for us and our children (of 11 & 13), easily arranged over email. 

Very spacious and well-appointed rooms with modern decoration. Beds were very comfortable to the extent we wanted to know the make of mattress they use!

Staff - very friendly and willing to help.

Location - very good, approx 10/15 mins walk to the main shopping streets.

We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel.

Highly recommended!",5,2022,08,01
215,Cute place,"Loved the interior design of the place, everything was well thought out and super cute to look at. Comfortable bed. Nice amenities. Parking right down the street. Enough to do around without it being too much. Very friendly staff. Would recommend if looking for a low key nice place to stay in Dublin. ",5,2022,07,31
215,The Alex in July 2022,"The hotel was very accommodating to us as the airline lost our luggage and we had very little the first night.

The staff was super nice from the front desk to the restaurant personnel . In particular Jose Guillermo was our Angel in the bar at night after some frustrating days dealing with our loss of luggage. He was very kind and professional and was a perfect representation of the hotel.",5,2022,07,26
215,A comfortable cocoon after a long night of international travel.,We stayed for two nights pre-cruise. The Alex Hotel was heaven and in a great walkable location.  The staff and service were terrific.  Beds were amazing!   Full included breakfast was great. Highly recommend.,5,2022,07,25
215,Incompetent staff and overpriced rooms,"It was clear from the start that the front desk were absolutely lost when it came to customer service. Even the senior people couldnt do their job. We had a voucher for 200 euro which meant we only needed to pay 80 euro for the night. Even after I asked the lady to take care of the voucher, she manged to lose it overnight! We only stayed one night. They were unable to produce a receipt for us on checkout. We should have insisted as what then ensued was a month of hassle. They took 400 euro from our account. It took a week of emailing and phonecalls before someone finally transferred the money back BUT we ended up paying the bank fee ! they also reserved 300 euro on our card. it took 1 month for the money to be released I do NOT recommend this hotel",2,2022,07,25
215,Fantastic hotel in Dublin,Stayed for a night trip to Dublin and loved this hotel. Everything from location which was an easy 10-15 min stroll to Grafton St/ Temple Bar/ St Stephen‚Äôs Green to the hotel decor. The room was super comfortable and well appointed with aircon and a king sized bed to die for. So much thought went into the decor and I loved it. Parking available in a secure car park 150m from hotel which was convenient. Would definitely stay again,5,2022,07,21
215,Overpriced for Andre Rieu Concert Week,"The room was nice but very small.  Bathroom lovely.  You check in at the bar of the hotel.  Not overly friendly staff.  And there is NO LIFT.

Our room would normally (if it was not Andre Rieu concert week) about ‚Ç¨105 but because we were there for the concert it was about ‚Ç¨340.",3,2022,07,20
215,The Only Place to Stay in Dublin,"While the service and cleanliness of the hotel are top notch, the best part was the design of the hotel.  Very retro but modern feel to everything.  The indirect lighting in the room made relaxing so easy.  Thank you!",5,2022,07,18
215,The comfiest bed and a warm welcome,"Enjoyed our stay in large room, big bathroom, huge comfortable bed and friendly, efficient staff. Walking distance to everything we wanted but a pretty quiet area too.  Would recommend and would use again. 10/10",5,2022,07,16
215,"Clean, Friendly, Convenient","We stayed here our last night in Dublin.  The staff was so friendly and made sure we were comfortable.  Room had two twins beds slid together, which was fine.  A/C which is rare in Ireland and much appreciated.  My husband and I ate in the hotel restaurant, but the grandkids didn't see anything the liked, so walked a short block to a great Italian place. Hotel called for our cab in the morning, one to accommodate my family of 5 adults. Pricey, but we were on vacation.  Would definitely recommend!",5,2022,07,14
215,Irish eyes not smiling,The property is cool and nice.  The staff were mostly untrained and unable to properly cater to guests. The property is clean and the location is good.  It is very near the DART train which enables easy access to nearby towns and villages.,3,2022,07,13
215,Comfortable but hot,"The hotel was clean and the room had chairs for relaxing. If they had been able to have my fourth floor room at a comfortable temperature, this would be a 5 star review. The temperature is my only complaint. To be fair, it was warmer than usual in Dublin that day.",4,2022,07,12
215,very pleasant stay,"The service from front desk, breakfast was excellent. The buffet breakfast offers a good selection of both hot and cold items. The location is easy access to all the attractions of Dublin. Car parking facilities at Alexender Court is a big plus (at a daily fee of EUro15). ",5,2022,07,10
215,Excellent stay at The Alex,"Lovely hotel close to everything a tourist would want but super quiet for sleeping. The room was very large, great bed, extremely clean room, and well-stocked. Since we were on the executive floor (6th floor), we had full access to the executive suite which was open from 7am-7pm. Our room key gave us access. Fully stocked, beer, wine, pop, juice, water, tonic, crisps, sweets, granola, coffee/tea station. All included. The breakfast buffet is wonderful and we were filled leaving there. Food at supper was excellent too. Recommending The Alex to everyone!",5,2022,07,10
215,Good hotel for short stay,"Rooms were clean and new. Hotel is perfect for business or short stay ... just meters from Merrion Park, Trinity and Grafton Street. Food was good and the staff were friendly. Perfect location to see the city ",4,2022,07,08
215,"Well done, ALEX!","We stayed at the ALEX for two nights to attend a concert in Trinity College Park. The location of the ALEX was of course ideally for this matter.
We had a great time at the ALEX and two wonderful days there. The room was spacious and very clean - worth to mention is the bathroom with an excellent shower. But really outstanding were the mattresses! We have not slept so good in any other hotel before - and not even at home. It seems the hotel does know this b/c we mentioned this when leaving the hotel and we have been told that these are King Koil mattresses handmade in Ireland. Seems some other guest have asked this before :-)

The service and breakfast was great and nothing to complain about at all. Overall I would highly recommend to stay there and we will come back for sure again.",5,2022,07,07
215,Good Hotel in Good Location,"After missing a day at this hotel because of an Aer Lingus cancellation, we arrived a day late. What a pity because this is a very nice hotel. We had two rooms and both of them were excellent. The breakfast was really great and the service fast and efficient.
We also had dinner one of the nights and the fish and chips were amazingly good as well as the Parmesan fries!! Wished we could have had our full time there. It was walking distance or many of Dublins main tourist sites and there is a pub next door. Kind of perfect.",4,2022,07,07
215,Wonderful stay in Dublin,"We greatly enjoyed The Alex Hotel for a three night stay in early July. Great location - easy to walk to all the sites.  Rooms were lovely, perfect for us and our teenage sons.. We really appreciated all of the help from staff at the front desk from dinner recommendations to help with a taxi. ",5,2022,07,05
215,Dublin Golf,"The Alex was great place to stay for a first time trip to Dublin.  The location was convenient and within easy walking distance to many museums and activities.  The breakfasts were great and they would make eggs to order.  Drinks were a little expensive, but its a hotel bar and you have several hundred pubs nearby.  Would definitely stay there again.  ",5,2022,07,05
215,Alex Hotel,"First visit to Dublin, family of three adults. Very comfortable hotel, stylish interiors, central location, could walk almost everywhere. Friendly helpful reception staff. Excellent restaurant. No complaints for this 4 star hotel.",4,2022,07,03
215,Hotel Resturant,"We had dinner at the Alex hotel tonight. Dinner was very good ! However, our waiter Marques was even better. He was very helpful and attentive. We had the steak which was cooked perfectly and a giant baked cookie for dessert which was amazing.  If you come to this Resturant, ask for Marques !",5,2022,07,02
215,Nice but silverfish issue!,"Hotel is beautiful, food is lovely and beds extremely comfortable. Bring ID and a physical credit/debit card to pay. There were silverfish in our en-suite which is not a nice thing to encounter. They‚Äôre harmless but unpleasant.  
We had a nice stay. Staff were friendly. ",3,2022,07,02
215,Exceeded every expectation,"The location makes touring Dublin on foot convenient since Trinity college, Grafton Street, the Temple bar area encounter with other museums and historic sites are within a 10-minute walk. The hotel staff is is incredibly attentive starting at check in with Paula Pepeine. I arrived well ahead of check-in time and and she took my mobile number so she could call me as soon as my room was ready which she did.  The restaurant wait staff was superb checking frequently to make sure that each diner had everything they needed. The rooms are modern, well appointed and incredibly comfortable. The food was delicious. I will be back.",5,2022,07,01
215,Just OK,The hotel itself is great - good location and very stylish interior. We were upgraded to a lovely big room which was a nice touch. However there were a few things we were disappointed with. The staff at front desk were lacking enthusiasm and were not very engaging. A friendly smile goes a long way. The staff in the restaurant were not on the ball and I even had a drink spilled down me. It was also a real shame for such a plush hotel to not have room service or even a stocked mini bar. Luckily we could use Deliveroo but it would have been much better for  the hotel to have offered room service. I went down to the restaurant to ask if I could order something to take up to our room but was told the food could only be consumed inside the restaurant. No idea why?! Overall we enjoyed our stay but there‚Äôs definitely room for improvement.,3,2022,07,01
215,Serious staff issues,"There was a serious issue with staff. It felt like they had temps in, who hadn't a clue - they looked like deer
caught in headlights. Went to the bar for a couple of drinks after the Eagles gig, and there was a 20 minute wait,
even though there were 4 bar staff and a small crowd of people. The manager just looked around and told the
other 3 what to do, without getting involved himself.
The glass of Prosecco I ordered was as flat as a pancake. Ordered another one, and same thing, so obviously
from the same bottle. I just gave up at this stage. We were a bit peckish and wanted a bar snack, but there was
not a crisp or a nut to be had. Was told by a barman that we should've got some snacks ourselves in the shop on
way back to hotel. Bar then closed super early - no residents bar.
Then in the morning at 8am we had housekeeping talking amongst themselves very loudly outside our door, and
knocking on all the room doors near us! Came to ours at 8.30am, knocking and shouting ""housekeeping!"". I nearly
hit the roof. 8.30am on a Saturday morning, away from the kids for a night and we'd that to deal with. Needless to
say I was up then for the day. Was this a ploy to get people up and out early??? Seemed like it, and it was
completely unacceptable.
Nice rooms and lovely location, but for ‚Ç¨245 per room (our friends had another room) plus dinner plus drinks, l'd
expect a better standard and I was seriously disappointed.",2,2022,06,28
215,Nicest hotel we stayed at in Ireland,Very nice hotel. Stylish rooms with super comfortable beds and pillows. Best breakfast of our entire week in Ireland where we stayed in numerous other hotels. Great location if visiting Trinity College. Some nice parks nearby too.,5,2022,06,27
215,The Alex Hotel,"Check in was easy, and the staff did its best to accommodate us and others with early check in. The room was clean and cozy! Ate the restaurant, and the food was great. Small menu but the staff goes beyond the normal to take care of your requests.",5,2022,06,26
215,Family trip,"I would rate this higher but our room was so hot and the air was not cooling. The hotel had no way to alleviate the temp. No fan, No fix.  Otherwise, staff was excellent.  We arrived super early from trans-Atlantic flight exhausted, planning to have to leave luggage until check-in.  They had our rooms ready.  This was a great way to start our trip and very appreciated.",4,2022,06,24
215,June 2022,"The best thing about the Alex hotel is its location. Otherwise, it is just average, but nothing to complain about. The decor is undistinguished, and the staff is minimal, with a range of prefessionalism.",4,2022,06,24
215,Fantastic stay,"We got an upgrade to the Suite, and it was just fabulous! Very large, fantastic bed and luxury bathroom. Personnel was all very kind. Breakfast was delicious. Location very good, We would really recommend this hotel to others.",5,2022,06,21
215,Fabulous hotel,"The Alex Dublin its amazing from rooms,restaurant to the events.

We had lunch in secret garden and experienced was more than perfect.Jonathan was very nice with us and food is amazing.

Day after we had meeting with company.Need to mention Patrick and Marco.This guys are really proffesional and in the same time funny and positive.Need ti say big thank you for all they‚Äôre help.

Can‚Äôt wait to be back in Alex hotel.",5,2022,06,21
215,"Basic Hotel, Centrally Located","The Alex sits on a quiet street just a short walk to Merrion Square, the National Gallery, Trinity College, and a variety of shops and restaurants. The rooms are comfortable, quiet, and basic. The hotel was chosen for me as part of a pre-cruise arrangement. I also stayed here the night after the cruise. 

My pre-cruise package included a breakfast buffet which was varied and tasty. The post-cruise did not. Those who stay in the hotel may purchase the buffet for 20‚Ç¨ or grab a lighter meal in the on-site cafe. 

The staff were pleasant but not particularly efficient at check-in. My second stay included a room on the executive floor. I visited the front desk twice to get a properly configured key so that I could gain entry to the lounge. 

The executive lounge is best set up for evening, as it is stocked with a variety of soft drinks, beer, and wine. The wine bottles were uncorked, partially drunk, and sitting on the counter. This surprised me as most beverage managers know that improperly stored wine oxidizes. I was looking forward to finding some juice in the lounge for morning, but the closest item was orange soda. I recommend not paying extra for the executive room unless you are traveling with a group and would like a quiet place to have a beer together in the evening.",4,2022,06,20
215,Lovely place and friendly people,"Had an absolutely lovely time at this hotel room, bed were nicely sized, very clean! Staff was lovely and friendly! Marqves in the dining room was so lovely, friendly and sweet! Would come here again!",5,2022,06,19
215,Mini break,"Stayed for 2 nights in June as a couple.  Used the hotel as a base to explore Dublin and go to a concert at Malahide Castle.  Great location. Very clean.  Would stay again.  Excellent value, especially as we were able to use Tesco Clubcard points to cover much of the cost, though hotels.uk",4,2022,06,17
215,Wish we‚Äôd stayed longer,Safe secure reasonably priced overnight parking in centre of Dublin. Really welcoming friendly staff very helpful advising us on travel to our concert venue. Room was really spacious with excellent facilities huge bed which was so comfortable and air conditioning which  we did need!! The restaurant was well laid out and the food really tasty I wanted something from the lunch menu which wasn‚Äôt on the dinner menu but they were more than happy to accommodate me. Breakfast was a real treat and the meal prices  very reasonable. Would highly recommend and will definitely be returning.,5,2022,06,16
215,Friendly,"Friendly staff and wait staff in the restaurant (thank you for your service, Gabriel). The junior sweet was cool. It could have been a little cleaner for my taste and I wish they had provided additional soap or body wash for showering/bathing. Otherwise, quite convenient location. Short walking distance from the National Gallery of Ireland, a highlight.",4,2022,06,16
215,Decent hotel but had some issues,"The Alex is a nice hotel on the surface, bed very comfortable, clean bedroom, reception, dining area etc. Nice shower in the bathroom. We did have some  issues with slow service in the bar. Food is only decent, beef taco starter is way over priced for two tiny, cold mouthfuls. Housekeeping came into our room at 8:20am, we were still asleep, a mistake that really shouldn‚Äôt happen. Our room was only barely ready at 3pm, despite when I checked in online in the days prior entering that we would arrive at 2 and receiving a reply email to say check in time 2 check out time 11. Not a major issue but considering check out time is 11am rooms should be ready by check in time. 
Overall we were glad we weren‚Äôt spending much time in the hotel, but it was nice just for the night. ",3,2022,06,14
215,"Great event, hotel and staff","We attended the ITM event at the Alex Hotel. The event itself was really educational and it was really valuable experience. The hosts and the speakers made the event pleasing. Shout out to the hotel staff, especially the manager Marco, Jack and Patrick who gave us warm welcome and enjoyable experience. Later on, the event continued at The Davenport hotel, which interior and design are amazing! Davenport staff was great as well.

Thank you O‚ÄôCallaghan Collection Team :)

215,Smart but not sharp,"Stayed 3 nights. Location is perfect...tucked away but close to center of town,  restaurants & attractions.  
Rooms are smart and well appointed. 
Service will be 3 stars. Especially house keeping.  Even basic essentials like bath mats,  towels,  toileteries etc are not replaced or kept in the room. You keep having to remind them to replace  sugar / milk etc. Else had no complaints. Breakfast was good. Would say it seemed like a smart no frills hotel but does not justify the price you pay. ",4,2022,06,09
215,VHI mini marathon afters,"Few of us met for a quick bite after the VH1 mini marathon that ended up fabulous. Our table assistant 
Marques was amazing, he turned up the heaters as we were all soaked from the rain. Food dammmm amazingüíØ",5,2022,06,08
215,Red eye flight stay,"Amazing trip! We loved the hotel. It was so homey and comforting. We had a red eye flight and needed sleep so bad, we paid for early check in & we got into our room as soon as we arrived. Thiago at the front desk was so helpful!",5,2022,06,08
215,Loved Everything About The Alex!,"I booked a private tour with My Ireland Tours so the choice of hotels was theirs, not ours.  We arrived in Dublin at 5am, explored the city with our driver for a few hours, and then he drove us to the hotel to see about an early check-in. It was around noon and the tiredness was starting to set in for us and a nap would have been perfect right about then.  One of our two rooms was ready so the four of us brought our luggage up to the room, which we found just perfect (though the smoky glass door to the bathroom was a bit weird since I was sharing the room with my brother). 

We stayed at The Alex two nights at the beginning of our trip and then again for the last night, 12 days later. The food was delicious, especially the breakfast, which was included. Loved the fresh yogurt with fruit, the mushrooms and tomatoes, and of course the brown bread, which is made from their own recipe. It was so good!  I highly recommend their sticky toffee pudding and the flan. To die for!

Everyone was very helpful and nice, especially Gareth. He went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. I would stay here again without hesitation. It's close to everything, yet quiet.",5,2022,06,07
215,Some loose ends,"Location wise this place is just outside the bustle of many tourist attractions but you can reach most of these spots quickly by walk. The hotel is trendy and stay was pleasant. However, housekeeping was a disaster. Towels, mats and coffee were not replenished despite reminder. Breakfast at the restaurant was smooth and the staff were friendly. For the price we paid, I was a little disappointed with the service.",3,2022,06,06
215,A great Stay,"We ha a great stay, the staff were lovely, the room was very clean, very modern, comfortable and the central location of the hotel enabled us to walk wherever we wanted to go so no taxis needed. Breakfast was included in the hotel price and there was a good selection of food available.",5,2022,06,06
215,Overnight in Dublin,"We had an overnight in Dublin after traveling the country for a week and prior to leaving for the Isle of Man.  After much travel, we enjoyed the comfort of our room, and were pleased to have an excellent dining experience at the hotel restaurant, The Carriage Restaurant.  We recommend the Parmesan truffle fries and the sirloin with chimichurri.  Our waiter, Aesop, was very attentive.  I booked the hotel based on proximity to other sights I wanted to see, but again, we were happy to stay in and rest after a busy week exploring Southern Ireland.",5,2022,06,05
215,Noisy and too hot,"No air conditioning, and it was very hot so found it difficult to sleep. My room was on the road and directly opposite building works which started from 0630 am so trucks and loud noise also prevented a comfortable stay. Service was inconsistent. No room service. Poor menu and food quality in restaurant for dinner. ",2,2022,06,04
215,Great service and food,"Went to The Alex this evening to meet some friends for a casual catch-up. 
Jonathan was looking after the dining area and was really friendly and accommodating‚Ä¶. and sorted out a really great spot for us to have as we wanted quiet space to catch-up. 
The food, service, value and selection was top notch.",5,2022,06,02
215,Lovely staying at Alex hotel,"Location of the hotel is perfect.We had lunch in the garden, it was amazing.Food was so delicious.Staff in the restaurant are very kind and approachable.
But i must mention two gentlemen Marco and Gareth who were amazing during our conference.They respond quickly to our every request.Very professional and polite.

It was very nice experience in the hotel.
I will definitely recommend.",5,2022,06,02
215,Shockingly bad management,A male cleaner let himself into my bedroom at 9am without knocking first as I was getting changed  - raised a complaint to reception but management couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to come discuss it with me. ,1,2022,06,02
215,Conference,"Excellent conference facilities for the first time back in person in over two years, cookies were delicious. Unfortunately some less than memorable experience in the bar afterwards, blonde member of the team quite dismissive to guests and other staff, not cut out for the people industry by the look of it. 

Would highly recommend the hotel and sister hotels overall just a few tweaks in the bar.",4,2022,06,01
215,Perfect stay,"Ideal location for walking everywhere in the city - we went to a concert in the 3 Arena. Perfect location. The breakfast was incredible and our room very comfortable, clean, and spacious. A great hotel. We will definitely stay again. ",5,2022,06,01
215,Our Stay at The Alex Hotel,We enjoyed The Alex Hotel.  We stayed the first night of our trip and then also the last night of our 10 day trip.  Good bar at night.  Great breakfast.  Our room was clean and big enough.  Would stay there again!,4,2022,05,30
215,Modern Hotel,"The Alex is a very modern hotel in a good walking location form all in Dublin.

Very spacious rooms focusing on style and attention to detail.

The downside was the limited evening menu, but overall a nice hotel.",4,2022,05,30
215,"Nice hotel,bad behavior from bartender","This is our second visit to the Alex Hotel.

  The first time we stayed was a very pleasant experience.  but other times not.  the rooms as always are comfortable and clean.  The staff at the reception is excellent. But the experience at the bar destroyed us.  Very bad behavior by the bartender Querrin.  First, she said that she doesn't make cocktails even though they have a cocktail menu. She treated her colleagues badly in front of the guests and said out loud that she would not serve anyone if somebody walked through the restaurant door.  

However for everything else all good things for Alex hotel but you should work on hiring a more professional staff.",3,2022,05,30
215,Nice Hotel,"This is a nice hotel, within walking distance (10-20 minutes) of all the main attractions in the city.  The rooms are high quality and very clean.  I would certainly stay here again. The breakfast is quite good for a continental breakfast offering.",4,2022,05,29
215,Positive experience,"We stayed at Davenport but our meetings were at Alex hotel. Rooms in Davenport are neat and clean the restaurant is very nicely decorated and the breakfast is rich in choice. Our meetings were held at the Alex hotel. I would special mention Gareth and Patryk who answered on our every question and who are very approachable. Thanks a lot to the manager Marco who provided us with quality service on a professional level.He was with us from start to finish.

I will definitely recommend both hotels and for sure we will be back.

Thank you and good luck!",5,2022,05,26
215,Lovely Hotel in Great Location,"The Alex provides a lovely accommodation in a very good location.  Many attractions are within easy walking distance. The staff are friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  The lobby has a nice restaurant/bar area and several seating options where you can relax and plan your next adventure.",4,2022,05,26
215,Just Amazing,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start . The service is excellent and very friendly, the food is so good and the room was so nice . This whole trip was so beautiful and we will stay at this Hotel again for sure .",5,2022,05,26
215,"easy, clean, nice","super comfortable bed and room, great price, great location, nice people every step of the way.
easy check in and check out, got a quick drink in the bar, had a great coffee and croissant at the coffee shop on the way out, they helped us get our airport cab which was perfect, super efficient check in and check out, all good.",5,2022,05,25
215,Quality Hotel downtown Dublin,Very comfortable room! It was great to cast shows from the cell phone onto the tv. Great bonus! Nice thick towels and delightful bath products. No washcloths as in most European countries so bought a nice sponge. Forgot to bring a washcloth from home. Ate quite a few breakfasts here. Very filling full Irish breakfast but wished they altered foods a bit each day. Porridge would be nice too. Excellent location close to Trinity College and many key Dublin sites. Dublin is quite a walkable city and The Alex Hotel is a great home base. Highly recommend!,5,2022,05,25
215,Great hotel with a really nice design,Great hotel with a nice design. Check-in was hassle-free and there's an online check-out so you don't have to wait in a queue. Food in the hotel restaurant is good but the waiting times can be a bit long.,5,2022,05,25
215,Weekend away,I would really recommend this hotel- it‚Äôs in a great location (walking distance to everything) and felt very safe. Beautifully presented room with a very comfortable bed and helpful staff. I Would recommend trying the Gingerman pub next door also. ,5,2022,05,23
215,Big hotel with nice employees doing their best with bad processes,"The staff was lovely but there was a lot of chaos for them to handle- no rooms were ready when we arrived. I‚Äôd recommend showing up later and enjoying the two hours we spent in the lobby elsewhere. Once checked in, showers/drains did not function and bathroom flooded immediately.",3,2022,05,23
215,"Poor customer service, not as advertised","We paid for a junior suite. Advertised with 24 hour room service and exec lounge.  No room service was available.  No lounge.  When we arrived this wasn't even explained to us.  I saw it on the page handed to us and asked. Was told it was due to staffing. Regardless of reason it should have been explained to us before arriving or at least on arrival.  Nobody apologised or contacted us in advance. No water in room. No effort made to persuade us to return. Staff were friendly but it is incredibly frustrating to see all of these extras Still advertised on the website when they aren't available. What is more frustrating still is that, when invited to leave feedback, I explained all of this and still no one has been in touch.  The only thing we got as an apology was a comp bottle of prosecco but they were going to charge us 48 euro for it.  I asked if they would at least comp it in thr circumstances to make up for the disappointment. Feeling very annoyed that we were charged full price for extras that were not available and that the Alex is still advertising this on thr website.  It's a real pity as rooms are nice but I am really surprised no one has made any effort to reach out to apologise.  I don't think we should have been charged full price for this.  We did not get what we paid for.  Would not return and would not recommend.",2,2022,05,22
215,Dublin spring,"Nice hotel close to Trinity colleague, nice and quiet area but still close to restaurants and sights. The staff was really helpful. The gym facilities looked great, but didn't have time to use them. The breakfast was good but would have liked a wider selection of cheese, ham and bread.",4,2022,05,21
215,"Fabtastic Service,Amazing Food","Our company organized an event at the Alex Hotel.  We spent the night over there and rooms were clean and tidy. Very good choice of breakfast food.Mary Kate is amazing.Very approachable and positive person with perfect service.

Many thanks to Marco,Patrick and Evenor for taking care for us on thed event.Their service was at a high level and very professional.Meeting rooms was set up perfectly. 
Mr. Marko even organized taxis and explained the routes around the city for us on our day off.

We will be definitely back to the Alex Hotel!",5,2022,05,20
215,Issue resolved,"Excellent hotel, but just wanted to give a shout-out to Gareth, who resolved an issue with understanding and grace. He is a credit to the hotel and the hospitality industry. If only all hotel staff were as good.",5,2022,05,19
215,The Alex in Dublin,"The Alex in Dublin is a great renovated hotel, provides great access to the hop on, hop off bus routes. As well, parking access a block away. The staff was amazing and friendly, and the breakfast was good as well. I‚Äôd recommend the Alex when staying in the center of Dublin city.",5,2022,05,17
215,Just correct. A lot to improve,"Nice deco but bad quality furniture. 
Not bussiness room.
Many issues to improve including service, food, clean, amenities, etc.
Good location close to the National Art Museum of Ireland, Trinity Collge and Grafton Street by walking distance",3,2022,05,17
215,"Great Location, Great Size Room","My sister and I had a double room.  Location was great, an easy walk into Grafton Street but away from the noise.  The room was way bigger than expected in a European hotel, with lots of space for us to spread out and with all our luggage.  Beds were VERY comfy, blackout curtains were great so we got a great sleep.  Two tiny quibbles (which would not stop me from staying there again): Hotel should offer hair conditioner with their toiletries, and there weren't enough towel hooks in the bathroom.",5,2022,05,16
215,Great spot for a weekend break,Great location for a weekend break. Most of the main attractions of Dublin within walking distance. The Alex is a nice clean business style hotel with great staff. Food and rooms are good. Would go there again,4,2022,05,16
215,Great Hotel!,"This hotel was fantastic!  We stayed 4 nights.  The room was lovely, clean, elegant and modern.  The staff was wonderful.  We spoke to a few of the young staff members.   Everyone was accommodating and so friendly, helpful.  The location is great for touring the city, we walked pretty much everywhere from the hotel.  The park is nearby, but it was also a quiet area, near Merrion Square.  I highly recommend this hotel for American tourists.",5,2022,05,15
215,Excellent place to stay!!,The Alex was a lovely place to decompress after a long flight. They accommodated my food allergies easily. Tutus was our dinner server and he went above and beyond for us!!  We would definitely stay again. Very clean and comfortable. ,5,2022,05,13
215,Refreshing Retro-Style Experience,"Clearly inspired by 1970‚Äôs airport lounges, this hotel is a genuine refreshing change from your usual fare. 
We were booked in to sister hotel, The Mont, situated across the road however she wasn‚Äôt reopened in time for our stay so we were transferred. 
Good welcome and swift check-in meant we got to our room without delay.
Room well equipped with all you needed. Superb Californian King bed‚Ä¶..just blissful. Silly uncomfortable occasional chair proved pointless to sit in. Huge TV! Loved it. 
Tiny bathroom but still, it did the job. 
We had access to the Executive Lounge which was pleasant.
Breakfast was exceptional! Make sure you book that in. 
Outstanding gym (at the Mont) which I used with gusto! 
We recommend The Alex. My only advice would be to change those hideous occasional chairs with a sofa :)
All the best people‚Ä¶.and thank you.",4,2022,05,11
215,4 Days Conference Stay,"It is not a suitable hotel for a conference, maybe only for weekend gateways for young people. 
Bed quality low, especially with the slit in the middle. Housekeeping is disgusting. There is no wheelchair, no room service. Coffee and tea quality is horrible. Food is below average. ",2,2022,05,09
215,Lovely hotel,"Hotel excellent, facilities good, though lack of in room bottled water and meagre toiletries spoiled an otherwise excellent stay. A little distanced from city centre but at 20 minutes stroll from st Stephen‚Äôs green easily walkable.",4,2022,05,09
215,Beyond expectations,"Our business company had a meeting booked in the Alex hotel.Everything went really well.we also stayed the night in the hotel, the rooms were neat and clean, the breakfast had plenty of food in the buffet. The location is handy as well close to the city center.Special thanks to Eoin,Marco and Patrick  for professional service, good communication and attitude! Thanks everyone, will be coming back for sure :)",5,2022,05,05
215,Good restaurant at Alex Hotel,"My husband and I enjoyed our dinner at this hotel‚Äôs restaurant. My Piri Piri Chicken tasted very good, as did his Fish and Chips. The zucchini was tasty, and had a hint of vinegar. The menu was limited but fine. The quiet music and relaxing ambiance were perfect after a long day of travel. Our server was helpful, friendly and willing to chat. This restaurant is available to guests of the Alex and at least one sister hotel, the Davenport. The restaurant is conveniently across the street from our hotel (the Davenport), and we may return.",4,2022,05,05
215,wish it was better,"We paid for breakfast included, but due to our early pickup, could not eat it. We were told that we could have two prepackaged breakfasts the next morning, but someone else took them. The towels are awful, smell like silly putty (unclear why) and left fuzz/residue everywhere. No conditioner provided. It could be better, wish it was better organized. ",3,2022,05,05
215,Lovely hotel,"The hotel decor is brilliant and feels very unique.Also the gym is really good as the breakfast buffet. The location is also brilliant. 

I do think that the reception staff could have been more helpful. I tried to amend the booking made through booking.com  which I could  not do via the website and I struggled to get any help",4,2022,05,05
215,Great service,Gabriel is an amazing waiter & a credit to the hotel. Just went for dinner at the Alex in the secret garden out the back. Lovely flowers and design. Great cocktails and good food.....character minimum,5,2022,05,04
215,Needs staff training,"I really wanted to love this hotel. I did love the room design and decor, the bed was massive. Despite noisy American tourists who can‚Äôt seem to speak at a reasonable level in the corridors, the place was clean and tidy and very modern. 

Unfortunately it was let down by a lot of the staff. On check in, the lady was short and rude. She couldn‚Äôt give me any info on the car park except there was a discount for hotel guests. I didn‚Äôt care, I just wanted an idea of price and she didn‚Äôt know, then told me she was new so I left it there. FYI, the car park has nothing to do with the hotel, as the second lady constantly advised me. 

That afternoon I asked a different lady at reception and instead of having a calm chat and answering my questions, she demanded to know who told me there was a discount. She seemed more interested in arguing than just giving information so we could get on with the day. 
 
At breakfast, we were ignored waiting to go in and stood there for ages, to the point where a lady that was cleaning (Alina I think it was), dropped her mop and showed us to a table. She even made my partner a coffee, while the actual wait staff continued to ignore us, I couldn‚Äôt get anything. 
The process was just frustrating as hell and I didn‚Äôt want to ask more questions of reception, despite needing our bags stored
Alina and the man who checked us out this morning were lovely, everyone else‚Äôs attitude has ensured I would stay elsewhere next time.",3,2022,05,03
215,The Best Hotel and Staff in Dublin,"The staff is what sets this hotel apart.  From the wait staff, the reception staff and even the smiling leaning lady, every single person went out of his or her way to be friendly and accommodating. Every person had a story to tell and a way to be of assistance.  We so enjoyed meeting them and interacting with them.  The hotel is lovely and modern and very comfortable, but the staff is why this is such an outstanding hotel.",5,2022,04,29
215,"Great customer service, clean room and hotel, good food.","We stayed there for two nights and they were very accomodating as we arrived at 7:00AM in the morning.  They secured our bags since our room was not ready, and provided breakfast (even though technically we hadn't checked in).  It was within walking distance to the main area for shopping and tourist destinations.  Trinity College very close and not far from pharmacy and small grocer.  Staff very pleasant, bed comfy, hookups for all cell phone and tablets, etc.",5,2022,04,25
215,"Cool design, very friendly staff","Our stay was a very nice experience from A to Z. The hotel is very stylish, the people are very kind and helpful. The executive room offer with free drinks and snacks is also a positive thing I have to mention. We definitely consider coming back if we plan another trip to Dublin.",5,2022,04,25
215,Great stay at The Alex,"Loved this property and it's easy access to everything within walking distance. The staff are friendly and the breakfast each morning is delicious! It's a boutique hotel with lots of character and really clean, stylish rooms.",5,2022,04,24
215,Amazing Hotel! Absolutely fantastic staff!!! 100% would come back,"We had the most amazing time at The Alex! All of the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and super lovely to deal with. 

Two in particular were Chris and Cyril. They looked after us when we got back late in the night. They were attentive, went and turned the heat on my room. Got us plates and sides for food. Honestly went the extra mile and really made the trip for us!!

Amazing human beings and excellent experience from check in to check out!",5,2022,04,22
215,Generally loevely stay,"Friendly staff, nice hotel, comfortable room. 
One small (easily rectificable) thing had a negative impact on my stay and its a shame. For some reason no water in room and was never delivered, fine if a one off but I stay here regularly and it has happened before.",4,2022,04,22
215,Perfect Stay,Stayed here for a weekend break and the hotel was excellent. The room was spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The shower was also fabulous. I did not eat at the hotel so can‚Äôt comment on that but I did use the gym and it had everything you could have asked for in a gym. ,5,2022,04,18
215,Modern hotel with a great central location,"Stayed for 3-4 nights over Easter weekend. Hotel has been furnished to a high / chic design, with absolutely enormous beds! Great central location from which to see Dublin. Staff were very attentive and helpful

The room did seem to overheat slightly, with the airconditioning not making an impact. Given this was in April, I can imagine this may cause increased problems in Summer - especially as the great appeal of the central location / vibrancy of Dublin means you won‚Äôt really want your window open while trying to slee",4,2022,04,18
215,Extras for perfection!,"Neat, clean and secure.  Needs to add wash clothes and a modern phone to bedside table.  Also would keep the bar open longer.  Thanks to staff for going out of their way to make my stay a pleasant one.  Bravo!!!",4,2022,04,18
215,"Efficient friendly service, great breakfast buffet","Front desk staff were efficient and friendly.  The breakfast buffet has a nice selection of hot, fresh and tasty options. The hotel is in a good location, a short walk from Trinity College, shopping areas and lots of transport options. The room was a generous size, nice modern shower room. My only quibble was a slightly wonky curtain and there were coffee pods but no coffee machine in the room. Overall great experience and I would definitely recommend.",5,2022,04,14
215,Great stay,"My first time in Dublin and what a welcome. The team are great and really helpful. The rooms are perfect for a city break, bigger than London rooms!. Garrath helped us with a load of suggestions for things to do, restaurants and bars. 

We will be back 

Keep it up

215,Highly recommend,"I highly recommend this hotel. The service was excellent, rooms clean, comfortable and quiet. In walking distance to everything. We stayed 8 nights while in Dublin and only got a taxi to and from the airport. Food was delicious. Staff are so helpful. We especially want to acknowledge Chris at the front desk and Gabriel from room service. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Excellent service!",5,2022,04,09
215,Not impressed,"Great food, delicious coffee at Coffee Shop made by lovely Polish barista. Room OK but I can't say everything was as I expected. I was bit dissapoined, not happy that I had waiting for food so long. I had a strong impression too, something goes wrong with organisation there.",3,2022,04,09
215,Excellent hotel in a prime location,"The Alex Suite was very well appointed with a large bedroom, very large sitting area and an alcove with a rollaway for our daughter. The bathroom contained both a walk in shower and tub. The Alex staff was very friendly and helpful. The location next to Trinity College was within walking distance of everything we wanted to see.",5,2022,04,06
215,Excellent work Meeting Team!,"My company had an event hosted by The Alex Hotel Team in March this year. I just have to say - excellent job team, well done! Overall, our organiser, my team member, manager, everyone was so satisfied. The set up, communication, food, service, everything was 5 star. Even tough everyone was so approachable, I have to highlight the superb work of Meetings Team - Mr. Marco and Mr. Patrick. They were the only ones who were there from the beginning of our event, till the end of it. And in between, their service, approach and communication was just exceptional. Also, they stood longer then they had to, as our meeting was extended a bit. 
Great job everyone, looking forward to next event in the Alex, hopefully I‚Äôll have an opportunity to stay in the hotel for fews days as well.
Regards,
Luca",5,2022,04,06
215,"Lovely, modern hotel in a great location","Lovely modern hotel, beautiful and comfortable bedroom. Dinner was delicious as was the nonalcoholic cocktails. Breakfast had a great choice of different foods. I‚Äôd happily stay again and recommend this hotel. ",5,2022,04,05
215,Best service,"I was just in The Alex a few days ago. I can‚Äôt forget the waiter, Junior, who provided us with all of the necessary assistance, it was a difficult encounter. He's a Brazilian guy with a great smile, and practically all of the bartenders appear to be Brazilians. The garden is the best part of the restaurant; it can be cold or warm at times, but the staff are always there to help us. The food and drink were chilly at the start of our adventure, but as we progressed, things improved. The waiter and his colleagues assisted us and presented us with a gift because the bad beginner. In general the food and drinks became better than before and the service was overwhelming. (He always asked for apologize and was so friendly).
By the way, Junior, your English is amazing. Don‚Äôt be sorry never. I am so grateful  to hear about your life in Ireland.
If would I be back? 
Depends if I would have the same quality of service.",4,2022,04,04
215,Excellent service,"The staff at The Alex Hotel truly wanted to please us.  We stayed for two nights.  One night was a Sunday and many places in Dublin are closed on Sunday evenings.  Well, we finished some amazing tours and then we looked for a restaurant for dinner.  Couldn‚Äôt find any beyond the Temple Bar area which is extremely touristy.  So my fianc√© and I decided to eat dinner at our hotel, The Alex Hotel.  We didn‚Äôt expect much.  However, we sat down and Gabriel was our waiter and Luc was his assistant.  They made us feel special; very concerned about our every want and need.  The food was unexpectedly fabulous.  I had the steak and my fianc√© had a chicken Caesar salad.  The drinks were good too and the atmosphere is very nice.  
       We couldn‚Äôt eat dessert.  But Gabriel came to us with two cards.  We didn‚Äôt know what they were.  He said, ‚Äúchoose one‚Äù.  
        So my fianc√© picked a card and it read, ‚Äú[H]appiness is the only thing that multiplies when you share it.‚Äù
                 Albert Schweitzer 

        I would recommend this hotel restaurant even if major non-hotel restaurants are open.  You will love the quality of the food, the staff, the price, and the convenience!!!!

215,The craic was mighty,"We checked in at 1 a.m due to a cancelled ferry but the night team, Gareth and Chris couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. So great was the conversation that I eventually wandered off to bed at 3.10 a.m leaving the lads to deal with a large group of very drunk Americans, the second group while I was in attendance. The lads worked hard to ensure everyone was well looked after , going well beyond their brief and I look forward to my return there in a month. We only stayed one night so didn‚Äôt use the restaurant but the room was nice and the bed really comfortable.",5,2022,04,01
215,Great Stay,"Hotel staff was very welcoming, they are what made this stay so memorable. They make you feel at home. Rooms are big, very clean, the beds are so soft. Breakfast was top notch! Location of this hotel is perfect. You can not go wrong when you book this hotel. Defiantly will come back and defiantly recommend this hotel. ",5,2022,04,01
215,"Location, style, excellent personnel","Very pleased with my stay here and would stay again. The staff are particularly helpful, kind, and efficient (shout out to waiter Gabriel for his excellent service). I've had some early mornings, and the front desk staff have helped me arrange breakfast nevertheless. There is always a mini op√©ra pastry waiting for me when I get back in the evening. The location is close to everything! The style is a kind of mid-century, masculine design with lots of comfort and very relaxing lighting accents. No noises to worry about! Great sleep!",5,2022,03,31
215,Perfect Dublin Base,"The hotel was what I expected from the reviews and articles.  Very nice rooms, modern decor, chic, and very well located.  Nevertheless, what made it truly memorable was the kind, friendly and very efficient staff.  They turned a very good stay into a great one.  Thank you Carolina, Omri and Liselotte!  You are the best!",5,2022,03,30
215,Checked into already occupied room,"We booked the Alex for the night to attend a concert at 3arena. Upon arriving at check in we were greeted by two members of staff bickering and distracted. After entering room 102 we discovered it was already occupied. Something I have never experienced in many years of travelling, and a serious breach of security and privacy. After finally being given the correct room card (120), we proceeded to the room and immediately locked the door just incase. Room was beautiful. Good selection of tea and coffee making facilities. The bed was quite simply the best I‚Äôve ever slept in, we didn‚Äôt want to leave it. So comfortable. Rainforest shower was also excellent. Unfortunately, room could have been cleaner. Area behind bed was extremely dusty. Towels smelt funny and couldn‚Äôt be used. Also, the radio had no power cord. All in all a very mixed experience.",2,2022,03,29
215,The Secret Garden @ The Alex Hotel,"The ambience of the hotel, the staff, the food is mind blowing. The waiter Gabriel was very friendly and provided us with the best table. Thank you for your service Gabriel. The floral layout of the secret garden was very mesmerizing. The authentic food with cocktails were mouthwatering.",5,2022,03,28
215,Beautiful Hotel,Very friendly and helpful staff. Very clean and tidy. Good breakfast! The hotel is centrally located. You can many hotspots be reached on foot. Within 10 minutes. We will definitely book the hotel again. And we are happy to recommend the hotel to others. ,5,2022,03,28
215,Great Dublin accom,"Lovely place to stay for a few days in Dublin. Was in town on a business trip. Super central location - can walk everywhere you'd want to go. Despite the central location, the rooms are incredibly quiet! Staff very welcoming & helpful. Super comfortable beds..  ",5,2022,03,27
215,Excellent customer service,"I am in Dublin for a week at a time for work so I spend quite a few meals at the hotel restaurant. The food is tasty but the service of a regular waiter, Gabriel, really made the meals even better. Even though he is new from Brazil, his energy and positive attitude was super appreciated. I was really happy when he was serving me as he would give me some suggestions on food or drink, ask me how my day was and throw some friendly jokes my way. Big thanks to Gabriel for making a work trip feel less robotic.",5,2022,03,27
215,Modern hotel in a great location,"Modern, excellent location. Hotel provides a great central location from which to see the city. Very comfortable bed. Modern and clean bathroom. Fully appointed coffee dock.

It‚Äôs in a great area with restaurants, bars and shops near by.
I would recommend this hotel.
The linen was changed daily and the toiletries replenished.",5,2022,03,27
215,Great location,"Excellent location, very nicely decorated, good gym nearby and useful co-working space in the lobby. Has the potential to be a top hotel, but I felt like it was missing the little extra touches that other hotels at this price bracket offer. Would stay again but hope they add privacy screens/blinds to the rooms, and fix the temperature of the showers, which were luke warm.",4,2022,03,24
215,Great stay,"We stayed in The Alex for one night, visiting Dublin for the Ireland v Scotland match. The hotel was ideally located, a 20 minute walk to The Aviva Stadium and 10/15 minutes walk to Grafton Street. We arrived two hours before check in time hoping to leave our bags in left luggage, however our room was ready, so we were able to relax in our room for a while before heading out. Our room was spotless, tea, coffee and water were available. The bed was very comfortable and the rain shower in the bathroom was great. Next morning, breakfast was delicious, eggs cooked to order, well done, lovely runny poached eggs. Staff at reception were friendly and courteous. Overall we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2022,03,21
215,Fantastic Stay in The Alex Suite,"I couldn't fault anything about my stay at The Alex Hotel.

I arrived from the airport before noon, and the room was ready. Check-in was quick, and the room was fantastic.

I booked the Eat, Sleep and Reconnect Package, which included a 2-course meal in the Carriage Restaurant with a glass of wine or beer.

The Package included breakfast and access to the executive lounge. Although the lounge was open, you couldn't relax in the lounge, but you could take drinks and snacks back to the room.

The hotel was only a short walk to the city centre and in a quiet location.

Great hotel and a must stay if you are visiting Dublin.",5,2022,03,21
215,MUST STAY,"super clean, amazingly soft bed (i wanted to stay in my room all day), very nice staff with super easy check in and out process + called me a cab to the airport, staff will accommodate any needs, breakfast was delicious, i wish i booked a longer stay because it was that awesome",5,2022,03,21
215,Luc - Ace from the Netherlands!,We really enjoyed our trip to The Alex We were checked in by Eoin - very friendly and  polite gentleman. The rooms were spotless and comfy. Luc really took great care of us when dining! Garth the night manager was so polite and friendly! Thank u!!,5,2022,03,21
215,Scotland game,"Plus side : Great location proximity to the city St Stephens  Green , Grafton Street etc. friendly staff , great bed , nice breakfast .
Minus side: Dirtiest windows I‚Äôve even seen in a hotel , are all the Dublin window cleaners on strike ? 
No toilet brush in the bathroom . I really didn‚Äôt want to treat my other half to the results of a long day on the Guinness. I hear Dunnes sell them for ‚Ç¨4 , come  on Alex Hotel buy a few and put them in the bathrooms !
But overall a good experience and I would stay again .",4,2022,03,20
215,Nice place to be hosted,"Fantastic support from Pedro,  always very helpful and kind.  Thanks for letting us feel like at home. The meal and the environment also very good. Clase to the Centre and the Aviva stadium for attending a good rugby match",5,2022,03,20
215,Nice room but that's where it ends,"We booked the Alex hotel for my 40th birthday celebration.   It was the first time my husband and I had been away without our kids in 5 years and we were so looking forward to it.  We got the basic room but it was not cheap. ‚Ç¨380 for the night with breakfast. We paid an extra ‚Ç¨30 for late check out which allowed us only to stay til midday.  
The positives:  the room is decorated nice I liked the style.  The bed was nice and big and very comfortable. 

The negatives:  on arrival in the room I found a sanitary towel wrapper on the floor in the bathroom.  This was a little off putting. 
We went downstairs to have a pre dinner drink.  The hotel bar / restaurant lacked atmosphere.  The upholstery was dirty on the chairs and the furniture in general in common areas looked tired stained and marked.  We took the drinks up to our room instead then headed out of the hotel for dinner elsewhere.  
The next morning we went down for breakfast. The restaurant was fairly empty but we were stil seated at a table that's chairs were covered in huge stains.  I had to wipe food off my chair before I sat down.   The service was brief and curt to offer tea/ coffee and tell us breakfast was self service.  The tea was watery.  The hot breakfast was very poor.  No egg option apart from runny scrambled eggs .  Sliced pan  bread and carton concentrate orange juice.   It was of a very poor standard .  We just wanted to go and checked out early despite paying for later.  The car park is across the street not on site.  My husband thought this was included in the price but on leaving we were told it was an extra ‚Ç¨15.  We weren't even asked at checkout did we enjoy our stay I don't think she cared.  

Maybe for some this hotel would be adequate but for the price and the so called 4 star rating we found it over all below bar and I wouldn't stay again.  It spoiled part of my birthday celebrations  . ",2,2022,03,19
215,Really pleasant stay and staff,"Earlier this month, I attended the business meeting with one of my companies in the Alex Hotel. The overall stay was really pleasant. My partner and myself stayed overnight and had a breakfast in the hotel next morning. We had LOADS of inquiries about the hotel and the business, which all of these were answered very professionally and detailed by Patrick and Marco. Have to point out that as we were very impressed by their knowledge about everything! We received excellent breakfast service by Kevin as well. Overall, really pleasant stay and I‚Äôm looking forward for my company to organise an event in Dublin once again! Regards",5,2022,03,15
215,Bed and brunch stay,"We stayed here as part of the bed and brunch package. The night receptionist was lovely and a massive thank you to Gareth Forde for setting up our extra bed at 2am. We were having a lovely stay until brunch on Sunday at 12pm where it took 35 minutes for our order to be taken, we had been seated for 1 hour by the time our food arrived and one of the orders was incorrect( a breakfast burrito with half the ingredients missing) and had to be sent back. Overall the reception team/the room were brilliant but the brunch restaurant really disappointed us. It wasn't busy when we were seated so do not understand why it took 1 hour to receive our food. We then were told the burrito had been taken off the bill but we had to pay for sides we ordered, which made no sense as the burrito was included and already paid for as part of the bed and brunch package. A lovely hotel /restaurant but very disappointing service for the brunch.",3,2022,03,14
215,Beautiful hotel.,First time at the Alex. Beautifully decorated and very modern. Everything was spotless. Beds are so comfortable. The staff were very helpful. If you don‚Äôt mind staying just out of centre it is perfect. Definitely will be back,5,2022,03,14
215,Great spot!,"Overall lovely place. Everyone was super nice and helpful and the hotel was cute. They were more than accommodating and hotel is in walking distance to a lot of things. If it wasn‚Äôt, they called a taxi for you and made the whole process so easy. The only thing I would mention is that our room was a little hot, even in March, and the AC wasn‚Äôt exactly powerful. Otherwise, we had an amazing time.",5,2022,03,13
215,Great place to stay,"Great stay, and I would highly recommend to others. Close to the city center and the rooms are very comfortable and clean. The staff is friendly and always happy to help. The breakfast was good and the restaurant staff was also very friendly.",5,2022,03,12
215,Exceptional,"The staff are amazing! They are so, so helpful at all times and made us feel really welcome and comfortable. The bed was the comfiest hotel bed I have ever slept in.

215,Warm and welcoming stay,What a lovely hotel! Great location to walk anywhere or grab a cab. Friendliest staff around and it smells amazing! Very clean rooms. The restaurant and bar area are really nice to hang out in! Not too busy and the quietest hotel I‚Äôve ever been to. Beds are super comfortable. Great big bath towels and loved the big window. ,5,2022,03,07
215,Excellent,"Ambience amazing in this modern, clean hotel with welcoming, friendly staff who appear to enjoy working here. Evening meal close to hotel as recommended. Hotel dining appeared quiet. Breakfast average but dining area very relaxing,clean and modern. Covid stations in place. 10/10",4,2022,03,07
215,Very disappointing,"We stayed there for 11 nights  in July/August 2021. The hotel overcharged us, but on discovering it promised us that next time we visit Dublin we would be provided with one night free of charge. Upon attempting to book to stay again the hotel failed to keep to its promise. Most un-Irish; hugely disappointing",1,2022,03,02
215,Great Stay,"All you could want in a hotel, most comfortable bed, fantastic breakfast and staff are all welcoming and friendly.  The location is great for visiting any part of Dublin all within walking distance.  A great place to stay.",5,2022,03,01
215,Exceptional staff,"I stayed two nights at the Alex and very professional, efficient and helpful staff throughout the whole experience.

215,Could not recommend highly enough,"Decor of the hotel is out of this world, staff were amazing and knew it was my birthday and had special nice touches in the room for my arrival. Brilliant location, close to bars, restaurant, bord gais & st stephens green",5,2022,02,28
215,Super chic and modern,"The Alex was a perfect place to stay for a long weekend in Dublin. The location is perfect for exploring the city and you can walk to most attractions easily. It is also very close to the train ( which we took to Howth for the day). The coffee shop, restaurant and bar at excellent and we had the included breakfast every morning which had many choices and everything was fresh and delicious. We would have  our own happy hour at the bar before heading out to some amazing restaurants in the city all of the evenings we were there - great cocktails ! I will always recommend this place and def stay there in the future. It‚Äôs beautiful , affordable , clean and the concierge is very helpful. You won‚Äôt be disappointed !",5,2022,02,27
215,Great spot,"Booked The Alex for a recent business trip, and it was a great experience. Very comfortable bed and old world chic decor were a plus. The location is also very convenient; it was a 15 minute walk to the office by the river and 10 minute walk to good site seeing. ",5,2022,02,26
215,Great Stay Can't Wait to go Again!,Free Chocolate on arrival!! Room layouted so well and the Bed was so comfortable! The shower was spacious and the free shampoo and body wash was top quality. Staff were so welcoming and very helpful! One night we asked for a toothbrush and the porter had no problem running it up to us! Dinner in the hotel is also 5 star! Can't wait to go again! ,5,2022,02,24
215,Doesn‚Äôt feel like 4 stars hotel!,Food is amazing and service is awful. Housekeeping did not come to our room to tidy up. Staff used their master key to access our room without notice when we were sleeping. Should be more professional and better service. Very disappointed it ,3,2022,02,22
215,Business Trip,"Good hotel, plenty of staff to make you feel welcome.  Rooms are a good size with everything you expect from a city hotel. This is now my preferred choice when staying in Dublin for business when comparing like for like hotels.  ",5,2022,02,17
215,Excellent,"Omri at the front desk was extremely helpful and serviceminded. Always smiling, nothing was too much to ask! Clean hotel, large rooms, fresh carpets. Near to shopping, pubs, restaurants yet quiet at night as the hotel is tucked away on a quiet, small street. The staff in the restaurant was also very polite, chatty and serviceminded, very good at making you feel at home! Recommended!",5,2022,02,13
215,Overnight stay.,"We had a lovely overnight stay in the Alex last night. The manager Eoghin was so welcoming, the bedroom was gorgeous and we felt very safe there with extra security in the lifts. This is a fabulous hotel we will definitely be back.",5,2022,02,12
215,Amazing stay,"We had such a great stay for a friends 30th birthday. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. We were able to check in before 9am as soon as we arrived in Dublin, and the hotel gave us lots of recommendations of where to visit. Rooms were clean, comfortable and looked amazing. We had brunch in the restaurant and the food and cocktails were delicious. Location was ideal and it was easy to walk to many of the places we wanted to visit. Although the price was quite expensive for a two night stay, you got what you paid for. Would definitely stay again!",5,2022,02,07
215,Outstanding service - thank you!,"I've been to the Alexander a good few times, as the food is delicious, the atmosphere is lovely and service top-class.

I'm prompted to leave this review now as the the staff recently went over and above to help me when I left my wallet behind after picking up a coffee. Omri and Eoin spotted my staff card, and went to the trouble of finding my email address and contacting me to let me know they had found it. I am so grateful that they went the extra mile to help me out! Thanks so much to you both! :)

215,"Super, super staff","This is a great hotel in a super location with excellent friendly staff.  Obviously management is good.  It is a wee bit tired in places (carpet to basement, chairs in reception) and the dinner offering is no match for the wonderful delicious breakfast.  I normally eye roll at a buffet breakfast but it is really terrific here.  Housekeeping is excellent and our room was generous but golly gosh who carved up the space for the bathroom?  It is tiny.  Why?  There is so much space.  I don't understand it.  Nevertheless, we would definitely stay here again for the staff, the cleanliness and the location.  Highly recommend.",4,2022,01,24
215,Central and modern,"Great central location, rooms are a great size and the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.

215,One of Dublin's finest,"The Alex staff providing an amazing service whilst we were there albeit for two days only.

The food served was great and the drinks (alcoholic, fruit juices and teas alike) were exceptional.

Like all great hotels, there was a real sense of quality throughout. The rooms were brilliant too.

An added bonus of an unbelievable scent throughout the hotel too which was divine.

Will absolutely be going back.",5,2022,01,13

215,If carlsberg did staff!,"We stayed in The Alex on 8.1.22 and it was super. The room (the Alex suite) was fab and overall we really enjoyed our stay, but I have to say the hotel staff are a real credit to this hotel. Omri was just superb and nothing was a problem and the food and drink top notch. We will definitely go back and thank you for looking after us so well, we had a blast.",5,2022,01,09
215,"Calm, cool and sublime",We had an extraordinary stay at the Alex Hotel to conclude our tour of Ireland and cannot sat enough about the attentiveness of the staff and perfection of the hotel.  Very cool design aesthetic and perfection at every turn.  ,5,2022,01,04
215,30th Birthday Celebration,"I had booked a king room to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with two of our friends. Staff at reception left a cute birthday note and little cakes in the room - lovely!

We returned to the hotel bar for drinks after the birthday dinner and were served by Eric, he was friendly and took great care of us! We ordered multiple cocktails and ended up requesting starters for bites at 10pm - they were brought to us piping hot! 

Back in the room we had a leak in the plumbing under the sink, that we didn't notice until I woke up in the middle of the night. It drenched my clothes and the towels on the rack, I phoned reception at 4am I think, and Gareth came straight away with fresh towels and key cards to a new room. He collected my clothes for drying, Lucia then had it fresh and ready and dropped them back to our room in time for breakfast.

Overall fantastic experience, we had a great stay, breakfast the following morning was delicious too.

I don't have enough words to describe the professionalism and hospitality shown by all Eric, Gareth and Lucia. COVID guidelines were enforced and respected. We were able to have a memorable evening and safe stay.

100% will return again!",5,2022,01,03
215,Gem in Dublin City ‚ù§,"My friend and I enjoyed two night in this amazing hotel. Everything is just as in the website pictures. Room was spacious and spotless, beds felt like sleeping on clouds.

215,Disappointing‚Ä¶,"Was expecting a lot more for this hotel given the reviews.
I‚Äôll start with positives- We were kindly greeted by receptionist and upgraded to an executive room which we were delighted with. I had contemplated paying an additional ‚Ç¨70 myself to upgrade, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt as the room, for what it was, was totally overpriced. Location is ideal- 5/10 minute walk from Grafton Street.
The hotel lacked both character and atmosphere. I was also disappointed with the restaurant, it‚Äôs outdoors, which I didn‚Äôt realise, and quite small. Food was only ok. 
Breakfast was a total disaster which was down to poor management of staff. I had to ask twice for milk, I was constantly waiting for the buffet to be topped up and waiter also forgot to bring out our tea which I again had to ask for 2/3 times. 
Unfortunately, I won‚Äôt be staying in this hotel again.",3,2021,12,20
215,Excellent,"Myself and my partner stayed on Saturday 18th December and had an amzing stay. We could not fault the hotel or staff in any way.

Location of the hotel is so convenient.

Every team member we came across from check in to check out were extremely welcoming and helpful!

We had dinner in the secret garden on the night. Food and setting were both excellent.

We look forward to returning again in the future!

215,"FLO‚Äôs trip to Dublin, Ireland üáÆüá™","I am so grateful for the amazing hospitality the entire staff gave me. Lucia, Lucas & Omri made my stay very special. ü•∞ my stay was only suppose  to be 6 days but it was extended to 10days. With the staff‚Äôs help it felt like home away from home. üôèü•∞ I am so blessed the staff during my stay. Not to mention the hotel is absolutely beautiful and clean.

Had a great evening and look forward to returning soon.",5,2021,12,14
215,High quality service!,"We had dinner in this hotel as it was our last night in Dublin, sadly.  The food was good (we were there for dinner) but the service was better. We wanted advice on red wine, as we are not experts. A young waitress  (we think her name was Melina) helped us make a great selection from her recommendations of red wine.  She made sure that everything was OK for us a number of times. We appreciated this! The food was good too, which is surprising considering how busy the place was. Highly recommended for friendly staff.",5,2021,12,14
215,Humanity as Hospitality,"The staff at The Alex Hotel can sweep you up in their sincerity and remind you (even amidst social distancing) you are in good hands. A little place where kindness is in such abundance, you can‚Äôt help but be your best self. Thanks Gareth, Chris, and Omri for the reminder on why hospitality amongst ourselves and all people are of the utmost importance. Attention to detail throughout the day and night, the hotel operates like an orchestra. A stay here isn‚Äôt just a vacation through harsh business travel, but an is oasis training in how sweetness and gentle temperament is a virtue.",5,2021,12,14
215,"All good, great service","A few days ago my friend and I had lunch at The Alex in the secret garden. I was delighted in every aspect of service, I will be back to Alex for sure, and I‚Äôm going to recommend that place. Such amazing food, sophisticated space, and, first of all, great staff! Especially I would like to thank one of the waitresses (called Milena,but I'm not sure. Based on her accent I guess she's from Eastern Europe). I will never forget her politeness, charm, and I will keep in my mind our short but so interesting conversation. She just made my day. I fully recommend The Alex.",4,2021,12,13
215,Couldn't have been better,"Everything was fantastic - hotel decor, staff friendliness and efficiency, room size, location of the hotel, value for money. Couldnt have been any better. We had a junior suite and use of the executive lounge was a real perk.",5,2021,12,13
215,Christmas in the City,I really loved this hotel. The location was excellent and the staff were so nice and friendly but the very best thing of all was the cleanliness. Excellent. It was my first time visiting this hotel but I certainly don‚Äôt think it will be my last. Well done to everyone ,5,2021,12,13
215,Fab staff,"Food was lovely but the staff made this place. In particular Petra who we had a great laugh with. She was fab! Another lady who served us desert but I forgot her name, sorry. Lovely setting too‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..",5,2021,12,11
215,Overnight treat,"My husband and I were treated to an overnight stay at the Alex Hotel. And what a treat it was. This hotel is superbly located in the centre of Dublin.  The staff at the hotel couldn‚Äôt have been more friendlier. 
We stayed in a king size room which was immaculate. We had a lovely dinner in the restaurant too. Thanks to our son and daughter for introducing us to this lovely hotel. We plan to go back!",5,2021,12,10
215,Great place to spend a week!,"We had such a good time during our week in Dublin -- Luca and Lucia's friendly help and Abdul's warm smile every morning made the place seem like home.

 Very central to walking streets and cool sites. The Christmas bar next door was cool, the James Joyce bookstore run by a mad scientist (never closed, always open) and walking distance of shopping streets, the river and pubs.

Definitely recommend!",5,2021,12,10
215,Honeymoon Experience,"We recently stayed at the Alex and we absolutely loved it! We arrived early in the morning from Canada and were worried that we would have to drop our bags and go out for the day. Eric stated that he actually had an early room and was able to accommodate us. Eric then took the time to provide details on places to visit in our short duration. He took the time to welcome us and went above and beyond the expectations. After a nice recovery nap for the day we went out returning later to a wonderful dessert treat for our honeymoon. Lucas was outstanding as well. For all the traveling we have done, I can honestly say this was the best service I have ever had and that says a lot since we are Canadian. 

As for the hotel, the bed was extremely comfortable, the breakfast was amazing and the overall atmosphere was very nice. We will definitely stay in the Alex again in the future as we hope to return to Dublin when covid is over as many things were closed in the city. 

Overall, the two night stay was fantastic mostly because of the cleanliness of the room, the amazing staff as well as the comfortable bed.

Thank you all for making our stay fantastic!",5,2021,12,09
215,Short Break,"Fantastic day in hotel & Staff were so so friendly.  
Sandra & Eric made us so welcome when arrived for lunch & then for dinner later in the evening.  We also asked to be moved table due to the breeze at the front door.  So they moved us to a little snug & it was lovely.  ",5,2021,12,08
215,Perfect for a short city stay,"This hotel is very well situated to see the great attractions Dublin has to offer. We were very pleased with the staff who were able to accommodate our early check in and out. The lobby and rooms are very chic and on-trend.

Despite the central location, the rooms are quiet.

The bed was quite firm, which was a downside for us.",5,2021,12,06
215,Weekend stay in Dublin,"The Alex is well located and the room was lovely.  Breakfast was good, but the overall ambience of the dining room, bar, etc is very average.  The service at the bar was also very average.  For the price, I think they could do better.",3,2021,12,06
215,Highly recommended,We stayed here at the start of December. The rooms were lovely. The bed was super comfortable. The breakfast was delicious with good variety for all dietary requirements. The staff were polite and helpful. Definitely recommended and we will rebook on our next visit to Dublin,5,2021,12,06
215,The Alex,"The Alex is a great place to stay in Dublin all of the staff were very helpful and polite and I would like to give a special mention to Lukas who made my stay better then I ever expected,  All the staff were brilliant too particularly Caitlin Arthur maleni and Alex, will definitley be back to stay again.",5,2021,12,05

215,Lovely City Centre Stay,"We had a lovely stay at The Alex Hotel. It's in a great location; central but not in a noisy part of town. 
We ate in the Secret Garden which is a lovely area of the restaurant. The staff were so lovely and friendly. I'll definitely be back! ",5,2021,12,05
215,My amazing experience,"I don‚Äôt normally leave reviews but I felt compelled to write this due to my amazing experience.

I had a lovely meal at the restaurant last night and I must say the service was absolutely superb. 

The food tasted amazing and the wine  delicious 

My waitress called ‚ÄúPetra‚Äù was extremely courteous and polite. She made the whole experience that much more enjoyable

I am very impressed with the service received and would highly recommend to all.

215,Good,"We loved this design hotel in Dublin. The rooms are amazing and very young design. Room service was not very good for us, because it closes very early at 9.30 pm in the evening. Breakfast was very good and reception people also. Thanks!

",3,2021,11,30
215,Not recommended,"I stayed in the Alex hotel with a friend & had family members also staying in another room! Rooms are average, hotel location isn‚Äôt great but the e-mail I received asking me to pay for the bathrobe I had taken (which I did not) really annoyed me! Not inclined to recommend or stay in an O‚ÄôCallaghan hotel again!!",1,2021,11,29
215,Worth the price,"We know the prices are a bit higher in Dublin but, compared to our previous experience in the city, The Alex Hotel totally changed our opinion about service/hotels there. From the moment I call to say we had a late arrival to the moment we checked out, their service was incredible. The staff was more than helpful and friendly and the room was amazing: clean, elegant and spacious. 
The breakfast was also a highlight of our stay! Much better than many 5-star hotels in Copenhagen. 
Their shower is lovely to the point you don't wanna turn it off and, even though we didn't have cleaning every day (for obvious reasons), the housekeepers were kind enough to provide us with fresh towels and extra shower gel.
More than happy with our choice.",5,2021,11,29
215,Fabulous,"Beautiful hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are spotless. Really comfortable bed. The location is perfect, 10 minute walk from Grafton Street. Breakfast buffet is fab, great selection. Would highly recommend.",5,2021,11,28

215,Stay and enjoy,"Only few days to attend a meeting, but enough to understand the quality of service and facilities. Close to the city center we easily reached the ""pubs zone"" by 10 minutes of walk, but we had excellent meal in the hotel's restaurant also. Polite people.",4,2021,11,26
215,10 out of 10 for this Gem Hotel,Friendly and welcoming from the minute you arrive to checkout. Rooms were spotless and the bed was so comfortable & fresh. The bar was fully stocked and staff were on the ball. Cleaning was an obvious priority throughout the hotel. Breakfast was full on fabulous. ,5,2021,11,23
215,Best hotel in Dublin,"We stayed one night at the Alex and it was so enjoyable. the staff were super nice, so friendly. the bedrooms were modern but fun (cute old phones and radios) The bed was heroic...it was like climbing into a cloud of comfort..the best bed ever. ",5,2021,11,15
215,Great hotel,"We had such a great stay at the Alex Hotel. Our room was great and we had a little hiccup that could have ruined our stay but Camille on reception solved the issue within a few minutes. She's always so smily and friendly she made our stay better. 

Katie Marie who served us dinner also is a great asset to the hotel. 

Overall the hotel is modern clean and has great staff. Would definitely return to this hotel in the future And we will be recommending it to our friends. ",5,2021,11,15
215,Damp smell from bed clothes,There was a damp smell in our room upon arrival.we established it was coming from the bed clothes. We rang reception and they had house keeping change the duvet cover while we were out. When we returned from dinner that evening we noticed the sheets still had this damp smell. This spoilt an otherwise pleasant experience. ,3,2021,11,15
215,Stylish and friendly spot,"Lucas at the front was so awesome and welcoming after a long day. He also helped me arrange some luggage storage, then remembered me and details about my trip when I returned a few days later.  The room was gorgeous and I took pics for my own house decorating‚Ä¶ thank you!",5,2021,11,15
215,"Beautiful Hotel, Perfect Experience","The rooms are just lovely, and the attention to detail was perfect. Nothing was missing or broken or less than expected. Breakfast was excellent. I felt like I was in some sort of Art Deco movie, and the style and grace was all there. Booked again to stay in December, and I literally cannot wait.",5,2021,11,14
215,The human touch,"Stayed at The Alex on a one night business trip to Ireland. 
The staff were super helpful from the start, in particular Lucas at the front desk who went above and beyond to help with our check-in troubles and worked tirelessly to help book a restaurant.
Its true that we live in a digital age but the human touch can make such a difference! 
Thank you.",5,2021,11,12

215,Good location but otherwise not very impressive.,"Great location and decent rooms.  Service quality and management not impressive though.  Breakfast very poor for such an expensive hotel - would have been fine in a low cost hotel but many/most hotels of this price/rating offer freshly cooked breakfast options, fresh juices etc. rather than a basic buffet. ",3,2021,11,09
215,Fab stay overall,"We spent the weekend in the Alex the location, room and staff we're fabulous.

The only negative was the breakfast that we ordered to the room was cold.

Would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to family and friends. ",4,2021,11,08

215,Great experience at The Alex!,"My wife and I visited the Alex on part of our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience. Lucas at the front desk was extremely welcoming with wonderful food and activity recommendations and even surprised us with champagne and dessert in our room to celebrate our honeymoon. The hotel was clean, the breakfast buffet was terrific and service at the hotel was excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the city of Dublin.",5,2021,11,07

Special mentions to Jordan, Arthur and Lucas for making sure we were we'll looked after during our stay",5,2021,11,07
215,5 star luxury experience,"We stayed in The Alex to celebrate our ten year Anniversary and it was our first night away from our 3 young kids. What a treat it was. If you like contemporary design this is the hotel for you, at checkin I felt I was in a modern Brooklyn hotel. I am not sure how long ago it was renovated but it felt almost like we were the first guests to stay there everything looks and feels so crisp, fresh shiny and brand new. Lucas checked us in and he could not have been any more friendly or welcoming. 
Our bedroom was fabulous, the bed was HUGE and so comfy and only for we had to check out I think we would still be asleep in it. The contemporary design and furniture with its blend of retro touches such as the old fashioned phone and radio was very cool. It is so close to the city and we were able to enjoy lunch and cocktails just off grafton street and some shopping. For dinner we ate in the secret garden, the setting of which is simply design and very romantic. It will be my mission to get back there for brunch on a sunny day and enjoy bubbles with the girlfriends to experience it during a different season. The heaters made it so cosy for a winter spot and the mojitos were a big hit with us both as was the friendly staff. Breakfast in the carriage restaurant was also fabulous. The whole experience felt like 5 star luxury but in a 4 star hotel. Would highly recommend and we def hope to stay again.",5,2021,11,05
215,Incredible stuff and absolutely beautiful hotel.,The hotel has a twist of art deco meets modern. Everything about it is done with perfection. The check-in staff was phenomenal. The occasions that we had to go to the bar were pleasant. And the location is second to none.,5,2021,11,01
215,The Alex Dublin,"Excellent property, cashless policy is a pain in the neck.  Food was good and service good.  The hotel was spotless. Great bar across the road, location very good, central but quiet away from the huddle and bustle in the city.",4,2021,10,31
215,Check in for a lovely experience,"Fabulous hotel, exemplary staff, excellent Covid Hygiene , excellent food. Thee most relaxing short break in a lovely stylish hotel. You can stream from phone or tablet for movies which is always a bonus! Best beds ever also, so comfortable.",5,2021,10,28

215,Overnight stay,"Hotel and staff were lovely! Breakfast was nice, not all food was hot that should have been. Sheets on bed had musty smell. Outside Bar was very pretty and well heated. Within 10 mins walk to grafton street ",4,2021,10,26
215,Good value overnight stay. Bring own food and laptop for TV.,"We had a pleasant stay here to celebrate a 21st birthday. We ordered a suite with a bottle of Prosecco, dinner and breakfast. Given the room size and what was included, I thought ‚Ç¨360 was decent value. 

Good Points:
- Large Rooms
- Nespresso machine and kettle in rooms
- Bath tub
- Ordered takeaway and was given napkins, cutlery and water by reception
- Free parking
- Beautiful decor

Bad points:
- No Netflix on TV, and couldn‚Äôt watch US Grand Prix. 
- Fish we had for dinner didn‚Äôt taste fresh, and the tar tar sauce had a top layer of darker sauce, indicating that it was lying around for a while.
- No room service (except breakfast) and no mini bar.

Overall a positive experience, staff were very accommodating and friendly. Felt welcome throughout my stay. Could have made the experience better by bringing my own food and bringing a laptop to connect to TV. Let down by dinner mains but starters were very tasty and other mains around us looked quite good.",4,2021,10,25
215,The Secret Garden,"Came here for dinner with my partner after seeing some divine instagram photos and was not disappointed. The secret garden is indeed that,  secret. Its behind the bar in a small area that's beautifully decorated. The food was very good but it was the cocktails that won it for me. Being used to Dublin prices I would have expected these cocktails to be 18 euro or so , so I was floored to see they were around 13! The staff were outstanding and given that we are In covid times and visited during a weekdaywe were still constantly checked up on with excellent attention from Lucas and the rest of the team . Will be booking this again for brunch with the girls !!",5,2021,10,25
215,Very good is exactly the right phrase,"I stayed here 3 nights. I had zero complaints.  Everything was ‚Äúvery good‚Äù as the 4 circles says.

215,"Great service, friendly staff, comfortable quiet rooms","We had a great stay at The Alex and will highly recommend it. All staff was helpful and friendly, especially guiding us through process of getting pre-travel COVID testing. Hotel is clean and beautifully kept. Great breakfast value, at night a great place to unwind with drinks. The most comfortable bed ever, super quiet rooms. Within comfortable 10 min walking of main tourist areas (Grafton/Temple Bar) and close to a couple of great Pubs. Kudos for staff who made our stay memorable, Lucas (always helpful, great advice on where to go in the city) and Eric (made us laugh and recommended the best Irish whiskey)!",5,2021,10,24
215,The perfect hotel for seeing Dublin.,"We had one night in Dublin after a walking tour so we treated ourselves to the Alex. The price was so reasonable for huge suite that we booked. It was well-designed, spotless, and the staff was helpful and kind. ",5,2021,10,22
215,Beautiful Hotel,"I unfortunately only got to spend one night at this hotel, but it was lovely! The room was pristine, with a large king size bed, plenty of outlets and a very nice bathroom. The food in the restaurant was excellent, with many options for dinner and a great breakfast buffet. Although I didn't get a chance to explore the area, it was quiet at night and easily accessed via taxi.",5,2021,10,20
215,An amazing time at a wonderful place !,I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but wow I was here the other day and it was amazing. I went for food and drinks with friends.

Hopefully that young man will be working that day !,5,2021,10,19
215,Absolutely fantastic hotel and service!,"My husband and I came to stay to see Dublin ahead of a wedding. This is our first trip since the pandemic and we were so pleased we booked The Alex. Right from the get go they were all so accommodating, Omri checked us in and assisted us during our stay, he went above and beyond. He had a solution for everything. Very very positive customer service experience. Equally Lucas was exceptionally attentive and accommodating. We think the hotel itself and amenities are brilliant. The gym was quite possibly the best equipped we have seen in a long time. A fantastic hotel and a first class team, thank you so much. We could not recommend this hotel enough.",5,2021,10,18
215,Great place to stay,"Centrally located, everything in walking distance, excellent staff and delicious food. First international trip since COVID 19, we felt safe and we‚Äôre still able to enjoy ourselves. Two good pubs nearby‚Ä¶ Ginger Bar and Kennedy‚Äôs Pub.",5,2021,10,18
215,Dublin Hideaway,Very friendly staff at front desk and breakfast bar. Great breakfast. Conveniently located near Dublin city center. Comfortable rooms. A quite place in a big city. Lucas at the front desk was very helpful.,5,2021,10,15

215,Wonderful Staff = Wonderful Experience,"My girlfriend has won a giveaway at the Hotel. We were really impressed with the quality of service. Lucas was extremely accommodating and charismatic. Made sure our experience was special. A real asset at the Alex. 

Jordan and Arthur looked after us for dinner and were lovely to talk to. They made our dinner enjoyable and fun. The house chips are to die for. 

For brunch the food was lovely and Giulia and Tamires were excellent and professional. 

Thank you all for making our experience so nice. Great food, gorgeous hotel and amazing staff !!",5,2021,10,08
215,Gorgeous hotel with lovely staff,"We had originally booked to stay here in March 2020 but with covid we were unable to fulfil the booking.  I just want to personally mention and thank Roisin who stayed in contact with me throughout the year and allowed me to change the dates several times due to the pandemic. Nothing was ever a bother to her, so thank you Roisin. We eventually got to come here in July and it was so worth the wait. We had a fabulous stay. Such a beautiful modern interior, it is gorgeous and the hotel is spotlessly clean throughout. The food was also first class, staff were lovely and the location is great too. Secure parking is available for an extra fee if required. We can‚Äôt wait to come back again and stay. My husband agrees that this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in, we highly recommend!",5,2021,10,07
215,Working away with home feel.,Recently stayed at the hotel along with colleagues working on a project at Grafton Street.

I loved the room and the decor was stunning. I am definitely staying there again. Thank you everyone at Alex.,5,2021,10,05
215,Exploring Dublin around a wedding trip,"I came from Washington D.C. to Dublin for a good friend's wedding in August. Like most cross-Atlantic trips to Europe, I landed very early in the morning and got to The Alex at 8:30 am - I fully expected to have to check my bags at the front desk, but they gladly checked me into a room early since they had one available: awesome first impression.

The hotel is perfect for anybody looking for a modern, clean, comfortable, quiet room. The location is pretty good too; it's very close to Trinity and a 10 minute walk from city center (although I was advised by local friends to not venture too far to the east of the hotel at night/alone).

I had one meal (breakfast) at the hotel restaurant and it was very good: an all you can eat buffet that was manned by a dedicated server, plus there was protective glass between all guests and the food, so cleanliness and sanitation was an obvious priority for the hotel.

I wanted to work out my first full morning in Dublin (of course after waking up early due to jet lag), and I was directed to their sister hotel a block away. It was by far the nicest gym I've ever seen at a hotel - nicer than most actual gyms I've ever been to. It had a tremendous amount of options/equipment and was very clean...A+.

I needed to grab a taxi on two different occasions, and the front desk staff was more than happy to accommodate. Both times the taxi showed up in about 5 minutes; the last time (on way to the airport to return home), I had checked my bags at the front desk for a few hours and the person at the front desk wouldn't take a 5 Euro tip: he said ""oh please, we insist to do this complimentary"".

Omri was the person I interacted with the most - he made me feel extremely welcomed and gave me an easy experience all together.",5,2021,10,04
215,Fantastic hotel!,"I'm just back from an overnight stay at The Alex and I couldn't fault it. Such a modern beautifully decorated hotel.. Room was absolutely spotless. We also arrived to a plate of desserts and a happy birthday card which was so lovely.

We had lunch in the secret garden restaurant when we arrived which was 10/10. Food and decor both amazing! 

Access to the executive lounge for drinks and snacks was also a nice touch, seeing as I had  booked one of the executive rooms. Lucas at reception was so friendly and welcoming! (All staff were very welcoming).

Location is great - Only 5/10 mins walk to Grafton Street.

Will def be back! :)",5,2021,10,04
215,Our wonderful wedding at The Alex!,"We had our wedding in The Alex hotel on the 13th Sept. It is very hard to explain how wonderful a venue this is but what really made our day and subsequent stay special was the staff. 
The hotel itself is a fresh modern hotel with exceptionally high standards which oozes class. The food is wonderful and they make a mean cocktail! 
The staff however are outstanding, every single one of them. From the original booking and meeting with Kathryn to our check out. 
A special thank you to Kathryn, Paul & Sidney for how organised and seamless the day was and for your kindness to myself and Mark. To everyone front of house for looking after my family and friends so well and a special shout out to Abdul for looking after us all at breakfast the next morning! You are all a really special bunch of people who clearly take pride in what you do. 
We had a lot of friends and family stay overnight as well and the feedback from everyone has been phenomenal. 
You helped create and make memories that will last with us all forever. I wish we could do it all again tomorrow!! 
We will be back soon!",5,2021,09,29
215,The Alex Hotel,"Very much enjoyed our time there, excellent service & lovely clean hotel. Would definitely recommend!! Situated in a very great location, allowing you to pretty much walk to anything you may be interested in!",5,2021,09,29
215,"Great hotel, don‚Äôt book breakfast","Everything was great, super friendly staff, amazing bedroom & decor throughout the hotel, dinner and cocktails fab. Only fault was breakfast which totally let down the whole experience. Staff were unfriendly, uncoordinated and all over the place. Food was cold, had to ask 3 times (3 different servers) for toast which was brought out cold after we had finished eating. Had to ask for coffee 3 times too, nobody asked if we wanted eggs or anything cooked to order even though we could hear them asking tables next to us. Would absolutely return to the hotel but would not get or recommend booking breakfast. Such a letdown at the end of a great experience",4,2021,09,27
215,GREAT STAY at the Alex after 4 times trying to make it to Ireland since 2020,"We have been trying to come to Ireland since May, 2020.  After the 4th time rescheduling due to COVID Restrictions,  we finally made it!!  I would like to especially send a ""shout out"" to Roisin McCarthy for her help with getting the rooms rescheduled 4 times!!  Thank you to The Alex, for a wonderful accommodation, great location and fantastic staff all around!!  Would definitely recommend!!  :)",5,2021,09,25
215,Staff appears to all be new.,We were part of a Perry Golf tour and 7 couples stayed at this hotel on the last night of our tour. We were the only couple to stay an extra night. We had stayed at 5 star hotels in Killarney and Donbeg and this hotel did not meet our expectations,3,2021,09,25

215,Excellent staff,"I recommend this hotel. One reason among other is the quality of people at the desk . Specially Camille.
The location is great . Breakfast is more than correct. The concierge will do his best to please you and fix reservations issues.",4,2021,09,13
215,Very helpful Lucas,"A group of us called into the Alex this morning for coffee and croissants. We were 11 adults and three children and this was about 10.45. Lucas took our order,m brought the very nice coffee promptly gave the correct order to each person, brought us water afterwards and got my sister cake and ice cream as she does not eat gluten, he could not have been more helpful. ",5,2021,09,12
215,Highly recommend,"This was our second visit to The Alex Hotel and we once again had a lovely stay. The location is great, the staff are lovely and the hotel facilities are excellent. We stayed in an Executive King which was spacious, the beds are very comfortable, and the access to the Executive Lounge was a treat. Although it is grab and go at the moment, it‚Äôs so useful to have access to drinks and snacks.
We had brunch in The Secret Garden at the hotel and it was delicious and the decor is unique and a perfect brunch location. Breakfast was delivered to the room and that was lovely too. Overall, highly recommend.",5,2021,09,12
215,Excellent stay in Dublin,Two night stay so that we could visit relatives for the first time in 18 months. Room was fantastic (Room 200) and the staff couldn't have done more. Meal in the restaurant on the first nice was very nice. ,5,2021,09,11
215,A lovely stay that made me feel at home.,The staffs at The Alex are friendly and helpful.  The location is ideal for everything I'd like to do in Dublin.  Shops and restaurants are within a short walk and yet quiet in the evening.  I will most like stay at The Alex again when I return.,5,2021,09,10
215,Highly recommended stay,"Had a brilliant stay in the Alex this weekend. Dined in the in-house restaurant and our waiter, Arthur, was fantastic. The food was amazing and the detail of the hotel room was also flawless. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay city centre. ",5,2021,09,07
215,Beautiful design and very kind staff,"The staff was very kind and helpful. We stayed in a room next to the elevators, but didn‚Äôt hear them at all.
The gym in The Mont across the street has a lot of equipment and is very clean. During our stay The Mont was closed, but we could still go there which was very nice.
And we loved the interior!",5,2021,09,07
215,Mother Daughter trip,Would highly recommend The Alex Hotel as a place to stay. Excellent from start to finish in all aspects. Lovely staff especially at dinner both evenings. Great location and convenient parking. Hygiene excellent. ,5,2021,09,06
215,Perfect Staycation,"Booked a Friday evening stay with the bed & brunch package for my partner‚Äôs birthday. The bed was so comfortable and the room was beautifully furnished. We loved the late check-out with the package, because it meant we could sleep in all morning in that heavenly bed. Eoin & Lucas were so helpful and friendly, when I rang down to push back our brunch reservation to a later time so we could sleep in, he was so accommodating. Lovely lunch in the Secret Garden, gorgeous cocktails and tasty food. We‚Äôll be back!",5,2021,09,05
215,Gorgeous new hotel in central Dublin,"The Alex is a beautiful new hotel in central Dublin - a wonderful location within walking distance of so much. We had both breakfast and lunch in the restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious. And our room (an Executive King) was gorgeous. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2021,09,04
215,Great hotel for city stay,"Great location, very spacious and comfortable room, good and friendly service, nice breakfast in keeping with COVID restrictions, access to excellent gym in nearby hotel, very good wifi. Breakfast service could be slightly improved.",5,2021,09,01
215,Overnight Stay,"The hotel was spotless, the staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was very nice. The location is close to shopping malls and amenities. Also close to airport.  The room had everything you would want and was very well presented with a lovely shower. ",5,2021,08,31
215,"Clean room, nice design, very little in terms of service or amenities. LOUD LOUD LOUD door slamming!","The Alex was an ok stay for us. The room was nice and clean. Very bare in terms of any amenities -- no robes, no slippers, no mini bar, no room service (except breakfast) -- apparently the kitchen can make food but you have to collect it yourself (also, no menu was found in the room and we had to go online to look one up). No room refresh ""due to COVID"" unless you request it -- odd, since the other hotels we stayed at still managed to provide turn down and cleaning services daily. Comfortable bed and nice pillows -- biggest complaint is the LOUD LOUD LOUD slamming of doors all day/night. I have no idea why anyone would design a hotel like this, but you can clearly see almost a 2cm gap at the bottom of the room door into the hallways. This means you can hear every person, dragging suitcase, elevator ding, and every single door being closed. Ridiculous. This alone really affected our stay. Being jetlagged and trying to get any semblance of sleep is very difficult, being jolted awake each time someone left their room. It didn't help that someone on our floor couldn't seem to understand how to unlock his room door, so would stand and open/close it over and over. The room itself was perfectly fine but I wouldn't stay here again, especially for the price.",3,2021,08,30
215,Fabulous Hotel,"Fabulous Hotel, a short stroll from Trinity College, Grafton St and St Stephen's Green. Convenient parking beside the hotel, which the hotel gives you a code to enter, reasonable rates. Very efficient check in, we (3) had booked Junior Suite but turned out to be the bigger Alex Suite which was an amazing treat. The suite was amazing, huge bathroom with big tub and rain shower. The third bed was a comfortable roll out. Plenty of relaxing seating and not one but two TVs. Nespresso machine and all the extras. We had access to the executive lounge for drinks and snacks. Dinner in the Secret Garden outdoor restaurant was lovely, nice ambience. Our rate included breakfast which overall was excellent value for a luxury hotel stay. Staff were all very nice and helpful. Will definitely return and highly recommend this lovely hotel. ",5,2021,08,27
215,Stunning hotel & staff,"The hotel is modern and very well equipped. The staff at reception were amazing (especially Lucia and Omri and another very kind man who took photos of me and my mum) and definitely made the stay more memorable, they never hesitated to help us even when I asked a lot of them. Breakfast was also great and I would really recommend it. Unfortunately we didn't have time for the Secret Garden but I will be returning to stay and visit. Great location, everything was perfect. Can't wait to return!",5,2021,08,24
215,Fab stay.,"Lovely stay. Arrived very early and we were allowed to check in early which was great as we were attending the all-ireland. Room was lovely, comfy and had the most amazing bed. Front counter staff were very friendly. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2021,08,23
215,Great overnight stay with my nieces.,Enjoyed a pre back to school night in the city with my nieces. Love the style and atmosphere at the Alex. Our Room was bright and airy with all mod cons and more importantly super comfortable beds! Lovely breakfast the following morning. Will definitely be back. ,5,2021,08,23
215,Can't wait to stay again ,"We had a lovely stay in the Alex over the weekend. Clean hotel with nice staff that went above and beyond. 

We were staying for my partners birthday & I told the hotel this. They left craft beers from our local town in the room which was such a lovely, personalised gesture. 

We ate in the secret garden on our first night in the hotel & the food and service was fantastic, I could not fault it. The staff were so friendly & happy. I would stay here again & will recommend it to friends. 

Thanks so much for a lovely stay, we really had a great time.",5,2021,08,22
215,Very nice,We went for dinner in the carriage restaurant in the Alex. All the staff were lovely and welcoming. The ambiance was lovely and the food was beautiful and nicely presented. Staff members efficiently came down to us throughout our time there asking if we needed anything. The manager (unsure of his name) was absolutely lovely and went out of his way to describe the menu items to us. Eric was also extremely friendly with us and efficient. I would recommend this place to anyone and will probably return soon!,5,2021,08,21
215,Beautiful hotel,"Nice hotel, off Merrion Square, walk to Grafton St, Trinity College, St Stephens Green reasonably priced. Stayed here many times. This particular O'Callaghan hotel is NOT handicap accessible is that's a need. ",4,2021,08,20
215,"After comparing my poor experience with the recent reviews, there must be two hotels??","We spent the last 4 nights of our Dublin 11 night quarantine trilogy here, after seeing the hotels gleaming reviews (Sunday-Thursday). Smooth check in, decent, clean room & decent facilities.
The hotel is near Trinity College, which we assumed would be a hive of student nightlife. The reality is most pubs only open Wed-Sat, restaurant close in the evenings & generally very dead in the immediate area.
My first major issue is the ability to work at the hotel. The WIFI is the ‚Äòfill in your email & password‚Äô, which you have to repeat on each devise 4 or 5 times a day. Try a Zoom call when the WiFi drops, they do an unannounced fire alarm check or housekeeping are knocking on the door because the ‚Äòdo not disturb‚Äô sign is missing!
What I did find out from the very nice housekeeping team, was that the room is serviced every third day! Nothing mentioned when booking, website, when checking in or on the information sheet you are given.
The excuse might be COVID, but that didn‚Äôt happen at my previous hotel at the same price point. I got a turn down service there. ¬£150 per night room only & you don‚Äôt even get your bed made or your bin emptied for three days.
To get basics like coffee & milk for hospitality tray, drinking water or a bin empty etc you need to request each time. Really??
The walls & doors of the room are thin, you can here the TV next door & people taking in the corridor. The room doors bang shut with a hell of a bang.
My major issue was with the rude staff members I encountered, who seem to think it‚Äôs ok to ignore a customer waiting at reception, while the continue their conversation, some times work related, sometimes not. What‚Äôs wrong with the usual courteous response of ‚Äúhello Sir, I‚Äôll be with you in just a minute‚Äù?
No, did you enjoy your stay, is there anything else you need, no nothing. I started with a disappointing experience & left feeling angry. 
Surely I should expect better for ¬£600 of hard earned cash?? Clearly I won‚Äôt be returning here.",2,2021,08,19
215,Gorgeous hotel in the heart of Dublin,Stayed at the Alex for a short staycation. A beautiful hotel with very friendly staff in an excellent location. We spent time around Grafton Street and the national Gallery before drinks and a meal in the evening. Would definitely recommend a stay here and will we be back in the future.,5,2021,08,16
215,A Gem in the Heart of Dublin,"Loved everything about The Alex Hotel and our stay there.  Great location, just a short walk from the Grafton Street area and very close to Merrion Square for a nice park walk.
The decor is classy and chique and the hotel is spotlessly clean.  The bed was so comfortable I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.  We had brunch in the Secret Garden which is beautiful and the food was delicious.
The staff were very friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble.  Omri was particularly helpful and so welcoming.
We will definitely be back. ",5,2021,08,16
215,Nice hotel in a good location,"Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Only place we stayed in our 3 week trip that had a refrigerator in the room.  Hotel is located close to all major sites in Dublin center, but on a very quiet street.  Staff was very helpful in providing information and arranging transportation.",5,2021,08,15
215,Perfect hotel in Dublin!,"The hotel is just perfect! The staff is lovely, the location in the city center, the decor modern and cool, the room spacious and clean, the bed is super comfy, the bathroom amenities smelled so good. Recommend this hotel 10/10!
",5,2021,08,14
215,Great location. Modern rooms,Close to trinity college and 10-15 minute walk from Temple bar this is a great location for being in the city without being in the noise. The breakfast is buffet style and spot on for what you need. The rooms are spacious and modern. Car parking is available but is 100m down the road in a secure underground parking at an extra charge,5,2021,08,13
215,Perfect location and perfect accommodation.,"We dealt with two different Eoghans at the front desk, one at checkin and one at check out and they were both fantastic. Exceptionally pleasant and easy to deal with.  
The accommodation was perfect, the bed was comfortable and everything was perfectly clean. 
The location of the hotel also made it special, close to Merrion square, Grafton street and Trinity- nice safe walk through Dublin. Parking was reasonable and easily accessible. 
We will definitely stay again.  
Many thanks for a very enjoyable time.  ",5,2021,08,13
215,"Excellent experience, highly recommend. Central location.","Fantastic experience from start to finish. Customer service was second to none, from Eoin at check in, to the manager Paul and the staff in the restaurant. The room was gorgeous. Modern and tasteful decor in the room/bathroom which were absolutely spotless. Honestly felt like we were the first ever to stay in the room-it was that clean and fresh ! The bed was super comfortable and huge, pure luxury. We had dinner in the restaurant and the food & service were excellent. Very central location, but yet, on a quiet street which is a real plus for a city centre hotel which meant no noise but only around the corner from everything, A bonus for us was that the hotel had parking. Not easy to find with a Dublin hotel. Overall we were so glad we chose the Alex, will definitely be returning.",5,2021,08,12
215,Business in Dublin,"Excellent and reasonably priced hotel just off the beaten track but a minutes walk from Trinity College and a little more to St Stephen‚Äôs Square. 
Art Deco abounds from the smart work area to the in house restaurant. 
The room itself was gloriously comfortable with a super king size bed, proper down filled duvets and pillows, good sound proofing and black out curtains. 
Great shower and bathroom, good wifi (little short on the tea and coffee making facilities but not enough to knock off a star)
Well worth it and will come again",5,2021,08,12
215,Perfect from start to finish,"From check-in to check-out, it was amazing! The staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating, the vibe from the hotel was unique and, the room was clean, spacious and relaxing!

215,A wonderful 6 night stay,The Alex hotel is extremely well located in the City - close to attractions and shopping as well as the DART station at Pearse. I used the station to access stunning walks north and south of Dublin. I stayed in an executive room - it was very comfortable and clean. The bed was awesome. Access to free snacks and drinks was a bonus. The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful.   I will be back! ,5,2021,08,11

It‚Äôs a great find: spacious, tastefully decorated rooms with comfy beds within walking distance of Dublins‚Äôs main attractions. The Alex staff are friendly, caring and so helpful. When my Fitbit wouldn‚Äôt charge in my room? No problem- they offered to charge it at the front desk. When we had trouble accessing our return to America COVID-19 tests on our phones? 2 different staff members worked with us to resolve the issue. Everyone at the Alex wants to make your experience there the best it can be. We enjoyed our stay and I can absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2021,08,09
215,"Lovely, well located, and luxury feel","Great location, lovely staff, luxury feel to the hotel rooms. We had a bit of disturbance from a refrigeration lorry that delivers every morning so I would recommend to check where your room is. We were in Suite 300, above the coffee shop in the hotel - you may wish to request a room on the other side. We would highly recommend the hotel for couples looking for a high-end getaway that's close to the city centre (we walked everywhere) ",4,2021,08,09
215,"Beautiful hotel, perfect central location yet quiet location. Modern, mid century decor. Super comfortable beds.","We arrived midday and were thankful to get an early checking after a long travel day from the US.

215,Disappointing and mistrusting,The bedroom was paid for before arrival. On arrival when booking for dinner in the restaurant we were asked for details of another credit card which is common enough with covid and bookings. There was a ‚Ç¨50 deposit taken. At dinner our meal came to ‚Ç¨56 because it went over the ‚Ç¨50 deposit another ‚Ç¨50 had to be taken again the credit card details had to be taken agai. They had my credit card from the booking for the bedroom but they felt they need to ask not once but twice for credit card details. ‚Ç¨100 deposit was taken in the end for the ‚Ç¨56 meal and the rest was to be refunded. This felt like they thought we were criminals who would run out of the hotel without paying for our meal that went ‚Ç¨6 over the first deposit. So disappointing and mistrusting. ,2,2021,07,28
215,Family package,"Hotel and rooms are beautiful, food is great. Be aware that kid‚Äôs food is not included in the family package even though it says ‚Äú2 course meal per person‚Äù. This was an issue but overall a great experience. The cookies are AMAZING!  ",5,2021,07,27

215,Wedding Day Magic,"Planning a wedding during a pandemic has it's challenges, but I have to say that Dima and all the staff in the hotel made the whole process an absolute pleasure to engage in. From the first contact, everything was clear and up front. All of our options and contingencies were explained and Dima maintained close contact throughout and was extremely quick to address any concerns or requests that we had. 
The day itself was perfect and once again the staff warmth and attentiveness were to the fore. Lucas and two lovely chaps called Eoin could not do enough for us and all of our guests complimented us on our choice of venue. 
I strongly recommend the Alex Hotel for the smaller, boutique type wedding. I believe they can cater for much larger functions too, but for us, with 25 guests, the Rovos room was just perfect. 
Thank you so much to all that helped us have the best day of our lives.",5,2021,07,19

My room was clean, well presented, and the furnishings were lovely. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the other furnishings were quite stylish and useful, as well. Oh and the shower was perfection!

Thank you again for the most lovely stay! I immediately came home and looked up the other hotels within your group, so I may very well try another one soon (if I do not decide to return to The Alex instead).

Best wishes to you and your staff!",5,2021,07,01

There's a games room on the main floor which is perfect for families to chill out and has fun games for all the family.

215,3rd person had to sleep on the sofa,"Beautiful hotel, however we booked a room for 3 people, only to arrive to one double bed and a duvet on the sofa for the 3rd person. The plug in the bath was broken, therefore couldn't have a bath - one of the reasons I booked a suite. Suite much smaller than pictured, and didn't exactly match the pictures online. 

Overall, disappointed with the hotel itself. Brunch the next day was on high chairs where your knees were sitting on the table, having to lean right down to actually eat - not enjoyable and highly uncomfortable.",3,2020,12,07

215,Small Wedding dinner during COVID restrictions,"We stayed here the night of of wedding along with a small number of friends. It was a small group of people as this was during level 5 Covid restrictions and we were really just looking for somewhere to stay, eat and drink. Other hotels in Dublin were looking to charge us ‚Ç¨500 to just hire a room which didn't include any drinks or meals and there wasn't even any guarantee that we could stay overnight. 
The Alex were very accommodating and flexible for us, we were treated brilliantly. We were given complimentary prosecco in all rooms and at the bar upon arrival.
The rooms, restaurant/bar and common areas were very modern and appear to have been renovated recently.
I dealt with a lady over the phone for my bookings, I believe here name was R√≥is√≠n and she was very helpful.
I would highly recommend the Alex for small group gatherings such as what we had.",5,2020,11,02

Everything was wonderful, the staff were so attentive and helpful, nothing was a problem and all the while maintaining and adhering to COVID safety precautions and guidelines. The food was amazing... from the canapes at the drinks reception, to the main wedding meal and the nibbles that were bought out after, everything was just so tasty and delicious. We ordered our breakfast to the room the following morning. The wrong one was brought up first but it was no problem for them to bring us a new one. Felipe at the front desk sorted it effortlessly with no fuss at all. He really was such a pleasure to deal with, always a smile on his face and so ready and willing to help all guests. I think all the staff did an amazing job in these really difficult and trying times. My sister had an amazing day and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks so much to everyone at The Alex.",5,2020,10,27

215,October COVID wedding at The Alex,"Due to COVID restrictions myself and my now husband were looking for a Dublin venue for our wedding with 2 weeks notice!

We were beyond happy with our wedding at The Alex. The food was amazing, the rooms were beautiful, and the staff at The Alex were so attentive and really made our day special.

I am already looking forward to my next stay!",5,2020,10,21
215,New outdoor ‚Äúcarriage @ The Alex‚Äù restaurant ,"Excellent.!! I recommend their new outdoor area, the carriage at the Alex. It is basically not outdoors, as they have a fully retractable canopy roof, and it is heated perfectly so you don‚Äôt feel any cold at all. 

The food was very very good, and Mario our waiter was exceptional. The staff were all very professional, and the indoor appearance and decor of the hotel is very modern and pleasant. 

A special place to bring someone, and it is not the sort of costs you would associate with a 4/5 star hotel in Dublin city center. The food and drinks were quite reasonable. Can‚Äôt wait to get back. ",5,2020,10,20
215,Fantastic 2 day getaway ,"One of the nicest hotels I‚Äôve stayed in Dublin. The staff are so friendly and helpful, food was excellent and decor is fantastic. 

Felipe on reception was so welcoming and friendly, he really looked after us - we were handed hot hand towels on arrival which was a nice touch, we got a beautiful King Deluxe room on the 6th floor. The room was so spacious with a skyline view of Dublin. Nice touches in the room was a Nespresso machine, mini fridge, massive TV with a chrome cast so we could watch movies from our devices and a bottle of Prosecco and chocolates was lovely touch. The room and hotel decor is beautiful a retro style with lavish furniture- bed was so comfortable, the rain shower was great.

Breakfast was delicious, a lovely selection. We had the veg option and and eggs Benedict which were fab, Abdul who ran the breakfast was a lovely man was so helpful and obliging. We had dinners both nights in the carriage, both meals were excellent, really well presented and the service was quick and attentive !! good job to both people ran it(didn‚Äôt get their names)

215,October Dub-cation,"My fiance & I stayed in The Alex hotel for the first time last week, a 4 night Dub-cation.  We had a fantastic stay, feeling extremely welcome & safe right from our arrival to departure.  The hotel was kept very clean & was fully set up to meet the COVID restrictions.  Our suite was lovely, very spacious & apart from lack of hooks to hang up towels & the bed being a little soft, we couldn't fault it!  

From Felipe & all the reception staff, always greeting us as we walked by the front desk, making the time wish us a good morning, to ask how our day went etc,, to Abdul & Sandra working in the restaurant, giving us such personalised service over breakfast each day & also the staff behind the bar & in the Steam coffee shop. 
One of the girls in the coffee shop even ran over to help me get into the lift as I almost dropped my carefully balanced coffee one morning!  Extremely professional, efficient & friendly team in the hotel & we would definitely stay there again...and recommend it to others! :)",5,2020,10,17

215,"Gorgeous Hotel, Great Location","Due to restrictions myself and my partner decided to stay in Dublin, we're so glad we chose The Alex! I'm from Dublin so know my way around, it was so nice to have somewhere near to the city but not in the middle of it.
From the minute we arrived we felt comfortable, the hotel is spotless, with staff seen regularly cleaning high touch areas and following all covid guidelines, masks etc.
The rooms are a great size, beds are so comfortable and again spotless.
The food in the restaurant was delicious, plenty to choose from on the food and drinks menu. Tables are spaced so that everyone feels comfortable and the new terrace are is stunning.
I didn't get all the names of the staff that looked after us but big shout out to Felipe, Lucia, Giovanna, Lucas and Mario.

215,"Really enjoyable meal, great service","During level 3 of this pandemic, it is extremely difficult to find restaurants in Dublin which will take outdoor bookings, due to an incredibly high demand.

My friends and I were lucky enough to book a table for 4. The food was delicious, with great vegetarian options. Our server, Lucia, was incredibly friendly and made sure we were well catered for.

Thank you Lucia and to the rest of the staff for making this an enjoyable experience.",5,2020,10,13
215,Good food and nice staff,"We were due to have an event in The Alex Hotel in May, but of course COVID had other plans.
I have to say, I am quiet happy that this event has been pushed out until 2021 because the level of customer service that Shauna gives is second to none and has turned a stressful planning period into that of a reassuring one.
Making herself available anytime I have a question, genuinely taking an interest (always asking how my little one is in the background) ‚Äì she is a professional in the events field to say the least which I have found hard to come by over the last few months.
Having organised several events with the hotel over the years, I look forward to returning every year and the staff in the hotel are just fabulous to deal with.
I popped in for lunch last week and had it out in the new outdoor terrace ‚Äì Stunning!
Highly recommend the steak sandwich, and a shoutout to Mario for his welcoming manner.
One of, if not my favourite hotel in Dublin and would suggest Shauna for any event or meeting needs.",5,2020,10,12

215,Amazing stay in this little gem of a hotel,"We had the best stay at the Alex last weekend. It was my husband‚Äôs 40th birthday and despite all the current restrictions the staff couldn‚Äôt have made us more welcome. They upgraded us to a beautiful room and surprised us with Prosecco and chocolates in the room on arrival. The hotel is beautiful and the decor modern and fresh. It‚Äôs just a short walk to Grafton street so is in the perfect location. The food was absolutely incredible and we couldn‚Äôt have faulted anything about our stay. A special mention to Felipe in reception who was just so lovely, warm and welcoming to us and could not have done more for us. Also Gio, Lucia and Lukas in the restaurant. All the staff were just wonderful. We really hope to make it back to The Alex soon!",5,2020,10,08
215,Perfect hotel stay for an anniversary! Beautifully Designed.,"We booked originally with The Mont and were told due to Covid that they would most likely not be open for our reservation date - Alternatively they offered us to stay at the sister hotel The Alex! They honoured our ""Down to Business"" package and rate which was all the more reason to go with the booking. It worked out for the best! Although we would love to stay in The Mont - That'll be the next trip! We were spending an anniversary there and were upgraded and given a complimentary bottle of prosecco and desserts which was absolutely lovely and unexpected! We had dinner in The Carriage and had a lovely 2 course dinner. The atmosphere was very nice throughout and the Receptionists/general staff were very kind and helpful. Specifically our dealings with Felipe at reception - He was wonderful and really was so kind from the minute we checked in to when we checked out. The Executive room that we stayed in was perfect - Exactly as it appears in the photos online. We had breakfast delivered to our room in the morning which arrived in baskets and had more than enough of a serving for both of us! The room was very comfortable and we had all of the supplies we could have needed (with the knowledge from reception that we could ask for more supplies if needed). Basically overall we had such a wonderful stay and the staff were so pleasant - Especially during the difficult time of being in a pandemic and trying to keep everything running as safely and professionally as they could! I would recommend anyone visiting Dublin to book here.  Again, thank you to Felipe for his customer service!",5,2020,10,04

Celebrated a special birthday recently at the hotel with my family. We had food and drinks in their outside terrace and bar, a really cool spot and a must if your looking for some tasty food and cocktails. Great night's sleep, comfortable bed and spacious room followed the next morning with a top class breakfast. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.

215,"Great stay at The Alex, we will be back, highly recommend!","We were initially booked to stay at the Green hotel in April 2020 but this was rearranged because of the pandemic. This was no problem at all and was handled very well by the hotel, we were able to pick whatever date we wanted and we would still pay the same price as when we originally booked. Although due to the new restrictions in Dublin, our booking was moved to the Alex hotel, which we didn‚Äôt mind as we understand under the circumstances. Our stay was great, the hotel is in a great location and is absolutely faultless. It‚Äôs very handy to have the carpark access nearby. Amanda helped us check in and check out and she was lovely and very helpful. Despite restrictions in Dublin we still had a wonderful weekend and can‚Äôt wait to return. Thank you very much!",5,2020,09,29
215,Father to be.... and a shared birthday.,"The most amazing two days. Not only my birthday but also the birth of my second son. This fab hotel is located very close to the Maternity Hospital, and was perfect to be on call for my wife. With covid restrictions the experience at the hospital was so unusual but The Alex staff done everything to help us along. A wonderful touch of some chocolates to the room and checking in with me each time I passed the desk to enquire after my wife and my baby son. Warm, pleasant, impeccably clean, all the covid restrictions needed to feel safe. Just an amazing experience and one that was enhanced greatly by the staff. Not to mention the food. Pre covid I have stayed in hotels a lot for work and travel and this is in my opinion the best hotel in Dublin currently, it competes and wins against the well established premium hotels in the city that we all associate with luxury. The Alex is my preferred hotel. The decor is modern chic, with an industrial twist. Every corner looks like a Pinterest photo, the food and choices are fabulous and the rooms are spacious, clean and so comfortable. However what makes this hotel stand apart, is the staff. Thank you one and all! Alex... not a bad name for a boy... ;)",5,2020,09,26
215,Exceptional escape from the Gloom,"We natives of Dublin cannot leave our county right now. So my wife Mary and I decided to take a much needed break in the heart of our fair city ... and what a wonderful treat it was thanks to the exceptional efforts of our hosts at The Alex Hotel. From the moment Keith and Felipe checked us into this gleaming, modern property we were given a good old-fashioned Irish Welcome. Covid lockdown has drawn down the shutters on most attractions in Dublin, across the spectrum from the breakfast buffet to museums, galleries and even our world famous pubs. Yet each of our three nights at The Alex were a treasure. Sandra and Abdul ensured each day got off to the perfect start, serving a fabulous 'Full Irish' with charm and good cheer, while Gio and Mario kept the show on the road after sundown in the bar-restaurant. The menu was varied, very tasty and good value. Few people are out and about at present but the exceptionally friendly and welcoming staff at The Alex worked their socks off to make our experience memorable. This indeed was a Great Escape for both of us.",5,2020,09,26
215,Friday Night Girls' Night,"Fantastic night, celebration made really special from moment we arrived, Ester on reception relaxed us into our experience. Styling throughout the hotel is beautiful, balloons and bubbles left by Sophie and team were such a great surprise in my room! lovely dinner on Winter Garden Terrace. Lukas was spot on with food and wine recommendations. Cocktails to finish the night. Definitely coming back!!",5,2020,09,26

215,Amazing Winter Garden at The Alex Hotel - you must go there!!!,"My wife and I went to the Winter Garden at The Alex Hotel for dinner last evening, and we loved it!!! What a beautiful setting, just on the perimeter of the main hotel, a secluded garden setting with very comfortable seating, electric heaters all around to keep us warm, and a motorised retractable roof! Our waiting staff - Ben - was excellent, even offered to mix us cocktails that weren't on the drinks menu, and that skill is hard to find these days in Dublin. The Irish old Fashioned was to die for, as was my wife's French Martini. So good that we each had a second one straight away! We decided to share a starter, and what a good starter we chose - baked prawn and chorizo, we really couldn't have asked for better. Next time I will definitely try the deep fried brie, it looked fab. For our main course, we both opted for the burger, and that was so very good, served along with their special and very different house cut chips. We decided to forego dessert as we couldn't eat another thing. A great evening, delicious food and drink, and wonderful staff. What more could anyone want? We'll be back again and again!",5,2020,09,24

215,From start to finish the hotel staff were Amazing!,"Planning a wedding can be stressful but during these uncertain  COVID-19 times it can be even more stressful..but not with The Alex Hotel. Where do I start...Shauna was like the fairy god mother, anything my parents  wanted for their big day their wishes  were granted. No request was  too big or too small. 
The hotel staff were  fantastic! Every staff member wore a mask and kept their distance.  The service was second to none. I cannot recommend this hotel enough! Our family felt very safe. 
Thr staff have adapted to new procedures and make it look like a smooth transition. Well done guys! Keep doing what you are doing!

215,Beautiful Hotel with Excellent Staff,"We popped in for a meal and some drinks. We were greeted and looked after by Ben Giovana who made our experience. Ben was so warm, welcoming and accommodating. I have dietary requirements and he sorted them immediately. He was attentive and check-in to see how the food was and if we need any more drinks. 

We sat in the garden which is absolutely stunning and the entire hotel is clean, modern and chic. It's an influencer's dream as the aesthetic is on point everywhere you turn, and a perfect photo opportunity. 

If you're looking for a spot for dinner and drinks, I highly recommend the Alex as you will be so well looked after. I am hoping that when we return, Ben will be there again!",5,2020,09,13

215,A great experience,"My partner and I stayed at The Alex for 4 days, 3 nights. We ended up spending most of our time at the hotel as the city was mostly still under lockdown.

Luckily for us, the hotel was great. The room was super comfortable, the gym has everything one can need, the staff was always helpful and accommodating. 

Huge thanks to Esther, Felipe, and Amanda at reception, to the restaurant/bar staff, and the cleaning team - everything was spotless. 

Highly recommended.",5,2020,09,11
215,"Amazing stay, will most definitely be back!","We stayed for one night and truly loved it. Stunning interiors and the attention to detail is perfect in every way.  The food and service was impeccable. Sandra in the restaurant was amazing along with Abdul and Lucia (hope I have spelt correctly). Reception and check in was flawless too.
I am a new fan of the Alex! Cant wait to come back, perfect location for shopping in Grafton street, less than a 15 minute walk.",5,2020,09,11
215,Warm and welcoming,"I was there last week and I had a warm welcome from Damla and fantastic cocktails from Ben. I can also highly recommend the food at the hotel. The menu offers a good selection of dishes and the service is as always great 
I highly recommend it and I will be back for sure.",5,2020,09,10
215,Wedding party,"A couple of weeks ago I was looking for a venue to our wedding party. I was tired, because I wasn't finding any place. We decided to look nearby Registry Office, I found The Alex Hotel then and Felipe (from reception area) treated me very well and he had been so friendly. He told me about a new area called ""gardner area"" and finally I had found a perfect venue.  Every detail were discussed with Shauna, who was very attentive and kind . On the party's day, the Staff were kind and receptive. The Alex's chef was perfect, the food was tasty and the presentation were amazing. The gardner area is a romantic venue for a wedding party. I truly recommend to anybody to threw a party/reception at The Alex Hotel. We'll never forget this place and the moments we had there.

215,Lovely dinner evening,"My husband and I went to the Alex to celebrate our anniversary. The place is beautiful, nice music and atmosphere. The food and wine we ordered were nice, but what worthwhile the most was the friendly, polite and helpful staff that joined us during all the evening. All of them were protected with face mask and sanitised everything after been touched. We were welcomed by Esther and served by Damla and Ben, who made our dinner a great experience. They were chatty, professional and always with a kind attitude.
Luckily you will be served by them when you go to The Alex in order to experience the nice treatment that me and my husband had.",5,2020,09,06
215,Amazing hotel-especially the staff,"We just left the Alex after a two night stay and I would highly recommend. The staff make this hotel, they couldn‚Äôt do enough for us from the minute we arrived. They were extremely helpful and friendly, especially Felipe, Ester, lukas, Abdul and another lovely tall man who served us in the carriage restaurant. The rooms were lovely and modern. The food was gorgeous. We will definitely book again the next time we are in Dublin. 10/10",5,2020,09,05
215,Amazing Surprise,"My Husband, his parents that are from Cork and I stayed in the hotel to get ready for my special wedding day. 
When I arrived in the reception I was received with big smiles and a warm welcome by Felipe and Ester that promptly gave me the forms to sign in and my room keys and informed us that we had an upgrade.
I‚Äôve worked in a few hotels in Ireland, 4 and 5 stars so when I opened the room I was delighted with the decoration and all items available and with a Card, chocolate and champagne greeting us for the wedding! 
I was flattered and delighted by the care taken in the details. 
After the ceremony in the registry office and dinner in a restaurant we came back with his parents and our friends that were with us to the bar and again received with a warm welcome and greetings for the wedding by Lucia, Mario, Keith and Chris that served us excellently during the night making the day more special! 
Me and my husband were so happy with all staff and the amenities of the hotel mainly that comfy bed that we decided to book one more night and certainly was the best investment for our body and mind! 
I totally recommend this hotel for anyone and I was even thinking in ways of living here lol because it‚Äôs fantastic :) 
We‚Äôll certainly be back again. We live in Dublin and being here it made us feel as we were on Holidays! 
Thanks for all lovely staff from The Alex x 
Hope to see you again soon

215,"Amazing hotel, outstanding staff. Looking forward to my next visit!","This boutique hotel is stylish, comfortable, and convenient. I travel to Dublin on business often, and I'd honestly say The Alex is by far the best accommodation.

All staff that I came into contact with were extremely friendly and helpful. Notably Lucia, Felipe, and Amanda. 

I'm looking forward to my next visit.",5,2020,09,02
215,Beautiful hotel well worth the price,"Stayed for one night as a surprise birthday present to my husband. Felipe from reception was kind enough to send us a prosecco and couldn't have been more helpful, making our stay even more wonderful. The hotel followed covid19 protocols appropriately and everything was up to standards. Breakfast was perfect - loads of choices to avail from and served to the room in cute little picnic baskets. All in all a beautiful stay. My only complaint is I don't live in that suite!",5,2020,08,31
215,A fantastic stay,"We were to spend the first night of our honeymoon in the Alex hotel. Due to Covid, the wedding was postponed, but the Alex hotel very kindly moved our nonrefundable booking to another day of our choice. When we arrived, Felipe at the front desk was very friendly and accommodating. We went upstairs to see prosecco and Butlers chocolates - complimentary as our wedding was postponed. What a lovely touch! The hotel was very stylish, central to everything and the bed was so comfortable. We felt very safe with the coronavirus measures put in place, yet we were still able to relax and we didn't feel like we were missing out. Even with the coronavrius measures, there was a personal touch and the staff were still very approachable. We will definitely be returning.",5,2020,08,31
215,"Great location, nice staff",Hotel has been entirely renovated and is very pleasant to stay in - spacious rooms with all mod cons. Staff is friendly and efficient. Excellent breakfast and nothing is too much trouble. Felt that they had the covid 19 guidelines properly in place and that makes you feel safe. good job!,4,2020,08,31

215,Wonderful,"We booked a suite and rollaway beds for our 2 children, and were upgraded to an extra adjoining room with linking door. It was like an apartment. Tasteful decor and all our needs catered for. Really comfortable beds, very clean, and the service was excellent. Not too far from everything. Would definitely book again.",5,2020,08,28
215,The Alex ,"Had a fantastic overnight stay in the Alex on Monday 24th. Stayed in room 300, a suite which was amazing. It was our wedding anniversary and they left a little note and some lovely chocolates for us on arrival. The room was spotless and very quiet. The staff in the hotel are very professional and all wearing face masks as expected due to covid19. Location is fantastic just 10 minutes walk to grafton street and the car park is a mere 2 minute walk not located in the hotel. Ester was in reception as we left and again was very professional. Thank you for a wonderfull stay in very strange times. One very little downside was the poached egg in the morning was hard but everything else was perfect. ",5,2020,08,26
215,Best hotel experience ever,Stayed here for a surprise for my moms 50th and I have to say hands down it was the best experience from a hotel I‚Äôve ever had. They went beyond what I had expected and treated my mother and I like we were royalty. We felt like we were the only people in the hotel. The room was amazing and the bed was beyond comfortable.  The staff made the whole experience everyone was so brilliant making us feel like the only people in the hotel. First we met Felipe who was such a pleasure so sweet and professional and from the beginning to end of our stay we could not fault the place. I would highly recommend staying there again and this is all down to staff especially Felipe  and the decor.,5,2020,08,26
215,Excellent service and staff,"We stayed here from Friday 21st August to Sunday 23rd. 
The moment we arrived we where very warmly greeted by Filipe in reception. He was extremely friendly and was more than willing to help us with anything we needed. 
The rooms where extremely clean and beds super comfy.

We had dinner in the platform 41 terrace on Friday evening and that was wonderful. However I want to highlight the service I have got which was second to none by Mario in the bar. He was super friendly, kind and was going above and beyond for us on both nights we where there.
The experience we had in your hotel was exceptional and has set a standard others should follow. Your a credit to your management and staff and we will be staying here again with out a doubt when we are back in Dublin. 

Best service I‚Äôve experienced in a hotel in a long time. Highly recommended.",5,2020,08,26
215,Amazing,"Just want to say a massive thank you for making our anniversary extra special the customer service received was just amazing.
On our arrival Friday 21 Felipe welcome is with the biggest smile and made us feel at home he was just amazing, that evening we had dinner at the hotel and the food was just delicious and the service was once again amazing, Mario couldn‚Äôt do any more for us he was super friendly and professional at same time he really do an amazing job .
The room was super clean (everything was super clean) 
We got breakfast delivered to our room
The first night and the breakfast basket were an amazing touch . 
Honestly I can‚Äôt express my self enough how amazing this hotel is and the staff from
Felipe to mario to the night manager and staff everyone was just fantastic. On 23rd august at the check out when we went to finalise our bill we then found out the breakfast was Complimentary Too . We really couldn‚Äôt believe it.
Guys thank you so much for making our anniversary stay extra special can‚Äôt wait to get back . 
Your guys are simple the best ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2020,08,26
215,Great to be back,"Great to be back at The Alex! It‚Äôs been too long. Aldo very quiet, the hotel still is consistently good, ala carte breakfast was excellent. Covid measures were very evident but not in your face. We will be back soon.",5,2020,08,21
215,BRILLIANT PLACE TO STAY,This hotel is beautiful and up to a brilliant standard. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was large with a comfy bed and had a beautiful bathroom. I would definitely stay again and would recommend to any friends.,5,2020,08,21
215,Open and Welcoming,"The Alex Hotel is a beautifully appointed hotel with exceptional service in a central location. We enjoyed a spacious suite with great amenities as well as their restaurant and bar throughout our stay. If the weather is nice, be sure to sit on their gorgeous patio for a meal or drink! Thanks to General Manager,Paul Joy, who is the definition of hospitality. We will be back!",5,2020,08,20
215,The Alex,"We had originally booked The Davenport Hotel across the street, but as it remains closed our booking was transferred to The Alex amd I am delighted that it was. The hotel had only just reopened the day before our visit and was still very quiet, but I got the feeling that the staff were genuinely thrilled to serve customers.

The decor of the entire hotel is beautiful. Both my wife and I thought the room was espcially good. We liked the extra touches of a Nespresso machine and late 3pm checkout. I had thought that having an a la carte breakfast would be less satisfactory than a buffet, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The standard of service matched by the quality of the food and the coffee.

The local area is very attractive, Merrion Square is 2 minutes walk from the front door and so much of the surrounding area is very pleasant to walk around. There is a good variety of places to eat in all directions from the hotel. Places of note within 10 mins walk include Trinity College, St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street and Grand Canal Square.

We were delighted with our stay here, hipefully some day we will do it again. ",5,2020,08,13
215,"Great hotel, wonderful staff!","Our every need was attended to at the  beautiful Alex Hotel. Great breakfast and friendly attentive staff. Our visit was unfortunately timed with the corona virus city lockdown so we couldn't make the most of seeing the city, but the hotel was so comfortable we still had a lovely time. Thank you Caitlin and staff for taking such good care of us!",5,2020,03,15
215,Great hotel,"We had a great experience here. It's a great location, the bar service was excellent and the drinks the barman, Jose Paulo made were really good. Himself and Alessandro helped us on where to go in Dublin and looked after us well. I would definitely be back!",5,2020,03,13
215,"Stylish hotel, great for business",Enjoyed a nice stay at The Alex. All the right ingredients for a great business trip. Lovely coffee shop attached and nice Co-working space downstairs. Only negative was no bath tub in rooms. Apart from that I would highly recommend.,5,2020,03,11
215,Excellent Hotel,"Faultless stay. Art Deco style theme works really well throughout the Hotel. Very relaxed friendly atmosphere. Fittings and furniture were top quality. It looked an attractive hotel on their website but  I've booked Hotels before and feel cheated when the glossy pics don't reflect the actual place. Glad to say this hotel is better than the photos. Great location, a very enjoyable breakfast and large room size. Looking forward to staying here again. A real treat.",5,2020,03,09
215,Fab stay at stylish hotel ,"We arrived early on the day of our stay at The Alex Hotel and were greeted warmly by the team at Reception. To our dismay, they didn‚Äôt have a record of our booking‚Äîwe had used Travel Direct to book‚Äîbut with our booking reference, and giving my consent over the phone, Marta worked with the booking agency to understand what the issue was. She reassured us that she would get it sorted, and invited us to The Carriage Bar to have a drink. At the bar, we met the lovely Caitlin; Caitlin served us our wine and chatted with us, helping us to park our concern about the booking not being found immediately. Her conversation was a welcome distraction and I have to say, the wine was lovely‚Äîthey‚Äôve an expertly curated wine list. Marta returned to us shortly thereafter and told us it was all sorted, and completed check in. She was an absolute pleasure to deal with! 

First impressions of the hotel are really positive; the decor is impressive. I love the Art Deco styling in the lobby and in The Carriage Bar. The theme continues into the rooms. We stayed in 330, and fell in love with the interiors. The retro telephone and DAB radio were nice touches, as well as the Foxford wool throw on the bed. The linens were crisp white sheets and towels, and the toiletries were from Paul Costelloe (a conditioning shampoo, shower gel and body lotion). The bed was comfy and the storage space was more than adequate for our weekend break. The bathroom was beautifully styled, with a powerful overhead shower that had great pressure. 

We had breakfast the next morning. Caitlin greeted us cheerily as we entered The Carriage Bar and showed us to our booth. She asked how the concert we went to the night before had been, which was a nice touch; it showed she listened and was interested in what her customers had to say. She explained the buffet and how it worked, and highlighted the accompanying menu to order omelettes, pancakes, eggs benedict etc. The buffet had a selection of cereals, breads/pastries, juice and hot food (sausage, tomato, fried potato, bacon, eggs, black and white pudding, and beans). Everything was hot and fresh, and tasted amazing. We had juice and coffee, and the coffee was really good (so often an afterthought). Breakfast was very busy but it did not feel manic. 

We checked out before noon and skipped across the street to the parking to pick up the car. All in all, a very enjoyable, stay. 10/10‚Äîwould definitely stay at The Alex again. Cannot stress how great the customer service was‚Äîthanks to Marta, Caitlin and colleagues!

215,Service with a Smile!,"I've been going to the cafe shop in the Alex Hotel, Steam, for the last six months. The coffee is amazing and is always served with a smile, Amaya and Hajdi are a credit to the Alex! A great way to start the day, thank you. Ian",5,2020,03,04
215,Great location in city centre but with limited parking,Good location close to Trinity College and Merrion Square but with limited parking. Walking distance to Stephens Green/Grafton Street area. Ample function room space in basement. Contemporary look and feel.,4,2020,03,01
215,Fantastic hotel,"Myself and my wife are just back from our one night get away in Dublin this weekend and the highlight was definitely our stay in the Alex, from the moment we arrived to checkout the staff service was fantastic,very friendly and professional.We booked the executive double and we were informed that we had use of executive lounge were we enjoyed some complimentary drinks and nibbles(very nice touch) the food was delicious in the restaurant and in the morning, we were delighted with the variety and standard of the breakfast, we can cannot wait to return to this jem of a hotel. Thank you.",5,2020,03,01
215,Great coffee + awesome baristas,"I work across the road from the Alex and frequently pop in to buy coffee from Steam, the coffee shop. The two baristas Hajdi and Amaya do a top notch coffee and are delightful to have a chat with. Best coffee in the area.",5,2020,02,27
215,the bar,The food was good but the service off the waitress Margaret  was amazing 10/10 and I will be staying here again due to it this service. She kept making sure we were ok made us feel welcome and was berg friendly,5,2020,02,26
215,Stunning quality and comfort.,"My stay here was for one night only. It just wasn‚Äôt long enough. Everything was exactly how it looked on the website which believe me is quite often not the case. Oftentimes the reality is a poor tired reflection of the pristine pictures on the web.  
Everything in the room worked as it should. The LG hd television had all the channels. The bathroom had a walk in rainfall shower. And it was immaculately presented. 
The bedroom area was the same high quality and the bed was super comfortable.  Plenty of electrical outlets for laptops etc and they were conveniently placed. 
The WiFi was quick and easy to attach to. 
I just didn‚Äôt want to go home.",5,2020,02,23
215,Family weekend in Dublin,"Great family weekend at the Alex.  Lovely rooms, great breakfast and super attentive and helpful staff. Loredana went over and above to ensure we were happy. We had a suite and an adjoining room and couldn‚Äôt fault the set up. Location is 10-14 mins from pretty much all key central Dublin locations. Will be back for both family and work trips! ",5,2020,02,22
215,Super spot for business stay,Very comfortable hotel for business stay. Cool area to read/work in. Evening meal and breakfast were both excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. Lovely atmosphere overall in hotel. Will definitely be back when working in Dublin again.,5,2020,02,22
215,Weekend Break,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the Alex and what a fabulous hotel .The bedroom was fantastic the best shower I have ever experienced,Lovely modern hotel with a great choice for breakfast .The bar is lovely and spacious with plenty of choice of drinks and food.The hotel is in a great location and we will return in the near future.",5,2020,02,17
215,"Great hotel, don‚Äôt book the breakfast!","Great hotel, great location, comfy beds, well furnished and friendly staff. However, don‚Äôt book the breakfast, this really lets the hotel down. Carnage on both days we stayed, needs a front of house manager, to manage. Sat amongst dirty tables everywhere, in consistent availability of food, drinks, crockery etc. Not the experience you expect! ",3,2020,02,16
215,Great retro decor and spacious rooms in a central location,"Lovely breakfast, quiet room. Short walk to graft on street. Really excellent breakfast with lots of gluten free extras for ceoliacs I.e croissant, muffins, danish etc. I sampled the lot. The rooms are well equipped and spacious",5,2020,02,16
215,The Alex Bar,"Not only is the hotel spectacular, the bar at the Alex Hotel is wonderful. Be sure to look for Margaret who provides exceptional customer service & helped to make a work trip really wonderful! Highly recommend all aspects of the Alex fir business travelers!!",5,2020,02,12
215,Delightful ,Attended here for a pre-international talk in the Orient Room. Everything and everyone was excellent with good facilities. The lobby was small but pleasant with a coffee station and work desks where there was a student session going on. ,4,2020,02,08
215,"The hotel was amazing - the service at the check-in, not so much","The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are superb - perfect for attending a conference. I stayed here once before and absolutely enjoyed myself from start to finish, so I was very much looking forward to staying here again. However, at the check-in I was met with very little professionalism. There were three more senior people that I traveled with who all were treated very well, but I assume because of my younger age I was treated less than what I would expect from an establishment such as the Alex. It was minor things, like ignoring questions regarding the room accommodation i.e. twin beds and whether breakfast and wifi were available, but in comparison on how other guests who were all traveling with me are treated, I am not satisfied.",4,2020,02,07
215,Average Stay,"Hotel is in a great location that offers walking distance to many spots in the city. Lobby and rooms are very nice and clean. Based on the reviews, we were very excited to stay here, however, didn‚Äôt seem to have a similar experience as others. 
Majority of the staff we encountered didn‚Äôt seem interested or in a good mood. Breakfast buffet felt pricey for the quality of it. Our main issue was that there was an event (on the lower ground floor) that went until about 1:30am with very loud music. This is very frustrating when you‚Äôre trying to sleep and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a cutoff time for loud events. When we spoke with the front desk, they didn‚Äôt seem concerned. When we checked out, we weren‚Äôt asked how our stay went. Hotel itself is awesome, but what felt like a lack of customer service for the price we paid didn‚Äôt leave us with a great feeling.",3,2020,01,29
215,Perfect theatre stay,"Bord g√°is night, stayed here with my mom and it was so handy for pre theatre dinner off marion row followed by the show. The staff were super friendly and asked us how we were so often. Great breakfast and staff in the morning. Everything we needed and more on offer.",5,2020,01,27
215,Unforgettable Experience,"While in Dublin, the stay at The Alex was amazing, but the dinner was even better. The dining room was beautiful and clean and the staff was attentive and quick. I had the pleasure of being served by Jose. Due to being from out of the country, I wasn't sure of what to order or even what drinks I would like. I told him some of the drinks I enjoyed back at home and he helped me pick a delicious cocktail. For dinner, his recommendation did not disappoint. I enjoyed the beef brisket. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2020,01,16
215,Wonderful experience,"While in Dublin, the Alex Hotel was my home away from home. Angie and Cyril were such a delight when dining for breakfast. Business travel can be daunting but friendly hotel staff makes it memorable. I‚Äôll definitely return should work bring me back to Dublin.",5,2020,01,13
215,What a Spot!,"We stayed in The Alex for 1 night last Friday and I have to say it exceeded all my expectations.  We stayed in a gorgeous suite which was so spacious I would have loved to stay another few nights to really get the use of it.  The staff were all so welcoming, from the girls on check in to the lovely team in the bar where we had a lovely dinner before heading out.  It's good staff that really make a hotel stand out and The Alex has this in spades! We'll definitely be back soon!!",5,2020,01,12
215,Fabulous Hotel,"Gorgeous hotel, fabulous rooms with amazingly comfortable beds! Decor stunning something interesting around every corner. Bar is lovely had a very tasty meal there before the gig. Cannot wait to return and next time will be longer!",5,2020,01,12
215,Last night in Ireland,"Well appointed hotel close to National Gallery, Grafton Street and 10 minutes walk from Temple Bar and Dublin Castle. Large room (King Room) with good quality facilities. Parking is available, but is 100m from hotel (overnight cost Euro 15). Suggest you drop bags at the door before you park (Care: a pass-code is required). VG breakfast",4,2020,01,09
215,Stunning,"We stayed here for two beautiful nights. Ah, this place is class. Gorgeous decor with a hint of a 60‚Äôs vibe. The beds are so comfy and the breakfast was quite delightful. This is a special place. Romantic and stylish. Staff really friendly and smiley and we will be back.",5,2020,01,02
215,Great location and hotel!,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Alex as a ‚Äòmini moon‚Äô, from start to finish it was an excellent stay.

When we first checked in and entered our room the hotel left us a plate of chocolate cake and a congratulations card on our marriage - this was such a nice touch!

We booked an executive room so had access to the executive lounge which was a stylish lounge where you could have complimentary drinks and snacks - including wine, beer, tea/coffee plus lots of sweet snacks - this was definitely worth paying extra for.

The hotel room itself was beautiful, comfortable bed and super stylish decor - we couldn‚Äôt ask for more.

The breakfast was good - it had a choice of cooked breakfast, pastries, fruit etc. The only thing I would say is that because if was a buffet style breakfast the food went cold really quickly especially the baked beans.

The location is fantastic, a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar and there are lots of Hop on Hop off bus stops close by. You can purchase tickets to this through reception which was great! 

You can also purchase tickets through reception for the Airport Express bus (‚Ç¨7 each) and the stop is just around the corner.

Overall we had a fantastic stay and would definitely return.",4,2020,01,02
215,Gorgeous little hotel--lacking in a few amenities,"Love the rooms--very comfortable, large and posh.  Cute built-ins for closet area and bed frame.  Also, love the added touch of the water in a large glass bottle.  Elevators are very speedy too!  I did find it a little funny there weren't any staff that worked the doors/taxis.  The staff at the front desk had to deal with those types of issues, and it was a little inefficient (for instance, my taxi was stolen away from me by another hotel guest).

I'd recommend the breakfast at The Monte over The Alex, and the gym at The Monte is pretty great too.  I just wish The Alex had a little gym at least.",4,2020,01,02
215,Fantastic stay,"Great location and a stress free hotel. It‚Äôs quiet, clean and sophisticated with very attentive staff throughout. We stayed for new year and we can‚Äôt wait to go back. It‚Äôs a 10 minute walk into the centre which is just right. Would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2020,01,02
215,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed for two nights in December and it was lovely. The bed was super comfortable, the shower was great, the room was nice and quiet, which was unexpected considering how busy the hotel was. The location is great, though we utilized the city bus quite a lot so I'm not sure how much is very close by. Breakfast was good, the coffee was the best we had in Ireland (something these Americans found sorely lacking through the country). The restaurant service is incredibly slow. Not sure if they are understaffed or just not trained well. Front desk staff was super helpful and friendly.",5,2019,12,22
215,Excellent stay,"One of an emergjng range of modern hotels, the Alex was exceptional.  Rooms well appointed and well designed, good facilities, excellent welcoming staff, and a great location just 10 mins walk from the great bars od Baggot Street. 

Breakfast was well presented, the whole plac was clean and hospitable, and we will be back!",5,2019,12,21
215,The Alex,"Great location. Excellent beds, nice showers, excellent breakfast, VERY HELPFUL STAFF: Anissa at the front desk and Leslie at the bar were very helpful and conscientious with helping my wife who was under the weather at the time. Thx much!",5,2019,12,20
215,5 STAR HOTEL - BY FAR THE BEST HOTEL I HAVE STAYED IN DUBLIN,"What a fantastic experience from start to finish. 

The room was spacious and very clean. 
All staff went the extra yard to make me feel welcome and assisted me with my plans for Dublin. 

I came down to a lovely breakfast with a wide variety. 

It was a quick walk to all locations required.",5,2019,12,20
215,LOVED IT!,"Beautiful charming cozy hotel and amazing staff. I arrived early and Vjeko went out of his way to get me a room, explain the hotel amenities and made sure I was absolutely satisfied!! Beautiful bathroom, super comfortable bed and sheets, super clean. The restaurants food was also phenomenal. 

great experience, great staff, I will be returning back!",5,2019,12,19
215,Made our trip!,"I must say I was disappointed with Dublin. Unless you love whiskey and Guinness then there‚Äôs not a lot else to do. The shopping is good but not great for couples, I‚Äôd imagine with friends there‚Äôs more to do. The fabulousness of the hotel saved our 3 day weekend. The Alex has a great first impression, the staff are welcoming and friendly and really do go above and beyond to get you the exact room for your needs and expectations. The room looks exactly like the pictures, stylish and cool. Most important for me is heating, plugs, lighting, and a clean and functional bathroom. This room has everything and more. Loads of hangers, mirrors, amazing bathroom and whatever temperature you want it. Oh and the bed is so comfortable, very soft but very large and comfy. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. ",5,2019,12,16
215,Helpful staff and nice hotel,"Stayed in the hotel for the first time this week and found the staff to be very polite and friendly.
Although they were very busy as it is expected during this month, they did their outmost to provide a good service.
Hotel is modern, clean and was in a good area for my needs. ",5,2019,12,15
215,Employee went above & beyond!,"To make it short; Someone took my phone by mistake during the Company Christmas party and while I was looking for it and talking with all the employees inside the venue and asking for help, Ana (short lady, brown hair and dark frame glasses) approached me and offered her mobile to ring my number. As it wasn't enough, she located on the gps locator (with my consent) and only because of her I could get my phone back. Ana, thank you very much! Despite the unpleasant situation, you did help me a lot like all the team during the night! She definitively went above and beyond! Well done and never stop helping others. :)",5,2019,12,13
215,Fantastic hotel centrally located ,Staff are polite and friendly and location of the property was very good. Hotel is modern and stylish and has a fresh vibe.This was my second stay at the  hotel and will definitely return each time I will have the opportunity ,5,2019,12,12
215,Grand!,"Fantastic hotel- sleek, chic and modern hotel centrally located in the city. The Airlink 757 bus from the airport stops at the Davenport Hotel, and The Alex is a few steps away. Easily able to walk to popular attractions. Safe and quiet area, friendly and helpful staff. Check-in was swift. Spacious and very tidy room. Breakfast was included in my booking and it was good. 100% would stay at again, 100% would recommend.",5,2019,12,09
215,Lovely Staff & Super Marathon Convenient!!,"The team at the hotel was lovely and full of suggestions on favorite restaurants and sites to take in.  Additionally, it is very close to the marathon finish line so I could hobble back for a shower and a nap after completing my race! :)",5,2019,11,30
215,Great Hotel,Very clean rooms and well situated in Dublin.  Staff were very helpful and efficient.  Would stay there again when visiting Dublin.  Rooms had lots of space and the beds were very comfortable.    10 minute walk to the main streets of Dublin.,5,2019,11,22
215,Quick Stop - Top Notch!,"Stayed on an brief visit to Dublin. Ideally located for doing business in the city, would highly recommend. Check in was seamless, rooms are sort of 'art deco' style and very comfortable. The food in the bar was quick and tasty with a very prompt service.Hard to fault any aspect, well done|!",5,2019,11,22
215,Quiet comfortable stay with all the amenities and value,"We stayed for three nights and when our flight cancelled there was no decision to make on where to stay, we came back to The Alex. Our first stay we had the Alex Suite 200 and first concerned about noise on the second floor and all the windows. We didn't hear any street noise at all. So when we returned we booked another suite and were in Suite 300 and it was as lovely as suite 200. The staff is excellent, friendly and helpful in every way. When we come to Dublin again there is no decision where we will stay, again, The Alex!!!!",5,2019,11,20
215,"Friendly, good location, great food and nice rooms","I was in Dublin for a week on business and had chosen this hotel as it had a great looking gym and I found a good deal on a room. I was really nicely surprised to see it had a beautiful interior and the room was really nice. I had a room facing the road on the third floor so I had somewhat of a view but that didn't really matter to me. The gym was in a neighbouring hotel - The Mont, which was just around the corner but it's brand new and a good size so I was happy to make the 2 minute walk to it. 

The staff at The Alex are very friendly and happy to engage in conversation if you want it. The food is really nice though I'd like to see more Irish brands on the beer pumps. There's a wonderful pub next door called The Ginger Man that I visited a number of times that had some great beers to try. Breakfast in the restaurant in the morning was good though I think getting the eggs out the kitchen could have been faster. 

Location wise, the hotel is about a 15 minute walk past the university from the main shopping area and the famous Temple Bar area. It's very close to a number of free entry museums and the hop-on/hop off buses stop. It's close to a train station and there's a number of places to get food to take out or eat in around the hotel if you fancy a change. There's a Tesco around the corner about 10 minutes walk away for anything you need. 

This was a business trip but my wife joined me on the Friday for the weekend and we explored much of Dublin. Look out for The Dublin Pass ticket that allows you access to a whole range of activities and things to see as well as the hop on/hop off buses, which was a great way to get around.",5,2019,11,18
215,Stayed here with my Canadian Sister 2019,"This is one boutique hotel you WANT to stay at. This has all the comfoand luxurious furnishings ever and they have some amazing irish designer art work that will make your mind blow! I would say the stay here is fantastic. You get the best service too and they are so friendly and helpful. We just had a blast here. I'd recommend everyone to come here for cocktails too... tasty! They do Alcohol zero beer also;) For those who don't want to drink alcohol. What a fab fab hotel! Super clean, really enjoyable stay. ",5,2019,11,15
215,Nice Hotel in a Great Location,"The hotel, and it's rooms are modern, clean and quiet.  We were able to find a place to park our rental car (for a fee) close by.  The location of the hotel is quite good as it's in walking distance to the Temple Bar area as well as there being quite a few bars and restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood.  The Alex is not memorable in any specific regard but fits the bill for a decent place to stay for the night.",4,2019,11,14
215,Great location for a night on the town!,"Couldn't fault our recent stay, room was fab, spacious with a huge comfy bed and plenty of lovely touches to make you feel welcome. Its central location was perfect - only a short walk back to the hotel after a night on the town! Staff were all lovely- friendly and efficient. Hotel was spotless, very stylish decor and would only love another nights stay soon.

",5,2019,11,11
215,Fantastic Hotel & Fantastic Lcoation,"Stayed in this lovely hotel for my 40th birthday with my family. 

There was 9 of us in total and we all left happy with out stay.

Hotel location was ideal and close by traditional Irish pubs. 

The hotel seems to be recently refurbished and the rooms were really comfortable and modern. 

I have to say I dont have anything negative to say. Breakfast the next morning hit the spot and the employees were friendly and helpful. 

I would 100% recommend this hotel for a short or long stay.",5,2019,11,11
215,Fantastic Relaxing Experience,Myself and my husband stayed for a night at The Alex in August.  We were off a longhaul flight from New Zealand and wanted somewhere calm to chill out before our onward trip.  We availed of the well stocked executive room to catch up on work.  The staff were so pleasant and easy to deal with.  5 star Irish hospitality.  Breakfast was really good.  there was just enough choice and the food quality was excellent.  We will be staying here again for sure.,5,2019,11,10
215,Dublin Marathon ,"Stayed for two nights while running in the Dublin Marathon owing to its proximity to start/ finish , Although the two sister hotels are metres away from it we thought we would choose the Alex due to the look of it ... we got the 757 bus from Dublin airport and it stopped metres away in Merrion square , 
Check in was quick with a pleasant staff member , and soon we were in our room on the first floor ,  the room was fantastic , I cannot fault it ....  we ate local on the first night  around the corner at Cafe Di Napoli ,  nice pasta meal , to help me the next day .... the only problem I would say was I had trouble getting out of bed .... it was so comfy ! It was lovely look out of the window and see runners arriving to the event knowing I had plenty of time  to keep warm in the hotel before heading  round the block to the marathon bag drop , I didn‚Äôt have breakfast in the hotel on this day , 
Marathon completed ... had a bit of a longer walk back to the hotel due to the way they route finishers , had food in the Restaurant along with a well earned pint ! The hotel was very busy at this point but cheerful staff and a happy marathon finishers vibe to everyone there ...food was lovely ( as was the Guinness )  then I headed up for a lovely shower ... ( I think baths are available in bigger rooms ? 
Another early night and a fantastic nights sleep , followed by a lovely buffet breakfast , then a short walk to the 757 bus stop in Clare street and back to the airport  , worth the money to be so close to the marathon start finish ,  but very central if you were just visiting Dublin , nice pub next door but it was a bit too busy when we looked in ,  thank you to all the staff at the Alex , I better book it it soon for next year ! 
",5,2019,11,06
215,Great Hotel and Great Service.,"Marta on reception is the best
I left my passport in my room safe after I checked out and she called me to let me know. Saved me from missing my flight. Thanks Marta.

Aside from that, the hotel is lovely.

Rooms are spacious and comfortable..
Very boutique feel. Slick operation 
+ The towels smelt amazing (random but true)

Will definitely stay here again next time in Dublin",5,2019,11,06
215,Pleasantly disappointed ! ,"I was booked in to stay last night for business. Last minute my work plans changed and I contacted the hotel to see if I could amend my booking from Sunday night to Monday night. Reception immediately checked the cancellation policy and when that didn‚Äôt stipulate amendments, they said they‚Äôd clarify the cancellation policy and get back to me. The hotel had rooms available last night and tonight so the change could have been easily facilitated but the language used suggested that wouldn‚Äôt be happening. They called back stating because I‚Äôd used a booking agent they couldn‚Äôt do anything. I have used the same booking agent hundreds of times and on the rare occasion I‚Äôve had to make a change out of hours directly with a hotel, it‚Äôs never been an issue with other hotels. It felt a case of ‚Äúcomputer says no‚Äù. So, rather than waste e170 I continued as planned and checked in. 

Furious at the lack of customer service to a simple request, I was ready to scrutinise any issue ! And that‚Äôs where I really got frustrated. Check-in was seamless and friendly, the room was gorgeous, great location and one of the best hotel breakfasts I‚Äôve had in a longtime. I could find no fault! 

I‚Äôd consider staying here again but I‚Äôd recommend the management look at improving some aspects of customer service training. A simple request that can be facilitated with no cost impact should be easily done to encourage repeat business.

",4,2019,11,04
215,Great Location Great Style,"Lovely big stylish rooms, with very comfy beds. Helpful staff and central location for shops, sightseeing and transport.
Room lighting could be better (not easy to dry hair and apply make up) and a few extra's like a towelling robe would give it 5* status.
Food choice in restaurant limited.
Would definitely stay there again when next in Dublin.",4,2019,11,04
215,Amazing Hotel,"Loved this hotel. 20mins from the airport, smooth checkin, recently renovated, oozing style, super comfy bed! We had a great 2 night stay and couldn‚Äôt really fault anything about our experience. Until next time. ",5,2019,11,03
215,"Large rooms, great location and staff that go the extra mile","Spent 2 nights at the Alex and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is modern and has a nice lobby area and bar.  We booked the smallest room there is and it was huge - the bed was big and comfortable too. I selpt so well. The bathroom was well equipped and the toiletries smelt amazing.

Breakfast is served in the bar/restuarant which is really nicely done. The breakfast buffet offering was a bit sparse (but the sausages were delish). The menu for kitchen orders wasn't put on the table on the Saturday morning so we had no idea there was one til the next day, which was dissapointing as there were quite a few tempting items on the menu.

We'd booked our stay through Mr & Mrs Smith so were given two free cocktails and were supposed to be given truffles on arrival. Unfortunately these had run out so I was provided with a huge plate of desserts instead (2 portions of 3 different items). I'm allergic to nuts and so went down to see what had nuts in. One of the chefs, Adam, came and had a chat and dissapeared to tell me what I could eat, returning with nut free desserts! Now that is service. All other staff were really friendly and helpful too.

The location of the hotel is excellent - its about 10 mins from Grafton Street and Trinity College and 15 minutes to Temple Bar.

All in all an excellent stay. I would definitely stay at the Alex again.",5,2019,10,31
215,Amazing place,"Staying in the Alex was exceptional, room was perfect, staff were amazing not much more I can say to be honest. Breakfast buffet hit the spot after a hard days work and a hard night. Highly recommend a stay in the Alex.",5,2019,10,29
215,Fabulous,"What a delight, great hotel.ideal for exploring Dublin on foot.
Great staff and so helpful as we.arrived at 8am expecting to leave our luggage until check in only to be offered our room early at no extra cost.
Had a great  couple of nights in the hotel, beautifully appointed room and very comfortable. Thank you ",5,2019,10,29
215,Excellent city centre location without the noise,"Stayed one night in Hotel and wished it was more. Huge comfortable bed and had a great nights sleep. Hotel is located on a quiet street walking distance from Grafton St.  Room was big with writing desk and comfortable seating. 

Staff were very friendly and professional. We stayed during Dublin City Marathon and the hotel was extremely busy but staff seemed unfazed couldn't do enough for us.  We will be back.",5,2019,10,28
215,DUBLIN CITY MARATHON,Huge Thank-you to Paul Joy and his wonderfully helpful and friendly staff at The Alex for making our experience very relaxing and enjoyable.  Highly recommend this hotel in the heart of Dublin.  Nicky and Pauline Browne.,5,2019,10,28
215,Casual and contemporary,"The immediate vicinity of this newly renovated hotel is not particularly appealing or attractive, but it‚Äôs actually pretty well located, being close to Merrion Square and Trinity College. In fact, we were able to walk to most of the major tourist sites from here. The decor is very modern, colourful and stylish, and our room (an Executive King) was clean, comfortable and tastefully appointed. I do have a criticism of the bathroom though: there are no hooks to hang wet towels so that they can dry overnight. I mean seriously, why not?  Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, but I didn‚Äôt find the restaurant staff particularly efficient or attentive. Overall though, this is a nice hotel and I would recommend it. ",4,2019,10,22
215,Great stay ,Stayed here for two nights a few weekends ago. Great hotel and very centrally located. Every staff member we seen greeted us with a warm smile. Receptionist was lovely and very helpful and nothing was too big of an ask. Will definitely be back. ,5,2019,10,18
215,Exceptional Staff...,"This hotel in general is very clean and centrally located. What topped the list for me though is the amazing customer service. The staff at the front desk were very accommodating with a special request I made with regard to my receipt. Also, I‚Äôve stayed in many hotels in my career, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met a member of hotel staff as cheerful and genuinely glad to see me as Karina who so enthusiastically greeted me in the restaurant on the final morning of my stay. Incidentally, I f you are a coffee drinker, you will love the quality and amount of coffee served as part of your breakfast.  
I would definitely stay here again whenever business or personal life takes me back to Dublin.",5,2019,10,16
215,Great Stay,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip - we had one regular room and then stayed in the suite the last night. We really enjoyed our stay! The hotel is so cool and has a good vibe. 

We arrived in the morning and they had our room ready which I appreciated so much because we were with our baby - we really needed a place to rest after a long flight. I requested a crib but didn‚Äôt end up using it because our baby wouldn‚Äôt sleep in it - we ended up having the baby sleep in bed with us, which was fine and the beds are so big there was plenty of room!

Both rooms were really comfortable and clean. At night it was really dark and quiet so we slept really well. The suite was really spacious and comfortable. The bathtub was so nice!

The restaurant is cool and breakfast was good. There‚Äôs also a coffee shop where you can get more types of drinks. 

The staff was really nice. Before we arrived they helped me arrange transportation to and from the airport and it worked perfectly. 

The only thing is that you can‚Äôt order room service until 10pm. But we just went down to the restaurant to eat. 

",5,2019,10,16
215,Best Hotel I have EVER stayed at,"I was on the 1st floor, and from the entrance to the amenities my experience at The Alex was top-notch.  The room was absolutely spotless (I did not see one speck of dust anywhere). The furnishings were gorgeous, well appointed without being fussy. The lighting in the room was spectacular. The well-designed headboard with cubbies for your necessities was inspirational. The bathroom was sleek and luxurious. The service at this hotel was exceptional. Every person we met was pleased to see us and delivered superior customer service. I would recommend this hotel to anyone -- from business travelers to vacationers. The location is great, and as mentioned the service is unmatched. Well well done.",5,2019,10,14
215,Our stay at The Alex,"It was a lovely, clean hotel with very friendly, helpful front desk staff. The breakfast was delicious. The location was terrific to get around Dublin, with a stop for the Hop On Hop Off bus right around the corner. Merrion Square was 2 blocks away and we walked to the museums, restaurants, and Trinity College. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",5,2019,10,14
215,Perfect hotel in central Dublin,"Hotel location is very close to central Dublin's St Stephens Green, Temple Bar and O'Connell Street destinations.  We appreciated that it wasn't on a busy street (relatively speaking, most parts we explored in the city have heavy foot and motor traffic) and the immediate surrounding area was a little quieter.  The staff were welcoming and very attentive.  The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable (we stayed in an executive King room).  Our only criticism was the service in the restaurant was on the slow side, though the food and drink were delicious.",5,2019,10,13
215,Perfect spot in the Capital,"Headed up to Dublin for the weekend and had a ball. Staff were excellent in the Alex, we felt very welcome on from the moment we landed and it‚Äôs location was excellent, perfect for exploring the city. 

Food in both the Bar and especially at breakfast was fantastic. I would highly recommended we will be booking again in the future.",5,2019,10,13
215,"Great hotel, perfect location","I've stayed at The Alex twice and both times were really good. The location is fantastic, the rooms are tastefully decorated, the breakfast was also good. I'd also like to commend the staff, especially those at the Reception, very helpful and always made me feel very welcome. I'd like to especially thank Rebecca for her great service and support given when needed!",4,2019,10,11
215,"Lovely hotel, good location","The hotel is within easy walking distance to the centre of Dublin and is close to some nice restaurants and bars. 
The decor is very stylish and the rooms are well thought out. Everywhere is spotlessly clean - in fact, we‚Äôve stayed at some excellent hotels all over the world and I can honestly say this is the cleanest one we‚Äôve ever stayed in. The staff deserve a lot of credit.
All in all, a lovely stay and we‚Äôd certainly come again.",5,2019,10,10
215,Perfect location. Great room!,We had a great stay at The Alex. Our flight got us in early but they had a room ready for us when we got there.

The breakfast each morning was top notch!,5,2019,10,02
215,Nando‚Äôs Conference ,"Great location. Great staff. Great rooms. Great breakfast. The Alex is in a great location, close to many of Dublin‚Äôs sites. Staff are friendly, helpful and efficient. The hotel is pleasant, clean and comfortable. Room was well maintained and appointed. Only issue was the air conditioning. Breakfast was excellent.

",5,2019,10,01
215,Great location - Great hotel,Wonderful stay.  The room was ready upon very early arrival.  Breakfast (Buffet!) was included and we stayed on the Executive floor which had access to free snacks and drinks.  Excellent stay.  There was a big convention in the hotel and it was not disruptive in the slightest.  They manage the hotel very well.  I had a small issue and it was corrected in minutes.,5,2019,09,27
215,Class act,"Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. Friendly staff. Really happy with the room, beautiful retro touches and quality finishes. Comfortable bed, blackout curtains and quiet. Buffet style breakfast was decent and taken in a very nicely designed dining room. Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,09,27
215,Great location,The Alex was a wonderful stay. We were there 2 nights. The hotel was bright and clean.  The desk was very helpful to us. We had breakfast included and it was very good. The hotel was in a great spot for getting around. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,09,25

215,Great location & experience at The Alex,"Having stayed here many years ago, and indeed their other two hotels near by, it was with interest that we stayed here again after the refit. Glad we did, the whole break (5 of us in total, 3 rooms) had a great time. The Exec rooms even had their own lounge so that was good to get away from it all. The hotel is in a great location and we enjoyed the whole experience, food, staff,etc .... will certainly look to use again when next in Dublin.",5,2019,09,24
215,Wonderful and Accommodating Staff at The Alex!,"I had had plans to visit Dublin this past summer and had made reservations at The Alex, per a recommendation from a local contact who highly recommended the hotel. While I unfortunately had to cancel my trip last minute, I cannot say enough good things about the staff at The Alex, including the General Manager leading up to my stay. The General Manager in particular, Paul, went above and beyond to provide hands-on support and guidance prior to my trip, including offering personalized recommendations for attractions and tours to check out during my trip and accommodating my request for a room in a quiet part of the hotel. Furthermore, The Alex offered me a wonderful package for what would have been my 5-night stay at the hotel. I was so touched by how caring, gracious and accommodating Paul and his team were while I was planning my trip. They were also very understanding when my plans unexpectedly changed last minute.

When I do eventually visit Dublin, I will most definitely be staying at The Alex!",5,2019,09,22
215,Great place,"This was our first visit to Ireland and we were so happy we picked The Alex to stay at.  The location is perfect, close to everything but a quiet city neighborhood!!  The on-site restaurant is great, including the bar!! The staff was the best, easy check in and out.  They were always there to help with directions and suggestions!!  If you are leaving early for a tour they will have a food/water bag for you!",5,2019,09,20

very clean and well apppointed. Staff were efficient and friendly. Breakfast
was top notch. We had access to the executive lounge which was a nice
added touch. Great bed & pillows.",5,2019,09,16
215,"Terrific Hotel, Staff, Location","About 10 of us from the States stayed here on a combined business and leisure trip.  Everything was terrific.

The front desk staff is delightful and accommodating and there to meet your every request.

The guest rooms are nicely appointed and were very clean.

The breakfast offering has something for everyone and the bar staff in the evening was pleasant and happy to serve.

Our catered lunch was done exactly how we hoped. Frederick ensure that every detail was accounted for and visible throughout.  Ailee was happy to work with us and the culinary team to meet our request for an ‚ÄúAmerican-type‚Äù menu and the lunch was perfect.

General Manager Paul Joy was visible, engaged and delightful as well.  We communicate A LOT prior to our visit and he also met every request.

The location is an easy walk to shopping, Trinity College, the double-Decker buses and the Temple Bar District.

We will absolutely will stay here every time we visit Dublin for business or pleasure.",5,2019,09,15
215,Convenient Location,"Very nice recently updated hotel.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Good bar service and restaurant.  No ice machine on floors.  Must pick up ice from the bar.  Should have more towels for bathroom.  Good location,close to bus line and away from most tourist
traffic.",4,2019,09,14
215,Fun hotel with cool vibe and decor,"Love this hotel.  Super friendly staff, great style, and nice rooms with cool furniture and comfortable bed.  Feels trendy and hip, in a good way.  Fun pub is right next door as well.  While at the edge of town, great starting point for walking around the city.  We had access to the executive lounge on the 6th floor, which was great (complimentary snacks, wine, beer, soda).  Worth every penny.",5,2019,09,12
215,Meh ‚Äî about average,"This property is pretty nice.  

The only issues we had were:
A)  There was only a single towel in the room, so I had to go downstairs to ask for more towels and a washcloth.  Not every hotel supplies washcloths, so I can see past that.  But to only provide a single bath towel?

B) By far the bigger issue was the temperature in the room - it was really stuffy when we arrived.  When I turned the air conditioner on, it was set at 18*C (about 64*F).  I gave it a couple of hours to start cooling the room down, and when it was abundantly clear that the ~78*F was the best it would do, I opened a window in the hopes that that would help.  I told the ladies behind the front desk, and I asked for a fan (my wife has the flashes common to a woman ‚Äúof a certain age‚Äù).  I was told that they had given them all out, and that I must close our room window for the air to cool down.  She didn‚Äôt seem to hear me when I told her that I waited a couple of hours before trying the window.  

Bottom line:  We are very unlikely to stay here again.  Not only does the A/C not work properly, but the desk clerk tried to blame me for it - and she stopped just shy of calling me a liar when I told her that it wasn‚Äôt cooling.

There are too many hotels in Dublin to spend the night sweating...",3,2019,09,11
215,Good hotel for Dublin,"I would recommend the Alex Hotel in Dublin. It was a good value, great location, but not too close to the tourist rush. The train station was a 3 minute walk. (We took a delightful hike and separate day at Howth, a very easy half hour train excursion). The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would particularly mention Rebecca, who helped us book our trip to Howth and helped us make several calls to France over an upcoming trip. She was very helpful and professional in every way. The rooms were clean and very stylish, although our room's shower drain was very slow. Overall, I would highly recommend the Alex Hotel in Dublin.",4,2019,09,10
215,Middle of the road,We found this hotel to be very average.  The free Breakfast was just a step above an American holiday inn.  The small pour drinks in the bar were ridiculously expensive and pathetically weak.  Overall it was clean and neat but nothing special. And do they really have to only offer lukewarm  showers ?,3,2019,09,10
215,Great Start to Our Ireland Tour,"This hotel was the first on our Rick Steves Tour. Accomidations, food and staff were excellent. They were nice enough to let us check in at 10am when we arrived from the airport. Desk staff was very friendly. Easy walking distance to many Dublin interesting destinations.",5,2019,09,10
215,Wonderful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great location...lots in walking distance.   The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Front desk clerks, Hevandro and Loredana, are exceptional!  They are friendly and helpful.  Breakfast is superb....hope to come back! ",5,2019,09,09
215,2 night weekend stay,Our second visit to this lovely hotel the staff exceeded our expectations nothing was too much trouble  the service was second to none and the rooms were an excellent standard I would highly recommend this hotel,5,2019,09,09
215,Superb Spot to Enjoy Dublin,An elegant hotel in a perfect place to enjoy Dublin. The rooms are super comfortable and the staff are terrific from reception to the restaurant/bar. The breakfast buffet satisfied every desire to start the day; and we enjoyed a late dinner after much sightseeing. Highly recommended.,5,2019,09,09
215,Fantastic hotel with outstanding staff!,"My family and I just spent 10 nights at this hotel and we felt so welcomed and comfortable here, we started referring to it as our ""home"".

Location: The hotel is within walking distance to almost all major attractions in Dublin, yet far enough away from the hustle and bustle of tourists.  It is literally a block from Trinity College, couple of blocks from Merrion Square, walking distance to Grafton St area and to St Stephen's Green.  Hop on Hop off buses and Airlink buses are also close by, as is the Pearse Stn of DART (train).  You can't ask for a better location.

Staff:  The hotel staff is its biggest asset!  Everyone we encountered were friendly, helpful and kind.  We came to Dublin to help our daughter move into her new apt as she is starting studies at Trinity.  Therefore, we had a ton of luggage when we arrived for check in.  Loredana, the Front Desk Manager (I think), came out to greet us right away and brought the luggage cart with her.  She helped with all our luggages (all 14 pieces!!) and checked us in right away.  To our relief, our room was ready for us even though we arrived at noon, hours before the check in time.  This early check in was really appreciated as we had flown all night from Canada and were very tired. She showed us to our room and we were very grateful that we could freshen up and rest, without having to wait for the usual check in time.  When Loredana found out that we were relocating our daughter from Canada to Dublin for school, she gave us a lot of useful tips as to where to purchase things for her apt and how the transit system worked etc.  We were very appreciative and definitely took her advice on quite a few things.  Throughout our stay, she would ask how things were going with the move and if we needed anything.  This personalized service was very much appreciated.  Other staff we encountered at the Front Desk were also very kind and helpful.

The Room: we had an Executive King and it was a very large room, not only by European standards but also by North American standards.  We had a king bed and also a cot for a few nights and there was still room to move around.  It was big enough to hold all 14 pieces of our luggage!  The bed was VERY comfortable and the thick, soft, light duvet was lovely, esp for cool Dublin nights.  The AC was a bit fussy, sometimes turning itself off after a while but we found that we actually preferred sleeping with the window open for fresh air.

The room had lots of storage space, a coffee station and a mini fridge.  You get bottled water and coffee, tea and cookies everyday.  We also got a lovely bottle of Proseco and chocolate brownie dessert as a welcome gift!  How thoughtful!  In addition, we got access to the Executive Lounge, which provided drinks, snacks and fruit, which was very handy.  There was a large work desk in the room with lots of plug ins.  There was also room for an armchair and a coffee table.  I really liked the bedside cubbies with plug ins where you can put your phone etc.  Everything was designed with a purpose in mind and it was really well thought out.

The bathroom had a really nice rain shower with good water pressure.

Housekeeping does a pretty good job cleaning the room.  The bed linens and towels were hair-free.

There is a cafe on the main floor where you can grab a coffee, breakfast or snack.  There's a bar/restaurant also and the food was pretty good.

The hotel itself doesn't have a gym BUT you get to use the huge gym across the street at The Mont (also owned by the O'Callahan group), which is open 24/7 and is free for guests of The Alex.

All in all, this is a GREAT hotel with comfortable rooms, fantastic staff, great location and extremely reasonably priced for the quality you get.  We will be visiting Dublin many times over the next 5 years as our daughter studies at Trinity and we will definitely be staying at The Alex for all these future trips.  You can't go wrong with this hotel.  We have stayed at others in the city, and paid a lot more, and didn't get nearly as good a service as we got at The Alex.

Well done to the entire staff!",5,2019,09,07
215,"Great hotel, highly recommended","Just back from a great weekend in Dublin. We stayed in the Alex following a recommendation from a friend. Hotel was perfect, good location, really friendly staff, nice bar area and reasonably priced vs others in the area. Give this hotel a try, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",5,2019,09,07
215,"Great hotel, very close to the city center","For a short stay in Ireland, we chose the Alex because of its location. The staff is friendly, service is prompt and the hotel is very clean. The hotel is close to the city center and yet one can enjoy one‚Äòs good night sleep as the rooms are comfy and cancel noise.",5,2019,09,07
215,Modern clean convenient,"I loved this place . It‚Äôs a bit off the main streets but that makes it even better because it‚Äôs in a quiet spot. But within 5 -10 minutes walk you are exactly in the middle of everything. 3 min away you are the National Gallery which was the best part of my stay. It‚Äôs very modern, very clean and spacious . Very friendly staff. I was very happy with my stay . Next time I go to Dublin I will stay there again .",5,2019,09,04
215,Great hotel in a great location in Dublin,"Spent 3 nights here in August, 2019. It was a lovely hotel with nice lobby and very helpful staff at the front desk. The only drawback was the street that it was located on was run down. But it was just one street off a main road, a few blocks from Trinity College and lots of great restaurants in all price ranges. 
The lobby bar/restaurant was nice to have a drink in. We sat there for quiet a while visiting with relatives who I have not seen in years. The staff was very very gracious and did not rush us at all. We ate breakfast at the hotel the morning after we arrived because we were tired and did not want to search for a place but after one day in the city we found out that  there are lots of very nice options just a few minutes walk. We took the bus to the airport and the staff were able to sell us a ticket and it was just a 5 minute walk to the stop. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit. ",5,2019,09,03
215,"Stunning, stylish, and perfect night's sleep.","My boyfriend and I went on a roadtrip all over Ireland and I can easily say that out of the 8 places we stayed, the Alex was by far the best. We absolutely loved the modern decor and little aesthetic touches -- like the train styled 'welcome' board above the elevators. The lobby area was terrific, and I wish I had had more time to spend there, reading and writing. Every little detail was thought through and don't even get me started on the sexy, gorgeous bathroom with a rain shower. Truly, it's rare to find a hotel that puts so much thought into lighting, wall decor, wood details, etc. and the Alex nailed it! For those who want a comfortable and stylish stay, this IS the place.",5,2019,09,03
215,"Beautiful hotel, amazing beds and service","We stayed here for my husband's 30th birthday and nothing was too much trouble for the staff here. Checked in quickly - beds are massive and super comfortable. Curtains really thick making it really dark for a great sleep. Rooms and hotel design overall is really beautiful and well thought out.  
Staff were amazing at helping me plan a surprise breakfast in bed - pre-ordering before our arrival. They also gave my husband free chocolate cake and prosecco as well. 
Bar and wait staff in the bar were also really thoughtful and friendly when we had lunch there one afternoon.
Honestly couldn't fault this place and would definitely stay again!",5,2019,09,03
215,Modern hotel near Trinity College,This hotel has a very updated decor and modern rooms with good desk service. The breakfast restaurant was included and was very efficient. Same day laundry service for simple washing was also a bonus. Recommend for staying in Dublin.¬†,4,2019,08,29
215,Gorgeous hotel with excellent service,"Recently stayed at The Alex on a trip to Dubin. The decor was absolutely gorgeous and had a Great Gatsby type of vibe. The rooms, restaurant, and lobby were decorated beautifully. Our bed was huge and very comfortable. The room was also clean and had all of the necessities, such as shampoo, soap, etc. The front desk was always kind and helpful. Would definitely recommended this hotel as the location was close to all of the attractions.",5,2019,08,28
215,Great Location,"Beds were comfortable and the USB port was handy by the bed. Couldn't figure out why there were no hooks in the bathroom for the towels.Perfect location for walking to various places -- Merrion Square, St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, the Liffey. Very handy to the 757 Airlink Express to the airport -- can get tickets from the front desk. Variety of food was good and the staff very friendly and helpful.",4,2019,08,27
215,Beautiful Retro Hotel,"Enjoyed our stay at The Alex rooms were clean and beds were comfortable.
Situated about 10min walk from Stephens green.
Breakfast was a let down for us. It was buffet and fairly standard. Would have enjoyed a choice of Eggs Benedict or other breakfast but the choice wasn‚Äôt there. 
For the price of the room & breakfast a bit more variety of food would have been nice.",4,2019,08,26
215,"Quiet, awesome hotel in a great location","My family and I are staying at the Alex. We have adjoining rooms with the kids in a twin room and the adults in a king room. We have been in a few Irish locations but this hotel has by far the most comfortable beds and we have had our best sleeps here! Also, the location is great as it‚Äôs just away from Grafton street at a 10 minute walk but benefits from a quiet location which is so unique for a city center hotel. The breakfast is great and the staff are super helpful. ",5,2019,08,15
215,"Stylish, clean and conveniently located!","The Alex is very stylishly done and our room was extremely clean. We appreciated the modern amenities including USB ports near the bedside. One tiny nitpick is that we had trouble keeping water contained in the shower since there was only a half wall. It was an easy walk to many things we wanted to see including Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and St. Stephen's Green. The hotel staff was very helpful and arranged a taxi to Heuston Station for us the morning we departed. Overall a great stay!",4,2019,08,13
215,Excellent Hotel in Great Location,"We spent two nights in the Alex in a lovely suite (room 500) and enjoyed the space and amenities. The room was well equipped, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the location is great, with pubs and the National Gallery within walking distance. Highly recommended.",5,2019,08,13
215,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at The Alex in July for two nights. A city break and the location is absolutely perfect. The hotel has recently been refurbished and the quality and style is outstanding. The bedrooms are bright, comfy and spotless, not to mention the bed a little piece of heaven! Every team member we met were pleasant and so helpful, chatty and attentive. Food was great too, nice bar/ lounge menu, the healthy tasty options combined with the favourites! A winner in my book. We will return. Thank you for a lovely stay! ",5,2019,08,12
215,Great location,"Totally enjoyed this hotel. Staff was fabulous location exceptional. Only complaint was ac could have been stronger but we were there during a heat wave. Breakfast was expensive at 17 Euro if you didn't do meal plan. Clean, great customer service central location. 100% recommend this hotel.",5,2019,08,10
215,Real gem,I stayed here for two nights midweek. The hotel is really good. The room I had was very well laid out and the bed was very comfortable. I used the restaurant for breakfast two mornings and it was of a very high quality. The staff were all very professional. I will definitely use this hotel again when in Dublin for business. ,4,2019,08,10
215,Great Find,"I booked this hotel on a strong recommendation from a friend and they really knew what they were talking about.  It's a wonderful hotel within walking distance from shops, pubs, and Trinity College.  The rooms are clean and nicely appointed.  I have never slept in a more comfortable hotel bed.  I'd have stuck that in my suitcase!  The staff is helpful and friendly, they couldn't have been nicer.  The onsite bar and restaurant are very good if you don't feel like walking but there's a pub 1/2 a block away if you don't feel like walking very far.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends.",5,2019,08,09
215,Undiscovered,"This hotel is close to Merrion Square, Trinity College (the Book of Kells), National Museum of Ireland, EPIC (the Irish Emigration Museum).  In other words, if you're looking to stay in the hustle and bustle of Dublin such as Temple Bar or O'Connell this place is not for you.  Having said that it is important to realize everything in Dublin is really within walking distance.  So if you're looking for a slightly off-the-beaten track hotel, on a quiet street but still easily accessible to most sights this hotel might be worth looking into.  

As others have mentioned, the Alex has a modern flair, friendly check in, large up to date rooms, great amenities (love their body wash), great shower, a safe, free bottled water daily (fizz and plain), close to an airport bus stop, with possibly the best breakfast on our ten day Irish trip (and that is saying something given some of the great Irish breakfasts we enjoyed).

One minor hiccup which seems to have bedeviled other reviewers:  we has reserved  two (twin) beds but were assigned a room with one king sized (actually it was two twins put together.  A complaint on checking in met with lots of agreement and apologies but no change the next day.  The second day's complaint brought gin and tonics as an apology, but we had to wait until the third day before a remedy was made (all it would have taken was separating the two beds and putting new linen on).  Just be aware of  a bit of a muddle between the front desk and guest services.

We made a mistake in not returning to the Alex on our return to Dublin from touring Ireland, deciding to spend one night in the Jurys Inn Parnell.  There is no comparison (except in price ironically, with the Jurys Inn being more expensive).  I would definitely return to The Alex next time I visited Dublin.",5,2019,08,08
215,What a nice hotel,"We got a room on the 6th floor and had access to the lounge. The room was perfect they even had a nice bottle of Portuguese wine and some chocolate cake waiting for us as we entered the room. The staff downstairs could not have been better and the breakfast buffet was more then anyone could ever want...a warm and true Irish ‚òòÔ∏è welcome.
Thank you again the staff at the Alex...each and every one of you ...too many to mention.",5,2019,08,08
215,Great coffee shop and lovely restaurant for lunch.  this place feels bizarrely undiscovered!,"This is a consistently good place,  the d√©cor is lovely,  the restaurant and coffee shop really quality,  the d√©cor makes the place feel hip and modern and just quality,  Well done on this lovely re-furb,  it looks perfect.",4,2019,08,08
215,"Fabulous location, great service, and great character inside.","We stayed at The Alex for 3 nights and were not disappointed. We booked 2 rooms for the 4 of us. It was casual, but it had great service, and the staff was very helpful. Breakfast was good, and the rooms were comfortable. The one caveat was you had the great location where you had no noise and you were close to everything, but, you don't have views. Overall, great hotel.",4,2019,08,05
215,Nice place,"This is a new, contemporary-styled hotel a short (10m) walk to the city centre. The road is quiet (just off a busy road) although the location itself definitely has no charm and feels a bit tired. We were completely happy with the location and the charm part really didnt matter as we got what we needed from walking around Dublin. 

Rooms feel fresh and although very standard in design, they felt different and we liked them. Both rooms we had were quiet (think both faced rear so cant say about front-facing, but the road is not a busy one) and we slept well on comfy beds. Breakfast is a la carte or a buffet (neither of which is included) and food is nothing to write home about, but gets you going in the morning. There's place to hang out in the lobby. Staff all friendly enough. 

So, why 3 stars? Well, I'd say this should be a 4-star hotel, but they messed up my reservation. I had two bookings - we stayed one night (regular room) and then one week later we had two nights (junior suite?). Before leaving I emailed and confirmed both stays and then when I arrived at the hotel for the first night I confirmed the second stay again. Despite all that, when we arrived for the second stay, they claimed to have had an IT problem so we could only have a regular room (not the junior suite? we had actually booked). Doubly disappointing as this was a big birthday for me. I will say they handled it as well as you could have hoped, offering first a free dinner (which we didnt want) and then 50 off per night as well as comping us breakfast. Seemed fair, so we accepted that.",3,2019,08,05
215,Holiday in Dublin,"Good location, nice looking hotel, lovely room and comfortable bed. 

Could be better: Room Was a little noisy, that said, maybe because of noisy guests. Amenities could have been given more as they were too little for a couple to use.",5,2019,08,04
215,Really lovely hotel,"We were meant to stay at sister hotel The Mont which was undergoing a revamp but wasn‚Äôt ready in time for our stay. We got transferred to The Alex which was only across the way. We had booked three rooms for our stay and we were delighted to receive Executive Rooms with access to the Executive Lounge with free drinks and snacks. Customer service was excellent at front desk and nothing was too much hassle. The lobby is buzzing with people coming and going, business meetings and social hook ups. Really cool modern vibe. A big thank you for our stay! We‚Äôll definitely be back to The Alex!",5,2019,08,02
215,Irish Breakfast with sugar! The best ,Alex hotel is located in the high scale area of Dublin close to the famous marrion Square. Everything was great especially the Irish breakfast that included fresh Irish salmon and upon request the best omelette I've ever tried... It was so delicious that I asked to the waiter who made this superb dish..he spontaneously replied that was made by Sugar.. An experienced breakfast chef that made the beginning of customer journey as sweet as his name... See you soon sugar! ,5,2019,08,01
215,Why is it not a five star!?!?,"This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at! My father and I originally booked into the nearby The Mont hotel, but got moved into The Alex due to non completion of building work at the brand new hotel. I accepted the offer to move hotels as it was only a minute walk away, and they had offered us a slight upgrade for our troubles. What a hotel! The Alex has a brilliant design and interior, with plenty of space to move around the lobby and hallways so you never feel hemmed in. Nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff, who made our stay outstanding - all the ladies at the front desk were great during our stay. We had an executive twin bedroom, which was brilliantly appointed and allowed us access to the wonderful executive lounge - well stocked with beers, wines, snacks and hot drinks. Our room was large with a great shower, big TV, a nespresso machine, prosecco, chocolates, robes, waters, and super comfortable beds. We ate at the Carriage restaurant downstairs which had great food and even better cocktails. The staff who were on the bar very late at night on the 22nd July were just brilliant in particular! 
A very memorable two night stay in Dublin, right in the heart of the city. My father hasn't been overseas for 27 years and you made his trip outstanding. We felt like truly valued customers. Thank you!
Would absolutely stay again given the chance!",5,2019,07,28
215,Long weekend at the Alex,"We had a lovely stay at The Alex. The staff were very helpful, our room was very comfortable and we would definitely stay here when we return to this beautiful city. Great location for getting around and early check-in call which was great!",5,2019,07,28
215,Wow!,"I booked a room in another hotel owned by this company, but it wasn't ready yet, so they rebooked me in the Alex.   Everything was so smoothly done--I got an email that I'd now be staying there, and when I arrived, I found they had upgraded my hotel room because of the inconvenience (there was no inconvienence--I was simply in a hotel a half a block away).  The Alex was fancier than the Mont, which I had booked, and the upgraded king room was amazing:  robes, rain-type shower room, and a nespresso machine (my favorite!).    When I came back after an evening out, I found they had delivered a complimentary bottle of prosecco and chocolate cake, again because I had had to shift hotels.   

What can I say?  Amazing room, and just outstanding customer service.  I would highly recommend any hotel managed by this property group!",5,2019,07,26
215,Great hotel!,Loved the Alex! Room was lovely and provided all the comforts.. Bed was great for weary travelers wanting a good nights rest. Very good location and agents at the reception desk were so helpful. Buffet breakfast  that was included was delicious!,5,2019,07,25
215,Great hotel ,We stayed here for our summer vacation in Dublin . The hotel is very close to all the tourist attractions in the city. The rooms are quiet and spacious. The staff is very friendly. I definitely recommend it. ,5,2019,07,23
215,Great Place!,"We stayed here two nights while in Dublin, and loved our executive suite rooms. So clean, comfy bed, and attentive staff. Breakfast both days was lovely. Well situated in the city, just a few blocks to reach St. Stephen's Green and Hop On/Hop Off bus stops. We recommend The Alex!",5,2019,07,22
215,"Stylish hotel, good location ","Recently stayed at the Alex with my wife on holiday. The hotel is located near Merrion Square and easily accessible to many of the sites of the city. The hotel lobby is stylish and restaurant serves a good buffet breakfast every morning. We had an executive room. The room was very large, surprising for Europe.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a nice rain shower. This room came with access to the executive lounge, which was a little underwhelming. The lounge is a small room on the top floor. They keep a fridge stocked with drinks, which was nice, but the snack selection was a little lack luster. Overall, we really enjoyed this hotel and found it to be conveniently located and very comfortable. Would stay again if in Dublin.",5,2019,07,20
215,"Great location, that‚Äôs about it.","Not a welcoming hotel, unusual for Ireland. No bellhop to help with the bags. Coffee shop in lobby closed all day on Saturday, no explanation given. Front desk seemed a little clueless, couldn‚Äôt answer basic questions without consulting the more experienced employee. No currency exchange. And on the way out of the garage it wouldn‚Äôt accept our credit card, called hotel, no help other than telling us to pay cash (which we did not have because there was no currency exchange ) Overall not a pleasant experience, not the polish of a top Irish hotel.",3,2019,07,16
215,In Dublin for Riverdance,"I stayed at the Alex for two nights with my wife while in Dublin to see the show Riverdance. the show was very good & we enjoyed it. The Alex hotel is excellent & the only reason I have not given it 5 stars is that there were no grab rails in the shower. My wife has a balance problem (it could be to do with the 28 pints of Guinness & 3 bottles of whiskey she drank!! only joking) & a grab rail would have been welcome for her. I am actually going to buy a suction pad grab rail that we can take with us in future. Anyway back to the hotel, the staff were very professional & the service in the restaurant was excellent. The room was a good size & very clean, & the location was good. The food in the restaurant was very nice & we really enjoyed our two night s stay, & if we visit Dublin again, we will stay at The Alex again. The Ginger man pub just next door is a good place to eat as well, but be warned the meals are very large. Our experience at Dublin Airport is another matter though. We arrived at the airport for our flight back & it was a complete shambles at the self check bag area. Once we had the case on the conveyor, we had to wait for quite a while before the case actually made it onto the conveyor belt. The two attendants obviously had not progressed their education past infant school, as they made no attempt to get the belt moving other than pull the odd case on to the belt. It was only when another attendant came & pressed the start button on the conveyor that every ones cases started to move. I felt sorry for some of the passengers who had to go through numerous gate changes before they could board their flights. There were at least nine announcements changing flight gates, with one flight being told three different gates, & at one point the passengers had been stood for 50 minutes at their second attempt & then told to change gates again. Complete shambles at the airport.",4,2019,07,15
215,A family affair,"Excellent hotel- gorgeous rooms and amenities. Staff are friendly, helpful and warm. Extremely tastefully decorated. If I had to suggest an improvement- I would request changing the breakfast buffet slightly.",5,2019,07,14
215,Fab hotel,"I'll get the one bad point out of the way first. Check out is noon and check in is 3 pm and despite arriving at 4 pm our room wasn't ready and we had tickets to a show at 6 pm so I wasn't impressed with that but other than that everything was amazing. The decor is reminiscent of 1930's, 40's New York. The best thing, and it's such a small thing, they have sockets to charge your phone right next to your bed which is such a rarity in hotels. It's centrally located, everything from theatres to restaurants and public transport is all within walking distance which eliminates the need for taxis. Excellent hotel.",4,2019,07,14
215,Will be back soon!,"Amazing hotel! Room and facilities are great, big room witch comfy bed.
The staff is very friendly and nice, I would like say a good word to Darren (hope I‚Äôm right), every time we came back to the hotel he was nice and welcoming.
The location is great, 10 minutes to St Stephan Green and Grafton street, 5 minutes to trinity, 15 minutes to temple bar/O‚ÄôConnell bridge and 17-20 minutes to Jervis Center. 
The Airlink (757) from airport stops right next to the hotel.
Will definitely go back!",5,2019,07,12
215,Great Hotel!,"We booked another hotel and they changed our booking to stay at The Alex. I'm so glad they did! Beautiful hotel, really friendly staff and great room with all of the amenities that you need. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,07,11
215,WestLondon85,"Great location. Fantastic bar. Will definitely be going back! Staff all very welcoming and rooms incredibly clean and definitely worth the very reasonable prices.

215,"Lovely hotel, overall poor service, rude staff","Arrived at the hotel at 14:40 and checked in. The receptionist told us our 2 room wasn‚Äôt ready as check in Is at 3 o‚Äôclock which was understandable. We gave in our bags and went off. Came back at 4:20 and was told again our room wasn‚Äôt ready, I was annoyed at this stage as we were heading to the westlife concert and wanted to freshen up before hand. The receptionist then told us one room would be ready in 3 minutes and apologised and offered us a drink but we refused as we wouldn‚Äôt have enjoyed it. 15 minutes later one of our rooms were ready and was told our keys would be dropped up to our room and then realised we were on different floors. We weren‚Äôt even given info about breakfast the next morning or what time check out was. Came back to the hotel at around 12:20 and went to the bar there was only 4 other people at the bar and two members of staff. As we walked into the bar we were stared at and given dirty looks by the bar staff which was very uncomfortable. 3 of us sat down and I went to the bar and was asked rudely were we residents and I replied yes. There was zero atmosphere around and felt like we weren‚Äôt welcome. We ordered 3 strawberry daiquiris and it took about 25 minutes for them to be made although there was only 4 other people sitting at the bar. Went back to our rooms to realise the electricity wasn‚Äôt working in one of the rooms called reception and a guy came up and was very rude as it was only a little problem with the card. Checking out we weren‚Äôt even asked was everything ok, no effort or interest in speaking to me. The decor and cleanliness of the hotel I cannot fault its a lovely hotel but is extremely let down by its overall service. Paying over ‚Ç¨530 for two rooms excluding breakfast and for terrible service is very pricey. I‚Äôm currently a supervisor in a 5 star hotel and know how busy hotels can be but guest satisfactory is key. I‚Äôm not one to complain but after this experience I would not return or recommend here based on service.",2,2019,07,08
215,Rude bar staff and sore back after bed ,"Mom and I stayed here during the westlife concert. We paid 300 Euro for the night which was way overpriced. 

Check in and out staff were friendly. Rooms were modern with nice decor. 
Showers only in the room a bath would have been nice. 

The beds had like an extra layer of what was like a mattress underneath the bed. Both mom and I had sore backs after the night and found it very hard to get comfortable in the bed all night as I seemed to keep finding gaps in the extra mattress thing that was on the bed. 

Upon returning from the concert, we entered the bar! Two staff that were on were extremely rude to us.  The place wasn‚Äôt busy and they were extremely slow to serve us. The man that was working asked us were we staying in the hotel and our number. He still didn‚Äôt believe that we were staying there and he asked for the surname. Before deciding to serve us he went to the till to check that we were staying there! Mom and I were extremely offended by this. We don‚Äôt mind being asked a room number as that is normal but to ask for a surname and check that we were staying was very offensive! He served us with no please or thank when asking for money and returning our change. 

This would turn us off returning again unless we had too. Would not pay 300 for the night again and that was without breakfast. ",3,2019,07,07
215,Great hotel,"I love this hotel. 

Nice and comfortable with very helpful staff who can‚Äôt do enough for you. 

TVs are modern with YouTube etc. which is great to see these days. 

Bit pricey but really modern bedrooms and bathrooms. Beds are super comfy. 

Great location too. ",5,2019,07,07
215,Couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough,"Lovely, lovely staff. Bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in.
Four of us stayed for two nights and drove to the races at the Curragh.
Parking was easy, ate in the restaurant on both nights and loved the food.
Fab hotel",5,2019,07,01
215,Had a very good experience ,"This hotel was very good , we found it well located to everything and basically a 10 minute walk to any of the major tourist points and and 2 minutes to the hop on hop off bus stop. 
Great breakfast and the food and variety was excellent 
Would stay again if we visited Dublin 
",4,2019,06,25
215,Quiet and friendly,"We spent a few nights at the Alex after travelling around Ireland for a few weeks. This was our 3rd hotel in Dublin and the nicest and quietest. It is a quiet location albeit not too far from some good bars and restaurants. 
The hotel has a modern design and the room was a good size with a work area and room for seating. While the bathroom was smallish, it was modern and well equipped.
The hotel has a nice coffee shop with pastries and other breakfast items, and is an easy lighter option for breakfast.
The front desk staff were very helpful with restaurant options/bookings and our check-in/check-out was seemless.
I would certainly stay here again.",4,2019,06,24
215,Good friendly hotel ,"I stayed for 2 nights and the bar staff were very friendly with good bar food. The rooms were well set out and I liked the Chromecast in the room so I could watch my Netflix shows. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the gym is in another hotel which was a bit of a pain but apart from that it was a nice stay. 

I would stay again. ",4,2019,06,22
215,Respite in a bustling Dublin downtown location,"What a relief! When we walked into the lobby of The Alex, we immediately felt at ease. Tired, hungry and exhausted from the end of a long tour, the Alex gave us a place to relax and rejuvenate before our transatlantic flights home.

We had stayed in 7 other hotels prior to The Alex and this one is by far superior. Rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed. Staff is friendly and helpful and ‚Äúon top of it,‚Äù anticipating guests‚Äô needs before we had to ask. And it was quiet! Our other hotels were bustling hotbeds of activity and confusion in the lobbies and bar (often the same place!).

This hotel has the qualities of a top global chain property with the ambiance and style of a boutique hotel. Any hotel with a copy of Paul Rand‚Äôs design book in the lounge knows about design.",5,2019,06,19
215,Great modern hotel,"The Alex is well located, a modern hotel, with friendly, helpful staff. An Irish breakfast was included with our stay, which consisted of a variety of buffet items, and beverages. The rooms were comfortable, quiet with in-room thermostats for temperature control. The staff was friendly and helpful at check-in and with advice for sight-seeing and restaurants.",5,2019,06,19
215,Great Stay!,"We recently stayed at The Alex and what a great experience.   Convenient location, friendly service and a very comfortable room.   We would go back and recommend to friends.    There are great pubs near by and convenient to Trinity College.",5,2019,06,18
215,"Great location, gorgeous hotel!","We booked this place solely because of it's proximity to the area we were meeting friends in but it turned out to be perfectly located for pretty much everything we needed! Firstly, the Airlink bus from the Airport stops just around the corner and a few mins walk from the hotel. Secondly it is within walking distances from the city centre shopping areas and nightlife but far enough away that it is quiet and peaceful.

The decor of the hotel was very stylish and modern and we were delighted when we showed up at 10am to ask if they could store our bags until checking, and they let us check into our room as it was already ready!

There is a fridge in the room and tea/coffee making facilities, also an iron. Lots of thought had gone into making the room practical such as lots of mirrors and plug sockets on each side of the bed, including USB sockets.The bathroom was pristine and well stocked with toiletries and towels.

We ended up eating dinner in the hotel as we thought the restaurant looked lovely and the menu very appealing. It was very quiet in there but this just meant the staff were very attentive, food and drinks came out promptly and were all very tasty and reasonably priced (for a hotel in central Dublin!).

We slept well, comfy beds and nice and quiet. We decided to have brunch in a cafe rather than pay for the hotel breakfast so can't comment on that.

I would definitely stay here again, as you can tell I loved it!",5,2019,06,17
215,Excellent Boutique Hotel,Very nice recently renovated hotel.  Staff was incredibly friendly and professional.  We arrived at the hotel at 7 a.m. and they had us in a room by 10 a.m. even though they were fully booked the day before.  Included breakfast was excellent with a large variety of food to choose from.  Room was great.  Only drawback was the thermostat would not let us turn the temperature down below 18 Celsius so we needed to keep the window open for sleeping as the bedding only included a warm comforter.,4,2019,06,15
215,"Super location, service and staff!",Location great to Trinity and Grafton Street. Executive Suite was A+++ with so much space and a massive Nespresso coffee maker which is critical for those early risers. Staff so helpful I plan to come back again.,5,2019,06,15
215,Great hotel in a nice part of town,"Start with the good stuff. We had a great big room, extremely comfortable bed, very friendly staff and very reasonably priced parking for city centre. Picked the hotel because of the conveniet location and proximity to the rds. It's about 1/2 hour walk and we were going to a gig. Would be very happy to stay again and would recommend the hotel to anyone if the price was right. Only slight issue is I thought the price we paid for one night really should have included breakfast. As I said it wouldn't put me off staying again. Great hotel in a nice part of town.",5,2019,06,15
215,Great hotel and location,"Nice, new, modern hotel. Close to Trinity College and an easy walk to the great pubs in Merrion Square. The rooms are a good size for a boutique and the rain shower was a nice touch. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,06,13
215,Great for the money!,"Nice staff, clean and renovated rooms. Great shower and good AC.

Breakfast ok but good for the price. Executive suite was a nice perk although it needed to be cleaned and restocked more often. Would definitely come again. ",4,2019,06,13
215,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Wonderful hotel‚Äî nice decor and vibrant atmosphere in lobby. Very sleek and comfortable rooms, and convenient walking distance to all the sights of Dublin. The mattress in our room was the most comfortable we‚Äôve slept on in a hotel.",5,2019,06,10
215,Best breakfast ,Popped into The Alex for breakfast last week. Staff were really friendly and welcoming. Food was top notch plenty of choice and absolutely delicious. We couldn‚Äôt of been treated any better. We‚Äôll definitely be back soon. ,5,2019,06,09
215,Fantastic experience,Great location excellent staff I think anybody staying will be well satisfied with their choice. The new bar menu serves some great food. Will definitely return here and would be a top choice when visiting Dublin,5,2019,06,08
215,"Modern, well-located, excellent staff","Thanks for a great 2 night stay. Nicole kind and helpful at front desk, as were the night staff we briefly met as we arrived very early AM. Clean, modern, good location. Excellent breakfast buffet... many hot and cold delicious choices. No problems. Enjoyed our visit.",5,2019,06,07
215,Hotel near everything,"My first visit in Ireland I booked through my travel agent in Canada . My priorities was walking distance from center. I like the hotel it is near everything by foot, shopping, pubs, museums. I asked for a guided tour of the city with a private guide and Nicole at the front desk who was very nice and friendly and always smiling even at 7 in the morning, suggested Brian Oleary and Thomas Walsh from tour by locals. They were awesome. Friendly, nice they knew all the right spots and the picture spots. We went to Wicklow (very very beautiful), Belfast (games of thrones scenes pretty cool) , cliffs of Moher. In all an amazing trip . My mom walks with a cane they always make sure she was ok and tended to her special needs. I wojld use their services any time and I recommend them.

The only down side is that the restaurant at The hotel only opened at 7 and some
Mornings if we wanted to get on certain tours we could not get breakfast since it opens at 7. The only drawbacks! 

The staff is really nice especially Nicole who was always present , nice , smiling and patient.",5,2019,06,07
215,Great time,"We made reservations through our travel agency, we are from Canada, and we arrived we were not sure due to the location.
After being greeted by a very friendly staff went to our room were pleasantly surprised. The room was more than adequate and very quiet even if we had first room after the elevator. Food was good and staff very friendly, the only setback was that for golfers breakfast starts at 7am.
The location is very accommodating and walking distance for shopping.
We asked for two guided tours and got very experienced and friendly guides and very attentive to our needs. If you wanted 
guides their names are Brian and Thomas their are the best.
We did not have for golf but will come for back for some in the future and will this H√¥tel and on our list.",5,2019,06,06
215,"Super comfortable, well located, quiet","For a weekend in Dublin, could walk to anywhere in center. close to Trinity College and National Gallery. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly, especially welcoming after an early morning arrival. Large, clean, stylish room. ",5,2019,06,03
215,"Service, Location & Quality","I can't say enough good things about The Alex. My family of four (hubby and two young adult sons) stayed here for three days in late May. Rooms are spacious and stylish. The breakfast buffet (which comes with the room) had a nice selection of hot foods, pastries, meats & cheeses and juices. We thought the location was ideal because it was a 10-15 minute walk to nearly everything we wanted to do but not in the heart and busyness of Temple Bar area. Most of all, the service was spot on. I left our passports in the safe and the reception tracked me down in Killarney and arranged to send them to me overnight. We were so thankful and impressed!",5,2019,06,01
215,"Great Accommodations, great location!","My husband and I were just at the beginning of our European vacation and spent just two nights in Dublin to explore a bit.  We loved our accommodations and the service at The Alex!  We were still suffering from jet lag, so the huge and very comfortable King bed in our room was a savior!  For a European hotel, the room was gigantic!  The furnishings were a fun combo of mid-century glam and everything was very clean.  We had great breakfasts both mornings at the restaurant and we had no issues with noise from outside or neighboring rooms.  

We also enjoyed that almost all of the sites we wanted to see were within walking distance, or a short cab ride away.",5,2019,05,31
215,Not Worth the Money,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights and we both we left wondering how this hotel could be rated so high on Tripadvisor. First, the hotel is a good 15 minutes walk to any major attractions and not the safest to walk after a certain hour. The rooms online looked wonderful, but in person, they really missed the mark. The bed was a lumpy mess, and the bed linens were too short and had holes in them. The bathroom was also very dark, plus the shower stall was so small my husband had to duck each time getting in and out. There were no wash clothes, instead, there were two very rough hand and small body towels. I will say the lobby area is very sleek and modern looking. Plus, the bar seemed to very popular for a quick drink after work. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a 4.5-star stay.",2,2019,05,28
215,A business man's hotel,"This is a very modern and sleek hotel.  I am sure our travel agent booked us here for the location as it is close to Merrian Square.  If you are looking for something quaint, this is not it. It was easy walking to many places, but the streets in Dublin, as in any old city, are not easy to navigate. 
The provided breakfast was very good.  The staff was friendly and offered advice and help to get us settled.",4,2019,05,27
215,Great short stay,"Only a one night visit but could have stayed longer. Central, good location and modern rooms with excellent amenities. Breakfast buffet was nice, small but good quality. A boutique hotel with value for the money, which is not always the case.",5,2019,05,19
215,Excellent location for this impressive edition to Dublin's hotel scene,We enjoyed a three night stay in The Alex and were impressed. The recently renovated hotel is right on trend with it's new decor with the rooms tastefully decorated and the restaurant and commons areas the same. We enjoyed the breakfast there and made use of the excellent gym in it's sister property The Mont. As a regular Dublin visitor I'll be keen to see how the Mont compares in the future.,5,2019,05,13
215,"Outstanding location, close to Trinity College, Grafton Street, and the DART.","Excellent hotel with large, clean, room. Pleasant and and helpful staff. Cannot beat the location for walking to Trinity College, Grafton Street, parks, and restaurants. DART one block away for easy accessibility for a day trip to Howth. Would have given five stars except for disappointing Executive Lounge included in the special room rate that was not well serviced. ",4,2019,05,12
215,Good location close to the happening areas of Dublin.,"We flew from London to Dublin. Took a bus to the hotel. The bus stops are everywhere around the hotel and was confusing when trying to take a bus to the train station! We could have walked faster. It would take about 45 min. It is an easy walk from the hotel to the main streets where the pubs and shopping is located. Easy walk to Temple Bar and the river front area. I‚Äôd say the hotel is a solid 4 star hotel. I did a lot of homework handicapping the hotels location and quality in Dublin. The king bed was saggy in the middle. Nice coffee, espresso machine, etc. The bar is nice. We did not have the breakfast. I felt the area was safe but there are a lot of street campers after about 10 p.m.",5,2019,05,05
215,Classy and convenient,"Ideal location for walking to popular attractions in Dublin.  Decor and hotel all beautifully refurbished. Comfy bed, great water pressure, and hot water.  Staff was helpful with securing a taxi for the airport.  Quiet room.",5,2019,04,26
215,Highly recommend,"My son and I stayed at The Alex for 3 nights the week before Easter.  We just loved this hotel.  I like the remodeled retro vibe. The room was spacious and well designed - I particularly like the built in cabinet in the hallway - I found the shelves very useful for laying out all my stuff. The beds were super comfy. The hotel is close to lots of the sites but not right in the mix, which we really liked. Two great pubs nearby - Ginger Man and Kennedy's. Just a few steps from HOHO bus stop.

Nicole at the front desk is a gem! She was so pleasant and always willing to answer questions. Ben in the bar was also very nice.

I have several friends planning trips to Ireland and I have recommended The Alex to all of them for their stays in Dublin.",5,2019,04,26
215,My new favorite hotel,"Stunning design hotel, top service, wonderful food, gorgeous interior, great location. Couldn‚Äôt fault it, absolutely perfect for a city break! Every detail has been thoughtfully considered. Marta and Vjeko were excellent. Will be back!",5,2019,04,25
215,Beautiful bedrooms and a fabulous property ,"This property has a great team and they go the extra mile for groups whether business or leisure. I especially enjoyed the breakfast which was delicious.  The decor at the property was lovely, very art deco and the cocktails were fab! Highly recommended for a city centre stay.",5,2019,04,23
215,A fantastic newly renovated hotel,We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Alex over the Easter weekend. The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout. Given its recent renovation and proximity to Dublin sights it represents great value for money. If I‚Äôm ever in Dublin again I‚Äôll definitely be staying here. ,5,2019,04,22
215,Highly recommended ,Where do I start on this one. I‚Äôm lying in one of the most comfortable beds I‚Äôve ever been in having just eaten a fantastic big breakfast from room service. The decor and facilities in the room are of the highest quality and the carpet is lovely underfoot. Staff have been more than helpful and efficient. Hotel isn‚Äôt too far from city centre and is in a very smart part of town. Good value for money too. We will definitely be back here. ,5,2019,04,14
215,So many corners cut....,"Really upset & disappointed in The Alex. Looks fabulous on the website. Stayed for 10 days, and so much wrong with the way the hotel is operated. Housekeeping totally substandard, breakfast often not ready, front desk obstinate & rude. I could go on, but I'll summarise and say just stay elsewhere.",2,2019,04,12
215,Fantastic stay,"I stayed here the weekend of the 15th of February with my husband. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by Cyril at the reception area while we waited to check in he then showed us to our room which was so clean and bright. And the bath is amazing!!! We went walking around the city center which is an easy walk from the hotel.
We ate in the city but returned to the hotel bar for drinks we had cocktails which are probably the best I have had anywhere and the staff at the bar where fantastic and full of chat.",5,2019,04,09
215,Highly recommend The Alex!,"The Alex was a great find! Having stayed in Dublin in my twenties and in Temple Bar, this was an upgrade. The Alex is situated near Merrion Square and was in a unique location allowing us to see parts of Dublin I would have otherwise. In addition, it‚Äôs walking distance to all the typical sites like Temple Bar, Christchurch Cathedral and Guinness (though that‚Äôs a longer - but doable - walk). The hotel itself is beautiful with good size rooms and big comfy beds. It also has 2 bars/restaurants right next door as good options for both food and drink. It‚Äôs also a short walk from Pearse station where you can take a 25 minute train ride to the beautiful seaside town of Howth - highly recommend. All in all - a fantastic stay and would highly recommend The Alex for those traveling to Dublin!",5,2019,04,08
215,2 nights - very good,"Lovely Art Deco dome hotel with a nice modern feel to it: bedroom large and comfy with good shower. 

Bar area more nice than luxurious and a wee bit draughty to sit but it was fine.

Breakfast was fine good selection of food. 

Dinner 2 nights. For me a mixed bag. Burger was good night one. Fish and chips less so night 2 - lemon sole as the fish for fish and chips didn‚Äôt taste right - why alter a classic? Unusual! Staff friendly and helpful.

I would stay again in Dublin.",4,2019,04,04
215,Lovely hotel in a great location with great service,"We recently spent 5 nights at the Alex during a visit to Dublin and loved this hotel. First, it is centrally located (just a few blocks from Trinity College) so you can easily walk to 90 percent of what you'd want to see in a visit to Dublin. Our room was spacious, comfy, QUIET (a must) and kept spotless. Desk staff were friendly, attentive (always quick to get us a taxi) and welcoming. The onsite Steam Cafe was a great place to grab a morning coffee and pastry before heading out.",5,2019,04,03
215,Amazing Hotel,"Recently stayed here with my friend for a girlie weekend of shopping. This hotel is beautiful, loved the whole interior design. The twin room was really spacious, especially for a city centre hotel. The location is brilliant, literally around the corner from the train station and 5 min walk to grafton street. We got the bus to dublin and the hotel was a quick 15 minute walk from the busaras station. We didn't eat at the hotel but liked that there was a cafe attached should you need a coffee etc to takeaway or eat in. We went to cafe en seine which was a gorgeous bar for drinks and music, only 10 minutes walk away. Though there are a few bars located  near the hotel which were always bustling. Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Dublin. ",5,2019,04,02
215,"Amazing, gorgeously designed,  central hotel","We adored our stay at the Alex. The hotel has been recently refurbished,  with art deco and contemporary design touches. I loved the bathroom of our room in particular. Huge bed.  Everything was spotless. Service was friendly and relaxed. Would definitely go back and recommend to others!!",5,2019,03,31
215,Lovely hotel and great location,"We stayed here for two nights on a weekend break to Dublin. We were really comfortable. The night manager was really friendly and welcoming. He also recommended some local activities which helped. Rooms were exceptionally clean and tidy. Only feedback I‚Äôd give is in the rooms, have a card at the desk which tells the numbers to dial for reception/other rooms/housekeeping etc. 
Location is great, on a quiet street but just a ten minute walk into the centre.",5,2019,03,31
215,Couldn‚Äôt fault it,"We stayed here for one night as we were in Dublin for a wedding. The hotel is beautifully furnished, really clean and there‚Äôs a good selection for breakfast. There‚Äôs a nice atmosphere here and the staff are friendly. Overall it‚Äôs great value and in a good location close to Merrion Square, Dawson St and Grafton St. would recommend. ",5,2019,03,30
215,First impressions last!,"During a busy week in Dublin, I had some business in the historical Georgian quarter of Dublin city in the very well located Alex hotel. So handy for transport links and a 2 minute walk to a lovely city park. Trinity college and lots of nice museums beside it too. (And pubs!!)
The reason I will come back here is the staff and particularly a Lovely young lady who seems to command the front desk with Grace and authority named Nicole. So pleasant, well presented, professional and knew everything about the locality. A real prize asset to the hotel. Thank you to the staff and I will be back!! üëç
Highly recommended.",5,2019,03,29
215,Loved the Room Decor,The room was absolutely gorgeous. It felt so cozy and somehow transported you to another time. The bed was super comfortable as well. The hotel has a contract with a gym across the street that had a top-notch workout facility as well.,5,2019,03,28
215,The staff make all the difference üòÅ,Came for St Patricks Day to celebrate our son's 21st. An 8 day stay in any hotel is a stretch but the wonderful Loredana on the front desk and the amazing Louise in the restaurant made our holiday perfect. Their amazing tips and suggestions gave way to the best Dublin experience and beyond. Day trips.. sports ticket .. private tours and taxi's were just part of the help .. even a phone home to get 'dads' suggestion on the best stadium seating. The hotel was our home away and its the small things that count. To our family The Alex was the best hotel in Dublin .. a happy and comfortable place to be .. thanks to the staff. üòÅ‚òòüíö,5,2019,03,21
215,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel, rooms a good size, bed very comfortable and bathroom area spotless
Good variety at breakfast (no muesli, hot milk and only plain yogurt but these are just personal preferences)  The public areas are well presented and very clean.  Staff very pleasant and helpful especially in the breakfast room. Good location just 10 mins walk to main shopping area.  The car park is 2 mins walk away and is secure but rather expensive. Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",4,2019,03,11
215,Almost ace Alex ,"Would currently rate 3.5 but definitely has the potential to be a 5.

Excellent location just a few minutes walk from the heart of Dublin. The hotel boasted chic public areas i.e lobby and restaurant, which made for a very cosy welcome. The room looked nice upon arrival and was sizeable for a city-centre hotel. The bathroom was beautiful and again, a good size. However, there were a few things that let the room down - the bed sheets didn't seem to fit the bed and always left the mattress exposed, there were only two smallish rough towels each, there were no bathrobes and there was no mini bar. If these small things were rectified, it'd be a great place to stay.",3,2019,03,09
215,Lovely stay,I stayed here with my family for just one night but it was gorgeous. The rooms are amazing and I love the 1920s style. The bed is super comfy. The bar looks amazing. My one complaint is the food isn't 'amazing' but it's good. Lovely breakfast buffet in the morning. Now one of my favourite hotels...,4,2019,03,03
215,Wonderful room,"We only had one night at this hotel, so I can‚Äôt really comment on the restaurants or other amenities. The room however was great. Someone spent a lot of time and money designing the layout. By far the nicest room we had in Dublin. Wish we would have stayed here for the first part of our trip as well.",5,2019,03,02
215,Long weekend in Dublin,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Alex hotel. We especially liked the location, Art Deco decor, spacious bedrooms and lovely buffet-style breakfast. Staff were also generally great. The concierge (Cyril) particularly deserves a mention, he was attentive, kind and helpful, with plenty of welcome advice on places to go during our stay. The hotel was also very understanding and helpful when our young daughter was unwell in the night, which could have been a stressful time for all. We were a party of four and had two rooms - a twin and a double, both very comfortable and well equipped. Only one minor niggle - the voucher system for breakfast seemed a bit confusing. On arrival we were given 6 vouchers (including one which had the wrong date on) but these then didn‚Äôt get asked for in the restaurant, so we stopped bringing them down, only to be told (when we were checking out and had a taxi waiting to take us to the airport) that we needed to find them and show them to Reception.  But this was a very minor criticism of an otherwise wonderful experience. We would definitely return!",5,2019,02,25
215,HIHGLY RECOMMENDED - Modern Design Coupled with the Most Exemplary Staff,"The Alex is a shining example of how thoughtful design and and amazing staff can come together to create an unparalleled experience. This newly renovated and thoroughly modern boutique hotel gets it spot on when it comes to prioritizing the 21st century traveler. 

Smart TVs are equipped with Miracast, Chromecast, radios with Spotify connect capabilities. The rooms of course have free WiFi, multiple outlet types, and even bedside usb outlets ‚Äì all the things that allow me to access my own media, keep my phone charged for in-bed screen time, and use the alarm I already use everywhere else ‚Äì the one on my own phone. 

The hotel bar, staffed with the finest and most engaging people, offers a fine selection of cocktails, wine, and beer, along with light bites and full meal service. Room service is also available off-hours (which is to say, 24-7). Thee location is steps from Merrion Square, Trinity College, museums, galleries, and all the best of Dublin nightlife ‚Äì you‚Äôll never be at a loss of something to do during your stay. 

Of course, none of these amenities would matter without the world class service from the truly personable, friendly, and accommodating staff, who (I must note with admiration) hails from a variety of countries throughout the world. From the moment I arrived until the end of my stay, every staff member I encountered at The Alex made me feel welcome and completely cared for. I would like to name names, but concern for the anonymity of these employees prevents me from doing so - upon reading this review, I am sure they will know who they are. 

Everyone working the front desk and hotel bar from the time of my arrival at 11:30pm on the 10th of February until my departure at 12:00pm on the 16th deserves the highest of praise.  The entire kitchen staff also deserves equal praise for the food prepared and served to me during my stay - everything was punctuated with a personability that rivals the most attentive six star star experience, exceeding that of all luxury hotels in which I have stayed.  I will absolutely return to this hotel whenever my travels permit me the pleasure of laying my head in Dublin, and I would recommend that all who value the quality of a thoughtful, comprehensive, and well-designed experience do the same.",5,2019,02,25
215,Average ,The hotel is ok but doesn‚Äôt really have character (or maybe my expectations were a bit high). It felt more like an upmarket Premier Inn than a boutique hotel. Rooms were nice. Food that I ate (fish and chips) was not good at all and the menu looked like it came from a Wetherspoons pub,3,2019,02,21
215,Very friendly,"Great stay - I couldn‚Äôt believe how friendly and helpful the staff was. Nice location in a quieter area but still easy to walk to the main attractions. A little tricky with the car park, but the staff helped us out tremendously.",5,2019,02,19
215,"Loved this hotel, location, style, staff etc... all brilliant","My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night and chose it last minute because we had an issue with a hotel we'd already booked and needed a nice place urgently. First I booked my room for the wrong bloody date but when I rang up they were so nice about changing it. 

The hotel itself is brand new, modern but the decor is kind of retro which I loved. The price was on par with most hotels of this type in the city which is fair enough. On checking in the staff were really friendly and when they saw us coming back in at 1am they didn't ignore us like most hotels do, they stopped us and asked how we were etc..which was actually quite nice! The room itself we had was clean and beautiful. I love the touches with the little phone and radio etc....very Mad Men! I also thought the shower and bathroom were the cleanest I've seen in a hotel before. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will most likely stay up here again.",5,2019,02,18
215,Really impressed ,"We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very centrally located, the perfect base for exploring the city and great value too. 
The staff were all very friendly, professional and helpful. 
I loved the decor, very original but tasteful and everything is so fresh after the recent refurbishment. 
Really spacious rooms and the bed was so comfortable. We didn‚Äôt want to leave! 
We had breakfast delivered to our room and it was delicious. Our friends had breakfast in the restaurant and said it was great. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,02,17
215,Excellent stay,"Had an amazing stay, the hotel is beautifully designed, room was nice and cozy.. had everything I needed. Staff was so nice all the time. 
The hotel is only a 15-20 minute walk from the center of all shopping and restaurants/ bar
Kudos to Marta from the front desk",5,2019,02,15
215,lovely staff .. great place,"Fantastic place made even more special with amazing staff, people such as Loredana Niminet who go the extra mile in customer care. Large lobby ,a very welcoming and  distinctive decor - Fab sized bedrooms and lovely food.. Will be back , relaxing, luxurious .. 10/10",5,2019,02,14
215,Most comfortable beds!,"I love this hotel and it‚Äôs simple and modern design. In dublin it certainly is one of the better and most comfortable. Great wonderful and comfortable beds, lovely modern bathrooms and power showers. The breakfast buffet has a wonderful choice and attentive staff.",4,2019,02,13
215,In two minds,"I‚Äôm in two minds about this place... I travel to Dublin often from Kerry & love the city. I‚Äôve passed the Alex numerous times & always wanted to stay here. Check in was ok... instructions to the car park were so unclear we asked 3 times then felt that we would be able to find it ourselves then ended up going back in after driving around in a circle 2 or 3 times... (please use the 15‚Ç¨ car park charges to get proper signage & maybe some lighting for the entrance, it was dark when we arrived & maybe use the charge to fix the LED lights also when you enter the car park)... it could probably have been explained too that there was a lift for the car... we entered the car park to the left and luckily there was just one space! On our way out of the car park we noticed that the LED sign that‚Äôs half working actually says car lift... 
room was ok, quite clean, compliments to the accommodation team. Problem with our bedroom door... reception sent someone up while we were at dinner, we were told the door was ok (even though it wasn‚Äôt actually closing properly) I went up to show them what I meant to which they laughed and said you have to bang it (and by bang they meant wallop) room 510 I think we were in... I didn‚Äôt think a hotel door would need such a bang, it should almost close itself.... I was able to push it open without my keycard if I did not bang it, reception and the man washing the lobby floor who ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù seemed to find this hilarious... 
food was terrible, pretentious! Rib eye is fatty steak yes, but the amount of gristle in it was ridiculous. The guy with the long hair behind the bar needs to stop the staring, it‚Äôs creepy & put away his mobile phone! And the man with dark skin needs to stop drinking the drinks at the bar! (Overheard him say he was having a ‚Äúhenny and coke‚Äù).... it was quiet & im all for having a laugh at work but... it took the biscuit for me when 10.30 came and we were just finishing up our drinks & again the long haired dude said we could close now but they need to get out first... like hello there‚Äôs no one else in here we can hear you?! I didn‚Äôt feel it was my place to comment because I may have flipped a switch at this point. Also the manager, I‚Äôm assuming he was the manager on duty that night, was very unwelcoming. Doubt we‚Äôd return, there are hotels with less stars which are of higher quality in Dublin.",3,2019,02,10
215,THIS HOTEL EXCITES ME! ,"I stay regularly for work and each month I genuinely am excited to be back here. 
The hotel is divine, an absolute gem to behold. üòÄ. The rooms are super stylish & very warming. ü•∞
All of the staff are extremely friendly, and have always been super accommodating to any requests. 
But I must give an extra special sparkly mention to the the wonder that Is... CARLOS. He is the friendliest, nicest and kookiest hotel staff member I have ever had the privilege to meet, I genuinely enjoy seeing him each month, I may just have to pack him up In my case and take him with me next time. üò¨ü•≥üíì

CANNOT WAIT TO BE BACK TOMORROW üòÜ",5,2019,02,07
215,Subpar and rude service,"The Alex is a nice hotel, I loved the interior and I loved the room decor. But an aspect I found appalling was the rudeness of the staff and the sheer lack of details they pay to customers, even though I was staying at the property for 12 nights on a business trip. 

I had for example written a note and requested for only complimentary still water, but they threw out the note and continued serving sparkling plus still water. Never mind that, I was mostly out anyway and didn't needed two bottles so it was alright. 
The throw as a form of decor on the bed was stained. Never mind that too, wouldn't ever use that throw anyway. 
I emptied the tissue box on one day, and the next day found an empty tissue box case with a blue cleaning towel right beside it. Well thank you for leaving your cleaning towel AND not giving me new tissues, but well I called them and requested for a box of tissues to which it was promptly delivered so that's fine too.
They had given me a plate of fruits on day 1 since I was staying with them for a long period of time, and they have been delivering fruit knife, utensils and plate to my room for whenever I called to ask for them but one day, a receptionist cut me off and directed me to the restaurant to which the staff demanded a 5 euro TRAY CHARGE to have my knife, fork and plate to be delivered to my room, which had never happened before on the last 5 times I've requested for it. Plus, there was never a TRAY that came along with them, which was probably why they were not charged. 
So I followed the restaurant staff's instructions and headed down to grab the stuff up to my room myself and wanted a clarification on why a tray charge was all of a sudden necessary, perhaps they have changed their policies, but I was rudely cut off when the phone rang and without asking me to hold on there, the receptionist proceeded to pick up the phone. After he hung up and could finally speak with me, I was going to continue my conversation until the restaurant staff came out, and interrupted me AGAIN by butting in. Never felt so undermined in my entire life. 

But one thing is sure, the service is the worst aspect of this hotel. In this city with options abound, I'll absolutely not choose The Alex the next time around.",2,2019,02,06
215,"Great hotel, lovely breakfast","Stayed recently on business.

The hotel is very nice to look at, the bar especially which doubles as breakfast / dining room is warmly lit in the evenings and very tempting and comfy.

My room was everything you'd expect - all mod cons, clean, lovely shower.
Iron, hairdryer and tea/coffee all present and correct which is as it should be!

The breakfast was very good.

Special mention of Carlos on reception who made me feel particularly welome.

Highly recommended.",5,2019,02,04
215,Lovely hotel with amazing management.,"Carlos and his team were beyond amazing. Very friendly and extraordinarily helpful! I came into the lobby while it was pouring rain outside and  Carlos immediately took care  of me and had me checked in in no time. My room was beyond great, modern, comfy and had all amenities I needed for my two day conference. Breakfast was delicious and had a good spread. Hotel would also be a great stay for couples! Can't wait to go back!",5,2019,02,02
215,Comfiest stay,Stayed here a couple of nights and had the most relaxing stay. The beds were really comfortable and they were nicely sized rooms. The concierge couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and the location was great- no more than a 10 minute walk to the center.,5,2019,01,28
215,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"A wonderful, quirky, beautifully decorated hotel that looks like something out of a Wes Anderson movie. The room is spacious and luxurious. The cocktails in the bar were delicious and unique. Staff were extremely helpful. 

The location was brilliant, easy walking distance into Dublin centre including Temple Bar and the national library, museums and art gallery.

The only downside is my partner and I are vegan and there were no vegan options in the restaurant menu (although, to be fair, we did not ask if anything vegetarian could be made vegan for us). ",5,2019,01,26
215,A quick drink but a lasting impression,"I popped into The Alex for a drink while attending a conference in the city, and was welcomed not just by gorgeous surroundings and ambiance, but by wonderful staff. 

The selection of gins and other spirits from around the world provided plenty of choice - enough to cater to ones mood as well as taste. 
After chatting to Dylan the bar manager, I gained a further appreciation for the art of tending bar, and some great ideas on how to enjoy my stay in Dublin more. The whole team on shift appeared professional, approachable and knowledgeable, and with Dylan at the helm, I have no doubt that The Alex can provide a space which is new yet familiar, upmarket yet accessible and a haven for weary minds.",5,2019,01,23
215,"Great bar, nice and helpful staff, good selection of cocktails","Been there 3 times now while attending a conference in Dublin. Once for dinner, and twice just for drinks meeting some colleagues. Since I didnt stay at the hotel, I cant say anything about the rooms. The bar itself is very nice and welcoming though. On my second visit the bar manager Mr Lindo even recognized from 2 days ago and made quite an effort to give me some recommendations on their wine and cocktails menu. Great service! Highly recommended if you want to enjoy some nice relaxing atmosphere.",5,2019,01,23
215,Lovely one night stay,"Stayed for one night. Wish we stayed longer. First impressions of the room was the size, huge for a city centre hotel. The beds were also huge and super comfortable. Lovely full length mirror, safe and fridge in room. The bathroom was beautiful with a big waterfall shower. Very modern but also very cosy and welcoming. Easy check in/out, and staff were very welcoming. We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel but we ordered two diet cokes from the bar which cost just under ‚Ç¨8, quite pricey for small bottles of fizz. Only complaint was that we were woken early by road works outside, but I know that isn‚Äôt the hotels fault so I can‚Äôt knock marks for that. Very pleasant stay, and would stay again. ",5,2019,01,21
215,"Short stay in Dublin, Ireland","Nice modern hotel, easily accessible from the center of Dublin. Good value for money with clean super clean rooms. All the staff we encountered were polite and helpful, the Night manager Darren was cheerful and knowledgeable about Dublin. We will return.",5,2019,01,19
215,Professional Amazing Staff,"Great place to stay, closed to everything needed on walking distance. Amazing caring staff, great space and value for money. 

Keep the good job..thank you.

Would love to be back again sometime soon with family and friends..",5,2019,01,17
215,"Location... tick, Staff... tick, Service... tick.","In advance of booking any hotel, I, like most people, look at Tripadvisor Reviews. One factor I consider when doing this is how the hotel deals with any customer issues that may have arisen during their stay. It often gives a sense of how you might be treated if any issues arise during your own stay. I am very happy to report that the staff (in particular Darren and especially Nicole) dealt with an issue during my stay last weekend with the utmost professionalism, going above and beyond to ensure the issue was resolved to our satisfaction. In doing this, it was a clear demonstration that (a) the quality of the training the staff receive is strong and is being implemented on the ground (b) the hotel genuinely does want it's guests to 'Rest, Relax, Roam' in our experience. Thank you for demonstrating your commitment to your own brand values. Because of this, we will recommend you to others.",5,2019,01,14
215,Amazzzzing,"Stayed here Thursday 10/1 for a concert and night out with a friend and we decided to stay somewhere a little bit extra nice for a treat before she moves abroad for a few months, so so glad we did and so glad we chose The Alex above other places I considered, with advice from my mum.

We‚Äôre only in our early twenties and I often feel like staff completely dismiss you at this age in nice hotels and hotel bars, but not here at all. Receptionist was a foreign accented male didn‚Äôt get his name but he was at check in around 3:30 pm and he was just so nice, and had a little bit of banter with us. Girl in bar at same time was so nice about giving us wine for room with ice bucket etc. 

Overall just a pleasant experience and a nice hotel to help complete a great night. Only tiny note is we were disappointed to have no robes in our room. 

Will be back again for similar trip and will be recommending. ",5,2019,01,13
215,Great Bar Staff,We stayed here just before Christmas and we had a great stay. Cathal in the bar was great to us all night and even recommended some local attractions for us to visit around Dublin. Thanks for your help Cathal.,5,2019,01,12
215,Christmas Shopping overnight stay,Really impressed with this lovely modern and sleek hotel. I stayed here in December doing some Christmas Shopping. Great location - the beds are so comfy and the rooms are well equipped. I will definitely be returning soon. I cant tell you how fantastic the breakfast was !,5,2019,01,08
215,Our 1 year anniversary spent in style,"I found The Alex Hotel when trying to find somewhere special to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. I loved the location. I am an art teacher and being a few minutes away from the National Gallery was a real treat. 

We were greeted by a wonderfully friendly receptionist who congratulated us and then informed us that we had access to the executive lounge as a treat. We we're already won over at this stage due to the welcoming atmosphere. The room is beautiful and chic. I loved the mixture of modern and 60's style furnishings. The bed was huge and so comfortable. 

We were given a further surprise when we returned to the Hotel we found desert in our room and a lovely note to congratulate us once again. 

Our stay was so enjoyable from start to finish. We felt our celebrations were made all the more special by their exceptional service. I would highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2019,01,05
215,The Alex Hotel,"Incre√≠ble experiencia en un hotel precioso y que cuida los detalles al m√°ximo. Bonito, bien cuidado y una atenci√≥n insuperable.  Everything was amazing. The employees were very nice with us, specially thanks to CARLOS who was very kind with us, we will come back for sure!!! ",5,2019,01,02
215,Could be great,"5-day stay, the good:
- Great location near everything 
- Very friendly and helpful staff, but all the Irish are so friendly 
- Nice sized rooms, comfortable beds

The so-so:
- Breakfast was average 
- satellite TV reception spotty
- room was a little run-down

The bad:
- the shower was a raised platform that you had to constantly monitor to ensure it didn‚Äôt flow over into the floor
- the bath didn‚Äôt have an electric plug for a blow-dryer
- one of the elevator‚Äôs was out of service making getting up and down sometimes very difficult on only one elevator ",3,2018,12,21
215,1 nights stay,Recently stayed in this hotel after I heard great things from some friends who stay regularly for work. Perfect location with such a short walking decent to city centre. The rooms where massive and the beds are probably the best sleep Out of my own bed. Great dinner and breakfast. The staff where friendly and very attentive I look forward to come back here for a longer stay,5,2018,12,20
215,Excellent service ,We had booked to stay here for a Christmas night out we had been waiting to check in and decided to have a drink at the bar and I cannot believe the exceptional service we had received from barman Cathal. He really is a credit to your hotel thank you very much for everything Cathal.,5,2018,12,18
215,Superb beds,"My and my wife stayed at the Alex for 3 nights. The Hotel is newly furbished and looks very smart. The room and bathroom were very clean and situated at the back of the Hotel. The bed was heavenly, king sized and wonderful crispy sheets, really superb. The staff at the reception was very helpfull, especially Carlos, who happens to speak also Dutch because he is from South Africa. What a treat is was to stay at The Alex; near the shopping area, the National Museum (with a famous paiting from Carvaggio), at walking distance from The Temple Bar area, and also near the 757-bus stop which brings you to Dublin airport. If we visit Dublin again, we will certainly stay at The Alex. Carlos, thanks again for your excllent service and helping us with making  reservations at the restaurants. A excellent choice for those who visit the harbour of Howth, go to tapas restaurant OCTOPUSSY'S. It has very, very good seafood. Hans and Andrea",5,2018,12,18
215,Lovely,"Had a great stay at the Alex. Great location and the room was amazing. Loved it, breakfast was great too. Can't complain!! 

Would really recommend staying here. It was my boyfriend's birthday and little cakes were left in the room for our arrival it was a really nice touch!!",5,2018,12,17
215,Nice hotel... poor customer service,"I stayed in the Alex hotel, it was very nice and clean, nothing negative about our room. The check in staff were lovely and helpful!! 
The check out staff were rude and not personable!! We parked in the private car park in down the road, we didn't get change from the machine, we contacted the hotel and they said they'd sent someone down but no one came back with the change, we waited over 20 mins in the cold until I called again and I was told to come back to the hotel and they'd give us the change, the staff were so rude when I called, like they didn't believe us!!  they just handed us the money and didn't say anything, poor customer service!!",3,2018,12,15
215,First stay ,"Had our first stay in the Alex and we will definitely be back. From front of house to housekeeping we were greeted by a warm smile from all the staff. The rooms themselves are spacious and modern, we found the rooms to be very quiet and could not hear any noise. We really could not fault our stay. A special mention to Nicole in reception who dealt with us and any of our problems in an efficient and professional manner. I think for the staff alone would be a massive reason why we will be returning to the Alex in the near future!",5,2018,12,12
215,Alex Hotel - Superb,"I regularly meet colleagues at The Alex Hotel, the reburbishment is superb, it is like going back to the Great Gatsby era.  The food in the bar is top quality, the tapas are exceptional value.  I particularly like the ambience, the warmth of the staff and the creative design of the hotel.  Exceptional.",5,2018,12,10
215,My Dublin home,"I stayed in the hotel on the first weekend of December all staff in the bar Saturday night were amazing and helpful with every request we made. On Saturday night we had a few drinks in the bar where we tried the hotels cocktails and let me tell you they are quiet expensive however they are defiantly worth the it. Our drink came fast and where served with a smile. Reception were wonderful on check in however Saturday night I could not find anyone there to help me book a taxi for the morning, luckily Nicole the following morning was accommodation and happy to lend a hand. She organised a taxi that excepts card (which is not easy to find in Dublin) and off we went. Will defiantly stay here again and recommend it to anyone.",5,2018,12,08
215,A barn of a ground floor space .... a kind of a giant common room!,"Odd sort of ground floor space. In its previous existence the ground floor was more formally organised. This manefestation is still a bit confusing.
I needed something to eat and headed into the cafe/restaurant.
Delightful staff.
I had fish and chips. Looked fine. But the cod was more than a little 'watery' and little thin fillets (two). The batter was OK and the chips tasty.
Would I go back? If I was meeting someone in the immediate area, yes. But I would not go out of my way to eat here.",3,2018,12,07
215,Home away from home!!,"I was recently carrying out a field role with work and obviously this involved a lot of travelling all over the country. So I was going from hotel to hotel and found no place better than The Alex. All staff were genuine, very friendly and always there to help and at times lend a ear. From cleaning rooms to helping with directions(I‚Äôm from the west) and everything in between. I stayed here for 3 weeks straight checking in on Mondays and checking out on Fridays and I can honestly say that I really enjoyed all my time time there. I was sorry when I was moving back to my normal role. Thanks again to all the staff for everything. As I said in the title it truly was a home away from home!!",5,2018,12,05
215,First stay,"I regularly visit Dublin and usually stay in the sister hotel the Davenport. On arrival the receptionist seemed a little put out that he had to check me in, thankfully this did improve and off I went to my room. The rooms are fabulous and I actually prefer them to the Davenport. Unfortunately the service does not compare to the sister hotel. During my 3 night stay I ordered room service twice. Both times I had to call multiple times as the phone kept being put down without answering. The second night I was faced by a rather rude restaurant assistant to take my order. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that I was so tired I would have told them not to bother and I would have ordered a takeaway! Such a shame. I will stay again but avoid having to interact with the staff!",4,2018,12,05
215,Excellent staff and service,"I stayed one night at the Alex for a quick stop in Dublin, hotel is spotless and has everything you need. Comfy rooms and excellent breakfast. One special note to Marta at the front desk who was incredibly helpful and friendly- she sorted out every request immediately, always with a great smile and professionalism. I'll be back!",5,2018,12,04
215,Best staying in Dublin,"My partner and I were travelling around Ireland and decided to stay at the Alex for our 3 nights in Dublin and it was absolutely the perfect choice. Location is brilliant, hidden away from the traffic but straight in the city centre- few minutes walking distance from the main attractions. Very cosy hotel, we were welcomed by the lovely Marta at the reception who suggested great restaurants and things to do in the area. Cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2018,12,04
215,Good but...,"We stayed at The Alex for three nights in late November on our first visit to Dublin.

The good - great location, modern hotel that seemed to be well patronised, large rooms, a lounge area with beverages which was great at the end of the day and the breakfast (really good).

Not so good - the basic measure of most hotels is can I get a good nights sleep. As noted in other reviews, the insulation in the walls between walls is not sufficient such that we could hear the TV next door and conversations. Now if the room next to yours is empty then there is no problem but if you have neighbours, then it can be noisy. Good sound proofing should prevent the need to have to call reception and ask them to contact the neighbouring room and ask that they reduce their noise levels.",4,2018,12,03
215,Perfect stay,"The hotel was perfect the staff were all friendly and helpful,we had dinner and drinks in the restaurant and the service and quality of the food was excellent, a big thank you to Paul Joy, who could not do enough for us. Cant wait to return.",5,2018,12,02
215,Helpful and courteous front desk staff.  Excellent location!,"Nicole and Pablo at the front desk were especially courteous and helpful.  They always remembered our names. 
The location is excellent, close to the city centre but just off the beaten path so nice and quiet.  We could walk to most of the sights.
Bed was very comfortable - just perfect!
Breakfast buffet delicious with a good variety.",5,2018,12,02
215,"Nice stay, but","Nice stay, good room and breakfast - some details need improving (one of the two elevators was being maintained during the 3 days; problems with one of the electrical sockets)
Expensive, as it is perhaps the norm in Dublin.",4,2018,11,29
215,Best Hotel in Dublin,"First trip to Dublin from the US and we immediately fell in love with the Alex.  From the first impression to the last, the hotel exceeded our expectations.  Great design from the facade to the lobby to the guest room.  Location is perfect- steps away from local pubs (one which plays the American football games), Trinity College, Parks, Museums, and lots of restaurants and bars all with their own character.  We recommend paying for the Executive Room as the room is beautiful- great layout, new furniture, large space with closet, amazing mattress and wonderfully designed bathroom. Two of us were super comfortable during a 4 night stay. The staff  made the experience memorable- Nicole gave us a warm welcome and a follow up call after settling into the room- great service! The housekeepers in the lobby and overnight bellman represented the hotel very well, always wore a smile and offered assistance with a genuine greeting.  And Marta at check out made the billing and luggage storage experience seamless for us, exactly what we needed after a long stay and before a long day of travel.  She really put our minds at ease!  The Alex is a wonderful hotel and the only one we will stay at when traveling to Dublin in the future.  The General Manager must foster a great culture within the hotel because as guests we recognized genuine service with each staff interaction.  Thank you to all the team at the Alex!  ",5,2018,11,26
215,Great hotel,"Booked a hotel close to the national concert hall as I was there with work. The Alex was extremely nice, with very friendly staff. 
A limited menu for bar food, but the food was good quality.
Overall, a very good city centre hotel, that I will be staying in again I'm sure",4,2018,11,26
215,Excellent service.. excellent rooms,"The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was fantastic and extremaly comfortable. Very clean.great quality duvet and pillow, Bathroom was very hudge  with nice Fresh towels. Everything was perfect. Breakfast was delicious and fresh  .Staf were very helpful  with smile at bar but i had bad experience at reception. I wanted change reservation, and they were very strict, I dont like it. The best for this  nice hotel will change staff at reception. Good luck. i ll reccomend this hotel. Thanks for everything.",5,2018,11,22
215,Enjoyable stay,"We recently spent 3 nights at the Alex. Arrived in the morning and were able to check in early at no extra charge.Our room was comfortable, not too noisy or too hot. Housekeeping staff did a very good job, all the staff were polite, friendly and helpful. Location is good- fairly quiet and an easy walk into town, handy for museums and galleries, airport bus stops down the road. Food was good- not fancy and not overpriced. Our only gripes are that there were several scuffs/marks on the walls of our room and the room was opposite an office block but there was no net curtain so we felt as if we were ‚Äúon view‚Äù if the curtains were open. This said I would definitely recommend this hotel when visiting Dublin.",4,2018,11,21
215,"Excellent Staff, Excellent Facilities","I don't like to travel and have never been off the American continent before. The staff at The Alex were happy to help me figure out everything I needed, including transportation, culture, amenities, and services I needed to set up. The hotel is in a great location, within easy walking distance of the National Gallery, Dublin Castle, Trinity University, and dozens of fine dining and more casual restaurants. The room was very clean and everything was in fine working order, you could tell attention to detail had been paid in preparing the room for guests. All in all a great place and my go to for future visits.",5,2018,11,19
215,perfect location for a weekend,"charming and quiet room, clean. excellent breakfast buffet. good location, close to the city center but not in middle of the crowd. all sights reachable by foot, some nice pubs around the area. friendly staff.",5,2018,11,19
215,Staff make a Hotel.,"My first trip to Dublin and I decided to stay in the Alex hotel and let me tell you I was not disappointed.The hotel had a great location, was trendy and fresh and the staff well, the staff from the bar to the housekeeping and the reception where constantly professional but warm and welcoming at the same time.

Nicole from the reception particularly stood out, behind the reception she looked so busy but still had a constant smile on her face happy to help anyone (Clearly someone who loves their job). She got us an early check in, we also mentioned that although we were here for business we had some time to visit Dublin. Well she organised everything from booking our tickets online to taxi's and even calling Kilmaham Gaol when it looked as though they had been sold out.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone business of otherwise, and I will certainly be back.",5,2018,11,14
215,business in Dublin,"The Alex was fantastic. We arrived very early morning (7am local time) after an overnight flight fro the US. fully expected to hear that checkin wasn't until the afternoon. But we were thrilled when the wonderful staff said our rooms were ready and we could check in (at 7:30 in the morning!). This allowed us to take a brief nap, shower and off to explore the city by 11am fully refreshed. Thanks Alex for making my stay great!. ",5,2018,11,12
215,Great experience for hosting Dublin Marathon Volunteer Programme,"We engaged The Alex Hotel this year to host the SSE Airtricity Dublin Marathon Volunteer Programme.  We visited in advance of the event and the staff were very accommodating in all our request both in advance of the day and on the day itself, there were a number of challenges to be met on the day and the staff were accommodating of all our requests and requirements.  Last year we went to the Mont Clare, but the newer and better equipped Alex was much better suited to an event of this size.",4,2018,11,11
215,"Trendy hotel, well located","Felt very much like a business hotel, not warm or welcoming at all. Trendy and modern, half the lobby is dedicated to workspaces of two long desks with lamps.

We were foruntate to stay in a suite, which was exquisite, very well appointed and designed. 

They have a 'hands off' approach to their customer care... So if you like feeling well looked after in a hotel, this is not the place for you. Reception staff friendly.
",4,2018,11,10
215,"Great hotel, can't wait to return","Had the pleasure of staying here at the weekend. We chose it because of its ideal location and modern look(which both were exactly what I expected). And we will return for the warmth of the staff, the excellent food and the most comfortable bed I have had in a hotel.
The reception staff welcomed us so well, it felt like we had been there before. They were so helpful with our questions. We had a drink in the bar and the barman made us a great cocktail..will be back for more! The breakfast had everything we could have wanted..everything was fresh and tasty and plentiful.  Looking for our next reason  to get back there. 
",5,2018,11,05
215,Great hospitality from Marta!!!,Nice hospitality from the reception desk! Served by Marta which was fluent in giving suggestions on how to travel through Dublin!! Very friendly! Great hotel!! I will definitely come back here! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº,5,2018,11,04
215,Not worth it,"Stayed here because of location to start/finish line of marathon. Terrible smell of cigarette smoke in bedroom  toilet. Breakfast not opened until 7.30am most people staying were doing the marathon so bit of a rush in morning. Service at bar after marathon was terrible. Would not allow me to order food at bar, told me they would send a waiter down to our table,  never came. It looked like there was no managers present. In fairness hotel is clean and modern but not worth ‚Ç¨220 for a night. ",2,2018,10,29
215,Awful hotel for Dublin marathon!,"We have just returned from The Alex hotel having stayed the night prior to the Dublin marathon. We choose The Alex as it is located so close to the marathon start and finish, however we payed through the nose for it ‚Ç¨330 for the 1 night! 
- The positives for the hotel were lovely clean, comfortable rooms.  
- The negatives however outweighed this, and we would have nothing else good to say about our stay. 
- At check in the staff were rude, abrupt and unhelpful, and we were informed that breakfast on the morning of the marathon could be extremely busy and there could be a long wait. With two people in our group taking part in the marathon we could not run the risk of them missing breakfast, so we were advised ordering breakfast to our room would be a good option. 
- In our rooms we could not find the breakfast card, so we followed up with reception. After our third time requesting cards we were told they were out of them and were trying to get some. We decided to wait in reception until one was found during which we overheard the manager telling the receptionist if we requested a card then we should be given one - low and behold a breakfast card was immediately given to us. 
- We filled in the card, ordered breakfast to be delivered between 7:15-7:30
- Next morning no breakfast arrived, we checked with friends in the hotel and the same happened with them. Rang reception numerous times to enquire but nobody answered our calls
- when we went to reception they didn‚Äôt know what had happened and advised we eat in the restaurant. A good half an hour wasted - time we didn‚Äôt have to spare.
- The breakfast room was very busy with non hotel guests coming in off the street being served teas and coffees!
- No porridge available for the runners so we had to buy instant porridge from the local Centra shop and eat it in the room 

If this hotel is going to hike up prices for an event such as the marathon then they should cater to runners needs - the most important of which is a good breakfast on the morning of the run.

To top it all off we had to pay an additional ‚Ç¨30 car park fee in addition to the ‚Ç¨330 we had paid for the room.",2,2018,10,29
215,Very central,"Smart clean hotel
Nothing too extravagant but the rooms are large and well presented 
Small bar and breakfast area but then your out on the town mainly
Central top everywhere so you can walk and be in the midst of it all very quickly
Sensibly proiced",4,2018,10,29
215,What a fantastic hotel!,"This is the second time that I have visited Dublin and stayed at this hotel.

For me there has been nothing to complain or be negative about.

The Alex is situated centrally which is great for the tourist amongst us. It‚Äôs a great looking hotel and very welcoming.

The inside is contemporary with great fixtures and fittings.

The reception area is manned by a wonderful group of welcoming and friendly staff. We were dealt with promptly and with a smile. 

Our room was clean a spacious with a super king size bed. Lovely clean bathroom and coffee and tea making facilities.

We had breakfast included. There was a great variety of food to choose from and the staff in the restaurant were a friendly happy bunch who couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. The restaurant was clean and tidy and this high standard was kept up.

The staff on the front desk were very helpful and informative when it came to our enquiries about getting around the city and there were plenty of travel guides to choose from too.

All in all a fabulous hotel that I would use again and again.

Thank you the Alex for a great time!",5,2018,10,25
215,Comfortable & Convenient,"The hotel and rooms were just fine. Clean and updated. The biggest negative was the front desk, particularly the tall gentleman that seems to be there all the time. He was quick and short making us want to avoid him. However he seemed to be the only one around to ask even the simplest questions. One of the evenings we arrived back from an evening at the pubs and wanting to order food, we were told there was a problem with the kitchen and no room service was available. Would have been nice if they offered us an alternative, had snacks or information on ordering delivery to the hotel. We liked the location everything we wanted to do was an easy walk. If you want something reasonable, clean, comfortable without the customer service this hotel is just fine.",3,2018,10,22
215,Modern and Comfortable in Dublin,"Stayed here for three nights, found the location ideal for wandering and seeing the sights. Steps from Trinity College, other historic locations, as well as in a great shopping and eating area. Walkable to St. Stephen's Green, tea at the Shelbourne, the Little Museum, and the bus stop for the hop-on hop-off tour bus. Nice sized rooms and baths, big screen TV, lots of outlets and USB slots, overhead shower as well as handheld. Some things that could be better: hooks or bars in the bathroom to hold clothing or wet towels; service in the bar/restaurant could be better in the evening.",4,2018,10,21
215,I can‚Äôt wait to come back,I haven‚Äôt even checked out yet and I‚Äôm already planning my next stay here.  The room was a lot bigger then expected and the decor is lovley. Really lovely shower and massive comfy bed.  Everything is a short walk away an it‚Äôs not to busy around the hotel. Love the hotel love the location love Dublin,5,2018,10,21
215,"Wonderful stay at a nice hotel, conveniently located in the city.","The staff at the hotel was very friendly, they helped me retrieving my passport which I forgot in the taxi to the hotel. They helped looking for solutions and in the end it worked out. The hotel itself is nice and modern. Spacious lobby, the location is very convenient if you need to be at Trinity at some point. 

The only thing I disliked a bit, was the cramped restaurant for the breakfast. The tables and chairs are very close together, which makes you sit uncomfortably close to your neigbor, who you probably do not know.",4,2018,10,20
215,Lovely Hotel,"I was impressed with the larger than expected size of the room, particularly the bath. The room was also spotless and the bed was very comfortable. My only concern was hearing other guests through the thin walls. The staff, from reception to the lounge and restaurant, were always professional and went out of their way to be accommodating. I look forward to my next visit.",4,2018,10,18
215,First time user and visit to Ireland. Staff very helpful Recommend highly,The location of the property was excellent to tour the greater Dublin Ireland area. Mostly walking distance to the most popular attractions. Lots of choices for entertainment close by. We walked mostly and felt very comfortable with the surroundings. Recommend this location to all.,5,2018,10,17
215,Good food. Good staff. Nice rooms,"Great location. It's centrally-located and an easy walk to Trinity College, Book of Kells, and even the famous sites donwtown. They have a nice cafe called STEAM at the corner and good coffee also in the restaurant.
Breakfast is very good and you can request for eggs--any which way you want.",5,2018,10,14
215,Great Location,My husband and I went to Dublin to visit our daughter who is living there for a year. We had chosen another hotel closer to her home but were unable to get in there so our second choice was The Alex. It definitely was not as second choice hotel. Very clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly. Breakfast every morning was delicious. It is very centrally situated. A short walk or cab ride to everything we wanted to do. Would stay here again whether we could get into the hotel closer to her or not.,5,2018,10,08
215,Great customer service,"We had a great 3 night stay at the Alex. The key point to mention is how accommodating we found the staff. When we checked in, Vjeko was particularly helpful. He jumped right in and made us dinner reservations for 2 nights and worked to get us reservations at one of the attractions.",5,2018,10,08
215,Clean and Comfortable,"The Alex is approximately a 20-25 minute walk from the Temple Bar area. Not bad, but a little far to do once or twice a day. That being said, it‚Äôs much quieter than other areas of City Center since there are crowds in the streets of Dublin well into the night. Location is ok, depending on what you want to do. Other pros: friendly staff, decent coffee, USB ports next to both beds, and the shower temperature controls are awesome. There is internet TV and the beds are comfy. If you book on the hotel website, you get a free gift. We chose a complimentary cocktail. Cons: breakfast buffet was unimpressive, coffee in the room isn‚Äôt great, there aren‚Äôt hooks for towels in the bathroom (why??). Overall, it‚Äôs a decent place with friendly and helpful staff. I would probably stay closer to the Temple Bar area next time but would still recommend.",4,2018,10,07
215,Classy Hotel in Superb Location,So often in Dublin and my first time staying in The Alex and I certainly will be back. It‚Äôs location is unreal as is the hotel itself. My room was very spacious with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Classy decor with a gorgeous bathroom and cleanliness was 15 out of 10!! A credit to the hous keeping department. The breakfast selection is as good as any hotel that I have stayed in and everything was gorgeous and fresh. All the staff that I came in contact with were so warm and friendly and I simply could not describe how important that is for me. In actual fact the staff are the making of any hotel so keep up the good work. The bar is lovely and the hotel offers a very varied menu of food throughout the day and night. No doubt in my mind as a regular visitor to Dublin I have found my new home away from home and my wife also loved it especially because of it wonderful location . I will be back very soon. Continued success to the O Callaghan Family and all your wonderful staffüëçüëçüòéüòéüáÆüá™üáÆüá™,5,2018,10,01
215,Niceset Coffee in Dublin at Steam Caf√©,"As it's International Coffee Day, a couple of colleagues and I decided to head out of the office for a cuppa and a few people had mentioned the quality of the baristas in the newly-renovated caf√© on the side of the Alex Hotel near Merrion Square so we popped in and were welcomed with a warm smile an even warmer brew of Cloud Picker, brewed to perfection and with a nice almond croissant, we'll be back for sure as I don;t think I've had a coffee this good in Dublin for quite some time, I'm definitely a Steam convert!",5,2018,10,01
215,Cousins Trip,"This lovely boutique hotel is within walking distance of many of Dublin's attractions.  The hotel is comfortable and clean.  Loved the bathroom and the USB port next to the bed.  Bed was comfy and we made good use of the chair with stool/table.  Nothing fancy, just lovely and serviceable.  Would definitely stay again.  Good breakfast and lunch",4,2018,09,22
215,Great Hotel,"Two couples spent 6 nights here last week and we all greatly enjoyed the newly renovated hotel and the fine staff. Nicole and Simone at the front desk were a great help with everything from tour advice to directions and all hotel services. We are very pleased with the high level of service at The Alex.

Rooms are spacious and baths are new and well appointed. Best shower setup I‚Äôve seen in sometime. Breakfast buffet is excellent. Get it included in your room deal. It‚Äôs well worth it. 

The location of The Alex is also excellent. Just behind Trinity College on the opposite side of Temple Bar. Very quiet area in the evening but a close walk to everything in Dublin. Excellent food in the pubs nearby. The Alex far exceeded my expectations.",5,2018,09,18
215,Honeymoon Stay!,It was a beautiful hotel! The staff was absolutely excellent. We received bites of a chocolate brownie dessert in our room when we arrived. We were a little disappointed that the king size bed was just two twin beds pushed together... that made it a little less comfortable laying with one another on our honeymoon. The food and drinks were amazing from the restaurant! The breakfast had so many options and our sharing platter in the evening was delicious! The room was beautiful... well the entire hotel was! Definitely glad we stayed there and would recommend it to some friends who are visiting! We stayed there off of someone else‚Äôs recommendation actually!  So happy with it!,5,2018,09,18
215,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Stayed here recently with a group of travel agents, and we had a great experience at the Alex.

It's in a fantastic location, minutes from Grafton Street and the station.
The decor of the Alex is very trendy, modern with a retro touch and the staff are very friendly and efficient.
Breakfast was small but with plenty of delicious options.

Rooms are spacious and very clean, and have lots of fun quirky touches, like a retro radio and phone, and a beautiful bathroom.
Loved the fact that whoever designed the rooms remembered the power/usb outlets next to the bed, and the shower controls are on the OPPOSITE side to the shower head, avoiding that awful moment when you have to stand under freezing cold water while working out the temperature controls. Much appreciated.

Overall we had a great stay at the Alex, and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a modern yet friendly hotel in Dublin.",5,2018,09,12
215,"Lovely room, perfect location, amazing service, minor annoyances","The hotel appears to have been renovated recently, and it is a mid-century modern delight. The service was impeccable, and the location was amazing. There are, however, a few tiny things I wish could be changed. For example, there is no place to hang a towel in the bathroom. There are no recycling bins in the room, so papers and bottles have to be put in the garbage, and there isn't a luggage rack. Some of these might be cultural (perhaps recycling is more Canadian than Irish, and perhaps most people unpack their suitcase fully). But these little things are available in most hotels at this price range in most countries to which I have traveled. Still, I would return! ",5,2018,09,11
215,Great hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights. Only setback is that theres not many choices of restaurants unless you head towards temple bar. Otherwise a really nice place to stay. The rooms were spacious and clean. Definitely would recommend to others & would most definitely come back,4,2018,09,09
215,Nice hotel and centrally located,We just spent one night at the Alex before leaving the country. The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. They also put out a very nice breakfast spread. It is centrally located if you are planning to explore Dublin.,4,2018,09,06
215,Well worth a go,"Great hotel, stylish rooms with plenty of space. All staff helpful and tasty breakfast. Would recommend to all my friends and family and would certainly stay again. Parking a little bit fiddly but it‚Äôs a town centre hotel so can‚Äôt complain too much",5,2018,09,05
215,Fantastic stay - thanks to kind and attentive Loredana! ,"I could not thank Loredana and the rest of the Alex‚Äô personnel for the most wonderful and peaceful night that I spent at this beautiful hotel! 
All I ask for when I travel across the Atlantics is a good night sleep. And they delivered:
- Loredana was very kind to give me a quiet room;
- Hotel has most comfortable beds;
- Its location is close to all the attractions but far enough to have a quality sleep;
- it‚Äôs newly renovated and stylish, yet classy 
Thank you so much!

215,Boutique hotel recently restyled at convenient location,"I've spent one night at The Alex hotel in August for business purpose and was very pleased with the spacious room,  king size bed and bathroom.  I had a room overlooking backside of hotel but it was very silent and I could even sleep with open window. As this hotel is centrally located, you can walk to lots of places in Dublin.  Breakfast buffet included good quality bread and pastries. My freshly baked omelette was delicious. Staff at reception desk was very friendly. I would certainly return.",5,2018,08,27
215,Little bit Fawlty Towers,"So look.. this is generally a nice hotel in a nice location with decent rooms. But jeez I wish they'd get more of the basics right. I'm staying here now for one night and all I want above sleep is

1. A quick drink at the bar
2. Decent wifi so I can send some emails
3. Lights to work in the room

Doesn't seem too onerous but all three of those things were difficult / not available. 

Won't bore anyone with the details but I hope the hotel mgmt take on board feedback provided and just generally step up. Oh and just checked... I'm paying 195 euros for the night so not like it's cheap..",2,2018,08,22
215,Quiet Drink before Last Train,"The Alex is located quite close to Pearse Street train station and is ideally located for a quiet drink before catching the last train home.  Great bar with huge selection of gins, well presented with a good choice of tonics",4,2018,08,19
215,Awesome Hotel,"Stayed in July 2018 with my daughter on our first trip to Ireland.  The hotel was clean and throughly updated had a mid-century modern vibe to it.  The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful - we even dealt with a lovely young man who is from our hometown in Canada (small world).  The room was large and really nicely decorated.  Tons of built in storage for unpacking, mini fridge, USB ports for charging, air conditioning (which was great as it was hot when we were there), window that opened to let in fresh air, lovely large bathroom with great rain head shower, plenty of vanity space as well.  Loved the hotel - only ate in the coffee shop (but had a delicious muffin for breakfast).  Quiet location with a great pub next door, The Ginger Man where we had excellent fish and chips and a pint of Bulmers!  The only downside is that it is a fair walk to all the sights (which is great when you're starting out but we'd come from a week of walking in the UK) so we took cabs on our returns which was easy and fun (Irish cabbies are so entertaining).  Loved the old library (trinity college), Grafton Street was fun with the regular tourist shops, highly recommend Kilkenny Shop on Nassau St for amazing local Irish gifts (pottery, artwork, etc).  Loved the live music at Oliver St.John Gogartys (temple bar area) and can't say enough about the tour and tasting at the Irish Whiskey Museum other than you should go it was super interesting and fun (and I don't even like whiskey).",5,2018,08,16
215,Very Good Stay,"Very nice hotel, in a good location, close to Hop On Hop Off bus stop. The area is quiet with several pubs and stores. The room was nicely furnished, although there were a few problems with keys and bathroom. All handled promptly by the hotel staff.",4,2018,08,15
215,Lovely stay,"Beautifully decorated, bit of a 1950s modern feel to it. All staff very friendly, only had breakfast here but he buffet style was fo good quality and very enjoyable. We stayed in a classic king room & it was very spacious, very comfy beds & the shower is of very high quality aswell. Complementary coffee machine usage in the room aswell. ",5,2018,08,13
215,"Excellent stay.  Hotel is very 'fresh'.  All amenities are there,","Room was very well decked out.  Good comfortable beds, with an air-con that worked (a godsend during this hot summer!).  Location was a close to Trinity College and the main areas of interest.  Shame there was not a rooftop garden for smokers.  Would suggest management also put some more hooks in the bathrooms, particularly above the opaque glass of the bathroom door (so one can hang a towel!); and any chance to negotiate a hotel rate for the car parking?  It cost me EUR 25 for 25 hours....

Particular thanks to Carlo, the night manager, who saved my holiday by retrieving (and storing) my passport and money pouch from the room safe, where I had left them prior to driving to County Clare!  Great service!",5,2018,08,13
215,Amazing Hotel,"Beautiful hotel in a quiet but centrally located location in Dublin.  The staff was very pleasant and did everything to make sure our stay was perfect.  Simona is a such a gem, so nice and helpful giving us all kinds of tips and suggestions and going above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.   Rooms are spacious, modern, quiet and very comfortable.  Highly Recommend.",5,2018,08,11
215,Excellent Location,"We selected the Alex for its central location and reviews that it was a quiet hotel, which in Dublin is a rare thing as the city is quite vibrant. On the quiet front the Alex delivered. The hotel is well-appointed and has air-conditioning which is a major benefit when Dublin is hot. The rooms are stylish and hip. It is a nice interpretation of a old building gets new life. I found the decor to be thoughtful and made our stay enjoyable. 

Where they did not get 5 stars was in the service. The front desk person was curt with us and made an awful first impression. He was so rude that we wanted to check out before we even checked in. There is also a general lack staffing. For a busy hotel there was never anyone to help. They do not have a valet so you are required to self-park. That is totally fine, but the front desk person was unwilling to give us directions and the Alex is located in a triangle of tangled streets. I am from Boston so I am familiar with confusing intersections, but the Alex needs to do more to help guests find the hidden parking garage--even though to locals it is close. Another troubling point was there is no bellhop or anyone to help with luggage. I watched traveler after traveler struggle to get their bags up the stairs and through the front door of the hotel.

Where the Alex gained our repeat business, despite the concerns listed above, was in the management team. When we expressed our concerns to a manager on duty he was understanding and responsive. He went out of his way to make our stay memorable. He has our gratitude for turning around the vibe of our stay and his actions are what will make us gladly return to this hotel.  I felt the management at the Alex is professional and worthy of 5-stars; I am hopeful the front desk staff will get the same training in hospitality.",4,2018,08,04
215,Much better than I was expecting,"This hotel was fantastic.  It was the first hotel on our 2 week tour and after our long travel from Texas the clean,  large, king bed was VERY welcomed.  Breakfast was great.  Bar drinks were very expensive, so I would go to the pub across the street if you want to have a few. ",5,2018,08,03
215,"Clean, modern, decent location","The room was big and clean and I liked the modern decor. The bed and the pillows were comfortable. The bathroom was nice and I enjoyed the rain shower, although the water pressure was poor. The breakfast was a traditional Irish one. Nothing particularly impressive but edible. The hotel staff were friendly and extremely helpful but unfortunately the information leaflet in the room was not up-to-date; they claimed to have a guest computer in the lobby but such thing did not exist when I asked about it. We had booked our room early and asked for a quiet room if possible but were given a room on the side of Fenian street that had a construction site at the time.

One morning 8 a.m. (!) we were awakened by a staff member (a cleaner, I assume) entering our room while we were still sleeping - naked, if I may add, which made it extremely awkward. This was not the nicest way to wake up and we were startled by it. We had not put the ‚Äùplease do not disturb‚Äù sign on our door for the night because I think it should be safe for a guest to assume that the cleaners would not start so early, and the leaflet in the room also stated that the sign was needed only during the day. I travel a lot and nothing like this has ever happened to me and it was honestly horrible. I doubt that this happens routinely, though, because no other review has mentioned it. Perhaps we were just unlucky.

I recommend the Alex and might stay there again.",4,2018,08,01
215,Good business stay,"The recent refurbishment has turned this into a stylish hotel well situated in Dublin. My room was comfortable and modern. Bathrooms were very clean and the bed comfortable. I didn't eat in the hotel, but the staff I encountered were pleasant. ",4,2018,07,31
215,Great after renovation ,"Such comfortable rooms , great shower and facilities. Had a good breakfast and loved the eggs made on order. Very warm welcome although in the middle of the night. And not last.. Location location location! ",5,2018,07,29
215,Fine stay overall but missed the mark a bit,"The Alex is centrally located, walking distance to just about anything you might want to see in Dublin. The hotel is very clean and updated. The carpark is just down the road and is easy enough to use.

There are two reasons for the ""average"" rating. 1) The staff at the front desk were not warm or friendly. The man who checked us told me multiple times he did not have our reservation in a cold and unfriendly way. I had all the documentation which only made him shrug his shoulders and flip through the pages of his book in an aggravated manner. Once he found our reservation, he offered no apology. 2) As mentioned above the rooms were quite clean and well maintained but the bed was a disaster.It was a king bed made by pushing two singles together, which often happens, but the beds were two different heights and kept separating. My husband's bed was the lower one and sagged so badly in the middle it left for an achy start to the next day. 
We travel to Ireland frequently but will surely choose another location next time as we expected a friendly face and a comfortable bed for the price we paid.",3,2018,07,25
215,Nice clean hotel & room,"Hotel was close enough to town that everything seemed to be within 10-15 minutes walking distance.  Room was very clean & spacious and modern.  Our room didn't have much of a view.  Nice restaurant & coffee shop in lobby.  We didn't eat at the restaurant but did have coffee at coffee shop.  No TV's in the lobby or restaurant.  Wanted to watch the end of the British Open, had to go a block down the street to a pub.",5,2018,07,24
215,The Penultimate Hotel of Dublin,"Though a last minute booking, this hotel exceeded all of my expectations! The Classic King hotel room was impeccably put together and nothing short of an incredible hotel experience altogether. The lights, decor, and selection of different bedding made for a very pleasurable sleep as well.

The waitstaff was remarkably respectful and accommodating of our needs while visiting, and the Alex's proximity to many of the sights and tours of Dublin made it accessible to a host of them.

The Alex's proximity to the pub, The Ginger Man was also very enjoyable with an exhaustive list of authentic, delicious pub favorites such as the traditional fish and chips and chicken and ham leek pie. The in room menu is full of decadent desserts as well as delicious standards.

When I had last visited Dublin I stayed at the Shelbourne just after it's renovation nearly 10 years ago. And as glamorous as that stay was, The Alex is every bit it's equal and in some cases it's superior in it its most recent iteration. If you're looking for fine dining, immaculate rooms with excellent bedding, and a beautiful vestibule filled with ornate lighting and design for both the common man and royalty; this might just be the place for you.",5,2018,07,24
215,Excellent Hotel,"This was my last hotel of 8 hotels in 19 days and it was really nice to have a modern hotel room complete with large tv, refrigerator, coffee pot, king size bed and it was quiet and close to everything. The only complaint was that the food in the restaurant didn't have very many food choices but there were plenty of restaurants and pubs down the street. Service was very good. Taxi from the train station costed me 11 euros but traffic was sort of slow, if you want an idea of cost from train station.",5,2018,07,21
215,Nice hotel and good location,"We stayed at this hotel at the start and the end of our tour.  Both days were good,  the breakfast was filling and the staff friendly.   We arrived early and they stored our bags until the room was ready.

The hotel is easily reached from the airport via the Airlink Bus #757.  get off at the Merrion Square stop.  Go north on Merrion Street for about 2blocks and turn right on Fenian St. the hotel is on the left. The fare was 7‚Ç¨.

The hotel is within walking distance to Trinity College.

When we left to go back to the states, we opted for a cab ride.  Hotel set it up for us and the Taxi fare was 33‚Ç¨",5,2018,07,21

The staff was very helpful and nice. The breakfast was good and convenient.
I liked the location. It was not in the busy crowded area but close enough to walk everywhere.",4,2018,07,19
215,Excellent customer service ,"I stayed at the Alex hotel for one night and the girls at the reception were very helpful and nice , they upgrade my room ,was very spacious and clean , I would recommend this hotel just because they keep up the standards and is a very handy location situated in the heart of Dublin, thanks a million for the kindness you have showed me during my stay !  See you next time .",5,2018,07,17
215,Great hotel,Great hotel. Delightful staff even at 0400 in the am!!  Good breakfasts with fast service. Nice rooms. Good concierge. Good pubs close by. Right on the hop on hop off bus.  We had 3 rooms touring with friends and family.  Good wifi,5,2018,07,17

215,Overpriced for basic facilities ,"Basics such as comfort and cleanliness were good but other facilities were poor such as no on site parking,bar and restaurant,Air conditioning, Road works outside the Hotel. I expected a lot more for the price I paid. I would not use again",2,2018,07,16
215,Disappointed visit to this hotel,"Disappointed visit to this hotel-Previously booked at the Devonport  O‚ÄôCallaghan hotel which was excellent even with all their building and refurbishment in progress. Therefore taking my son to the Alex created excitement for both of usBased on the Davenport standard.However this was sadly disappointing the minute we stepped into the hotel. 
  I paid over ¬£550 for two nights in this hotel. 
 We were greeted with a queue at reception one girl working hard the other one  systematically dissecting the map of Dublin to 2 gentlemen. This could‚Äôve been done later and the queue address first of all .
I was greeted with you have to pay ‚Ç¨64 for your breakfasts for the next two days. I was alarmed at spending so much money for the room  and then breakfast was not included. The attitude was ‚Äúit‚Äôs nothing to do with us you booked through booking.com.‚Äù As they are the hotel of choice I felt dissapointed. I attempted to book directly with  The O‚ÄôCallaghan group -Davenport ,Montclair and the Alex Their website was fully booked  I then resorted to checking trivago and booking.com came up with the room. I of course was delighted. 
However putting that aside - The evening was no better for us , two meals sent back the burger was raw in the middle and more like a Pattie and the fish and chips were as if they had ‚Äúthrown ‚Äú it in the microwave batter moist fish piping hot chips brown butuncooked in the middle - final third meal arrived substandard but edible and then they charged us to the meals. No goodwill gesture no pleasantries exchanged from the duty manager who was more hellbent on been  unprofessional  with his colleague in front of hotel guests. He stomped around like a petulant child .He spent a long time just looking at all the receipts behind the bar.-checking the takings .When the delightful member of staff from St Albans her name fails me at the moment, (who  was extremely pleasant to all guests and colleagues )assisted an elderly gentleman to his room with a tray of food the duty manager  openly questioned her in a very stern manner and chastised her in front of hotel guests .
In my Booking.com app was a food plan included. None of the hotel staff were interested in what that meant they just wanted ‚Ç¨64 from me.The duty manager told me exactly the same and was not interested
I will write to What duty manager in any courtesy assistance in this misunderstanding.
I will never stay at the Alex again. I found The weekend was ruined. It took the gloss  off the planned weekend to see Riverdance in Dublin .",1,2018,07,09
215,For the price i expected a lot better,"This hotel is clean and functional the restaurant is good (huge portions) bar is nice BUT there are things that really frustrate me with hotels and my biggest bug bear is walking in to a furnace of a room and having to start the air-condition which was useless not only did it hardly work it also timed itself to turn off and then reset to 22. I ended up having to keep my door open and open the hallway window to get a through breeze. Only one lift working, Next is not enough staff on front desk and no concierge ...i was in a hurry to check out and the people in front took ages and then wanted to book sight seeing etc ... For the price i expected better",2,2018,07,08
215,"Not enough staff, had to wait for everything","Arrived at the Alex, centrally located, nice hotel, new and modern. Painfully slow service at the desk. One room was ready, the adjoining room for my 2 teenage kids was not. Spent the day around Dublin, came back, second room was ready but the adjoining door was locked. Ok, went down to front desk because no one answered the phone after several tries. I was told only the maid staff has keys and since it was after 5, I had to wait till tomorrow. Huh? Hotel Manager doesn't have key to unlock doors in the hotel? No, only maid staff and there was nothing to be done till the morning. Weird but OK since my kids are old enough to stay by themselves. Noticed woman at reception desk made a note on a large notepad for wait staff to unlock the door at 830 in the morning. It was done at 930. Not a big deal. Went to breakfast, only 3 people working the breakfast for 8 tables and restocking the buffet so we had a small que at the bar asking for coffee service. Again, not a big deal but more waiting on my part. Had a question to ask the receptionist (regarding the locked door), she took a booking on the phone and made me wait 15 minutes, didn't even acknowledge I was standing there. Went to the bar around 515pm, waited and waited to be served by a server who acted like he didn't know how to be a waiter.
Again, nice accomodations, good location but understaffed and definitely not up to NYC hotel standards. Don't expect anyone to go out of their way to help make your stay memorable.",2,2018,07,05
215,Great facilities,"From an ultra-modern lobby, good sized room great comfortable bed, working air con, good bathroom, friendly courteous staff, good breakfast, great gym. Perfect week in Dublin right in Central area. Room was ready on arrival and check out really excellent at 12md.",5,2018,07,02
215,Good location,"The hotel was very nice and was in a good location to explore the city. There is a bus from the airport that drops you off almost right next to the hotel. The main attractions are within a 15-20 minute walk of the hotel. The room was spacious and there were a lot of outlets. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and would stay here again.",5,2018,07,02
215,The Sweetest Sleep,"Great hotel & Centrally located.

I don‚Äôt think we have ever slept in such comfortable hotel beds. After a long journey and trying to battle jet lag, the sleep and rest we were able to get at the Alex was perfect. 

Rooms are clean and showers are great. 

Staff are all friendly and helpful. The gentlemen at reception are great. 

Wifi is not the greatest and kept cutting out. 

If I was to be really picky, my only critiques would be:

1 - For breakfast it would be nice to have an egg station or an option to order something from the kitchen aside from the buffet scrambled eggs

2 - For the price per you pay per night, the bathroom cosmetics / accessories are basic and it would be nice to have bars of soap.",5,2018,06,28
215,Good central hotel,"The Alex is a newly refurbished (and renamed) hotel a few minutes walk from Merrion Square and within walking distance of a lot of the tourist sights. It has some sister hotels close by. 

Rooms are of a good standard and are what you would expect of a four star hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. ",4,2018,06,26
215,Great Place To Stay,We went with friends for a long weekend in Dublin. We chose Alex because of reviews we had read and were not disappointed. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the hotel was very clean. The staff were pleasant and helpful and always had a smile for you.Breakfast were good and a varied choice for all.The Alex was in a great situation for us as we were able to walk to the sight seeing areas around Dublin. We would certainly stay again in the Alex if we return to Dublin,5,2018,06,25
215,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","Had a great weekend here in December for my birthday and anniversary. The room was very clean and beds comfortable. 

Breakfast didn‚Äôt have the usual Irish warm welcome to it, staff were a little cold and the food took a while to come out. Staff also had a very public argument one evening which was really unprofessional (I believe a superior was challenging a waiter who had been working very hard servicing dinner in pressured circumstances so we felt bad for him).

Parking is a bit tricky to find and very limited, however to have any parking at all in Dublin Centre is a miracle, so that‚Äôs a definitely positive.",4,2018,06,17
215,Great hotel,We stayed at The Alex this past Thursday and just left today. The hotel itself is beautiful! The girl at the front desk was not very pleasant however the rest of the staff were very friendly. The rooms are spacious and they also had classical music playing in the room upon arrival. It was a very nice touch. The shower is fantastic! It was very hot & the water pressure was perfect. I could have stayed in it all day! The location of the hotel is very close to a lot of good pubs. We will definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin!,4,2018,06,17
215,Dublin Visit,"The Alex is centrally located to the Dublin City Center.  A newer hotel that is clean, convenient and comfortable with up to date amenities. Rooms have charging stations bedside, rain shower head, personal safe and mini fridge in rooms.   Enjoyable stay, will visit The Alex again when in Dublin!",5,2018,06,10
215,A Great Time,"So so pleased with this hotel selection.  The refreshed property is an excellent location and value in comparison to other offerings in Dublin.  The room was very spacious, clean, and well appointed.  Noise was controlled better than expected for a refurbished building, bathroom ventilation was extremely poor  - a steamy mess - desk made adjustments to central system with little benefit.  Place for towels would have reduced  my  need for daily replenishment. Otherwise, a wonderful, comfortable stay.  Enjoy!",4,2018,06,10
215,Perfect spot,"Our room at the Alex was clean, quiet, and convenient.  The Alex is perfectly located, close to Dublin sights but located just away from all the noise of the city.  Personnel were very nice at reception and the bar.  We did not eat any meals so cannot rate that facility.  All in all, enjoyed our stay there during the heat wave.",4,2018,06,08
215,Great Hotel,"Really great hotel. The bedroom was huge and clean. The room was really comfortable. The staff was nice and polite, and the food was really good too. I had a really good stay at this hotel and would go back. ",5,2018,06,06
215,Great stay,"We stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay.  The rooms were very nice and comfortable, the staff was very attentive, and we could walk to most of the places we wanted to see.  The breakfast was good, as were the one lunch and one dinner we had there.  We had drinks and Stephanie was great and made the best Irish Coffee we had in our whole 2 week trip!  ",5,2018,06,04
215,Heart of Dublin,Terrific location‚Äî-in the heart of Dublin.  We walked everywhere.  Nice facilities and included air conditioning (which is not usually available). The staff was amazing and so helpful.  Will definitely stay again.,5,2018,05,31
215,Nice hotel in Dublin,"We found the Alex to be spacious, modern, and clean. It‚Äôs within walking distance of several Dublin points of interest - Trinity College, St Stephens Green and Grafton street. There‚Äôs also a really good pub next door (Ginger Man). My only complaint was upon checkin. After flying all night and arriving tired the next morning we were told our room wouldn‚Äôt be ready until 3 pm. Ok. Not a problem. However, if we wanted to pay extra Euros we could get a room immediately. I didn‚Äôt really care for that. I went ahead and paid the upcharge because we were exhausted and wanted to rest and freshen up. I felt a little taken advantage of.",4,2018,05,28
215,Nice and updated,"Stayed for four nights in May, my husband and I in one room and our teenage girls in another.  The hotel has been recently updated which is very nice.  The bed and bedding was very comfortable.  The rooms are a bit warm but the window does open allowing us to cool it down.  It is about 8 min walk to Grafton and less than 15 min to Temple bar area.  I have only two minor complaints, neither of which would keep me from returning.  First, the laundry says same day return if dropped off by 8am but when I talked to the desk it is actually next day.   Not a big deal but did prevent me from getting my laundry done.  The second is that the bar area really feels like the breakfast area, which it is but who wants to hang out for a pint at the end of the night in a brightly lit area.  I would return if we come back to Dublin.",4,2018,05,25
215,Fantastic service at hotel bar,"First time to in Ireland. Had a rough day of travel coming in. The bartender, Stephanie, made us feel right at home and gave some great suggestions for the city. If we meet people who show us this kindness for the rest of our trip, might never leave this place. Would highly recommend. ",5,2018,05,24
215,Memorable stay,Having mistakingly booked at St Steven's Green O Callaghan's who refused to let me cancel after discovering all the renovations taking place; their Manager arranged a quick transfer and upgrade for me at the sister hotel  The Alex on the opposite side of the Green. I was given an executive suite and oh my was  it brilliant. With the icy weather and a hectic time in London ahead I could easily have just relaxed in my suite! Excellent housekeeping while the breakfast was really very average. With many good restaurants and Temple Bar Area  nearby I never dined at the hotel. Really friendly front office crew who bent over backwards to help me with URGENT work stuff I had to process.  Truly a memorable stay!,4,2018,05,24
215,The ‚ÄúNew‚Äù improved Alex!,"About 7 years ago was my first stay at The Alexander. I just got back from a stay at The Alex with my small group of 12 and I must say, what a change! The hotel always had a great location but now the ‚ÄúNew Improved‚Äù Alex matches the perfect location! Loved it! We were greeted by the Front Office Manager, Francesco Cuscito and nothing we asked was too much for him. The check in was so smooth, the rooms were lovely and the breakfast wonderful. The Alex is definitely my hotel of choice in Dublin for all my clients!",5,2018,05,21
215,Not trying to hard,"Good location, nice hotel.  But he service was mediocre.

At both check in and check out it seemed that the staff didn‚Äôt have a clue what they were doing. And we had to cancel a taxi request 50 minutes in, after the front desk had repeated several times, that the driver was 5-10 minutes away. We called our own taxi that arrived within 3 minutes.",3,2018,05,20
215,Lovely stay and a nice hotel...until check out,"To start with the positives. We arrived at about midday to drop our bags prior to a three night stay at The Alex. First impressions were very good. The receptionist (working 17/05) was welcoming and helpful, providing us with a map and suggestions of where to walk to kill time until the room became available. 

The hotel has recently been refurbished and we thought it looked great. Really well designed and finished, and the room was lovely. Good size, rain shower, Nespresso coffee, water etc. Couldn‚Äôt ask for more, and a great location to base yourselves for a few days in Dublin. Breakfast (included in our rate) was very good, with cooked and continental options and very friendly staff. 

Unfortunately all pleasantries of the hotel itself were severely soured by the check out process and service provided. We sought to check out the evening before our last night, as we had a very early flight in the morning. The receptionist mentioned a figure in excess of our booked rate/total, but my pre-authorised card was immediately charged. I was not given an invoice to review prior to being billed (which is typical in every hotel I have ever stayed in). The hotel had added breakfast to our bill despite it being included in our rate. 

Needless to say I challenged the additional cost. The night manager (working 19/05) queried where I had booked, and was very disparaging when I said hotels.com. I was told the reference number I had wasn‚Äôt their reference number (yet our booking was clearly on the system at check-in), and that I‚Äôd have to take it up with hotels.com!  This was clearly their error, and had double charged for breakfast. 

Further discussions with the condescending night manager and receptionist ensued and I was told a refund would not be possible without calling the reservations team. Had it not been late at night, with a very early wake up call I think I‚Äôd still be disputing it, as I cannot understand how a hotel can overcharge and process the transaction having not allowed a customer to confirm the amount first. 

To make matters worse, upon reviewing the receipt it turns out I was billed in GBP as opposed to EUR, adding a further 3.5% fee to the cost. Again, I was not asked what currency to be billed in, but instead just immediately charged. 

Regardless of who your customers book through, we are still your customers. This service was unprofessional, rude, and a very disappointing end to the holiday. I am awaiting a satisfactory resolution and refund at the very least. ",3,2018,05,20
215,Attentive and superb service,"I got in late and my luggage was lost ... didn‚Äôt have anything with me and was kinda stressed out. The staff at The Alex was so helpful to me. Shoutout to Dylan, who tried his best to find a store that would be open late at night, and finally found a solution for me to go to a store that opens up early next morning. He didn‚Äôt just say, ‚Äúsorry I don‚Äôt know‚Äù, but he went out on a limb to help me find the information I needed. And Conor helped me to print out everything I need for my meeting the next day. This is what separates great service from average service. They really want you to feel well while you‚Äôre here. My miserable night was better because of you. Thanks to the staff at Alex.",5,2018,05,14
215,Stylish and comfortable hotel - 100% recommended,"Stayed at The Alex for one week and can 100% recommend this hotel. 
The staff is very friendly; the location is good; it‚Äôs a stylish decorated hotel; the rooms are very comfortable and are of good size.  
Most important: the bed! It is just fantastic and you get a very good night sleep.
Last but not least: When it comes to hotel cleanliness, then I can only speak very positive and give the highest score.
All in all a great experience and I would definitely come back once I am in Dublin again.",5,2018,05,13
215,The good and bad.,"The hotel is in a very good location within walking distance to Trinity College, Archeological Museum and Art Museum.  Had a huge room w/king bed, good reading lights (hurray), very dark and quiet.  Nice walk-in shower with rain head; however, varying  temperature of water and no hand holds and floor was slippery.    Excellent maid service.  The bad - no A/C or not on.  Had problems with staff.  Our tour group was staying at Cassidy's, but we stayed at the Alex as we remained three extra days in Dublin.  The cab from Cassidy's to the Alex cost 8 euros.  When we had the Alex front desk call us a taxi to return for our farewell dinner, it cost 14 euros.  So don't know if they are getting a kickback or we just got gouged.  Cab back from Cassidys was also 8 euros.  We had access to the executive lounge.  On our last two days the snack tray was empty.  One day there was no water in the coffee machine.  One day only 2 white wines in the refrigerator.  I filled it up w/wine from the shelf above.  Next day - no wine at all.  Went to reception and asked for a free glass from the bar.  The bartender gave the staff person who took me to the bar and me a hard time about it, but finally got a glass.  Bathroom - no hooks to hang up anything - PJs, makeup bag, damp towels.  WIFI was free, but sporadic.  Often didn't connect, usually had to sign in again upon return even though autoconnect had been selected.",3,2018,05,07
215,"Kevin C - The Alex, Dublin - first time visitor, wonderful hotel, friendly city, Irish weather even cooperated","High compliments to the staff, special nod of appreciation to house manager Francesco and Paloma on front desk. Francesco went out of his way, provided local insight to the city and surrounding area ‚Äì almost like having a personal concierge. 

The Alex hotel (former Alexander), recently completed an extensive updating and renovation, stylish and clean design elements in our room and public areas. Our 6th floor room was modern, excellent wi-fi, spacious, functional with the added benefit of a concierge lounge for complimentary coffee and open bar. Fortunately renovations had been completed by time of our arrival ‚Äì no construction issues as previous reviews cited. Although we did not take advantage of onsite restaurant for lunch or dinner (many good options in the neighborhood), we enjoyed excellent breakfast buffet options, cheerful and welcoming wait staff. Located near Merrion Square, convenient to mass transit, many local dining options - would definitely consider a repeat visit to The Alex on our next trip to Ireland.",5,2018,05,06
215,What a fantastic hotel! ,"We stayed at the hotel for a long weekend.  I personally couldn't find fault with the hotel at all!  The staff on the front desk were polite and helpful and always accompanied by a small.  The hotel was spotless which lots of room to sit down.  The lift was also spotless.  Our room was amazing!  A king size bed,  large wall mounted TV with access to British TV channels.  The decor was clean and modern. The lighting was nice and soft which I like.  Again,  the bathroom was spotless and spacious with a great shower. The location is fairly central which suited us. The breakfast was great with lots of variety.  The waiting staff could not be more helpful and always cheerful.  It was truly a delightful hotel.  We loved it so much we are hoping to stay there again in October. ",5,2018,05,06
215,A really good property and location,"My husband found this hotel when doing his usual pre-trip investigation and I'm delighted he did. That said, there are some things that could have made my review a 5/5. 

The location was good, not far from Pearse Station, Merrion Square, and many of the sites you'll want to visit. We managed to find many good local pubs and the location being near Merrion Square means that it's a good spot to pick up the Hop On/Hop Off buses and to get dropped by the AirLink 757 from the airport.

We purchased the early check-in and were greeted very warmly by reception. The property is elegant, the washrooms modern with rain shower, the room large with adequate seating to relax. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the TV was well located, there were several places to plug in our phones and iPads, and our room on the 6th Floor (room 600) was easily accessed by two good elevators. 

As many visitors fly into Dublin at odd hours, silence is valued. This is one problem I had with the hotel, specifically that the doors to the rooms slammed so very loud that we were regularly awoken throughout sleeping hours. We were located next to the Executive Lounge, which created a greater frequency of slamming. The slamming was jarring, even after we were used to it. We wore earplugs and put on the white noise app to drown out the sound, but it couldn't drown out the slam. That said, other than that noise, the hotel was quiet. We didn't hear noises around us other than the doors.

With respect to the Executive Lounge, it was a tad disappointing. The first night I noticed three mini bottles of wine and grabbed one together with a wine glass. That was the only time during our visit that I saw wine, in spite of asking the hotel to refresh the stock. In addition, at times there were a few single-size bags of chips and popcorn but then they disappeared and were partially restocked three days later. There was water only once in the fridge, although there were plenty of non-alcoholic soda options. I believe that they need to service the room more frequently to make it of any real value.

While I didn't eat in the restaurant, we did pop in and found the staff excellent. This was no different than the rest of our visit, where staff members were professional, respectful and helpful. 

I would have no hesitation staying at The Alex again, although I would try to find a room at the opposite end of the hall to minimize the disruption from the slamming. I also may not stay on the Executive Floor as I'm not convinced of its value, but it may have been just a short-term issue with staffing.",4,2018,04,30
215,Excellent Hotel,"Such a great hotel,we stayed here for 3 nights for my partners 39th, the hotel looks fantastic from the outside and is the same inside.
The ladies who checked us in were lovely and as we arrived early they put our luggage into a room while we went into the town centre. 
The rooms are very spacious and the beds are so comfy and very big,we had a king size room and could have easily fitted 3 in the bed, a lovely big TV in room,nice and clean bathroom and room,fridge,ironing board and iron in room. Room was made up each day and was given fresh towels each time and als fresh soap,shampoo etc each day.
Hotel is in a great location,only a 15 minute walk into the centre and and a 2 minute walk to the bus stop which takes you there also.
There are pubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk to the hotel also.
I would definately stay here again if we return to Dublin in the future.
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2018,04,29
215,Accommodation?,"We just landed taking a 7 hour flight and arrived at the Alex hotel at 12:30pm. A little jet lagged but ready to start out adventure in Dublin. Although we arrived at 12:30pm and our check in was at 3:30pm, our room was ready but only for 25 euro an hour before check in. I've never been to a hotel that does not accomadate if the room is available. I wouldn't rate that 4.5 star accomdation.",2,2018,04,28
215,"Great hotel, amazing service","I slept at the Alex on the night of 21 April. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance from Merrion Sq. Park and the National Gallery. I had booked a Classic Room, but upon check-in, something utterly unexpected happened. They decided to upgrade me free-of-charge to an amazing suite on the fourth floor. The room was stunning, featuring a large bathroom with shower and as well as a bathtub, with a wide gamut of products to choose from (shampoo, shower gel etc.), a super-large bed and, in a different room, an almost never-ending sofa with a big flat-screen television in front of it, a table with two seats, and a large section including both a wardrobe (with complimentary bathrobe and slippers) and coffee-making facilities (Nespresso-lovers, anyone?). In addition, the room was silent and I had an excellent sleep. I would like to emphasise Francesco's professionalism and kindness, as he supervised my check-in operations. If you are thinking about a nice Dublin spell, spare a thought for the Alex, a hotel I was most pleased to stay at.",5,2018,04,22
215,Helpful front of house staff,"Having previously stayed in The Alex's sister hotel, the O'Callaghan Davenport, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised to be met at the front desk by Simona, who had been working on reception in the Davenport during our last trip to Dublin.

Although on both occasions our visits coincided with construction work or loud, early morning drilling, Simona was polite, warmly welcoming and incredibly helpful.

Our stays at the Davenport and the Alex were to celebrate a birthday and wedding anniversary respectively. Both times, when Simona discovered the reasons for our being there, she was sure to lay on a little something extra to enhance the experience. She is an excellent ambassador for your hotel.",3,2018,04,21
215,Lovely Hotel in Great Location,"Really loved this hotel.  It is very centrally located so easy to get to all the main tourist attractions and is also right by one of the airport shuttle bus stops so really easy to get to.  The hotel has clearly been recently renovated and it was beautifully decorated, very clean and the amenities great.  We had a club room lounge on the 5th floor which was well proportioned, not huge but plenty of space with an enormous super king bed which was amazingly comfortable.  The room was well equipped with plenty 0f lug sockets in the places required (one of my personal bugbears) with a small seating area, dressing table/desk and dressing area with wardrobes.  There was a hairdryer, iron and ironing board and in room safe provided with in room tea and coffee etc.
The bathroom was spotless with a super double shower area with both standard shower and rain shower options.
As we were in a club room we had access to the executive club room where tea/coffee, soft drinks and mixers and wine were available at no charge.
The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the reception staff who were very knowledgeable about the area and very happy to help with directions, car hire, bookings and advice.
We had breakfast at the hotel once which was buffet style offering full Irish breakfast or continental options.  The food was lovely and the staff friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was a little pricey at 17 euros but to be honest probably in line with Dublin hotel prices.
All in all I'm really pleased we chose this hotel, would definitely visit again and would certainly recommend.",5,2018,04,17
215,Pleasant surprise. ,"This was our first visit to Ireland. Wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. Everything was spotless Paloma at the front desk was awesome. Great food, great location. It is within walking distance to Oscar Wilde‚Äôs house, the National Gallery and a bunch of very good restaurants. ",5,2018,04,13
215,"Beautiful hotel, great staff!","Lovely comfortable, clean and friendly hotel. Not far from the centre but not too close. Great choice for breakfast. The staff were very friendly and helpful, from booking taxis and restaurants to entertaining us in the bar üòÄ",5,2018,04,09
215,Modern Hotel in a great location,"Lovely hotel, fabulous decor some quirky touches (the old fashioned telephone in our room being one). The location is great its  just a few minutes walk  to Trinity College and Grafton street. Staff were friendly and efficient, they changed our room no problem after we realised that the first room was right beside the lift . The room was spacious and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Breakfast had a good selection of food. Overall a very enjoyable stay in the Alex.",5,2018,04,08
215,Very comfortable stay,A short stay here after a long night out!  Fabulously comfortable and spacious room. Breakfast was tasty although the service was a bit haphazard - i had to chase them for breakfast items. I love the art deco feel to the place.,5,2018,04,07
215,Modern & Stylish,Managed to get a reasonably good deal to stay here to watch a rugby European Cup game so it was a perfect location between the centre and the stadium. The hotel has obviously been recently renovated and the interiors are very fresh and modern. Our rooms walls looked like they might have missed the painter as there were quiet a few marks across the room and there was a fair bit of dust - however the decor is nice and the bed/shower are a real highlight. No issues checking in or out and the staff seemed nice. A good location and if the price stays reasonable then a great option for a night/weekend in Dublin.,4,2018,04,07
215,Vjekoslav,"I was vacationing in Ireland and had a horrible toothache. I asked Vjekoslav, at the reception desk if he could find a dentist for me. He called many before he finally found one. He explained where it was and even walked us to the taxi that was waiting out side. Vjekoslav went way out of his way to help me and I truely appreciate all his help. ",5,2018,04,05
215,Fab hotel great location ,"This was our first visit to the Alex and I have to say that we all really enjoyed the stay.

Rooms are very comfortable, the staff are very attentive and the bar and restaurant is very good. It‚Äôs all very cool and a great location for a weekend in central Dublin 

I would highly recommend The Alex

Bunny ",5,2018,04,05
215,Modern and...rare for Dublin....quite stylish,"Dublin hotels tend to come in just three flavors: basic business, quirky small and mediocre midsized meh.

The Alex stands out. It brings clever, savvy design to the drab Dublin hotel scene.

The Alex is stylish...more akin to the quirky and fun hotels you find in London or New York, and nowhere near as pricey. There is attention to detail here. Even the hotel's hallways are sharp, with black paint functioning as wainscoting and cleverly lit room numbers.

Beds are cozy and the seating in the room is comfy. The location is great. Fenian Street is quiet but quite close to fashionable Merion Square Park (be sure to pop in to see the amusing statue of Oscar Wilde.)

Staff are friendly and eager to help. We had issues getting on to the wifi with our cranky travel laptop, but staff quickly came up to the room to help us get online.",5,2018,04,04
215,Nice Hotel,"The room was very nice with a huge comfortable bed and lovely rain forest shower. We had a room on the second floor overlooking the road so not a great view. The booking included breakfast which was limited, the cooked options were pretty poor but the cold options were ok. The hotel is located in a good place for a quieter stay with an easy walk to Graften street and Temple bar.",4,2018,04,04
215,Nice modern hotel but a few issues,"Good points -
The hotel is really nicely designed and modern and feels very new and clean. The beds are huge, very comfortable and the rainfall showers are lovely. The location is quiet, away from all of the bars etc (one pub next door but we were on the first floor and it wasn't loud) but you are only ten minutes walk from Grafton Street and the Temple Bar area. 

Bad points -
Noise inside the hotel was a bit of an issue and meant our stay wasn't very relaxing. One of the lifts was being repaired when we checked in and we could hear loud drilling and hammering in our room. We wanted to relax in the room for a while having been up since 4am but couldn't do so. We called reception and to be fair to the manager he did offer us a complimentary cocktail each to apologise. However the noise carried on from 8.45am the next (Saturday) morning. These things happen but it did ruin the stay somewhat. The cleaners (though friendly and did a great job of cleaning the rooms) were also having loud conversation in the corridor on and off all Sunday morning which was annoying.

The complimentary cocktails were lovely and the bar staff were great. We didn't eat at the hotel as we found the breakfast cost (17 euros per day) quite steep and the reviews of it on Trip Advisor weren't great, so we are out - there are so many coffee shops and restaurants nearby. The bar/restaurant area was also mostly empty during the whole of our 2 night stay.

Overall, a well designed and clean hotel but expensive food and drink prices and they could be more aware of noise. ",3,2018,04,02
215,Fantastic Stay,"A brilliant location, fully refurbished hotel. Lovely room and breakfast was great value with lots of choice. I was really impressed, this hotel exceeded all of my expectations. Stayed in the executive room - FAB",5,2018,03,28
215,(No) Seafood Chowder,"Was visiting for a business lunch. Hotel is well located and very smart following recent refurb. Restaurant was buzzing and had a small but very adequate lunch menu. I ordered a Seafood Chowder and my colleague the chicken salad. The salad was the better choice. 
The ‚ÄúSeafood‚Äù Chowder arrived and was nothing more than watery fishy flavoured hot milk containing celery, carrot and potato. I honestly could not find a single piece of Seafood in the bowl. Even I can make a Seafood Chowder - all you need is Seafood! 
Very disappointed but, in fairness, the waiter took it off the bill when I mentioned the lack of the main ingredient. 
Go for the salad if you‚Äôre there for lunch. (Or order the Chowder if you like celery, carrot and potato soup)
",2,2018,03,27
215,"Modern rooms, amazing shower and huge bed!",The room has modern decor and the bed was huge. The rooms were clean and there were some products there if you forgot yours! The reception staff were friendly and efficient. The location of the hotel is also really close to the city centre. I didn't try any food there so cannot comment but I would stay there again if I went to Dublin and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.,4,2018,03,21
215,Super,"We stayed for three nights during st. Patrick‚Äôs weekend. Very nice hotel, friendly and helpful staff. Perfect location. The breakfast was good but a bit expensive. It‚Äôs not the cheapest hotel, but worth the cost. Would definitely stay again!",5,2018,03,19
215,Amazing stay!,"My husband and I went for St Patrick's Day weekend and had a fabulous time at The Alex! The hotel is decorated in a modern eclectic style which I loved. The staff were friendly, pleasant and patient, even given the extremely busy weekend. We also had some special requests that they catered to with extra special care. Would 100% recommend staying again.",5,2018,03,19
215,Spring Break with kids,"Overall, we had a nice stay while at The Alex.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  However, I would say that the staff was subpar.  We got to the hotel early and sat in the lobby waiting for our room to be ready.  While waiting, we observed how unprofessional the front desk manager Francisco was.  He was curt and rude to the other members of the staff as well as people trying to check in.  
I would also not recommend the breakfast.  The selection was limited and the food was mediocre at best.
The location of this hotel was great.  We enjoyed the nearby pubs.",3,2018,03,18
215,Exceeded Expectations ,"We choose this Hotel at last minute after having cancelled the hotel we booked at Temple Bar on advice from friends.

We are so glad we stayed here as the rooms are a decent size with nice decor and best of all a great bed and shower.

The location is convenient to everything you need.

We did not eat at the Hotel so cannot comment on the dining.",5,2018,03,15
215,One night stay in Dublin with friends,The Alex is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous decor through out. The rooms are finished with the nicest decor I have seen in a long time in any hotel. I only wish we could have stayed another night. I will definitely be back. ,5,2018,03,12
215,The business,Stayed here twice recently since the renovations completed. Both occasions were business trips and the hotel was excellent.The new look and lobby facilities are great and  on the whole it was very comfortable. I expect to be back.,4,2018,03,12
215,Should of spent the money on Staff Training ,"Booked this hotel recently while staying overnight in Dublin for a cake course in maynooth. Chose it mainly due to price ‚Ç¨112 room only and they had secure parking... pics looked nice online. I rang the day before to enquire about the parking, specifically the height restriction as we have a large tall Jeep, the guy at reception was so rude, he literally said ‚ÄúI can see you booked through booking.com, very bad first off‚Äù! I‚Äôm sorry what?!  If there is an issue with treating customers differently who book through booking.com maybe don‚Äôt use the site? he then laughed and said unless the vehicle is over 2.5m there won‚Äôt be an issue ... for anyone thinking of using the car park, when you type it into google maps (Alexander court car park) comes up as a Q park which is a 12min walk away from the hotel! This is NOT the car park... it‚Äôs across the road from the hotel entrance FYI... you must call the hotel to get a access code to enter... On arrival it was very clear the height of the car park was not 2.5! It‚Äôs 1.9m ! We just about managed to get into the tiny space! Very nerve racking being honest... I mentioned this to Conor at reception as i honestly would not of booked the room knowing this. To add insult, we were charged ‚Ç¨36 for parking which was advertised as ‚Ç¨15 by the hotel (we were there from 6:30pm to 6:30am so well within the guidelines of check-in/our times) not surprisingly when we went to print a receipt it didn‚Äôt! Luckily he paid by card So I‚Äôm currently speaking to Daniel a manager at the Davenport Hotel to try get the money back as no one at the Alex answered my calls this morning when all this happened üò† ... from what I can see from reading other reviews now, parking rates seem to be different so do make it clear about parking when u book to avoid hassle. room was lovely. Big bed, nice big tv and shower however it‚Äôs a pity that when the hotel group decided to refurb the building to didn‚Äôt invest some money on its staff training... we literally spent less than 8hours in the room and the lack of customer service and the hassle with parking I‚Äôd rather spend an extra 80e and stay somewhere else ... ",2,2018,03,12
215,The Alex is The one!,"I Stayed here for 3 nights during a storm which prevented any public transport and flights from operating in Dublin, I Can honestly say because of this hotel I decided to write my first review. The staff are extremely helpful and the place is beautiful. It is modern and the food is delicious. I lost my Beats headphones and I came back the next day to find the cleaning staff kept it for me and even fully charged it. The hotel staff genuinely care about your well-being and are very easy to talk to. Highly recommend this hotel. The Alex is the one!",5,2018,03,08
215,A week at The Alex during the 'Beast from the East meeting Storm Emma',"Despite being snowed in, the staff was very helpful, plenty of food and drink.

Also, considering the 12 hour power cut and no wifi for nearly a whole day, they held up pretty well.

Front desk did a great job keeping things smooth!",4,2018,03,05
215,Just loved it,"From check-in to departure the attention to detail and personal touches of the staff stood out. Guilia and Franceso make  this fine perfectly located art deco style hotel so welcoming.
We had a junior suite which was  luxurious and well as cosy, with a Nespresso machine and a wonderful rainforest shower.  An extra bed was put in the living room of the suite for our 13 year old son who found it really comfie. 
Breakfast was delicious a selection of fresh fruits and juices, cereals and full Irish served in a buffet. 
Step outside the front door and within 2 minutes walk is the National Art Gallery of Ireland, Dail Eireann government buildings and the Natural History museum. We stayed just at the tail end of storm Emma and the worst snow in 35 years.  There was no evidence of any storm in the Alex, just calm, cool and collected. We loved it.",5,2018,03,04
215,Beyond all expectations!,"Cannon praise this place highly enough! We've arrived to a lovely upgrade and a birthday plate for my husband's 40th. The hotel is very stylish and sleek following recent renovation. The beds are super comfy. All the staff were beyond helpful and friendly. If you like tasty, innovative cocktails - Dylan at the bar is your man.
The hotel is also in a perfect location, so don't think twice and book this place - you won't be disappointed!",5,2018,03,04
215,"Classy, fun, and right in the middle of everything.","Relaxing with class....that is how we would describe the Alex.  The sister hotel was under construction so they sent us over to their neighbor and we had some wonderful high end bar food and drinks.  The staff was amazing, just classy and perfect.  It was laid back and we were in no hurry....a very comfortable space.  good job Alex!",4,2018,03,03
215,"Really nice hotel, close to Trinity college, large room","Very nice hotel, room was very good and quirky with a retro feel to it, access and cleanliness was good, only criticism was that it was slightly overlooked by the neighbouring office, had to keep curtains closed to not be on display.

Carpark was a short walk away across the street and a bit pricey ‚Ç¨24 overnight but then its a central captial carpark so I guess is to be expected.

Staff really friendly, we didn't eat here so cant comment on the food but looked okay from the outside. 

Would recommend to others, particularly if not traveling by car as its well located.",4,2018,03,03
215,Business Trip Blizzard - thank goodness I was at The Alex!,The newly remodeled Alex hotel is comfortable and well located near Merrion square. The staff works well as a team and makes you comfortable. There is a variety of tasty food on the menu and which I became familiar with over the days I was snowed in. I cannot say enough for the staff who worked extremely hard with excellent manners and warm smiles to keep food and drink for all the customers. Dylan set the example with kindness and humor while keeping a full house satisfied! Room nice and comfortable - I will stay here again!,5,2018,03,02
215,Comfort and convenience ,"I stayed at The Alex for one night in late February. 
The refurb is great - the decor and quality of the beds and linen is high. 
The lobby area is large so I used it as a place to work for an hour or so post check out. 
The location is excellent for exploring the city centre. The price paid (room only) was really reasonable relative to other nearby options. 
The added extras, which I avoided were a bit much, breakfast didn‚Äôt seem like value for money and early or late check out is ‚Ç¨25 an hour! 
Secure parking is available nearby at ‚Ç¨18 which isn‚Äôt bad for a city centre location. 
I will certainly consider The Alex for future stays in Dublin.

",4,2018,02,28
215,Nice decoration and amenities. Service quality inconsistent,"Newly refurbished hotel. Very nice and modern decoration. Large part of the staff friendly and doing their best. A part of staff unsufficiently trained: can‚Äôt answer simple questions eg about room service or refers to someone else.‚Äù Instead of taking responsibility for solving the problem.
Staff is overburdened when their are events in the hotel.
 In the morning there was a fire alarm because someone had forgotten to take his bread from the toaster in the breakfast room. Too bad, it must have brutally woken up dozens of guests.
Breakfast is good and has enough variety. Coffee of varying  quality. Friendly staff. WiFi quality good.
I like the hotel. Has the potential to be perfect, but at this point needs to straighten out differences in service quality.
Prices seem to vary a lot, more than in other European cities. For the price I paid I cannot give more than 3 stars. For lower prices it could have been 4

",3,2018,02,25
215,"Very nice, indeed",We spent three night in this place and i can't complain. You can see that there has been a big renovation. Everything was spotless. Bed was maybe the best where i've ever slept. All he stuff were very nice also. Only little thing that i missed was some more vegetables in the breakfast buffet. Otherwise 5/5.,5,2018,02,20
215,very nice hotel,Really enjoyed this hotel.  It has been done up recently to a decent standard.  The reception area is fine.  The rooms are very nice.  Good quality accommodation - around four star sort of level.  Staff are very pleasant and helpful.  There is a nice reception area and bar as you go in.  Breakfast is fairly ordinary.  The hotel is decently located less than 10 minutes to St Stephen's Green.  Would definitely stay there again,4,2018,02,19
215,Lovely Hotel ,"We stayed here in 25/11/2017. The hotel has had a complete make over. The decor is lovely, the rooms are also well appointed and comfortable. 
We had bed and breakfast. We attended a concert that night and came back to the hotel after for a few drinks. The bar staff were shocking, very slow with service. My drink of choice is vodka and cranberry, every bottle of this mixer that was on the shelf was months out of date. I find this totally unacceptable and brought it to the attention of staff at checkout. They really didn‚Äôt seem too bothered about this. 
Breakfast the next morning was ok but again the service was far from good. 
While the hotel itself is nice some of the staff definitely need more training in service and bar management. ",3,2018,02,10
215,Nicely finished room,"This hotel was recently updated. The rooms are nicely furnished and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also nice and the shower had plenty of hot water. A great location, so much within a short walking distance.",4,2018,02,04
215,more pros than cons,"stayed for one night on business and overall very good
On the positive; good size room with fresh ( recently refurbished?) fittings. 
negatives; no bath and light fitting broken. Also limited selection for breakfast
however main positive is the containers for shampoo and bath wash. These are in pouches rather than the usual plastic containers. Apparently these use significantly less energy in production, which is to be commended!",4,2018,01,29
215,Excellent Rooms,"The Hotel is recently refurbished and is bang up to date with decor. The rooms are really nice, the bed is huge and the room is spacious. The TV has Chromecast and there is a digital radio in the room. The door is solid and blocks out sound well but they do make an awfully loud bang when they close.

The reason for only four stars was the breakfast. Despite having a breakfast menu on the website there was only a buffet. This is fine except they had ran out of bacon, eggs and sausages. There was also no hash browns, which is poor form I think. We ended leaving to go to a nearby cafe after waiting 10mins with no service at all.

On the plus side, it's slightly away from Temple Bar making the street a bit quieter but is only a 15min walk into the centre of town. There's a nice pub just next door as well.",4,2018,01,29
215,Great hotel,Couldnt complain about this hotel im hoping i spelt this correctly but Jasko the night manager couldnt help us enough.  No problem reccomending.  Great room rooms very clean and tidy tasty breakfast even a checkout time of 12 which is 11 in a lot of other places.,5,2018,01,28
215,Christmas night out,"This is the former Alexander hotel so if you are looking for other reviews check that out.

The Alex is a fine hotel, the reception staff were friendly and helpful and the room was a good size, comfortable bed, warm with good bathroom facilities.

The bar (which is the breakfast area) is bright and trendy ... fine for a breakfast area but a bit bright and impersonal for a hotel bar to be honest. All the staff we encountered were pleasant and attentive however some training in basic service would be required - I am giving the benefit of the doubt here as it was a busy Christmas party night. Barmen who could pull a proper pint would have been an advantage !

In saying that it is a nice place, centrally located so that the city is within an easy walk. The food for our function was excellent and the breakfast options were good too. I shared a room with a colleague which cost us ‚Ç¨199 which was around the going rate for the time of year. We left the following morning feeling content with what we had and hopefully will be back if the opportunity presented itself.",4,2018,01,24
215,Good hotel in great location,"The hotel is in a fantastic spot. Check in was quick and friendly and the rooms are comfortable ans spacious with what looks like a new refurb in the bathrooms. The bar and breakfast were great, the only minor complaint wiuld be the very limited menu in the bar/restaurant but you're surrounded by amazing places to eat so that's not really a problem.",5,2018,01,17
215,"Good for Business, Bit Slow","Visited today for a business meeting. Beautiful hotel, very clean and tidy. Looks newly refurbished. Have a cafe off the main restaurant. Ordered some teas/coffee, were slow to come but the staff were friendly. Lots of business people during the day. ",4,2018,01,11
215,EXCELLENT STAY AND TREATMENT.,"Very good quality hotel, cozy room, very well equipped and a fairly large and comfortable bed, there was a problem with the coffee maker but from reception we were solved immediately.

very good breakfast and the restaurant is also recommended
For us, the beds were not ideal because there was only one continuous mattress and a huge down duvet - but the bed was huge",5,2024,06,14
215,Nice hotel,"I came for two days for work and the hotel has been one of the best parts. Super clean, spacious and comfortable room and located very close to the center and my offices. Without a doubt, to repeat. The staff has been excellent at all times, always with a smile and ready to help.",5,2024,05,30
215,Good for visiting Dublin. With some details to improve,"The hotel is very well located to get to know the city. The staff is friendly. Details are missing in the rooms such as leaving bathrobes for those who occupy the room, replenishing water or amenities. In our room there was no place to hang the towels, we told us about it and they never fixed it.
Our reservation was with booking and without notice they withheld the price of the room and 200 euros for unforeseen events on our card. These types of actions must be reported",3,2023,08,11

215,Un bel soggiorno a Dublino all'Hotel Alex.,"L‚Äôhotel √® accogliente, non solo per la struttura che √® pulita, comoda e spaziosa, ma soprattutto grazie all‚Äôapporto e al supporto del personale, che fa sempre in modo di farti sentire a casa, sono tutti molto cordiali, e lavorano al meglio con attenzione ai particolari.

Ho lavorato per un congresso medico a Dublino durante l‚Äôultima settimana di gennaio, l‚Äôhotel si presta molto bene al turismo congressuale, le sale sono comode e ben fornite. Buoni gli spazi per i coffee break e la pausa pranzo, si mangia bene, men√π variato e soprattutto piatti ben presentati. 
Che fortuna essere seguiti da DOMINIQUE e il suo staff, questo ragazzo √® un TRENO!! Svelto, preciso, attento e soprattutto Orgoglioso di quello che fa, mette passione in tutto anche quando deve riprendere qualcuno perch√© sono stati fatti degli errori e quel qualcuno sta l√¨, si prende la tirata di orecchie ma poi va via soddisfatto perch√© sa che da lui sta imparando!! Effettivamente non posso dire che sia stato tutto perfetto, ma posso sicuramente riconoscere che quelle piccole ‚Äúimperfezioni‚Äù, sono dovute al fatto che l‚Äôhotel con la nuova gestione ha aperto da poco e lo staff molto giovane, √® alle prime armi, stanno formando tutti e lo stanno facendo alla grande. D'altronde mi chiedo chi di noi non √® mai stato principiante? 

Infine vorrei ricordare la competenza di chi ci ha accolto e seguito alla reception: Francesco √® un manager di grande livello e la sua squadra tutta, sta crescendo bene; la freschezza di Paloma, la disponibilit√† dei colleghi e la precisione di Giulia una ‚Äúpiccola‚Äù ragazza dalle grandissime risorse, danno un valore aggiunto al lavoro di accoglienza. 

La posizione dell‚Äôhotel √® davvero ottima, vicina al Trinity College (che non dovete mancare di visitare), a un passo dal parco che ospita la statua di Oscar Wilde, e piuttosto vicino a Grafton Street, allo stesso tempo rimane un pochino decentrata e quindi fuori dal traffico intenso delle aree pi√π centrali, pur rimanendo ben servita. La zona √® davvero piacevole.",5,2018,02,27
215,"Despues de la renovacion, perfecto y muy recomendable hotel en Dublin","Aunque ya hab√≠amos le√≠do que el hotel hab√≠a renovado las habitaciones y en general todo el edificio, fue una sorpresa muy agradable el nivel de detalle y confort que se ha conseguido.
Habitaci√≥n muy amplia, decorada con mucho gusto y total confort para el hu√©sped.
A 13¬¥ del centro de Dublin hotel perfecto y totalmente recomendable.
Personal de recepci√≥n muy agradable, se ofrec√≠an para todo tipo de ayuda sobre rutas, transportes, etc, etc.
Del restaurante no podemos opinar ya que no hicimos uso del mismo (eran pocos dias y los quisimos aprovechar por completo)",5,2018,01,04
