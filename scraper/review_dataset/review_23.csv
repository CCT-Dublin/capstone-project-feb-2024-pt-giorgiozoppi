23,A highlight in the city,"Nice and cosy Boutiquehotel, located perfectly in the  City center. Very friendly and competent staff, with attention to detail. Nice breakfast. Wonderful views from the rooftop bar. And for foodies, the Caelis restaurant is also wonderful. It’s nice to dine in a Michelin starred restaurant, and then simply afterwards take the elevator to your room. 
Of course, we will stay there again in the future.",5,2024,10,17
23,Hotel Ohla Barcelona-a great place to stay in a fantastic city.,"I was impressed with Hotel Ohla and it certainly deserved its rating. It was perfectly placed with easy access to all the key sites to visit.  Its rooms were functional and tidy and breakfast was a delight.  What really made the hotel was the friendliness and willingness to help by the desk and concierge staff in particular.  No request was too hard for them to address, willingly and professionally.  I would particularly like to thank Rafael at the concierge desk for his help throughout our wonderful stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,10,17

The moment I stepped in the service has been impeccable and hotel was very clean, fresh and beautiful, the breakfast was really good too. I would also state that the staff at the front door are always vigilant to track who enter the hotel and that is a great way I felt ensured safe overall. The hotel has class and elegance and it was worth staying at Ohla Barcelona which is also located at the perfect spot in the city of Barcelona.

Hand written notes, cava for our anniversary, the turndown service, I could go on and on. Their rooftop bar and breakfast is a must! The concierge and experience team are extremely helpful with good local recommendations for places to go eat, hang out and explore, and i would not miss out on their sauna!!

23,Exceptional Service and Attention to Detail,"I recently stayed at the Ohla Barcelona Hotel during a last-minute trip in Sep, and despite booking just a week before, I was lucky to secure a room during a very busy time in the city due to the La Mercè 2024 festival. I had to split my 8-day stay into three separate bookings because of availability, but Iraia and the experience team went above and beyond to accommodate us, reducing the need to switch rooms from three times to just twice, which I truly appreciated.

One evening, after getting caught in the rain, we returned to the hotel to change before heading to dinner. The room had already been cleaned, I accidentally dirtied the bedsheet. To my surprise and delight, when we returned from dinner, the bed sheets had been freshly changed and the housekeeping team had prepared the room for the evening, and making the bed. . The level of meticulous care and attention from the housekeeping staff was truly impressive.

The entire staff at Ohla Barcelona were welcoming, friendly, and highly professional,  the breakfast is good contributing to both our positive impression of the hotel and the city. The location is also excellent, with easy access to everything Barcelona has to offer.

Though it is a bit on the pricey side, we were 100% happy with our stay and are very grateful for the exceptional service. Thank you, Iraia, and the entire team for making our time in Barcelona so memorable!",5,2024,09,23
23,Fantastic,"4 nights away with family. The staff, food, service and standard of the Hotel was excellent. Great location too

23,Perfection in the heart of Gothic quarter,"Five star service and well appointed and comfortable hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Fabulous breakfast, free bottled water daily in room and welcome drinks at reception after a hard day of exploring.
Outstanding rooftop with fabulous setting and view and pool.
We look forward to our return.",5,2024,09,14
23,"If you have any reservation about booking, just BOOK YOUR RESERVATION!","If I could rate this hotel 6/5 stars I would. Everything in this hotel is top notch. Picture this: your first time in Spain, dropped off on the side of the street in a beautiful street - looking around to identify which of this beautiful buildings is Ohla hotel when a warm face greets you. “Are you guests of the Ohla?” ..why, yes we were. You’re tired and your bags are taken from you. Walked in and someone else is checking in, no problem we will just wait. “Shall we offer you a glass of cava while you wait and a chocolate?” The chocolate was DIVINE. Our room was not ready, we were early but why not enjoy more complimentary cava on us at the rooftop bar? 
If I continue like this, I’ll end up writing a short story but the staff at this hotel are TOP freaking notch there is no other way to put it. I was so so sad to leave. The experience actually started a week before, when I was contacting them to arrange a surprise for my husband’s birthday and I was able to get a cake and balloons and a complimentary bottle of cava. They are so sweet, I wish I booked my entire Barcelona trip here. I will recommend this hotel to everyone I ever know coming to Barcelona. Always.",5,2024,09,12
23,Fabulous Ohla Barcelona Stay...,"Our 3 Night Pre-Cruise was fabulous at Ohla Barcelona Hotel. My husband and I traveled with my sister & husband, and from the moment we arrived at the hotel, the customer service was outstanding. We were greeted at our vehicle and assisted with our baggage immediately on arrival.  The welcoming team at the reception area were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and our welcome included wine on arrival, while they checked us in. The service throughout the entire stay was excellent and the atmosphere was exceptional. 
Our junior suites were spacious, stylish, had stunning views and top-notch amenities were provided.  The rooftop is beautiful and they provided a free champagne glass to each guest. The hotel also provided a free breakfast, which was amazing!.  The location is excellent, very near and walking distance to shopping and local restaurants. 
The entire staff's services are outstanding and everyone was very attentive to our needs.  One night, we were in search of a coffee shop at 3am. Since there was no nearby venue opened at that time, the reception area staff provided a warm and welcoming area for us to sit and even served us the coffee we wanted, along with accompanying us in pleasant conversation! We were there until 5am. :)
It is evident that Ohla Barcelona's entire hotel staff is dedicated to excellent service. We are extremely pleased to have stayed here and would return in a heartbeat. Thank you for the unforgettable experience in Barcelona.",5,2024,09,12
23,STAY HERE!,"I felt so compelled to write this review as we have just finished a 6 week trip through Europe and this hotel had by far, the BEST service out of everywhere we stayed. 

Every staff member we interacted with was friendly, helpful and kind but in particular, Kiarash at reception. We were so tired and drained from our flight and we were greeted very warmly by the welcoming Kiarash, who instantly uplifted our spirits with his demeanor and a room upgrade!

The hotel rooms were beautiful, clean and comfortble and the views from the rooftop pool and bar is spectacular. Highly recommend you pick this hotel as it is so well located, you can walk everywhere.",5,2024,09,09
23,amazing,"The hotel is amazing, rooms are modern spacious and clean, the staff is terrific they recommended a great restaurant and made the reservation for us.
The roof top pool and lounge is amazing as well with views of the city.
I would recommend including the breakfast as it is worth it.",5,2024,09,05
23,A celebration of celebrations!,"First impressions always count - so the 5 Star knockout welcome as we walked through the doors of the Ohla Barcelona was text book perfection! A greeting glass of chilled Cava, poured during charming conversation with Javi and Kiarash was delightful. So imagine the surprise and delight when we were upgraded to a junior suite!!! A bottle of bubbles on ice - and a beautiful hand written birthday card and balloon ( thank you Sayuri San) for my girlfriend Emma!! Wow! And just to make sure, she would never forget our stay - there was an invitation for complimentary drinks on the hotel’s stunning rooftop with incredible views of Barcelona!!! That ladies and gentlemen of the hotel industry is how you do it. Room upgrades are quite rightly based on availability - but the over and above way the team went to make Emma feel super special was magical. BTW, we ate in the hotel’s Michelin star restaurant which was an equally beautiful experience m. Bravo Ohla Barcelona, bravo! Peter",5,2024,09,03
23,OHLA YES!,"What a fabulous location for travelers!  The OHLA really is in a good spot and is so comfortable to stay at that it ticked all my boxes!
With an easy walk to restaurants, landmarks and shops it made getting about easy. Only took one taxi  to see the Sagrada Familia!  Now THAT you must go and see. Then a Taxi to the port to embark on a cruise ship. The rest of the time it was walk, walk, walk...

The room was well set out and the bed very comfortable. I will be honest I didn't  eat in the hotel restaurant except for the included breakfast, as it seemed a little pricey especially considering the availability of restaurants just a short walk away.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The chocolates and cool drink on check-in was a nice touch. 
Definitely worth considering if you are going to Barcelona!",5,2024,09,02
23,Beautiful Barcelona at Ohla,"Sensational stay at Ohla Barcelona, had a very quiet large suite on the 5 th floor over looking the Main Street,  bathroom was huge and very clean. Bed super comfy with all lush amenities. 
Hotel was close to everything, so walking was easy to get everywhere . 
Staff attentive and very helpful with  directions, taxis etc. 
a lovely   breakfast buffet was downstairs in the restaurant La plassohla, we had dinner on our first night  which was divine. 
Rooftop pool was great with a bar and food. Not to much shade unfortunately and people were  getting annoyed with lack of it, we managed to snag one of the cabanas and soon  offered to share with a couple who were from Norway and not coping with the sun. 
Possible the only negative really. 
So many great shops and  restaurants close by, can’t wait to go back as it was a highlight of our trip through Europe. 
Book,  you won’t be disappointed",5,2024,08,31
23,Fantastic Stay at Ohla Barcelona !,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Ohla Barcelona! The design room was ideal for our short visit, featuring a super comfortable bed, a spacious bathroom, and a separate WC—everything we needed for a relaxing stay. We also greatly appreciated the thoughtful attention from the cleaning team each day.

The Reception and Concierge staff were exceptionally welcoming and always eager to help, making us feel right at home. We spent a lot of time enjoying the rooftop, and while we loved the space, adding sunbeds would make it even more enjoyable. We also found the rooftop team to be very friendly, though having service come directly to us instead of going to the bar would enhance the experience even further.

A small suggestion: a bit more variety in the breakfast offerings would make it even better.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our trip and are already looking forward to returning for another city break!",5,2024,08,20
23,Absolutely heaven !!,Absolutely the best stay ever! From the minute you walk in the door everything is wonderful!! The staff makes checking in a breeze and you are treated like royalty!!

Modern hotel with lovely design details,5,2024,08,18
23,Barcelona best,"Excellent staff added to a very comfortable stay
As. Good as any staff anywhere in the world 
Hotel modern boutique with first class facilities and good roof bar and pool 
Excellent location near the Rambla but with enough streets imbetween !",5,2024,08,16
23,"Fantastic hotel - good pool, gym, room, location, plus they found my lost passport ;-)","We stayed at Hotel Ohla last September, and had a great time.   Check-in went smoothly, and our room was clean and modern.   The gym is decent for a hotel of this size, and they even offered guided runs through the city!

Every morning we had breakfast downstairs, which was a typical European buffet, then went exploring.    The location is right at the edge of the Gothic district, close to some main metro stops, and about a mile from the beach (you have to go through/around port area).    Really happy with location.

We ate on the roofdeck several times, decent food/prices, and the small pool was warmed by the glass siding, but still refreshing.   At night it turns into a club, and there is a line downstairs, but the rooms are soundproof so we were never bothered by any noise, and guests were able to go past to use elevators.

After checking out, they let us stay at the roofdeck for the afternoon, and we left on the train for Stiges, only to find when we arrived that I had lost my passport!    Called Ohla, they searched, couldn't find it immediately, but they called back hours later to say they had found it.   Really saved my skin (US Consulate was closed for weekend, then for a holiday, so I would miss my flight home).

Thanks for the great stay, and for the extra effort searching for my passport.",5,2024,08,15
23,THE hotel in Barcelona,"The most wonderful staff that will go out of their way to make your stay memorable, beautiful design and lovely rooms, a Michelin star restaurant in the house that serves mind blowing food and a super trendy rooftop bar and pool….Ohla is THE place to stay in Barcelona",5,2024,08,13
23,Greatest hotel experience ever!!!,"I decided to pop the big question to my girlfriend while in Barcelona and Ohla went above and beyond to help me make it extra special. The didn’t give away any hints upon checking in and waited till we left to the proposal sight to change our room into a romantic setting through the “falling in love” package. The hotel is top notch and the views from the roof are breath taking. If you’re looking for relaxation and feeling like your royalty this is the place to stay. The room was beautiful and the cleanest I’ve ever been in. Next time we return to Barcelona we won’t stay anywhere else as this hotel has it all and is located in the heart of the city, you won’t be disappointed!!",5,2024,08,11
23,Design hotel in the perfect spot,"A very stylish mid-size hotel in a brilliant location.
Lovely design touches, staff are great and while the rooms are on the small side, they are cleverly designed.
Rooftop pool and bar a welcome relief from the summer crowds.
Recommend staying here.",4,2024,08,11
23,A 10/10 experience! If you want a cozy stay and a great location - this is your place.,"The hotel has very hospitable and professional staff!   
Kiarash Arif, one of the gentlemen who works at the hotel, regularly answered all of our questions and shared his vast understanding and knowledge about Barcelona and Spain with us, which helped create a memorable stay.
We will definitely visit again!",5,2024,08,08
23,Experience to remember,"From the moment we checked in, the staff at Ohla made this a memorable experience. A bottle of champagne welcomed us in our room (which was spectacular) and we received handwritten notes and special treats daily. Everyone was friendly and helpful and you couldn’t ask for a better location. And our dinner the last night at Caelis…chef’s kiss! We would return to this hotel anytime we visit Barcelona and highly recommend to all!",5,2024,08,03
23,Barcelona Stay,"Great staff, they could not do enough for you to make your time in Barcelona most enjoyable! Awesome churros and chocolate right down the street. Day trip  trip rec of concierge 40 minute train ride to a beautiful  beach town called  Sitges Hotel was lovely and roof top bar with great views. Overall a great place to stay in Barcelona!!",5,2024,07,30
23,"Be Careful, You may get personal injury in this Hotel","We stayed in a VIP Access hotel and on the first day my wife's hair was sucked into their hair dryer so we had to cut her hair in half so it could be released. Management saw the scenario and admitted it was a faulty dryer and they replaced it and provided us with a bottle of wine which they took the day after.  I'll share the pictures from all the hair on social media so people can be warned about the personal injury you can receive in this place
​",1,2024,07,30
23,A little kindness goes a long way!,"The staff were friendly and went out of their way to make me feel that I was a valued visitor. I valued this as this visit was the first visit I have done by myself since my husband died. The free glasses of wine were much appreciated and staff members knowing who I was.
The hotel is well positioned for being able to walk to many of the key sites and the metro is close by.
The rooms were very comfortable and everywhere was kept spotlessly clean. I ate in the restaurant every night and the food was delicious and beautifully presented. There was an excellent choice at breakfast and in the current heat the fact that the water in the room was free and in plentiful supply was very welcome. When I come back to Barcelona I fully intend to stay at the hotel again.",5,2024,07,29
23,simply stunning,"Wow wow wow this hotel is pure luxury aesthetically it’s simply stunning and spotless with an amazing roof top pool and bar area with a great view, but what stood out for me was the staff and how they go above and beyond to make your stay unforgettable, they treat you like royalty and cannot do enough for you, 
The little extra touches also go along way and made our stay extra special, 
When you check in you are not feared a glass of cava, chocolates or refreshing water.
my now fiance proposed in our room but emailed the hotel before hand about his plans (unbeknown to me) to help create the special moment and decorate the room with balloons,rose petals,chocolates,flowers,champagne and other extras, 
The next day we were also left a lovely post card of congratulations and more chocolates and vip access for the roof top bar with 2 glasses of champagne included.
What also stood out for me was each evening housekeeping came round and offered fresh towels and even more chocolates, 
I cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay so memorable. What a credit to the hotel they are.",5,2024,07,26
23,Great place and fantastic people that gave us a stay to remember with a smile.,"We had the most wonderful experience, from the reception met by friendly service minded people (funny too), to a wonderful room, great breakfast, lunch and dinner (Caelis), everything surrounded in a great ambience and design.

The food was extraordinary starting with buffet breakfast, appetizers on rooftop and amazing restaurant for dinner. 

We 100% will recommend and look forward to coming back !",5,2024,07,23
23,Two Thumbs Up!,"we are 2 couples on a fun trip to Barcelona together and we picked Hotel Ohla based upon reviews and amenities.  
First i will say that the service in this hotel was Fantastic.  Everyone is familiar with their jobs and eager to please.  We have had such a wonderful experience here.
Secondly the location is perfect.  We can walk all over the gothic quarter and down to the beach with no trouble.  We did a walking tapas tour in the Born neighborhood that was awesome, we walked past all the old Roman ruins, the gothic cathedrals and all the little shops.  Super fun. 
One SUPER nice perk at the Ohla is the breakfast.  It is easily a $25 breakfast per person and is so convenient. And the mixed vegi ratatouille was my favorite thing to eat each day.    
All in all this was a big two thumbs up, would recommend.",5,2024,07,23
23,Loved this hotel,"Couldn’t have enjoyed our stay more.  Fantastic and attentive staff, clean and fashionable room, along with a central location great for sightseeing, and topped off with a rooftop pool with a fantastic view.      Perfect place to finish off a Mediterranean cruise.",5,2024,07,21
23,Muy Excelentes Vacaciones,"Ohla Barcelona is a true gem! Impeccable service and luxurious ambiance create an unforgettable experience. The rooftop bar boasts breathtaking views, the serene pool offers relaxation, and breakfast is a delightful start to the day. Leaving was genuinely difficult after such an exceptional stay. It is must stay location in Barcelona.",5,2024,07,17
23,"Good location, great service and roof top bar with great views.","Hotel Ohla is nicely located in the older part of Barcelona and a few blocks away from the Ramblas, with lots of walkable shopping, cafes, etc close by. The hotel is in an older building that has been completely renovated with a very modern look. The restaurant on the main floor and the rooftop bar and pool are both excellent. There is also a Michelin rated restaurant inside - very busy, so never got to try it. 

The rooms are very modern - glass enclosed showers right in the middle of the rooms (the ‘designer’ rooms anyway) and the beds are very comfortable. 

Service was absolutely top notch, from the doorman to the front desk to the wait staff. 

Views from the rooftop bar really add to the value of this stay.",5,2024,07,16
23,Great hotel,Great hotel and top staff in the heart of Barcelona. Beautiful Rooftop bar and pool. A private and secure parking available at the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff for al question and needs. We enjoyed our stay and would choose OHLA Barcelona again for a next stay.,5,2024,07,16
23,5 Star Hotel,"Highly attentive staff, lovely rooms, beautiful rooftop pool and excellent restaurant. Our favorite hotel, always on point. Situated at the intersection of el Born and the Gothic Quarter, Ohla Hotel is the right location to enjoy walking Barcelona.",5,2024,07,15
23,Can't recommend it enough,The nicest hotel service we have ever had on a gorgeous property! The hotel staff treats you like royalty from the moment you walk in. You don't want for anything because of the amenities and attention to detail. Had a great time dining at their tapas restaurant and lounging by the lovely rooftop pool. Treat yourself to a stay at Hotel Ohla if you're ever in Barcelona!,5,2024,07,11
23,5 Star 🌟,"The staff were fantastic especially head of reception and concierge team. We were welcomed with open arms from arrival to department everything was thought of. 
Definitely will be the only hotel I will stay in Barcelona. 
Gorgeous roof top bar with fantastic views. 
Ideally centrally located quiet rooms and comfortable beds.",5,2024,07,10

If ever in Barcelona, treat yourself and stay at Hotel Ohla!",5,2024,07,10
23,A very nice gothic quarter hotel with a great rooftop pool and bar,"This is a very nice hotel located in the  beautiful Gothic Quarter. We got upgraded from a design room to a junior suite, which was spacious with a beautiful view. Bed was very comfortable. The decor was a bit dated but the room was very nice . The rooftop pool bar has a really incredible view of the city. The included buffet breakfast was very nice and the staff are very helpful and friendly",4,2024,07,09
23,Great food Great location with little hiccup,"My stay at Ohla was memorable. Welcomed with chocolates and champagne, the hotel’s central yet quiet location was a bonus.

The rooftop bar and pool were highlights. The bar offered stunning city views and a wide cocktail range. The pool, surrounded by European architecture, provided a unique swimming experience under the open sky.

The breakfast was superb, with a variety of fresh and high-quality foods. The attentive staff and elegant setting added to the experience.

However, an incident with a service maid entering our suite unexpectedly during an evening bath service was disappointing. The front desk’s response, blaming us for not using the “do not disturb” sign or citing a language barrier, was unsatisfactory for a high-standard establishment like Ohla.

Improvements could include advance notice of services and ensuring staff do not enter occupied rooms without vibal permission or as least wait for guest to open the door.

Would we return? Definitely maybe!",4,2024,07,08
23,Exception boutique hotel in Barcelona,"This boutique hotel minutes walking to the large shopping streets, the cathedral and great restaurants in Barcelona was one of the best we’ve ever stayed in. 
Exceptional staff, rooftop pool, with bar, food and great views of Barcelona was unique. One star Michelin Restaurant a destination. 
Rooms were lovely and appeared recently renovated. 
A real find!!!!",5,2024,07,07
23,Would definitely stay here again!!!!,"The staff at this hotel are wonderful. Everybody made us feel very welcome. They upgraded our room, which was lovely and the hotel itself is great. 
The breakfast also was wonderful. All the staff again was amazing 
The reason I didn’t give it a five out of five was because our room I thought needed  a little more TLC, for example -the rug had bad stains on it.",4,2024,07,06
23,No bueno,"Unfortunately, My wife and I had a very unpleasant stay to say the least and was quite disappointed of the hotel and its services for a 5 star hotel rating which should be more like 3.5 stars.  Don’t expect it to be like the Ritz or Four Seasons. Our first night after a 15 hour flight and feeling jet lagged, we couldn’t even get a good night’s rest due the very loud noises that can be heard in the middle of the night with people talking in the courtyard/rooftop and trash bins being emptied all over the city and church bells going off every hour.  The next morning upon waking up to open up the curtains, I noticed the window was left cracked open which of course the reason for the noise to be possibly 10 times worse.   The second night wasn’t nearly as bad now with the window shut completely of course but can still be heard but didn’t bother us.  We addressed this with the front desk twice with 2 different persons and to inform management of the issue but felt they didn’t care any less other than just saying their apologies despite the unsatisfactory room condition with the excessive noise disturbance due to their own fault of leaving the window cracked open.  Regardless, we tried to make the best of our stay given we didn’t want to ruin our vacation.  We also opted for the breakfast as well as we which we thought was very underwhelming especially when they advertise on their website as their so called Michelin star head chef heads all their dining establishments.  The breakfast was just any ordinary self-serve buffet type breakfast as you would get at any other hotel chain like the Marriott or Hilton with the basics like scrambled eggs, sausage, breads.  The assortment of pastries wasn’t great either especially here in Barcelona.  It’s DIY coffee with the espresso machine and no omelette station.  Service was nonexistent given its self serve and didn’t clear any of our empty plates off the table until when we’re nearly done.  Same thing with the other tables as well.  They just let the patrons stack their empty plates to the side of the table.  Anyhow, maybe we were expecting much given the other reviews and 5 star hotel rating.  We will not ever return.",1,2024,07,06
23,Great place to stay in Barcelona!,This boutique hotel was in a great place to visit all the top spots - between the gothic area and the exiample area. The staff were so helpful and friendly.

23,Wonderful,"What a wonderful hotel. All the staff from reception, baggage, restaurant & bar were exceptional. Friendly helpful just fabulous. The hotel location is perfect to explore the city. Fabulous bar with views on the top terrace great after a long day sightseeing. Room clean and comfortable but more importantly very quiet. We booked a city break with British Airways under the Mr & Mrs Smith site so the room was checked in the evening, towels replaced water replenished and a chocolate each on the pillow, and bottle of cava delivered on the first afternoon. Will stay here again the staff made our short first visit to Barcelona a memorable one.",5,2024,06,30

23,Amazing,We are just back from a stay at ohla Barcelona and all I can say is amazing. Outstanding  customer service from all staff we were there for my partners 30th and I had requested for balloons on arrival nothing was a bother. Breakfast was lovely and there was variety. The hotel is spotlessly clean the cleanest hotel I have stayed in. The rooftop bar has a lovely atmosphere although a bit pricey was really lovely. The hotel is in a great location. Can’t fault a thing would definitely return.,5,2024,06,17

I don’t know how to start!
Everything was amazing about Ohla Barcelona! 🙂‍↔️🤍 Location, staff, hotel’s roof and restaurant and ofc staff who’s working there.

Oh God what a city…. 🙌🏼🇪🇸💛
Muchas grasias!",5,2024,06,17
23,Great hotel,"Amazing hotel, situated close enough to all the main city attractions but tucked away from the hustle and bustle. The staff are amazing, could do more to help you, great recommendations from the concierge for places to eat, visit etc. the roof top bar is brilliant, so good that non guest queue to go there in the evenings, but don’t worry if you’re staying you get straight in. This truly is a great boutique hotel and we will be back soon.",5,2024,06,16
23,Beautiful boutique in Barcelona with exceptional staff,"Location 5/5
Cleanliness 5/5
Amenities 4/5
Staff 5/5

Pros
- Exceptional staff who work hard to personalise your stay. Without even saying our own names, the concierge knew who we were and that we were travelling for our honeymoon. Welcome drinks at reception are a beautiful touch also. We cannot fault the service of the checkin and porters who organised taxis, walked our bags to the room and were overall flawless. 
- Gorgeous views of the city from the rooftop bar. This appears to be popular with non-hotel-residents as there’s often a queue outside. Hotel guests do not have to queue and are given preference. Our room also had a stunning view of the street from the floor length window. 
- Housekeeping was so quick and thorough! Sometimes finished the room whilst we were downstairs eating breakfast. Great selection at breakfast with complementary omelette station and optional upsells including eggs benedict and daily specials. We didn’t try any other restaurants in the hotel but are aware that there is a Michelin star restaurant onsite. 
- Short walk to many attractions and restaurants. 

Cons 
- The only thing that could be improved at this hotel would be the gym as the sides of the treadmill fell off at the beginning of the workout and the bikes/cross trainer didnt work. If someone else is using the bench, there is limited area for others to use the weights or mat on the floor. The room was also split into what I assume is a spa area as there was a sauna, two sunbeds under a skylight, and a hair wash basin which was quite random. Personally, I think it would’ve been better to remove these things and make the gym better. If you’re not here to use the gym though, the hotel is perfect in every other way. 
- If I were to be extremely picky, it would be great to have some sunbeds by the pool area instead of the pods/couches as it was hard to put your feet up and tan (but also, its a rooftop pool bar so guests can pick their battles and have a bevvie instead or walk to the beach)",4,2024,06,14
23,You have to stay here !!!!!!,"Just amazing from start to finish !! Greeted with a glass or two of Cava and beautiful truffle chocolate. We got there early so our room wasn't quite ready so we were given VIP ticket for a glass of Cava on the rooftop bar. Staff couldn't do enough for you. We were spoilt from the minute we got there until we left. So clean, the junior suite which we had booked was beautiful. Bottle of Cava on ice waiting for us 😃. Highly highly recommended !! The nicest hotel we have ever stayed in !!!! Great selection of the buffet breakfast and you can ask for fried egg or omelette to go with the bacon and sausages !! We will definitely stay here again ❤️",5,2024,06,12
23,Not a true 5 star experience,I wanted to love this hotel but it didn’t quite live up to the hype. The rooms are a strange design - particularly the shower which was not functional and tended to flood the rest of the bathroom. The noise from the street was also too loud to allow for a restful sleep. Breakfast is subpar for a 5 star property. Positives were location and staff and decor of the hotel. This is a popular spot for the rooftop views - which are gorgeous  but it was always packed with outside guests which was a pain if you just wanted to enjoy and relax. We actually checked out early and went to El Palace - much more inline with the 5 star experience we were expecting.,3,2024,06,11
23,Luxurious,we will reccomend this to everyone! a wonderful stay and thanks to the extremly professional and highly serviceminded staff they made us feel like King and Queen! location is just perfect and in no time you enter La rambla by foot. Beautiful surroundings!,5,2024,06,09
23,Exzellent Hotel with extraordinary roof top.,Very nice Hotel in the middle of the City. Warm reception and top service all the time. The roof top is extraordinary and a must to visite. Pool and Bar at the roof top. Very clean and nice rooms. Breakfast is very good as well. In a few minutes you can walk to the cathedral of Barcelona or to the Rambla.,5,2024,06,09
23,Great stay and a great location,"What a lovely stay at the Ohla Barcelona.  From our first welcome to our final goodbye, the entire staff goes over and beyond to ensure a great stay.  Each morning we started our day with a delightful breakfast, and enjoyed the rooftop pool and Terrace upon our return in the  late afternoons.  Dinner in the restaurant was delicious.  Concierges always helpful.  The location of this hotel cannot be beat. We look forward to staying here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2024,06,07
23,Great stay at Ohla,"We had an excellent stay at Ohla Barcelona. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, our room was nicely appointed and spotlessly clean. The breakfast offering was very good and the pool/bar on the roof was superb.

The hotel is well positioned to get around the city easily.",5,2024,06,06
23,We couldn't have asked for more!  5 Stars all the way!,"What an amazing Hotel - what an amazing team - what an incredible location - what a comfy bed - a 5 star stay! 

To say we had a fabulous stay is an understatement!  Our room was amazing - we upgraded to a Junior and it was wonderful!  The welcome we got from the team each time we arrived back at the hotel made sure we not only felt valued but that they were not only invested in making sure our stay was incredible but also that we had the best time possible in Barcelona.

Location wise - with the exception of Park Guell - we walked to all the sights!  Loved how close it was to everything!  

The views from the Rooftop bar were breathtaking and an absolute haven at the end of the day! 

Their restaurant recommendations were top notch!

To stay our stay well and truly exceeded our expectations is an understatement!  We would return in a heartbeat.",5,2024,06,05
23,"Such a clean vibrant friendly place. Fairly busy as you would expect.  Early June, weather perfecto.","Great hotel. Good room rooftop bar with great views. Staff super friendly.  Champagne welcome drink on arrival.  Staff pointed us to the Metro ATM sights etc. Buffet breakfast  one of the best I have had as an in inclusion. Locality near Metro 
eateries and 1 km to waterfront. Near Gothic quarter, heaps of history. Special shout out to Rafael who gave us all the tips on where to go and eat in Pamplona our next stop.",5,2024,06,04
23,"Great staff, bad room for sleeping","First I must say that the staff at check in was amazing. Very very friendly and helpful. 

However, we wouldn’t stay there again based on the room. 
- the beds were extremely firm. The hardest on our month long tour of Europe. 
- the air conditioning was fine when it was on. But it turned off every 3 hours making the room uncomfortable to sleep in. We had to get up every 3 hours to turn it back on. 
-  Our room had a very strange layout. There was no door to the bathroom which was fine, but the glass shower was literally a few feet away from the bed.  
- the breakfast was our least favorite breakfast of the entire trip as well. We thought the options were just average and not as big as we hoped. 

The rooftop area was nice.",2,2024,06,03
23,Wonderful place to stay,Beautiful hotel with a spectacular roof top.  All of the staff are so nice and helpful.  They went out of their way to accommodate us. It is the only hotel I've ever been to that lets you shower there if you check in too early and you can't get to your own room yet.  Loved it there!  It is also in a great location.,5,2024,06,03
23,First time to Barcelona,"The service was top notch from the moment we pulled up to the curb. Zak and Rafael were on the spot to take our bags and escort us into the hotel to registration. I had notified the hotel of our 40th anniversary and a bottle of Cava was on ice waiting for us. The staff was always asking if there was anything we needed or if there was anything they could do. The breakfast every morning was delicious and very satisfying. The rooftop bar was a favorite place to have a cocktail and take in the view.
 The location of the hotel made it an ideal spot from which to explore the city and the room was over the top and very comfortable. The next time we are in Barcelona, we would not consider staying anywhere else. All of the staff were exceptional!",5,2024,06,01
23,"Great service,location, and comfy bed","We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Ohla. Jave at the reception desk went out of his way to ensure we had a pleasant and comfortable stay. All of the hotel staff were very helpful, friendly, and made our stay extra special. The rooftop bar has great views and was a nice way to end each day sipping wine and watching the sun set over the city. The hotel was conveniently located near shopping, dining, and the Gothic quarter. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I will definitely stay here again if ever back in Barcelona.",5,2024,05,31
23,A fantastic oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Barcelona.,"Perfectly located hotel, everybody went above and beyond to satisfy our needs and preferences. The rooftop was amazing at night. We truly enjoyed our stay and will be back for sure. Please make sure to thank Zac and Quique for all their help and fantastic service. The private driver they got for our transport was also fantastic kudos to Victor.",5,2024,05,30
23,Five star hotel in fantastic location,Wonderful location in the heart of the gothic quarter. We booked through Mr & Mrs Smith and there was a bottle of Cava and box of chocolates waiting for us in our room. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. Would throughly recommend.,5,2024,05,30
23,Great hotel,"Great hotel in a great location. We spent most of our time in Barcelona out of the hotel but from check-in to the lovely rooftop bar, the service was great. Room was nice and modern. We didn't sample breakfast but did have some very tasty nibbles at the rooftop bar.",5,2024,05,30
23,Amazing Javi and Zac -,"From the moment we arrived, Zac and Javi treated us impeccably. We arrived way before check in, but were made very comfortable on the beautiful roof top bar. When our room was ready, reception called us, dropped the keys to us and put our luggage in our amazing room.

Javi really made our time at the hotel special, helping with attraction tickets and suggesting the most amazing places to eat - nothing was too much trouble. 

Zac was so friendly and helpful, again going out of his way to help and make us feel at home.

Excellent service, fabulous hotel, superb staff and brilliant location - the best of the best. We will be back",5,2024,05,29
23,Hotel stay,Outstanding hotel with exceptional staff and high standard throughout. We are returning guests and our experience was equal to our last stay. Check in was seamless and very friendly. We dined at the roof top bar and again exceptional food and service. Will stay again.,5,2024,05,27
23,Wonderful 5 Star experience at Ohla Barcelona.,"We had a wonderful experience at Ohla Barcelona during our visit earlier this month.  The hotel is in a great location which allowed us to easily walk to the beach, the Gaudi House...and the Sagrada Familia.  The room was contemporary, clean, well maintained and we loved having the glass shower in the middle of the room!  We didn't get a chance to have dinner at the hotel, but the breakfast buffet was a great way to start each day and the rooftop bar and pool should not be missed.  That said the best thing about the hotel was the team at the Ohla.  Everyone was very professional and couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable.  If we return to Barcelona, Ohla would definitely be our hotel of choice.  A true 5 star property.",5,2024,05,26
23,Spectacular!!! Five Stars well-earned,"From the time we were welcomed to the time we left, the staff treated us like VIPs. Clearly, there is a culture at the hotel of service with a smile and a genuine desire to help. This was clear with EVERY employee.

Additionally, the property was spectacular. I highly recommend it.",5,2024,05,24
23,Very happy with our stay,We loved Ohla! Perfect location in the gothic quarter. Barcelona cathedral is minutes away on foot. So many cafes and restaurants and shops and supermercats to choose from.  Will definitely be returning. Highly recommend the hotel’s restaurant La Plassohla for dinner (pan con tomate with anchovies and both the croquettes are a must). I’m already missing their refreshing mango y piña cocktail from the rooftop. Just beautiful!,5,2024,05,23
23,Simply Amazing!!!!,"We were so pleased with our visit and stay at Ohla Barcelona. The staff, our room, and the entire facility were simply amazing. The rooftop facilities are stunning and the restaurants sublime. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wanted to make a special stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,05,21
23,You won't be disappointed at the Ohla.,"The staff were amazing. So helpful and cooperative.  Appreciated the hypo-allegeric pillows.  Wonderful,super large room. Lots of storage space which was a blessing for two sisters with lots of ""stuff"" sharing a room.  Fluffy towels, free water, welcome bottle of champaigne, chocolates on bed every night.  Just bliss!  Perfect location as well.
In Paris now at a very pricey hotel that does not compare to the Hotel Ohla. Would recomend anyone to the Ohla for their stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,05,14
23,Super hotel,Excellent hotel. Modern contemporary decor and style. Lovely room. Great rooftop bar and vibe. Staff were brilliant. Location very good for the gothic centre and easy to get everywhere. Nice gym and sauna just across the corridor which was never busy.,5,2024,05,13
23,Highly recommended central Barcelona hotel,"An amazing hotel, located really centrally in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter. The welcome we received was exceptional, including one of the manager's showing us all the features of the room. Throughout the stay, thoughtful attention to detail such as a welcome bottle of prosecco on arrival, nightly turndown service, and knowing when our first morning at the breakfast buffet was, all made our experience memorable. 

Ohla has a fab rooftop bar, which non-hotel guests queue outside for, yet each time we visited we were prioritised and made welcome. The tapas restaurant on the ground floor also served a great evening meal.

This hotel is nearby Las Ramblas, Place de Catalunya, Arc de Triomph and we also walked to the Segrada Familia and Casa Batllo from its location. 

Definitely recommended and will look our for other hotels from the Ohla group.",5,2024,05,11
23,A wonderful stay,"The hotel is well situated to many sites in the city which made walking to most, easy. The staff is very professional, friendly, gladly made reservations and ticket purchases for us when requested, and did all they could to make our stay memorable. Chocolates at reception, at turn-down service, and other small amenities all contributed to our wonderful experience. 
I unfortunately had a medical emergency and the hotel staff could not have been more professional and helpful in arranging for me to get to a hospital. 
If you prefer small boutique hotels, Ohla is a great option.",5,2024,05,10
23,Hotel Ohla Barcelona is the  only hotel I would recommend to my friends,Amazing hotel which is in the Gothic Quarter and is perfectly located. The staff were extremely helpful and booked some great restaurants for us. The jewel in the crown is the rooftop pool and bar with spectacular views over the city. I highly recommend.,5,2024,05,08
23,"Location, comfort, service and atmosphere just right!","Luxury hotel with a perfect atmosphere in a great  location. Great service too.

Our room was spacious, comfortable and despite the great view of the heart of Barcelona was surprisingly quiet. 

The pool (until 4) and rooftop bar (4 on) has mesmerising views of the city, and if you’re staying here, just wonder up there.

Great breakfast, they do the most delicious fried eggs on request. Buffet good. 

The service was excellent but biggest shot out to the doormen who were so friendly and attentive. The guy who checked us in, I think he was maitre d, was also very friendly. 

The location is near all the best bits of old Barcelona (the best bit), just a short walk. 

Based on location, comfort and service we would go back.",5,2024,05,07
23,Highly recommend!,Amazing service. They helped us with everything we asked for. They even packed us a breakfast for our early morning ride to the airport. Great location. The rooftop bar is awesome. We would definitely stay again if we ever find ourselves back in Barcelona.,5,2024,05,06
23,Ohla Barcelona a great experience,"Had fantastic stay at the ohla Barcelona hotel. Location is perfect. 
I like to point out Baba was great in helping with luggage and extremely helpful. Sayuri on reception was exceptional as she helped daily on our planning and sorting out directions and clear explanations. 
Great room but the shower area was all glass and no privacy but Sayuri went the extra mile and organised the staff to put in plastic sheeting to make the shower more private. She made our stay very enjoyable. The staff were very helpful courteous and professional in every way.",5,2024,05,06
23,Remember Names - I'll remember this hotel,"The check-in gentleman was the best anywhere in the world.  Truly gifted remembering names (which alas ironically, I didn't catch his).  He started the stay well, and it was very much enjoyed.  Some very nice touches expected in a high class hotel.  Rooftop view is great. Location is perfect.",5,2024,05,03
23,Best in town,"Fantastic location in the middle of the city surrounded by cafes shops and restaurants . Beautiful room wich was quiet on top of that (junior suite) . Incredible rooftop with a bar and pool to enjoy the sunny hours of the day.

23,An English couple from New York,"The junior suite was wonderful. Design and style in the room was very relaxing, and certainly helped to make the occasion special. The roof top bar and pool provided a great place to relax each evening before heading out to dinner. The hotel is central to everything, and I must call out the reception and door staff for their extremely welcoming banter. We arrived at 8am from an overnight flight and were offered a place to shower and change if we needed it.

23,Perfect Stay in Barcelona,"Here is a review of our 6 day stay at Ohla.

We stayed for my partners 30th Birthday and can honestly say it was the best experience we have had. The attention to detail.

Customer service. Small details such as cava brought to the room, handwritten notes were a lovely touch. The hotel went out of their way to make our time here special

The shower is slightly unusual, and it could pose a problem if you were sharing the room with a friend opposed to a partner but otherwise i honestly cannot fault it.

Thankyou for being so accommodating.

23,Great experience,"We have come back from a wonderful long weekend, staying in Ohla Barcelona. Everyone's was friendly and welcoming, and we were looked after so well, from being greeted at the door, to the rooftop bar, for making sure we had blankets and heaters to keep us warm, it was rather blustery some nights, to reception helping us with tickets to attractions, restaurant recommendations and reservations, and booking taxis when needed. Our room was always clean, with fresh towels changed regularly, and water kept stocked. We are still not sure about the shower in the middle of the room, but maybe we are getting a bit old. Overall our break would not have been so lovely without everyone at Ohla Barcelona going that extra mile. Thank you.",5,2024,03,05
23,Top class hotel!,This hotel is very special. The location is perfect and the rooms very clean and contemporary. The front of house staff are incredibly helpful and cannot do enough. I would highly recommend a stay here and I will definitely be returning with my family next time,5,2024,03,05
23,Truly 5 star service,"A welcoming, well-managed, hotel.  Good beds, a little noisy given the popularity of the rooftop bar and the MIchelin-* restaurant., so if you are noise sensitive, I'd suggest asking for a non-street side room.  Great roof scene, pool and we loved the sauna which is hotter than Hades. We've stayed in some better-known and swanky hotels but the service here beat the pants off many famous places.  The breakfast is 100~ Only negative I could think of was if someone had eyesight impairment.  There is a sleek black decor throughout, that makes for some challenges if eyesight is an issue.  This hotel was a pleasant surprise for us and while we thought we wanted to stay in Gracia area, this location was very walkable to everything we wanted to do.",5,2024,03,04
23,Beautiful Barcelona visit,"Beautiful hotel, great location, very friendly and helpful staff who made sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. We got to the hotel early and fully expected we will not be able to check in until 3 pm but Javi made sure he helped accelerate the check in process. He gave us recommendations for lunch while waiting and after our meal we were able to get into our room. Rafael at the concierge was equally thoughtful and made sure he assisted us as needed. Highly recommended!",5,2024,02,26
23,Fantastic experience,"We stayed in junior suite. The room was very clean and spacious! Bed was very comfortable. 
The staff at front desk is great and very friendly! They provo us city map and information about the cites we wanted to visit. 
We would recommend this hotel if you’re are looking for a place within the city.",5,2024,02,24
23,Wonderful hotel and lovely staff - thoroughly recommend,"My wife and I just had the best short break in Barcelona staying at the wonderful Ohla Barcelona. All the staff were lovely, friendly and could not do enough for you and it's location for us to walk to all the sights was fantastic. Plus it was only 5 minute walk away from Placa de Catalunya, which is where the Aerobus stops, meaning the transfers to/from the airport was very easy. 

Check-in was a very smooth experience and we liked the nice touch of being offered a variety of refreshing drinks to quench the thirst. When we got to to the room we were very pleasantly surprised to find a nice bottle of cava on ice.

The Concierge was very helpful in taking the time to inform us of some places/bars to visit.

 The Roof Top Bar was also a lovely experience, with a great ambience and views of the city. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,02,23
23,A Rollercoaster Ride from Meh to Yeah!,"So, here’s the scoop on our adventure at Ohla Barcelona. My partner and I hit this spot to toast to our engagement—big times, right? The welcome wagon at this joint was top-notch. Think of walking into a party where you’re the guest of honor. That’s how the staff made us feel the second we stepped in. A solid gold start for what we hoped would be an epic stay.

Room Roulette: Our first room was a blast from the past, but not the cool, vintage kind. More like, “Oops, we forgot to update heavily used items.” The shower wood was all swollen and cracked, like it took a long soak and never dried off. The buzz from the street made it feel like we were sleeping on the sidewalk, and the decor? Let’s just say it had seen better days. We’re talking chipped furniture, a TV that’s seen too many late nights, and some “vintage” (not in a good way) cupboard action.

Service with a Smile: Not ones to settle, we voiced our concerns. And guess what? The Ohla team came through. They whisked us away to a room that was everything the first one should’ve been—modern, quiet, and just right. Plus, they surprised us with a little something to celebrate our engagement. Talk about turning things around!

Wishlist Wonders: If I could ask for a bit more, it’d be those little luxuries that make a stay extra special. A shoe shine kit for those night outs, a comb (because who remembers to pack those?), and a few more of those fancy coffee pods and teas. It’s the little things that count, especially when you’re dropping some serious cash.

Morning Glory: Breakfast at Ohla was like hitting the buffet jackpot—so much to choose from, so little time. Though, a fresh egg and some real-deal butter would’ve made my morning. But hey, the spread was still pretty awesome.

Staff Shoutouts: The real MVPs of Ohla? The staff. These folks know how to treat you right, making sure we felt like the stars of the show. From the rooftop bar to the unseen sauna (next time, for sure), they made every moment count.

The Verdict: Would I hit up Ohla Barcelona again? In a heartbeat. Sure, there are spots that might get the little things a tad more spot-on, but the vibe and service here? Unmatched.",4,2024,02,21
23,OHLA - We really liked it here - 5 Stars!,"We (Family of 4) would give Ohla Hotels 5 stars! The location is in the middle of the old town, easy to reach and perfect if you want to discover the city by food. The rooms are perfect - very nice interior, practical and super clean. The breakfast is very rich in terms of juices and quality of food. The roof top provided us a nice swim every morning and some unforgettable nights. And last but not least: we saw an extremely motivated, positive, competent and very friendly team from before our arrival to the very last minutes. We all four felt welcome and super positive for our complete stay of one week. We rarely ever say this: we clearly will come back to Ohla and can fully recommend a stay here.",5,2024,02,18
23,"Really cool hotel, great service.","The decor in the hotel is amazing, such cool interiors.
The rooms are a good size and the decor follows through to the rooms. 
The staff could not have been more helpful with anything we needed.
The rooftop bar is perfect for a drink after a day sightseeing...even in February.
The breakfast is not extensive but is more than plenty and fresh.
The location is great just on the edge of the Gothic Quarter so just a short walk to fantastic restaurants and bars.

23,Exceptional once-in-a-lifetime memory.,Ohla Barcelona made my Mother's 80th birthday and our Family Reunion a priceless and unforgettable event that could not have happened without the loving and caring kindness in this beautiful hotel and city. They created a home-like atmosphere and provided a wonderful experience. The trip was an exceptional once-in-a-lifetime memory. THANK YOU!,5,2024,01,21
23,Great location,Great location and rooftop restaurant and pool.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The room size was good but the bathroom was black so a little dark and hard to see what you were doing.  You can walk to almost anything from here and teh metro is very close.,5,2024,01,20
23,The best ,"Very good hotel, the staff is very professional and helpful especially Ms. Souyri the receptionist she is very kind.
The location is perfect close to . The rooms is very comfortable and clean.
 you cant open the window that was the only thing i didn't like.
The rooftop is very beautiful the view amazing I totally recommend.",5,2024,01,19
23,The best boutique hotel experience!,"My stay at Ohla was so memorable because of the extraordinary service & commitment they provided during our stay. Each of team members showed compassion to made the entire experience feel like we were home away from home! Javi went all out to help me as I didn't speak Spanish. I was fortunate to have interacted with such a great team - Daniel, Alba, Iraia, Javi, Zak, & Amine - thank you all so much! I miss you all already!",5,2024,01,16
23,Fab hotel - hard to leave!,"We only had a couple of days in this beautiful city and we are so glad we chose Ohla. The room was stunning and the roof top bar is magical. It was very hard to tear ourselves away from the hotel as it offers all you need - groovy rooftop bar overlooking the city, exceptional front desk service from Javi, fabulous tapas and breakfast and in the most central location. We loved it!",5,2024,01,15
23,Awesome Hotel Ohla!!,"The hotel was very nice.  Service there was over the top.  The hotel is located close, walking distance,  to many tourist attractions.  I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend Hotel Ohla to all.  I will stay there on my trip to Barcelona.",5,2024,01,15
23,Anniversary trip,"Our Travel council booked this hotel for us for a three night anniversary trip

Fabulous location, beautiful rooms we had a junior suite. We had two bottles of complimentary Cava in our room, one when we arrived and one on the day of our anniversary. 

The concierge staff are so friendly and helpful reception staff gave us some great advice on where to go 

The food on the first evening was amazing in the restaurant downstairs, but we did feel that breakfast was not as good 

On our anniversary, we decided to dine in the Michelin star restaurant 
Definitely a experience which took about four hours with the tasting menu 
Very attentive service 

Even though it was January, it was still lovely to have a drink on the rooftop bar overlooking the city",4,2024,01,09
23,Very good,"The location is very good, just a 5-min walk from the airport bus station and walkable distance to many attractions in the city.  
The staff are very nice and helpful.
The fridge in the room is small but can store many items, even an opened bottle of sparkling wine.  
The room is big enough (31 sqm) to open 2 big baggages.
However, the toilet in the room (#307) had a small problem and sometimes water keep running out.",5,2024,01,06
23,Perfect hotel to stay Barcelona for all ages,"Our stay at Ohla Barcelona was the absolute BEST. From the staff to room and location of the hotel, I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for anyone coming to visit Barcelona. 

We stayed at the hotel over Christmas and New Years. The staff were extremely professional and friendly. Our inbound flight got canceled and they immediately notified us for any accommodation changes. They were also knowledgeable in answering all our questions regarding Barcelona culture and places to visit. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable with staff members coming both in morning and/or afternoons to do any additional cleanings (they also gave small complimentary chocolates, cava, and massage oil). Finally, the location is situated perfectly near the La Rambla, Gothic Quarter, Mercat de la Boqueria, and Platja de la Barceloneta. ",5,2024,01,04
23,My time at the Ohla Barcelona hotel,The breakfast buffet was good the dinner was a bit fancy for me and the waiter got my order wrong. The rooftop view was incredible but the drinks were very overpriced. The rooms were good and were not that small with enough space for two people.,3,2024,01,03
23,NOT A 5* HOTEL,"This is simply not a five star hotel. It’s bones such as the building, the rooms, the decor are top notch but the flesh namely the quality of the breakfast, the lack of the information in the rooms ( not even a qr code) , & the disinclination of the staff to really help mean it is just not up to standard. 
Appoint the rooms with some decent technology, reduce the quantity but increase the quality of the items offered for breakfast & if a guest purchases a 35€ ( sic)  from you at least offer to bring a corkscrew to their room rather than bring it down themselves.
Alternatively be honest & rebrand as a 4* boutique hotel .",3,2024,01,02
23,Service was incredible!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The service was top notch throughout! The breakfast was delicious, the rooms clean and spacious and the roof top is gorgeous! Cant wait to come back and do it all again! We also enjoyed the sauna during one of our down days.",5,2023,12,28
23,Perfect time,The hotel team is the best in this hotel. We were so satisfied with the excellent services we got. The only problem is that the rooms are without fresh air as the hotel is a historic building which doesn't allow to open the window,5,2023,12,26
23,Excellant hotel,"Wonderful hotel, staff were very friendly after the first meeting, every time we saw one they knew are names, room large and comfortable, chocolates on the bed each night. The glass shower was amazing, not so if you are just friends staying together, we found it fun. The roof top bar is worth a visit especially at night. I was there for my 75th birthday surprise, the staff made me very happy sending up a card and a bottle for me, we had water every day and refilled our coffee and tea station, breakfast was a really good affair always fresh, diner at night was worth going to, our last evening my husband booked for us to go to the Michelin star restaurant at the hotel, lots and lots of courses more than I’ve had at other good restaurants, took us three hours to eat but, well worth it, many thanks to all the staff for a really fabulous stay",5,2023,12,24
23,Awesome hotel. Impeccable service ,"While this is one of the pricier hotels, it is well worth paying for as the hotel and rooms and service are impeccable. They are attentive and very helpful, making me feel welcome and comfortable from the moment I entered the hotel. Will definitely recommend to anyone heading to Barcelona and would definitely consider staying at Ohla again!",5,2023,12,10
23,A great hotel made even better by its staff,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The hotel is lovely with neutral and darker colours throughout the hotel creating a relaxed internal atmosphere. Artwork is tasteful, interesting and intriguing, both internally and externally. We stayed in a spacious and comfortable deluxe junior suite. Sound proofing in the room is low although we slept well and enjoyed a few siestas! We visited for my wife’s 40th and couldn’t be happier with our decision. The hotel is perfectly located being walking distance from most attractions/areas with the metro adjacent to the hotel. The breakfast was very good and plentiful. We enjoyed the rooftop bar each day with guests given priority ensuring we always enjoyed the sunshine and sunsets! All the staff were friendly and courteous with concierge Raphael leading the way! A genuinely lovely guy, always greeting us with his warm smile and always used our names. Incredible when you think of how many names there are to remember. Thank you Raphael, you really helped to make our stay truly enjoyable",5,2023,12,08
23,Amazing & memorable in every way,"I was very excited to visit Barcelona as I hadn’t been for many years and the whole trip was made even better by the amazing experience at this hotel!
From the moment we arrived everything was exceptional! Staff were friendly, helpful and professional and made our experience special. From personalized notes and amenities, to assisting us track down lost luggage to an amazing Tapas meal at La Plasshola. The rooftop bar is also beautiful and a great way to spend the afternoon and sunset was gorgeous!
The location of the property is right at the edge of the Gothic quarter and close to many attractions. 
I couldn’t recommend this property enough!",5,2023,12,05
23,Top notch boutique hotel,The hotel is very beautiful and our room was small  but very clean.   The shower was kind of in the middle of the room which was different. From the moment we walked in the service was outstanding. We arrived very early and knew we were more than likely not able to check in however they offered us the ability to shower and freshen up in the workout area which was very nice and private. The rooftop bar has beautiful views and they offer this nut medley for snacks that is so good we were able to purchase a bag to take home. If we come back we will definitely stay here again!,5,2023,12,05
23,Our stay at Ohla in BCN!,"Being welcomed by a super friendly and caring staff, only strenghtens the feeling of coming home ( again ) in this beautiful city. We even got to experience a nice and early X-mas present.

Combined with a very nice and modern accomodation, we can only recommend to drop by and experience this yourselves. 

Nothing is too much for this ever-laughing staff.

Looking forward to our next visit!",5,2023,12,04
23,4 day Barcelona break,"Boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter in the centre of this great city, modern and really quiet. Breakfasts excellent and we tried the restaurant as well and had a great dinner. A must is the roof terrace for wonderful views of the city and good even in the winter as blankets available and heaters per table so good place to sit back and enjoy
We had amazing help from reception and the two concierges and saw places that we might have missed
An all round trip that will be long remembered, thank you Hotel Ohla!",5,2023,12,04
23,"Enjoying Barcelona & Hotel Ohla in November, early December","My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona for our 20th anniversary in the junior deluxe suite at the end of November.  The hotel is ideally situated near many city highlights.  I loved the boutique feel and the warm greetings from everyone in the hotel.  They were very helpful.  The bed was perfect and helped me sleep soundly.  The morning breakfast buffet was lovely, a nice selection and a great way to start the day.  The weather was lovely this time of year, the Christmas markets were on full display and less crowded than during the summer.  This is my time of year to travel!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona and would highly recommend it to others.",5,2023,12,04
23,"Brilliant experience, great location, highly recommended.","I was in Barcelona with my wife to celebrate a milestone birthday and we booked to stay at this hotel for 3 nights. Every bit of the experience from check-in to check-out was memorable. 

The staff were so thoughtful to work out it was my birthday (we did not mention it to them) and left me little messages throughout the day to wish me. First with a little cake at breakfast and then balloons and champagne in the room when we returned. 

The hotel is extremely well located and you can walk to all the key places for tourists and shopping. Also has a metro stop right across the street so connectivity is amazing. 

The rooms are super well thought out, so clean and well maintained. And I loved the storage  wardrobe space. Made such a different to how we settled in for a few days. 

Our booking was breakfast included and we really enjoyed the offering each morning. Good selection and variety. Helped us make a great start each morning. 

I would highly recommend a stay at Ohla Barcelona and look forward to going back at some point.",5,2023,11,28
23,A Nice Splurge!,"This hotel was top notch! On a recent trip to Barcelona, we decided we would pick a nice modern hotel and Ohla Barcelona did not disappoint! It was centrally located and close to restaurants, shopping, sightseeing landmarks, and public transit.  We were able to take a bus from the airport to close to the hotel (less than 5 minute walk), and then go to the same area to grab a train to the train station (faster than driving).

The staff were impeccable.  We were warmly greeted and spoke to in the language of our choice.  When we went to breakfast the next morning, the hostess noted it was our first time and gave us a quick review of our options (a simple gesture, but a nice touch).  We went up to the rooftop to have a drink, and again we were warmly acknowledged.  When you are far from home, it’s nice to be treated this way.

We had a fridge in our room and they provided complimentary bottles of water daily.  (Again, a nice touch.)

If I had to say something negative, it would be something out of the hotel’s control.  Since the hotel was so well situated, it could be a little noisy at night when trying to sleep.  I didn’t hear traffic, but you would hear people loudly talking.  That said, it would not deter me from staying here again.",5,2023,11,27
23,Hotel Ohla in Barcelona,"What a lovely hotel to stay at in Barcelona's Gothic quarter. The staff are super helpful & friendly, & being our first time in Spain were more than happy to spend as much time as we needed in providing information & answers to our many questions. The hotel restaurant was fantastic, lovely atmosphere & food, we had breakfast & dinner there most days we stayed. Of course the roof top bar & pool are a must to visit in the late afternoon or evening for a glass of wine to take in the view. Location is very central too & super easy to get around. We would definitely stay there again.",4,2023,11,25
23,Wonderful hotel and employess,We stayed 2 nights and from the welcome champagne to the warmness of the front desk we felt at home. The view from the pool/bar is spectacular. The 2nd day my wife came down with a 24 hour bug and the hotel went overboard to help me. From the front desk to the restaurant to the cleaning service they were very helpful.  In our travels of over 30 years we have never felt more welcomed. If we ever get back to Barcelona we will certainly stay at OHLA BARCELONA. ,5,2023,11,23
23,Lovely hotel,"This was a lovely hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay there, and all of the amenities. The staff was absolutely fantastic and we received outstanding service throughout our stay. The hotel itself is also beautiful, especially the rooftop view. I hope that we’re able to stay here again in the future. ",5,2023,11,22
23,Only good things to say. ,"Only good things to say. Great location in the gothic area, close to the city bus, cabs and a 10 min walk to the starting hop on/ off bus location. Beautiful building and attention to detail throughout. Although we did not get to enjoy due to our short stay the gym, sauna, rooftop area all looked spectacular. The breakfast option is a must, great selection, presentation and service. ",5,2023,11,22
23,Best hotel:),"Absolutely incredible hotel!!! Staff was friendly and passionate- Javi went out of his way to make sure our trip was amazing. From making dinner reservations, to checking availability and booking local attractions, Javi made sure we made the most out of our stay. The hotel in general is very pleasant. Champagne bottles and chocolates left in the room multiple times which was a great plus ( even brought me balloons on my birthday) :-). 24/7 service and great rooftop and restaurants- very good breakfast that was included. Surrounding area is also great, everything is walking distance. 100% would recommend to everybody!!!",5,2023,11,20

23,Ohla what else ?,"Ohla  again and again......
I stayed in Ohla now let´s say 30times!
I always come back. I like the place off course, rooftop is great. 
But what´s most important are the people. 
All of them are great in there own way. When you arrive maybe Rafael and Zak will greet you. Concierges Javier and Quique are always helpful. Breakfast you see Anna and the the day will be fine. There are so many beautiful people try it ...
The Hotel has also a great manager- you can feel his passion for hospitality.
So I will come back soon , of course.
",5,2023,11,19
23,Fantastic hotel,"An absolutely fantastic hotel with superb staff. We celebrated the friend's birthday and asked the hotel for something extra, perhaps at tapas on the Top Roof. It was an improbable courtship with many helium balloons, cake and Kava in the room. The birthday boy so happy. Wonderful to sit on the roof and look out over Barcelona in the warm November evening Very good food. Exciting solution for shower rooms and toilet doors. Artistic environments. Close to everything. We would love to return here.

Our room ( a Jr. suite) was well appointed with everything you could want. A very nice touch was the bottle of Cava on our arrival and also the tasty chocolates left on our pillow each night! Breakfast was included and it had a great spread of fruit, meat, cheeses, pastries, eggs sausage bacon and more!  There was also a cool outdoor bar on the roof that had wonderful views and a glass   walled pool. Great for a drink before or after dinner. When we head back to Barcelona we certainly will stay there again.  The Ohla hotel was a delightful part of vacation and made our trip to Spain that much more special.  Thank you Ohla staff, we will be back!",5,2023,11,12

23,Best hotel in Barcelona!,"The Ohla is centrally located, with easy walking to the Cathedral of Barcelona and the many ""old world"" shops.  We had scheduled tours and easily walked to the tour locations.  The hotel staff is friendly and truly want to provide a wonderful experience.  Daniel at the front desk is helpful as is Francisco and his staff.  We would 1000% stay at the Ohla again!  Room accommodations are first class!  The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have experienced.  Great food and drink selections!  ",5,2023,10,29

23,The Perfect Hotel!,"Ohla Barcelona offers the quintessential Barcelonian experience.  From the moment we were met at the door by a friendly face to the reception desk staff to the view from the amazing rooftop bar, we were glad we chose Ohla.  Our room was very clean and modern, and the boutique hotel itself has a very contemporary vibe, while the location was perfect for exploring the iconic Gothic Quarter.  It also had easy access to the Hop-On Hop-off Bus.  However, it was the friendliness of the hotel management and its staff, which set Ohla apart. Nothing was too much trouble.  Their warmth permeated every interaction. While maintaining the professional environment of a large hotel, they offered the personal touch of a small one, making our visit one to remember.  On three-week trip to Spain and Portugal incorporating nine different hotels, this is the hotel that stood out as the best!  ",5,2023,10,26
23,Perfect Honeymoon,"We stayed in the Dome Suite for our honeymoon, it was the second time we have been to Barcelona and the second time we had stayed here, the staff are amazing, the hotel is stunning, the views over the city are incredible. 
Everyone went above and beyond to make our stay so fantastic, the little treats in the room, the constant kindness, always happy to help, the people at the reception desk always happy to order a taxi, book a table, even go outside and stop a taxi for us instantly.
We can’t fault the hotel or staff, we will be staying again and can’t wait.

23,Great location and customer service.  ,Excellent location in Barcelona.  Service was outstanding by everyone at the hotel.  We had lots of questions about the city and they were always available.

23,Say Hola to the Hotel Ohla!,"Wonderful stay at the beautiful Hotel Ohla!  We were there for 2 days after a cruise around the Mediterranean for my husbands birthday.  They accommodated us in all of our needs and treated us royally.  Champagne, Balloons and Chocolate to start our celebration!  We brought friends along with us and they upgraded them to a jr suite.  The beds and bedding are fabulous, the room is beautifully decorated and appointed with everything you need.  Our room had a bath tub and a shower - nothing like a good soak after our Gaudi immersion - walking 5 miles during the day!  The room was quiet even though we were on the corner facing the street.  Great views.  Breakfast was another high point - so many selections.  We spent an hour on the roof top bar the last night.  Beautiful views - Mojitos were fab - great service.  If I could give them 10 stars - they deserve it! ",5,2023,10,20
23,Excellent Hotel!,"This is a top-notch hotel in Barcelona.  Was not crazy about the location and would probably book outside of Gothic Quarter if we return to Spain, but that is personal preference on location.  The actual hotel was excellent and on par with a 5-star hotel.  The hotel staff and front desk always went above and beyond what was asked.  Iriana at the front desk was a gem and always so friendly and accommodating.

23,Barcelona Dream,"This beautiful hotel property was the last leg of a three week trip through Spain- Saving the best for last! It is not only a beautiful property, but it is also centrally located to every where you want to go from the marketplace to shopping or simply to connect to some of the more prominent historical, museums and cathedrals and Basilica. The art is unbelievable however, the staff at Ole Barcelona was exceptional, professional, courteous and went above and beyond in terms of customer service to all its customers.

The staff assisted us in train reservations from Barcelona to Madrid, provided restaurant recommendations and made reservations for us. The onsite restaurant was excellent. The room was lovely with the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in. We stayed for 8 days and felt more like family than guests. I would highly recommend the Ohla and we hope to return in the future for another visit.",5,2023,09,21
23,Stay at the OHLA hotel. You won't regret it.,"I am sooooooooo glad that I booked at OHLA Barcelona. To begin, the hotel was in the perfect spot in the Gothic Quarters. You're literally just a walk away from the Cathedral, Placa De Cataluyna, Las Ramblas, Picasso Museum. If you walk the opposite direction, you'll be right at Passeig de Gracia (to go shopping and if you walk further, more of the Gaudi casas).

The stay and service itself was incredible. The room, shower, accommodations in the room, the gym, sauna, etc were nice. The staff was absolutely superb. They were so welcoming. If we come back to Barcelona, we will be coming back here. We didn't get to try the restaurant with the Michelin Star Chef because it was already booked, but it's because we didn't  realize it until we were already there and they were already booked out.",5,2023,09,19
23,Definitely worth a visit…,"We stayed at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona for a long weekend which was delightful. Super friendly staff, delicious breakfast buffet and lovely hotel room. We stayed in a Deluxe Room on the 5th floor which was light and airy although a little smaller than we expected for the price we paid. Fantastic rooftop terrace with pool and great views and situated in a very central location for all the local sights. Would certainly recommend to fellow travellers 😊 🇪🇸",4,2023,09,19
23,"Couldn't ask for a friendlier,  helpful stay","Amazing boutique hotel.  Extremely helpful and friendly.  No request to small.   Javi truly enjoys his job and goes out of his way to please.

23,Hotel Ohla - Highly Recommend,"This hotel is located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, offering a convenient location for discovering various attractions all within walking distance and several shopping options.
Our first stay at this hotel turned out to be a great choice. It all began with a warm welcome, complimentary glasses of Cava at the rooftop bar, and a nice spacious room. The staff was very helpful and courteous throughout our stay.
The hotel provides an extensive breakfast selection, but the real gem is the rooftop pool and bar, one of the best in Barcelona. It's an ideal spot to relax after a day of city adventures, whether for a leisurely drink or a spot to unwind later in the day.",5,2023,09,17
23,Love the Ohla hotel.,"This hotel is based in the Gothic quarter which is central to most sites and shops. 
We have been to this hotel three times now and it’s always been amazing. Helpful and knowledgable staff. 
The hotel offers a good breakfast with lots to choose  from. The rooftop bar is an excellent place to relax and chill out after a long walk around the city or for an evening drink and snack. 
Would totally recommend this hotel.",5,2023,09,15
23,"The Best Hotel, with the Best Facilities in an Amazing Location","From the moment we entered Ohla Hotel Barcelona we were made to feel special and appreciated.

The staff welcomed us with a smile and a glass of Cava! (Other options available). 
They asked us about our journey and demonstrated that they were aware that I had asked questions ahead of our visit which showed that they knew all the guests they were expecting that day.

We were shown to our junior suite and given a tour as well, with any questions we had being answered. 

The facilities within our room and the hotel were amazing! The rooftop bar is a must!! And breakfast had any option you could ask for. 

There was always a staff member on hand to answer any questions and give advice on local attractions, restaurants and bars. Even giving advice on places they had been with their own family. 

The location of the hotel is also perfect! Close to all the main amenities and it was so easy to access other areas of Barcelona as well. 

There were road works outside of the hotel  during our stay but the glazing means that this could not be heard at all within the hotel and our junior suite was at the front of the hotel as well. 

We honestly had the best time in Barcelona and a lot of that is to do with where we stayed. If we head back to Barcelona we would absolutely stay with Hotel Ohla again and wouldn’t choose to stay anywhere else. ",5,2023,09,13
23,A great hotel with a fantastic team,"A great hotel is only made fabulous by the quality of its staff and this is certainly true at Hotel Ohla.

Rooms are very clean and well appointed,with stylish and comfortable accommodation.Communal areas are spotless and inviting. The rooftop area is a great addition with cosy nooks and lounge chairs,a great place to relax during the day and a destination for the evening.
Enough of the beautiful building,the people are the real stars! Attentive without being intrusive each member of the team from the housekeeping staff,concierge and reception team to the restaurant team all play their part in ensuring a memorable stay.
We will be back!",5,2023,09,06
23,Sets a new standard for 5 star hotel!,"I stayed 8 nights and came away thinking this hotel is superb!! It is one of the best places I have ever stayed. Aside from the amazing location, everything worked seamlessly and all staff (whether they worked at front desk, restaurants, concierge, cleaning) were  excellent at what they do. My experience of the service they offered puts many other 5 star hotels that I have stayed in to shame. I wish this sort of experience was more common in the hotel industry.",5,2023,09,06
23,Our Go-To Hotel,"We stayed at Hotel Ohla Barcelona as a newly engaged couple in 2019 and with our daughter in 2023. Barcelona is our favorite city, and we love to explore it from the comforts of Hotel Ohla. We have breakfast included in our stay, which includes a delicious buffet of fresh and delicious foods. We also spent most of our afternoons on the rooftop pool (with a special shoutout to the Rooftop staff, who are truly extraordinary and kind and take the extra effort to engage and dance with our toddler daughter). On my husband's birthday (which I mentioned to the concierge upon arrival only in passing to make a dinner reservation), the staff send champagne and chocolates and a kind note wishing him well. The amenities are extraordinary. Housekeeping did an incredible job each day, and yet I never encountered them. They were very thoughtful about when they were in our room (especially with our daughter's nap, it was never an issue). I highly recommend Ohla, either as a couple or a family!  ",5,2023,09,04

The hotel was so clean, my room was cleaned and restocked every day, i was made to feel so special by the hotel on my birthday too! Honestly I cannot wait to return!!! ",5,2023,08,31
23,Special hotel for my 40th. Made by Javi.C!,"Absolutely amazing hotel for my 40th. Was made special by a member of staff called Javi.C.

23,Amazing Hotel!,"Best customer service I’ve ever experienced. I have Celiac and my son has nut allergies. They helped us find places to eat, made reservations for us, but the most amazing part is that the person that runs the dining room for breakfast went to find my son snacks, on per personal time, so he could have something sweet and safe to eat with his breakfast. She already had gluten free snacks for me! Rooftop pool is really nice, and rooms are immaculate!",5,2023,08,22
23,A Remarkable Stay at Hotel Ohla Barcelona,"One of the nicest hotel experiences I have ever had. The staff at Ohla Barcelona truly make you feel welcome and appreciated. From the people working at the door to those at the front desk, the cleaning staff, the bartenders, the chefs, the waiters – everyone. Thank you for providing such a wonderful stay at your hotel.

Be sure to book a table at the Caelis restaurant and try to secure a seat at the bar/chef's table. Arrive hungry and relish the performance put on by the entire team working there – masterfully executed!

Don't miss the rooftop bar – exceptional drinks and a fantastic view! It's perfect for a pre-drink before immersing yourself in the city.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Barcelona.

Once again, a big thanks to all the individuals working at Ohla.",5,2023,08,21

The *entire* staff were attentive and warm with the front desk staff being exceptionally animated and friendly. Special shout-out to Salvatore.  

We were lucky enough to get a room upgrade for our stay. The Penthouse room was one of the most fantastic spaces I have *ever* seen - we had a duplex space with a lounge, a terrace overlooking magnificent Barcelona, and a spa-like bathroom. A fantastic blend of luxury without any compromise on comfort. The bed itself was like sinking into a cloud.  

Everything was magical - with so much attention to detail and special touches. I loved little things like a card on your bed after turn-down giving you an indication of the next day's weather forecast, and a call once we were in our room to ensure we were happy.  The area around the hotel is charming and wonderful with tons of shops and places to eat. We ate at the restaurant on-site which was superb. Breakfast too was fantastic with tons of options. I only wish we had time to make it to the rooftop pool and bar.",5,2023,08,18

Staff that accompanies you to your room and shows you all of its amenities. Have an exceptional night of sleeping on a luxurious queen bed with soft sheets and fluffed pillows…heavenly. You will have access to their spa, rooftop bar which has amazing views all around of the city.  Luciano is one of the fabulous servers up there who went out of his way to bring a chocolate brownie for my husband even after the restaurant had closed. Yes, unbelievable service and kudos to him! The tapas restaurant la Plassohla offered up delicious and unique assortments of tapas that were prepared, executed and tasted to perfection. I could just go on and on but I think it’s clear to see why this is a 5 star hotel that everyone deserves to enjoy whilst on holidays in Barcelona! ",5,2023,08,08
23,Barcelona in style!,"Truly a wonderful place to stay! The staff were all so attentive, from the front desk check-in and Zak who helped organize everything from taxis to laundry service.

The staff on the rooftop always welcomed us. Definitely earned its 5stars!",5,2023,08,08
23,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"Me and my husband stayed in Ohla Barcelona hotel last weekend and we had a few special requests (as part of our religious obligations). Usually it’s hard to explain this when we stay in hotels, but in this case the hotel's reception representative has contacted me in advance and made sure everything is being treated to our fullest satisfaction and also made sure to update his colleagues in the reception desk, just in case we face any problem and we need their assistance while he is not there. 
As part of my job I travel a lot in the world and stay in many hotels, and I must say I have never experienced such an excellent service and personal customer experience as I have experienced in Ohla Barcelona.  Thank you for giving us the best service possible and for putting exceptional efforts in order to make sure everything is going smoothly and that we feel comfortable.

Loved the extra nice touch of sparkling/water/lemonade out with truffles every day. The location is excellent -- easy walk to the catedral, La Rambla, other shopping and the Picasso Museum. There is a ton of construction going on in this area, but you'll find that throughout the city. I would happily stay here again. ",5,2023,08,04
23,It’s the people who make this a great hotel,What separates this hotel from other 5-stare hotels is the quality of the people who work there and their total commitment to help their guests in any and every way possible.  We had a couple of out-of-the-ordinary requests that were very important to us.  The front desk people could not have been more obliging and did everything possible to make these requests happen.  We used the restaurant several times.  Same thing.  The people who work there were so helpful.  Concierge desk was exactly the same.  This is a great hotel to stay at just because the people want your stay to be the best experience possible.,5,2023,07,30

23,Great location and even better experience,"My wife and I recently stayed at Ohla Barcelona.  We were greeted by the concierge who enthusiastically offered to make any arrangements for tours and visits for us.  We then were introduced to Daniel who checked us in.  Daniel is wonderful, personable, and a gracious host.  He represents the staff so well.
Our room was on an upper floor and quite nice.  I really enjoyed the layout, and the glass shower in the middle off the room, though I am sure others may have different thoughts.  The room was spacious, clean, and quiet.  The rooftop bar is quite the tourist attraction and one of the nice parts of being a guest is that we didn't have to wait to get a spot, we just went right up and got served.  It's a ""must do"" if you are staying at the hotel, as the views of the city are really beautiful.
Also, breakfast is included in the price of the hotel which made for a nice way to wake up.  Breakfast is pretty comprehensive and goes beyond just coffee and muffins.
Finally, the location is quite close to La Rambla, a metro stop, and many of the shops.
I highly recommend and would stay there if and when we return to Barcelona.",5,2023,07,27

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Right from the manager down, all staff were friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and really did everything they could to make our stay special. Our room was decorated with rose petals and a bottle of fizz for our 25th Wedding anniversary which was a lovely touch.  The hotel arranged a driver to take us to the GP circuit who was really great and very knowledgeable of the local area. Food at breakfast and in the Tapas restaurant were excellent. The roof top pool and bar is the place to be in the evening with people queing to get in every night but residents get priority. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. ",5,2023,07,16

23,Wonderful modern 5* Hotel in the middle of the Gothic quarter,"It was the perfect 5* Hotel for our taste with a relaxed boutique vibe. The service was outstanding and everyone was really friendly.  We had a well appointed modern deluxe room with a very comfy bed and lots of storage for clothes. Anything we asked for, they delivered to our room within 5 minutes.  The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of the Gothic quarter and the rooftop bar & pool is quite the draw every night. The breakfast selection was excellent and dinner at the resident restaurant Caelis was the best meal we have ever had on our many travels - outstanding wine pairings too. We would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys a more personal experience with a boutique style hotel.",5,2023,07,04

The breakfasts were amazing - don't miss including those with your stay.  Phenomenal location, easy walking distance to everything, and the rooftop bar is the place to be in Barcelona for sunset.  Unfortunately, we did not get an opportunity to dine at the Michelin-star restaurant in the hotel as it is dark Sunday - Tuesday.....  My wife loved this place and insists we stay there again next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2023,06,24

Metro stop just over the road from the hotel (we took the metro when we went to Park Guell).  
Thank you to all the staff who were very helpful – especially the front desk team and the doorman.

The hotel kitchen is amazing from breakfast to dinner.
The hotel offers rooftops dinning that has an incredible view.
However with everything great that hotel offers, the most perfect experience made by attentive staff, smiling and courteous attention.
given daily.
The front desk personal was incredibly amazing: Thank you, Zak, Ravi, Alina, Evgeny and others which the names we didn't catch but made a personal connection.
Our stay was beyond expectations and we are making Ohla hotel our first selection upon visiting again.

Thank you and best regards to my favorite stay in Barcelona.",5,2023,06,10
23,Best place to stay in Barcelona near Las Ramblas,"This Hotel was more than accommodating for our stay!  From the airport/cruise terminal transfers to the concierge recommendations. Our meals were excellent, room was nice  & view from rooftop bar was breathtaking!  I’ve already recommended to friends who will be visiting soon.",5,2023,06,09
23,Great location and rooms - superior staff,"We stayed at Ohla for 8 days and it was incredible. Alina made us feel welcome from the moment we sat down to check-in and she offered us glasses of Cava. 

Hotel guests have access to the rooftop bar - locals and tourists line-up to get in every night - that has amazing views of the city.  This was a highlight of the trip and we started every evening with a rooftop drink before dinner.  

Ohla is in a great location, you could spend a month exploring the neighborhood streets and never eat at the same restaurant twice.  The hotel is a very short walk from the Cathedral and Las Ramblas.

Breakfast is included with your room and is a generous spread of meats and cheeses, eggs, breads and amazing pastries, and it runs until 11:00 a.m. so there is no need to get up early -- especially after having dinner at 9:30 p.m.  

We had dinner at La Passohla in the hotel and it was very, very good.  The roasted pork and sweet potato puree was delicious.  It was a lovely way to relax and take a little break from tapas after walking and touring all day.

Caelis is the other restaurant at Ohla, it has one Michelin star and is amazing. We sat at chef's table next to the kitchen and enjoyed the meal of a lifetime. The food was inventive and so flavorful and the wine pairing was fantastic.  Everyone was so nice and welcoming, not at all pretentious, and explained all of the food and wine.  This was a highlight of our trip.

The rooms are clean and modern and have large closets and a large vanity, there was plenty of room for all of our toiletries and clothes. And when I needed an iron, it was delivered within 7 minutes of my call requesting it.

Alina wrote us a very sweet note and sent a welcome bottle of Cava to the room the first night and then again mid-way through the trip.  She was so attentive and always stopping to chat whenever we came in and out.  She helped us figure out transportation to the train station for our day trip to Spain and Rafael even packed us breakfast to take on the 7 am train! 

I cannot recommend Ohla highly enough!  Alina, Rafael, and all the staff made us feel like we were the most important guests and were incredibly welcoming and friendly.  

",5,2023,06,09
23,Amazing Hotel,"Hotel Ohla was the perfect hotel for our stay in Barcelona.  The staff was awesome and extremely accommodating.  The location of the hotel is perfect and right in the middle of where you want to be, and the room and rooftop were amazing as well ",5,2023,06,09

We’ll be back.",5,2023,06,07
23,"Beautiful, welcoming hotel!","When the check in process includes chocolate and a glass of cava, you know you are in for a great stay at this gem of a hotel.  Beautifully decorated with whimsical art, comfortable, well appointed room,  and a great roof top bar (for which you get to skip the queue) are all things you can expect at the Ohla.  The free breakfast at La Plassohla is a bounty of delicious treats: the eggs in a  cocotte was my favorite.  If I’m ever lucky enough to visit Barcelona again I will definitely stay at the Ohla!",5,2023,06,03
23,An Exceptional Team,"This hotel was exceptional! The team approach to taking care of their guest was incredible. From our early check in 7 am, they allowed us to use their gym facilities to freshen up, to an early room entrance 12pm, refreshments, an extra bed in our room,  The Doorman, Bellman, Hostess’s and  Concierge ( They are called the “Experience Team”) were so accommodating  , nothing was too much trouble.
Javi,  one of the Concierge’s, helped us navigate the Metro and train system, he got us concert tickets to a sold out show, assisted us getting FC Barcelona tickets, got us reservations to a Michelin Star restaurant and others! They really made us feel at home when we walked through the door.
The model in which they run this property and the team they have put together is Exceptioal!",5,2023,05,31
23,What a wonderful hotel!,"We stayed at Ohla Barcelona for 1 week, such a wonderful hotel. I will start by saying the staff are so friendly and welcoming everyday! Anything you need, they will get. From extra water to towels, no extra charge. Always with a smile. 
The hotel is clean and the rooms are cleaned twice per day. Big clean in the morning and refresh in the evening. Piece of chocolate at night was a nice finishing touch. 
Breakfast was always good, lots of choices from eggs to yogurt and fresh fruit. My husband loves their bread! 
Thank you Ohla for making our first stay in Barcelona so wonderful! ",5,2023,05,30
23,Excellent hotel with 5+ star staff!,From start to finish this was the BEST experience with a hotel staff I have ever experienced along my international travels!  At booking from the US I asked several questions which were quickly answered by email!  Check-in was a friendly and efficient experience with sparkling wine served!  Rooms were very nice and comfortable located within walking distance of harbor and shopping!  Breakfast was excellent and the rooftop bar was a great spot to unwind!  Concierge was extremely helpful setting up last minute tours and provided excellent dinner locations!  EVERY staff member went out of their way to make sure we were properly taken care of!  ,5,2023,05,30
23,Not For Everyone,"This hotel seems geared toward younger people.  The elevators and common areas  are not large and  quite dark.  It is a very hip place, so consider that.  The artwork in the lobby is great, all these large round white face with various expressions cover the very dark grey lobby walls.  Check in area is small as well.  

There is quite a bit of  street construction outside.  I suggest inquiring about that if choosing this hotel.",4,2023,05,27
23,Awesome stay! 5-stars experience,"This is obviously a 5 stars hotel with 5 stars rated room and services.
The location is at the heart of Barcelona, you can go everywhere with walking distance.
This trip to Barcelona is for our wedding anniversary. The staff surprised us with a bottle of sparkling wine straight to our rooms. The experience team did a great work to recommend and guide us to places and helped us to plan our trip more efficiently. Big shout-out to them. But, all the staff were super friendly and helpful. They are all fluent in English.
The bonus is their rooftop bar with great view of Barcelona. This bar is always packed, but if you stay, you will have priority to have a spot up here.
There was a Michelin star restaurant here as well, we were not lucky to have a spot, if you want to try, you should plan ahead.
Definitely will rebook Ohla in our next trip to Barcelona!",5,2023,05,26
23,Perfect hotel to stay in Barcelona,After a booking mix up by the hotel (their mistake) they rectified this by upgrading us to a amazing suite.

Shout out to the staff for helping us with transportation, reservations and understanding local customs. We will definitely be stay here again when we return. ",5,2023,05,21
23,A VIP Experience,"One of the most hospitable boutique hotels we've ever stayed in. Besides being beautiful, spotless and truly five star, comfortable rooms, great location, an incredible rooftop bar and daily breakfast buffet, it was as if they knew us. Every day greeted with a smile and a personalized hello. We asked for recommendations for restaurants, nearby areas to check out, amazing walks. They never steered us wrong. Truly a VIP experience. Felt like family. Thank you for the birthday love!",5,2023,05,21

23,May 2023,"Excellent location on the edge of the old town. You can walk too many of the main attractions with plenty of good restaurants close by. The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially the experience desk who can help with booking entry for all local attractions as well as transportation.

Rooms are decent size for a central location, clean and well appointed, with a roof top bar that has to be visited.

Highly recommend.",5,2023,05,20
23,Amazing stay!,"We have just arrived back from a 3 night break, I'm glad we chose Ohla as everything about it was amazing!
When we arrived, we were told we had been upgraded to a deluxe room as it was my birthday. Every single member of staff was lovely , so friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble.
Our room was spotlessly clean, I loved that the glass shower was in the room and the toilet separately.
Breakfast was delicious. There was everything you could want for breakfast , if it's not out, then ask as they are more than happy to make it for you, we had poached or fried eggs and even omelette, all made fresh to order along with drinks you would like such as cappuccinos.
The location is great also.
I would 100% recommend and will return again one day!",5,2023,05,20
23,Really excellent hotel in Barcelona ,"Hotel really great with lots of facilities, staff very attentive and friendly. Hotel located with easy access to prime locations. Has a rooftop bar and pool with fantastic views of Barcelona. Very well catered for all needs, the breakfast is extensive and a choice of restaurants within the hotel",5,2023,05,19
23,Treated like family,"Great place to stay in Barcelona. Staff went out of their way to make my wife and my stay memorable, including changing our room with no questions asked.

Would recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable base of operations while visiting Barcelona.",5,2023,05,19
23,Top 10 on my list of Barcelona hotels!,This hotel is centrally located in the historic Gothic Quarter.  Everything is within walking distance.  The rooms are very clean and we'll maintained.  The service is absolutely impeccable.  When we checked in they met us with cava and chocolate. They took care of all of our arrangements regarding travel and transfers to and from the airport.  I don't know where they're able to find this high quality of staff but they are certainly doing something right.,5,2023,05,19
23,Fabulous birthday trip,"Myself and my wife stayed in the Ohla Hotel on a trip with my son and his girlfriend. The hotel is perfectly located being close to Las Ramblas, the port, Gaudi House and for the more energetic, linger walks to Las Arenas and Sagrada Familia. The hotel is excellent with fabulous rooms, the rooftop bar/pool  is a must and the food was excellent. The staff are excellent, very friendly, helpful and attentive. Special mention to…. Javier, Carla, Sabrina and Bas on reception and chef Filipo.",5,2023,05,19
23,Best stay in Barcelona by far !,The Ohla Barcelona quite simply is a wonderful place to stay in Barcelona. It is located in the old part of the City and just a few steps from many interesting restaurants. And a walk to the Port area and beach is only fifteen minutes away. All staff at the Hotel especially Yevgen who greeted us on arrival are all so kind and helpful and this made our stay even more agreeable. You should consider the wonderful Ohla Barcelona before making your bookings. ,5,2023,05,17
23,Centrally located 5* hotel with unjustifiably high tariff  ,"We stayed at this hotel in the second week of May 2023 for 4 nights. First, the good things: 
•	Location- central location, everything within walking distance
•	Clean rooms with top notch linens 
•	Tea-coffee, chocolates and unlimited bottled water in the room
Things we didn’t like: 
•	Check-in experience: check-in clerk (someone called kiki or keke) was an unpleasant guy with a lot of attitude. Refused a chair to my third friend who had to remain standing for the whole longish check-in process. A specific request for a chair was turned down by stating that all the chairs are occupied by our respective wives (we were three couples). A five star hotel with only 5 chairs! 
•	A lot of repair work is going on surrounding the hotel including the main access/entry. Repair work makes lot of noise. Upon seeing this, we pointed out that this fact ought to have been mentioned on the website of the hotel for the sake of transparency. The check-in clerk initially said that even they did not know about the repair work. On being confronted that the repair work was huge and entire portion of the road was dug up with lot of machines and workmen could not happen overnight, he reluctantly agreed to inform his manager for doing the needful in the matter. However, we never had the pleasure of hearing from the manager during our entire stay.   
•	At check-in, read the fine prints on the form they make you sign! It has marketing and social media consents for sharing information/photographs without explicit mention of the same. 
•	Hotel has a dark theme, so everything is dark, if you are looking for bright and lighted hotel, this may not be the place for you.
•	Hotel does not have any Lobby to sit with your friends and visitors. 
•	Breakfast – for Vegan, breakfast remains the same every day.  
•	Toilet is in a closet with no day light and window! 
•	My room (junior suit) had balcony but not accessible for security and aesthetic reasons. (heritage property etc)
Conclusion: A centrally located good hotel with clean room but with the tariff it charges, there are certainly other better options in the surrounding area. 
",3,2023,05,15
23,Great location,The location of the hotel is superb and accessible to both ends of Barcelona as it’s very central. We had a bottle of Prosecco for the room as it was my birthday which was lovely and such a nice surprise! Service was 10/10 and front desk staff have us amazing recommendations. Roof top bar was also really cool! Definitely nice for a pre dinner drink! ,4,2023,05,15
23,Great location for your Barcelona stay!,Great location! Really nice boutique hotel.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast had a nice choice of foods.  The rooftop bar had great views.  We had a junior suite which was a good size and quiet.  Would definitely recommend. 5*,5,2023,05,14
23,4 days in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel in every way - position, comfort of the rooms, very helpful and attentive team on front desk, good porterage and a fine roof top bar. the hotel was an important part in what was a most enjoyable stay.",5,2023,05,12
23,Great location and hotel with amazing staff!,"The perfect location and hotel if you are staying in Barcelona.  The hotel was very clean, The hotel staff were super friendly and extremely helpful.  Daily breakfast was very good.  The rooms are a  nice size and well appointed with everything you need.  ",5,2023,05,09
23,The Perfect hotel!,"We first stayed at The Ohla 7 years ago and have always wanted to go back, so we were incredibly excited to be able to go back again this year in April for our 8th Anniversary. 
From start to finish the service we received was exceptional, all the staff made us feel really welcome and couldn’t do enough for us. From Jenny who checked us in, to Rafael, who showed us to our amazing room, Javier on the Concierge desk, to the bar team on the rooftop terrace,  all were genuinely friendly and helpful. 
The location of the hotel is perfect, the rooms are beautiful, the atmosphere around the hotel is relaxed and the breakfast is fantastic- we have also dined in the main restaurant previously, and the rooftop terrace is the icing on the cake, a stunning setting for cocktails! 
All of this made it the perfect place for us to get engaged and now the Ohla will always have a special place in our hearts. We can’t wait to go back again soon! ",5,2023,05,07
23,Phenomenal visit!,"I don’t usually write reviews (and am reluctant to do this one ONLY because it may mean the next time I want to stay here that it may be fully booked)…this place is THE BEST. I’ve paid as much at other hotels that don’t come close to the caliber of this one. The staff is the friendliest, most helpful staff I’ve ever experienced, hands down. The accommodations are wonderful (and that word isn’t adequate). I can’t wait to stay here again, and won’t even look at another hotel when I get the opportunity to do so. Barcelona is so fantastic and this hotel made the visit more than I could have asked for. Muchas gracias, hotel Ohla!!! See you soon!!!",5,2023,05,06
23,5* service in a beautiful hotel,"We had an incredible stay at Ohla Barcelona, made even better by the wonderful staff, who were so friendly and couldn’t do more to help us. They even surprised us with chocolates, Cava and rose petals as we had just married and were on our mini-moon. 

The rooms were comfortable and stylish, we’ve not had such a good nights sleep in a long time, and we appreciated the chocolate on the pillow in the turn down service. 

We also enjoyed the rooftop bar, where you can look onto the Cathedral rooftop, the sauna / gym and restaurant where they served a lovely breakfast buffet with delicious fruits and juices.

The hotel is centrally located in the gothic quarter, around the corner from the Cathedral which you can see from the rooftop bar. This is definitely the best, and prettiest area to stay in, close to shops / the food market and to the metro / busses if needed to get around. ",5,2023,05,06
23,Best stay ever 👏👏,"We were on a honeymoon and received the most warm welcome from hotel🥰!

Thanks for the manager Zak who helped carrying our luggages and give us useful tips during our stay, we could spend sweet honeymoon ever. Thank you very much!

We hope that we could stay the hotel and meet people in Holabarcelona again💕.",5,2023,05,04
23,Amazing hotel !,Fantastic hotel with excellent staff who couldn't do enough for us and were incredibly helpful. The rooftop bar and pool is amazing ! The location of the hotel was perfect - right in the middle of Barcelona.,5,2023,05,01
23,Hotel Ohla Barcelona; A Hidden Gem,The service from every single member of staff from the general manger to cleaners and all those in-between was exceptional day and night feeling personal but without being intrusive. The hotel was clean modern homely cosy and pretty much perfect. We would highly recommend this tucked away treasure that is right in the centre of town but feels hidden. They also have a fabulous sauna gym and relaxing area.,5,2023,04,27
23,Best hotel experience ever,"If you’re in Barcelona, you should definitely stay at Ohla Barcelona hotel. The food is wonderful. We ate here for breakfast and dinner/drinks. The food is not only tasty, the presentation is excellent. The breakfast is a mix of buffet and cooked breakfast favorites, which hit the spot no matter what you’re in the mood for. Dinner and drinks are exquisite. Many of Spain’s classics cooked to perfection and paired with great wine (or cocktails of your choice). Also, the rooftop bar is incredibly relaxing. It has spectacular views of the city and ocean making it the ideal place for a drink or dinner. The biggest differentiator, however, is Ohla Barcelona hotel‘s staff. They truly make you feel at home. As an example, I had to work during evenings downstairs (kids were sleeping). I cannot tell you how many times staff brought snacks, water, stopped in to check on me, and took time to ensure I was comfortable. I have never felt more at home. In addition, we were traveling with our 2 and 5 year old sons. They are pros at knowing how to make a scene. Not only did the Ohla Barcelona staff not make us feel uncomfortable, they came in and helped play with the boys to distract them and give us a break. It may not sound significant, but for two exhausted parents having flown 11 hours, this was like magic. I cannot speak highly enough about the Ohla Barcelona hotel. Please stay if you have the chance. This is the only hotel I would consider in Barcelona. You will not be disappointed!! Oh and please say hi to Saúl for us - he is the world’s best hotel manager. 
",5,2023,04,27
23,Caring and clean Hotel,"Beautiful hotel. In the center of Barcelona, walking distance to the Gothic quarter and  the plaza cathedral. The staff are very  attentive. Any requests was done right  away. Zak, one of the concierge staff was the best in making  us feel welcome and was so kind to my 90 yr old mother.  I would definitely recommend this  hotel and look forward to staying with them again ",5,2023,04,22
23,Great location ,"The location if this hotel is very convenient- gothic quarter, placa catalunya everything is close.
Room was clean and tidy. People at the reception were welcoming and helpful. 
Breakfast is decent. 
Overall good experience!",4,2023,04,20
23,OHLA indeed ,"Brilliant experience here. Staff were terrific , we were early as we disembarked from a cruise ship and couldn’t check in , they stored our luggage and we went off exploring. Great location so central to La Rambla, the beach and other monuments . 
Room was spacious . Great rooftop bar, Front desk staff gave great restaurant recommendations , ordered taxis for airport etc and everything was seemless . Really happy and will stay here for sure at our next stop in Barcelona . Total advocates for Hotel Ohla ",5,2023,04,18
23,Rooftop Views and Excellent Service,"This hotel was excellent!  From the warm welcome and excellent check in service to the lovely rooms with comfortable beds and fluffy pillows.  You couldn't ask for better service, nothing was too much trouble.  We had great restaurant recommendations.  The rooftop is a must! with delicious cocktails and an amazing view.  We can't wait to come back!",5,2023,04,18
23,A friendly hotel ideally located in the old city,"Barcelona is for walkers - the lacework of tiny car free lanes are packed with everything from eateries, coffee shops, dogs, pigeons, scooters - you name it. To really enjoy the city you have to be in the old sector - and that is where the Olah Hotel comes into its own. Walk out the front door and you are right in the heart of the action. The first thing you notice about the hotel is how friendly and helpful the front office staff are. As is always the case with Australians, you tend to arrive early - well before normal check-in time. You will be taken to the first floor to finalise formalities - and then probably end up on the rooftop bar sipping complimentary champagne to pass the time away. The standard rooms are medium in size - the glass shower alcove is certainly different but  works well. More USB slots urgently need to be included in the rooms - they are essential these days. I would have 2 slots on each side of the bed and at least one at the desk. Pictured are some of the faces that line the wall in reception. The Olah Hotel likes to be different. Breakfast is excellent by the way - and there is a wine bar by the foyer as well.",4,2023,04,18
23,TOP NOTCH HOTEL- BARCELONA,"First rate hotel in a top location. After very long flight able check in early. Room comfortable, light & quiet. Good quality modern amenities. Breakfast excellent. Plentiful, large range & very good quality. Able to get in early for quick breakfast as early departure for train & able to take a selection of pastries & rolls for trip. All the staff excellent, friendly & helpful.",5,2023,04,16
23,Expensive and not a 5* experience,"My husband booked this hotel as a special treat for my 40th birthday, a rare treat away without our small children.  I had high expectations as it is advertised as a 5* luxury hotel and we paid over 400 euros for 1 night.  The reception and staff on arrival were lovely and welcoming, it certainly felt like we had arrived somewhere special.   

We got to our room to find it was tiny, bland, with very little character and cheap fittings  (lamps, bedside tables, desk, chair).  The room toiletries were basic quality - with sodium lauryl sulphate and other toxins in.  The shower was meant to be a show piece in the room but what it actually meant was half the room was taken up by an unnecessarily large bathroom leaving the bed area of a similar or smaller size. The shower door leaked and flooded the room when we took a shower.  There were multiple wardrobes, all unnecessary as people don't need 3 wardrobes in a hotel.  Investing money to make the bedroom area bigger and more luxurious would have been a much better idea.  I certainly didn't want to spend time in that claustrophobic room.  Also given it was a special occasion and my husband had told the hotel - I did expect perhaps there would be a little acknowledgement of that, like a bottle of cava in the room or a free cocktail at the hotel bar, but no.   

The rooftop pool and bar area was ok but pretty small.  If there were more than 3 people in the pool it would have felt cramped and really it only had space for 2 people to swim.

Breakfast was a buffet style -  basic options like pastries, jamon, cheese, bread, bacon, solid scrambled egg, wet button mushrooms, nothing was cooked to order.  

All in all I felt cheated to have spent that much money on one night there.  There are definitely a lot more central Barcelona hotels with more spacious and pretty rooms and equivalent breakfast classed as 3* or 4* that are much cheaper.  No idea how they gained a 5* accreditation.",2,2023,04,15
23,6/5 Stars!,"Where do we start? We traveled to Barcelona for our Honeymoon and stayed here. From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed and right at home. The staff was incredible. We primarily spoke with Javier, Rafael, and Alvaro who were amazing, but the people with them were fantastic as well. No matter who we saw, they were always willing to help us with anything we needed. The room was always clean and refreshed on a daily basis with service even leaving chocolates for us at the end of the night. Room service breakfast was an 11/10 and would highly recommend. The location of the hotel is perfect as it is right next to a metro line, but we could also pretty much walk anywhere we wanted. If you are looking for a place to stay that values hospitality, than this is it! Enjoy! ",5,2023,04,14
23,Great Ohla Barcelona,"This is such a well located hotel. The room was perfect for a big, busy city stay and the rooftop bar is a must do as the views are great! And there’s a pool! Most of all is the outstanding customer service the team provide - every need met. A special shout out to Zac, Jenny & Alvaro for making us feel so special. Definitely recommend this hotel & will stay here next time we’re visiting family in Barca!",5,2023,04,11
23,"Excellent services, outstanding hotel!","Our staying at Ohla Barcelona was one of our best ever!
The services are excellent, the restaurant is great… and the staff, simply the best! Always helpful and smiling!
For sure Ohla Barcelona will be our first choice when will come back to visit this magnificent city!",5,2023,04,10
23,"Great hotel, great staff","A fascinating hotel in a superb location (gothic quarter, steps from the Aerobus) with a fine breakfast, Michelin star restaurant and chic rooftop bar and pool.   We just had such fun staying here, in a cunningly designed junior suite, enjoying the fun atmosphere in this elegant building. Best of all are the welcoming staff - happy to help, great to communicate with, quick to respond, generous with hospitality, making this a great place to stay in this great city.",5,2023,04,10
23,Exceptional accommodations and service!,"We absolutely loved our stay at Ohla Barcelona.  I can be very critical of accommodations we stay in, but I honestly have nothing bad to say about Ohla Barcelona and I would give it more stars if I could.  To start, the hotel is very beautiful and artistically decorated.  The room was large and the bed was very comfortable.  The location was perfect and very close to everything.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  There were always ready to help us with anything we did, went above and beyond to show us where things were and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  This hotel went above and beyond.  We had a complimentary bottle of cava and box of chocolates in our room when we arrived and on our last night of our stay.  Everyday there was a different chocolate or truffle on left on our pillow when they did turn down service.  They left us notes many of the days that were so sweet as well.  This place is exceptional and I can recommend it without any reservations whatsoever.",5,2023,04,09
23,Perfect for a relaxing weekend in BCN,"Very well located within the Gothic quarter, and just 5' walk from the final station of the airport shuttle. Charming and well furbished and maintained rooms, very friendly service. My choice for future weekend stays in Barcelona. ",5,2023,04,09
23,Ohla was Oohhhh La La,"The hotel is in a vibrant area with lots of shopping and great areas to walk an see the history of the area. The staff was amazing. Our luggage was delayed two days and the offered to help in any way they could. They were always greeting us and asking how we were. Jenny, specifically, went out of her way to help us out.
Highly recommended.",5,2023,04,07
23,Amazing stay in Barcelona,"What an experience! Perfect location. Breakfast was amazing with all you could need including an English breakfast if you want it (scrambled eggs and bacon). Staff were so kind and considerate with advice about where to go, where to eat, anything. Room was quiet and comfortable. The roof top bar is outstanding with unique views over Barcelona.  
Some roadworks while we were there but couldn't hear a thing. I cant recommend this hotel enough. Just go!",5,2023,04,04
23,The stuff of the hotel is very helpful and friendly and the hotel itself is a very comfortable place to stay in Barca,I had a great time at Ohla Hotel. The stuff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was located very central and it was a nice place to be. I would visit Ohla Hotel always again when I am in Barcelona again and I recommend it to everyone visiting Barcelona,5,2023,04,04
23,Felt like home away from home with friends,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Ohla Barcelona Hotel with another couple and it exceeded our expectations. 

The atmosphere felt more hip and modernized. Ohla Hotel is located walking distance from everywhere you want to visit. We felt very safe there knowing that the police headquarters was no less than two blocks away. The staff spoke both Spanish and English which made us feel very comfortable communicating our needs with them. 

We have visited Paris and was expecting a room comparable to that size but was surprised in entering a large room that was spacious for both my wife and me. 

The added breakfast package we purchased was the perfect start to our days. It included an assortment of different eggs, toast, jams, fresh cut fruit, fresh juices, coffee, sausage, bacon, cereals, pastries and my favorite jamon. 

The one thing that makes all my experiences when traveling on vacation much more special is the company. And for Ohla Barcelona, this made my travels compared to anywhere else, my favorite place I’ve visited. The staff was very hospitable and welcoming and although the airline misplaced our luggage, they made every effort in helping us retrieve our belongings. I would like to take the time to give recognition to Jak (bell man) and Jenny (I think, reception) and another gentleman whom I didn’t receive a name (concierge) who went all went above and beyond to ensure our stay was pleasant and enjoyable. 

There is so many great things to say about Ohla Barcelona Hotel! We will definitely be back to visit and maybe when we’re older, stay indefinitely.

23,Perfect hotel in Barcelona,Ohla Barcelona hotel was exceptional. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are modern and perfect size. The staff was amazing. They are super helpful and looking after every detail to ensure your stay is perfect. The restaurants are great. The buffet breakfast has so many options and it’s delicious. I went to Caelis and it was superb. Definitely worth trying. The rooftop is gorgeous with the perfect view of the Cathedral and delicious cocktails. I loved my stay here and will definitely stay again when I come back to Barcelona. The hotel is centrally situated so I was able to walk to many of the attractions and neighborhoods so that is another huge plus. Everything about the hotel is top quality.,5,2023,04,02
23,Outstanding city hotel and great staff,"We had a fabulous stay at Hotel Ohla.  We arrived earlier than  the check in time but that was not a problem for the staff who seemlessly and without fuss allowed us to check in.
We had room 610, a great room, the air con worked well and the room was very clean and quiet. It’s certainly odd to have the shower in the centre of the room but I knew that when we booked.  The roof bar is a bonus for the hotel and does get busy but as a guest you do not have to book, as we left the hotel one evening there we as a queue outside waiting to go up.  The hotel is in a great location and perfect for walking to all areas.
The breakfast was excellent.
A standout member of the team was Zak, one of the concierge team.  He was very professional, informative and helpful and a real asset for the hotel.
We will definitely return.",5,2023,03,28
23,Absolutely wonderful experience thank you to manager down to doorman,"This is a really great little hotel in the center of Barcelona, it is one the nicest hotels I’ve ever stayed at, the staff were exceptional, everyone smiling and welcoming, particularly Sabrina and Amine who went out of there way to help my wife and I.
Very good restaurant and a delightful rooftop bar with fantastic views over the city and an excellent bar menu Absolutely wonderful experience ",5,2023,03,25
23,The best hotel in the gothic quarter,They definitely treat you right! From champagne at checkin to candy at turn down. The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept on- I wish I could have put it in my suitcase!! Everyone is incredibly helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar spectacular and the breakfast buffet yummy!! Definitely a great hotel!,5,2023,03,24
23,A Perfect Stay in Great Location.,"Dates: March 19-22. This is a wonderful hotel. Excellent location with a rooftop patio that is hard to beat for views. Breakfast was excellent with a just about anything one could want. Customer Service was outstanding but perhaps a little ""over the top"" at times. We found just sitting in the lobby waiting for friends drew staff over to ask if we wanted/needed anything. If you have the pleasure to meet Zak, who welcomed us along with the very polite and professional staff you're in good hands. We had a bright corner room with loads of windows. There were very minor things that didn't work for us within the room but that's just personal preference. We were on the second floor and took the stairs daily but did find the lighting to be a bit dark for a winding staircase. I watched others and they were also noticibly cautious. I'd recommend a little extra light which I think could be done in a discreet way. Highly recommend. 100% we'd book again!",5,2023,03,23
23,Not a 5 star hotel,"Having read other reviews I’m wondering if I have spent the last few days in a parallel universe.  The hotel is in a good location on the edge of the gothic quarter on a busy road.  The concierge team were excellent and service was high from them.  Special mention to Jenny who was lovely.  There is a busy rooftop bar that has great views across the city.  Breakfast was good, with a range of options.
We stayed in a corner room which was nice but I never managed to fully fathom the lighting system and neither did my tech savvy daughter.  We must’ve been close to the metro as there was constant train noise, sometimes every 5 minutes which continued through the night.  We were also close to the gym which played music, which is fine but on our last night it went on till 12 and that along with the metro noise was a disturbance.
A lot has been made of the great service.  I personally didn’t feel this with the exception of the concierge team.  One evening I spent £160 on drinks in the rooftop bar and was largely ignored unless I went to the bar or called out to someone as they wandered by.  The breakfast team were pretty unwelcoming too.  We ate one evening in the restaurant and waited ages for a menu and were told this is because so few are printed in English.  
This was my first visit to Barcelona it is a nice city with lots going on.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Marina which is buzzy with lots of restaurants.  I will return but not to The Ohla, probably the Mercer next time.",3,2023,03,20
23,The most wonderful and pleasant stay in Barcelona:) 바르셀로나에서의 감동적인 선물:),"One of my most welcoming and comforting experience during my trip to Spain. All the hotel staff were so nice and friendly. It was our honeymoon and my husband's birthday during the stay, we recieved the most pleasant suprise present which even I did not prepare for him! The rooms were always clean and neat, the breakfast was simple and tasty. We will never forget this experience and look forward to visiting Ohla Barcelona once again! Thank you so much Zak for the warm goodbye:)
호텔 직원분들 모두 너무 친절하고 늘 환영해주셔서 좋았습니다. 신혼여행과 생일 때 따로 샴페인과 초콜렛 그리고 거울에 생일축하 메시지까지 선물로 주시고 감동 받았어요. 방은 늘 깨끗하게 정돈해주시고 첫날에 잠시 외출한 사이에 청소해주실지 모르고 어지럽히고 갔는데 너무 죄송하게도 다 다시 정돈해주었더라구요ㅠ 감동의 연속이었습니다. 조식은 가지 수는 적어도 깔끔하고 정갈합니다. 시내 한 가운데 위치해서 위치도 너무 좋고 다시 바르셀로나에 온다면 꼭 재방문하고 싶은 숙소입니다!",5,2023,03,16
23,Couples city break at Ohla Barcelona,"The central location was amazing to site see and walk around to all main areas of interest/ transport links - the roof top bar is very cool with great views.

The staff are amazingly proactive and considerate - special shout out to Saul (general Mgr) and Havier & Sabrina (front desk) who were fantastically personable and engaging... they are enough of a reason to recommend this hotel!

Breakfast has extended serving till 11.30am! This is great as it allows you to still have some  thing to eat after a late night without having to wake up too early when on holiday. The buffet is very nice - occasional alternation / additions to hot dishes would be a welcome touch.

The hotel boasts a 1-star Michelin restaurant - book ahead if you want to dine there...we tried after checking in but it was booked solid for the days we were there. ",5,2023,03,15
23,Extraordinary staff!,"We had a pleasure of staying at this hotel for three nights, while exploring picturesque Barcelona and it really was a perfect choice. Its location is great, in a short walkable distance from main sightseeing points (Palau de la Música Catalana is literally ‘around the corner’). 
The Ohla Barcelona hotel is stylish (both, outside and in) and the terrace (with a pool!) offers fabulous city views that could be enjoyed with a nice drink in your hand. Our room had everything we needed; it was spotlessly clean and looked after twice a day. The restaurant was great too – lovely décor and ambience, plus attentive staff. Breakfast was plentiful, nicely presented and fresh; and we enjoyed one dinner (smoked eel and beetroot risotto) so much that we opted to ‘stay in’ for the following evening as well. 
One ‘special ingredient’ that takes a word hospitality to another level at this hotel is their staff! All people we met there (Sabrina, Jenny, Amine, Alba, Zak and Mariona, just to mention few) were running everything smoothly with a smile, professionalism and genuine enthusiasm, ALWAYS willing to help with restaurant/tickets booking, offering helpful pieces of advice, ideas and local tips … even thinking ahead what else we might need. 
Thank you, fantastic “Ohla team” - we are now determined to visit Barcelona again and would love to come back to see you! ",5,2023,03,14
23,Perfect location. Superb service.,"1. We found this hotel to be located perfectly. Easy walking distance to meeting places for all tours and most of the sights to visit, and loads of great places to eat and drink nearby. 
2. When we arrived, the welcome received was outstanding. Smiling faces, hot towels, glasses of cava, all delivered at the same time as a slick booking-in procedure.
3. Concierge desk staff were always smiling and very helpful. Particular thanks to Rafael who was lovely throughout our stay. 
4. Good breakfast buffet in a nice setting. 
5. Lovely cocktails and tapas options to be had on the rooftop terrace. No queueing for residents as well!
6. Our room (206) was spacious, spotlessly clean, comfortable, very nice bed and pillows.

We will return to Barcelona, what a city! And when we do we will stay at the Ohla.",5,2023,03,07
23,Very recommended hotel 🏨 ,"The hotel is lovely, the food is very tasty, and the location is excellent.  And the team!!  We have never met a team so amazing, the personal treatment and care.  We will definitely be back again!  Thank you very much for enriching our experience!",5,2023,03,04
23,Best stay ever.,"We were here for business and vacation. From the Moment we checked in to the moment we checked out the service was impeccable. I have never been treated by a hotel as if we are the only customers. Our bags didn’t arrive when we did and they helped show us where to purchase things until our bags came. They also greeted us with a bottle of cava, and it was my husband‘s birthday while we were there and they brought him a piece of cake and balloons And a card and a bottle of Cava. From arranging taxis, restaurant reservations, tour suggestions and registration, as well as spa treatments, it could not have been a better stay. We will definitely be back. The staff is amazing.",5,2023,03,04

23,Short visit,"We had a wonderful stay at Ohla Barcelona. The staff were excellent, always welcoming, helpful and courteous, especially Zak. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. Breakfast was of the highest standard with a variety of food and dishes for all tastes. The hotel was very convenient for all the attractions, metro and bus from the airport.

Hotel has roof-deck lounge which is great too.
Breakfast is totally great start of the day. Varsity of choices and fresh food.
Thank you staff of ohla Barcelona",5,2023,02,18
23,Impeccable service in the heart of Barcelona!,"The biggest stand out of the hotel is it’s staff. The service we received was fantastic and one of the best we have encountered. 
The hotel itself is well designed and stylish. On arrival, we were offered refreshments including, sparkling wine and the staff really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. 
We stayed in a junior suite which was very spacious and bright. We noticed the window was not closing on the first evening and the noise from the street kept us awake. However, once made aware, the hotel fixed the problem immediately and without any delay. 
The breakfast was plentiful and had lots of fresh fruit on offer. 
A big shout out to Javier and Rafael, who were always smiling and welcoming on the front desk. Javier remembered us by name and tried hard to pronounce our Scottish surname when welcoming us each day. 
Overall, we had a beautiful stay in sunny Barcelona and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the wonderful city. 
Also, the rooftop bar is a must with its sweeping views across the city.",5,2023,02,14
23,Magical hotel and amazing staff,"We travel a lot and never write reviews for hotels - the exception is Ohla Barcelona because the experience was just fantastic. The staff go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and share their insider tips for great restaurants/experiences. The location is superb - so central and yet remarkably quiet in the rooms. Roof top bar is great - a bit chilly, but amazing views and a great place to have a cocktail after walking around the city. Only slight downside was the bed, which was a bit firm for us, but that aside I cannot fault the hotel. Thanks to the amazing team for making our stay so memorable. ",5,2023,02,14
23,Great spot to explore Barcelona from,Ohla was a lovely base from which to see Barcelona.  Well located and lovely staff.  Comfortable room although a shower in the middle of the room was niche.

This meant I had a pleasant and stress-free trip, doing everything I wanted to do and visiting some of the best restaurants in the city. The location was ideal too, everything was within walking distance and the views from the hotel were striking. ",5,2023,02,12
23,Amazing hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon and wow what a lovely hotel. Can’t recommend it enough. Every member of staff could not have been more friendly and helpful, the room was lovely and the breakfast was great. The location is central. In addition the roof top bar is very good, and again the staff there were lovely",5,2023,02,10
23,Ohla hotel Barcelona,"Well what can we say, from the time we arrived to when we left it was first class, this hotel isn't 5 star for nothing, I have been to many hotels on my travels and this was one of the best, super clean, super friendly and helpful, breakfast was top quality foods as well as eco friendly quality amenities in the room and the whole of the hotel decor was.all to my taste!!
You are offered to have your sheets changed on a daily basis along with two housekeeping visits one in the morning and one in the evening making your bed fresh again after an afternoon siesta, with clean towels and some complimentary chocolates left on your pillow ready for when you arrive back after your evening meal. WOW!! 

I also had a massage in the spa which was amazing from Daniell!!! 

The only downside for us is there is no separate bar area from the restaurant to have a drink only a rooftop.bar which is stunning but only when the weather is nice however we would still highly recommend this hotel and will be staying again when we return one day to Barcelona. 

Thank you to all the staff for making our city break fantastic.",5,2023,02,09
23,The perfect example of customer experience excellence  ,"One of the best hotel experience I ever had, for sure will come again. the warm welcoming from the staff was very noticed, the hotel location as well was amazing.

23,Lovely hotel AMAZING staff,"Let me be clear I NEVER write reviews, but I had such a lovely experience at the hotel that I feel I must. My husband and I have just spent two nights at the hotel. As soon as you arrive you are met with friendly faces, staff who go out of their way to help. As you check in you are offered a glass of cava or a non alcoholic drink, whilst we were checking in we just happened to mention that we were going to the Michael Buble concert the following night. The hotel is centrally located in the gothic area, easy walking distance to Las Ramblas and a quick metro ride to the other attractions. On the day of the concert we returned to the hotel to freshen up before making our way to the concert and we were amazed to find a bottle of champagne with a postcard of Michael Buble and the words to one of his songs written on the mirror. I am only sorry we didn’t get to go a meet Fam, who is also the resident MB. I was amazed, they didn’t have to do this but they went out of their way, how often does that happen? The rooftop bar is a must, lovely atmosphere and views. Beds are comfortable, the glass shower probably isn’t great if you are sharing with a friend but my husband and I found it to be a novelty! The thing that makes this hotel is the staff, all fabulous and all happy to provide good recommendations. Javier suggested we go to a restaurant at the local, smaller, market, a five minute walk from the hotel, it was excellent. Try Luigis, it is a 30 sec walk from the hotel. All in all this is a lovely boutique hotel with the personal touch. I would strongly recommend it to anyone. Thank you sooooo much to the staff for really making our stay special. I have stayed at many top hotels around the world and very few have managed to make me feel special, both my husband and I would definitely go back ",5,2023,02,02

The hotels service is amazing & also the food is great. It’s extremely clean, aesthetically pleasing to look at and overall a beautiful hotel. My boyfriend upgraded the room prior to staying there, and we were treated by the staff with a bottle of fizz and chocolates with a little note from the manager. This was incredibly lovely and extremely thoughtful. I hardly ever take the time to write feedback regarding my trips etc but this was definitely something i needed to share. 

I will definitely be booking another trip to Barcelona in the year and will 100% plan to stay at this hotel without a doubt.",5,2023,01,19
23,Amazing Hotel!!!!,"This is one of the best hotels I have ever been to. Our room was absolutely immaculate, and every night a different kind of chocolate was left on our pillows, the hotel has many small touches that make the guests feel very special. Everybody at the front desk went above and beyond to help us with restaurant recommendations, and anything else we needed. The rooftop Bar is gorgeous, and the drinks were delicious. I loved the fact that we were close to everything, but our room was extremely quiet. I would not stay anywhere else if I was visiting Barcelona!",5,2023,01,12
23,many problems…,"The hotel is  not 5 star standard. I have spent a week here. On no day was the room cleaned before 5pm, some days even later. So the room is not useable when you come back to the hotel in the afternoon. I had to go without housekeeping at times because I had to get ready for appointments in the evening and didn't have time to wait for the maid. 

The fact that I reported the problem to the front desk on the first day had no effect. 

For breakfast, guests have to prepare their own capsule coffee, hard boiled eggs and toast. The powdered scrambled eggs are not an enticing alternative. 

On the plus side: There are many coffeeshops in the area with excellent coffee and some decent bites for breakfast.

Overall, an unfavorable price-performance ratio and a low Service-Level imho.",2,2023,01,11
23,Excellent place,"Excellent location, super nice employees and fine dining was superb! It's probably the best location for sightseeing and shopping, bars and restaurants. You can take a nap in the afternoon and continue refreshed in the evening.",5,2023,01,11
23,Perfect location and remarkable service,"The hotel is super nice and the employees really care about their guests. They made it a very special experience. The rooms are really nice, too and the rooftop bar is so beautiful just to hang out or work or get some drinks. 
The breakfast was lovely and had everything one could ask for.
We used the parking of the hotel for our car and it was very convenient. 
Also, the location of the hotel is perfect. You only have to walk down one street to either get to the famous Rambla to shop or to go the harbour or beach.
We will definitely come back for a longer stay at the ohla! ",5,2023,01,09
23,Easily the finest hotel stay of our lifetimes !,"The Ohla Barcelona was the best of the best of the best, from 1st greeting to our departure 5 days later.  Ms. Iraia -- and in fact everyone on the team -- were unbelievably friendly, accommodating and extraordinarily helpful.  The facilities were spotless, modern and VERY convenient, and the included breakfast was superb. Service 'above and beyond' was the watchword every single day.  We do not say this lightly--this was the most enjoyable hotel experience we have had in our loooong lifetimes.  Cannot wait to come back !  Thank you so much.",5,2023,01,02
23,One word….. Amazing,"Talk about getting the Royal treatment! I was greeted with friendly faces the moment I arrived, champagne, desserts and an overview of all the amenities. What I loved the most about this place was the top notch customer service and the location. You are right in the gothic quarter and nearly walking distance to all the tourist attractions. As a solo traveler I always try and find places to stay that make me feel safe and I definitely got this feeling. Definitely coming back con las familia!",5,2023,01,02

We were greeted outside by the bellman with a cart for our luggage and check in was simple and we were offered glasses of Cava. The rooms were clean, modern, and exactly how we asked for them. The breakfast was excellent and everyday we were surprised with something in our room— a bottle of cava, fruit, and postcards. Nighttime turndown service was a nice touch as well. We never wanted you anything.

The location is also perfect- in between el born, las ramblas, and close to the metro. We walked to many attractions like the Picasso museum and the boqueria market and it was an easy metro ride to montjuic and sagrada familia.

Would absolutely recommend and would stay again. Thank you to the team at the Ohla for a really excellent stay!",5,2022,12,15
23,A birthday to remember,"This was a birthday surprise for my girlfriend and the hotel and staff did not disappoint. I contacted the hotel in advance who provided a brilliant birthday package comprising cake, balloons, CAVA and lovely messages on the mirrors. The staff couldn’t have been more welcoming and courteous. The location was excellent with easy access to the marina/waterside, Las Rambla and Central Barcelona.

Looking forward to our return.",5,2022,12,11
23,Superb in every way,"My wife and I were bowled over by our 4 night stay at Ohla Barcelona: it was a joy from start to finish. The staff, every one of them, went out  of their way to make our stay a pleasure. We look forward to returning as soon as we can. And all this is aside from the hotel's convenient location for exploring the city's historic centre and all its attractions. Thank you!",5,2022,12,09
23,Wonderful Weekend Stay,"A large group of friends all descended on Barcelona for a weekend to celebrate our friends birthday and stayed with Ohla Barcelona.  From start to finish we had a fabulous experience.  The hotel itself is located very centrally and is easy walking distance to all sights, shops and restaurants.  
We had breakfast included in our stay and it was truly delicious - the omelettes were a particular fave with us all.  
The rooms are small but have everything you need and the beds are very comfortable.  
My only small criticism would be the odd set up of the glass shower which is in the middle of the room and very exposed.  Obviously travelling in a couple is fine but it is nice to have some privacy!!!   Friends who were sharing had to either change rooms or leave the room when showering.  Not convenient so worth checking if you are sharing with friends!!  Overall a fab experience and would most definitely stay again",5,2022,12,06
23,Hidden gem!,Lovely hotel perfectly located for our trip. Lovely staff and hospitality. Rooms are quirky and modern. Restaurant was fabulous. Would definitely return. Highly recommend. We walked everywhere and soaked up all the sights. Thank you. 😊 ,5,2022,12,03
23,Excellent hotel and staff!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Ohla for a week, and had an amazing experience! The hotel is centrally located and in easy walking distance to all the main attractions of the city. We had the breakfast buffet included with our room, and it was a great way to start the day. The staff were exceptional, going out of their way to make our stay the best possible. They gave great restaurant recommendations, and booked our reservations that included special service as a hotel guest of Ohla. We had a medical emergency come up during the trip and the staff was accommodating in every way possible, which made the process a lot easier to manage. The roof top bar was closed for maintenance during most of our stay, but we got to enjoy it on the first day and were really impressed by the views and atmosphere. The beds are exceptionally comfortable. Overall we would definitely stay here again and can't recommend Ohla enough! Special thanks to Sabrina, Juan Marc, Zak, and Baba!",5,2022,11,30
23,First visit to city. Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel. Staff really friendly and can’t do enough to help. The only downside was the vibration from the metro in our room during the night. I am a light sleeper so this disturbed me most of the fri/sat night. We were on the 1st floor. Don’t know if this makes a difference,5,2022,11,27
23,Incredible hotel in central location of Barcelona!!,"What sets Ohla apart from any other hotel is their staff!!! Everyone went above and beyond. They showed extraordinary attention to detail, went the extra mile, took the extra care to make our stay even more rewarding and meaningful. They surprised us a couple of times with unexpected (treats) and really helped us to make the most of our stay. Hotel is very clean and modern. Beautiful rooftop bar/pool. SO convenient to everything - can walk everywhere or walk within minutes to Catalunya station. The Experience Desk folks welcomed us every morning and said goodnight every night. You really felt they took the time to know their guests, their names, where they’re from, etc. ",5,2022,11,24
23,A wonderful gem of a hotel in the Gotic / El Born area,"I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel. I loved the location (it was close to everything - major sights, the metro, Gotic Quarter, great restaurants) and the room was large and had chic modern decor. What puts this hotel above and beyond is the staff and their attention to your comfort and joy - I don’t want to give any spoilers about the gestures the staff will make because they are genuinely lovely surprises and should be experienced - but WOW - my partner and I were blown away by this place. I would stay in Ohla every time I am in Barcelona - keep up the good work!",5,2022,11,23
23,An amazing hotel in a wonderful city,"Arriving in this 5 star boutique hotel one gets the feeling that this really could be a 5 star stay and not just a hotel with stars due to its having hairdryers etc.
The experience (concierge) staff greets you and ushers you into the reception area where you are greeted, seemed and treated to cava, or other drinks while guided through your check in.
The room, a corner junior suite in our case, was perfectly appointed and fulfilled our expectations 100%.
Breakfast was perfect and as always the staff was a dream.
We unfortunately were not able to enjoy the in house Michelin restaurant but we will the next time. The other amenities such as pool, bar, gym were also all wonderful.
The hotels central location in the gothic quarter makes it a perfect central location from which to explore the vibrant city",5,2022,11,16
23,Worthy of its 5 stars!,"Absolutely loved our stay at Ohla Hotel, we stayed in a few different hotels looking for one we would like to stay in next year for a special occasion.
The staff were unbelievably helpful and very attentive from the moment we stepped in the door. (Honestly couldn’t fault the service!)
Room was very impressive, clean and finished to a very high standard
There are 3 restaurants to choose from all offering something different.
Location was great, within walking distance to most attractions.
We had a great time and are now seriously considering this for our special trip next year!",5,2022,11,16
23,Great hotel in a good area of Barcelona,"Customer service is outstanding!  Everyone on the team was very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is in a great area to explore the Gothic section, walk to Barceloneta or El Born.  The hotel is very clean, has a nice small gym and although we didn't have a chance to go the restaurant looked very good.  We did enjoy the roof top bar too.

Be aware of the shower it is full glass and viewable throughout the room.  We knew this ahead of time and managed fine.",5,2022,11,08
23,Well located hotel,Very well located hotel with extrem friendly staff. The room is very nice and the  breakfast has a good Selektion of good food. The only very little minus is the bad organization of the breakfast waiters/waitresses and that no egg Bendedict was available.,5,2022,11,06
23,Great hotel but not much sleep due to noise at night,"Recently returned from a 4 night family break staying in adjoining rooms at this hotel. Rooms were very spacious and comfortable, we had made a request for rooms in a quiet area of the hotel as had previously read reviews about the noise outside, unfortunately our rooms even though on the 5th floor were incredibly noisy at night, a combination of road works and bin collection every night made it very difficult to sleep. When I discussed this with a member of the Reception Team I was told there was no work going on outside! The hotel is in a great location we walked to many places day and night. The roof top bar is a fabulous setting with a great team. The team at the Experience Desk is what makes this hotel though, big thanks to Zak and Javier for making the kids Birthday special, and suggesting brilliant restaurants. Unfortunately we came across a couple of very unfriendly, rude staff at the La Plassohla restaurant (within the hotel) when having breakfast and dinner, the restaurant seemed short staffed at times making those staff very stressed and clearly not happy. I also mentioned this at Reception as it did spoil a couple of meals but was told that the restaurant was separate from the hotel. I would recommend this hotel but I would be worried about the noise at night.",4,2022,11,01
23,Outstanding customer service,"We just had a 2 night stay but a wonderful experience. Every member of staff was so lovely. The Experience desk was outstanding. Sorting taxis, museum tickets and restaurant bookings - just brilliant. 
Our room was small but absolutely fine for a short stay. Immaculately clean and everything worked. Thank you!",5,2022,10,30
23,Outstanding hotel,Very nice rooms and common areas.  Staff were attentive and very helpful.   Location is excellent.  It is walking distance to a lot of attractions and to the subway.  This is one of the nicest hotels in which we have stayed.,5,2022,10,28
23,Will definitely comeback!,"Excellent customer service! The staff made everyone feel welcome and special.
Location was perfect in the heart of Barcelona, close to all that we wanted to visit, but far enough from the chaos. Very good amenities and close to restaurants and shopping areas. 
Breakfast was the perfect, room was clean and comfortable, will definitely come back and stay in this location again, I’ll most definitely recommend this place to my family and friends.",5,2022,10,27
23,OHLA Barcelona,"A 10 star Boutique Hotel, starting from location ,services,accommodation and anything that you want the person at front desk will impact your visit THEY ARE THE TOP 10 in customer services.we do recommend this beautiful HOTEL to anyone who decide to travel BARCELONA    I do appreciate the Managment of the hotel for the excellent and exceptional service this trip was the time of my life 
Very happy with my days at the OHLA Barcelona hotel",5,2022,10,27
23,Perfecto!!!!,"From the moment we checked in to when we checked out the staff made us feel fantastic and valued!!!

Jenny and her colleagues were fantastic in ensuring that we had a fantastic stay- how could you not with such a great location, stylish hotel and super friendly and helpful staff! 

When it came to local knowledge and assistance the staff were extremely helpful in pointing us in the right direction, booking tour and dinner reservations, and most importantly steering us away from tourist traps and not so important areas of town.

The room we stayed in was incredible and spacious and just what we needed. The shower in the center of the room just adds to the edginess of the entire stay.

To top it off- the staff remembered it was our anniversary and surprised us with an amazing note and very chilled bottle of Cava!

Above and beyond of what we expected from the staff- and based on that I would recommend anyone to stay there.",5,2022,10,26
23,"Beautiful hotel, Great Location","From the second we walked into the lobby I knew we were going to enjoy our stay here.  We were greated by the front desk receptionist who took our luggage and escorted us upstairs to a private check in room.  Check in was easy and quick, they also offer to help you set up dinner reservations, tours .. etc.. anything you need they are there to help.  We booked the Junior Deluxe suite and it was amaizing , spacious clean, modern and a great view from all directions. we were welcomed to our room with a bottle of champage and chocolates. 

Everything about this hotel was amaizing but the one thing( person) who made our stay here so memorable  was cesar at the steak house located in the hotel. We got in late the first night and stopped in here for dinner , at first i was a little skeptical because the menu is very small and only has to varieties of steak cuts but cesar reasured me I would love the steak so we went by his recomendations and it was indeed one of the best steaks Ive eaten in my life. We returned everyday after that just to say hi and have a drink he is an amaizing mixologist and made us some of the best drinks we've ever had, not to mention he also has great conversation. THANK YOU CESAR you truly made our trip!",5,2022,10,23
23,Fantastic Location & Service,"We stayed at Ohla Barcelona for 3 days at the end of our 18 day tour.  It was lovely to have such a warm greeting upon arrival at the hotel.  The service didn't stop there the experience desk was helpful for us a few times.  The breakfast was great in the mornings to kick start your day and you had a choice of rooftop bar or main level bar to wrap up your busy day.  
We found restaurants right on the walking streets beside the hotel and the proximity to the Rambla was perfect a short walk but far enough from the busy chaos. We will stay here again when in Barcelona.",5,2022,10,21
23,Our 5 day stay at this superb hotel,"Like previous guests we cannot wait to return to the Ohla and we felt it was certainly worth their 5 star rating. Our essential room was most certainly large enough with a king size bed. Well equipped with 2 comfy chairs, tv, wifi, welcome cava, tea coffee etc and excellent power shower and accessories. We loved the breakfast room and the selection of food was most inviting. There WAS plenty of fresh orange juice during our stay and the breakfast staff were most attentive at all times. The rooftop pool, especially at night was a WOW with wonderful views! Most of all, all the staff and especially those at reception went overboard to help us. They even surprised us with a delightful anniversary card, cava and choccies left in our room. We fell in love with them and lots of hugs and wet eyes when we left. We just hope to return as soon as possible.",5,2022,10,18
23,"Ohla Barcelona - Disappointing, not up to 5 star standard","Not 5 star. Very disappointing stay for 4 nights.  Reviews looked amazing, but not what we experienced. Design rooms are small n not up to standard, curtains in our room were hanging off the hooks onto the ground.  Breakfast was a joke, very poor, n if you dont mind waiting to cook your eggs or toast for 10 mins. Two people I saw thought the eggs were cooked and wore it when they cut the top off.  No orange juice the first morning and asked again after 40 mins and still nothing. Ground level staff are amazing and rooftop, but reception person were cold and unwelcoming.  The rooftop area which is nice with the pool is open to the public after 7pm, so if you are there you could be asked to move, not what you expect as a paying guest.   After spending 4 weeks in Portugal and Spain in 5 star hotels, this hotel did not live up to the hype.  ",3,2022,10,16
23,Barca Trip October 2022,"Had a fantastic stay. The staff were lovely, very attentive and helpful. Location was brilliant and the rooftop pool was just amazing. Very clean rooms, a great shower and comfy beds. Will defiantly stay here again if I went back to Barcelona . Couldn't have asked more from the hotel, it made for a great holiday",5,2022,10,13
23,Feeling like Home,"Always the best. 
I stayed at least 20 times in Ohla and its always like coming home.
The whole team tries to give there best and they do. 
The rooms are spacious and clean. The rooftop is wonderful. 
But the best in the Hotel are the people who gives you the feeling as you are a familiy member.
Thanks to the Team.
I will come back definitely next Year 
",5,2022,10,09
23,Fabulous stay in Barcelona,We were so happy with this hotel.  The location was great and the staff were amazing!!!  They were so friendly and helpful.  Very refreshing to have such great service.  We also loved the rooftop bar.  Fun and cool place to enjoy the beautiful Barcelona views.  I would highly recommend staying at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona!,5,2022,10,06
23,Must visit,"Amazing hotel to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. 
Beautiful hotel, room and roof terrace.
Amazing location in gothic quarter with so many amazing alleys, cathedrals, sites, shops and bars / cafes on your doorstep.
Friendly and very attentive staff.
Very clean and quiet.
Very keen to visit again as soon as time allows.
Thank you.",5,2022,10,05
23,Boutique hotel with excellent service and staff friendliness.,"From the central location with walking distance to all that's great to the welcoming and friendly staff, we loved this hotel. We liked it so much that we checked some bags for a few days and went to Ibiza and then returned to Ohla for another stay. The rooftop vibe is wonderful, the rooms are fantastic, and the daily breakfast is excellent.",5,2022,10,03
23,Hola Ohla!!,"Overall the service was outstanding.  Caelis was superb.  Check-in staff, bellboys, and concierge went above and beyond to ensure our stay was fantastic.  A special recognition for Javier with concierge who was fantastic with answering all of my questions and making dinner reservations. Likewise, I’d like to recognize the fantastic bartender at Monsieur Rouge who made the best Negroni cocktails and was warm and welcoming.  This was our first Ohla experience and certainly not our last.  Thank you for the wonderful experience!",5,2022,10,02
23,Good spot for staying in Barcelona!,"Nice hotel in a great spot in the old town. Close to lots of attractions and restaurants. Staff was great, particularly the concierge who had great recommendations for eating.  Also the gentleman who assisted with our luggage - very friendly. Rooms were comfortable and decent size.",5,2022,10,01
23,First-class hotel in perfect location,"The hotel staff was wonderful - gracious, friendly and helpful. We were able to easily get around the whole city from this ideal central location. Easily walkable to a million bars and restaurants in the gothic quarter, as well as the metro station for access to all the sites you want to see throughout the city. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend. Thanks so much for making our first visit to Barcelona such a fantastic experience!",5,2022,09,29
23,Pre and post Cruise stay,"From the initial emails exchanged with Javier to the huge smile and and amazing service of Zach, as well as all the rest of the staff, our Honeymoon cruise couldn’t have started out better. 

On a scale of 1 to 10 this place was an 11. 

From its perfect location to the beautiful roof top pool area, this is the place to stay when you visit Barcelona. 

Their attention to detail made our stay and city visit effortless!",5,2022,09,29
23,Perfect hotel in lovely Barcelona!,"Perfect hotel experience in lovely Barcelona! Well located just north of Gothic Quarter, 5 minutes from Las Ramblas. City bus access right outside front door, subway access 5 minutes away. Incredibly helpful staff and Experience Desk - just super service and wonderful people. We felt very welcome and taken care of. Hotel will organize transport from the airport, day trips, car transport for longer exploring, museum tickets, etc. Room was excellent - Deluxe Double room - lots of space, good lighting, bed was a little harder than we are used to. Food/restaurant excellent - full breakfast with lots of options. Roof top bar excellent!  Such a perfect spot to watch the sunset at the end of a long day. Loved our stay.",5,2022,09,28
23,Ohla Amazing Hotel,"We had a wonderfull time in the Ohla Hotel. First we went to a cruise, second destination Ohla Hotel Barcelona for 3 days. Lovely welcome, super friendly staff, perfect breakfast and restaurant, wonderfull bedroom.",5,2022,09,27
23,Stayed before heading out on a cruise,"The room was wonderful.  Clean, new and what a view, and right in the middle of all the wonderful things that make the Gothic Quarter so fun!  Staff was amazing, very helpful, and the included breakfast was the icing on the cake.  When we come back to Barcelona, we will definitely stay here again.  Only bummer was the rooftop pool was closed due to lightning....no fault of the hotel, just didn't work out for us.  My cousin and his wife chose a different hotel (that was more expensive) and when they came to see ours, they were mad they didn't stay at Ohla!",5,2022,09,26
23,Perfect balance ,"Absolutely faultless. Perfect location, extremely efficient and polite staff, fantastic restaurant, good breakfast and lovely rooms. Popular rooftop bar but also a very nice ground floor bar. It's a lovely hotel but the staff made it for me as in every staff member from the cleaners to management were all extremely polite and very officiant.",5,2022,09,26
23,Ohla Hotel in Barcelona,"The beauty of this boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic Center in Barcelona is only outmatched by its hospitality. The four of us who stayed found the staff of the Ohla, especially our porter Rafael, to be beyond helpful and welcoming. From the moment we checked in, we felt like VIP's. The art, inside and out, was a feast for the eyes and the rooftop became our favorite hangout.
Anytime we visit Barcelona in the future, the Ohla Hotel will definitely be our choice.",5,2022,09,25
23,Ohla Barcelona,"This hotel was one of the most amazing hotels I have stayed at. From the staff being so helpful and lovely to, the decor and room that we stayed in. I stayed for my birthday, my sister booked it and I wasn’t expecting much but honestly she outdid herself. I would say that the hotel is more on the pricer side, however if you are looking to go to Barcelona and have a higher budget, then I would definitely recommend. It was my birthday while we were there and the staff sent a bottle of wine to our room, a little cake with a candle and wrote a card for me, which I thought was so thoughtful. The smallest of details really do make a difference in your stay. Ohla is located in gothic quarter, everything is very near by. The shops, restaurants, supermarkets, cute little cafes etc. so overall a 5 star review from me.",5,2022,09,24
23,"great location, great hotel","we were there for three days, hotel location is very close to airport bus drop of in the gothic quarter
hotel staff were very friendly, excellent room service, very good WIFI connection and reasonable breakfast
must try the roof bar, great views and excellent ""sangria""",5,2022,09,17
23,Amazing stay!,"Great hotel! Perfect location, lovely staff, comfy beds, super stylish rooms. LOVED it! Would 100% stay here again.

The only negative thing I can say is that the rooftop is slightly overrated and too busy. But everybody else seemed to love it!",5,2022,09,15
23,Exceptional customer service.,"We stayed at OhLa Barcelona in July 2022 and cannot stress the marvelous customer service we received.  After traveling for 10+ hours it was so comforting to arrive with such professional employees.  Thank you Juanma, Eduardo and Rafa at check in/concierge your service. The rooms were very clean upon arrival and the thoughtful welcoming gift was a nice touch. The buffet breakfast was delicious.  The best part is the location, it is so close to all the gothic places to visit, the Cathedral, coffee/pastry shops. We really enjoyed our stay at OhLa Barcelona.",5,2022,09,13
23,Amazing Hotel,"Beautiful hotel and fabulous location. Excellent service from Staff. Zak especially went the extra mile, at the start and end of our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Barcelona. The room was beautiful, we were upgraded on our arrival to the deluxe room, which was a wonderful surprise and absolutely had the wow factor",5,2022,09,12
23,Wow!!,Most beautiful hotel. From start to finish we were welcomed and looked after unlike any other hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Staff were so friendly and helpful at all times. Perfect location. Plenty of shops and restaurants around. Wouldn’t stay at any other hotel now we’ve stayed here.,5,2022,09,11
23,3 nights in Barcelona,"From the airport to the reception our stay at Ohla was excellent with the package we chose we were greeted with cava, warm smiles and attentive staff taking our bags to our room which was prepared before signing papers. 
Before going to our room we decided to check out the popular rooftop, which lives up to the hype. The views are immaculate with guests enjoying the pool. My husband and I enjoyed our room very much which came with a bath tub and corner views of Barcelona.
Ohla is located centrally with many activities in walking distance. 
Tons of bars, cafes and restaurants to enjoy at your pleasure.
The hotel restaurant Caelis is a fabulous experience itself, one we will never forget. We highly suggest to book a table during your stay. 
Enjoy the photos, they will speak for themselves.",5,2022,09,08
23,AMAZING,"This is our first time in Barcelona and I am so incredibly happy we stayed here. The staff was so amazing and so helpful. They helped us with places to eat, what to see and anything else we needed help with. The location is absolutely perfect. You can walk anywhere, bars, restaurants, sights and the beach is even within walking distance ! The rooms are beautiful, very clean, our view was beautiful and the amenities were great.  Also, the restaurant in the hotel has great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And the rooftop bar is beautiful and great drinks. I would tell anyone that wants to go to Barcelona to stay here.",5,2022,09,03
23,Great,Great hotel. Beautiful and upscale. Great service and perfect location. Staff very friendly and very helpful. Room was spacious and beautiful. Very nice rooftop pool. Included breakfast was a big plus.,5,2022,08,28
23,Great hotel with rooftop bar and pool in the centre of Barcelona,"All staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. Great location, very nice rooftop terrace with service and a bar, and a nice little pool to cool off in. There’s a gym and spa that you can use after check-out time. Recommend this place 10/10 for a trip to Barcelona. The breakfast is buffet style, pretty complete, and included in my room rate.",5,2022,08,28
23,"Great hotel, awesome service!","The Ohla Barcelona is located in the Barri Gotico, in the center of Barcelona. Beautiful alleys and Bus/Metro right in front of the hotel, 5 minutes walk to the Cathedral, 10 minutes to the harbour, maybe 20 to the beach.
I loved the balance of design and still feeling cozy somehow. Clean modern rooms, with adjustable invisible AC, comfortable bed, big closet with personal safe, Coffee machine capsules and water bottles always refilled (free).
The service was outstanding! Room Service twice a day, the Concierge/Experience desk employees, were welcoming, helpful, and gave great advices on sights, food, transport, organised reservations or whatever was needed.
The breakfast buffet offered options for every taste I'd say, a bit of English breakfast, Muffins, different breads, various bread spreads, cooked eggs, scrambled eggs, Spanish cheeses, Iberico ham etc. Gorgeous!",5,2022,08,22
23,Great Location!,"The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The classy ""boutique"" hotel was in an excellent location and within walking distance of a lot of attractions. The beds were very comfortable and property clean. I would definitely stay again if I go back to Barcelone.",5,2022,08,18
23,Still excellent,"We’ve stayed here several times before lockdown and also the Ohla Eixample   

I still very much give it 5 and recommend it. 

Breakfast is running. Location is amazing. And the rooms are lovely. Staff are good

My only gripe this time was check in

My memories of checking in both here and Ohla Eixample are of smiley people offering you water and cava and making you feel like your journey was worth it. 

This time we must have caught someone on the end of a long shift. No smiles no cava no water.  Although we did find some in reception we helped ourself to. 

Nevertheless I still recommend it. 
I hope her day improved. Ours did",5,2022,08,18
23,One night was not enough!,"From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly and with great enthusiasm from the front desk staff, who went out of their way to help us. Our check in was smooth despite arriving early from an overnight flight. They were able to store our bags and gave us options to shower at the gym.  The room was spacious and well appointed and they happily arranged our rides whenever needed. A terrific experience from start 
 to finish!",5,2022,08,18
23,Fantastic Hotel with amazing staff,"As a group of 8 of us were visiting Barcelona from several countries we spent a long time researching the right hotel and we were so glad we did! Every one of our group loved our 3 night stay and cannot wait to return. The location is spot on, right in the heart of things, yet you would never know once you are in the quiet and luxurious comfort of your room. Beds super comfy, bathroom interesting, but not a deal breaker as we had the essential rooms which meant a little more privacy in the shower! The roof top terrace was amazing and such a great little space to chill out! The minute we walked through the door, staff could not do enough for us and this was true throughout our stay. A special shoutout to the amazing barman in the downstairs bar that served us with a smile each evening when we returned! He is a great character and made great late night cocktails! A little more staff training in the restaurant on food allergies and preferences would be helpful as our only issue was staff not helping when we asked about dairy free food for one of our group (I had stated her allergy on the booking) and what was vegan for another. Although there was oat milk and soy milk available in the fridge which was great. Overall though we had a truly amazing stay, facilities, location and staff all fantastic.",5,2022,08,17
23,Difficult to top!,"This short trip with my friend was totally worth the money. We both didn't want to leave the cosy bed in the morning but when we did, everything we wanted to do (sightseeing, eating, shopping, beach) was right around the corner or in the not so far walking distance. From the moment we set foot in the hotel right until the day we left everything - especially the lovely, sweet and very considerate service from staff - has been nothing but wonderful. They also surprised my friend who's birthday was a month ago with balloons, cake and champagne! The only thing I could think of to improve is concerning the fresh fruits for breakfast which didn't look so appealing because there were many flies. But overall - if you need a place to stay I strongly! recommend you the Hotel Ohla Barcelona.",5,2022,08,16
23,Hilarious!,"Hilarious. No bidet, wash basins too high, transparent shower between bed and basins. Not sexy. Stairwell so dark as to be a health and safety issue. No light to speak of illuminating lift buttons, was advised by staff to use the light on my phone to see. Concierge, when asked for the location of a good Japanese restaurant said she didn’t know because she did not like Japanese food. Rooftop pool was so murky that swimmers would appear out of the gloom like the creature from the black lagoon, didn't smell to good either. On checkout I was told by the receptionist that the owner must have bribed the building controller to get the more dangerous “design” features permission and agreed that this was probably how they got the five star rating too. Good hotel for a very expensive laugh.",2,2022,08,15
23,Perfect location,What a charming hotel in the Gothic Quarter. Easy to walk to everything. Great breakfast included with everything you could want. The only drawback to our room was the bathroom/shower offer no privacy. The service with all the staff was 1st rate. We will definitely stay there again.,5,2022,08,14
23,Perfect,"Just perfect! The room, The rooftop, The breakfast, The people, The roomservice, The reception. The restaurant, The airco, The bath, The service, The location, The swimmingpool, The bathsalt and the ambiance❤️",5,2022,08,14
23,Superlative in every way,"I have travelled the world 5*. I wasn’t expecting anything special from this stay, but I was blown away. Not by the very nice interior, which is designer but very comfortable, not by the very good breakfast which is varied, fresh , high quality and not rushed or over crowded, but by the staff.  The staff in this hotel ensure that it is a step above most other 5* hotels. They are helpful, discreet, always on hand, proactive, very international and very professional. Always there for whatever you need, immediately. They are superbly trained. 
This is what made our long weekend in Barcelona exceptional. This is a super hotel, for comfort, excellent location, quality and most other things expected of a 5*. But you will be hard pressed to find a better experience in terms of being made to feel totally looked after. 

Do not hesitate if you are thinking of booking it. 
Thanks to the hotel for a lovely stay. I will be back!",5,2022,08,14
23,Above and beyond,"Edward couldn’t have been more wonderful. 

From the moment  we entered he truly took care of us and tended to every question and need. 

A charming,  friendly and perfect example of the kind of service that is expected in the hospitality business and how you should be taken care of in such establishments.",5,2022,08,14
23,5 star,"First class service from the second we walked through the door, special shout out to the lady on the desk called Jenny, so pleasant, friendly, professional and couldn’t do enough for us as we arrived early..she’s a asset to the hotel, so far unbelievable experience, food great too",5,2022,08,12
23,Great Location but not a great sleep,"I stayed at Ohla for 4 nights. The welcome we received was very warm.  I asked it if was possible to get a room with 2 beds vs. one king.  They phoned housekeeping and asked for our bed to be divided and they confirmed about 10 minutes later that our room was ready.   The beds were not divided.  Ah well, kind of minor.  The bigger issue was that our room was beside the elevators, which are incredibly loud. The staircase that runs beside the elevators is beautiful, but open-concept. It is a noise tunnel. We could hear voices & shouting in the evening when the rooftop bar was open to the public. I don't really like the public having access to our floor. One night some very drunk people were walking up and down the hallway, thinking they were on the ground floor (We were 2).  

- The rooftop pool & bar is beautiful and wonderful to have. When it is open to the public, it is very busy.
- the breakfast buffet is excellent
- the airconditioning works well

Another small think that happened was, we were given a bottle of welcome Cava, but when we didn't open it on the 1st night, it was taken away.  Again, minor, but a bummer.  I asked for it to be returned, but it was not.  

The front desk was very helpful in booking tickets and the staff were generally very nice.",3,2022,08,09
23,"Great hotel, great location, great staff","Just spent 6 nights in the Ohla Barcelona for my birthday. Location, rooms, breakfast, roof top bar are excellent but the thing that really stood out was the staff, nothing was too much trouble for the Concierge team for restaurant bookings etc. Special mention has to go to Zak on the front desk, Zak you are a credit to this hotel and thanks for all your help and laughs.",5,2022,08,02
23,"Great hotel, fab location, friendly and welcoming staff, truly a joy of a hotel. ","just spent 5 days here at Ohla Barcelona, absolutely the best city break ever the roof top bar and pool are fab, nice relaxed atmosphere not overly priced and staff are very acomodating, it's perfectly situated for exploring. The room was nicely decorated with all the aminaties you need, breakfast is a relaxed affair with plenty of choice I would highly recommend this fab hotel. Nothing was to much trouble, the concierge were very helpful as were all the staff. ",5,2022,08,01
23,Excellent Service,"Our stay at Ohla was a very pleasant experience. The concierge service specifically was superb. All of their recommendations based on our interests were right on point. The rooms were very modern and clean. The breakfast buffet was tasty and the service in the restaurant nice as well. A special thank you to Javi, our concierge who made our stay in Barcelona accommodating. Lastly, the rooftop bar is special experience.",5,2022,07,28
23,Perfect hotel,"The Olha Barcelona hotel is a perfectly situated hotel right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. The staff were friendly and welcoming throughout and nothing was too much trouble. The room was comfortable and clean with the restaurant breakfasts being plentiful and delicious. 
We will return to Barcelona and will definately be staying here again. 
Thanks again for an enjoyable break",5,2022,07,25
23,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"Great hotel, great location and facilities, exceeded only by the wonderful and attentive staff. Nothing too much trouble and a total attention to detail.

The food in the restaurant for both Breakfast and Lunch was superb and the rooftop bar and pool a welcome site after a long day site seeing.",5,2022,07,22
23,Amazing,The concierge team are the most amazing ive ever experienced. Always on top of things. The hotel is amazing and the rooftop views are to die for. The music here is always on point. Central location and easy walking distance to so many interesting locations.,5,2022,07,22
23,A truly marvellous hotel,"Hotel Ohla Barcelona doesn't disappoint on any level, but the real stars of this establishment are the staff: they are just wonderful. They could not do enough to help, whether it was advice on restaurants, opening doors, or just asking how our day had been, they are all heroes. The hotel itself is really lovely, bedrooms are comfortable, clean and quiet, the food is fabulous, the drinks (especially the cocktails) are superb and the pool is a little piece of heaven. We loved our stay, thank you Ohla Barcelona. ",5,2022,07,21
23,Excellent value,"We stayed in a junior suite which was superbly designed . …… well worth the couple of extra dollars . It is an Excellent hotel in a fantastic position great for strolling out to dinner , shopping and site seeing . One of the very few to have a roof top bar & pool .",5,2022,07,21
23,Amazing hotel in heart of Barcelona,"10/10. Entire experience was amazing. We stayed for 4 nights and could not have been happier. Greeted with Cava and warm towels, nice gym with sauna, and clean rooms. Great rooftop bar/pool! Excellent staff. We will definitely be back!",5,2022,07,18
23,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"What a wonderful stay we had here, loved the exceptional service, the roof top bar and the breakfast. The room was modern and the bed very comfortable. Great location, easy walk to everywhere and close to the police station so very safe. Huge supermarket across the road to stock up on anything you wanted for the room. Only downfall was the rooftop bar being closed one of our nights for a private function which was disappointing as our favorite nightly hangout to watch the sunsets. We will definitely be back next year",5,2022,07,17
23,Amazing stay !!!,We stayed 3 nights and had an amazing stay. Very impressed by the quality of the service and great accommodation. Whouahh ! I would without hesitation recommend this hotel so well located near the Rambla,5,2022,07,12
23,Wow!!,"What an amazing hotel. Its in such a great area. We were upgraded to a junior suite on arrival which was so nice as it was out 25th wedding anniversary. The room was fantastic and the bed so comfortable. The staff are lovey and so accommodating. Our return flight was in the evening but they let us use the hotel facilities all day after we'd checked out. Zak was particular helpful. The best part of the hotel is the roof top pool with amazing views of the city and great cocktails. It is truly amazing. Breakfast was delicious too and so fresh. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the loud music at breakfast. It was irritating but thats just our personal preference, it didn't spoil our amazing stay in any way. Thank you so much for taking such good care of us and making our stay so special. ",5,2022,07,11
23,Great hotel - Great location,"We walked to the hotel from the Aerobus stop ( Aerobus used from the airport)  outside El Corte Ingles depot. store - 10 minutes walk. Hotel is in a perfect location to walk to many places with a Metro stop near by or bus stops too. Staff were excellent- very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was excellent.  Our 1st floor room ( a junior suite) at the front of the hotel was large and very comfortable with everything we needed. (Bed very comfortable ). The reluctant 4 star and not a 5 star rating was because our room on the corner of a side street had the noise of lorries and vans delivering and off- loading goods to the local shops and restaurants with early morning the worst period. ( The busy main road outside wasn't a problem though ). Avoid the lower floor side street rooms and this is a very good hotel.

23,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"Really enjoyed our stay at Ohla Barcelona. Great service from the Ohla Barcelona team, stunning room and great facilities - the roof top was beautiful! The location was perfect for exploring everything Barcelona has to offer on foot. Will be booking another stay here in the future!",5,2022,07,04
23,Faultless Couples Holiday,"Excellent stay for my birthday and a week’s holiday with my partner. We arrived on a Friday morning, and the concierge kindly took our bags and we were provided with free cava and water whilst we checked in. As it was my birthday, when we first entered the room, the room had been decorated with balloons, a bottle of cava, a small chocolate cake, and the mirror decorated with “Happy Birthday!” written. The room was regularly cleaned to an exceptional standard. Breakfast had a lovely variety of pastries, fruit, cereal, and  cooked meat such as chipolata sausages, bacon, tomatoes, aubergines and a variety of egg options. The roof terrace was one of the key reasons we booked this hotel, and it was very beautiful - it was much smaller than it seemed in photos and the pool seemed as if it was more for show than for leisure - but it did not detract from how beautiful the view was. Drinks were quite expensive, however we appreciate this is due to the popularity of the bar. I would recommend staying here if you don’t mind walking or travelling a bit further to the different areas, as it was around a 20+ minute walk to all of the tourist hotspots I.e. Barceloneta beach, sagrada familia, Picasso museum however there are bus routes and the hotel does offer a transport service. Overall; a beautiful place to stay, and if we were ever to visit Barcelona again, we would certainly consider staying here again.",5,2022,07,03
23,Fabulous !,"We loved everything (and everyone) at Ohla hotel ! The location, the rooms, the breakfast, all of it is perfect. Everyone is so helpful,friendly,  welcoming, polite and professional. We would definitely go back !",5,2022,06,30
23,"Not a good hotel, an OUTSTANDING hotel","Stayed here as a short break for my wife's birthday.  The location of the hotel was brilliant in the gothic area. The view from the Rooftop Bar is brilliant.  The main holiday attractions are all within 30 minute walks and near  La Ramblas.  On the day of my wife's birthday, we had been out sight seeing for the day and returned to the room to find a small birthday cake, a birthday card, a bottle of cava and Happy Birthday written on the full length mirror.

The experiences team were fantastic and nothing (and I mean nothing) was a problem for them.  They even managed to get us a booking at the Hard Rock when it said no availability (we have eaten at Hard Rock cafes all over the world so wanted to make sure we ate at the Barcelona one)  

The bed was a little firm and spoke to the experience team and they said we could have a topper or 2 toppers or even  a mattress replacement.  Topper fitted and had great sleep.

Would stay here again if ever in Barcelona and would recommend Ohla Hotel to anyone who asked for a hotel in Barcelona",5,2022,06,29
23,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here with some friends and loved the hotel. The location was great, hotel very clean and modern and the staff were so friendly and helpful. Noting was too much trouble and they helped us with restaurant bookings and cabs and were so accommodating. The rooftop bar is fabulous and was great for before and after dinner cocktails! Thoroughly recommend this hotel and it’s great staff - we had an amazing few days! Thank you Ohla!",5,2022,06,27
23,Fantastic Stay,"The check in might be the coolest process I have ever experienced. From the moment we walked in, the staff was attentive, helpful and extremely friendly. The hotel is well maintained, the rooms were spacious and the rooftop bar is an absolute MUST! The location was exactly where we wanted to be and very accessible. We will be back.",5,2022,06,27
23,5 stars all the way,"We stayed in Hotel Ohla for 3
Nights in June. What a hotel. A hotel that certainly has the wow factor. Staff were so helpful and friendly. 

Breakfast was excellent each morning with a great selection. There is a lovely rooftop pool and bar which we enjoyed. 

A special mention to the housekeeping staff. I have never stayed in a hotel before where my room was tidied and cleaned to such a high standard. They really took the time and care to clean our room and even laid out my toiletries and accessories so neatly each day in our room. 

Hotel is in a great location approx a 5 minute walk to Las Ramblas and about a 20 minute walk to the beach. Great selection of bars and restaurants close by and the hotel itself has a Michelin star restaurant which unfortunately didn’t get around to dining in on this visit. 

Highly recommend a stay in Hotel Ohla.",5,2022,06,27
23,A wonderful stay in Barcelona!,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was simply wonderful! This is without a doubt one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and would stay again in a heartbeat. We arrived very late in the evening and were still greeted with smiles and very accommodating staff. The location is really ideal for travelling to different places in the city. The rooftop bar is also stunning - we made full use of this during our stay. Our room was spacious and clean (the air con was amazing in the intense heat!). We traveled for my partner's birthday and she was treated to a bottle of cava, cake, chocolates, balloons and a card! The staff really went above and beyond to make our entire stay a wonderful experience. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Barcelona.",5,2022,06,25
23,Best Hotel Stay Ever,"We stayed at the Ohla Barcelona for three nights. This was a special trip as it was a belated ""big birthday"" holiday I'd booked for my partner. Everything was perfect, from the pre-stay communications from the Customer Experience Team, to our departure.

On arrival we were greeted with welcome offers of cava, lemonade and water, together with towels (and after three years of not being out of England, the European heat really hits you), and we were speedily checked in and, even better, upgraded to a Deluxe Room, which had every amenity you could think of. The shower in the middle of the room was an unusual and original design feature, but worked really well in every sense. Delightful designer toiletries and even dental kits were provided. Even more unusually, there were plenty of drawers for storing clothes, as well as a good sized wardrobe. The bed was blissfully comfortable. A particularly nice touch was the frequently replenished complimentary mineral water.

The evening turndown service was splendid - staff checked to see if we needed anything and even if we didn't left edible treats.

Breakfast was excellent - perfect coffee and lots of food choice. The ham, cheese and bread were especially good.

The hotel is in an excellent location, equidistant between two Metro stations and within walking distance of fine restaurants, shops, and Placa Catalunya for sightseeing buses.

The 8th floor terrace with its infinity pool is simply amazing. Drinks and food are expensive, but I'd recommend at least one visit for the sublime experience. If you fancy a dip, pool towels are provided and you can lie around in the sun after. Alternatively, a late night visit (bar open till 1am to residents) is a perfect end to the day for the chill-out music and moonlit views over the city.

I've saved the best till last. The staff are incredible. Totally service and guest orientated, with nothing being too much trouble  I'd particularly like to thank Xavier for his pre-stay emails; the ever-helpful and patient Ferran for his help with the safe, and the ever-smiling Zak for all his help throughout our stay.

I would return to the Ohla Barcelona without hesitation, and would like to thank everyone at the hotel for enabling a wonderful holiday.",5,2022,06,22
23,Hotel with a wow factor,"Fantastic 3 nights stay at Ohla Barcelona! Loved everything, very comfortable bed and bright specious room, the breakfast was also really good. Top location, we walked everywhere from there and never took too long . The staff was so friendly and professional with very good English too. We are so happy to have stayed here…thanks for a lovely stay!!! 💕",5,2022,06,19
23,"Fun, Funky & First Class",Loved this hotel.  Great location - steps to the Gothic district.  Lots of shopping and dining very close by.  The staff was super helpful and the experience was top notch.  A very nice breakfast included as well.  I would stay here again in a heart beat!,5,2022,06,15
23,Short Break Away,"Booked junior suite and the room was spacious, comfortable and very clean (plus great views).  Breakfast - good selection and food was lovely.  Roof top terrace provides amazing views.  Staff very friendly and helpful at all times.  Would definitely recommend and will book again.  Great location and very central.",5,2022,06,13
23,A couples city break in Barcelona!!,"We recently stayed at Ohla Barcelona for 3 nights and found the hotel to be excellent. We were given Cava on arrival and the staff made us feel very welcome throughout our stay. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was very spacious with a bath and street views. However, the best thing about this hotel is the rooftop bar which offers amazing views of the Sagrada Familia and the city of Barcelona and is a perfect place to catch the sun for a few hours. We will definitely be staying again!!",5,2022,06,12
23,Fantastic 24 hours in Barcelona,"My partner and I had the greatest 24 hour stay at the Ohla Barcelona - from the service upon check in, to the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms to the beautiful sunset views on the rooftop - we would certainly recommend this hotel. We are looking forward to our next visit!",5,2022,06,10
23,These folks truly care about your stay.,"We felt welcome and cared for from the moment we walked in the door.  Everyone we encountered was kind and always offering to be of assistance.  The rooms are beautiful and spacious.  The property is meticulous maintained.  The breakfast was terrific, with many choices.  The rooftop bar was really nice and guests are given preference when things get busy there.  

We spent almost four weeks skipping across Europe and this was our favorite hotel by a fairly wide margin.   Everything about it is directed at making your stay special.",5,2022,06,09
23,Excellent location !,"We stayed one night in Barcelona and we found the hotel to be excellent. The reception staff made us feel very welcome and very helpful in providing information about Barcelona. We were greeted with a nice towel and glass of Cava !
Zak, the employee who helped us with our luggage at time of arrival and at departure was very courteous and helpful in responding to our needs.
Roof top bar and pool were amazing, providing a beautiful view of the city.",5,2022,06,09
23,Beautiful Views,"Beautiful views of the city and the sea, nice drinks, and a really lovely vibe. I would definitely come back here and spend more time. The drinks are priced well, and it's really chill. I think I'll definitely be back for some more summer night drinks.",5,2022,05,31
23,Worth the money!,"We chose to stay at 3 separate hotels during our week in Barcelona. Hotel ohla was by far the best of the 3! It is on the pricier end but the hotel staff and accommodations are beyond our expectations. Jenny at the reception was extremely helpful and kind! Zak was very kind and always willing to help with our bags and help us get a taxi as well as recommend places to visit and walk! Charlie at the experience desk was the best at recommending restaurants for all meals! The rooftop is absolutely stunning. We cannot wait for our next time back at ohla!! 
-Grace & Connor",5,2022,05,31
23,An Oasis in the city,"Greeting - from the start they make you feel welcome, with friendly staff and a glass of something you fancy 

Room - well laid out, spacious, the bed dreamy, shower was sexy and all the little luxuries you expect 

Breakfast - Small but solid offering, coffee needs improving and service was a little disorganised. For a 5 star we expected to be offered eggs cooked our way but instead had to hunt a server down to order

Cocktail bar - rooftop is a winner .. service good, drinks were mixed well and the view is stunning 

Hotel is so well situated also, this is a big winner for us 

Special shout out to Zac who could not do enough for us… thank you so much

We will be back (but pls improve breakfast?)",4,2022,05,28
23,Amazing 🤩,"Fabulous! We’ve had an amazing trip to Barcelona, staying at Ohla Barcelona for 5nts in total over two visits. The experience on both occasions was fab!  Staff were very welcoming on arrival and every time you walked into the hotel. Rooms were wonderful too! Loved the rooftop bar and pool, amazing views of the city. Perfectly located near La Ramblas, all the main sites, close to the port etc. We can’t say anything negative to be honest. Thank you 😊 ❤️",5,2022,05,26
23,Mahmoud and Selma’s honey moon,"My wife and I stayed at Ohla while we were in Barcelona for our honey moon. We are extremely glad we pick Ohla. The team there were so polite and kind and helpful. Juanma, David, Anna and Anbel were extremely kind and professional to us. We plan on staying here next time we visit.",5,2022,05,24
23,Beautiful hotel in a great location!,"This hotel exceeded all of our expectations!  Beautiful property, amazing service and staff, nicely appointed room, impressive rooftop bar, and a incredible breakfast buffet in their wonderful restaurant!  Definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2022,05,23
23,Loved it at Ohla,"From the very warm and friendly welcome, excellent location to fantastic attention to detail the Ohla was a joy to stay at.

Although it’s a 5* it’s got a very laid back feel and the team were so helpful and professional without a hint of pretentiousness. The room was spotless and made for a very comfortable nights sleep. Breakfast was your traditional continental buffet breakfast & I couldn’t fault it, all the produce was delicious and the kitchen rustled up some very yummy gluten free options for my friend. 

The hotel is located in my favourite area of Barcelona, The Gothic Quarter. It’s quiet with beautiful tall buildings and narrow streets that provide some welcome shade when it’s hot & lots of bars and restaurants offering tempting menus. The Picasso museum is just a five minute walk, Sagrada Familia a 25minute walk and Parc Guell just a few stops on the metro or short bus ride. If you like Gaudi the Casa Barcelo and Casa Milla are also just a short stroll and well worth a visit. I can also highly recommend 4 Al Gats restaurant which is very close to the hotel. Food was delicious and there was an element of theatre to the service. This restaurant is quite famous as Picasso used to visit with friends and was commissioned to design the menu artwork. It doesn’t look like it’s changed much at all but that adds to the charm. 

If you want any tickets booked or recommendations head to the ‘Experience’ desk and the guys will point you in the right direction. 

The rooftop pool and bar offered a nice retreat after lots of sightseeing with some good views. It’s fairly pricey but hey ho, I guess it’s just what you’d expect in an expensive city centre hotel. 

If you’re flying into Barcelona airport it’s so easy to get to, you just hop on one of the blue airport buses and twenty minutes later you arrive at the Playca de Catalunya for 5.90euro and then you’re just a five minute walk from the Ohla. 

I’d definitely like to return to the Ohla when I next visit Barcelona.",5,2022,05,23
23,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed here for our first holiday in years and the experience was amazing. When we arrived we were courteously greeted at the experience desk and taken to reception where we were seated, offered a drink and checked in. We were then guided to our room, which was lovely. Now, the only slight odd thing is that it is, apart from the loo, open plan. This means the shower is open to all to see. I guess this could make some uncomfortable having to shower in plain view. Other than that the room was a good size, well appointed and ideal for what we needed. Breakfast was the same every day, but there was plenty of it and it was very tasty, setting us up well for the day. We used the experience team a few times to recommend restaurants and they came up trumps every time. Nothing is too much for them, ask them anything and if they can help they will. The rooftop bar and pool is excellent if a little expensive. The views are unique and there is plenty of space to sit. The bar opens at 4pm but before then you can either take your own or pop to the plassohla on the ground floor and they will happily serve you a drink. The rooftop pool shuts at 7 and they let the public in but we were typically gone by then. In all a fantastic hotel and well worth its 5 stars. We'd stay there again in a heart beat, we loved every moment.",5,2022,05,21
23,The absolute best service and comfortable rooms,"I recently stayed at the Ohla Barcelona after a cruise, and the experience was absolutely wonderful.

We arrived quite early, and while they couldn't give us early checkin due to a busy weekend, the staff was extremely gracious and was very quick to take and hold our luggage for us while we explored Barcelona for the day.

Throughout the initial luggage-holding process and then later the actual check-in process, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone was a joy to work with, bellhops, front desk and all.

The room itself was extremely clean, and pretty spacious by Barcelona standards, and the bed was comfortably firm.

The rooftop bar was also an absolute pleasure to visit during the sunset hours, and while it wasn't cheap, the quality of both the drinks and food were high and the overall experience was very much worth it. Just be aware of possibly long elevator wait times (ride the elevator down to the lobby and back up if need be).

I would absolutely return here for another visit in the future, and highly recommend this place.",5,2022,05,20
23,Hot and cold!,"We stayed with friends for a weekend break. The hotel is in a great area and just a short walk to the metro. The staff were all pleasant and happy to help. 
The rooms were fine if not a wow factor, but the shower (for all 4 rooms) was dreadful in that one minute it was hot and the next freezing, and the shower never kept the water in so it would leak all over the floor (again this was the same for everyone) Breakfast on the Saturday morning was very busy (fine on the other 2 days) and they just didn’t have the space to seat everyone, but luckily the weather was nice so they set up a table outside, otherwise it would have been a lengthy wait. The breakfast itself was ok. It was a buffet only with no option to order anything fresh like eggs, pancakes or omelettes. 
The rooftop terrace was the highlight for us. A really great space to chill and relax and take in the view. It was just a shame the pool had no water on it so it did look quite ugly. I understand it might have been too cold to swim but it would have at least looked amazing like the pics!!! 
As I have said the staff were all lovely but I just got the feeling they were a little understaffed, as service was slow and on the terrace it did take sometime to get drinks. 
None of this is a deal breaker, and we would definitely return and look forward to more cold beers on the roof terrace again soon.",4,2022,04,12
23,5 star with a 3 star experience,"I guess hotel reviews are subjective. We stayed here in 2017, it was great.

This time sadly the same cannot be said. We were in a junior suite. The room is tired, simple things like replacing washers on shower heads so that water doesn’t spew out everywhere, to the stupid, non movable placement of the tv. Then there is the noise, not from with but from outside. I’m not sure who supplied the double glazing to the hotel, but they should ask for their money back. 4 floors up and the noise from outside is ridiculous, 3 nights of broken sleep.

The staff weren’t much to get excited about. We ask the concierge to book us a good steak/pasta place, took their advice and asked them to book a taxi.

Taxi arrived, driver had no idea where we wanted to go! Surely the concierge should have dealt with that, turns out restaurant was a seafood restaurant, evening ruined as we then had to traipse around looking for somewhere else.

Sadly, all these little things add up and are not what I expect from a 5 star establishment. We won’t be back.",3,2022,04,10
23,Amazing trip to Barcelona at a perfect hotel!,"Ohla Barcelona is not only aesthetically beautiful but also at a prime, safe location. It is ~5 minutes walking distance to Barcelona Cathedral and ~10 minutes walking distance to Gothic Quarter and El Born neighborhood that is filled with amazing restaurants and bars. It is ~15-20 minutes walking distance to Pg de Gracia and Sagrada Familia as well. We were able to walk everywhere at ease. From the front desk (shoutout to Edu, Zak, and everyone else) to housekeeping (Alejandra), everyone has been so wonderful and made us feel at home. The bed was very comfortable. Every day, we had housekeeping twice a day with impeccable cleaning. Breakfast buffet was also amazing with lots of options, which was great since we were on the go every early morning! Lastly, the room smelled amazing. I don’t know what they use but I wish our home smelled like that. I highly recommend this hotel if you’re visiting Barcelona. We will be back, hopefully soon!",5,2022,04,09
23,Fabulous find in Barcelona - great location & quirky decor,"Beautiful hotel in an excellent location. I stayed for 4 nights and check in and check out were both fast and efficient.

My room was clean and the bed was super comfortable, bathroom was well appointed with lovely toiletries and water pressure was perfect in the shower. 

A few small drawbacks - you can hear the metro go by regularly, but it’s more a rumble than a loud noise. Nothing to be concerned about! English speaking tv channels are few - but in a city like Barcelona there is plenty of other things to do! 

Breakfast every morning was really good - nice selection & variety, as well as alternative milks readily available to cater for different diets. There was one morning at breakfast where I felt under pressure to leave even though it was only 11:10 and breakfast is supposed to continue until 11:30, one staff member came and cleared a few things off my table while I was still drinking my coffee. But in general all the staff were very helpful and accommodating.

The view from the rooftop bar is great, and the vibe is good. Drinks are well made and bar staff are attentive! 

All in all I would definitely recommend for a city break stay, and I would 100% stay again.",5,2022,04,09
23,A gem in the Gothic quarter,"This hotel is an absolute gem. It has so much to offer. Great restaurants (Caelis is incredible), central location, amazing staff and the best rooftop bar. The room and facilities were all immaculate. It’s unlikely we would choose to stay anywhere else in Barcelona after this visit.",5,2022,04,04
23,Zak and Gina thank you !!,"Wonderful experience 
Exceeded expectations a rare event these days
Wonderful hotel in a fantastic position 
Yes the metro does rumble a bit

But lovely staff and rooms make up for this

Special thanks to Zak always a smile and so helpful 

And Gina as above . such an asset to the hotel

We can’t wait to visit again",5,2022,03,24
23,Perfect location,"4 night stay in mid March. Very smart hotel in perfect location in gothic quarter. Stone's throw from cathedral and walking distance to several attractions. Buffet breakfast was fine. Restaurant dinner OK.
Staff very good. Carlos thank you so much for the tapas bar recommendations - one of the highlights of our stay!
Only niggle was room (108) which on 1st floor at front of hotel was very noisy overnight. If you're offered this room, politely refuse. We should have asked to be moved but foolishly didn't so disturbed nights every night. No doubt this particular room was in worst location in hotel - on street corner, low level and that others would be much better.",4,2022,03,20
23,For a 5 star hotel I was not expecting this...,"I was traveling with a friend and we stayed in Ohla Barcelona for 3 nights from the 3rd to the 6th of March. Staying in a 5 star hotel you have certain expectations and not even the basic were met: every time we entered the hotel the staff would make mean comments regarding our age and appearance in Spanish, unfortunately for them I speak Spanish and was extremely disgusted with the comments saying that we probably were in the wrong hotel... terrible service. Also the breakfast is very poor, the eggs are powder eggs... the rooftop is closed which is suppose to be the main attraction of the hotel and no one mentioned that, not even on the website. Will definitely not be returning to this hotel ever again since they don't even know how to treat their own guests.",2,2022,03,13
23,Great Hotel Experience,"I went to Barcelona a week ago and stayed in OHLA BARCELONA HOTEL. My experience was amazing. The hotell is situated in GOTHIC QUARTER. Excellent location. The hotel is very clean, smells good.. with a Michelin Star restaurant. But what is amaZing about this hotel are the staff.. The staff are incredible . The most polite, friendly, cool hotel staff i have ever encountered.. shout out to the staff: CARLOS, ALBA, BELEN, JOAN, SARA, JAVIER, DAVID. They are the best… they are very helpful and genuine.. They should be given a raise for the best costumer service they give the guests… Ther are simply amazing… Whenever i come back to Barcelona.. i will agin choose OHLA HOTEL BARCELONA because of my amazing experience.. given to me by the staff. Keep up the good work.",5,2022,02,28
23,Rooftop Bar is closed for February - Not on Website,"I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights 11th and 12th February 2022 which we were very much looking forward to as were meeting up with friends over from Canada. It looked great on review sites and their own website. However, they didn’t feel the need to advise beforehand (directly or through their website) that their go-to destination of their roof top bar and social meeting place is closed for February!

Smaller niggles is 1) that there is no comfy seating or lounge area to meet and relax in (unless this was on the roof terrace) and 2) be careful with the shower - it suddenly goods very hot and/or very cold

I don’t expect this of a 5* hotel

I’m also annoyed that there still is no mention of the rooftop bar closure on their website and I’m staying again this Saturday 19th as I prepaid my reservation",3,2022,02,16
23,Perfect spot for a city break,"Spent a weekend here - was a perfect location to explore Barcelona. The hotel is lovely - all staff very friendly and helpful. Gina and Joan were particularly helpful when we checked in (and gave us a very welcome glass of Cava!) We didn’t get to try the main restaurant as it was fully booked, but we enjoyed the roof terrace. Walking distance to lots of good eating and drinking spots. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2021,11,21
23,Nice hotel that can do better,"Pros: 
Best hairdrier ever in a hotel. Bvulgari toiletries. Great breakfast roomservice. 
Supernice check-in, smooth and easy accompanied by a glass of cava and a chocolate covered strawberry.

Cons: cleaning. Toilet in our room was full of stains that was easily washed off on walls and door. Cold at night, hard to adjust temperature. 
Winebar closed. No sunbeds at the rooftop and pool is more for decorative puposes than to actually use. 
Menu at rooftop should contain more food than just snacks. Difficult to find someone who actually works. But I understand staffing is cut short in these times and at this time of the year. 

All in all a nice hotel, I’d come back any time just for the check-in but for cleanliness and value for money I’d probably stay somewhere else.",4,2021,11,18
23,Boutique Art Luxury,"Great hôtel, perfect location, fashion forward rooms, everything you can expect from a 5 star hotel. What however makes the difference are the staff. Very personal service, ensuring you get the best experience possible. The concierge Xavi ensured we were able to enjoy the most special restaurants and also the rest of the staff went the extra mile to make sure you feel special and at home.  Special thanks to David for his extra attention and top professional service.",5,2021,11,04
23,Redefines 5 stars—absolutely amazing experience,"We loved, loved, loved this hotel!! From the warm welcome on arrival, and help with the slightly tight parking, to the end of our stay, everything was above and beyond five stars. Our room on the 6th floor was modern, practical, clean and bright with lovely views. The rooftop is amazing. The food at breakfast and for dinner in the restaurant was excellent. But what really made our stay were the staff who were just superb—always smiling, always helpful, always friendly, and with lots of extra special touches to spoil our six year old including a drawing kit, sweets and a teddy bear. Thank you for making our stay unforgettable and bravo to all the staff. Hasta pronto!",5,2021,11,04
23,Awesome in every way,"This hotel is just tremendous. The staff is beyond awesome, a specific shout out to Xavi. The location of the hotel is fabulous, as you are walking distance to the Barcelona Cathedral and right next to the yellow line metro stop and a close walk to Plaza Catalunya and the green line. The rooftop bar is for sure worth a stop for the views (though drinks aren’t cheap)…the locals line up to head up so you know it’s a sight to see. The rooms are unique in the sense the shower is right smack dab in the middle of the room and the toilet is in a secret cubby in the wall, so you better be real friendly with who you go with. There is a Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel and the other hotel restaurant is very good if you don’t want to spend. There is no question this would be the hotel I would return to in Barcelona",5,2021,10,28
23,Very nice,"A very attractive and comfortable hotel. Great location and roof top bar. Good service,  helpful and friendly staff. Not too sure about the open plan bathroom though others may like it. Bedrooms not luxurious but I would definitely recommend.",4,2021,10,25
23,Above and Beyond at every step,"Stayed for 4 days with my girlfriend and was bowled over by how kind and accommodating the hotel staff were. From concierge to reception to waiting staff and everyone else, we were always greeted with smiles and  everything we needed. I'm so thankful for how special they made our stay, going above and beyond at every stage. They really were fantastic. Hotel facilities are lovely breakfast set us up fantastically for the day and the rooftop is a delight. Very highly recommend and will go back every time we visit Barcelona.",5,2021,10,19
23,"Great location, decor and amazing views of Barca!","Absolutely loved the location, where the views from the rooftop terrace were second to none! Really lovely staff as well. I can't wait to return to have a drink and watch the sunset from the rooftop terrace again!",4,2021,10,15
23,"Great Hotel, Staff and Location","Stayed three nights at the Hotel Ohla and was very satisfied with the whole experience.  The staff was always very nice, welcoming and helpful while demonstrating steadfast professionalism.  The room, hallways and public areas of the hotel itself were always clean, with ample sanitary stations for guests.  The rooftop bar was pleasant and breakfast had a good variety of breads, fruits, warm dishes, etc. that were constantly replaced/replenished so as never to look as if they had run out of something.  It is well located, near the Gothic Quarter, a border of the Quadrat d'Or and the waterfront, with the Urquinaona metro station (Lines 1 and 4) a couple of blocks away.  If coming by car, there is no specific hotel parking but they have an arrangement with a public lot a few blocks away that will provide a discounted rate when staying at the property.

I would highly recommend a stay at the Hotel Ohla when visiting Barcelona and would not hesitate to return again.",5,2021,10,09
23,Great boutique hotel ideally located on edge of gothic quarter,"Spaciois light room, high ceilings, great view.
Breakfast buffet with nothing missing. Fantastic lunch in the 1 Michelin star resaturant, Caelis. Drinks and a swim on the roof top terrace perfects your stay, with city and cathedral views",5,2021,10,07
23,Amazing weekend!,"I want to say a massive thank you to the team at Hotel Ohla. I arranged a surprise weekend stay for my son and his girlfriend to celebrate their 21st birthdays and joint graduations this year. The staff made their stay very special.  Their room was upgraded and they had a personalised message congratulating them on their degree success written on the white board wall in their room, together with a bottle of cava and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for them. My son and girlfriend were completely blown-away by everything - their room and the stunning views, the roof top bar and pool, the exceptionally friendly staff and breakfast. It surpassed all expectations. It only remains now for me to pay a visit! Thank you for everything!",5,2021,09,28
23,Attention to Detail,"I booked Ohla Barcelona the night before my arrival. Everything was perfect, the staff, the room. Just breath taking. The bath tub is a MUST! upon arrival I was greeted with chocolate covered strawberries & champagne. The room just felt like a breath of fresh air. Complimentary breakfast was so yummy. The rooftop is so nice and quaint. Highly recommend this hotel and hats off to the staff for being so friendly, kind and amazing. After my extensive vacation through 3 other countries, I must say Ohla takes the cake! Will be back.",5,2021,09,09
23,Amazing hotel!,"This hotel met all our needs, it was a great experience from start tell the end of our stay. We wanted to unplug from a busy day and be pampered. The hotel is clean, the rooms are large, and they offer a good varied breakfast plus they have some friendly and nice staff. Okay, cadeu to the receptionist that was helpful, kind and smiling every time he saw us and also to the other staff around the hotel that always were kind. The location allowed us to walk to most places, which was very nice. The hotel is close to the gothic area, which means that one's walks do not get a second boring. We enjoyed to see the extraordinary buildings, boutiques, cafes, different kind of people - everything in general. We used taxi only twice. We had a meal once in the restaurant and this can also can be highly recommended. The rooftop is cozy and has a nice view, good drinks. It’s suitable for families with kids also - both at day and at night time.",5,2021,09,06
23,"Stylish, friendly hotel in great location","We stayed here over the long weekend and only have good things to say! The staff were very friendly and always helpful with a smile! The hotel itself has a modern boutique style with some fun art features throughout. The real treat is the rooftop bar which is perfect for a drink at sunset and beyond! 

It's very well located for shopping and restaurants or to the Metro which is very easy to use. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,08,30
23,Outstanding Customer Service!,"The location is perfect! It is close to the La Rambla, Marina, Mercado La Boqueria, Place Catalunya, etc., all walking distances. Breakfast is really great, and the restaurant offers superior service and excellent food. I would say service was certainly unique with all the hotel staff speaking fluent English and French . Thank you to all the staff at Ohla Barcelona for making our stay memorable.",5,2021,08,28
23,We simply loved it!,"We stayed at Hotel Ohla and our experience was perfect! The place is absolutely beautiful and the reception team was always willing ot help us. Besides, the location is impossible to beat.I would definitely stay there again.",5,2021,08,17
23,Ohla Barcelona,"Apart from good location and decent personnel, this is an old building superficially refurbished many years ago, out of date,  not very clean, poor breakfast, room and bathroom small with bare minimum facilities.",1,2021,07,27
23,CANCELLATION ! WHAT CANCELLATION ???!!!,"Booked a trip in May and had to cancel due to covid as I couldn’t travel, cancelled in accordance with hotel and Booking.com policy, still got charged the full amount for the stay. Unbelievable ! Both hotel and booking site both denied I had cancelled the reservation despite being told by Booking.com it was in fact cancelled ! 
 
NO POINT CALLING HOTEL, MANAGERS ARE CONSTANTLY UNAVAILABLE  👀🙄",1,2021,06,13
23,Very nice view on a rooftop in Barcelona!,"The Sangria was tasty on a beautiful rooftop! 
We had 3 glasses each for 33€ so it’s a bit pricy but first it’s a 5 stars hotel and you’re well located with an amazing view… it becomes acceptable on holidays!
Unfortunately, the sun wasn’t here for us but still the pool and the music made us enjoying our moment there!",5,2021,05,30
23,Summer week end,"I stayed there end of august during 2 nights : perfect location , in the center , 20 minutes from airport with taxi and 10 minutes to the beach. Friendly and efficient welcome ( lobby is small , you have to go to restaurant or bar for a discussion ) .I took a standard room , quite modern, nice design . But : the shower is in the middle of the room so it was good that i was alone , otherwise no real privacy . Bed is very good ,room was quiet . Great roof top , pool is beautiful but quite narrow , so no more that 4 or 5 people at a time . Service is nice and effcient but the waiters were joking among themselves a bit too loudly for a 5 star hotel . Breakfast is excellent, buffet with good choice in a nice dining room . I also had lunch there , it was delicious. I will come back !!!",5,2020,09,16
23,Fantastic hotel in the perfect location,"Stayed here for three nights in July. We ended up here by accident after our original hotel cancelled, but couldn’t have worked out better. The junior suite is generous by any hotel’s standards and the bathroom is excellent. The hotel is really well located, and we more or less walked everywhere. You can walk to the really nice restaurant district of Born and the beach very easily as well.

The staff were really helpful and couldn’t do enough for you, despite the challenging circumstances all hotels find themselves in at the moment. The rooftop bar is the highlight though, with stunning views across the city, great cocktails and and a great soundtrack. Sitting in the pool and then having drinks up there was a highlight of the holiday. 

We especially enjoyed the rooftop bar’s ‘Instagram corner’ where bored but clearly well trained boyfriends/husbands would take 847 pictures of a partner pouting at various different angles or acrobatic poses. The one woman dance routine on one occasion was a little much though. Maybe we’re just too British.

When things return to normal (please!) we will definitely be back. Strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bit of style and luxury in their holiday. 

Special shout out to the reception staff who were very patient with my Spanish! It made me feel much more competent than I am.",5,2020,08,01
23,Top ten in Barcelona,"Lovely Hotel. It's clean and pacefull. Very good location. Nice staff. I was in Juny last year and the experience was fantasthic, I'm back with the family now, Is still a top ten. 
You can walk arround the area, it's nice and pacefull, too",5,2020,07,25
23,Wonderful hotel,"We had an incredible time here. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel safe and reassure us about Covid and hygiene policies. 

The room was astounding. I’ve never seen such an impressive shower! The bed was huge and the pillows were astonishingly comfy.

The rooftop pool is wonderful.",5,2020,07,10
23,For the rooftop pool,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights here in 2019 summer. 

We came here mainly becoz the a US TV series ""Blind spot"", thats why the 1st thing we did after checkin was going to the rooftop pool with bar had a bottle of champagne. 

The view was super but the pool was smaller than I expected, yet it was still magnificent to take nice selfies with your love one ^^ 

Room was nice, very clean. . Housekeeping superb. Loved the scent of the aromatherapy.

Even staffs were very friendly and but yet not so professional, few things we wre not really happy with.

1.  Rooms were not ready, it was 1.5 hr later than when we should get. 

2. the breakfast was just OKAY , we were there around 9am , it was not late. But bread counter already some dry bread left. Not much choice that we were a bit upset.  

We did complain to the hotel manager, and I have to say they did make up everything. Next morning the buffet was much nicer, so we were happy again. 

Overall, it is still a very nice hotel.  The room was really beautiful that we could stay 2 weeks easily. 

At last, thanks Rafa , he was a really nice guy who always took care of our luggage and my car.",5,2020,06,29
23,A WOW in Barcelona!,"We selected Ohla Barcelona from the Mr. and Mrs. Smith collection because of the hotel's central location and ""boutique-y"" feel. The check-in experience began with cava and chocolate-dipped strawberries - a nice touch. So, too, was the upgrade to the beautifully-appointed Junior corner suite. Everything about Ohla Barcelona went beyond our expectations.",5,2020,03,22
23,Best hotel I’ve stayed in,"This hotel was wonderful. From our greeting with cava and chocolate strawberries we were already won over. The room was wonderful, comfy bed and pillows. Great shower. Excellent lighting. The hosts were wonderful and gifted me two Spanish books when they learned I was studying Spanish. The breakfasts were also excellent. Can’t fault this hotel. And I’m fussy!",5,2020,03,10
23,Fantastic hotel,"Arrived early day one and was offered an upgrade with a glass of Cava at reception and a bottle in the the room. The room was amazing with plenty of space.

The location of the hotel was perfect for us and most popular areas walkable. In fact we took taxi's to Parc Guell and the Montjuic Castle on separate days and walked back to the hotel picking up all the sights, scenes, sounds and smells on way back.

The people, food and drink were fantastic although maybe a little expensive in some areas.

The hotel staff and concierge team were fabulous, very informative and knowledgeable.

We found the Gothic quarter our favourite area (probably because it was next to the hotel) with some great tapas bars.

Will be going again",5,2020,03,08
23,Marvelous experience!!!,"We are very pleased for staying at this hotel. Great room, wonderful staff and good breakfast. The hotel is located near the tube and we walked to get to la rambla, the shopping area. I really recommend this hotel. ",5,2020,03,07
23,Great hotel ,"Stayed here for our honeymoon, we had a free upgrade to a suite and bottle of cava waiting for us upon arrival. Lovely hotel, very clean. Great facilities. Little cold to use the terrace and pool bar but managed it once. Also ate at Caelis restaurant which was fantastic. Staff were great. Breakfast was good and plenty of choice. Brilliant location. Highly recommend! ",5,2020,03,07
23,Excellent stay in a beautiful city ,"Chose this 5 star hotel in the centre of the city to celebrate our daughter’s 21st birthday. 
This was a great choice and we were welcomed with a glass of cava and chocolate dipped strawberries. We were also given a complimentary bottle of cava in each room!
The upgraded design bedroom with open plan bathroom (shower is visible from the bedroom) is stylish and offered a great view of the street below. 
The location is perfect for the Metro (just across the road), the gothic quarter and it’s a 20 minute walk to the marina. 
Breakfast was great and we also had a tapas lunch at the same restaurant - some of the best we had. 
We loved the rooftop bar with great views over the city. ",5,2020,03,02
23,Finest Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In!,"My husband and I visited Barcelona as an early celebration for his upcoming special birthday. From the moment we arrived, and were told that our room was ready for us (much earlier than the official check-in time) we had the most fabulous experience. The room was spotless, the décor beautiful, the breakfasts delicious, and most importantly the staff couldn't do more for their guests. I can genuinely say that this was the best hotel experience I have ever had (and I've stayed in Shangri-La's, Mandarin Orientals etc. etc. Thank you so very much for making our stay so special. We hope to return to Barcelona, and would not dream of staying anywhere else.",5,2020,03,02
23,Standout hotel in a city full of great options,"Amazing time at the Ohla! The hotel is a a standout- beautiful space, great location and service and delicious food. We realized this even more so after we got the lay of the city. You can pretty much walk to all of the main “must see” destinations (Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera) as well as Gothic quarter nightlife, Eixample and even Barceloneta beach. The service is incredible. We rented a car through the hotel which they delivered to us, parked for us and had picked up. The parking was not an extra charge. Albert (manager?) gave us some amazing recommendations of places to go on our day trip to Costa Brava. The breakfast was included in our rate and it was really impressive- something for everyone and they even had mimosas. The roof deck had beautiful views of the city and was a great place to grab a drink and watch the sunset. We had planned to spend the last few days of the trip at the W on Barceloneta beach and wished we had just stayed at the Ohla for the remainder of the trip. In a city with many great hotel options we would return to the Ohla!",5,2020,02,26
23,Thank you ohla and Pablo!,"I stayed here with my mom for 4 nights on our first trip to Spain, and this is the best hotel we’ve ever stayed at. When you check in you’re greeted by lovely staff who make you feel very special and comfortable as well as chocolate covered strawberries and a glass of cava. The rooms are beautiful and everything is clean and modern. The concierge Pablo helped us SO MUCH. He knew all the best restaurants, bars, and clubs that the locals go to and was able to get us tables and spots everywhere! He got us seats at an AMAZING flamenco show, and recommended that we go to Girona (a lovely town outside the city) for a day which was beautiful, definitely a highlight of our trip. (Parts of Game of Thrones was filmed there!!) Pablo even helped us with our train to get there! Our trip definitely would not have been nearly the same without him. We love Ohla and Pablo! Thank you so much for making our trip amazing and stress free!! xo",5,2020,02,18
23,A fabulous city hotel ,"We chose this hotel as part of a BA package and were absolutely delighted with our stay.

From the moment we arrived and checked in everything about the hotel was perfect 

The check in was so personal - including a lovely glass of fizz 

The room - a junior suite - was spacious, clean and equipped with everything we desired 

There is a spectacular view from the rooftop bar - with lovely seating, heaters and rugs supplied for this time of year.

Breakfast - everything we needed

Staff - there to please 

Location - perfect for walking round the centre of Barcelona and beyond 

The decor in the public areas - modern & tasteful. 

We didn’t use the gym or the restaurants in the hotel - but am sure they are of a wonderful standard 

If you are looking for a perfect Barcelona hotel - look no further ",5,2020,02,16
23,The only place to stay in Barcelona,"I have just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona with my partner. I couldn’t have asked for anymore than what Ohla offers. Delicious breakfast, super clean room with everything you could need, perfect nights sleep, outstanding service from everyone working in the hotel: Concierge, check in and check out, waiters and waitresses. 
Rooftop pool and bar was also lovely. My only issue was we didn’t have time to check out the restaurant in the hotel! But we aim to on our next visit! 
I would definitely recommend this hotel. Bliss!",5,2020,02,12
23,Stunning hotel,This Hotel is a very very nice place to stay. The roof top terrace and pool are stunning and the staff at the hotel are impeccable. Pablo from Concierge is the most genuine and kind person and made our stay perfect. The breakfasts are amazing!! Cant wait to go back!!,5,2020,02,05
23,2 nights in Barcelona,"Perfect place to clm down after rash Barcelona things. I really thankful to those, who work in this hotel. The tackled all issues i had: midnight check-in, printing my ticket and etc. What is more, after visiting them I fell in love with bath cosmetics, that is offered in the hotel",5,2020,02,05
23,A great position in Barcelona and really helpful team made a short break a happy break,"We decided on Barcelona as a destination for a four day break. Ohla seemed to be the best for our requirements in terms of position within the city and room quality. They get 10 out of 10 for this. The room was very comfortable and essentially all sights to be seen were in walking distance.
The team at the hotel get 11 out of 10. The concierge team looked after us very well as did the breakfast team - in terms of quality and variation of food as well as looking after any special requests. I would recommend Hotel Ohla without any hesitation.",5,2020,01,25
23,Drink only,"a group of 4 of us popped in here on Xmas eve when we discovered there was a rooftop bar, pootled on up and shared a bottle of cava while enjoying the fantastic view. Very friendly barman from southern Italy provided excellent service.
Well worth a stop if you are passing by.",5,2020,01,08
23,Great holiday experience,".Hotel staff did everything they can to provide perfect hospitality
The location, near the Gothic Quarter is excellent and also easy access to main tourist attractions.
We got much more than we expected!",5,2020,01,05
23,Lovely boutique hotel,"The entrance lobby is small but pleasant. The desk there is actually the concierge desk. Check in was quick and easy. The reception desk is a few stairs up. 
Essential room size is good, enough space. We had requested a twin. A garden view is better as it’s quieter. The bathroom has No door! Awkward! The shower glass panel can be covered with vinyl, on request but this doesn’t solve the no-door issue. The toilet within the bathroom has a door, luckily! 
Complimentary water bottles are provided daily- great! Tea and coffee is standard. But no biscuits! 
Extra bathroom amenities like lip balm! are available on request. 
Concierge is very helpful and provide lots of information. Pablo and Daniel recommended good restaurants- thanks. 
Breakfast has cold meats, cheeses, cereal, pastries. Eggs can be made to order. Fruits are available, but limited in choice, no exotic mangoes or papaya! Brian served very well - thanks! 
Did not try the in-house restaurants. 
The wellness centre is disappointing! No steam room or jacuzzi. Just a sauna. The gym has few equipment but we did not use any. 
The rooftop pool is open in winter but of course too cold to use. 
The staff are all really friendly. 
The stay was comfortable and pleasant. 
The hotel is very central so a lot is within walking distance. The beach is a 15min walk. 
If you like being out and about, stay here.",4,2019,12,29
23,Great hotel for couples,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights.
The room was very clean and spacious. The shower was really nice, but it is suited only for couples, as it is made of transparent glass walls. 
The mattress was not the best, very bouncy.
The breakfast is really good and has nice variety, although I wish it had more vegetables.
The staff are also very nice and helpful.
The best thing in the hotel for us was the location, close to public transportation and to many attraction by foot.
bottom line, very recommended for couples(at least in the room we stayed)   ",5,2019,12,26
23,Wonderful,"From the moment we walked in the door we knew we had hit the jackpot with the hotel we selected for our break in Barcelona. Check in was sophisticated with offer of cava and chocolate dipped strawberries whilst they were processing our check in. We were escorted to our room which was a beautiful suite on the 5th floor. We had breakfast included which was very tasty with buffet items as well as being able to order eggs anyway. The staff were fantastic. On our first night we ordered room service which consisted of oysters and croquettes- delicious. Dinner at Caelis was superb- our favourite meal of our trip. Concierge staff couldn’t be more helpful, making excellent recommendations for shopping and local eateries. The room itself was modern but cosy. The deep bath was very relaxing with the excellent bath products making the whole room smell delightful. We slept incredibly well and wished we didn’t have to leave. Garcias hotel Ohla!",5,2019,12,17
23,A great place to stay in a great city.,"We had a memorable but short stay at the Ohla, celebrating birthdays for 2 family members.  The arrival and check-in process was seamless and we were immediately made to feel welcome by staff who were friendly and engaged.  The rooms were excellent (clean and well appointed) and we liked the unusual design.  The concierge team was outstanding: we had some fantastic recommendations from them, one of which resulted in our enjoying an excellent meal at a local restaurant we would probably have walked past in other circumstances.  Excellent breakfast, but we did not try the hotel's Michelin star restaurant because of time.  The location is perfect for visiting Barcelona.  My wife and I quickly agreed that the Ohla is a hotel we would happliy return to, and we are already making plans for our next visit.",5,2019,12,10
23,Stay too short,"We booked into Hotel Ohla for 1 night, prior to going aboard a cruise ship which left the following day. That was a mistake we won't do again. Never having been to Barcelona before, we were unsure how much time to spend there. Well now we know. From the moment we were personally checked in, which included a detailed account of the features of the hotel to the time we departed, we were treated with courtesy & high measure of professionalism. Centrally located on the Via Laietana and not far from Catalunya Place, this hotel should be on your short list if you intend staying in Barcelona. Our room was a design deluxe on a corner with 2 areas separated by a 3 or 4 stairs. Very comfortable, clean & modern. Our evening meal was in the La Plassohla restaurant in the hotel which served excellent tapas. Altogether a wonderful stay. Forgot to mention the rooftop terrace which has a magnificent view over Barcelona. It was a little too cold when we stayed.
Be sure that you book the right Hotel Ohla as there is also the Hotel Ohla Eixample, Corsega, 289, Barcelona.",5,2019,12,09
23,Wonderful stay,"This is a beautiful boutique hotel that offers wonderful service, very comfortable rooms and an amazing Michelin star restaurant.  My wife and I stayed here celebrating 20 years together and our first holiday away without the children.  It is the perfect place to stay in the Gothic quarter and is close to everything.  The rooftop pool and bar are not to be missed.  Highly recommended and would definitely stay again.",5,2019,12,06
23,Totally 5 Star Experience At Every Level Plus The Hotel Is Cool,"I was working in London and needed a 4 day break and I jumped on a flight to Barcelona and found this hotel and while I have stayed in some great hotels this year by a mile this hotel has found that elusive quality where they get everything right.  Let's face it the first thing that sets a place apart is the staff and the staff here at every level provides the best service anyone could expect or ask for.  I booked a Jr Suite which was well worth the extra cost.  The rooftop deck had a bar, food, views oh and did I mention the pool, Wow.  I had great help from the management coordinating my arrival and getting my rewards points allocated properly, very high marks for the management team but literally every staff member from housekeeping to restaurant to Front Desk treated me like a dear friend.  I have been coming to Barcelona well over 40 years but this trip opened me up to a new level of enjoyment and I really love this hotel, hell I would come back to Barcelona just to stay at this hotel.  The 4 days flew by, this is the perfect neighborhood and I found a yoga place and I would walk down to the water every day (it's about a mile from the hotel).  This is not just a hotel this is a place in Barcelona to see and be seen, totally hip and cool but not aloof, I am an old guy and everyone made me feel like one of the group.  Perfect stay for me and a break from London I really needed.  I thank the management team and the entire staff for my wonderful 4 days.",5,2019,12,01
23,Spectacular Experience,"We had such an amazing experience from the start. Being checked in and treated with local Cava. Jasper giving us a tour of our room/ hotel and making us feel at home.

Great outdoor, rooftop bar with stunning views. Perfect location. Steps away from Gothic Quarter and some awesome local eateries. 

Very clean. Felt very safe. Staff friendly and professional. Housekeeping superb. Loved the scent of the aromatherapy.

At the end of our stay, we were granted an extension of the room for a fee til 5pm which we were grateful for as our flight was late.

From someone that lives in Metropolitan area in the US, it exceeded both my husband and my expectations. Will definitely be recommending to friends and family.",5,2019,11,30
23,Great experience overall,"The room was clean and cozy. Mostly recommend for couples.

23,Great Stay - Thank-you,"Had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Ohla with my Fiancée Maya who was in Barcelona during a work trip.
The staff were very engaging and attentive without being to forward.
The Buffet Breakfast was always well presented and tasty, the room very clean and well maintained.
The morning staff were always polite and friendly even at 6.30am.
We were very lucky to be upgraded to the Suite Dome the GM Javier Rueda, - it was fantastic. Stunning suite with even better views. 
Glorious views from the swimming pool area if you stay when the weather is nice enough to enjoy them.
Total enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Hotel, which is very well positioned in the centre of the city. 
Loved it!!",5,2019,11,22

23,A great 5 star experience,This beautiful hotel has a friendly and great staff. It is a super clean and well maintained location. There are multiple excellent places to eat and drink including a rooftop bar for tapas and drinks with fantastic views. The breakfast is well worth getting and an excellent start to the day.

23,We will come back!,"Love our stay at Ohla. It is a 5-star hotel with intimate atmosphere.  Great location, service and staff!  Service and staff are amazing...they really take care of you. 
Caelis is well deserved a Michelin Star.  Everything is just perfect.  We are in the middle of everything and the noise level is very low... almost none.  We will come back for sure, maybe booking a more expensive room. :p  I recommend anyone to stay here. BTW, massage is fantastic as well.",5,2019,11,14
23,"Classy, quirky and the warmest of welcomes","We booked the Ohla Barcelona as a treat for our 25th wedding anniversary. It was a fantastic choice, brilliantly positioned, beautifully appointed and with the most amazing rooftop bar! From the moment we arrived we felt special with the warmest of welcomes from Rafa who ushered us up for a glass of cava while we checked in with Chloe. The hotel also kindly left us a very thoughtful note and gift in acknowledgement of our anniversary which was much appreciated.

The room was beautiful. Modern and quirky, top quality fixtures and products used throughout. And utterly spotless. 

And the bar... Wow. Loved sipping a cold drink looking out over the Barcelona skyline. Blankets offered, lighting perfect and super friendly and efficient table service. What I wouldn't give to pop round again tonight! 

Thank you for a memorable stay to all the staff of the Ohla Barcelona.",5,2019,11,04
23,Great hotel!,"Being my first trip to Barcelona and not knowing the layout of the city well I could not have been more satisfied with our decision for staying at Ohla Barcelona. The Neighborhood is beautiful and we were able to walk everywhere! The staff was super friendly, rooms were very clean and nice, and by far the best breakfast I have every had staying at hotel. During down time we spent most of our time relaxing on the beautiful roof top! Overall highly recommend.",5,2019,11,04
23,Perfect in every way,"This was our first time in Barcelona. We were here to celebrate my 30th birthday. Ohla hotel made this weekend unforgettable. The staff, the room, the extra touches, the food were absolutely amazing. It really is the perfect place to stay in Barcelona. I can not thank this hotel enough for making this weekend perfect, I wanted to make memories that I could think about in years to come barcelona is beautiful and ohla helped to make this weekend everything i imagined it would be. 
Thank you",5,2019,11,04
23,Great location and excellent staff,This is a beautiful hotel centrally located so you can walk to many attractions.  The rooms were modern and gorgeous.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurants were all very nice and the view on the rooftop was breathtaking.  We had a wonderful time.,5,2019,10,28
23,"Good hotel, good location","Stayed in this hotel for 3 days. Room was not huge but comfortable, elevators small, check in is in second floor and not a smooth process. Staff is nice and helpful. 

Breakfast available each morning on attached restaurant, service is slow in restaurant. 

Location is good, easy walk to Gotic area and main shopping area. Mike walk to Sagruda Familia and easy 1/2 mile to Arch du triumph area and train station. Cabs easy to find next to hotel as well. 

Overall a decent hotel ",3,2019,10,27
23,Stay here you won't regret it!,"We were blown away with the service and major attention to detail. They allowed us to check-in 3 hours early which we really appreciated as our ship docked at 7 am that same day. 

Breakfast was amazing, lots of selection. 

The location couldn't be better. Our bed was really comfortable.The roof top patio is a great place to chill for a few hours.

We will be back!",5,2019,10,25
23,A 5* hotel with 5* staff and service,"We were treated like royalty during our stay.  The rooms, food and service were all excellent, with attention to every detail.  The hotel is well situated for the sites and the beach too.  When we return to Barcelona we will be coming back to this hotel as we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else - thank you for making our stay simply the best!",5,2019,10,25
23,Great Hotel for a sightseeing trip of Barceloa,"The hotel and staff are definitely 5 Star.  So attentive and helpful, pointing you in the right direction.  The Barman was great and knew a few secret restaurants that made our trip even more special - highly recommended it would be hard to beat",5,2019,10,23
23,Albert and Louis are awesome ,We so enjoyed our stay. Albert was fantastic helping see the sights and getting tickets for us. His knowledge of the city and professionalism are beyond compare.  Louis was ever the gentleman and represented the hotel with courtesy and dedication. He made us feel right at home!,5,2019,10,20
23,WELCOMING HOSPITALITY.,"5* Welcome with  cava and chocolate dipped strawberries on arrival. Our suite was well equipped with high end shower products, nespresso machine, a bottle of complimentary cava and chocolates plus turn down service. The roof top bar and pool is a great place to relax and enjoy the views over Barcelona's landmarks. Breakfast was a buffet style of service, again everything provided for. This hotel seems to have every aspect of hospitality spot on and deserves its 5 star rating. Word of warning though check if the demonstrations  are on-going as it was rapidly growing momentum as we were leaving!",5,2019,10,18
23,Outstanding hotel,"Recently spent three nights at this hotel and couldn’t fault it. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Our room was lovely and well equipped. Great roof terrace and pool and breakfast was great. Situated in a good location, surrounded by restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,10,17
23,Very Nice Hotel,We were here last minute and were lucky to find a room here. The staff was welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast buffet was included with our room and had a variety of choices. In addition they will make eggs or omelettes cooked to order. The rooms were clean and comfortable although I will note the king bed was 2 singles pushed together not the first place on this trip where that has happened. The rooftop pool and bar was beautiful with views of the city. ,4,2019,10,16
23,All round excellent!,"Great hotel, staff were fantastic and the concierge was so knowledgeable and helpful.  Beautiful room and great location to walk everywhere.  We booked into Cialis (Mitchelin starred, in house restaurant) which was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had!",5,2019,10,14
23,One of the best,"We stayed at the hotel 2 nights . It was a wonderful experience. Staff went out of their way to accommodate. Top service hotel. The breakfast was delicious and hotel decor is very modern. The location is great. We highly recommend this gem in Barcelona.
          Pat and Jay Krouse",5,2019,10,11
23,Great central hotel,"We stayed here for 4 days, and loved the hotel.  The staff were great, the concierge was able to get us tickets to a Barcelona soccer game.  The staff were all exceptionally friendly.  The breakfast was in their restaurant and had lot to chose from.  The rooftop bar was a really nice place to relax and have a great view of the city.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,08
23,Great hospitality ,"Truly a 5 star hotel with great location within walking distance to most attractions and La Ramblas. We were warmly welcomed at checkin and given a great hospitality experience throughout our trip. We stayed here 4 nights and enjoyed the breakfast buffet downstairs. Breakfast is served during 7-11am, it does get a little crazy after 9am so I would suggest going early. I wanted to send a postcard to my family and the staff at concierge was kind enough to post it for me. Great experience over all. Highly recommended ",5,2019,10,06
23,Modern Hotel with Old World Service,"Hotel Ohla was a great experience.  The check in experience is very gracious, complete with a warm welcome with cold cava.  The rooms are very modern.  The glass shower is fine for a couple, but not appropriate if traveling with friends or kids!  We thought the location and rooftop bar were two of the best features of the hotel.  The bar has a beautiful view of the cathedral and we were able to walk to many of our key destinations, and come back to relax with the wonderful view.  We ate dinner at the tapas restaurant on site and enjoyed every course.  The same room is used for breakfast which has a nice buffet in the morning.  I would recommend the hotel and would certainly come back next time in Barcelona.",5,2019,10,03
23,"Amazing service, great location","Literally my new favorite hotel (I'm usually a Ritz person, but this was the perfect combo of *nice* but also really friendly and welcoming).

The property is beautiful, the location is safe and very central, and the service was impeccable. The roof deck view, drinks, and food were fabulous. I almost didn't want to explore the city because the hotel was a haven from the madness.",5,2019,10,03
23,Fabulous property,"This hotel was wonderful. Our room was comfortable and attractive and the location of the property was fabulous. The staff was kind, attentive and helpful . We will stay there again! The rooftop bar and restaurant were both enjoyable and had a lovely selection of tapas and great wine.",5,2019,09,29
23,A Gem of a Hotel,"From the moment we entered Ohla Hotel, the staff could not have been any more welcoming and helpful.  This is a five-star hotel and everything about it makes it five star!  Upon arrival, the concierge offered us a free upgrade from an ""essential"" room to a deluxe room and a 20% coupon for the restaurant called La Plassohla.  The room was unique with a glass enclosed shower in the center of the bathroom with a hidden toilet behind a door.  While in the room, the doorbell rang and a staff member delivered a bottle of champaign to welcome us.
We did go to the restaurant for dinner where I had the best muscles I have ever had!  Breakfast was also very special.  A highlight of the hotel for me is the lovely pool they have on their rooftop.  While swimming laps, you can view the tops of buildings in this Gothic section of Barcelona.  Everything was perfect!  Thank you to the management of this great hotel!!",5,2019,09,29
23,Kari J.,"Great location.  Close to attractions, waterfront, shops and restaurants. 
Breakfast was more than I expected. Had American type breakfast, you can order other breakfast food not on the buffet.
Concierge service is excellent. 
I would stay here again.",5,2019,09,27
23,Anniversary,"If I could give 6 stars I would. This hotel by itself is enough of a reason to visit Barcelona Impeccable cleanliness, Magical Rooftop and great hospitality. We were welcomed with a bottle of champagne in our room. The only thing that could of made it better was if someone would share the rooftop playlist—it was awesome😀",5,2019,09,18
23,Great base for a city break,"We loved everything about this hotel. The location was absolutely perfect for all of the attractions in Barcelona, we didn't use any public transport once as was just able to walk everywhere. It's right at the heart of everything but when you're in your room or at the rooftop pool it feels like you're away from it all. 
The guys on the front desk are always helping with advise of where to go if we needed any help and housekeeping really friendly. 
The rooftop pool is a great place to relax after a day of sightseeing and the drinks although on the expensive side are really good and you can stay in the pool until 7pm. 
I read a few complaints about the breakfast before visiting, but we found it had everything we wanted and they're happy to make you eggs or coffee if you ask for it. 
We stayed in a design room and it was a good size and had everything you needed in it, and the glass of cava on check in was very welcome. 
I'd recommended staying here if you're looking for somewhere luxurious and at the heart of it all. We'd stay here again when we next visit Barcelona.",5,2019,09,17
23,"Great location, great hotel!","I have just returned from Barcelona and had to write a review on this amazing hotel. From the minute you arrive until the minute you check out you are made to feel at home. All the staff are friendly and approachable and are readily available to help if needed. I have to give a special mention to Ever who helped arrange airport transportation.
The rooms were great and the welcome bottle of Cava was a nice touch. Air con was easy to control, the hairdryer was great for a hotel hairdryer, the complimentary water refilled every day was nice. 
The breakfast was good, I am really fussy when it comes to breakfast. 
The rooftop bar/ pool area was a lovely space to relax with great views. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here if I return to the lovely city of Barcelona! ",5,2019,09,16
23,Recommend +++,"My husband and I stayed on 9th Sept for 1 evening for our wedding anniversary. From the moment we entered to the time we left we were treated so well. The staff are so welcoming and friendly. Everyone bent over backwards to make our stay and anniversary really special. 
The check inn process is amazing, like Ive never experienced before, they take you to a seperate floor and you are sat in your own private area whilst your details are being checked. All made nicer with champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries! I said to my husband I feel like I'm at a meeting at a grand bank managers office! It was fabulous!
Thank you again Ohla Barcelona for your efforts. We wished we could of stayed longer. Best Wishes Carolyn and Alan from Newcastle UK",5,2019,09,15
23,Definitely recommend,"Very convenient location, surrounded by lots of restaurants and bars and La rambla if that’s where you want to go. Lovely rooms, good breakfast, wonderful concierge with helpful local tips, rooftop bar fabulous day or night. No hesitation in recommending or staying again",5,2019,09,14
23,Loved this hotel,"This hotel is very attractive and it's well located in the heart of everything and I mean everything.  2 mini supermarkets across the street, the hop on and hop off bus a 3 minute walk to first stop to buy tickets.  The main expensive shopping street is a 3 minute walk the other way.  Great rooms and great service.  Love it.",5,2019,09,09
23,Luxurious but... ,"Really good service and nice rooms but a little bit small even if for the suite. The swimming pool is fantastic, great view, nice cocktail . Really good location. The breakfast is OK, maybe not the level of a 5 stars",5,2019,09,08
23,Fabulous Hotel Experience,"This hotel deserves the highest rating possible, in every aspect. Their gracious check in, with a very personal style complete with Prosecco, was efficient and quick. The concierge helped us find the most wonderful restaurants, aiming them to exactly the type of food we wanted for that evening. The hotel itself is eclectic, charming and comfortable. We were on the 6th floor, with a view of the city. The room was comfortable and immaculate. The top floor is a rooftop bar with a pool and amazing views. We loved spending time there between touring the city. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, perfectly located in the city, for a visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,09,06
23,Fabulous hotel with amazing rooftop in good location,"The hotel has a quirky decor of ""eyes"" which makes it quite fun, but the main features are the fabulous views from the rooftop - highly recommended for sunset drinks - where there's a swimming pool too, the friendly staff and good location, close to everything.
Very spacious room with all comfort, large shower and open bathroom and the toilet behind a secret door.
At check in I was offered a glass of Cava and they explained all that was available for me, included the Michelin starred restaurant (which sadly I could not try).
Breakfast was included and very good.",5,2019,09,02
23,Amazing roof terrace and pool,"We stayed in August for a long weekend with friends.  We couldn't fault anything from the location to the hotel facilities and customer service.  The wow factor was definitely the roof terrace on the 8th floor with and amazing pool. Great music which gave the place a very relaxed atmosphere.
We decided to go for a slightly bigger room which had a glass shower in the centre of the room, which was certainly different!  Coffee and water replaced every day.
Breakfast was lovely with a selection of everything you would normally get on a breakfast buffet but with the added touch of ordering cappuccino if filter coffee is not your thing.  Cava also available which was a nice touch.
Hotel staff were friendly and knowledgeable providing good recommendations for dinner and bus tour etc.
Being in the heart of the gothic area meant we were close by all of the squares and only a few minutes from Barcelona Cathedral and a couple of streets away from Le Rambla where you can take a walk down to the marina/post and beaches.
Would highly recommend this hotel and hope to visit again.",5,2019,09,01
23,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location","We stayed here for 4 nights in a Junior Suite.
The hotel and room are beautiful. The rooftop bar and pool are a super nice place to hang out.
The location is perfect - we walked everywhere easily. 
When we arrived, the concierge and front desk staff were super friendly and helpful.
We arrived before our room was ready, and they allowed us to use the showers n the gym to freshen up after our long travel day.
When our room was finally ready, the front desk seemed a bit overwhelmed and rushed. 
The breakfast buffet was average.",4,2019,08,31
23,Amazing!,We had an absolutely wonderful time at hotel Ohla Barcelona. The location is great and close to everything. The rooftop bar has a spectacular view and the wine bar downstairs had a great selection of wine. The server made us a special wine tasting along with some amazing complementary cheese. When we go back to Barcelona we will definitely stay here and will also recommend to friends and family!,5,2019,08,28
23,Ideal location coupled with attentive service,"We were greeted with smiling faces from the moment of check-in. The staff are eager to welcome you, and to attend to any queries you may have about the hotel itself or Barcelona in general. Check-in itself was friendly, with coffee and a few chocolates offered while sitting across from the check-in personnel (which a welcome change from the ubiquitous standing check-in at almost every other hotel chain).  Rooms are clean and perfect size for a couple seeking a relaxing getaway, with simple and modern design. The view we had was of the main avenue that the hotel borders, which, with its gothic designed buildings lining the street, was quite charming (we heard practically no noise coming in from the outside, so we simply enjoyed the view). Breakfast is offered from 7-10 AM and, while not expansive, had enough variety to make for a good experience. The rooftop bar is ideal in the evening for a drink and to enjoy the view. Drinks were on the expensive side though. 

As far as location, the hotel is ideally placed. Close to the sea, but not directly bordering it, with a plethora of charming side streets to wander and enjoy the history and modern highlights of Barcelona. 

Overall, I highly recommend the hotel for location, room quality, and friendly service by all staff encountered.",5,2019,08,28
23,Best hotel experience i've ever had,"I stayed at both the Ohla Barcelona, and their sister property the Ohla Eixample. The concierge staff, reception staff, bar staff, and housekeeping were all outstanding. I would emphatically recommend these properties to anyone visiting Barcelona. We didn't want to leave the hotel to explore because it was so luxurious. Cava upon arrival, turn down service, and attentive and prompt concierge ready to service your every need. Stop looking, and start booking- you won't regret it!!",5,2019,08,27
23,perfection,"Without doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Wonderful rooftop bar, welcome staff perfect - offered champagne and strawberries - welcome give of bubbly too.  The rooms are immaculate and serviced twice a day.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone",5,2019,08,27
23,location location,This a quirky hotel ideally placed within easy walking distance of both La Sagrada Familia and La Rambla .The tiny lift is a bit of a drawback and the stairs are quite steep but fortunately we were on the first floor . We made the trek to the eighth floor to see the rooftop pool which was not large and it was quite windy . We were fortunate enough to see an aspiring model having a photo shoot which made the trek worthwhile .,5,2019,08,26
23,Good location,"Good location and nice rooftop bar and pool.
Bedrooms very basic and mattress was like a rock - not what I would expect from a 5star hotel.
Breakfast ok. Staff polite. 
Overall I personally think it is overpriced for what you get.",3,2019,08,24
23,Receptionist Worst Experience,"Walked into level 0 (not the hotel reception) with two other people, who could've been prospective guests.

At first Daniel was on the phone & completely ignored us - then as soon as we pressed the elevator button to go up to another marked ""hotel reception"" to enquire about the rooftop bar and pool (not staying there as guests), he shouted “where are you going” and demanded the other two ladies left as he assumed they were not guests, and only wanted to go to the rooftop bar which opened at 7pm.
We then waited for him to get off the phone (Again) to ask him our question and he completely ignored us, serving 3 other groups of people who came into the lobby (2 groups also not staying at the hotel or using the restaurant).
We then decided to take the stairs to level 0.5 reception to ask our question to someone who might be more respectful. 

As soon as we approached the staircase, he raised his voice to at us in Spanish (as English speakers and due to other people in the lobby we had no idea he was talking to us until he stormed up the stairs after us. 
He said very rude things and completely judged us before we could even ask the question which we had waited for at least 10 minutes to ask him. 
He was extremely rude and said things like; “Look at the price of the room see if you can afford it”  and “You would not be a guest here, you don’t look like a guest here”. These were very extreme assumptions to make, and severely disrespectful. 

He should have been more considerate about what his clientele might be and as there are so many different facilities in the building he wouldn’t know what information we needed unless he had asked us. 
He didn't ask us anything other than interrupt and assume when we were trying to get our question across. We read great reviews on this Hotel and the experience here, but Daniel made it very difficult for us to feel comfortable to come back when the rooftop was open. 

Would not recommend walking through the ground floor reception if you can help it, to avoid a very disrespectful experience.
Experience at 16/08/2019 at around 15:30pm.",1,2019,08,23
23,Perfectly appointed property for a luxury Barcelona experience,"Right on the edge of several neighborhoods and on top of a metro line you can't get a better location. The arrival experience with the personal escort from door to check in to room along with glass of cava really set the tone and didn't disappoint!  

The rooftop pool is amazing. All of the staff is SOOOO helpful. The food and drink are delicious and the rooms are well appointed. I suggest this hotel for couples or singles traveling. The shower is a glass box in the middle of the room so no privacy there. But it was a nice touch to keeping the room open and bright. I wish my stay was longer because I could have really settled in. ",5,2019,08,20
23,"Luxurious, friendly hotel in central Barcelona","Absolutely superb stay for our wedding anniversary. Luxurious hotel in a very central position near the cathedral meaning that you can walk to most of the sights and restaurants. Very special rooftop bar with swimming pool. Super friendly, welcoming and professional staff with a special mention for Albert, the head concierge. Amazing breakfast. Beautiful, stylish room. Decent gym. Highly recommended.",5,2019,08,20
23,Great Location,"This is a smallish boutique hotel that is in a great central location near to
The shops, the old town ,cathedral and las Rambla.
You can walk all over Barcelona from here from the port to the top end of the city centre.  It’s next to a tube station and on the bus routes.
As a boutique hotel the decor is dark and the furniture minimalist but not unpleasant.
All the staff were very friendly and helpful.
One point of caution is do get a room on a higher floor as the underground runs under the hotel.",4,2019,08,19
23,Amazing!!,"The hotel was absolutely amazing. We enjoyed our stay very much. The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. The hotel is central, all sights can be reached quickly on foot. Thanks to Ohla Barcelona! :-) ",5,2019,08,19
23,"Great Location, Great Staff, Great Hotel","Amazing hotel in a fantastic location. The staff were especially friendly and helpful at all times from the reception when we first arrived, to the porters and cleaning staff, the concierge services and the restaurant - all were brilliant and made us feel very welcome. The location is near to all the sights in the gothic quarter. The rooftop pool was lovely and sipping evening cocktails there watching the sun go down on the busy city below will be a memory to cherish.",5,2019,08,18
23,A good find,"On looking for a hotel in Barcelona for a few nights we came across Ohla and thought it looked pretty central and had a bit more to offer than some of the hotels listed. It was very central taking about 30 minutes to walk to the port and beach and close to markets (Las Ramblas) and all the tourist spots.
Rooftop pool, nice but a lot smaller than we thought, good photography when taking their pictures for advertising. No sun loungers so sunbathing is a bit uncomfortable and if busy only bar stools to sit on.
The hotel has a Michelin Star Restaurant (Caelis) which is a must while you are there, a real bonus to be staying in the hotel so not far to walk.
We had a junior suite on the 6th floor but we were beneath the rooftop bar so could hear chairs being moved constantly day and night which is a bit annoying when you are trying to sleep.
The alcohol in the hotel is at least 30% more than outside in local bars and restaurants, a gin and tonic is €16 and a half a beer is €6 - a pint is €7.10 in most restaurants. This could explain why the winebar in the downstairs of the hotel is usually empty.
The staff are very friendly and the concierge very helpful for arranging restaurant bookings etc.
We would stay again due to location and friendly staff.
",4,2019,08,16
23,Amazing Hotel In Barcelona,"We spent 4 amazing nights at Hotel Ohla in Barcelona.  We felt welcome from the moment we entered the doors.  The hotel is in the perfect part of town, we could walk to nearby restaurants, bars, and shopping and it was close to transportation. The hotel staff gave us great recommendations and advice.  Our room overlooked the beautiful city and the rooftop bar was magnificent at sunset!  Breakfast was a perfect start to every morning.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Ohla and can’t wait to return!  Thank you",5,2019,08,15
23,Perfect location and staff👌🏻,"Its my first visit to Barcelona and i really like the city.this hotel is in the heart of every where in the city..
I can walk to anywhere i want in just few steps.
The staff is amazing.
The concierge Daniele was very helpful. He recommended the restaurants and the places that i should visit either at day time or night and also helped me on booking my flight ticket to london.
Concierge Albert also helped me a lot and when he knew it was my birthday he served me champagne and chocolate strawberry as a complement.
He also did some booking for me for different places.
The best housekeeping ever was the lady who clean my room.
She is amazing. The room is very clean and she put chocolates twice a day🍫.my clothes are always tidy and every thing was perfect.the room interior is beautiful inreally like it.
I highly recommend this hotel to everyone.
And Im definitely coming back on October 💕

23,Exceptional Experience!!,"Our stay at Hotel Ohla Barcelona was excellent.  The service from the staff (every single one of them) was incredible, breakfast was delicious, and location was perfect (just walking distance to restaurants, shops, markets, etc). My celebrated our anniversary here and we are so glad that we did - the experience was exceptional!!!",5,2019,08,14
23,A faultless stay,"My partner and I visited for a 3 night break and found our stay to be faultless. The room was spacious, well equipped and beautifully decorated. The breakfast buffet offered a great choice. Staff were attentive and check in was smooth. To be greeted with a glass of cava and chocolate strawberry made the experience very special. The roof top pool is relaxed and never crowded and the views across the city are spectacular. The location is great for walking to La Ramblas and is within easy reach of all the main tourist districts of the city. With a metro station directly across the street connections to transport could not be easier. 

All in all, a 5* stay.",5,2019,08,13
23,A beautiful Birthday Welcome 🙏 ,"We were very warmly welcomed by Albert at the entrance,a lovely man, who clearly loves meeting people, who despite our early arrival made us feel very welcome and helped us into the lift to 05 to register... the cool air and 💺 comforting seats plus a glass of local sparkling wine, was very heart warming...not only did registration go well, but we had a room 612 available overlooking the rooftops...very comfortable and beautifully situated within walking distance from the main square where we just hopped off a bus from the airport for 5,90 € with comfortable seats and AC.The Hotel is really an avant-gardiste in style and taste...We were welcomed in our room with a bottle of Cava,sparkling wine..The rooftop housed a lovely bar with comfortable sun bathing seats and a see through Splash in swimming pool,which is all lit up at night, quite pretty 👌Breakfast was a real treat with Ana , a charming lady, who rules her team in the pure interest of the Hotel’s guests, making sure each one sits where they desire and makes sure that your special requests are met with panache 👌Being a vegan,I enjoyed their well supplied fruit bar and Ana was so kind to have her kitchen chef prepare me a lovely salad 🥗 each morning 🙏🙏🙏Thanks Ana.We also enjoyed their home gym and Spa with a sauna after training and shower 🚿 with all the luxury soaps and creams and comforting loungers to cool off and relax...I will come back to this charming Ohla on my next trip to Barcelona and highly recommend this Beautiful Hotel 🙏",5,2019,08,12
23,Amazing!!!,"I strongly recommend this hotel for your next stay in Barcelona.
Staff is extremely nice and helpful and hotel is really well located.
Very clean hotel, everything was perfect! 
I would only suggest not taking the breakfast included, food wasn’t very good and mostly cold. You can find breakfast restaurants few blocks away!",5,2019,08,11
23,Fab weekend break! ,"We stayed for 3 nights in August in a first floor room at the front of the building. The hotel is modern and spotlessly clean, our room was split level and spacious with really good aircon. The staff in all areas were very helpful and friendly. Buffet breakfast was good with fruit, breads, eggs and meats as well as fresh juices / coffee. Rooftop pool is a lovely area with fab views over the city, great facility to have - the bar is very expensive but to be expected for a rooftop. There is also a small gym on first floor level. Excellent location within a short walking distance to restaurants, shops, bars and attractions.",5,2019,08,07
23,Birthday Weekend Away,"Can’t praise this hotel enough! From the moment you step foot in the front door they are happy to help! Luggage taken to reception and a nice cold glass of bubbles while you wait to check in. I worried as we had our 18 month old with us but the staff were so friendly and always made a bee line for my son making him smile and wave. 
Food beautiful, staff very friendly and polite. Room was cleaned to high standard everyday. All in all we all loved our stay! Just perfect, thank you! :) ",5,2019,07,26
23,"Excellent Hotel in all aspects; location, staff, hospitality and appointments.","It was our first visit to Barcelona so we arranged (before we left Australia) for a Hotel car to pick us up at the Airport. This was propitious as we waited hours at the Airport to get through a totally inadequate Immigration Service, eventually found our luggage set aside with others still waiting to emerge from the queues, and met our driver who similarly had been waiting. Others we spoke to later (from other Hotels) had not been so fortunate as their drivers had given up and left. Top marks to the Ohla. When we arrived at the Hotel we were given a warm welcome, shown to the first floor Reception where a cold glass of Cava was offered. We were checked in quickly and informed that our room would not be available until 3.00pm. Alternatives were provided (along with a map) to fill in the time. This was when we realised the great location of the Ohla, right on the edge of the Gothic part of the City. This was to prove  a great bonus in the ensuing days. Our room was excellent; it was especially well appointed and the mark of a good Hotel is the bathroom and this was excellent with the Bushman's shower a highlight. The Hotel has great food outlets including the Michelin starred Caelis Restaurant. The Cafe was most inviting ; we often enjoyed a coffee; breakfast presented an excellent buffet. The staff throughout the Hotel was friendly and efficient in their tasks. Any return to Barcelona will see us back in the Ohla.",5,2019,07,26
23,"Beautiful location, beautiful Hotel","Modern hotel with modern amenities in a classical building . Excellent service, from bell captain, to check in, to concierge service. There are two attractive bar and restaurant, in the hotel.
As you step out of the Hotel, you are in the middle of Barcelona life, things to see, walks to take down the nearby Ramblas, restaurants, shops, and museums, a beautiful Gaudi building across the street,",5,2019,07,24
23,Amazing short break in such a cool hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Hotel Ohla for my wife's birthday.  The hotel was superb from the moment we arrived to the minute we (unfortunately) had to leave.  All staff were friendly and approachable, with the cleanliness and comfort of the room exceptional, and our favourite part being the rooftop pool and terrace.  We had evening drinks on the terrace with the relaxed atmosphere and stunning views in the evening sunshine on both days.  If we could arrange to come more often we would, it's been 7 years since our previous visit, but it won't be that long again next time.",5,2019,07,24
23,Our trip to Spain 2019,"We were very glad we chose Ohla in the Gothic neighborhood.  It’s location is perfect, close to most of the tourist sights in Barcelona.  The room was large and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and the concierge service was very knowledgeable and professional! I definitely recommend this great hotel.",5,2019,07,16
23,Nice Hotel,Service was excellent.  The rooms were modern.  We ate at Caelis Restaurant and have decided that the Ohla and Caelis are definite return visits on our next trip.  The complementary breakfast was way above average with pastries that tasted fresh from the bakery and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The hotel is just a short walk away form shopping in Barcelona's famous  alleys.,5,2019,07,13
23,Lovely introduction to Barccelona!,"Wonderful, friendly, helpful and welcoming staff.  Lovely room, comfortable bed and good breakfast. Good communication with staff before we arrived.  We arrived early in the morning, but were allowed to shower and use the spa amenities which helped a lot!We were also spoiled with a bottle of Cava - thanks1",5,2019,07,08
23,Excellent Location Spacious Room Great Staff,"Perfect location for exploring downtown and uptown Barcelona on foot.  Spacious rooms with whisper quiet air conditioning rooftop deck with bar and pool good restaurants on site (even though there are probably 100 good restaurants within 15 minute walk of the hotel).  Service was crisp the breakfast buffet was good standard European fare.  Don't know why we would stay anywhere else, we will be back to both Barcelona and this hotel",5,2019,07,05
23,Hotel,Hotel Ohla Barcelona was amazing! Beautiful room - with plenty of space and modern facilities- fantastic views from your room. Roof top pool and bar had perfect views! Excellent service and great location ,5,2019,07,03
23,"PERFECT LOCATION, SPACIOUS ELEGANT ROOM, AND WONDERFUL STAFF!!!","The Hotel Ohla is a fabulous choice when visiting Barcelona!  First of all, the location is prime.  You are nestled between the top tourist areas--all walking distance--but still feel like you are part of the local vibe of the city.  The rooms are spacious (we treated ourselves to a suite and well worth the expense!), great bath products, super comfortable bed, and gorgeous light.  The breakfast is very generous and has both healthy options and delicious baked goods that you need to treat yourself to on vacation!  Most of all, the management was wonderful.  It was my husband's 50th birthday, and they made sure to surprise us with a bottle of Cava upon arrival.   This was my second trip to Barcelona--the city is among my absolute favorite in Europe--and absolutely would stay here again.",5,2019,06,28
23,Perfect Hospitality ,"We spent almost a week here over MotoGP week. Really professional and super friendly staff. Well located, we were able to walk everywhere without hassle. So many things to do in the area.
Ohla Hotel, THANK You for an amazing experience, we’ll be back.",5,2019,06,27
23,"Sleek, modern, helpful staff.","If you are after something a bit different, modern with unique design this might be for you.   It’s quite dark, all black and white, perhaps not personally my favourite decor but others will really love it.  Good location, rooms are good, staff very helpful, especially the lovely Albert.  We were really happy with breakfast. 
The pool is nice for a swim.  The sitting area isn’t amazing (although the view is great) and it felt really hot up there with little shade when we first arrived.  The sun moves though and we found some shade.  So all in all a good stay.",4,2019,06,27
23,One of the nest hotles i have stayed in,"The customer service is next level, From recption - Bar staff nothing was to much trouble we stayed in a JR suite the room was lovely we where on the front of the hotel and it was still so quite, roof with a pool/Bar as great veiws of the city and was not to busy during the day and great sun set at night.

I would vist thsi hotel agian and would highly recommend, I vist Barcelona yearly so have stayed a few places.",5,2019,06,27
23,Great for couples!,"Really enjoyed our stay at Ohla Barcelona. All amenities fully met our expectations. Great breakfast, and enjoyed a cocktail  with a great view from roof deck bar as well. Concierge and staff very helpful.

Only caveat is that the hotel shower is open and in the middle of the room, so depending on relationshio of whom you are sharing room with, that could be awkward.",4,2019,06,25
23,Beautiful Hotel excellent customer service,This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in Europe. The staff are extremely customer focused.The room was very clean and well presented. The hotel provides a coffee machine. The hotel is centrally located. Wouls definitely stay here again. Thank you.,5,2019,06,24
23,2nd stay,"Have been here recently for our 2nd stay and no complaints whatsoever. Great location, very clean rooms, friendly staff, very helpful concierge. Nice wine bar and nice rooftop bar.

Hotel is definitely boutiquey so certainly not everyone’s taste (eg open bathroom...).

All in all good value for money, would definitely return.",5,2019,06,23
23,Great Location,"We stayed two nights at Ohla and it was in a fabulous location to explore Barcelona.  Close to shopping, restaurants and transport and we even walked to the Sagrada Familia and other sights.  A bit pricey for the small room we had, however in a premium location.",4,2019,06,22
23,Mother/Daughter Getaway,"Enjoyed our two night stay at Hotel Ohla Barcelona. Great location. Nice, modern and clean. Lovely rooftop bar and pool. Very good tapas restaurant on ground floor. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,06,22
23,Convenient location; great rooftop bar,"Centrally located in the Gothic Quarter close to shops and key attractions; spacious  rooms and a rooftop bar with a spectacular view, pool and deck area.  Food (breakfast and dinner) were great and staff incredibly helpful",5,2019,06,20
23,Oh What a View!,"We only had one day/night in Barcelona and this was the perfect hotel!  We had just completed a transatlantic cruise from Galveston Texas and wanted a central place to explore the city.  The staff was so friendly and accommodating!  The hotel roof bar/pool has the most amazing view and we enjoyed it until our room was ready.  They gave us a free upgrade and breakfast the next morning!  Room was lovely, view from the view was great, bed was very comfortable.  Just loved the glass surround shower!  We will stay here again next year!!",5,2019,06,19
23,Oh it's been great!,"To cut a long story short: it's been great! Spent 3 nights for a city break with my wife and Ohla delivered all the comfort and goodies needed for a careless weekend off. The location is perfect, minutes away from literally anything; and the Gothic quarter is just beautiful to explore. The staff is always there, friendly and professional. 

Stayed in a junior suite on the 6th floor which was very quite and comfortable and had great views outside. Nespresso machine, stocked mini-bar, bath, shower, open bathroom, welcome bottle of Cava on ice ... nothing more to ask for really. We don't usually eat breakfast, so can't comment on that, but we dined two times and the tapas restaurant which was very good and has some fantastic wines on offer if you fancy that.

And the rooftop, yes. It's great for a morning swim or afternoon drinks - a very relaxing place. 

All in all, a fantastic hotel. Absolutely recommended!",5,2019,06,19
23,Great Staff and Location,"Stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon trip and wasn’t disappointed, great location and staff were very helpful especially the guys on Concierge, only used the Rooftop bar once , a magician called Zelig was doing mind blowing card tricks At the bar which I enjoyed  . Nice touch to have a bottle of cava in ice awaiting us in our room upon us returning to our room after a days sightseeing on our last night . Stayed on the 7th floor and Would defo stay again if I visit Barcelona",5,2019,06,10
23,The perfect ending to our honeymoon!,"We ended our honeymoon in Barcelona at The Ohla Barcelona hotel and it was truly the cherry on top of the most wonderful trip of a lifetime. The hotel is gorgeous and modern and feels like one big art display, while the outside of the hotel has old beautiful gothic architecture. The rooms are immaculate and interesting and so mod. We were treated like royalty and were so impressed at how knowledgeable and friendly the staff was. Shoutout to the concierge for being SO kind and helpful! 

The rooftop pool and space is incredible with breathtaking views and delicious sangria! I could stay up there all day. We fell in love with Barcelona and plan on going back as soon as possible. We loved the hotel so much that we will never stay anywhere else. Our experience was 10/10. This hotel has it all (amazing service, amenities, free breakfast, internet, and the perfect location in the gothic quarter). They even brought us a bottle of cava for our honeymoon celebration. Ohla Barcelona went above and beyond to make our experience unforgettable.",5,2019,06,10
23,Perfection achieved. Best rooftop in Barcelona!,Everything about our stay was a fantasy. The concierge was incredibly helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect. The rooftop bar was the best. I never want to stay anywhere else if ever in Barcelona again .,5,2019,06,10
23,"Superb surroundings for having a relaxing, indulgent break!","The quality of service provided by the team of staff was of the highest standard. Any need was anticipated and met efficiently, without service being overbearing. 
There was the very widest of catering for breakfasts. The tapas restaurant was excellent. The tasting menu restaurant is extravagant, but good value for the excellent food and enjoyable experience.Worth every euro!",4,2019,06,07
23,What a dream,"We are just completing s 3 night stay her and it is eithout doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in.

The deluxe room is wonderful with glass shower in middle of room. The room is large and tastefully decorated with nice coffee machine. The welcome was fabulous and the allowed us to check in 3 hours early , and offered us water and chocolate covered strawberries whilst waiting. They then delivered cava and ice bucket to our room
The room is serviced twice daily with chocolate on pillow.
The breakfast is excellent with so many choices. The staff are very attentive.
The roof top pool and bar are stunning and there is no pressure to order more drinks.
The only slight blip is the tapas restaurant is a little tricky with few choices for vegetarians.
Can’t comment on the other restaurant as we didn’t go but it has Michelin star
Well done hotel Ohla",5,2019,06,05
23,Kathy Slatter,"Very good hotel within easy reach of Las Ramblas. The hotel is very clean and well furnished. The bedrooms are excellent in Boutique style. Very comfortable beds 
Impressive swimming pool in roof garden
Good breakfast choices 
Staff helpful and attentive but not intrusive",4,2019,06,05
23,Wonderful three night stay,"The staff were amazingly attentive and friendly
It was our wedding anniversary and the staff bought my wife a cooking book on Paella’s 
This is something they thought about and went and bought especially 
What an amazing and kind thing to do
The bar downstairs and the roof top have their own vibe both of which are great
Breakfast was great and again the staff could not be more helpful and friendly",5,2019,06,04
23,Great Property in the Perfect Location,"Hotel Ohla Barcelona is a perfect location to, not only visit many of the city's sites, but is a wonderful retreat, when we need a quiet spot to relax, refresh and recharge. We have recommended Ohla to friend and family, and look forward to staying there on our next visit.",5,2019,05,31
23,Great stay at Ohla Barcelona,"Really enjoyed our 3 night stay here. We were welcomed by the concierge who showed us to the reception to check-in on level 0.5. Very relaxed check-in which included complimentary Cava and chocolate strawberries. The concierge staff were super friendly, helpful and professional. The room was beautiful, really comfortable bed and pillows. Chocolates on our bed each evening, and daily housekeeping. We had to leave at 4am for an early flight, and the concierge arranged a taxi for us, as well as a packed breakfast basket to go! We found the staff here really go out of their way for you. Definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2019,05,31
23,Perfection!,"Loved the stay at Ohla Hotel, Barcelona. As the title says, everything was perfect. The staff were wonderful, efficient and welcoming. The room beautiful... we really couldn’t ask for more. We recommend it to anyone.",5,2019,05,30
23,Bathroom sucks.,"Ohla Barcelona has a lot of things going for it. It is located very close to the Cathedral which has a lot of shops and restaurants nearby. The area has a great nightlife with people walking the streets till midnight. It's also very close to Catalunya Square where you can catch the city tour buses. I would have given it 5 stars except for the bathrooms.
In Ohla they have gone for a modern look. The shower has no privacy (the loo has). 
If you don't mind seeing your room mate naked while they shower then it doesn't matter. But if that's a problem then I suggest you seek some other hotel.",4,2019,05,27
23,Amazing!,"We had a wonderful stay at this boutique hotel. We were there in May 2019 for 3 days following a 17 ocean crossing. The hotel is upscale modern, very tastefully decorated. Loved the rooftop bar, too. There is a Michelin star restaurant which we thoroughly enjoyed. 

The concierge staff goes the extra mile to be helpful. That's important to me. We experienced difficulties contacting the transportation vendor to determine pick up time for departure to the airport. The morning concierge said he would take care of it and told me to go out and enjoy Barcelona. When we returned to the hotel later in the day we had a pick up time. We really appreciated his effort. He also shared his knowledge about the city and recommended some excellent restaurants.

The flowers, candy and cava when we arrived were pretty special as well.",5,2019,05,27
23,Nice hotel not sure if it is 5 star,"My husband and i stayed at the Ohla Barcelona hotel in May 2019 with our 7 month old baby. When we arrived we were greeted by the concierge and directed to the 1st floor to check in. We took the lift and as the doors opened the reception reminded us of a spa rather than a hotel as it was very dimly lit and consisted of a desk with 2 chairs facing it. - we found this quite strange. The girls on reception were polite and courteous, however very young and in our opinion maybe a little inexperienced for this customer facing role. We were provided with cool hand towels to freshen up and ushered to our room. We had booked an upgraded junior suite to ensure we had a bath for our young son to enjoy. We were in room 611. We had also requested a cot to be made available for our stay and completed the necessary forms to request hypoallergenic pillows with the scent of lavender. When we got to our room we were slightly disappointed as the pillows we requested were not there. We were however gifted a bottle of Cava and some chocolates (unfortunately we are not alcohol drinkers so the gesture was a bit wasted on us). Overall the room did not compare well to other junior suites we have enjoyed in other European cities. The room was smaller than we would expect, the bathroom was impractical with a hidden WC with a very heavy door that had no lock and could not be propped open. The shower sprayed water all over the floor and the bath mat could not stay outside the door as the door would not open with it there. The plugs in the double sinks did not keep water in the sinks. The mini bar was in a cupboard and was not well ventilated so potentially a fire hazard. Speaking of fire - the windows in the room do not open and at the time the staff member who showed us to our room were not aware of the fire escape plans. The tv makes an awfully loud sound when you turn it on and off - not ideal with a sleeping baby in tow. We had booked bed and breakfast and the staff in the restaurant were very friendly. The food at breakfast was hit and miss, with the same items each day and some days these were fresher than others. We felt it would be better to have a variety each day rather than repetition as this can become tiresome after 2 or 3 days. There were very few options for our weaning baby e.g. no unsalted butter, no porridge, no weetabix however, we would especially like to recognise Ana who really went out of her way to accommodate us and our child even ordering us weetabix to feed our son breakfast on our last few days and providing us with a high chair each day that was very helpful.The concierge were always friendly and helpful. The gym is tiny with limited equipment. The wellness centre consists of a sauna, hairdressers sink and chair, massage facilities and 2 WCs. The rooftop pool is more of a plunge pool and in our opinion used for show to attract people to the bar rather than for practical use. We unfortunately could not use it with our son as it was not heated - this was very disappointing for a so called 5 star hotel. The hotel restaurant La Plassohla serves amazing food. We had the suckling pig and slow cooked beef with truffle tagliatelle, patatas bravas and ham croquettes - the food was delicious and definitely worth a try. The hotel itself is in a good location close to most areas of interest to tourists. We felt on the outside this hotel looks fairly decent, however the finer details expected in a 5 star hotel were missing for us. ",4,2019,05,19
23,Great central location ,"Very nice hotel with extremely helpful and informative concierge. Rooms nice size for European standards. Location the best next to the Old Town and not far from
Beach. Also steps away from major bus lines and metro stops along w Aerobus to the airport",4,2019,05,11
23,Fabulous hotel and Michelin star restaurant,"Stayed here for 4 nights, had an amazing time, staff couldn’t be more helpful and hotel room spotless 
Cava when we arrived and checked in also at breakfast if you want it. Buffet breakfast has a great selection of the quality you would expect from a hotel of this standard...... loved it and would happily stay there again.... thank you hotel Ohla 😊",5,2019,05,07
23,Good but definitely room for improvement,"I enjoyed my stay with my fiancee but there were a few things that the hotel could really improve on.  
Firstly check in:  Check in was confusing, you don't check in on the ground floor.  There's a concierge desk which I mistook for check in.  We stood awkwardly for 10 minutes before a member of staff told us to check in on the floor above.  
The check in area was cramped.  We had to wait around 15 minutes before we were able to get a member of staff to check us in.

We stayed in a junior suite with a city view which was fantastic!  I would highly recommend!  Bvlgari amenities, comfortable bed, nepresso machine, large bath tub and a well stocked mini bar.
The hotel is environmentally friendly which is great.  Glass bottles of water provided etc and they don't throw out the likes of shampoo and conditioner bottles after one use which I've seen other hotels doing.
Wifi was also excellent and tv had plenty of channels.
On the first evening we received a complimentary bottle of Cava which was a nice touch.  

Negatives with room: pillows were poor (very flat) and there was a constant smell in the toilet.

Rooftop bar / pool area:  Disappointing to say the least.  Incredible views over the city and one of the reasons we booked this hotel however:
No loungers to sunbathe
The pool was very small 
Stupidly overpriced!  16 euro for a cocktail, 10 euro for a pint of beer, 35 euro for a measure of premium rum. (Ron Zacappa XO which retails around £80 per bottle).  
One member of staff on the bar to serve 40+ guests in the afternoon.  We ended up getting up and leaving after waiting 30 minutes.
We only got to enjoy the area in the evening.

Breakfast: Breakfast was good and there was plenty of choice.

Overall I was impressed with my stay and the hotel has a great location for exploring Barcelona.",4,2019,05,06
23,Returned my phone-charger by posting it to UK .,"This Hotel has incredibly nice staff. 
We were received with a bottle of champagne, the front desk for tourist guidance has been extremely helpful. The room service has never been so quick in my holidays as in this hotel. 
On top of it they returned by posting to UK , our phone-charger that we had forgotten in the room.",5,2019,05,02
23,Beware of your money and credit cards,"**Updated Review**

I stayed here for 5 days for a job. During my stay I enjoyed the location and the concierge desk was helpful with recommendations. 

My problem was with the cleaning staff who had ""sticky fingers"" while tending my room for 2 days. When I told the front desk woman (4/17 at 7:30a) she dismissed me and said that they are only humans and cannot control them from temptation. Also that a mere $120 was not enough to fire someone nor worth calling the police. These were just some of the excuses she gave me. While I do realize that partially it is my fault for not putting the money in the safe, I also thought my belongings were secure because this is a 5 star hotel. I did not think that they would rummage through my things.

I left with a bad taste and checked out. The next morning (back in US), I got hit with 3 unauthorized charges on my credit card. It took 5 days to get a response from the front end manager, Jorge Biedma. Apparantly my cc was used to guarantee 2 other rooms for their incidentals. I NEVER approved of this. I don't even know these people! Shouldn't it be protocol to ask the actual cardholder? This is a security issue! So make sure you check your money, invoices and cc statements. 

It's such a shame because the hotel is nice and their other location in Eixample is lovely but they need to really work on their customer service, management and security issues.",1,2019,04,29
23,Beautiful hotel! ,"You will not be disappointed. The rooms, location and service is absolutely excellent!  You are greeted right away and handed a wonderful glass of cava. The concierge is so helpful. The location right in the gothic district is perfect for walking around to see the beautiful architecture. Hands down excellent place to stay in Barcelona. ",5,2019,04,28
23,Flawless,"Sincerely, a wonderful experience. 

We stayed four nights and found ourselves in the rarest situation: despite the incredible time spent discovering almost every inch of Barcelona — every basilica, path, coffee, synagogue and bar, particularly around the Gothic Quarter itself — the hotel room remains as much a fond memory as anything else in the city. The concierge staff, Rafa and co., were warm and an overall asset to hospitality. Their attitude towards booking our preferred restaurants, organising our travel etc. was probably the starkest reminder that we were in a five-star joint. The breakfast was diverse and well-made, and the decor was supremely tasteful. The room, crucially, was great. Perhaps a central glass shower on a raised platform would be a touch avant garde for older couples - not to be presumptuous - but with daily unintrusive housekeeping, a yawning expense of a bed and linen apparently stitched from spring clouds, anybody ought to be happy.

The roof bar: we’ve all seen the pictures by now, and they are probably a significant factor in your choice to book. It speaks for itself. Great views, a pool that we didn’t use but others enjoyed, and lifetime sunsets. The drinks prices are a bit above the average cocktail bar mark, but all things considered I’d say you get what you pay for.

An establishment and team absolutely worthy of every star. We will be back.",5,2019,04,27
23,Wonderful stay,"The hotel itself is beautiful, all the facilities are excellent and the location is brilliantly central. The staff could not have been more helpful and as Sant Jordi day was during our stay, they even gave us a traditional gift of a rose and a book which was such a lovely surprise and way to introduce us further into Catalan culture. 
Can’t recommend this hotel enough!
Thank you to Hotel Ohla and all the brilliant staff.",5,2019,04,27
23,An Excellent Hotel,20th Anniversary stay for 3 nights and we loved everything about this hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful and gave great advice.

23,Great hotel,"Really nice boutique hotel.  Location was great.  Rooftop bar was quaint.  Would just say that the rooftop bar was quite a bit more expensive than the regular bar in the hotel.   
Staff were fantastic.   Rooms were great.  Junior Suite.   
Definitely recommend and would go back",5,2019,04,20
23,Wonderful hotel with beautiful room!,"If you’re in Barcelona I highly recommend Hotel Ohla Barcelona.  Located right in Gothic Quarter near the old Cathedral.  The hotel’s interior is fancy-homey and the exterior is fancy-unique! The staff were all kind and helpful.  The hotel even has a one  Michelin star restaurant in it. We had the seasonal course, and it was a delicious experience.",5,2019,04,19

23,Great hotel ,"Very nice hotel in the Gothic quarter. The staff were very nice and accommodating. The food and breakfast is very good and the bed was comfortable. I wasn’t so keen on the open shower but that’s a personal preference. I would thoroughly recommend I stay at this hotel.

23,Incredible Staff!!!  Incredible hotel!!,"My wife and I recently stayed at Hotel Ohla Barcelona and what could have turned into an incredible disaster on our vacation was turned in to a story we tell friends and family.  While waiting to visit the Sagrada Familia Cathedral before going to our hotel, my bag with my credit cards and passport were stolen.  Not knowing what else to do, we went to our hotel to collect ourselves.  When we told the young man, Pablo, at the Concierge desk, he immediately contacted the on-duty manager, Quique.  Quique was so compassionate and reassuring.  He contacted the police, explaining to them on the phone about what had happened.  He then filed our police report online, printed it and translated it for me to sign.  He arranged for the police to come to the hotel to pick up the report for us.  We felt very safe and cared for by people who we had just met.  Because of the manager's quick action, the following morning the police contacted me and told me my passport had been turned in and I could come get it.  Pablo, at the concierge's desk, got me a taxi, told the driver where to take me and asked him to wait for me (the driver went in to the police station with me). Even staff who had not directly dealt with out situation seemed to know what had happened and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and comforted.  Because of their care for the people who stay in their hotel, the staff made ALL the difference in how our vacation turned out.  Please thank them for us!!  And if I could be contacted directly, I would like to find a way to thank them personally.

The hotel itself was wonderful.  It is located very near to everything we wanted to see and made it very easy to get around by walking.  Our room was beautiful and well appointed.  My wife, particularly, loved the unique design of the shower and the hidden bathroom.  We felt very comfortable and safe in the hotel.  The breakfast was very good.  The valet parking was wonderful.

I can't say enough good things about this hotel.

We will definitely stay at Hotel Ohla Barcelona on our next visit!",5,2019,04,12
23,Great Staff,"Unfortunately we had to cut short our recent stay in Barcelona through unfortunate circumstances, the Hotel management and staff could not have been anymore helpful or supportive, our room was spacious and ideal and the situation of the Hotel is ideal for a short city break. We will visit the city again and we will definitely use Ohla Barcelona for our stay.",5,2019,04,08
23,Amazing Sexy rooms,I just stayed there for my anniversary and it was excellent from check in to check out service. complimentary breakfast even when you check out at 4 am to catch a flight. The concierge scheduled us a taxi and packed a breakfast fro our flight. Amazing we felt super special! They have a wonderful view of Barcelona church and skyline. Plus you walk right into the gothic walkways of artist and local shopping. Metro is a few blocks and easy to walk to the ocean and parks. Bravo Ohla for helping us celebrate 11 years. We highly recommend staying here!,5,2019,04,07
23,Everything you need and relaxing ,"-Check in was smooth

-the room was great, spacious and light

-rooftop terrace is nice in the sunshine

-the hotel has everything you need and the staff are happy to help

-a guest before us had opened olives from the snack tray in our room and we were charged. I spoke to the concierge who was happy to help and get the charge removed

-We had ants in the bathroom and upon check out told staff about this. They were very apologetic and took all our final charges off such as tax and the drinks we had at the bar. They explained this was due to being next to the garden and the weather. The manager was kind and told us to contact him should we stay in future

>overall a relaxed and worry free stay<

23,Birthday treat weekend break.,"Lovely big room, comfortable bed. The shower was in a cubicle in the room which was a bit disconcerting! Our outlook  was over the over next building but wasn't an issue for us. The roof terrace was beautiful with comfortable seating for relaxing in the sun. There was a pool on the terrace for those inclined to swim. Breakfasts were varied with the usual continental style or cooked bacon eggs sausage etc. Tapas was tasty but expensive. This is a well placed hotel for viewing the sights of this beautiful city. The staff were friendly and very helpful, particularly the concierge.",5,2019,04,01
23,Service with a Smile,"My daughter and I recently stayed for 4 nights at this lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona. The staff is dedicated to providing the best experience with exceptional service.  The concierge secured us dinner reservations, made suggestions on sites to visit as well as giving us useful information about the city.  The staff is friendly, polite and patient.  The roof top bar is a delightful place to take small siesta after a day of touring.",5,2019,03,31
23,Can not wait to be back in two weeks time,"We had a lovely week at Barcelona celebrating my husbands birthday. The hotel is amazing, great breakfast with super comfy beds and lovely bathroom. The décor is super cool. Pool on the roof has comfy chair and cool bar. We can not wait to be back here in 2 weeks time. x",5,2019,03,31
23,Solid lodging choice,"Excellent, friendly service. Exemplary front desk. 
Great location; near many attractions. 
Modern rooms, a little on the small side. 
Very good dining options inside and nearby. 
Fair pricing. 
Highly recommend. ",5,2019,03,31
23,Overpriced for what it is,"It’s seems more for a 4star hotel and not a 5star hotel. The breakfast was nice but the rooms were not at all special for their prices. The staff was professional and always helpful. Next time I will definitely try something else, since their rooms didn’t have something special. You can find similar rooms at different hotels with more reasonable prices. ",4,2019,03,29
23,BEST SERVICE,"Just wanted to say big thank you to  Ohla’s staff,been all around the world in 5 star hotels and i have never experienced flawless service like this before.They will pay attention to every single detail of your trip very friendly and super helpfull.Hotel is very clean-nice location!.Once again thank you for the staff!!",5,2019,03,27
23,Fab Boutique/Design hotel ,"We recently stayed for 2 nights mid week &  were greeted with glasses of cava at reception whist checking in...a lovely touch. We had arrived very early so our room wasn’t ready but reception took our luggage for storage & when we returned later that day, the cases had already been taken to our room. We had a deluxe design room, which together with it’s great location, is one of the reasons we selected this hotel. It’s modern & stylish, with dark contemporary interiors set within an historic old building that was once a department store.  The bathroom was amazing, with the “secret” toilet & it’s design ideas like this that mark it out as a boutique hotel. Breakfasts have a good selection which is self service, but you can have eggs/omelettes cooked to order & see chef preparing it for you. The selection is constantly being replenished so there are never 1/2 full displays of food. Cava is also available at breakfast...another sign of a 5* hotel. We had drinks on the rooftop terrace when there was a Super-Moon & the view was stunning, although a little chilly. However guests were offered blankets to keep warm. As previously reviewed, beer €10 & cava €8 on the roof terrace, but well worth it for the view & location. Fabulously situated for the main sites & to be in the midst of the Gothic Quarter was another reason for choosing the Ohla. Our 2nd visit to Barcelona so we didn’t need to revisit a lot of the touristy sites, we just wanted to immerse ourselves in the Spanish culture..relax & unwind, sit outside in the sun to eat & drink beer & Sangria. We will definitely be back ...& stay at the Ohla. ",5,2019,03,26
23,"Exceptional service, facilities and location!","Greeted with sparkling wine, chocolate coated strawberries and welcoming staff, this was just the start for us at this amazing hotel.

The location here is great - walking distance to all major city highlights and tour starting points. 

The hotel is a five star establishment in every way - the rooms were modern, clean and very comfortable. 

The hotel has the best in dining options with great bars, tapas, elegant dining, from the ground floor up to the awesome rooftop bar. 

The staff at this hotel are exemplary! I hope they are rewarded for their efforts. 

",5,2019,03,24
23,Peter G,"Magical gem of a hotel right in the heart of the best parts of Barcelona. Great service and staff, with great restaurants in house too. Rooms are lovely and an amazing roof top bar and pool, definitely worth a visit",5,2019,03,22
23,Great hotel!,"Spent 5 nights at this hotel & was amazed at the welcoming, attentive & helpful staff who went above & beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. The rooms are well appointed & the rooftop terrace is beautiful!  The breakfast buffet was good & plentiful. We also enjoyed the adjacent Vistro wine bar, again very pleasant & helpful staff. ",5,2019,03,21
23,Nice hotel with a great location ,"Stayed for one night at the end of February. Great location with lots within walking distance. Good size room, first floor but on a side street so not too noisy. The roof top bar and pool is well worth a visit; was too cold to swim but looks like it would be a great venue in warmer weather. Would recommend. ",5,2019,03,17
23,Lovely hotel in a central posit,"We spent 2 nights in a junior suite. The room and the hotel were lovely. Staff were great, breakfast was fine, not stunning. But we really liked the rooftop bar - although I think it would be nicer in Summer, and the pool might be a bit more tempting then too! The concierge was helpful - but if asking for dinner recommendations be sure to be clear if you want a really nice meal or an everyday one. We wanted to push the boat out a bit, but really didn’t! Check things are open too - a recommended bar had closed down. Overall recommended highly.",5,2019,03,16
23,nice amenities,The hotel is well appointed and comfortable.   The view from the rooftop was very pretty and our room offered  several extras to make our stay quite pleasant.  The hotel arranged for pick from the airport and transfer to our cruise ship.  The staff are friendly and helpful.,4,2019,03,15
23,Great location ,"Unusual decor, with corrugated metal finish in corridors. We stayed in a design deluxe room with a dominant exposed shower in the middle of it. We chose this from the British Airways website and did not realise we would have the exposed shower until later when we had booked and then looked on the hotel website. We like the decor at the bed side of the room, with a nice simple modern finish. We did not like the other side as the matt black finish on walls and floor made it very gloomy and hard to see for shaving, make-up and choosing clothes, etc. We would choose a different room if we returned. Staff have all been very helpful, and the standards are very good.  The breakfast buffet has also been good. We have not eaten in either restaurant during the evening. The rooftop bar and pool are very attractive with a great view.",4,2019,03,12
23,"Wonderful service, great location","This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to most sights and opposite the metro for those further afield.  

From the moment we walked in, every member of staff went out of their way to welcome us and help. 

The rooftop bar is a lovely spot for a sunny, relaxed drink. 

The only thing that let our trip down was the room, which as other reviews mentioned, had the shower in the bedroom.  Fine if you don’t want any  privacy but not my preference.   The staff did install some screening at my request.

If it hadn’t been for the room, this would rank as one of the nicest hotels i’ve stayed in for a while.",4,2019,03,11
23,Oasis in the Heart of Barcelona,"I have been to Barcelona many times, mostly staying at the beach, but recently stayed at the Hotel Ohla and really enjoyed it.  Three things stand out - Michelin starred chef provides great food at a variety of choices on the property, roof top bar has incredible views and great ambience, helpful and friendly staff across the board.  Plus you are in the heart of Barcelona and can walk to so many attractions.  

I will be back for sure!",5,2019,03,11
23,Best hotel stay ever!!,"I stayed at the Ohla Barcelona during a work trip that we turned into a mini family vacation. With all the hotels I've stayed at over the years, this was by far the most memorable hotel stay. The hotel was completely sold out due to a nearby conference and yet they still managed to make the stay special and unique. We were greated with cava, chocolate covered strawberries, and warm wash towels. During the stay it was my husbands birthday and I wanted to try and make it special. Eduardo organized for a surprise in our room while we were out to dinner with 30 balloons, cava, and a delicious cake. It was so special!! We brought our baby on the trip and he was even gifted crayons and a coloring book. The hotel stay was absolutely perfect, the room beautiful and elegant, and the location in the gothic quarter is AMAZING. Cant wait to come back!!",5,2019,03,04
23,The perfect hotel for a relaxing weekend break,"The main attraction when booking this hotel was for the rooftop views across Barcelona. Although quite a way from the sea, you could still see the sea, beyond the cathedral and across the city centre. It really didn't disappoint. It was always relaxing and chilled there, only a handful of small groups of people at all hours of the day which gave it that chilled out vibe with nice music in the background. A pint of Estrella lager from the rooftop bar was €10 as opposed to €6 downstairs at the hotel bar. A glass of cava is €8 but if you're only going there a couple of times for a weekend break just to see the sunset, or a quick drink before a night out then it's worth the money considering the views. Friendly staff too.
We were upgraded to a junior suite having paid for a deluxe room and it was absolutely amazing! A fantastic shower, a hidden door for the toilet, spacious living area and a king size comfy bed! We both loved it. We were facing the pedestrian side street from the main road and although quite a distance from the road, we could still hear traffic and people into the early hours of the night but to be honest it didn't effect our night sleep at all and we never had an issue with lost hours sleep due to this.
The restaurant is lovely. This is where we had breakfast every morning. The food was nice, lots of choice from cereal to boiled eggs, a selection of breads, fruit, bacon, pastries etc etc I could go on. It was all there. And for once, a hotel with normal sized tumbler glasses! No more having to fill up two glasses like other hotels. But saying that, small plates! I'm being very picky here aren't I! If you want scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, tomato and toast... Probably best to use two plates! 
But anyway, that is a small concern considering the bigger picture. The staff were incredibly helpful. The cleaning staff were especially good and made sure our room was spotless every day. 
It really was a fantastic stay worth giving this hotel 5 out of 5 stars!",5,2019,03,04
23,The stinky bathroom ,The hotel is nice. The big problem is that the room window can't be opened and the wc booth has no vent. The water pressure in the shower is inadequate. ... Definitely not a 5 stars hotel..  A pity as the location is really perfect and strategic to visit the city ,3,2019,03,04
23,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OHLA HOTEL REFUSED TO HONOR CONFIRMED RESERVATION, KICKED US OUT, OBVIOUSLY SOLD ROOM FOR MORE MONEY","Absolutely horrible and embarrassing experience and with this 5 STARS hotel.

 I have booked the room on Priceline.com for the total of $270 for one night. The reservation was for February 24th 2019. We had a Priceline.com confirmation with booking number and Ohla hotel confirmation number. The room was fully paid for with credit card.  

When we arrived at Ohla hotel at about 1:30 pm to check in, the person at the front desk said that hotel has no reservation for us. The front desk manager Jorge Biedma came and he actually was very nice and sweet, but also said that hotel has no reservation for us and hotel sold out completely - so no rooms available and he can't help us. I was about to believe that it's a technical mistake or computer error, but when Mr. Biedma said that he never heard about PRICELINE.COM I realized that he is lying! Can any one believed that a hotel manager at 5 stars hotel in Barcelona doesn't know about PRICELINE.COM !!!???  They obviously sold our reserved room for higher price - it was the time of 2019 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and the prices for the hotels went sky high! He said that we need to find another hotel and leave the property. But all hotels in the center of Barcelona were sold out or we had to to pay around $1500-2000 per night! I went on line from my own computer end up find some other (not very nice) hotel far away from the city center - but I had no choice. Our day was ruined! Our planes were ruined! And I have never been so embarrassed in my life! Is that how 5 stars Ohla hotel in Barcelona treated guests?! It's a shame! 

 I hope this review would help other people to make smart decision and avoid this hotel at any cost!",1,2019,02,28
23,Wonderful Hospitality!,"My husband and I travelled to Barcelona in June 2018. I am so glad that we stayed at this beautiful Hotel.  It is in an amazing position, being in the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona.  It is easy walking distance to so many of the places to visit.  The rooms are modern, clean and bright.  The breakfast in the Hotel was very good with a great selection.  There is a beautiful bar and swimming pool on the top of the building with wonderful views.  On our first night out my husband damaged his back on the walk back to the Hotel and proceeded to spend the next 10 days flat on his back in bed whilst we worked out how we were going to get him home.  We had only booked for three  nights and ended up staying for nine nights.  The Hotel management and staff were amazing, from upgrading us to a larger room/suite to keeping the icepacks cold and retrieving them for me at all hours of the night, to doing whatever they could to make a difficult situation easier for us.  I cannot say enough good things about the Hotel and the people.  ",5,2019,02,27
23,Absolutely love this hotel!,"Jorge was incredible and was super helpful throughout my trip! I absolutely loved my stay- from my beautiful room, the gorgeous rooftop and great room service, I couldn’t be happier. Great location and walking distance from all of my favorite restaurants and shops!! Highly recommend!!!",5,2019,02,25
23,Amazing ,"This was one superb hotel. 
I Will most definitely stay again. 
Superb team, excellent service and meet any requirement you have. 
Superb breakfast. 
Extremely comfortable beds and so many pillows to choose from!
Very very clean hotel and rooms. 
Roof top bar and pool has amazing views and good place to watch the sun set. 
Superb location. ",5,2019,02,19
23,"A great hotel, in the best location.","The stand-out impression of this hotel is the people. They all give the impression that they love their jobs, rather than just having been trained in 'hospitality'. Apart from that, the hotel is located within walking distance of most 'sites', is easily accessible, and has all the facilities one might wish for. Our room was spacious, quiet, with a bath and shower, and a huge, very comfortable bed. There are at least 3 options for eating and drinking on the premises, not to mention the rooftop pool and bar, and the sauna. But the real good news is the people, who are attentive, friendly and efficient, without being obsequious; they treated us as guests, or family, not 'clients'.",5,2019,02,18
23,"Amazing location and staff, be careful on room selection","Stayed at Ohla one night. Great location. The staff here is amazing bar none. They were all so friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. 10 stars for them. We stayed in a double room. It’s modern but small. Others have mentioned the exposed shower and I definitely think it’s something to take into account. Not only can your hotel mates see you taking a shower but there’s also no privacy/ability to be quiet when changing, drying hair, etc. If I stayed here again I’d specifically request a room with a different layout.",5,2019,02,10
23,Amazing Stay at this Hotel!,"The service at this hotel is 5 stars all the way! From the moment you sent your foot in the door, you know thet you are in some place special! First we arrived at the lobby and were told that we would be upgrated to a junior suite! This made our day as it was our last few days in Spain and it is our 25th wedding anniversary!  We were greated with a nice glass of cava. The service and brrakfast has been absolutely outstanding! The room was outstanding and the service perfect. One cannot ask for anything more! Highly recommended to anyone! ",5,2019,02,07
23,Weekend away,"This hotel deserves its 5 Stars, without doubt a lovely find in the heart of Barcelona. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne upon check in. We mentioned it was our anniversary & later we returned to our from tonfind a complimentary bottle on ice.. seriously lovey touch, cannot wait to go back.",5,2019,02,02
23,Amazing hotel,"Roof top bar and pool is amazing. Perfect location, close to all attractions and metro. Staff were all accommodating and friendly. Rooms lovely and spacious. Would stay again tomorrow! Highly recommend. ",5,2019,02,01
23,Simply Perfect,"This is the experience you should be looking for. Every staff member we dealt with had the refined grace of confidence and knowledge in their role without arrogance, which in turn lends itself to a true five-star stay. Easy flowing conversations lacking the stuffiness of other hotels seeking the accolades. The in-house facilities, bars, and restaurants almost make you not want to leave and see the city but they do offer excellent alternatives to return to following your sight-seeing. The room was well equipped and nicely furnished. The team were, from concierge to reception, customer experience to breakfast:  polite, friendly, and helpful. We will return to Barcelona and we will only seek out to stay here again.
My particular thanks to Quinque for communicating with me so well prior to arrival and arranging everything for my wife's birthday despite us arriving well before check-in.",5,2019,01,22
23,"Very comfortable and superb stay and location of hotel, one more reason we loved it","Ok, this is not your normal family budget hotel, its on a higher side but stay there and you may be able to justify the rate. We were upgraded to a DESIGN DELUXE but then we eventually chose JUNIOR SUITE as that suited the room size we wanted for 6 night stay.

Food : We were on Breakfast included rates. We are pure vegetarians and we were little disappointed at that part. They did not have any vegetarian option in food. But we eat eggs so it did not effect but vegetarian options were missed. More when we saw the other hotel where our friends stayed had an option of boiled sautéed vegetables with mushrooms and pizza slices as options for vegetarians included in breakfast. So yes they need to work on this big time by asking the guests when they check in, they have hospitality services who mail you before hand asking for bed type pillow type, but i think food should be included in that.

STAY : one word, AWESOME, no complaints. If i forget breakfast experience, we were absolutely delighted to stay in this hotel. Very comfortable and very good for a couple. Well if its a family or grown up children, this is not the hotel to stay. Its purely couple based.

LOCATION : Had to write this separately, cause it requires attention. If you are a shopaholic or window shoppers, the location cannot be better than this hotel. All major brands surround you in walking distance including the street just besides you has good shopping options. Food options, more than what you can ask for. In short everything even some major sight seeing locations are also closer. Taxis always present when you need them, just tell their efficient concierges and they are ready to help you anytime. Calling taxi is just one but also helping you with your luggage , parking your rental (there is a charge for parking), or any tasks assigned to them is understood and perfectly executed.

As all hotels in Barcelona have, they have a good roof top. But we didnt use it o no comments.

ALL IN ALL perfect experience and would defintely stay again. Management please do something about your breakfast options, for the price it should defintely be more.",5,2019,01,21
23,Husbands 60th Birthday,Stayed at this lovely hotel 10th-13th January to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday. It is a lovely hotel in an excellent location. We had a design deluxe room on the 6th floor and it was spotless. All the hotel staff were efficient and friendly. Special mention to Jose the concierge who was extremely helpful with advice and information. The buffet breakfast had lots of choice and the omelettes were delicious. Nice little touches such as a bottle of Cava on ice in our room when we arrived . Chocolate on our bed every night. Always plenty of toiletries. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.,5,2019,01,20
23,An amazing hotel ,"Wow we loved this hotel. We stayed for two nights in January and the hotel really is exceptional. The check in was great with a glass of cava to start our weekend off. We were upgraded to a fabulous junior suite and the room was amazing. We ate in the tapas restaurant and the food was excellent. Big well done to Jose who was the best concierge we have ever met. He greeted us by our names each time he saw us and dealt with any questions really professionally. 
The amazing roof terrace and its views make this the most wonderful place to stay in Barcelona. We are definitely coming back. ",5,2019,01,13
23,Relaxed Boutique Hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"This is a great hotel on the edge of the gothic quarter in easy walking distance of Barceloneta. Nice rooftop pool and bar, and a small but functional gym. Shame the bedroom windows don't open, but understandable why they don't. Concierge were very helpful.",4,2019,01,09
23,Will definitely be back!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. The location is great (Born / Gothic area). The concierge is wonderful and helped me make dinner reservations and museum reservations. The breakfast exceeded expectations and the dining room staff are friendly and helpful. The room was spotless and beautifully designed. I ordered room service one night and was very happy. One of the best features the hotel offers each guest is a Handy phone, a phone I could use around the city for calls, GPS and internet, free of charge. Excellent feature!!",4,2019,01,08
23,Visit with my mom,"정말 만족했던 호텔이에요.
우선 위치가 정말 좋아서 어디든 걸어가기 쉽고, 호텔 디자인도 예쁘고, 무엇보다 모든 스태프가 정말 친절했습니다. 다음에 바르셀로나 간다면 꼭 다시 방문하고 싶어요!

I was very satisfied with this hotel. 
Great location, nice interior and above all kind staffs. If there is another opportunity to visit Barcelona, I definitely revisit this hotel. 

Era muy contenta con esto hotel. Gracias por todos empleados amables!",5,2019,01,03
23,Great boutique hotel in every way,"Everything was fantastic about our stay there.  Five star through and through.

The staff - they were so friendly and helpful.  They really made you feel special.  On check in, even the manager himself helped us with our bags.  The concierge spent as much time as needed to help with city landmarks and making restaurant recommendations and reservations.  We received complimentary sparkling wine and strawberries on multiple occasions.

The room - bigger than we expected.  Clean, modern and nice with enough space for everything.  We had a quiet room on a high floor near the back of the hotel.

The top floor outdoor patio, bar and pool - perfect for unwinding after a long day of touring.  

Location - is central which allowed easy access to all the sites, shops and restaurants.  Never had to take a taxi or bus anywhere, except to go to Parc Guell.  We walked everywhere else.

Food - the breakfast every morning in the adjacent restaurant was fantastic and gourmet.  A great way to start your day.  At night we dined their once and the food and tapas was excellent.

This hotel is a sure thing, in my opinion.",5,2019,01,01
23,"Perfect location, beautiful room, great staff","My wife and I greatly enjoyed our stay at the Ohla Barcelona - the staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful, the location is perfect, the room very comfortable with excellent amenities.

23,I really recommend here,"웰컴 드링크부터 세심한 배려가 느껴지는 호텔입니다. 위치도 너무 좋구요, 조식도 너무 좋습니다. 호텔 일층에 있는 타파스레스토랑, 와인바, 미슐랭 프렌치 레스토랑까지 있어요 너무 완벽해요The best hotel in Barcelona. All staffs are so friendly, the location is really good and the desing of the room is so modern and artistic  You can walk to most spots. I really recommend here for whom looking for great atmosphere and location.",5,2018,12,25
23,Fantastic in Every Way,"Don't even bother looking at any other hotels this one has it all ! Fantastic location , friendly , helpful & efficient staff.
Breakfast perfect. Lovely rooms, Large Towels . Really enjoyed our stay here , only minutes walk from the attractions in Barcelona.",5,2018,12,16
23,Exceptional staff,From the moment we set foot in this exquisite hotel we were treated like royalty. The reception was outstanding. Cava whilst checking in??? Where would you get it. The concierge were flawless. A special shout out to the lovely smiley guy who got us our taxi this morning. Can t remember his name. Sorry. Went above and beyond. Location is excellent for sightseeing. It was my hubby s birthday and a complimentary bottle of Cava was left in our room Well done. Very impresssed,5,2018,12,16
23,boutique hotel in a good location,"On arrival it felt special, reception was very friendly and helpful. Our room was a unique design and great for the one night we were staying. It was on two levels and again had a quite unique shower. Everything was top quality, and bed very comfortable. Had lunch in their tapas style restaurant, very good. The breakfast buffet was, however, very average. Would choose to stay again.",5,2018,11,30
23,A great first experience,"First of all, an incredible welcome outside by a concierge, while we were looking for the parking of the hotel.The concierge service is really efficient and pro-active for all kind of requests.

Moreover, we have had the chance to do the check-in with the Front Office Manager Mr. Jorge who has been very helpful, empathetic and friendly until the last minute of our stay.

Do not forget to have a diner in the One Star Michelin Restaurant of the hotel,(CAELIS - Chef Romain Fornell)  you won't forget it at all. Once again a warm welcome and a great service. The food is just amazing and truly original using the last technics as fusion for some meals. Do not forget to book as it is one of the most famous place in the city.

The suite (Junior Suite de Luxe) we have had was very confortable, well equiped and not noisy at all even if it was situated one of the main boulevard of Barcelona. And the hotel is ideally situated for all kind of excursion and shopping (Passeig de Grassia). 

Also, take the time to enjoy a drink at the main bar (Vistro 49 Wine Bar - Special thank to the french Sommelier in charge of the bar who gave us good advices) and the other one on the roof of the hotel for a late drink in a warm cove and cool/friendly service.

We shall probably be back as we have really appreciated the people, the service and the atmosphere. 

We recommend you this hotel for a short or long stay.

Thanks for all.",5,2018,11,30
23,Wonderful!,"I’ve stayed in some better hotels but this place is lovely! Eye balls covering the outside and a rooftop pool make this such a unique hotel. The rooms are well catered, flat screen tv, mini bar, fully stocked with brand names too, feature shower and everything you need this was a lovely stay. The breakfast was lovely too, everything you would want cooked or continental. A glass of champagne and strawberries on arrival made this a cool stay and worthy of 5 stars! Close to the sights and a 5 minute walk to the marina. I would stay again! ",5,2018,11,30
23,Good choice,"The hotel is very central and it’s walking distance to most of the touristic attractions.
The room is spacious, clean and staff look after you with a great selection of amenities. We got a Cava wine as a welcome. Breakfast is good and there is a very good selection of savoury and sweet food. The same is for drinks. The terrace has an amazing view and it’s perfect for a cocktail. I highly recommend this place.",5,2018,11,25
23,WHERE FORM LOVES FUNCTION,"If you are fortunate enough to visit Barcelona, (whose many attractions and virtues are too numerous to extol here) do yourselves the favour of booking into the OHLA BARCELONA HOTEL on Via Laietana, 49, 08003 Barcelona, Spain, in the gothic quarter of this fantastic city.

You step into a strategically lit and very stylish hall which evokes an art gallery more than the usual hotel foyers. Concierges are polished and good at their job in mos quality hotels; the heartfelt and enthusiastic passion here immediately alert you that this is a place unlike others.

This trademark approach is continued when you take the lift up half a floor to reception to be warmly and professionally greeted by staff who goes the extra mile. This is your first taste of an approach to hospitality which is very definitely a cut above the very high standard which is expected - and usually found - in establishments of this category.

When you are ushered to your room, you are in for a treat. Again, ‘ushered’ is an inadequate term. This is usually perfectly fine in many places. Sometimes perfunctory, truth be told. Here, the approach is of a proud home owner showing  cherished guests to their quarters. This was our second stay at the OHLA and this eye-widening moment applied both times. Again, this is a building dripping with architectural style and detail; unlike some ultra stylish places, however, this is ALSO a building where your every comfort is incorporated into the uber design. You will not be scrabbling around for a comfortable place to sit ….. or adequate storage for your bits and bobs, all in the name of design (as has happened to us in other places in other cities) These rooms are indeed magnificent; everything you could possibly need is there; an abundance of fluffy towels and quality amenities. Really comfortable and functional showers where the doors seal perfectly and the hot water is instantaneous. Both of these sound obvious, but again are not always the case, even in multi starred establishments. Well, here it is all perfect.

And how will you sleep? Well, having chosen the sheets and pillows you prefer prior to arrival, these are quite possibly the most comfortable beds ever! Both times we visited, the place was blissfully quiet so a wonderful night's sleep is guaranteed. By the way, your room is going to be looked after   exceptionally. Again: Perfection.

Do tear yourselves away from the paradisial bed however, because breakfast is something else again. Step down to the restaurant from the foyer, again in a very stylish space. Ana attends to you with the trademark OHLA professional warmth. The buffet is varied and generous. Anyone who is not fully delighted with breakfast here, frankly, must be one of those people it is impossible to please!

This OHLA (there is another further uptown) is ideally situated in the gothic quarter, within easy distance of excellent gastronomic haunts, fabulous shopping and attractions. To mention but a few, you are minutes’ walk away (see map) from the 800year old Cathedral (450m); Gaudi’s Casa Batillo (1km); Las Ramblas (500m); the Picasso Museum (750m) in the El Born area; elegant shopping in Passeig de Gràcia (500m) and cosy treasure troves for delicious gastronomic delights. It’s all easy walking. The stunning Sagrada Familia is only a 10 minute cab ride away. Or a gorgeous walk, if you feel like discovering unexpectedly amazing architecture along the wide tree lined boulevards.

The fact that we returned for a second taste of the OHLA speaks for itself. Indeed, we would not dream of returning to Barcelona and staying anywhere else. But don't take our word for it: Go and find out for yourselves!",5,2018,11,24
23,Awesome!!,"Staff... and service perfecto!!
Room... absolutely amazing.
Bath... best view from a bathtub I’ve ever had.
Breakfast... the eggs in the little ramekins are so tasty. Planning on making them at home.
Thanks Ohla for a great holiday.
Kirsty & James",5,2018,11,22
23,Perfect location,"Concierge were very welcoming especially Mata. They were happy to help with all our requests.
Hotel was perfectly located to visit all the main sights and also access to all the wonderful shops.
Rooms are spacious, clean and very well lit which we both loved.
Barcelona is such a wonderful city and beautiful so we are definitely coming back.
I would recommend researching where to eat as there are so many fabulous restaurants as the Spanish know how to enjoy relaxing during their meal and relishing their food.
There is lot of wonderful sights and I’d recommend using the on/off tour bus as you get an overall feel for the city.",5,2018,11,21
23,Satisfaction to the Fullest,"The Hospitality from Staff is welcoming & Helpfull, the Room is Awesome & Cozy, the Location is Awesome and the Breakfast is delicious. However, I do get clumsy with small elevators. Thanks for the memory staying in Barcelona.",5,2018,11,21
23,This hotel has everything!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel on our first trip to Barcelona. Everything about this hotel was perfect, from the concierge service to the great breakfast to the rooms, to the location...couldn't have asked for a better experience. We actually rebooked the hotel for another 2 nights on the same trip, with the exact same experience. 15 minute walk to the waterfront, 5 min walk to the metro, and 5 mins to Cathedral. No complaints at all and would highly recommend staying here to anyone.",5,2018,11,19
23,fabulous experience !!,"We stayed at this property for 3 nights at first floor. Had a fabulous experience.Everything was up to the mark.Staff was very friendly and helpful.The property is centrally located, 5 minutes walk from la rambla street and the metro station is just opposite the hotel.It was my husband's birthday and the staff was very generous to suprise us with a bottle of cava and even decorated our room.i am thankful to them for this effort.And not to miss their rooftop bar which has a excellent view of the barcelona city.
Would love to visit again!!",5,2018,11,19
23,Barcelona visit,"I loved Barcelona. And I loved Ohla hotel. It is situated in the heart of Barcelona on minutes walking distance from La Rambla, Gothic quarter, plaza Catalunia and other tourist sites.
The staff are wonderful and the service is great.",4,2018,11,19
23,Great,"I stay in hotels on a weekly basis and almost always in the high class business hotels. Now I stayed here for private reasons with my wife. Maybe Ohla is not a 5 star from a business perspective in luxury but for sure it is from a personal service point of view. When arriving we got a bottle of cava due to private celebration. The room is not big but quite, clean and a great shower. Breakfast is complete and fresh. Also her maybe not 5 star business but again the personal service is ok. The rooftop was also very exiting as well as the pool. Fitness is there as well as sauna, not very big but clean, looks new and well equipped. We would for sure be back!",5,2018,11,19
23,Great hotel centrally located great view from rooftop bar & pool,"Loved this hotel and the location was terrific.  The room was clean, comfortable and good size with Glass Shower which was part of our amazing experience.  Breakfast selections were great and alot of variety and the roof top patio was amazing with the views and the sangria after a day of walking or touring the city.   Too cold to use the pool, but it was very nice.  Check in was great and the concierge was very helpful.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone I know visiting Barcelona.  Thanks for a great stay.",5,2018,11,19
23,Great hotel and location,We stayed at Ohla Barcelona in November.  The rooms are very nice and the staff is very helpful.  They were great in helping us find a restaurant on our last night.  The location is also very good.  You can walk to anywhere in the Gothic district and even central Barcelona and the Metro is across the street.  We had a great time.,5,2018,11,19
23,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights in an essential room on the 2nd floor. Our room was spacious, quiet, very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. This 5 star hotel has excellent facilities, great breakfasts, and really enjoyed the roof top bar in the evening. All of the friendly, attentive staff made our short stay very special. This hotel is very well located for sight seeing in the city centre, just a 20-25 minute cab ride from the airport. Thank you very much for a very enjoyable stay. We hope to visit you again.",5,2018,11,12
23,Wonderful experience,"The Ohla is a delightful property in a terrific location.  The hotel is conveniently located in the Gotic district - a sort walk from just about everything.  We loved being able to stroll easily to restaurants, shops, and the sights of Barcelona.  Also, the staff at the hotel is wonderful.  The concierge team offered great suggestions and advice to help us make the most of our time in Barcelona.  I would strongly recommend the Ohla for your next visit to Barcelona.  ",5,2018,11,12
23,Fabulous hotel,We couldn’t fault the hotel . Loved our room - deluxe. Loved the roof top pool and bar . Great breakfast s and lovely staff. We had a complimentary bottle of cava in our room . Thanks guys . You made our trip special . ,5,2018,10,31
23,Slightly disappointing for a 5 stars hotel,"We have stayed one night in the Junior Suite. Overall it was a nice experience, very good location and service was good and overall nothing really bad to day. However, having experienced other 5 stars hotels, it felt more like they are not quite there. The room was nice but design was quite basic. Breakfast was OK. The Cava sent to our room was a nice gesture, however as it was of poor quality, so we opened a bottle and did not drink it and it was a waist- point saying, if you are giving a 5 star experience, you must assume that for many guests it is a standard and therefore if the gesture is of poor quality it’s defying purpose. We went to Caelis 1* Michelin. We have had an outstanding dinner with very attentive service, the only disappointment was the desert (a type of Ferrero) it was just not good, and quite surprising comparing to the divine dinner we had. 
So overall it was a nice experience but not my first choice next time we are in Barcelona. But also remember that all in life is relative, if a guest is a frequent 5* traveler he will expect something close to Perfection. If you are selling luxury- you should do some homework;)",3,2018,10,29
23,Perfect hotel experience in Barcelona ,"This hotel is absolutely perfect. The location in perfect, the room are beautiful and big , and the staff are unbelievable so helpful and friendly. If you are looking dor a perfect stay this is the place for you !
",5,2018,10,28
23,"Second Time, Just as Great","I stayed here 5 nights on business.

After a nice glass of cava on check in, I was shown to a great room, upgraded to a large size with a good window, although the view was mostly into the next door building. 

The location is great, waking distance from the old Gothic Quarter. The hotel has some great restaurants, including Caelis, a one-Michelin starred spot (though awarded in 2004). I tried all the restaurants and enjoyed them. I also enjoyed the rooftop pool and bar, although service was a little slow.

This hotel is great value, I'll be back!",5,2018,10,28
23,Glass shower,"I very rarely take the time to do a review but I felt it was important for others to know the glass shower centrally located in the room.  I was traveling with a group of friends, and I shared a room with a close friend.  Here are photos of our room.   The bathroom was totally open (except for the toilet).  Who would want to take a shower naked in the middle of the room while sharing a room with a friend???  This totally ruined our experience at the hotel as one of us had to either leave the
 room while the other was showering, or turn our backs to the shower.  The glass shower should have been pointed out by hotel staff at check in and clearly advertised when describing the hotel.   Would not stay at this hotel again unless there are rooms with private showers/bathrooms.

At check out, we advised hotel staff about our dissatisfaction with the glass shower, and were told that we could have had plastic brought to the room.  Not sure what this means but it should be in the room already if available.  

I will say the rooftop bar and views were spectacular and the staff were very friendly.

23,Fantastic Location,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Ohla.  This hotel is in a great location, although if you have a room facing the main street it can be a little noisy.  Everyone is very welcoming and helpful.  The concierge service goes the extra mile for anything you need, one of the gentlemen even came outside in the pouring rain to help us flag down a taxi!   We are a bit of foodies and the tapas restaurant was a delight! The rooftop bar has fantastic views!! Hardly any other guests were up there when we went every night for pre-dinner drinks.  

Rooms are spacious and clean.  I found the hotel to be a little dark.  Hallways are painted black as well as all the bathrooms.  The complementry water was a wonderful touch and they restocked it daily!",4,2018,10,26
23,Very helpful,"From the moment we walked in, the staff did everything they could to make our trip memorable and easy. They ensured that we had reservations for busy restaurants for dinner, helped book the best flamenco show, and even helped us navigate the trains for our day trip to the Dalí museum. We were always greeted with a smile by every staff and would stay again at this hotel when coming back to Barcelona. Thank you!",5,2018,10,25
23,If you could give a hotel a Michelin star...,"From the moment we arrived it was an incredible experience. Checking in included champagne and a seat plus a description and direction of all the best places to go nearby. Rooms were clean, airy, comfortable and romantic. They even an delivered an Italian brand of lip balm late one night when I needed it. Had dinner at the Michelin starred restaurant, had drinks at the roof (one of the best views in the whole city! We did several rooftop bars and this was by far the best), had breakfast in the café in the lobby and pre dinner drinks in the Vino bar. Additionally, the hotel is perfectly located to get to all the major attractions by foot but taxi's are readily available as well as the bus stop right in front of the entrance of the hotel.",5,2018,10,25
23,WOW,"The hotel is very centrally located. 
The rooftop terrace offers breathtaking views; the Sangria is very refreshing!
Breakfast has a variety of items.
The staff is wonderful and helpful!
I strongly recommend it!",5,2018,10,24
23,Modern and comfortable,"Ohla Barcelona is an excellent hotel in a great location.  Across the street from a metro station, a few blocks from the cathedral, and walking distance from the Gothic area and El Born with its famous tapas bars. Wonderful shops all around including a market across the street.  The service was excellent with a great concierge and a full buffet breakfast in the restaurant on the first floor.  The complementary bottle of Cava and flowers on arrival was a nice touch. Our room was good sized with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. All the windows had blackout drapes that blocked out the light, which was particularly helpful given our need for daytime naps to adjust to the 6-hour jet lag.  (I’d request a room near the top floor if you like a sunny room.) The bed was very comfortable, the mini-bar complete, and the bathroom very functional with double sinks and a great rain shower and bath tub.  This hotel has one of the best rooftop swimming pools and bars in Barcelona. Magnificent views any time of day and night.",5,2018,10,22
23,Good place to stay ,"A 5 star hotel, everything was perfect.

Pros: 
- Location is totally the best, everything is near you or few minutes walk.
- Very clean.
- Comfortable bed.
- Friendly staff.
- Lovely rooftop.
- Slippers are available in the room.",4,2018,10,22
23,Outstanding Service at Ohla Barcelona,"Simply put, Ohla Barcelona was the perfect place to stay during our trip. Located in the Gothic Quarter, it’s surrounded by gorgeous architecture and winding streets and alleyways that will take your breath away. It’s walking distance to tons of food and shopping and right along a main road (Via Laietana) which provides easy access to both the beach and taxis that can easily (and cheaply) take you the iconic Park Guell and Sagrada Familia. 

The staff was top class and the shining star of our stay at Ohla Barcelona. Our comfort was their top priority and they proved it day in and day out. They provided great recommendations, gave us easy to understand directions, helped us with booking rides around the city and allowed us to stay and relax when our departure flight was delayed. Classy and professional. 

The food/drinks at Ohla were great. They provide breakfast every morning from 7am-11am and the staff is very friendly. There’s a Michelin star restaurant located inside the hotel (which we did not get to try but it’s an option). The rooftop bar/pool are awesome and open late. 

Excellent for Families and couples!",5,2018,10,19
23,"Great location, great service.","Hotel Ohla Barcelona is centrally located and is renovated classical building. Although the renovations have been done to a high standard the don’t seem in sync with the design of the original building. Having said that the Superior room is ultramodern and comfortable. The service is great and there are three good restaurants on site. Close to Cathedral, the musical palace and not too far from the amazing waterfront.",4,2018,10,16
23,Wonderful stay,"This is a beautiful hotel, modern in its design, located in the Gothic district so just a walk away from just about anything around that area. You can walk to the Picasso museum, down to the pier, through the Gothic Quarters and all the shops and by all the various restaurants and cathedrals....Wonderful location.The staff at the hotel are great, helpful and friendly.... we had a junior suite which was lovely......breakfast was adequate but I would probably opt to not get breakfast included and eat at one of the many local eateries outside the doorstep.",5,2018,10,14
23,Amazing hotel - everything is absolutely perfect,"So i would say that the hotel is perfect from Alberto at the concierge desk to the reception and the dining room.
The only problems we had is that my wife is pregnant and therefore there are restrictions of what she can\not eat. 
The staff at the dining room tried to assist as much as they can.
I would definatly go back one day.",5,2018,10,14
23,Just perfect ,"My husband and I wanted to be centrally located in the Gothic district and near a metro and this was a perfect fit. We stayed for 4 days and each day the hotel staff helped us in some way. Albert works as concierge and always gave us good advice regarding places to go and things to see. We have stayed in many US hotels with breakfast included and this is by FAR one of the most diverse and delicious ones. A lovely staff waits on your every need there. We ate as early as 7am and as late as 10:30am and both were equally wonderful. Roof top deck allows for great views of the city, even if you don’t partake in drinks or the pool. Having such a relaxing room to come back to each day was wonderful. You will love your room. And turn down service with a chocolate on our pillow was a nice touch. We throughly enjoyed our stay and will stay again if we return.",5,2018,10,14
23,Barcelona's best concierge,"Firstly -- a fantastic location and a brilliantly staffed ,well run hotel.
On the first and last days of our stay we experienced demonstrations in the streets in front of the hotel which closed the street to taxi's .The concierge was unbelievably helpful in getting our transport organised .He even wheeled other patron's baggage 2 blocks down the  the road to a taxiThoroughly recommend this hotel -- plus their rooftop bar is sensational.",5,2018,10,08
23,Delightful place to stay in Barcelona,"Fantastic location conveniently placed for exploring Barcelona. We even found ourselves in the middlew of some Catlonian protests which were very festive and colourful!!

The hotel staff were extremely helpful and attentative. We had an excellent meal in the Tapas restaurant and enjoyed cocktails looking over the City from the rooftop terrace.

We would definitey return here.",5,2018,10,08
23,Great for a Barcelona visit ,"We stayed at the Ohla by the cathedral ( there are others it would seem) on recommendation
A brilliant position for walking around the city 
The rooms ( junior suites) were very modern but extremely comfortable. Unfortunately we had asked for quiet rooms but in order to have a view , at night the noise from the main road made it just a little noisy for me - admittedly I am a light sleeper and was the only one out of our party of 5 that was affected ! 
Beware of the dark bathrooms - very trendy and once you find the toilet ( hidden door) they are fine but making up ( ladies) is a little tricky ! 
All the staff were exceptional and beyond helpful 
Breakfast was fairly standard - not great but ok 
All that said I would definitely recommend the hotel - I had been told it was for the very young but we ( 60’s and a 90 year old ) did not feel out of place and would return should we get to Barcelona again 🤞",5,2018,10,07
23,Great Stay at Ohla,"Stayed for four nights during the annual la merce festival. Hotel is located walking distance from everything - great location with easy access to key sites and lively area to stroll around. Rooms and public spaces are clean and modern. Especially enjoyed the room layout and comfortable bed. Rooftop has a great view and is nice and quiet during the day for a swim. Staff are extremely hospitable, enjoyed a great welcome experience with Cava. Concierge was helpful in recommending and booking restaurants and sites. Additionally the Concierge team was a life saver in helping retrieve and ship a forgotten item at the airport (left my laptop as BCN security - Jose and the team helped retrieve it and ship it to back to the states). Breakfast was include in our rate and had a good mix of items. Would highly recommend - great facilities, amenities and hospitable service.",5,2018,10,03
23,Contemporary Hotel,"Stayed in the Ohla for 3 nights to explore Barcelona.  Contemporary styled hotel with unusual sculptures dotted around the hotel which was very much in keeping with the area.  Very friendly pleasant staff.  Room was clean and comfortable and had a walk in shower cubicle off the bedroom itself so prepare yourself for no privacy! Centrally located 5 minutes walk from the airport drop off bus and Gothic Area.  Breakfast was very average, recommend early breakfast as later on there are no plates/cups etc and eggs are cold.",4,2018,10,01
23,A must stay!,"We were a group of 9 family staying in 4 rooms. The reservation department was excellent in sorting our rooms and making sure that we were close to one another. 
The check in was easy and the kids loved the marshmallows and extra touches. The staff go out of their way to make sure that you are comfortable. 
The rooms are well appointed and modern. My husband and I had a basic room which was all we needed. The others had the jr suite or the junior suite with connecting room. We all had plenty of room and great nights sleep. 
The roof top terrace is amazing. The kids loved the pool and we loved the drinks and tapas. Excellent location, excellent staff. Cannot recommend highly enough!",5,2018,09,29
23,Stay here its a must do in Barcelona,"fabulous hotel at the centre of everything. Bus from airport drops you in Catalunya square and it's about 7 mins walk to hotel. the bus from outside the hotel takes you to the beach and back. It's on the edge of the gothic area so you can just ramble to las Ramblas. back to the hotel staff were excellent, friendly and could not do enough to help. Eat at there Michelin * restaurant. Its a treat we sat  up at the bar where you have 1st hand experience of watching the chef at work. Rooftop bar and pool a must plus barman really friendly",5,2018,09,26
23,Great Location and Great Service!,"Hotel Ohla Barcelona is centrally located for exploring the Gothic Quarter (old town)!  It’s also a short walk to the ports.  We absolutely loved the breakfast pastries and fresh fruit and juices!   The other restaurants were either closed or booked so we didn’t get to experience them, but, we found other great restaurants nearby.  The front desk staff, concierge, and valet were all extremely helpful and friendly!  The hotel is clean and well kept!  Out room was spacious, had a great rain shower, and lovely/nice quality toiletries!  We would absolutely stay at Hotel Ohla again!",5,2018,09,23
23,Excellent holiday,"We've just returned from a week at this lovely hotel. Our room, a junior suite, was a corner room so was lovely with three bright windows. 

The breakfasts were lovely. The roof terrace was beautiful with lovely views of Barcelona. We had tapas up there a few evenings.

The staff around the whole hotel were very friendly and helpful. The two concierges, Albert and Pablo were excellent and gave us great advice. 

The hotel is really well placed in the old town. We could walk down to the harbour in around 20 minutes. We walked to the Sagrada Familia in 35 minutes. Barcelona cathedral is just around the corner, and La Rambla is about 10 minutes walk. Most of the main places were, in fact, within walking distance.

We would highly recommend this hotel - our stay was lovely from our glass of Cava and strawberry dipped in chocolate on arrival to our departure. ",5,2018,09,23
23,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Just a few brief words to thank the staff for putting up with five raucous gents on our boys trip.  Service, Accommodation and sense of humour are all 2nd to none. Keep it going.  Everything but the olives....",5,2018,09,23
23,A beautiful stay in a special place,"We loved Ohla and would return.  All the staff were so nice;  the breakfast was terrific
and of course the location superb.  We enjoyed the room.  Our overall experience was wonderful.Loved the rooftop bar:  don't miss it at night!",5,2018,09,20
23,"Excellent location, service and staff","I stayed at Ohla hotel in 9/2018. The location is 10/10. Staff were really nice and very helpful. The hotel gives you a complementary phone with full service calling texting and 4G internet, throughout your stay, which was extremely helpful. I recommend this hotel and I'll visit it again to be in the beautiful Barcelona again <3",5,2018,09,18
23,Perfect getaway in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed at Ohla for a weekend and our stay was excellent! We had booked Junior Suite Deluxe but got upgraded to Dome Suite which was beyond our expectation. The Dome Suite is beautiful and spacious, overlooking the rooftops of Barcelona. The suite is equipted with everything you would need for a perfect stay in the city. Especially the lights are designed beautifully to highlight the dome. We ordered breakfast to our room and enjoyed it at the balcony of the Dome Suite, simply perfect. The music system in the room added the extra flavour to our stay. Could recommend Ohla to anyone seeking for a luxury stay in the heart of Barcelona. The rooftop terrace was perfect for a beach club chillout day by the pool.",5,2018,09,17
23,Stylish hotel in ideal location with excellent service,"Hotel is incredibly convenient - we enjoyed evenings walking through neighbouring Gothic quarter with endless supply of restaurants and bars.

Staff were impeccable and service was fantastic from the minute we arrived. They made our stay effortless. Staff acknowledged that this was our second time staying at Hotel Ohla and we were gifted a bottle of cava shortly after check-in - a clear sign they value their guests experience.

The hotel is beautiful, and the interiors are quirky and fun! Rooms are spotless and spacious. 

The pool is small and more of a decorative feature rather than a facility but we really enjoy the rooftop space. The chilled vibe in the middle of busy Barcelona was a dream.

Breakfast options were pretty basic and hot food was minimal (and not really that hot) but the dining space was nice and service was good.",4,2018,09,16
23,Look no further for 1st class service,"First visit to Barcelona on September 11, 2018 and selected Hotel Ohla based on it's great reviews. We traveled with friends and suggested they book here as well and we all were more than delighted with our stay here.
The first impression of the hotel was at check in which was incredibly intimate and personal. A one on one, sit down check in service where we were offered cool hand towels, something to drink, and our luggage was quickly ushered up to our rooms. Check in was at 3:00 pm, but they allowed us into our rooms upon arrival at 9:00 am so we did not have to wait (rarely if ever happens at any hotel, very much appreciated after an international flight).  The management (Javier) was incredible and provided us with1st class assistance. From our first day to our last day, the entire hotel staff was personable, professional, so very helpful with every need we had from taxi's, dinner reservations, tourist suggestions, etc.
The hotel - Gorgeous, boutique hotel. Decor is spotless and modern. Our room was a junior suite and had a fabulous view from the 5th floor of the city below. It was quiet and serene and very relaxing. There was more than ample space in the room which was simply but elegantly decorated. The bath area was immaculate and very high end. Loved it. They even provide you with a ""handy phone"" to use in the city! We used its GPS mapping to navigate the city AND all calls to the U.S (and many other countries) were free. Greatest feature offered ever as far as we were concerned.
We had drinks on their roof top which is beautifully furnished with many small tables, cabanas, and a beautiful pool (they provided the first 2 glasses of Cava complimentary). Had a buffet type breakfast each morning in their dining room which was more than adequate. The location of this hotel is in the Gothic District which is in my opinion, the most beautiful part of the city. We were central to everything we could want to see. Great shopping from high end stores to knick knack kiosks, many, many restaurants to choose from including lots of tapas bars and fine dining spots.
This hotel is in an ideal location and could not have been more perfect for a first trip to Barcelona (or for a repeat trip as well!) You will not be disappointed if you stay here. Service here is premier as are the esthetics of this hotel.
Thank you to all the staff of Hotel Ohla for providing us with such a great and memorable experience in your city.",5,2018,09,16
23,Wonderful stay at Hotel Ohla,"This was a fantastic place to stay on our last leg of our holiday.  The location was fantastic.  The room was very comfortable and modern with plenty of room.  The restaurant, rooftop bar and the bar downstairs provided us with ample choices after a big day out touring.  But most of the all the staff were very attentive and personable.",5,2018,09,15
23,Beautiful hotel! Great location! Wonderful service!,"Not only is this hotel in a prime location - walking distance to the best shopping, restaurants, cafes - but the design was beautiful and the service was the best! Also the rooftop pool/bar is just gorgeous! My husband and I came with my parents and our 6 month old baby. We had round trip tickets LA-MAD so we weren’t sure how many nights we wanted to stay in Barcelona. This was our 2nd time in the city but the 1st time in this hotel - the hotel was so wonderful and accommodating that during our stay, we were able to extend our nights there without changing rooms. They were very understanding and made this 2nd trip to Barcelona that much more enjoyable. Thank you, Ohla! We will definitely be returning soon! ~ the Morales Family",5,2018,09,12
23,Great Location/ Amazing Staff,"My husband and I just returned from our 2.5 week honeymoon through Madrid, Mallorca, Barcelona, and Florence (staying at 7 different places).  Of all of the places we stayed OhLa was in our top 2. From the moment we walked into OhLa we were treated like royalty. We were greeted with sparkling wine and delicious snacks. The woman who checked us in (sadly I can't recall her name) was absolutely amazing and helped us with some great tips. The concierge was also wonderful and helped my husband and I plan a little walking tapas tour (all his recs were delicious). Overall every staff member we interacted with was wonderful and made sure our honeymoon stay was the best it could be. The rooms were great with amazing amenities. And that rooftop deck was beautiful, with delicious drinks and gorgeous views. The hotel is located in a great location near Las Ramblas and several other great sites. I would without a doubt stay at OhLa again and I highly recommend it to anyone considering it.",5,2018,09,11
23,"Great Location, spacious/modern rooms, great roof top","This Michelin Star hotel is located in the center of Barcelona. The hotel provides you with free WiFi and a beautiful roof top infinity pool/bar area, overlooking the beautiful city. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,09,08
23,Recent stay,"I was very pleased with my recent stay at Ohla Barcelona. I appreciated the personal attention I received at check in such as complimentary water, chocolate covered strawberry, and almond biscotti. In addition, I also appreciated the hotel allowing guests to use the bathrooms and shower in the gym to freshen up while waiting for rooms to be ready. I also liked the availability of an iphone for use in Barcelona so you don’t have to use your own phone for making local calls and texts. Had I known about these great services in advance, I would have booked this hotel at the beginning of my trip when I had just arrived in Barcelona after a long and exhausting flight. Overall, the service and the amenities here are exemplary and everyone was extremely helpful. And to think, the primary reason I booked this hotel in the first place was for the view from the rooftop pool(which can’t be beat). I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,05
23,Great location & fabulous staff,"I just returned from a 5 day stay at Hotel Ohla and am happy to share my experience. The hotel is located at the edge of the Gothic quarter, a few blocks to La Rambla and Plaza Catalonia, so terrific location. The room (junior suite) was understated and elegant. The rooftop bar & pool a nice option during hot months. Breakfast was the best we'd had on our trip but the best aspect of Hotel Olha is it's people. Albert the concierge was extremely helpful with making recommendations and giving local tips. Miguel, also at the concierge desk, was very helpful and  Valentina, breakfast hostess, was on point as were the rest of the breakfast staff.
The whole staff went above & beyond. For example, one night when we decided to order room service, there was no cake left. The next night, we returned to our room to 2 pieces of cake and a bottle of Cava. Enough said?
The only possible negative is that the hallways are very dark in some spots as is the lobby and business center.
I hope to return soon as there is still much to explore in beautiful Barcelona.
Ciao!",5,2018,09,05
23,Wish we had longer to stay,"The welcome by the helpful and friendly concierge staff was echoed by the reception staff.  We got to sit down in comfort, with refreshments, one on one with a staff member to check us in.  Although we were too early to enter our room yet, we were advised that we could access the showers in the gym and also the pool and bar on the top floor in the meantime.  The room was spacious and the air conditioning was perfect. The shower set up has been mentioned by others, and while it is different, as long as nobody opens the room door while you are showering, it's fine!  They even have a turn-down (with chocolates on the pillow) service!  Every staff member we encountered was more than helpful and friendly, and I would recommend this hotel to everyone!  Breakfasts were a little average to our taste.",5,2018,08,31
23,Awesome stay,"I love the location of the hotel. In my opinion probably the best location in Barcelona for holidays. The hotel is impeccable in terms of service throughout the hotel and its services. Rooftop with lovely sitting areas and pool is super cool. Hotel has fantastic new Michelin star restaurant that is highly recommended. There is a great wine bistro which has super selection of wines etc. Hotel rooms are spacious, comfortable that in every way wonderful. For a five star hotel this is super option in Barcelona if you plan to enjoy the best things the city has to offer.",5,2018,08,29
23,Cool hotel in central Barcelona,"We have just come back from Barcelona and enjoyed our time in the Barcelona Ohla hotel. The roof terrace is really cool and the hotel has a general laid back atmosphere. The breakfast was okay, and the gym tiny, but the hotel itself was really nice we would visit again.",5,2018,08,27
23,Oasis in the cuty,"We arrived after a short but traumatic stay at the W hotel, we were welcomed by Belen and it was nice to be in the presence of a competent and friendly adult. 

The welcome, ambience and decor was just what we needed to chill out after our ordeal.

The room was well laid out and the bed was very comfortable, every inch a 5 Star experience.

After freshening up we went to the rooftop for a few drinks, pricey but worth it for the views and feeling of space.

The concierge was very helpful and gave us some great advice for dining out.

The pool and gym are fairly basic but ample with the bonus that the gym is 24/7.
Breakfast was low on choice but high on quality with the added bonus that it’s on til 11.",5,2018,08,26
23,Wonderful and relaxing break,"The hotel is perfectly located for exploring this wonderful city. The staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful and customer focussed, and the room (deluxe room) was large, clean and had great amenities. The roof top pool is stunning, great service and cocktails. We wouldn’t think twice about staying at this hotel when we return to Barcelona at some point in the future. ",5,2018,08,24
23,Amazing - Fantastic Hotel,"The OhLa was just fantastic in every way, the rooms and hotel were impeccably clean.  The staff go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.  The location is fantastic & the views from the roof top pool / bar are outstanding! 
5* hotel with a 5* feel, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2018,08,23
23,Nice Hotel,"The hotel staff are extremely helpful and catered to all our needs. The hotel is five star however i dont think the hotel room itself meets that standard. The rainfall shower was lovely but the hotel room was just too dark. The bed was very big and comfy, lots of storage space- just an odd long shape with odd corners for the bathroom and toilet. We didn’t eat at the restaurants but the menus looked great. The view from the roof was amazing.",4,2018,08,14
23,Great hotel !!,We loved Hotel Ohla Barcelona which is a beautiful hotel in a perfect position . Highly recommended for couples wishes to spoil themselves in a beautiful city . Our suite was spacious and very comfortable and the breakfasts were good too.,5,2018,08,14
23,Modern amenities and central location,"We stayed at Ohla a few night sat the end of our cruise.  It was a very comfortable hotel with great dining options, a gym and rooftop pool.  We were especially thankful for the location, as there was a taxi strike while we were in town.  The staff was extremely helpful in giving guidance on directions and the use of public transit.",5,2018,08,08
23,The Best!,"My husband and I took our first trip to Europe..Paris,Italy, and Barcelona.This hotel made us feel comfortable from start to finish. The people catered to all our needs and more. With the taxi strike going on,they gave us great directions how to use metro and other forms of transportation for sightseeing. The room was the best one on our trip.I would recommend this hotel anytime you are in Barcelona!Thanks Ohla Barcelona!",5,2018,08,06
23,Perfection in Barcelona,"Ohla wins the day!  My wife and I stayed for a few days after our cruise ended in Barcelona.  Staying at Ohla was an awesome way to end the trip.  From the great staff, to the contemporary decor, the location and proximity to all things Barcelona, and then the rooftop pool and bar.... couldn't have been better and we enjoyed every minute.  I won mega points with the wife by choosing Ohla for sure.  We will surely stay again when we return.",5,2018,08,06
23,Class and comfort in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed three nights in a junior suite at this fabulous hotel.  We were made to feel welcome on arrival and whilst our room wasn’t ready we spent a couple of hours at the awesome rooftop pool (a frequent haunt in the next couple of days).  The concierge found us to tell us our room was ready - indicative of the service attention of this hotel.  A very comfortable room with all amenities.  Excellent breakfast and although we didn’t eat in the evening in the hotel, this was largely as a consequence of its ultra-convenient location.  Highly recommended and ultra cool.",5,2018,08,06
23,"Amazing rooms, stunning views, and staff who go above and beyond","My partner and I saw a great deal for this hotel on Expedia, and as great lovers of rooftop bars, we were won over by the photos and decided to book it.

And wow, how lucky that we did! Our stay at this hotel was incredible from start to finish. Upon arrival, we were taken to a private check in area and told to take a seat. They then poured us a glass of cava each, and offered some strawberries. We were stunned, and at first thought they might have thought we were someone else!! The staff were so lovely and helpful.

The room was also very nice. The bed was super comfy and there was an iPhone device on a stand on the side. This was, as the concierge has told us, a ‘handy’ and was a free device we could with us around the city, and had free Google Maps and international calls. This was a LIFESAVER, and stopped my partner and I from getting lost many a time.

Now for the main attraction - the rooftop bar. This went above and beyond our expectations. The view was incredible, with Barcelona Cathedral right there in front of you. The staff give you free nuts and again were very friendly. The swimming pool was really cool, and was completely see-through! Which made for very good photos. The water was very cold, but a nice break away from the hot sun. 

Each morning we got free breakfast included, which we took full advantage of! It was a beautiful room, and is where the dinner restaurant is during the night, and you are allowed to go up for a very yummy buffet. 

This hotel is ideal for both short term stays but also for long-term visits, as there is a wide variety of restaurants and bars on the site. Sadly we did not get time to get in the Michelin star restaurant, but it looked incredible and gives us another reason to go back! The hotel is also perfectly located within the city, and is about 10/15 minutes from the beach and main attractions. 

All in all, this hotel is simply amazing and I cannot recommend it enough! ",5,2018,08,05
23,"great hotel, great service","A wonderful stay!  Perfect location in Gothic area near the Cathedral and Born Restaurant section - walking distance to all. Beautiful rooms and service.  Special commendation to one of the most exceptional concierge departments (yes, not just one person, but a department).  Take advantage and have them recommend places and arrange all for you. Made our stay in Barcelona perfect!",5,2018,07,28
23,Great rooftop bar and pool,"We stayed 4 nights at Ohla Barcelona. It is well located, close to La Rambla and Plaza Catalunya. Great check-in experience, and well-equipped comfortable rooms. Had a meal and all breakfasts in La Plassohla - great choice of fruit, cereals, juices, cooked, cold meats etc. The rooftop bar was perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail with a great view over the city. Concierges were extremely helpful, and recommended great restaurants every night. Would highly recommend.",5,2018,07,26
23,Wonderful stay and location.,"The location is perfect, central to everything. The rooms are ultra modern, comfortable and come with great amenities. The staff was also great, thanks to Albert the concierge and the whole staff we had great food recommendations. The roof bar is not to be missed, beautiful views and great drinks with a small pool. Highly recommend.",5,2018,07,24
23,Beautiful and in a great location!,"We had a fantastic experience at Ohla a couple weeks ago.  It was our first experience in Barcelona and we found this hotel to not only a great central spot for all we wanted to do (easy walk to the Ramblas and Boqueria market and central for other things) but also a great spot to end the day.  The rooftop bar and pool were incredibly relaxing and the staff was quite friendly up there. The view was fantastic which is what called us back each evening.

It didn't hurt that our first impression started with a great reception hostess (Belin?) and a lovely glass of cava.  They were able to allow us early check in and she ensured we were well set for our four night stay.

We also dined at Caelis onsite which was absolutely outstanding.  We've done Michelin starred restaurants before and this one stood out.  (separate review on Caelis)

The breakfasts at the restaurant below were a great way to start our day.  Our junior suite was a great choice too.  The size was huge compared to most city rooms so we had plenty of room to move around.  The corner nature of it made it plenty light filled too.

The decor of the whole hotel appealed quite a bit too. Classic in nature but modern touches....with Barcelona's artsy accents.

We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.....and we hope to soon!",5,2018,07,23
23,Perfect hotel,"Was there with my husbond for 2 nights. Perfect, fancy hotel. Got the feeling of luxury during check in. Strawberries with chockolate, cava and hot towls. Superb roof terrace. Expensive, perfect location, nice staff. Would book a stay there again!",4,2018,07,20
23,Amazing,"This was our second visit to the Ohla. This hotel is truely amazing. Staff very attentive, even left bottle of Cava in our room to celebrate boyfriends birthday - nice touch. Roof top pool and bar are so chilled-out just what is needed after day sightseeing. Hotel very central also. Will defo return again. Thanks again ",5,2018,07,20
23,Truly a 5 star experience,"Highly recommend staying here. The service was first class (from the chocolate dipped strawberries on arrival, to the turn-down service and the fantastic concierge who helped us book tickets before our arrival - thanks Jose!) The room was luxurious. The roof top pool and bar is a must after a hard day of sightseeing (recommend the jugs of sangria with cava). The restaurants (and breakfast) were also first rate. We'll be coming back!",5,2018,07,19
23,Fantastic Hotel and Great Staff,"Excellent hospitality and utmost care taken.
Home away from Home.
Center Location: All touristic sites and shopping area in walking distance.
It is small boutique hotel. Small but very exciting Gym, Sauna and Steam Area.
Very Good quality Amenities.",5,2018,07,18
23,A wonderful hotel for a birthday holiday,"My husband and I with friends stayed at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona mid-July, so yes it was warm but this was nothing to the warm welcome we received from the Ohla Barcelona staff. From the start of our stay to the end the staff were helpful, entertaining, and a joy to be around.

We had two main problems one was the need for gluten free, the other was a allergy to all fish and seafood. Our friends gluten free breakfast was brought out, cereal, muffins, rolls, and small pastries with the fresh fruit, juices and water this was a kings breakfast. (other hotels gluten free is two slices of bread) After the first morning we did not have to ask for her breakfast it appeared on our table within minutes. 

It was the first time for tapas for our friends and with the allergy and gluten free you would think this could be a problem but not for the la plassohla Aaron suggested items to try that fit all our needs and by the last day we had our favorites chosen with a gluten free sacher cake to share which was pre-arranged by Jose (birthdays 3 and 13 July) for our last evenings meal. The cake was delicious and being gluten free, gave our friend a taste of sacher cake which she was unable to do in Vienna.

The Ohla Barcelona is air conditioned and has a perfect location for touring with many attractions being within walking distance, the rooftop pool became our chill-out area at the end of each day, and with the Concierge team (thank-you again Jose) answering questions, and giving advice where needed, they even took steps to get us to the airport on time when our pre-booked taxi failed to arrive.

Thank-you to all at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona you gave us a wonderful experience of Barcelona.",5,2018,07,18
23,Our first 5 Star Hotel,"One of the best experiences ever. We had 4 nights booked here for my wife's 50th birthday. On arrival the concierge took our luggage and directed us to reception. We were greeted with Cava, juice, water, chocolate strawberries and biscotti whilst they booked us in. Our room was a junior suite and was very smart with a centrally placed glass shower and a very large bed. The air conditioning was brilliant as it was around 30c each day and it made it so much more comfortable. One of the highlights is the rooftop swimming pool and bar. It is above the majority of rooftops at about 10 floors high and the views are incredible overlooking the gothic cathedral. La Plassohla the ground floor restaurant was lovely and also doubled up for breakfast which was also plentiful and fresh. The staff were amazing. Jose the concierge took all our requests and made the visit amazing. Gustav the butler made sure anything we needed he could arrange. Aaron and Victor the waiters in La Plassohla were extremely attentive. As I have a fish/seafood intolerance and my wife has a gluten intolerance they catered for us with ease. Our introduction to tapas was incredible and the food was of the highest standard I have ever had. We will be visiting them again next year.",5,2018,07,17
23,just for holidays,"The hotel was on the perfect place , everything was near from the hotel, reception was very different to another hotels they offer champagne , different waters , chocolates , sweets and wet mini hand towels for clean your traveled hands  and people working in this hotel  were very attentive , professional , concierge was also very helpful kindly and attentive . Room was very clean , they make up our room twice a day with chocolates on the bed and good relax music , breakfast was very good but monotonous , but tasty. I live terrace it was very quite.
So if i come in Barcelona again i come to OHLA BARCELONA Hotel again .
And  what is most important is that beds were incredible perfect .",5,2018,07,17
23,Slightly disappointed,"We paid a lot for a room at the Ohla and were slightly disappointed that for a 5* hotel, expectations were not met.
 The lift didn’t work at times so we ended up taking the stairs to the rooftop. This was further complicated by work taking place, which meant wires and electric tools just left out and messy on the stairs. Definitely not safe for children.
Our room wasn’t cleaned- had to ask reception and this was awkward as we had to leave the room to allow the cleaning, plus coming back to a messy room not ideal after a long day of sightseeing 
The bar was lovely, but we had to stand for 10mins waiting for drinks, whilst the staff were aware we were there but continued with their work in the back.
I did enjoy my stay, it was just a shame it didn’t meet what I hoped for with a 5* hotel
Positives- amazing breakfast, staff were lovely, rooftop views were amazing and pool was a great dip!",3,2018,07,15
23,Excellent hotel,"We stayed for four nights and had a very pleasing experience, very helpful staff especially Concierge.  Location really good in central city.  Room all you could want.  Rooftop pool and Bar a great way to relax.",4,2018,07,15
23,Easy Stay,"Our stay at the Hotel Ohla in Barcelona was great.

We arrived around 11:00 am, and upon arrival they took our bags to deliver to our room. We met with reception who said the room would be ready by 3:00, and stored our bags for us in the mean time. Reception also helped us find some fantastic restaurants while we waited. In my opinion, their recommendations were better than any other recommendations we had from reception while in Spain.

We got our room at 3:00. It was spacious, cool, and had a decent view. The bathroom was very nice. The bed was big and comfortable. Decoration is modern. There was also complementary water which housekeeping replaced every day. I was so grateful for that! After ""siesta"" time, housekeeping will come through again and remake the beds, place a chocolate on the pillow, and give you information about the next day's weather. I felt so taken care of, and was super impressed!

The location of the hotel is also great. It is about a mile to the pier, 1.3 miles to the beach, two blocks from La Rambla, a mile from Parc de la Ciutadella, and close to many restaurants.  

The rooftop offers an impressive view. Drinks are very expensive, which makes sense when such a view is in high demand. The pool is a pool to relax in (not splash around in). The breakfast was in one of the restaurants attached to the hotel and was very good. In that same restaurant in the evening, they have a full menu, but the staff working in the restaurant was very frazzled. I wouldn't return to the restaurant. That is not a criticism of the hotel, though!

When we were ready to leave for the airport, the concierge called a taxi for us. The driver was very friendly and better than other random taxis we had taken in the city. 

Our stay was so nice, it's a shame we were only there for three nights! This hotel is comfortable, clean, modern, spacious, in a good location, and has great customer service. I would recommend it. In fact, if I return to Barcelona, I will definitely be staying at Hotel Ohla.",5,2018,07,12
23,"Beautiful Hotel, perfect location, outstanding service! Recommended","We stayed at Hotel Ohla for 5 nights in June 2018.  What a fantastic experience!

Check in was an experience on it's own!  Fresh from the airport, we were greeted by the concierge staff and our bags were taken from us and we were moved to the check in area 0.5 floors up from the entrance area.  We were taken to a seated check in desk and offered a lovely glass of Cava and some chocolate dipped strawberries.  The check in staff were all very pleasant, and we genuinely felt welcomed to the hotel and city.  Once checked in, we were advised our room would be ready in approx. 30 mins; we were then provided with a top up to our Cava and advised we were welcome to spend some time on the roof terrace until our room was ready.

The roof terrace was just delightful!  Beautiful views of the surrounding area and cathedral.  Lots of seating options (sun seats, loungers, table and covered lounge tables). The pool was a perfect size for a quick cool down.  My other half requested an off menu cocktail and the staff were more than happy to mix it up (he did say it was one of the best Dark and Stormys he's ever had!).  The rooftop staff were fantastic, we honestly could not fault them.  We also ate by the pool one day; the toasties, salads and chips were top notch.

Our room was great, it was the perfect size and had a modern layout with an open plan shower.  Housekeeping had great attention to detail; the daily service and turn down service were excellent.

Location of the hotel was great; a couple of minutes walk to the hustle and bustle to La Rambla and a large shopping street, an easy walk to the beach and Sagrada Familia and endless options to get lost on the cute cobble stone streets.",5,2018,07,12
23,My expectations were lofty from the website,"The location was pretty good.

The service was friendly but a little scattered at times.

The room was modern but poorly designed and felt to closed in with just one medium window.

Overall, it felt like so many of the 'Instagram hotels' that have popped up. They showcase a couple of nice features (not very clean rooftop 'pool' to try and get young people in and went to check in and realize it's not quite what you expected. Maybe I expected too much? Or is my taste for quality materials being used something I should stop seeking in a hotel?",3,2018,07,12
23,"Fabulous hotel, fabulous service, would highly recommend","We stayed at Hotel Ohla for a 3 night stay last weekend on a very rare break without the children! We were not disappointed. The hotel was everything we had hoped for and more. But what makes the hotel truly impressive is the staff. From the concierge, to the reception staff, the restaurant staff, the bar staff, the cleaners, they were all highly professional, helpful and polite. Nothing was too much trouble. Truly 5* service. The rooftop bar is a welcome haven to escape to after a busy day sightseeing where we were able to relax with a few drinks looking out over the beautiful city. Magical. Thank you to all the staff for making our trip so special. We would love to return one day.",5,2018,07,12
23,Absolutely Supreme!,"Some hotels manage in some magic way to get you - and just you - to feel really welcome. It's hard to tell the secret, but I think I've never felt so welcome at any hotel as I did when we checked in to Ohla Barcelona. Thank you so much!

We were only in Barcelona for one night before moving on, but this ""just one night"" became one of the best hotel experiences ever. We traveled 2 adults + 2 children and had asked the hotel to get two rooms as close together as possible. Firstly, we got two rooms that were linked with a separate hallway that only we had access to - something that felt very exclusive 😊
But secondly, we got two absolutely amazing rooms - one Design Deluxe Room and one Junior Suite. Amazingly beautiful and cool rooms - super modern

Then I have to mention the roof terrace! Fully equipped with pool, bar, delicious seating areas, sun loungers, bold music from a DJ and beautiful views over the city of Barcelona. Access to this roof terrace is perhaps worth the stay itself 😊

... and the kids says: ""super service"" as the best with the hotel. Can't disagree with that - the service was excellent.

Could this be the best hotel in Barcelona? As my wife sums it up: Nothing was wrong. EVERYTHING was beyond good. Well - maybe the elevator was a little slow :-D

These 24 hours were absolutely perfect and we have already begun to plan the next trip to this gem in the middle of Barcelona. And the fact that we did not have dinner at Chef Romain Fornell's One Michelin Start restaurant Caelis is a terrible shame, but gives us just another reason to return to Ohla Barcelona.

We will be back before the year is over 😊",5,2018,07,07
23,George ❤️,"Booked this hotel for me and my girlfriend as it had the best rating on experian.com. Unfortunately I lost my wallet on the way there and upon arrival I was panicking, as anyone would. But because I pre paid for the trip previously it was not a problem. A member of staff named George helped us out immensely, he phoned the airline we flew with and the bus company we transferred with to try and locate my wallet, gave us vouchers for the restaurant and upgraded our room!! A huge help! And really appreciated. Overall all the staff were fantastic, providing us with recommendations and directions. The breakfast was brilliant, the room was incredible, just an overall fantastic experience. Will hopefully going back very soon. Thanks again George for all your help!",5,2018,07,06
23,Good Hotel - Great Location - Great Service,"We stayed 3 nights. The hotel was nice (clean with comfortable beds, nice restaurant with good food in the hotel) but what we were most impressed by was the service from the staff. They welcomed us with glasses of Cava as well as rolled, wet towels to refresh ourselves from our travels as we checked in to the hotel.  We found the concierge staff, check in staff, wait staff and housekeeping all to be very pleasant and extremely helpful at every point throughout our stay whether we needed a restaurant recommendation, a taxi arranged, extra towels, or directions to a local attraction.   Our experience found all of the staff warm, welcoming and attentive to our every need. I realize this is not a typical review but more of a THANK YOU for such a great stay. ",5,2018,06,30
23,Lovely Barcelona ,"We started our three week vacation by staying at the Ohla for four days. We loved the central location, close to the Gothic quarter and all the fabulous restaurants and shopping to be had. The hotel staff greeted us graciously with complimentary cava when we checked in, a nice touch after a long flight. The room was very nice, clean and modern, however, my only criticism, and it’s rather a dealbreaker, is the design of the bathroom. It’s literally central to the room, you walk in, sink is on the right and the shower takes center stage, but here’s the kicker, it’s all glass except for one wall. Basically, zero privacy. The toilet is secreted away into a separate little room so thank goodness for that but I don’t understand the concept of such an open design. Not everyone feels comfortable doing their ablutions with an audience. The lighting in the sink area was also really poor, so for us ladies trying to look our best, not ideal. However, the service and rooftop pool were excellent as were the restaurants in the hotel, especially La Plasserol, tapas style and delicious! We didn’t get a chance to try the Michelin one but I am sure it is amazing considering the rest of what the hotel is offering. A very pleasant experience but regrettably would not return with those ridiculous bathrooms, unfortunately. Still a beautiful hotel.",4,2018,06,29
23,Hotel perfect located ,"This modern boutique hotel is perfectly located if you want to visit the city walking. Metro and bus close by.
Caring staff, nice rooms a small gym and a great view rooftop bar with a small pool.
Open bathroom maybe not for the typical „Hilton guests“, fitted for us. Glas-Shower in the middle of the room.",5,2018,06,27
23,Fabulous hotel,"This fantastic hotel contributed greatly in making our stay in Barcelona perfect. Great place to relax after exploring the city, having a pool to cool off in was blissful. Rooms well designed, very quiet at night, except Sant Joan celebrations which was to be expected. Excellent customer service without being over the top. Would highly recommend this hotel to others. ",5,2018,06,26
23,Great place to stay,"Nice hotel. Comfortable beds and pillows. The breakfast did not offer much choice. I wish there was bigger selection of fresh fruit. Juices were so watered down, totally undrinkable in my opinion. The reception staff were absolutely AMAZING providing the most couteous service during every single encounter. The bathroom amenities were great. Very helpful when you are traveling from counry to country. Enjoyed the afternoon drinks at the rooftop bar.",4,2018,06,25
23,Outstanding service at a beautiful hotel,"We took a family vacation to Spain to celebrity nephew’s graduation and stayed at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona.  The hotel is beautiful and the location is excellent!  If you are looking for a full service hotel this is the place to stay. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  They were very professional and welcoming.  You will get EXCELLENT SERVICE at this hotel. The restaurant attached to the hotel had a wonderful buffet breakfast and the hotel itself is beautiful and well appointed.  The beds were super comfortable and the location was quiet even though they have a bar which is a hopping night spot on the top floor.  Also on the roof there is a nice little infinity pool with lounge chairs and gorgeous views of Barcelona.  The only caveat is the room has a modern and contemporary design and the shower is enclosed with clear glass on three sides. The shower is somewhat in the middle of the room, so if you are traveling with someone and you don’t want them to see you shower you might want to ask about a different room. That is really the only drawback I could think of this hotel as everything else was top notch. The shower didn’t bother me, but it might be a concern depending on who you are traveling with.",5,2018,06,24
23,"Fabulous hotel, great location ","I can’t recommend Ohla enough, we loved our 5 night stay. 
When we arrived we were offered water, Champagne and sweets, always a winner. 
The concierge were very helpful and friendly and sorted us out with a discount on the open top bus. 
Breakfasts were well run and always tidy and had everything required. 
The rooftop pool / bar was such a bonus and felt like a bit of luxury in the city. 
The shower in our room was glass and in the centre of the room which may not be appropriate if staying with family/friends(!) but the beds were very comfortable with a great turn down / make up service. 
The location is perfect, walkable to the beach and near to a metro station. Our room was very quiet although faces onto the main road.  
I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others! ",5,2018,06,24
23,Just The Right Stuff,"Every aspect was"" Just right"" during our stay this May at The Hotel Ohla Barcelona 5 Star Hotel. Just the right location, Just the right amenities, Just the right extremely helpful and caring staff. Just the right quirkiness - with large ceramic eyeballs decorating the out side towers of the hotel-- to let you know you are in the city that Gaudi ""built."" Although located in the heart of town near the Saint Eulalia Gothic  Cathedral, Las Rambles, Marina, Palau de la Música, and the central tourist bus route, inside the hotel and rooms there is an air of quiet calm and stability in an otherwise bustling , hectic city. When we go back to Barcelona, we will stay here again for sure and enjoy more tapas in the spectacular rooftop terrace bar with a 360 degree view of the city.",5,2018,06,20
23,"Excellent location, impeccable service & a tranquil roof top bar / pool","I have stayed in many, many hotels worldwide & for the welcome, hospitality and overall feeling of being cared for the Hotel Ohla is up there in the top five (and most of the others were way more expensive). 
I would recommend the hotel Ohla unreservedly.",5,2018,06,19
23,Perfection!,"Recently returned from a wonderful stay here. The staff were exceptional. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted with a smile. Excellent check in, very quick and professional. 
Our trip was a surprise for my husbands 30th birthday (which also fell alongside our wedding anniversary) we had a lovely surprise bottle of champagne waiting for us in our suite on arrival and another bottle with lovely message on the day on our anniversary. 
Nothing was too much bother, the turn down service was brilliant. Housekeeping were very friendly. 
Breakfast was nice, nothing amazing but perfect for what you need. 
We also had a beautiful meal at Caelis, we were on the chefs table and all staff were so welcoming making it was wonderful experience. Highly recommend a visit to the restaurant. 
Roof top was lovely, pool isn’t very big but it does the job. Again, lovely staff and the views are stunning. 
We would highly recommend this hotel, the location is great (if you don’t mind walking) taxis are cheap. It has a personal touch you don’t get with larger hotels, it has an apartment feel to it, more than a hotel. Exceeded my expections. 
Many Thanks to all the staff for making our stay so memorable. We will be back!",5,2018,06,17
23,"Lovely hotel, great location","We’ve been to Barcelona several times and have stayed here twice. We would happily stay again. Fantastic service, nothing is too much trouble from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. There is a romantic feel to the hotel and there are several packages available to enhance the experience even further. There is a good rooftop bar with pool, although no sun loungers which is a little disappointing. There is another bar and a restaurant on site which serves a very good breakfast.
The location is fantastic with so much in close walking distance.",4,2018,06,16
23,Ohla’s won a repeat customer ,"The best welcome at check in I’ve had at a hotel and I’ve stayed in a few!  Super room. Modern decor lovely shower that’s easy to use, free bottles of water, spotlessly clean and a massive bed.  Location is great, very central in gothic quarter, a couple of minutes walk to La Rambla.  One star Michelin restaurant, which strangely for us we did not eat at as there’s a massive choice of eating places in the area. Tapas restaurant which was excellent when we ate there on our first night. Rooftop bar with great views and friendly staff. Staff were brilliant throughout the hotel. When we come back to Barcelona I will be booking at Ohla again. ",5,2018,06,14
23,Only place I'll ever stay in Barcelona!,"We had the most incredible experience at Hotel Ohla last week! We had originally booked Sun-Wed but due to flight cancellations we decided to remain in Barcelona the rest of the week. Marta and the hotel staff were so kind and accommodating getting us back into a room. Beyond their amazing customer service, the hotel is just stunning! From the room to the beautiful rooftop pool everything is immaculately clean and just lovely . It is truly an amazing property all around. The staff are all so friendly and they go above and beyond to make the stay comfortable and memorable.",5,2018,06,12
23,Really good experience,"very well located hotel. It is really close to plasa Catalunya, which is the center of the city. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and modern. We also had dinner on the rooftop terrace and it was perfect. Thank you Ohla Hotel.",5,2018,06,12
23,Boutique Luxury,"Stayed there 2 nights in June.  We arrived by plane in Barcelona and headed straight to the hotel.  Upon entering, we were greeted immediately by the concierge. We were escorted to the check-in desk and were offer water, juice or Cava, a spanish prosecco .  We chose the Cava while we filled out the paperwork.  We had a beautiful modern inspired junior suite with great views. Moments after our arrival we had fresh flowers, chocolates and a bottle of Cava sent up to our room. Very nice touch! We had breakfast included which was a nice buffet. Omelets were also offered.  The location was great.  Everyone was extremely helpful and professional.",5,2018,06,11
23,First class hotel ,"We stayed here for 3 nights and were impressed from the beginning.  We were greeted with choice of lemon or mint water or cava and chocolate dipped strawberries.   The staff is so helpful with restaurant recommendations, activities, even having umbrellas ready (as we needed during a rainy spell).  The rooms were spacious and the special touches, nightly turn down service and quality shampoo, lotion etc ,give Ohla extra points!   The rooftop pool/bar gives gorgeous view of area and the buffet breakfast was good quality.   Best was the very central location to the gothic center, beach not far, great restaurants and shopping!!!!",5,2018,06,09
23,Fantastic stay,"We had a wonderful first stay in Barcelona and for the price of the hotel I thought a fair value.
Pros:
Amazing roof top with pool dj’s, food and drinks. Great views.

Service was excellent. Welcomed with a glass of Cava and a smile on everyone’s face. Very welcoming and laid back not pretentious.

Breakfast was very good. Large selection. And nice restaurant.

Centrally located.

Cons:
Bathroom was way too dark. Putting on my makeup was a task.

At breakfast would have been nice to know I could order specifics. I only found that out once I saw someone else order.

Food at roof top is pricey. 

Would I recommend this place? Yes definitely! 

",4,2018,06,09
23,Great Place to Stay in Barcelona,"This was a great place to stay. I was looking for a small, boutique hotel and this fit the bill. From the moment I walked in, the staff was professional, friendly and attentive. Check in was quick and easy. Whether it was getting tickets to an attraction or getting a taxi, the Ohla staff was always on point. I always felt comfortable and safe during my stay.
The service was great; my room was always made up when I returned.
The hotel is located in the Barri Gotic area, and is an easy walk to La Rambla, the Cathedral, and Barceloneta, as well as other places of interest.",5,2018,06,08
23,25th Wedding Anniversary,"We stayed 1 night at the Hotel Ohla celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary prior to a Med cruise. This hotel certainly deserves it's 5 star rating, what a fabulous experience. Our flight to Barcelona arrived quite late but we warmly greeted by Jorge and were delighted when he informed us that they were able to upgrade our room and Javier provided a bottle of Cava for our 25th wedding anniversary. The roof top bar and pool has a stunning view of the city. We only wish we could have spent a few more nights at the Ohla. Hopefully we will return for another visit.",5,2018,06,08
23,Sky's the limit!,"Fabulous and very well located hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms are very comfortable with good facilities.  I requested an extra pillow (I'm greedy and like three!) this was graciously delivered within minutes of the request.
Superb chillout rooftop terrace. I could have spent all day there.
Minor picky issues were the Buffet-style breakfast, which was fine in content, but for a 5* hotel the breakfast area is a bit dis-jointed and congested and should have included a more inclusive range of dietary requirements, and although it was available to make in my room, I prefer espresso coffee in the morning with my breakfast over filter coffee.
Overall a fabulous hotel, I really enjoyed my stay here.",5,2018,06,07
23,Exceptional Stay at Hotel Ohla Barcelona,"This hotel definitely has earned a five star rating! Excellent service, atmosphere, especially the roof top bar and lap pool. The breakfast spread was incredible. The location is outstanding in the Gothic Quarter. A quick walk to La Rambla, the aquarium, museum, cathedral & Plaza de Cataluna. La Sagrada Familia Church is only a short distance via the metro. This city is so easy to move around in. If you choose this hotel, you will not be disappointed.",5,2018,06,05
23,Long weekend in Barcelona,"This hotel is a ""must"" if you are visiting Barcelona . A good location in the centre of Town , friendly staff and an outstanding concierge . Rooms are great , and the roof top pool and bar are spectacular . We didn't try the restaurants but the wine bar was good and one night we ate on the roof top which was excellent . For what you get , it's value for money .",5,2018,06,04
23,Great ending to our honeymoon,Wine and Tapas bars were amazing.  Roof top pool bar is a great spot to start off or end your evening in Barcelona.  Staff from front desk to every corner of the facility were extremely accommodating.  Jose and Albert helped us get in and out of the city as well as made some great recommendations for what to see and how to see it.  If locals recommend a restaurant you must go.,5,2018,06,04
23,Fantastic Stay,"We recently visited Barcelona and wanted to stay near the Gothic Quarter - so decided to stay at Ohla. 
Before I talk about the hotel, I would like to say that it is superbly located - in a nice area and right next to the metro station and bus stand. 
Now about our stay - 
1) the rooms were great with all amenities. We got upgraded so that was great. The room received good sunlight and the bed was super comfortable. With no separation between the room and bathroom the room looked spacious as well. 
2) The service was excellent. Right from the time we checked in to our checkout, we were pampered. we were made to feel very welcome and comfortable and were very well looked after. The staff (reception, room service, concierge) were polite and helped with all our needs. 
3) the roof top bar has superb views of the cathedral 
All in all we had a fanastic stay at the hotel and will definitely recommend it to others as well.",5,2018,05,31
23,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel was perfect. Expensive but worth the money. The rooftop bar is stunning, rooms are beautiful, clean and very comfortable and the staff is lovely. They were very welcoming from the moment we arrived until check out. Miss it already.",5,2018,05,30
23,"Great central location , roof top bar spectacular","Stayed here for  4 nights during a recent visit on recommendation of trip advisor and found the location to be great ( most areas of interest within walking distance) and overall hotel as well . We also booked the suite on the 7th floor which was absolutely fantastic , the layout and space was brilliant.The roof top bar is spectacular and a must visit for great views over the city. We did not eat at the restaurants at night as we wanted to explore the city ,but we did have breakfasts and these were the most disappointing of all , the variety of the breakfast for a hotel of this stature was not great.
The staff were also very accommodating and I would recommend the hotel , as before just the breakfast service not of same standard.",5,2018,05,26
23,Great hotel in great location,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Ohla Barcelona. We don't normally pay as much as we did here for a city break but it really was worth it. The hotel is fantastic. We had a standard room which was very nice (coffee machine, comfortable bed, walk in shower, bottled water, toiletries etc). 

We chose this hotel because of location. It was well worth it as we could walk to everywhere we wanted to go.

The staff are very friendly and all really love Barcelona. We decided one evening that we wanted to go to Sagradia Familia the following day but knew there would be issues with queues. We spoke to the concierge who just pre-booked everything for us in a couple of minutes and probably saved us a few quid also. If you do stay at this hotel, do make use of the concierge as they know a lot about the city.

We also went to the hotel wine bar for tapas which was excellent and the views from the bar on the roof are absolutely amazing.

We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,05,21
23,30th Birthday Junior Suite Stay,"This is one of the most gorgeous hotels I’ve stayed in. It was for a special occasion so we booked a junior suite, and my goodness it was worth paying for. We stayed in Room 611 and this was a really lovely and spacious space for us to be in for 5 nights. We didn’t want to leave. Slept really well as the curtains totally black everything out and as the room was at the back of he hotel it meant there was little outside noise. The shower and bath are great too. There’s an iron and hairdryer in the room and makes a change that the hairdryer was actually powerful unlike some hotels I’ve stayed in. The iron is ok but I ended up steaming my clothes in the shower as there’s a handy hook in there to do that. We also had a bottle of cava on arrival waiting for us and a small bottle of red wine on my birthday which was a nice touch. We also thought that the staff were really helpful and couldn’t fault the service. Breakfast was nice and simple and we enjoyed the fresh pastries, fruit and selection of eggs, sausages and bacon. Well worth staying here and well worth upgrading. Also the rooftop bar is very lovely and we spent a couple of nights out there enjoying the views and a glass of wine or two. ",5,2018,05,18
23,Fine hotel in great location ,"Cannot emphasize the benefit of the location.  Not far from where the airport bus stops at Plaza Catalunya and ideally situated for all the usual monuments and the Barri Gotic.  The warmest of welcomes accompanied by perhaps a tea, coffee of glass of most excellent cava.  Also perhaps a complimentary bottle of cava in your delightfully appointed room.  Helpful friendly staff, nice dining facilities and roof terrace.  A great choice in Barcelona.  Really lovely linens and toiletries are supplied in the room.  We enjoyed our stay immensely.",5,2018,05,16
23,Beyond our expectations,"This hotel is centrally located and caters more toward couple or families with teens.  The staff is over the top helpful from arranging rides, making restaurant reservations or suggestions to booking sightseeing adventures,  As you check in you are offered cold cava and chocolate covered strawberries.  The room are well appointed but on the smallish side.  To our surprise we were given a free cellular phone to use for calls, data and especially useful for google maps.  They have a Michelin star restaurant, a tapas bar, a wine bar and a rooftop bar with amazing city views.  You are steps away from shopping and sites.  The beds were comfortable and the rooms quiet.  I would strongly encourage anyone to stay here when they come to Barcelona",5,2018,05,14
23,An unforgettable stay!,"After a few weeks of researching hotels in Barcelona, my girlfriend and I settled on this one. And we made the best decision ever. Ohla is incredible, in every way. If you're stuck between hotel options for an upcoming trip, book Ohla and don't think twice. First of all, we were greeted with a complimentary glass of Cava upon check in. Doesn't seem like THAT big of a deal, but it's one of the little things that they do here to make you feel special. In fact, they treat you like you're the only guest in the hotel. The concierge at this hotel are top notch. I tried to get all of their names but sadly couldn't. Miguel and Daniel are two that I specifically remember, but they were all great! We asked daily about restaurant + tour recommendations and they were always willing to take the time to speak with us about tips for seeing the city. 

We booked a Junior Suite, which is obviously a bit extra but honestly SO worth it. I didn't see what the standard rooms looked like, but the Junior Suite gave us plenty of space. The bathroom is massive and the shower (rainfall) is amazing. One cool thing about this hotel is they give you a ""Handy phone"" in every room, which you can use free of charge. It's great for people who don't have data plans and are relying on the hotel wifi. You can bring it out with you and use it like a regular cell phone as you roam the city. Overall, we were more than happy with our room choice.

Breakfast was included in the room price, and while we only used it 2 of the 5 days, it was a nice perk. The breakfast buffet is in La Plassohla, and it had everything you needed (eggs, bacon, yogurt, cereal, fruit, pastries, etc). We also tried the wine bar which was a fun spot to go to before dinner for a glass of wine + cheese plate. The roof deck at this hotel is truly incredible. We were up there every night for at least an hour. You can lay by the pool, enjoy a drink, or even order food. Great for relaxing or a before-dinner drink/bite to eat.

The final thing I'll say about this hotel is that the location cannot be beat. That was a big concern of ours as we researched hotels in Barcelona. Since we hadn't been there before, we wanted a hotel that was centralized. Ohla was exactly that. 10 minutes to Ramblas. 10 minutes to Passeig de Gracia (shopping street). 25 or so to Sagrada Familia. And you're right in heart of the unbelievable Gothic Quarter. 

Stay in this hotel. You won't regret it.",5,2018,05,13
23,Best Staff Ever!,"My 85 year old mother and I stayed here during one of the busiest times of the year in Barcelona. It was packed on Sant Jordi day. My mom was in a wheelchair and we needed to go to the train station. It didn't have any porters or anyone to help us locate our train. Our Concierge Pablo arranged our ride and went above and beyond in navigating the best way to get to the station. He sent his co-worker Miguel with us to the train station. He carried our luggage, found someone to escort us to the train and help us with our luggage. He and the train employee also arranged for a friend to meet us in Bilbao late at night to help us with our luggage and arrange transportation to our hotel. I don't know of any other hotel who would do that. They were AMAZING!!! The hotel is also very, very nice. Great location. Thank you Pablo and MIguel!!!",5,2018,05,08
23,Well located. Between other great buildings ,"Luxury hotel. Even though the price is rather high for what you get. Elegant facility and building in the heart of Barcelona next to the Rambla.
Swimming pool very small on a small terrace. Easy to move around from there.",4,2018,05,08
23,Great Wedding Anniversary Trip!,"Just returned from a wonderful child-free weekend break here for our wedding anniversary.
Was exactly what we were hoping for - luxurious, non-pretentious (not always a given), really welcoming staff (their Reception staff in particular were brilliant), delicious breakfast & excellent location.
We were greeted with a delicious glass of Cava, which we finished off on the roof terrace after checking in. On the one day a few spots of rain were forecast, we were offered an umbrella to borrow.  Couldn’t really ask for more - we walked everywhere easily, though the great chaps on the concierge desk could arrange transport/ tickets/ whatever else you might need. 
Would highly recommend, though ideally to adults as I want to keep it pristine for the next time we visit!",5,2018,05,06
23,Perfect way to start our vacation!,"We flew into Barcelona a day early for our cruise and stayed at Ohla Barcelona. What a beautiful hotel and the staff was so friendly and helpful. We had the option to pick our pillow types and scent for the room which was amazing. There is a smart phone that you can take with you to explore Barcelona! Service was amazing. The breakfast was delicious. Overall, this has been one of the best hotel experiences for my husband and I. I highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2018,05,02
23,The most stunning hotel in the perfect location,"This hotel is brilliant and when I return to Barcelona, this is exactly where I'll be staying . The service is outstanding, from the extremely friendly check-in with the welcome glass of cava to the concierge service available throughout the trip. We stayed in the design deluxe room and it was stunning! It was my boyfriend's birthday whilst we were visiting and the staff were excellent at helping me organise a few surprises for him. The location of this hotel was perfect as it was right in the centre of where we wanted to be! The rooftop had fantastic views also. I would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to return!",5,2018,05,01
23,City Break,Loved it here. Clean airy contemporary room. Excellent and helpful staff (would never have discovered the T10 bus ticket without the help of the concierge.... only sorry I didn’t get his name). Perfect location in the gothic quarter. Wonderfully warm and welcoming receptionists. Great rooftop pool and bar. We’d go back here without a doubt. The free phone was fantastic and we were there on St George’s day and were the recipients of the traditional gifts of a book and a rose which we loved. ,5,2018,04,30
23,Barcelona at its best at The Ohla!,Everything about the Ohla was wonderful! We arrived from the port way earlier than our check-in time. The concierge stored our luggage and showed us on a map highlights of the city. We checked in at reception and made our way into the city to explore all the Barcelona had to offer. Our room was amazing and the hotel staff was aHistoryrsone! The rooftop bar has awesome views. The breakfast was spectacular also. I would travel to Barcelona just to stay at The Ohla!,5,2018,04,29
23,Sant Jordie day in Barcelona,"Hotel facilities & rooms are very clean, attractive and worth the rate. The breakfast is terrific. I happened to be in the hotel the eve of Sant Jordie day and the evening maids gave me a red rose (which I gave to an attractive lady the next morning) and a book. Nice touch.",5,2018,04,28
23,Exceeded our expectations!,We are world travelers and Hotel Ohla Barcelona provided the most excellent service we have ever experienced. They even provided a lovely picnic lunch for us as we had to leave at 4:30 a.m. for the airport! We have shared our experience with friends and family and highly recommend this hotel in the heart of the city.,5,2018,04,23
23,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for our 25th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Check in was speedy and the glass of cava was a real treat after travelling. The rooms are stylish and clean. The roof terrace bar is great to enjoy a glass of wine after a long day sightseeing. We also ate in the two restaurants and had a drink in the wine bar. Perfect.
The hotel is close to lots of sights and the concierge were very helpful with directions and calling taxis.
Would definitely stay again and need to revisit Barcelona as there is so much to see and do.

We would",5,2018,04,23
23,Cool hotel with fabulous tapas,"Stayed for three nights in April. Great boutique hotel in central location - minutes from La Rambla, a thirty minute walk to Sagrada Familia. The hotel is surrounded by shops and bars. Cash point, bus, tube right by the front door. Concierge extremely helpful - booked our tickets for Sagrada Familia, called taxi to airport for us, stored our luggage until 6 pm on checkout day etc. The tapas restaurant was excellent, and breakfast was fantastic. We also had tapas and cocktails on the roof terrace - which had a great atmosphere both during the day and at night. The hotel also boasts a Michelin star restaurant and a wine bar. There is a small gym and sauna. Our room on the fourth floor was quiet, no noise from adjoining rooms or corridor.  Toiletries and tea/coffee etc were really nice (Nespresso machine). Turn down service. We didn’t have any complaints 😊",4,2018,04,22
23,Great location and wonderful service,"Right in the centre of Barcelona, everything is practically in walking distance. Service on arrival was phenomenal.. glass of cava and dipped strawberries in chocolate. Lovely rooms, very comfortable and though we were at the front of the hotel, with a lovely view, it wasn’t noisy. ",5,2018,04,22
23,Wonderful Stay,"Hotel is newly updated, location is a great. Easy access to most of attractions and also, taxi is inexpensive in Spain anyway. Hotel’s concierge services are great and staffs are really nice. I will come back next time if I ever come back to Barcelona.",5,2018,04,18
23,Quick pass through,"Due to the French strikes, managed to return to the UK through Barcelona. Stayed one night at Ohla with my 8 yer old son. Check in was a great experience. I was given a glass of champagne and my son some sweets. Quick, friendly and professional. Room was the right size, nice glass shower in the middle of the room. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast was ok. The basics. Concierge recommendations were spot on.
Highly recommend a stay there.",4,2018,04,17
23,Excellent Hotel Central Location,"Arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the Concierge and taken to Reception. We were offered a glass of Cava and a strawberry in chocolate, a great reception. We told the Concierge that we were celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the date we met, a couple of days later. The room was excellent, very clean and comfortable. On Friday we came back to our room to find a message of congratulations and a bottle of Cava on ice, what a treat. All staff we met were very helpful and caring.I would recommend this hotel unreservedly.",5,2018,04,17
23,Excited to return,"Hospitality beyond expectation; great location near cathedral and on the edge of the gothic area where I wanted to be.  Easy walking distance to many things. Rooms very nice, clean, comfortable.  Staff so accommodating and you will feel so special. Rooftop view is a bonus, although I would stay here again anyway.  Only two comments - restaurant staff could have been friendlier, but were competent, and I wish windows would open for fresh air.",5,2018,04,16
23,Gorgeous Ohla Hotel,From the moment my husband and I arrived at Ohla the service was impeccable and all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The little surprise touches were really appreciated. The hotel is in a great location and has a beautiful roof top terrace and a small pool where we spent time enjoying the fabulous views and lovely tapas and cocktails. Breakfast was great and we ate in both hotel restaurants. Caelis was an absolute treat the tasting menu with wine pairing was superb.

23,"Faultless, Flawless and Great Location ","From the moment we arrived in the hotel; we received a warm welcome from concierge; check-in met with a cold glass of cava. 

The hotel itself is beautifully decorated; we were upgraded to a spacious room overlooking the Main Street. Rooms are furnished to a high standard with superb attention to detail. 

Every member of staff we came across in the hotel made us feel incredibly welcome and could not have done anymore to feel comfortable during our stay. 

Concierge were superb with planning our stay! 

The hotel is in a great location in the gothic area; located very close to the Cathedral. Everything you need is very much in walking distance. ",5,2018,04,12
23,Best in town!,This is a modern hotel. I usually don't like it modern but this one is an exception. Especially when you hit hard and go for the suites. Very nice and luxurious rooms. Nice pool on the roof. The staff are all pros. The Ohla Bar is not big but the bartenders are world class masters. Ever had a drink with the music of the james bond theme...,5,2018,04,10
23,Relaxing and Central,"We arrived at the hotel around 1am from London, tired and weary. Edwardo made the check in process smooth and very pleasant, offered us cava and showed us to our room. Nothing was too much for him. We are having a very good enjoyable stay.",4,2018,04,05
23,Great hotel,"Really lovely hotel and well situated to explore Barcelona.
Check in was smooth and quick. We booked a junior suite which looked out onto the busy street which we really liked. The room was really clean and well equipped.
All the staff were extremely helpful and the concierges have been wonderful helping us book things and recommending places to eat.
Have very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely return to the Ohla if we are lucky enough to come back to Barcelona.",5,2018,04,05
23,Hotel with very good location in Barcelona ,"Very convenient location at the edge of Gothic quarter walking distance from all major attractions. Sagrada Familia is a bit far but still ok, other places are well within reach. Clean quite rooms, good service, very helpful staff. Breakfast could have been more substantial but that’s just my personal view, my wife was quite happy.

Open bathroom concept is something I have difficulty with, personally I would like some more privacy when I travel not alone. For one person it’s not a problem though.

All in all, my ranking would be 4+ out of 5",4,2018,04,01

23,Fantastic hotel in a central location,"We stayed for 4 nights on B+B basis- well worth doing- greta breakfast!
The room we had booked was a junior suite deluxe, this gave us a very large well appointed room and bathroom. Unusual design where you can lay in bed and see the bathroom ( not the loo!), and good features.
Great to be 5 floors up away from street noise and slept very well.

All staff very helpful, especially Concierge and reception staff.

Will stay here again for sure !",5,2018,03,21
23,Excellent hotel,"Hotel is very central to all tourist attractions. Beautiful clean well designed rooms. Staff are very helpful and polite. Shops, chemists, supermarkets are all very close by. Lots of quirky little lanes, filled with shops open till 9pm. Big shopping malls close by with all the big high street names (except Sunday)
Rooftop terrace would be excellent in slightly warmer weather (we visited March) Great views of the city right down to the sea.
Really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend",5,2018,03,20

They have banks and restaurants close to the hotel and a small market right across where we purchased water, wine and snacks. Everything was walking distance. We landed around 10am and the hotel staff helped us check in early. Oh yea we were upgraded as well thanks to Expedia. ",5,2018,03,18
23,Excellent boutique hotel,"On visiting Barcelona to watch football I chose to stay overnight at this hotel. The location is excellent with a Metro station close by. Its a short walk to the cathedral and la Rambla, check in was excellent with a glass of Cava on tap. The rooms were well equipped and modern and had every amenity that you would want. There is a roof terrace with a pool and bar which I can imagine in summer would be well utilised. Breakfast was excellent and there is a michelin starred restaurant (which i did not have time to explore unfortunately). All in all an excellent hotel and would have no hesitation to stay again on my next visit to Barcelona",5,2018,03,17
23,Hotel Ohla Review,"It was great! Everyone was so nice, they provided a ton of useful amenities and everything was very clean. The view was very cool and so was the pool. I definitely enjoyed my stay! The breakfast buffet provided awesome food. ",5,2018,03,11
23,Great hotel in an excellent location,"We have just returned home from a long weekend at this hotel. It is a modern boutique style hotel that has managed to retain some character. The rooms were immaculate and very pleasant. Our room looked on to the street and was a little noisy but it did not impact on our sleep or enjoyment of the room.
The breakfast was varied and more than adequate. The bar was an oasis of peace and the drinks list was extensive.
The staff at this hotel were lovely. They were all very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.
The location is excellent. Very close to many of the wonderful attractions that Barcelona has to offer.
We would certainly stay here again.",5,2018,03,08
23,Long Weekend in Barcelona,"The hotel was beautiful and most of the staff were incredible. However, after an administrative error on their receptions part, I found nearly every member of the reception 'team' to be adversarial and aggressive. They had made a mistake and they then took it out on us, as if we were the guilty party for 'spending too much at the hotel!'.... It nearly spoiled a lovely weekend. The concierge staff and the staff at Caelis and Vistro were all absolutely lovely. They also had to be reminded twice to clean the room, but they did leave a bottle of Cava as an apology, so that was a nice gesture.",3,2018,03,06
23,A fabulous hotel with a fantastic rooftop terrace and pool!,"Recently returned from a birthday break in the Ohla hotel. The hotel was stylish and our room was perfect with a central glass shower! The rooftop terrace and pool was lovely with stunning views of the city and warm enough to sit out in the afternoons despite being February. There was a good choice for breakfast and the wine bar was perfect for a late night tipple. For a celebration, the Caelis restaurant was outstanding, an experience I will not forget in a hurry as we sat where we could see the chefs working and preparing our food. The staff were all very welcoming, professional and attentive, but special thanks must go to the charming concierge Albert who could not do enough for us, helping us among other things  with travel arrangements and organising a Flamenco show. I can't wait to go back!",5,2018,02,27
23,A stylish boutique hotel perfectly situated in the heart of Barcelona ,"Genuinely if you want a personable hotel ,excellent location ,bars ,Michelin star restaurant .An excellent wine bar with very helpful expert advice and an even more impressive rooftop bar and pool which has excellent views of the city .The rooms are fantastic too .

Seriously if your bored of staying at large 4/5star hotels you won’t go wrong here in my opinion .Enjoy ! ",5,2018,02,20
23,Fabulous stay at Ohla Barcelona!,"We had such a wonderful and pleasant stay at Ohla Barcelona! Thanks to the thoughtful and professional staffs at the reception and concierge desk! We arrived at an extremely cold and rainy day! I was at the most terrible mood when we arrived at Ohla! However, the lady who checked us in was so friendly and patient! she first calmed me down by offering us a glass of cava, later she was able to upgrade me to the junior suite upon my request since we are Expedia silver/ gold members ! 
The location of the hotel is soooooo perfect that it's close by all the popular tourist spots.....  like the Palau de Catalonia is only across the streets, Les Ramblas is walking distance about 10 mins away! (I found most of the locals we spoke to do not recommend restaurants at Los Ramblas, except those inside the Los Boqueria market, which is very good based on my own experience! ), it's very convenient to walk around yet I like the fact that we're not right on the touristy central! 
The concierge desk has been so helpful during the four days of our stay! We tried Caelis which is the Michelin one star restaurant at the hotel and also another Tapas restaurant they recommended at El Born which is also walking distance! 
Buffet breakfast is okay, selection is acceptable but I don't think it's 5 stars standard tho!!! if you want omelette or fresh poached or fried eggs, you've to pay $5 euro extra! 

PS, there's Juliette balcony in our room but the doors are locked!",5,2018,02,19
23,The most beautiful hotel with stunning views,"This hotel is remarkable. Just got back from the wonderful city of Barcelona and the incredible hotel Ohla Barcelona. Our room was just amazing with the detailed layout and an exceptional bathroom...felt like a Princess. Everything about this hotel was perfect from the greeting at reception, the breakfast dining area and oh my...what a choice, the lovely staff which felt like friends after the 4 days, and nothing was to much for them..they were so helpful, and of course the roof terrace with its superb views. As it was valentines whilst we were there we had a meal in the Caelis Restaurant and I'm still mesmorised how breathtaking the detail of the surroundings was and the clever and talented chefs. Each and every member of the team made us feel very special and attention to detail was beyond expectations. When we come back to Barcelona we will be staying here again definely.",5,2018,02,18
23,Stunning boutique property in the heart of Barcelona,"We absolutely loved our stay here. While the rooms were on the smaller side, the boutique like feel of the hotel, the views, beautiful rooftop and great hospitality were definitely worth staying. It is also very well located and easy access to main attractions!",4,2018,02,16
23,Pity about the gym,"This is a cool hotel with very friendly staff. I have no complaints other than the gym, which was so small and inadequate that they shouldn't have bothered. They should either build a halfway decent gym or give out passes to a local club or just say they don't have one. But to offer this and call it a gym is very deceptive, hence my rating. But everything else was great.",2,2018,02,13
23,2nd time here and would return again,"Lovely boutique hotel near the Gothic quarter of Barcelona. Near many of the main tourist attractions - all within walking distance. Yet once you enter the hotel it feels very calm and quiet. Love their roof terrace, bar man happy to put on heaters, bring blankets and makes a great Gin n Tonic. Concierge staff very nice and helpful. Good selection of buffet breakfast.",5,2018,02,13
23,Gorgeous architecture and unique room,"Hotel Ohla is in the perfect location where you can walk to everything.  Las Ramblas is just far enough so it’s in a quiet setting.  You can see all of the Guadi architecture, churches, and museums.  Gorgeous rooftop bar with pool you can see through.  Very relaxing and fun trip.  The shower more open so it is more for couples than families and if you’re traveling with friends in the same room ask if there is a private shower or be ready.  Very clean and excellent service.  Wonderful visit.",5,2018,01,26
23,Fantastic hotel in a super location,"From the minute you arrive at the front door, this is a welcoming hotel. The Bell Desk on the ground level are ready to help with anything you might request. You get ushered to the Mezzanine level, where check in takes place and the first thing that happens, you get offered a glass of wine. Great start. Our room was spacious and well equipped and looked directly out from the front of the hotel to the hustle and bustle of the area. That is really the appeal. Walk out the front door and everything is right at the door step to get lost in the laneways of Barcelona, which is the appeal of the area. Restaurants galore, shopping galore, everything is there. It is nice stroll to one of the main shopping streets and La Rambla. The Port is not far away and you can walk to all the sights. The hotel has a gym with a spa which is reasonable. Not overly equipped, but adequate. I would say the breakfast was a disappointment. The kitchen was very slow to replenish the hot selection. The roof top area with the pool is a great spot to check out the views of the city and chill out. All in all, a superb hotel and highly recommended.",5,2018,01,13
23,Barcelona early Jan break,"Amazing location, fantastic service.
We loved the hotel Ohla, roof terrace was beautiful, concierge service gave brilliant advice. Cycling to explore Barcelona was very special and highly recommended.
Festival of the Kings was a spectacular Barcelona experience.",5,2018,01,12
23,Wonderful Stay at Ohla for the NYE Holiday,"We booked a junior suite for 3 nights during the NYE holiday. Our room was ready when we arrived early Saturday morning which was a wonderful surprise. Check in was smooth and the concierge was a huge help our entire (very short) stay. Breakfast was pretty good for a hotel breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised. Our room was clean and comfortable. The location was excellent both for walking to historic neighborhoods and for hopping on the subway. We didn't have a chance to use room service or the rooftop pool/bar. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Barcelona! One note - we stayed in a suite on the first floor, just off the landing. On NYE there was a DJ in the lobby which wasn't great for us because his speakers basically fed right into our room. Also, being on the first floor meant we could hear people on the sidewalk and feel the subway running underneath us. We're not light sleepers and street noise doesn't bother so I didn't ask to switch rooms, but this is something to keep in mind if you're assigned a first floor room at checkin.",5,2018,01,09
23,Great New Year!!,"We spent five nights at the Ohla Barcelona over the new year period in one of their junior suites, GREAT ROOM!! This is now one of our favourite hotels. I left my glasss on the flight out and the Concierge staff spent two days trying to get them back.
The service was excellent from all the staff can't wait to go back.",5,2018,01,09
23,Charming Boutique hotel,"This hotel is most probably one of the best hotel in barcelona. As a flight attendant I have the chance to see a lot of hotel. Rooms are clean, the personal is kind and helpful. And the situation is excellent, walking distance from el born and barceloneza! ",5,2018,01,06
23,Great Service especially when things don’t work out ,"We stayed after celebrating New Years with friends in Barcelona. The price tag is not little, so we came with expectations for the junior suite we had booked. The room was beautiful and well designed, the vibe of the hotel was great too, however to be blunt, the stay wasn’t perfect but the staff’s reaction to it was. These were by no means big issues, but going in with high expectations, a non working elevator, a malfunctioning in room phone for room service and an inattentive staff + limited food selection at breakfast, marked the experience. 
However if we are honest things can go wrong and rather than unrealistically assuming a perfect stay it is all about how the hotel handled these situations. The staff (especially the concierge and reception) remained attentive, kept their problem solving attitude and made this hotel first class. We would definitely come back and stay at the Ohla again a little longer in beautiful Barcelona.",5,2018,01,03
23,Divine!!,"Ohla Barcelona was fantastic - great staff, great service, good wifi, artwork, room design, food, rooftop bar - all fantastic.  We LOVE this hotel and will be back.  Thank you so much for looking after us and making our 1st visit to Spain such a great one.",5,2017,12,29
23,Say Si to Ohla!,"I can't say enough great things about this hotel! The staff was friendly and helpful.  They had me the minute I checked in and they offered me a glass of cava.  After a long trip, it was a wonderful surprise to not only get a room upgrade but to find another bottle of cava waiting for me in the room!  The room was stylish and very comfortable.  If the weather had been warmer, I know I would have been up at the roof bar hanging out.  The location is great and there's much within walking distance or a short ride away.  Thank you Ohla for making my first ( and hopefully not last) trip to Barcelona amazing!",5,2017,12,10
23,The Hotel to eat well in the centre!,"We are often going to la Plassohla and Vistro and we are often very pleased.
The menu of the day formula at Plassohla is good, could be more flexible for non dessert eaters )))
We are even more happy now they've implemented a descent snack/food menu at Vistro 49. You'll see us often.
Great place, good hotel, good service. We'd like to feel a little more welcome on the rooftop terrace as non-resident.",5,2017,11,30
23,Best Barcelona experience,"We were blown away by Ohla Barcelona’s exceptional hospitality, great ambiance and excellent food. We would stay here again. It is very centrally located and at a walking distance to the Mercado de La Boqueria, La Rambla and the Plaça Catalunya. 
",5,2017,11,23
23,one word ...Amazing,"From the time you pass through the front door , the amazing staff make you feel
welcome and give you that feel good vibe that you made the right choice in your booking. The location is ideal and you can get to your desired locations very easily. The rooms are immaculate and are cleaned daily, and i have to say i loved the little chocolates on my pillow every night. The hotel restaurants are out of this world and the breakfast buffet is everything you would expect and more, when i get to Barcelona again, OHLA Barcelona is the only place i will stay for my vacation or business trip.",5,2017,11,08
23,Weekend in Barcelona,"We traveled from London on the Eurostar to Lyon and then on to Barcelona in one day and weren't too sure what to expect when we arrived. The Ohla Boutique Hotel is consistent with the feeling of being in the Gothic Quarter as the lighting and decoration is fairly dark and subdued but by no means unpleasant. We checked in and went to our room and the first thing that you see is a glass shower cubicle bang in the middle of the room. To some, this may be a little off putting, but given a chance we soon got used to this strange but interesting feature. A talking point without a doubt. Our room was spotlessly clean and I can only imagine the work that it must take the staff to clean the shower cubicle each day. The Tapas restaurant in the Hotel is a must and I understand it already has a very good reputation. We were looked after splendidly. Overall, a very pleasant stay.",4,2017,11,07
23,Ideal location,"Being located adjacent to an underground station and within easy 5 minute walk of Rambla and Place de Catalunya, this was an ideal Base for our four day break at the end of October. From the friendly staff, the curious display of faces in the reception area and the shower in a glass cabinet in the middle of the room, this was certainly a unique and unforgettable hotel. Buffet breakfast was satisfying and an ideal start to the day. Highly recommended.",5,2017,11,03
23,Amazing hotel,"From the moment you walk in you are meet by calm.  The staff are highly trained and discreet.  
Ohla is in the heart of the city so everything is close.   Breakfast is varied and very fresh.  
The restaurant serves beautiful tapas 

You can relax on the roof terrace and soak up the atmosphere of this beautiful city

Could not recommend this hotel highly enough   ",5,2017,10,31
23,Amazing view from the rooftop,"This was an amazing hotel with an amazing rooftop view. 

The staff were efficient, friendly and discrete allowing the guests to enjoy the stay while still feeling that they were being looked after.

The rooms with glass walled showers are a different touch although if you weren't travelling with a significant other I can imagine this could get a wee bit awkward. Other than this the room was clean, tidy and well proportioned.

In short this is a lovely hotel with a view to the beach, harbour and surrounding countryside",5,2017,10,24
23,Great Location. Friendly Staff. 5 Star,"Our room had one of the 'goldfish bowl' showers mentioned elsewhere in reviews - an interesting twist and quite 'contemporary'.
The room was comfortable, clean and modern, and had a good view over the main road.
Staff were very helpful and friendly. The concierge team were extremely helpful with advice and with booking tickets for attractions.The restaurant staff were attentive without being intrusive. 
Breakfast was good and plentiful - a great way to start the day.
Location was superb - 10 minutes walk from Place de la Catalunya and La Rambla. 30 minutes walk from the harbour. 
We recommend the bus tours if you want to get a sense of the city - good value and interesting commentary.
Highlights were the Gaudi buildings - Sagrada Família and La Pedrara. You should really book for Sagrada Familia at least a day before to make sure that you don't have hours to wait.
Another treat was the boat trip along the coast from the harbour.
Hotel Ohla was a great base from which to explore this great city - thanks to everyone who helped to make our stay so enjoyable and restful",5,2017,10,23
23,Fantastic Hotel!,"I loved staying here. The hotel was modern, chic and very clean.

All the staff are genuinely lovely people who are always ready to help. Ohla Hotel surprisingly makes you feel ""at home"" and very comfortable with where you are. 

The rooms are spotless and include an iPod speaker dock although they are old generation ports so I think these should be updated. The lighting in the room was a little confusing to understand at first, I eventually realized that they were dimmable lights but the switches look like regular ones so you have to hold your finger down on one side of the switch to dim the lights. Also, the showers are see-through so perhaps not for the prude! The amenities were the basics, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste and some q-tips. 

The hotel has a rooftop terrace with a beautiful pool. Drinks and food both available up there and they were nice but a bit on the expensive side. Members of the public are able to come up to the terrace and there were a few occasions where they would smoke cannabis, but nobody seemed to mind.

The hotel has a gym on the first floor which was a little hard to locate at first as the door looks like just another room. The gym was very small but the sauna was lovely. 

Also, every time you use the elevator, you have to use your hotel card but the elevators are also really confusing so I would ask a member of staff to explain how they work. If you press down, they seem to go up. Confusing!

Breakfast was a nice selection, the food inside the hotel is nice. Drinks are great, staff are lovely. The location is perfect. 

Would definitely return here :)

Thanks!",5,2017,10,18
23,How a hotel should be,"I came here on a family trip to celbrate a birthday and from start to finish i couldnt of asked for me. 

On arrival, we sat down to get the rooms sorted out and were met with sweets and a glass of bubbles....great start.

Got the bags in the room and had a look around and it was a lovely atmosphere. The rooms were spacious, had exactly what you needed and the a/c worked a treat!

Breakfast in the morning was great, from cooked to cold food it had something for everyone. 

The staff were always friendly. While waiting in the reception to meet people, they would often come up and have a chat with you and asked if you needed anything. 

I will definitely be visiting again!",5,2017,10,18
23,Fantastic Birthday Trip,"My wife took me to Barcelona for 5 nights in September for my birthday. 

The hotel is wonderfully situated in the Gothic Quarter and so is handy for many attractions. Our room was large and bright and the bed very comfortable. We had a small issue with the plumbing which was sorted very quickly.

The staff on the door were really tremendous. So helpful and knowledgeable. 

Breakfast was lovely though I felt they were short staffed and we had to actively approach the already busy lady for cutlery, tea, ordering an omelette etc. Also it would be nice to have the breakfast setup explained. 

The pool was lovely. Drinks were pricey and on one occasion our bar snack order was given to someone else! No big deal.

My main gripe is peculiar to me and isn't the first time I've encountered this in a hotel but annoying nonetheless - as a Coeliac I have to avoid gluten and was delighted to be told on arrival that there was gluten-free beer. Unfortunately the bar staff at the pool told me I was wrong (after 20 mins of waiting I went to find him) - there wasn't. I offered to go and check myself 8 floors down but figured it is a 5* Hotel so they must know. Thing is my wife checked this in advance of booking and GF beer availability was one of the reasons for booking Hotel Ohla. (My 40th birthday after all).

Anyway it wasn't until the final night that we went for a glass of wine that the Sommelier checked for me...lo and behold, there it was! I was pretty annoyed that the bar staff in a 5* don't even know what they sell. Anyway it was a minor thing, though annoying, especially for a 5*. 

In summary I recommend Hotel Ohla for a special occasion in Barcelona. ",4,2017,10,17
23,Absolutely wonderful!,"We stayed for 6 nights at the end of September whilst the Merce Barcelona celebrations took place over a long weekend. We were in a group of 4 and had 2 junior suites for the stay.
From our check in with Jennifer whilst sipping a welcome glass of Cava until we left we could not fault anything at all about Hotel Ohla.
ALL staff were wonderful......helpful, fun and friendly and showed some personality which is very refreshing and welcome when on a long trip abroad. You could tell they were happy and proud to be there. 
It is definitely a 5 star hotel but also felt like home from home. Breakfast was great, great rooftop bar and pool, rooms spacious & lovely, immaculately clean .
In a terrific location amongst great restaurants & tapas bars, leafy squares to sit and while the hours away. Close to great shopping and public transport.
Will definitely be back on our next trip to Barcelona... faultless!",5,2017,10,16
23,Happy to come back,"This was a family (6) trip to celebrate a special birthday and for a number of reasons was a trip to remember. We arrived during a rally against independence which, we discovered later, was supported by 350,000 people who marched right past the hotel entrance - this made getting from the airport to the hotel quite a challenge however the driver, arranged by the hotel, did a great job and managed to get us only a short walk away. Arriving early and deciding to remain in the hotel, the staff there were more than helpful making a great start to our stay.
From day 2 onwards our trip to the city was one of the best with the rooms being very comfortable although the pillows could have been better but always clean and made up early every day.
The roof top terrace and bar offer fantastic views of the city's landmarks and given some good weather are a pleasant place to while away the hours by the pool.
Breakfast offers a varied selection on a self service basis with attendent and helpful staff.
Finally a word for the concierge staff who could not have been more efficient and helpful offering advice on a range of subjects from the city tours to excellent restaurants.
This is one place all of our party would be happy to come back to",4,2017,10,15
23,A Fabulous 5 Star Boutique Hotel,"Me and my wife spent 4 nights, 9th to 13th October 2017 at this fabulous hotel.

All I can say is this hotel lives up to its 5 star rating; found everything as advertised.

The location is also absolutely spot on with everything within walking distance I.e. restaurants, museums, cathedral, markets, beach and so much more.

Loved the hotel and loved Barcelona

",5,2017,10,15
23,Honeymoon,"We stayed at the Ohla in a deluxe design room for our honeymoon. We could not fault the hotel at all. From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was excellent and the terrace bar was just perfect. The atmosphere of the hotel was relaxing and the cleanliness was second to none. They added a number of unique special touches such as welcome / departure letters, chocolates and the next days weather forecast left on our pillows each night. We were made to feel very welcome and will definitely return in the future when we go back to Barcelona.",5,2017,10,15
23,Mr. Peter Bell,"My wife and I visited this hotel 4-5th October with friends and found it well situated and very accomodating, the junior suite, whilst a little more expensive, well worth it to have the space after travelling for a month. The pool deck whilst smallish has great views and very relaxing. They were very close to the demonstrations but handled the situation professionally and at no time were we concerned, great experience.",5,2017,10,06
23,So relaxing!,"We stayed at the Ohla a few nights ago during the demonstrations being held in the city. We were only guests for one night and had a flight out the next day. Since the demonstrations were happening right in front of the hotel, we were informed by the staff that getting a taxi, using public transport, or ordering a car would not be possible. They were extremely concerned about how we would get to the airport and advised us to leave very early and kept us informed. One of the staff members even offered to DRIVE us to the airport after her shift if we couldn't find transportation. To me that is just above and beyond. We didn't end up needing her help but the gesture was simply the sweetest.

We stayed in a junior suite on the 5th floor which was gorgeous and incredibly quiet. I slept like a baby in that bed. So comfortable! Breakfast was delicious. We also visited the rooftop bar and enjoyed the ambiance as well as our drinks.

Would absolutely stay again and recommend it to others!",5,2017,10,04
23,"In the
Middle of the Gotic, which is near a lot.","Beautiful and well run, ohla is a smart place to stay. Lots of waking areas nearby. Good food and English speaking. We got everything you need in a hotel, including a good bed and great breakfast, while traveling. Good size room and any help you might need.",4,2017,10,02
23,Can't fault anything - well earned 5 star,"We recently had four nights at Hotel Ohla and as seasoned travellers there are not many hotels I can say consistently ticked every box - Hotel Ohla was an exception.

The hotel is located in the heart of most of the tourist attractions in addition to being conveniently located near transport points including the metro, bus, taxi and the tourist buses. Most attractions were within a 30 min walking radius. The hotel has two award winning restaurants - the La Plassohla (an upmarket tapas bar) and Caelis, a Michelin Star restaurant (both we strongly recommend) and a bar/pool on the roof. 

On arrival the two concierge staff were nothing but attentive, friendly and professional. We regularly used their knowledge to gain restaurant recommendations, sight seeing suggestions and to arrange bookings at restaurants and various tourism locations - they were always knowledgeable and extremely helpful. As we learnt later we had mentioned we were there to celebrate my birthday when booking into the Caelis restaurant - they had notified the restaurant and we had a couple of nice surprises (see separate review). 

The ladies on reception were likewise lovely, chatty, friendly and professional. Language was never an issue and like their concierge colleagues the ladies genuinely made us feel welcomed with as Cava and general chat. 

The room was well appointed. The shower in the middle of the room was a bit unusual but it worked well. The room was well appointed and well set out. The cleaners were always thorough and there were nice touches such as a bottle of Cava and note from the Hotel GM found one evening in my room on my birthday in addition to the different evening treats with the bed turned down and the nice touch of the weather forecast for the next day. 

We felt the hotel was reasonably priced in the 5 star bracket and the service we received and the overall state of the hotel were reflected in the rating. 

Only comment we could make is some movie options in English would have been good.

If we ever get back to Barcelona this would be the hotel we would definitely head back to. Strongly recommended.",5,2017,10,02
23,Great choice for a 30th wedding anniversary celebration.,"Day two at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona. 
Just came back for a tiring day of touring the city on the open top bus to find a lovely bottle of cava from the manager to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. A very classy touch for sure.
Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. Super comfy bed and so clean. 
Looking forward to dinner at Caelis tonight. 
If you're searching for a five star hotel in Barcelona- this is the place.",5,2017,09,30
23,Fantastic Hotel,"This was our second visit to this beautiful city hotel. The rooms spotless and have soft bath sheets, amazing shower products and the room perfect.  The rooftop bar has amazing views over the city and Barcelona Cathedral. We found the cocktails lovely although a little pricy, so we opted for alternative drinks. The staff in the bar are helpful and friendly.  The reception concierge staff are brilliant.  Really helpful and knowledgeable and we were always greeted with a welcoming smile and acknowledgement.  Breakfast buffet is good although not as good as a couple of years ago.  You need to ask,  if you want an omelette or latte or cappuccino. These were not automatically offered during our first couple of days until we mentioned it to the hotel. Also when we had finished our cereal our plates were not cleared, so gradually stacked during our breakfast.  It was noticeable to us, as this had all been done a couple of years ago. After a couple of days there was an extra member of staff in the dining room who went above and beyond with her service and was friendly and helpful. However this hotel really is a fantastic place to stay. Without a doubt we shall stay here again when we next return to Barcelona.",5,2017,09,29
23,Beautiful hotel,"We enjoyed our two night stay here. The rooms were really well-appointed, with hi-tech features, great lighting, stylish furnishings and a large bathroom. The hotel has a lovely roof terrace, with a small pool and a bar, which was a superb location to receive friends for a drink and to take in the views before heading out to dinner. Service was overall of a very high standard, except in the breakfast buffet where the staff were grumpy and unfriendly - I would recommend having breakfast in a nearby cafe instead, as the food selection wasn't great - at a hotel of this quality, there should be proper jamon iberico on the buffet selection. I would recommend this hotel and would be happy to return.",5,2017,09,28
23,Excellent ,"Very good hotel situated in the heart of old Barcelona, its the place to be as you are surrounded by just about everything or if not it's easy to get to. Food great, service excellent and concierge very friendly and helpful.",4,2017,09,27
23,Wonderful Hotel,This is a great hotel. The rooms were well furnished and maintained. The staff was helpful and very friendly. Breakfast buffet was very good. The rooftop terrace has a spectacular view of the city along with a friendly bar.,5,2017,09,26
23,Honeymoon Hotel,"We booked this hotel for the last night of our honeymoon as we were traveling through Barcelona back home. We booked it based on the amazing reviews and the rooftop pool which we were looking forward to relaxing at on our last afternoon. When we arrived to the hotel it turned out that the rooftop was closed all afternoon for a private event, we were so upset that we weren't going to be able to enjoy it. The staff was so understanding and kind and immediately rebooked us at their sister hotel (only 10 minutes away by cab) which has a rooftop pool as well. Less than an hour after originally arriving to Ohla Barcelona we were checked in to our new hotel and sitting by their pool with cocktails. Ohla Barcelona even paid for our taxi to the new location. Although we did not stay here they staff went above and beyond to make sure we had an excellent stay in Barcelona, and we cannot way to come back and get to stay with them for real!",5,2017,09,25
23,Fantastic,"This hotel is centrally located with the airport bus a short 5 minute walk away and the hop on/off buses located in the same area.
The breakfasts were fantastic along with the extremely helpful staff. 
Beautiful decor, the shower in the middle of the room may not suit everyone's taste but it was different.
The rooftop pool is not big enough to swim in but perfect for cooling off in or relaxing beside it.",5,2017,09,25
23,Amazing Hotel,"The hotel is really nice, modern and clean! The staff are friendly and willing to help with anything you may need.

The rooms are modern and clean! Bed is super comfortable!

The hotel is in a great location...shops, bars and restaurants all nearby. The hotel is in a good location to attractions.",5,2017,09,22
23,"No shower privacy, totally open to the room!","So, this is so cool if you're staying with a sexy gal but if it's family, kids, parents, or your cold war wife, then I'd personally say no.  That's a design feature I just don't like.  I just don't flop around naked in front of most people, so maybe I'm the weird guy.  

But the hotel is ideally located, nice staff, not Four Seasons nice, but at half the price, they do a REALLY great job.  

Daniel, the concierge, is one of THE BEST!  

The General Manager was so warm-hearted.  A really great man.  

The breakfast is pretty tasty and the breakfast hostess is a great person, witty, funny, and her English is better than my own!  :-)",4,2017,09,20
23,Excellent stay in Barcelona,"Choosing a hotel in this city can be hard as there are so many.  I generally gravitate to smaller boutique hotels and the Ohla fits the bill perfectly but also has an excitement that many smaller hotels do not.  The design is beautiful and the welcoming atmosphere and gracious staff were wonderful.  As others have said, it is very well located and the rooftop lounge and pool and really nice after a day of touring.  The bed was really comfortable too!",5,2017,09,16
23,Perfection!,"We absolutely loved this hotel. It's centrally located, stylish and comfortable. It was easy to forget how central it is as the room was so peaceful.
Every single member of staff we encountered could not have been nicer. The real gem is the roof top terrace and bar. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",5,2017,09,14
23,Great location and air conditioning,"Lovely smallish hotel with no grand public area's which I think most of us never use anyway. Rooms are clean and modern with really great air conditioning which is very important as Barcelona can be brutally hot and humid. The Spanish style breakfast buffet is delicious with made to order coffee and a daily selection of juiced fruit and vegetable drinks. A small rooftop swimming pool transforms into a cocktail (quite expensive) bar with a view in the evening. The Ohla has an enviable location. 5 minutes walk from La Rambla and an extensive shopping area. 2 minutes from Palau de la Musica Catalana. I highly recommended going to see a performance here and no need to pay for expensive seats the venue is not large. Best of all the Urquinaona Metro stop is steps away. Save your legs and use the Metro which is very easy to do and at 9€ for a 10 ride card cheap too. Small tip....remember which entrance you entered the Metro by, it saves a lot of time on the way back. The Metro card is transferable to the extensive bus system. You can catch a bus to the seafront area right in front of the  Ohla. Although many have said before me the hotel staff are exceptional, friendly, efficient and helpful.
I would definitely stay in the Ohla again.",5,2017,09,11
23,GREAT DOWNTOWN HOTEL,"From the moment of arrival this was an excellent experience. Helpful staff (nothing too much trouble), lovely room and the restaurant is absolutely fabulous. Very central too and easy to walk to the Museums, cathedral or take a a cab to the seafront. Good fitness suite and lovely rooftop terrace bar and plunge pool with a view across the city.",5,2017,09,10
23,Classic building totally modernised inside.,"This hotel is different. Gorgeous old historical building, with the inside totally refurbished into a modern, funky, functional and most enjoyable place to use for a week whhile discovering Barcelona. The staff couldn't be more helpful. Breakfast has excellent choices, the everyday restaurant on the ground floor is very good, with food ranging from Tapas to Spanish to International, and the Michelin restaurant at the top of the building is expensive but worth it.  There is an interesting swimming pool on the roof, with great views of Barcelona. Location is central, walking distance to so many places. Well worth trying. We enjoyed our stay there.",5,2017,09,08
23,Perfect accommodation in a recently renovated elegant building,"Ohla is located very  centrally and is a gem. First class dining opportunities including a Michelin rated restaurant. The breakfast is wonderful. We found all staff to be very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Rooms are brilliantly designed, all fixtures and fittings are modern and first class.",5,2017,09,08
23,Ideally located in the heat of Barcelona ,"The staff are friendly and welcoming. The location is perfect, the rooms are very clean and comfortable but a little small. However, the pool bar on the roof top is exceptional for this busy city and makes this an ideal choice. ",4,2017,09,06
23,Excellent accomodations and good location near the port.,"The accommodations and amenities were everything one could expect.  the breakfast and service therein were excellent.

Nice, convenient location, especially close to the port -- for cruisers like us.  We have been in Spain for a week and our Spanish Travel agency booked this hotel (5 star) since our first choice (from a previous visit) was booked - good choice.

The concierge booked us reservations at the Sagrada Familia Cathedral and made a dinner reservation.  He was very helpful and spoke fluent English -- what a treat.",5,2017,09,02
23,Great but can still do better,"Ohla is stunning with their quirky beautiful interiors. The hotel will wow you when you walk in. Stuff is really great and can't do enough for you. The aquarium-like swimming pool upstairs is the cherry on top. They also agreed for a late check out when my boyfriend was feeling poorly and organised a taxi. Very nice of them - and thank you for understanding!

However, Ohla could also do better at the following:
*Breakfast (which was really a 3* or 2.5* breakfast - needs more English speaking staff, speedier toasters which take forever, more food options, more staff availability for personal orders (their ready scrambled eggs tasted awful, and we struggled to find someone for our egg order as staff were too busy or seemed to avoiding us).
* we did not get room toiletries replaced upon their usage - it's the first time that I stayed in a 5* and didn't get a shampoo when I used mine up. Having your guests ask for stuff is just really not a 5* service.
* prices - New York's hotels 5* prices whilst it still feels they are working things out ... plus it's really not New York!",4,2017,09,01
23,I feel home,"Each time I go in Barcelona Ohla it's my favorite hotel. Has everything quiet, central, perfect architecture and designed room. Even lights are perfects. The breakfast it's amazing! 
Perfect for Adult and people used to live in beauty.",5,2017,08,29
23,Wonderful Experience!,"We just got back from Barcelona and stayed at Hotel Ohla. I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel. First of all, it is centrally located to everything so that you can walk literally everywhere. From the time we walked into the gorgeous lobby, I was in love with the whole vibe of the hotel. The concierge staff were amazing. We booked a suite and it was very well furnished. The bed was very comfortable, the mini bar was very well stocked, and the overall amenities were just great. We ate at the restaurant for lunch and it was very good. We had tapas and wine at the Vistro. The girl there gave us excellent service and was very friendly. Every night after wondering the city, we returned to the roof top bar and had wine and or drinks. They staff up there were very friendly and wonderful. It was our first visit to Ohla, but it definitely won't be the last.",5,2017,08,25
23,Wonderful ,"Despite some negative comments that we have seen in TripAdvisor, the Hotel is wonderful in its class of Boutique Hotel, their service is wonderful, it is very well located. 
It has 3 restaurants:  one has a one star Mechelin, another is the tapas bar called Passohla and the third is a wonderful wine bar. 
Their bar at the terrace is also wonderful. The room was wonderful.
Highly recommended! Congratulations to the staff!",4,2017,08,25
23,What a great experience!!!,"Great staff from the restaurant, room service, attached wine bar. The concierge was amazing and helpful for every request. The roof top pool and bar have great views and atmosphere. Right in the middle of everything. ",5,2017,08,18
23,Barcelona Boutique excellent choice!!!,"Ohla is in a fantastic location, central to just about everything. The rooftop pool and bar, delightful for an afternoon siesta or evening cocktail. The staff, friendly, helpful, charming. The rooms are a bit dark but roomy enough. I recommend and would definitely stay again!",4,2017,08,16
23,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel. Great service. No complaints. Brilliantly situated in the heart of Barcelona. Jump on the a2 aerobus from outside terminal 2 if arriving by air. Around €11 for a return bus ticket. Get off at the last stop and it's approx 5 mins walk. Lovely rooftop view. ,5,2017,08,14
23,The worst concierge experience,"I love staying at a 5 star hotel and I love using concierge services. I think it usually beats searching the internet with tons of bias posts of which restaurant is better! However I was not able to enjoy my stay in Barcelona because Dani at the concierge was absolutely awful. We stayed for two days. The first day we asked for a lunch recommendations he was nice and directed us to a good restaurant that we actually liked a lot! After that we asked for dinner recommendations he asked for some time to look what was available and he would let us know what was good. He never actually contacted us. When we contacted the concierge again at night, he was not there and someone else was in charge and had no idea he was supposed to book us a place. The following day we gave up on his suggestions and found a place of our own. We simply asked him to make a reservation and he told us he would and again never reached back. At 8:15 we called the concierge and he rudely told me the restaurant didn't answer their phone and he called all day. Even if that was true he could have let us know so we made other plans on our last night. He said he'd call again and check. 5 minutes later he calls up saying they had one table left for 8:30. It was 8:15. My parter rushed to get ready. At 8:30 we were leaving the hotel trying to get a taxi. 10 minutes went by and we had no luck. I went to the concierge to ask for help calling a car as this hotel does not have any bell man at the door. He just screamed at me ""NO, NO, NO TAXIS"" he actually screamed at me. Up until then I had given him no attitude and my partner was angry at me for not telling him how awful his service was. I told him then he should have told us earlier about the restaurant so we had more time and we wouldn't be rushed. He then screamed at me even more saying he had tried all day and it wasn't his fault. IT WAS HIS FAULT HE DIDNT CONTACT US TO TELL US THAT. Realizing we would have to walk my partner went up to change off her heels she saw him scream at other customers for the lack of cabs. Who in their right mind screams at paying customers especially after his hideous incompetence. This man is not fit to work with guest relations as he is explosive and has no manners. Other than that the hotel was ok. The rooftop is very pretty but the pool and area are way smaller than they appear in pictures. The hotel rooms are also very small and dark. The breakfast food is terrible. My partner wanted to throw up after one bite of the scrambled eggs. I tried it and couldn't swallow either. The rooftop is really the only thing going for it. Such a shame they let their employees treat their guests in such a fowl way.",1,2017,08,13
23,Loved everything about this hotel,"I visited this hotel in June for a long weekend with nine other girls to celebrate my 40th birthday. I can not recommend this hotel enough. Upon arrival we were all greeted with a glass of cava which they kept topping up. Check in was very quick and efficient. Our rooms were lovely, modern & very stylish, although it took a little getting used to having zero privacy when showering due to  the glass shower backing directly onto the bedroom haha!! Shy I am not but no one needs to unnecessarily see all of my bits. 
When we entered our rooms there was a bottle of chilled cava waiting for us which was a lovely touch. 
The pool is situated on the roof and the view is stunning. The roof terrace/pool area is rather small but even though there were 10 of us we always found somewhere to sit etc. The pool food was quite steep so I would probably recommend venturing out of the hotel. 
The location of the hotel is spot on. It's totally central. 
We had B&B & the breakfast every morning was a buffet but was very fresh and tasty. If you wanted a latte you could order for a small charge. 
I would definitely go back, and all 10 of us said the same thing. 
",5,2017,08,13
23,Fantastic Stay,"This was my first time visiting Barcelona and I booked this hotel based on the stellar reviews, locations and amenities (roof top pool in particular)....my expectations were exceeded in all areas! The staff was excellent and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting for the first time. ",5,2017,08,10
23,Hotel with a view and pool,"Lovely hotel with fantastic views from the roof pool area.  Clean and comfortable room.  Restaurant a little expensive, but a good breakfast.  Handy location to The Ramblas and not far from some lovely beaches.  Some shade on the roof would be handy, but understand why they don't want umbrellas.  Perhaps cover the lounge area.",5,2017,08,08
23,Wish I could give it 10 stars instead of the 5 Trip Advisor offers,"We simply ADORED this hotel!  The staff is extremely friendly and ready to help you out with whatever it is that you desire.  The location was perfect -- in the Gothic Quarter -- and OH, that rooftop!  You just can't get enough of the views from up there.  Our room was comfy and spacious, and quite European (we are from US). Loved every minute of our stay here!",5,2017,08,08
23,CATALAN CHARM IN SPADES,"Nestled in Barcelona’s gothic district where one almost expects to bump into Picasso himself, is this incredible gem. You step into this ultra hip space to be warmly greeted and efficiently settled by the warm and professional staff.
Rooms are comfortable and well appointed and also a feast for design freaks. Generous buffet breakfast in a very cool dining area with street view. Loved the whole experience of the HOLA and will definitely be back also because it is impossible not to fall hopelessly in love with Barcelona and the Catalan people.",5,2017,08,08
23,Wonderful," I had a wonderful time here.  Roof top pool and bar was amazing.  The breakfast which was included was great.  Roi. And service second to none.  This will be my first choice when I return to beautiful Barcelona. ",5,2017,08,04
23,Beautiful hotel in convenient location,"The hotel is a boutique hotel, so it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a large hotel. However - the roof top swimming pool is spectacular, the rooms were very modern with a large comfortable bed. Location is close to everything - beach, gothic quarter and shopping.

Customer service was excellent too, but like I said the roof top is the selling point.

We've spent the end of our travel days chilling in the swimming pool - perfect way to end it.

Plasshola tapas bar also had very creative and delicious dishes.",5,2017,08,03
23,The Rooftop is a must!,"We went to eat at Plasshola, the food was terrific. Then  we had a drink at the rooftop bar. The view from there is spectacular and the ambiance and service is great. We found that Luis, the former head bartender of the Delano in Miami now lives in Barcelona and works at this beautiful place. I strongly recommended to anyone that comes to Barcelona. ",5,2017,07,31
23,Nice,"This is definitely a boutique hotel, with very high standards on customer care. From the beginning the reception is different than any hotel you know, the policy in this hotel is give you the best possible personalized attention. The room is big enough for everything you need, and you always will find a little surprise after your room is cleaned. In the summer is a must, a visit to the pool on the roof.",5,2017,07,30
23,Perfect Hotel in Barcelona,"Stayed at the Hotel Ohla for 4 nights July 7th-12th and would definitely stay here again.  Check in was nice and easy, they also gave us some cava (and a refill) while checking in. 
 Room was spacious and clean.  We were on the second floor right over the wine bar, the street Via Laietana was right outside our window and we were not bothered by any street noise.  Nice touch having a free bottle of water for both of us every night.  
Breakfast was nice, pastries, scrambled eggs, delicious cured meats and little sandwiches, you can ask for fried or poached eggs, and cave is included.
Roof top bar and pool is beautiful, great place to grab a cocktail and take in the views of the city. The pool closes at 7pm so no late night swimming.
Our favorite place to grab a drink in Barcelona was at the hotels wine/cocktail bar, Vistro 49,  there were three couples in our group and every night we would meet at the bar before heading out and then end the night there with a nightcap.  Our bartender was amazing, she is studying mixology, so we had fun trying her different creations.
The location was perfect for our stay, easy to walk to the cathedral, Las Ramblas, Placa de Catalunya, and many restaurants, or just ask the concierge and they will call you a cab.
Take advantage of the concierge they pointed us to some of our favorite meals in the city.
Definitely will recommend this hotel and next time in Barcelona will book again.",5,2017,07,28
23,"Beautiful hotel, great location ","We were very pleased to stay in this hotel during our honeymoon. Great location, walking distance to the beach packed with clubs and restaurants, and also to some of the greatest site seeing. The cathedral, etc.
Just a 10 minute cab ride to sagrada familia.
Great wine and espresso bar in the lobby.
Small, but reasonable gym with a sauna.
Quick (but not great) room service.
Free and delicious breakfast was a plus.",5,2017,07,23
23,Our 1st holiday as a new family!,"We stayed here for 5 nights, my husband booked the hotel for my 30th birthday. We had a junior suite, which fitted the 3 of us perfectly. The attention to detail was second to none. The cot was laid out toiletries for both adults and baby. Rooms are so clean and tidy. We actually felt sorry for the room staff when we had to leave in such a rush one morning and left our room in such a state.

Although we weren't welcome to eat in the restaurants in the evening due to have a 9 month old. Breakfast and the roof top bar food was great. The poached eggs were just perfect every morning. Although I would ask that the hotel invest in a decent toaster, these took forever and if you wanted a bit of colour on your bread you needed a good 3/4 attempts to achieve it.

The pool was a lovely addition to our stay, although a bit shocked to find it was salted water rather than chlorinated and maybe other guests needed to be aware of the glass sides (yes you and see everything).

Rooms are a bit noisy due to the busy city road but you expect this with the hotels central location.

The birthday packaging was also a lovely surprise.
We would most certainly come back - you made our 1st family holiday so easy",5,2017,07,23
23,Funky 5* Boutique Hotel - with fantastic rooftop pool & bar,"We visited the Ohla Barcelona for 3 nights (mid July) and enjoyed every minute of our stay.  

The staff were all very friendly and professional and the hotel was perfect.  The hotel and rooms are beautifully designed and have a funky twist to the decor. 

The hotel is in a great location and has an AMAZING rooftop bar and pool which we used for a happy hour drink after sightseeing and also late for a nightcap. 

 LOVE this hotel and would highly recommend.",5,2017,07,22
23,Price and stars do not correspond..,"A hotel situated in the middle of Barcelona.
Fantastic building with fantastic rooms.
The service at the hotel itself is great.
However, be aware the consept of outsourcing...
The roof terrace is not managed by the hotell and we were not so pleased about the treatment.
The same goes for the breakfast.
The eggs/omelette came after 20 minutes and buffet were not looked after and filled up accordingly. 
We are not so sure that we are willing to pay such a high price with so many minus on our next stay.
Then we rather stay at the hotels we have used during our previous visits to Barcelona.",4,2017,07,19
23,Perfect stay,"Right from the beginning we were greeted and made to feel very welcome. The people at the reception did their best to give us an earlier check-in. The hotel is very new therefore everything feels very fresh. We had a junior suite which was very spacious, the toiletries offered were very nice. The breakfast area was great with a large number of options included cooked dishes. 

The hotel has a generous private change room/ showers for guests to use before check-in  or after check-out which is very convenient.

Finally, the bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced.",5,2017,07,19
23,"Beautiful, Modern hotel","We stayed here as the first leg of our honeymoon European tour, and we were not disappointed. The staff were friendly and helpful. When we arrived to the room, we had sparkling wine and chocolates waiting for us. The bed was very large and comfortable and the room had everything we needed. 
The rooftop bar and pool was a beautiful place to sit and have a drink, whilst looking out over Barcelona. its very easy to get around from its location, and we walked to most of the places we wanted to get to.",4,2017,07,19
23,4 Barcelona nights,"After 34 hours in transit we checked in to this lovely boutique hotel in El Gotic in Barcelona. Fantastic 4 days. The staff in all parts of this hotel are truly outstanding. Very friendly, helpful and very efficient. The rooms and facilities are great and the hotel is in a perfect location in Via Laetana. I could not recommend this hotel more highly. Try the rooftop chill out bar and La Plassohla, the tapas restaurant. ",5,2017,07,18
23,Perfect place to stay! ,We stayed there for 5 nights. Rooms are really clean and tidy. Staff very friendly and helfully. My airline lost my suitcase so they were taking care for me aswell. We loved it. Really nice hotel & perfect location! Rooftop bar & pool was very beautiful as well. View is amazing!,5,2017,07,13
23,Love this hotel!,"The Hotel Ohla is a wonderful hotel! Great location, right between the gothic and el born areas. Public transportation right out of the door. Walkable to much of Barcelona. The hotel itself is very nice, clean, helpful staff, contemporary design. We also enjoyed the rooftop bar. I would highly recommend the Ohla! ",5,2017,07,10
23,Great location in central district,"Lovely boutique hotel with excellent overall service. 
Just bear in mind that the shower is in the centre of the room so there is no point being precious about your modesty.. Concierge excellent, breakfast quite adequate and 8th floor bar and pool a bonus.",4,2017,07,09
23,Fantastic hotel,"The hotel was one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Spotlessly clean and lovely, friendly  staff. It has a pool and cocktail bar on the roof. Fantastic. With views around the city. We went there for my daughters 21st birthday. While we were out for the day they left her a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice and a lovely message from the manager. Five stars for this hotel.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2017,07,08
23,STAY HERE! 5 star all around ,I strongly relied on trip advisor to find a hotel in Barcelona so I feel that I should write a review myself. This hotel beat our expectations. It was a clean hotel with great service in a perfect location. We could easily walk everywhere. You must meet Luis on the roof. He was so nice and makes the best mojitos. Quiche in reception was amazing and taught us so much about Barcelona. All around a 5 star hotel in a 5 star location with 5 star prices. ,5,2017,07,04
23,Excellent Location.. Small Rooms,"Though i loved the location of the hotel.. the rooms were a bit small.. The Breakfast was adequate with limited vegetarian options. Initial staff customer service was polite.. however, it turned into indifference when there was a power outage.. specifically from the person at the front desk. To counter that, there were other staff members that were quite polite and forthcoming in assisting to make the stay bit more comfortable.",3,2017,07,04
23,Excellent location,"Very nice hotel in a perfect location,close to shopping and close to transit,great breakfast and all day restaurant, great and friendly service, very close to Las Ramblas and Catalonia Square and El Corte Ingles.",5,2017,06,28
23,Great hotel in a Great Location,"We really liked the Ohla Barcelona. I loved the contemporary design and the cool decor. I was pleasantly surprised when we checked into our Junior Suite Deluxe and found out that even though the description said ""queen"" bed, it was actually a ""king"". When your traveling in Europe the bed sizes always get a little interesting. The hotel was walkable to everything and they had maid service twice a day. The one reviewer complained about the breakfast. I do not know what they were expecting from a European ""free"" breakfast but honestly it was just as good if not better than anywhere we've stayed in Europe. We stay at high end hotels and this hotel was a European 5 stay city hotel. Our room was on par with other European hotels, towels were amazing, it was clean, The roof top pool/bar was beautiful. Definitely would recommend this hotel. Although, I would say, the rooms are more designed for couples....not families.",5,2017,06,26
23,Amazing hotel in great location!!,"First off, location: This hotel was in the perfect location! Since we are pretty value oriented, and didn't want to pay for a ~$30-$40 taxi ride from the airport to our hotel, we opted to take the A1 Aerobus, which was probably even faster than a taxi because it has its own bus lane and barely makes a stop along the way to Plaza Catalunya. It was a short 5 minute walk down a beautiful street to get to the hotel. From there, it was so centrally located and Barcelona is such a walkable city that we were able to get anywhere with little effort. Its proximity to delicious restaurants (Tapas24, churros, etc.) made our trip so much more comfortable not having to figure out so many cabs and logistics.

Hotel and amenities: These were stellar! Breakfast every morning was so delicious - the iberico ham, the eggs, pastries, coffee, etc. were an excellent way to start the day. As you can see from the beautiful photos of the pool and roof too, it was such a treat to have the beautiful views, drinks by the pool, and to relax on the roof.

Room: The room was very good - not the best we've stayed at, but very clean, spacious (especially for Barcelona standards from what I understand), and serviced very well. There is a nice bottle of complimentary water which is restocked everyday by the very nice house keeping staff. Being on the 3rd floor, I feared we would suffer from hearing all the noise outside - luckily, it was very well insulated and that didn't happen!",5,2017,06,20
23,Botique Hotel with amazing views & amazing service!,"The hotel is chic in design.  The staff is amazing. They are incredibly helpfull from the bellman, barman to the concierge.  The views are breathtaking from the rooftop bar. We loved going up for a cocktail everynight before going out.  The rooms are fun, glass shower, seprate potty which if great. The location is perfect in the Gothic Quarter you can walk everywhere!  Wifi is easy to work with. We LOVED it!  Also a great value!",5,2017,06,19
23,Underwhelming - Very Disappointed,"We recently returned from a frustrating 4 night stay at this supposed 5 star hotel. As frequent luxury travelers we're observing more and more that there is true 5 star and then there are imposters posing to be so without delivering. We feel this place fits firmly into the 2nd category.

The major issues we have with Ohla and it's 5 star claim:

1. Horrible breakfast. Probably the worst hotel breakfast I've ever had. The fact that it's served in a supposed Michelin star restaurant is a sad indictment on everyone involved. Very poor food selection, staff more interested in packing up half an hour before closing then offering coffee or a la carte eggs. The scrambled eggs on the buffet were cold and curdled. We ended up going elsewhere for the rest of our stay which I've never had to do before in a ""5 star"" hotel.

2. Room is of a fairly generic contemporary design. Small bathtub. Bed was a bit uncomfortable. The junior suite was quite poky so I'd hate to see what the smaller rooms were like. Nothing luxe about it. 

3. Noise. The corridor is very noisy with cleaning staff and passers by throughout the day from early morning onwards. A lot of people use the stairs as the elevators either don't work or take a long time to arrive and this generates even more noise within rooms. Coupled with the street noise from the busy main road below it was just a bit too much.

4. The pool. Promising pool area ruined by staff that don't fulfil basic orders or take ages (ie 1 hour plus) to do so. Also a real lack of lounges. This is really unfortunate as it's a nice area with a great view and the area could be a great asset for the hotel if it really cared about its guests as opposed to making money from non-guest sources (see below). Also I wanted to take a swim at 7pm on a beautiful evening and was told by the pool staff I couldn't as the pool was closed for chemical maintenance. When I called reception to confirm this I was told that the pool closes at 7pm as the area becomes a bar for outside hotel guests. Absolutely ridiculous and totally and completely unacceptable at a supposedly 5 star establishment. There is nothing in any welcome pack which affirms this so called ""policy"". Paying hotel guests should always come first and particularly not be misled to suit other business purposes. As a pool owner the chemical maintenance line was pretty pathetic.

Overall, many of these issues have been highlighted by other guests in some recent reviews and whilst the hotel says it notes them and will try to improve they don't seem to have been doing anything to actually make it happen. The fact that the damaged street windows from the May Day protest, whilst not the hotel's fault, hadn't been fixed after 5 weeks is also concerning as it's not a nice welcome for guests to walk into a hotel showing such extensive damage. Quite off putting. So my advice if you are looking for a true 5 star experience is to look elsewhere.",2,2017,06,16
23,Cozy rooms!,"Very good hotel. Cozy rooms, the same as the photos.Very clean! Hotel staff is helpful and courteous. Sound insulation isn't perfect, but all sound are muffed. I'm sure to come again! I will be recommending anyone who comes to Barcelona stay at this great hotel!",5,2017,06,14
23,Excellent Service Great Location ,"In the Middle of the Gothic Quarter the location could not be more perfect. Boutique hotel with charm and exceptional service/attention to detail. The concierge was beyond helpful, Pablo offered great advice for dining/bars etc which made our few days in Barcelona amazing. Well worth the price! ",5,2017,06,11
23,3 night stay in Barcelona,"We stayed for 3 nights at this lovely hotel .
Excellent location in the middle of it all .
The breakfast was delicious and we also had some exquisite Tapas one day .
We had an upgraded room which offered great views and lots of space.
Loved the modern bathroom and shower . Great start for the day .
Very cool and hip rooftop terrace with an infinite edge pool .
Great views of the city from the top - which I enjoyed while sipping a cocktail .
I know where to stay when I come back !",5,2017,06,11
23,Great Home Away from Home,"The location of Hotel OhLA Barcelona is in a great location. We were about 15 minute walk to the beach and harbor area. The staff was very nice and always had answers to your questions. Belen was very helpful with check in and we even decided to stay an extra night because we enjoy the service. The concierge desk was excellent on every recommendation we ask for. Dinner place, lunch places, tourist spot were dead on. The roof top pool is also a good addition to end your evening. Please be aware this is Europe so the rooms are small but comfortable!",5,2017,06,10
23,All we could ask for and more!,"We enjoyed 3 nights stay at Hotel Ohla and it was all we could have asked for and more. The staff couldn't have been friendlier. At checkin we were greeted with a glass of Cava and our glasses were refilled! We spent a decent amount of time on the rooftop - enjoying the view in the morning upon arrival, in the evenings for a nightcap and an afternoon for a swim. The rooftop bartender was FABULOUS and remembered our names from the night before. All the guests seemed to love the rooftop pool, both kids and adults! Another great addition to the hotel was the buffet breakfast (included in our rate). Options included eggs, sausage, bacon, pastries, meat and cheese, fruit, yogurt, granola, etc. 

Rooms were nice with turndown service each night. The only thing to consider is if you are traveling with a friend or family the shower is open to the entire room. We heard there are curtains but our room did not have one. 

Another important thing to mention is that the hotel helped us setup a rental car for the day. The car was dropped off right at the hotel and we were able to return it there as well. As soon as we pulled in upon returning from the day, the staff was immediately there to help us and took care of everything!",5,2017,06,06
23,"Good value, great location","We stayed at Ohla Barcelona for one week and really enjoyed the Gothic quarter.  The location was good for sightseeing and close to most attractions, restaurants, bars, and shops.  We had great service, (thumbs up for the delicious breakfasts), and a quiet room despite the bustle outside. The roof bar was outstanding.",5,2017,06,05
23,THE Perfect place,"it is perfect from all aspects, beautiful, great location, incredibly nice and helpful staff. we received an amazing upgrade without even asking. we did not want to leave the room. we had a really wonderful experience!",5,2017,06,04
23,"Excellent rooms and service, great location","We spent nearly a week here and it is terrific. Located no more than 10 minutes from the old cathedral, La Rambla, the Catalina square and the Jewish Quarter one cannot ask for a better spot. The hotel room we had was fantastic.......large, spotless, modern and beautiful linen, bed and bathroom. There is a beautiful bar and pool on the top floor. Services from the concierge desk was terrific....very knowledgeable and friendly. We went out for breakfast each morning to get a walk in....many close places less than Euros 20. The hop-on-off bus service is 10 minutes away, and there are a number of small supermarkets within 2 minutes walk. A little pricey but worth every cent.",5,2017,06,01
23,Not as great at the other branch,"I stayed at this hotel with friends in mid May. We liked the Ohla Eixample so much, we canceled another reservation to stay here. Unfortunately, it wasn't as nice. It may be that the location of this branch is a bit more touristy and busy. But the facility was not as well kept, the staff not quite as helpful, and the overall experience not as good. The room, however, was superb, very large suite with an extra bed and nice tub/dressing area. I suppose it depends on your preferences--if you want something quieter and more personal, the Ohla Eixample is the way to go.",3,2017,05,31
23,Lovely room with excellent service,Spent one night at Ohla. Concierge very helpful. Everyone at front desk quick to respond to any questions or concerns. Breakfast buffet delicious. Greeted with cava and felt very welcomed after a long overnight flight.,5,2017,05,29
23,Check if the rooftop pool closes early ,"We visited hotel ohla in May

First impressions are lasting, our first port of call was the roof top bar, on the afternoon of Saturday the 20 th. I ordered 2 Americano's, they arrived and were delivered by a rather grumpy waiter who slapped them down in front of us. We then asked him for a toasted ham and cheese and you would think we asked him if we could fly to Mars. Really poor service, and would not make you feel welcome. The following day there was a lady serving from the pool bar, we asked her for 2 coffee's and they never arrived. This area of the hotel could generate a lot of income if they had a nice barbecue and staff that were enthusiastic and customer focused.

In contrast our check in experience was excellent, the lady was friendly, efficient and pleasant.

The concierge was excellent they recommended a fantastic restaraunts and
nothing was to much bother, they made a 
very good impression on us.thanks to Danny and Albert.

The room was a little small for a suite but it was very modern and stylish.

Hotel is in a excellent location.

The reason we stayed here was we wanted 
a roof top pool, the pool did not disappoint
but service needs improvement.Also we were very disappointed that when booking we were not told the pool would shut early for a conference, i would advise anyone booking to ask when the pool shuts,because if you are dreaming of a rooftop view of Barcelona you maybe told the pool closes at midday for a conference.

",3,2017,05,28
23,Wonderful Haven,We were in Barcelona to attend a conference. This hotel was excellent. A great breakfast room. An excellent wine/tapas bar and a wonderful roof top pool/bar. Quiet and comfortable rooms. The glass shower in the room was trendy. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very helpful. Highly recommend. ,5,2017,05,27
23,Perfect launchpad for a visit to this city,"Immaculate. Staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. The tapas restaurant is a delight. The Caelis is an experience that absolutely should not be missed. 

Winding down, people watching with a pre-dinner drink served by the charming sommelier in the wine bar after a day exploring Barcelona was a particular highlight.

Not even the taxi strike in the pouring rain could take the shine off our visit.",5,2017,05,27
23,Fantastic location. ,I was very happy with this hotel. The location cannot be beat and the service is excellent. Every employee was willing to help and the concierge was very helpful. I loved Barcelona and I would not be surprised if I return again soon!,5,2017,05,27
23,Away days,"Wonderful from the outside, even better inside. Lovely spacious clean room, friendly staff, super choice of breakfast . On the top floor a beautiful view of Barcelona while you sip a cocktail or have a dip in the pool. Very central, would definitely stay again. Superb.",5,2017,05,25
23,Just perfect !,"This is a not-too-big boutique hotel with nice location near everything, but not in crowded areas of Barcelona. Staff is just great and made us to feel like very special quests. Nice small top roof top pool and bar to relax. Breakfast was super too.",5,2017,05,21
23,Fantastic ,"Superb hotel in the most fantastic of cities. Visited with friend for a long weekend and we were very impressed. Booked Junior suite which was very comfortable. (The only issue we had was that the hairdryer cable was too short...rm 304) 
The staff are highly efficient, friendly and professional. Special mention must be made of Albert the concierge, a super guy who was knowledgable, informative and just lovely.
Highly recommend Caelis, but definitely book before you travel. 
Breakfast was lovely as was the tapas.
The only drawback was the rooftop bar. Whilst having amazing views it lacked any atmosphere at all. I think perhaps the staff were new (i am being kind) as they were slow and non-engaging. Also the sangria was the poorest we tried in Barcelona.
All in all we had a fantastic stay in a beautiful hotel. Will definitely return ",5,2017,05,21
23,A true five star experience.,They receive you in an intimate reception desk on the first floor with a juice or glass of cava to proceed with the check-in. The rest of the stay is a chain of carefully selected luxuries. The restaurants and cocktail bar will match the same expectations. Highly recommended.,5,2017,05,18
23,Hidden gem,"A boutique hotel with a small roof top swimming pool and bar area, which was great fun both during the day and at night. A real gem tucked away in the middle of it all.  Staff were faultless.  Glass of cava on check-in set the scene for the weekend.  Clean and modern.  ",5,2017,05,14
23,Lovely Hotel...shame about bathroom doors!,"Lovely Hotel, staff very friendly and helpful, even if check in before 3pm is a challenge. Beautiful simple breakfast, good size rooms, but lack of bathroom doors can be inappropriate in an allegedly 5 star hotel. If you don't want to be disturbed forget it, cleaners are busy and noisy from 7am onwards. 

Location was brilliant, however, the front of the hotel had been damaged during the May Day protests and not yet repaired. Don't go there if there is a protest planned. 

Rooftop bar is fabulous...but closes at 9pm. What a waste!!  Pool is more of a plunge pool. 

Could be so much better, and I would not agree with its 5 star rating by a long long way. ",3,2017,05,12
23,Wow!,"Booked this for my husbands 60th surprise trip to Barcelona and agonised for weeks which hotel to book not knowing the city. I couldn't have chosen better it was perfect. We chose a deluxe junior suite - the room was fabulous - very spacious - modern - floor to ceiling big Spanish windows. Lovely large bed and luxurious bulgari toiletries.
The check in area is very small and was crowded so they gave us a glass of cava - despatched us very nicely and efficiently to the rooftop pool and bar whilst they
Completed our check in. Staff could not have been more helpful or friendlier throughout our stay.
The hotel sent us a bottle of caca with ice bucket and champagne glasses for my husbands birthday.
The concierges (especially Albert and  pablo) were unbelievably knowledgable and efficient - suggesting and booking restaurants and cocktail bars that you would never know existed and they only sent us to the best - ringing beforehand to advise them we were coming and receiving a free welcome drink. The breakfasts were good apart from they sometimes ran out of a few hot things and it took a long time for chef to replace them but a minor criticism.
The hotel was excellent and I would return again - it actually enhanced our stay!
After a long hot sticky walking day it was lovely to recharge your batteries at the rooftop bar.
The location is superb - right on the fringe of the gothic quarter and 15/20 mins walk from the harbour. 
If only all hotels were as wonderful!",5,2017,05,11
23,"Great location, spacious rooms, friendly staff ","Overall a very good stay.  We had spacious interconnecting rooms. The main shopping and tourist areas are within short walks.  Breakfast was good, although not the amazing choice you get at many 5 star hotels, although this is not top end prices.  Concierge desk was fantastic and nothing was too much trouble - we relied on them for a lot of arrangements and information.  We enjoyed the bar and you can take a reasonably priced bottle of wine up to your room.  Overall a comfortable stay. 
",4,2017,05,07
23,Very nice,"Hotel was very nice and quiet boutique hotel. Reception was located on 0,5 floor and cold cava was offered when checking in. Room was nice, shower w class walls in the middle of the room.
Breakfast not overwhelming w offer but goid enough. 
Situated very close to shopping places and bus stops",5,2017,05,07
23,Beautiful Modern Hotel in the Heart of the Old City,"We stayed at the Ohla from 4/27 to 5/2 in a Junior Suite Deluxe on the 3rd floor, with a nice view out of the front of the hotel. Our friend had a similar room on the 2nd floor. I really wanted to leave a five-star review, however there were little things that bothered us about this hotel. 

The good: 
The rooms were nicely laid out, with spacious bathrooms and rainfall showers, and were very quiet. Despite facing a busy street we could barely hear any traffic noise, and we never once heard any of our neighbors. Everyone we met, from servers to housekeeping, were all very friendly and gracious. They were warm and inviting and seemed to genuinely want us to have a good experience. The rooms came with breakfast, and overall the food was very good. We ate there one evening (La Plassohla) and it was also very good. The bar was packed, but everyone had a great time and the bartenders very fun and sociable. 

The bad:
On our first night, shortly after arriving, we asked the concierge to recommend a good local restaurant, not touristy, with good, local food. He immediately recommended Casa Leopoldo and made reservations for us and we were very appreciative. We got to the restaurant and it was empty, and as it filled up it was all tourists. The food itself was not very good...our paella was brown and tasted as if it were cooked with beef broth. We were puzzled why he recommended this place until a local informed us that the owner or chef of the hotel owned this restaurant as well. This left a sour taste in our mouths. It was by far our most expensive meal of the trip and the least satisfying. 

One other distraction was the lighting. There were light switches everywhere! There was a great nightlight next to the toilet, but it took us 3 days to figure out how to turn it on, but in order to do that it also turned on 4 other lights. The main light was frustrating because if I pressed it nothing would happen. I finally realized that I had to tap it quickly, and holding it activated the dimmer. I felt as though we needed a small manual on how to use the lights, but if we need a manual then it is too complicated. On top of that there were switches that didn't do anything. I am not technically challenged, but I found this very puzzling and frustrating overall.

The ugly:
The spiral staircase. It was beautiful, however the combination of dark stairs and inadequate lighting made it downright dangerous. We simply could not see the steps, and were left tapping our shoes in front of us to see if there was another step. Our friend fell and scraped her shin, and although the management were very sympathetic they explained that they'd complained to the owner but he refused to fix it and alter the design. We also noted others having difficulties and having to use the flashlight apps on their phones to see the steps. This, to me, is a serious design flaw. 

Summary:
Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. It was centrally located, close to great restaurants and shopping, and very clean and visually appealing. However, be prepared to either take the elevator or use the flashlight on your phone for the stairs.",4,2017,05,06
23,Nice - but certainly not 5 star.,"We picked Ohla due to reviews on various websites and for the pictures of that rooftop pool! The view from the rooftop was well worth it - it feels like you can see all of Barcelona from up there! The pool itself is very small (my partner did swim even though it was cold!) and the afternoon sun and cocktail on the roof is beautiful. Our check in was excellent with Belen (she was very helpful).  The room (junior suite) did not have any windows that could be opened, the size of the room was good and the daily clean was amazing (very thorough). Now the location is very central to all the shops and walking to the gothic quarter and the tourist strip if you want that. Sleeping was extremely difficult - there were garbage trucks at 3am and the noise level was significant (and we were on level 5). We asked to move - but were told that we were on the 'quiet side' already and not directly over the road. The breakfast was in no way a 5 star hotel - a 3 star at best. There were no gluten free options, make your own tea, limited options - very disappointing after the 5 star breakfasts we had at other hotels. We would not stay at this hotel again due to the noise and the average breakfast. Location, room size and cleanliness is very high. I would rate it is a 3.5 star hotel, not a 5 stay (look at the Mandarin Hotel - we had a high tea there and would stay there next time or down at the beach).",3,2017,05,06
23,Great Hotel,Ohla Barcelona was a very nice first impression of our stay. The entire hotel staff was very pleasant and attentive. They upgraded our room to a deluxe room and they sent us a bottle of champagne because they knew we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday. The location was perfect as well. We were in a central location to everything. We would definitely stay here again!!,5,2017,05,04
23,Good location - lovely staff,"A stop over after a cruise, we found this an ideal location for visiting Barcelona with most places in walking distance and if needed a very adjacent Metro station.
Excellent welcome by reception staff and explanation of 'their' St George's Day Celebrations. Great rooms and albeit the central of the room shower was a little 'strange' it worked well!",5,2017,05,03
23,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nites....can't say enuf about the room (comfortable in every way),  the breakfast, the staff and the location.  You can walk everywhere from here...Gotic, El Born, Garcia, all things Gaudi. 
FYI: we had a really late arrival into Barcelona and the entire night staff was well aware and greeted us warmly.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,02
23,Easter week,"The Ohla Barcelona is truely unique in every respect. Very deserving of the 5 star rating. Every detail in the room is meticulously taken care of. The management and staff were always attentive to their guests. The rooftop lounge and pool are superb as well, with an attendant to take care of the guests. The indelible positive experience of staying at the Ohla Barcelona for 5 days was a highlight of my trip. I definitely look forward to returning.",5,2017,05,02
23,A rooftop pool bar in the center of Barcelona ,"We arrived at around 10 a.m., from a night long haul flight, so exhausted.  The room was not ready but we were able to take shower and change at the hotel's gym, thanks to a very charming receptionist.

Before going out for a walk and lunch, I went up to the rooftop bar.  Bright sunshine and a cool breeze! And a splendid view over this enchanted old Gothic area! 
Joined by my colleagues, we stayed for apéro, with very delicious tapas!  A bottle of Cava brightened up the mind, to go for a walk and lunch!

カタロニア音楽堂近くのこのホテル屋上にはプールとバーがある。バルセロナの旧市街を見渡す景色が素晴らしい。ソファ席は木かげもあり、昼は明るい太陽と心地よい風を受けて、カバとタパスでいつまでものんびりバカンス気分を味わえる。ここで休めば、どこにも行きたくなるぐらいだが、ゴシック地区散歩に繰り出す元気ももらった！

",5,2017,05,01
23,Top Notch Hotel with Excellent Service/modern Wine Bar,"The best location, quiet, cafes, tapas everywhere, safe, cordial; very professional  staff and the best tapas in their 5 star dining room.  I stayed for 2 weeks in a Deluxe Jr Suite with floor to ceiling windows, black out drapes and the most comfortable bed. Air conditioning is the Best in Europe! You truly feel welcomed and taken care of. Walk out the front door and you are on ""lovely old Gothic streets"".  3 blocks to Las Ramblas, .  Across the street is the El Born area (well worth walking through the ancient streets)  go further and its a short walk to the gorgeous and fun Barcelona Beach. Pool deck with awesome views and food/drink.  The Hotel Ohla is a Jewel in the city.  Truly a 5 star experience.  I loved the place.",5,2017,05,01
23,Great Hotel and Centrally Located,"We loved this hotel for it's great location, comfortable rooms and excellent service.  The included breakfast was wonderful as well.  It was great to end the day of sightseeing on the rooftop lounge that also has bar service during the day.  Made our trip to the beautiful city of Barcelona even better than expected.",5,2017,05,01
23,Believe what they say location is the perfect - THE Epicenter for tourist activities and more,"Our stay with a couple and a baby was wonderful.  They had a cot in the room and gave our baby some of her own ""products"" for bath time.  The staff was very friendly, the decor of the property was great, Jennifer for us was pleasant too.  Book early in summer I suspect since this place will surely fill up.  It was too chilly during our stay but one step on to the rooftop pool deck and you will realize you have some of the best views of the city right at your hotel.  Would have been great to chill there for a drink before hitting the town.",5,2017,05,01
23,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,A lovely welcome from the fabulous staff (plus glass of bubbles) and a gorgeous room.  Nothing was too much trouble for the hotel staff and they helped us with a lost suitcase in transit. also. Terrific food and central location - our stay was an absolute delight - thank you to all!,5,2017,04,30
23,Great Hotel,Great hotel in the heart of Barcelona. Jennifer in reception was fantastic. The staff throughout the hotel understand what great service is.The Wine and the restaurant staff were great. The roof top deck is a great spot to view the city. The only complaint is breakfast. 18 Euros seems a little high for a breakfast buffet. We would definitely stay there again.,5,2017,04,30
23,Barcelona,"Stayed in this hotel for two nights over the Easter weekend and loved every minute of it. From the welcome from the concierge and reception staff to dining in the fantastic tapas restaurant. If you thought tapas was just Patatas bravas and garlic mushrooms you need to eat here!! 

The style of the hotel is very much a boutique theme. Our room wasn't huge but was brilliantly designed! The roof top terrace has spectacular views and is great place to relax after exploring Barcelona!!",5,2017,04,27
23,"Fabulous hotel, great location, great breakfast","I scrutinized a lot of hotel reviews before deciding to book this one for our trip to Spain in April 2017, and I'm so glad this all worked out so nicely.  The Ohla had a clean, big, modern room, a great breakfast, friendly staff, and a central location.  And they also have a terrific onsite restaurant (Plassohla).  All in all, a great choice for a getaway!",5,2017,04,26
23,"Central location, friendly staff","The location is excellent, on Via Laietana midway between Playa Catalunya and the seafront and situated in Gotica close to La Rambla and the Born district. 
Building is very interesting with good cafe/bar, cocktail bar and rooftop terrace with excellent views. 
We had a Junior suite which was spacious and well appointed. Good bed, plenty of wardrobe space and a lovely bath and shower. 
Staff always willing to help so highly recommended overall. ",5,2017,04,24
23,A real 5* Hotel in a perfect location!,"Well placed 5* Hotel in the Gothic Quarter with pleasant staff, lovely big clean rooms and a small but beautiful pool terrace.  15 minute taxi ride from the airport.  We found excellent Tapas Bars, restaurants and shopping on our doorstep.  Tour bus stops within 10 minute walk, 40 minute walk to Sagrada Familia, 12 minutes to Casa Botelli.  Would definitely recommend the Tour bus red route on arrival which gives a good understanding of the layout of Barcelona. You must book tickets prior to your arrival, luckily we had, as if not, most of the attractions were already sold out ! Be warned. We found the Montjuic Cable Car a bit expensive as does not include entry to castle.  We had a slight issue with our cleaner removing an unfinished bottle of Cava whilst we popped out for nibbles to have with it later but as mentioned to reception in passing it was removed from our bill before we even had to ask!  Would be good if pool bar stayed open later on a nice day though!  That is our only criticism!",5,2017,04,18
23,Great stay,"The hotel has perfect location in the central part of the city, our room was nice and spacious, but if you don't like the ""bathroom in the bedroom"" trend you should consider another hotel as the shower is in a close proximity to the bed and so is the sink. The room and the 00 are a bit dark though. The breakfast is great, hoewever we didn't have any other meals at the hotel as we were wandering around the city. The roof terrace has a great view and offers a place to relax. The staff is kind and helpful.",5,2017,04,17
23,Great stay at Ohla,We had a weekend city break in Barcelona at the end of March. The hotel is centrally placed and very convenient for central Barcelona. The decor is contemporary and stylish. There is a FANTASTC restaurant in the hotel where we were seated around a station in the kitchen watching our meal being prepared before us. The multi course taster menu experience was out of this world!,4,2017,04,15
23,Pitch Black,"The outside of the building is very nice and quite impressive. The interior it painted all in black, which in the reception area is fine, but along the corridors to your room it is very, very dark. We had to shine the light from our phone to see the numbers on the lift for example. 

The room we had was quite small (305), but adequate. I'm really not sure this is a genuine 5 star hotel however, it all seemed pretty basic. Perhaps I am just old and not very trendy anymore, but it seemed it was minimalist fashion over comfort.

Now, the bathroom.  If my husband and I were fit and trim and in the first throws of youthful love, it would have been quite a giggle and possibly quite sexy. However, the shower being like ""The Cube"" TV program in the middle of the room with no privacy was the most unsexy thing ever! Overweight middle aged people washing their bits in full view of their spouse sitting on the bed (laughing) was about as erotic as a tooth extraction.  Also the loo, which thankfully has a door, was pitch black as well.

If you like that industrial chic look you will love this hotel, if you want something a little more sumptuous, look elsewhere.  We went up to the bar on the roof to see the view - it was sunny and very warm, lots of people up there but the bar was closed which was a bit odd.

The staff, it must be noted, were excellent.",4,2017,04,15
23,"Most pleasant experience, excellent location, stunning roof view","Not my first time in this very classy hotel, but again an enchanting experience.  Very kind and pro-active staff (Mathieu is a great concierge), quiet and very comfortable rooms and amenities, breakfast is gorgious, the rooftop offers a unique view on the historic center.",5,2017,04,15
23,So sad to leave this heaven in town,"We spent 5 night with our 6 years old daughter in a junior suite. Not only is the hotel really nice and well located but the staff is so kind (special thanks to David the concierge, always here to help us but in general all staff members from front desk to cleaning ladies were really friendly and helpful) and the room looked so lovely. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. 

",5,2017,04,14
23,Gorgeous Rooftop Pool + View,"We loved our stay at the Ohla Barcelona Hotel for its gorgeous views, great location, friendly staff, and comfortable rooms. The hotel is centrally located in the Gothic quarter and we had a lovely room on the 6th floor. Our favorite aspect of the hotel was its quirky art and beautiful rooftop pool and deck. We enjoyed the sunset views and comfortable lounge area. Highly recommend!",5,2017,04,10
23,Wonderful hotel,"This is a great hotel in a perfect location for exploring the city and all it's delights. Without doubt, the best welcome we've experienced - the staff are very friendly and the glass of bubbles at check in got our stay off to a brilliant start! The concierge service was excellent, providing all the information we needed, printing tickets for our pre-arranged visits to various sights and offering to organise anything else we might need. We stayed in an 'essential' room which was very comfortable, cleaned, tidied and replenished everyday. The rooftop terrace was delightful, offering a peaceful place to chill out and enjoy views of the city in the sunshine; breakfast was really good, with a great variety of options on offer, as was supper in the tapas restaurant. It is the staff who make this place special, however, and it is them who make this hotel a truly 5 star experience.",5,2017,04,10
23,"Lovely hotel, centrally located, with helpful staff","I chose this hotel because of its location close to the Gothic quarter and the Pl. de Catalunya and the Metro, and for my special occasion weekend it was perfect. 

The hotel is in a classical style building, typical of so many in Barcelona, but with contemporary rooms (mine was a superior) and all the facilities you'd expect from a boutique hotel. My room was on the 5th floor, on the side of the building above Carrer Comtal, so no traffic or street noise. The shower had three glass sides, so was unusual, and it sat towards the centre of the room too. Tea and coffee making facilities, mini bar, toiletries all provided and a decent size flat screen TV too. Dressing gowns and slippers also are provided. The bed was massive, and supportive, some my find it a bit firm, but that's how I like beds. 

The staff, particularly reception staff, were excellent, courteous, friendly and helpful, having a very good command of English. I'd forgotten some print-at-home tickets for the Nou Camp, but had emailed the PDF to another email account, which meant I could log on, forward them to the hotel who printed them for me.

The weekend was to celebrate a significant birthday and on the day, the hotel had left a bottle of bubbly in my room - a fantastic gesture, that was very much appreciated and enjoyed on the rooftop. 

The roof-top swimming pool affords some great views of the city, particularly at dusk. For the quality of the hotel, the breakfast selection was wide and varied, with scrambled egg/bacon/sausage/tomato or continental. however if you like strong English tea, take your own bags like I did, those provided were a bit weak. Also the milk is full cream, no apparent option of skimmed or semi-skimmed which is common in the UK. Omelettes available to order. 

The location of the hotel lends itself to exploring by foot, the Gothic area being 5-7mins walk, and you just want to keep walking and exploring. On our first day we walked more than 5 miles. 

For getting to other parts of the city, there are plenty of metro and local rail choices at Pl de Cataluyna, but be aware, Metro lines L1 and L3 are on the east side of the square off Passeig de Gracia, the others L6/7, S1/2/5/55 are best accessed from the south west corner at the top of Las Ramblas - the signage under the square leaves an awful lot to be desired. 

You can eat at the hotel, but there are so many choices depending on what you fancy - see my independent restaurant review elsewhere. 

I'd recommend the hotel to anyone, and have no hesitation about booking there again.",5,2017,04,05
23,Excellent hotel,"The hotel exceeded our expectations.  The staff were friendly and helpful, the room spacious, the pool area very comfortable, and the breakfast was of a high standard.  We ate in the tapas restaurant and it was possibly one of the best meals we have ever had.  If we return to Barcelona we will certainly book the Hotel Ohla.",5,2017,04,04
23,Fantastic location for a great hotel,"Perfectly located in the old town, the rooms are space and perfectly set up. Service was perfect and concierge very helpful and service minded.
The breakfast room is stunning and pastries delicious. The pool on the roof top is too small to swim but chilling there is purely breathtaking.
The only negative point was the bed. It's unbelievable that you get such a hard mattress in that kind of hotel. Got back pain... :/",4,2017,04,02
23,Felt right at home at Hotel Ohla,"Spent three nights at Hotel Ohla Barcelona in a Junior Suite. Fantastic location, our room was spacious and well furnished (bed was very firm). My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and received a bottle of Cava from the hotel, it was a great welcome gift. Breakfast each morning was buffet style. The ""hot"" food items in the buffet were luke warm (only negative of our stay) but you can have eggs cooked to order. The gym is small but you do have a choice of treadmill, bike or cross trainer. The roof top pool was open but it was too cold to swim in. The view from the pool was great, particularly at night time. Staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the surrounding area.There was great shopping, eating and drink all around the hotel. Enjoyed our stay and we will be back. ",5,2017,04,01
23,Simply stunning service and amazing staff,Myself and my partner spent two nights at this hotel and were thrilled with the hotels facilities and even more impressed by the attentive nature and amazing customer focused attitude. We were made to feel very special and will be returning again in the future......,5,2017,03,31
23,Great Boutique Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Ohla.  Was on my 50th birthday trip with my husband.  The bar downstairs is quaint and has fabulous drinks and music.  The room was nice, relatively spacious and clean.  The only weird thing is that the shower was open for the whole room to see.  It was basically a glass shower with a view of the whole room and the whoever was in the room could see you showering.  Wasn't much of an issue because I was with my husband.  Not sure if all the rooms are like this, but I would enquire before booking my room.  There is also a really cool swimming pool on the roof with a beautiful view of the city. Very nice restaurant inside the hotel as well. It is located in a perfect spot within walking distance to almost everything in downtown Barcelona.",4,2017,03,30
23,WONDERFUL !!,"Hotel Olha is every bit as good as it says . 5Star & more. Superb from start to finish. Wonderful rooms. Views from Roof Top area very special. Breakfast amazing quality & choice. All the staff were cheerful, kind, & very willing to advise. The new Wine Bar is a must, such quality & prices are very reasonable. Good restaurant for lunch & dinner.
Nothing to fault & YES we would return , which says it all.",5,2017,03,30
23,"Great hotel.  Historic, with modern updates","I rarely give 5 stars - this hotel gets one.  The building has history, being a former police station.  The updates are modern and classy.  It's upscale without being pretentious.  Staff was excellent, very friendly and helpful.  Onsite drinks and dining were very good.  Complimentary drinks were provided, and the breakfast buffet was one of the best ever.  The coffee at breakfast could put Starbucks out of business.",5,2017,03,27
23,Honest five stars!,"The hotel is located in the center of the Gothic Quarter. Everything inside is new, clean, neat! Room is comfortable, spacious, original layout. Great breakfast, great restaurant. The staff is very helpful and friendly.",5,2017,03,25
23,"Spoil yourself, just book it!  You'll not regret it, this hotel is amazing.","I can fault nothing, it's location is central and beside a subway station.  The staff were magnificent, the concierge in particular could not have been more friendly and helpful, we set him many tasks and he rose to the occasion every time. The rooftop pool, although not open when we stayed, has the most fabulous views over the city.

The rooms were spotlessly clean, luxurious, beautifully furnished to a very high specification, comfortable, cool and quiet, amazingly even our room which overlooked the busy main road.  All the usual amenities were available and even some notable extras in the minibar like jars of jelly sweets and olives. The bathroom in our deluxe room was open plan with a separate toilet, and the huge shower is definitely not for the shy!

Breakfast was delicious and plentiful with a most amazing selection of hot and cold dishes. The mini sized fruit muffins are to die for.

If you are looking for a special break and a little luxury, I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2017,03,24
23,The perfect place to get engaged!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was amazing!
The junior suite is perfect for couples, there's enough space, it's bright and minimalist. 
Nothing was missing by the breakfast. The sauna is a lovely spot to relax. And the staff  was the most friendly staff ever, they've helped my boyfriend (now fiancé :)) to prepare the proposal so carefully from the reservation in the roof terrace till the delicious chocolate cake. 
Amazing experience!!! *****",5,2017,03,20
23,Calm in the city,"Our second visit to Barcelona and we again stayed at Hotel Ohla as it served us so well last time, and it proved a good choice again. The staff are thereto help with whatever question you throw at them, and there room was a haven of calm and coolness above the heat and noise of the city. As was the roof bar terrace with its views over the city. I would recommend staying, especially if you want to explore the old town Gothic and El Ravel. ",5,2017,03,18
23,Quality,"A well situated stylish hotel with superior customer service, nothing was too much trouble.
Easy to get to from the aerobus and well placed for bar restaurants and cafes.
The rooms are spacious with a interesting bathroom arrangement that is fun for couples. Fabulous",5,2017,03,12
23,Funky rooms and superb breakfast,"A great boutique hotel that is strong on design without skimping on comfort. The all glass shower in the middle of bedroom was fun! A good hotel must serve a good breakfast, and the quality of the breakfast food and service was first class. 

Concierge staff were very helpful and the Tapas restaurant was good quality. The beds were comfy.

The pool isnt heated so can't be used in winter. The roof terrace was still lovely in the sunshine though.",5,2017,03,12
23,Very artistic,"My husband and I stayed at ohla hotel which was an excellent choice. The hotel is situated near all attractions at a walking distance. It has everything you need right around it.. a supermarket, restaurants, fast food, coffee shops etc. The room was always clean, and the staff was very nice! The hotel is very artistic, the lobby is very nice and he room was very modern. I loved the shower right in the middle of the room with clear walls lol easy to watch tv while taking a shower. The rooftop is amazing! The view specially during sunset was awesome! Would absolutely recommend this hotel to family and friends when they travel to Barcelona! ",5,2017,03,11
23,SHORT BREAK,"Beautiful design. Service was excellent.
Perfect location, situated between the old city and the hip restaurant/bar scene.
Rooftopbar with swimming pool is also an extra ... there you can enjoy a drink while enjoying a view over the city.
",4,2017,03,05
23,Great option for central Barcelona,"The hotel is centrally located and within easy reach of the main Metro lines at Playa Catalunya. The rooms are modern, well appointed, and the bed was very comfortable. They also do a great breakfast that was included in our room rate, and the restaurant was also of a good standard and an easy fall back if you don't feel like going out. 

Try asking for a higher floor room on booking if you are easily disturbed. The hotel is next to a busy road and my brother who had a room on the first floor did have some room noise. My room on the 7th floor had no noise issues. ",4,2017,03,04
23,Cosy but stylish hotel,"Went for 2 nights. Great location, just fare enough from the noisy and crowded La Rambla, but close to all type of shops and restaurants. Very friendly staff. Nice and warm welcome. Rooms are very clean, but a bit on the small side. Nevertheless stylish. Comfortable bed. Great choice for a short visit.",5,2017,03,03
23,"Location, service and lovely rooms","We stayed in room 306 which is a junior suite looking out over the front of the hotel.  Room had lots of space and everything worked well.  Service was excellent.  Room service menu is small but food was high quality.

Only thing we could think of to improve was increase number of English speaking channels on tv.

The location is fantastic, seems to be 10 mins walk to pretty much anywhere!  

Would come back again!!!",5,2017,02,26
23,Sophisticated modern elegance in the heart of Barcelona,"What a gem Hotel Ohla Barcelona truly is. When you are reading reviews on sites like TripAdvisor or Yelp, you always have to take them with a grain of salt since you don't know the reviewers' value backgrounds are relative to yours.  With Hotel Ohla Barcelona, there should be a universal understanding that this is a first class operation.

Hallmark of a 5-star hotel, in my opinion, is attention to details without revealing the efforts in the background, whether talking about facilities, amenities or services and Hotel Ohla Barcelona aces all categories. We had a Junior Suite reserved but got upgraded to a Junior Suite Deluxe at the time of check-in.  Room was very well appointed with modern yet very comfortable furniture, big floor length windows overlooking Via Laietana. Yet we heard barely any street noise or sounds from neighboring rooms, a sign of good sound proofing.  Also worth noting is quality of breakfast buffet if you had it included with your reservation.  

Location was also very central and convenient.  A block away from Urquinaona Metro station, less than 5 min walk to Palau de la Musica and the Cathedral, 10 min walk from most other Gothic Quarter sites. Take a leisurely walk toward La Rambra and you'll have wide variety of dining options available.

But really what made Ohla Barcelona a stand out is its staff.  Reception team to concierge to bell person to bartenders, they were all extremely attentive and professional, and provided exceptional service throughout our stay.  Quality and level of service was indeed 5 stars and on par with Four Seasons or Conrad or any other 5 star hotels.

One last tip.  If you book directly on their website, you will receive free cocktail at the bar on the evening of your arrival, and 20% off coupon for the tapas restaurant on the ground floor.  We thoroughly enjoyed every part of our 3 night stay at Ohla Barcelona.",5,2017,02,26
23,Central and top class,"If you are looking to stay somewhere in central Barcelona that has the little bit extra with service and comfort, then this is your place!

After all the mad stories I was anxious about how we were going to get from the airport to the hotel and hadn't booked anything. After looking online the best option was to go to the AEROBUS stand outside the terminal which you can buy the tickets on the bus. We stayed on until we got into the main square and the last stop on the route which left us just around the corner from the hotel.

KEEP ALL YOUR BELONGINGS IN A ZIPPY COAT POCKET AND OUT OF SIGHT FOR EASY ACCESS FOR PICK-POCKETS. If you do this you'll have no problem at all and can enjoy your holiday.

From the moment that we arrived through the front door, we were met by concierge who took our bags off us and taken to the reception where we were offered champagne and snacks which was a pleasant surprise. The room was not ready as we had arrived early but they kept our bags in storage and we headed on to explore the city.
We got a junior suite which was clean and comfortable with a lovely street view. It had a little kitchen area, living area, bath and shower, mini bar, ironing board and lots of little lovely toiletries. You could request sewing kits, shoe shiner, shavers, toothbrush and anything else you needed the list was surprising and the staff were so obliging.

The centre and bustle is a very short walk away... literally, a block or two from where the bus gets in and Las Ramblas was in the next street with lovely rooftop restaurants and bars. 

Tapas tapas tapas everywhere, you will be asked for the menu in English or in Spanish, scratch up on your Spanish as sometimes the prices are different depending on which menu you get! There is a good free app called DUOLINGO which will teach you the basics.

What could have gone better with this hotel?

Service while at the hotel - flawless!
Pool and rooftop - construction going on which was disappointing and no notification about this prior to visit
Bar and restaurant - expensive for basic cocktails and drinks
Communication - very poor - had requested early check in and a car from the airport - no response at all.
Had also requested they contact when the room was ready - no contact at all...

Overall, still a gorgeous and comfortable hotel",4,2017,02,26
23,5-Star Hotel!,"First impression: the parking lot is difficult to locate. We had to go around a couple of times and ask the concierge for instructions. Once they took care of the parking matter, the hole experience changed for the best. This hotel takes care of very little details. They take service to their guests very seriously. The personnel from the concierge are always willing to help everybody. Particularly Miguel and Mathieu were very helpful and took good care of all our needs. 
Interestingly, and very well executed, the reception area is secluded to provide a more personal and relaxed experience during the check in and check out.
Room: We book a junior suite. Very nice, modern, clean and beautifully decorated. Bed and pillows are very comfortable! Considering that the hotel is located near the street, we did not perceive the loud noise typical for big city hotels. Wifi was very good. Room had safe and minibar with all the usual amenities. Water is complimentary.
Bathroom: very clean, amazing toiletry products! The brand they use is worthy of purchasing. 
Breakfast: good, very good coffee and juices
Bar: excellent! , probably the best martini I have had in my life!
Restaurant: tapas restaurant La Pasciola is exquisite! Great cousin and amazing service. Luis and Xavier took great care of us.
Terraza: there is a terrace with a pool and a very nice view at the 8th floor. It was closed for the winter season for outside customers but guests are allowed to visit it. It is really nice and seems to be popular because many people visit the hotel asking for access to the terrace. 
Overall: this is the hotel to stay in Barcelona. They take everything in consideration to make you feel taken care off. Congratulations to the manager for a great job!",5,2017,02,24
23,Fabulous ,All round excellent . I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return . In fact friends have booked already based on our recommendation ! Congratulations Ohla Barcelona! You deserve your success . ,5,2017,02,23
23,Stylish boutique hotel,"A lovely gem of a boutique hotel in central Barcelona, the concierge team are faultless - knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Check in was easy , made even easier with a complimentary glass of Cava. We had a junior suite which was lovely , my only reservation being that we were on floor 1 and therefore not only did we hear the road noise but the room shook every time an underground train went past. Breakfast was varied and good. Definitely recommend it but ask for a room on a higher floor",4,2017,02,22
23,Restaurant so good we went back the next day,"Fabulous staff, very welcoming and not at all stuffy. Good choice on menu, everything we had and everything we saw was divine! Word of warning if you like cava, enjoy it in the restaurant as it went up from €4.50 in there to €7.50 a glass in the cocktail bar. Would definitely go back 
",5,2017,02,20
23,Fantastic Hotel,The location of the hotel is great. In the right city center. We got our room at the backside of the hotel so there were no noise at all. Sleeping quality was great. Service is good. The pool looked amazing.,5,2017,02,14
23,Very welcoming ,"We stayed at Hotel Ohla for a long weekend. Upon arriving we were welcomed very friendly and the staff was super-helpful throughout the whole stay. 
The location is very central and many attractions can be reached by foot.
The breakfast buffet had excellent choice and was of very high quality.
The only minor issue was that the pillowcase was dirty upon arrival - at a hotel of this class that shouldn't happen and I therefore give ""only"" 4 stars.",4,2017,02,13
23,That's what 5 Stars gets you!,"We moved to the Ohla after a rather bad experience at a so called 4 Star Hotel in the Gothic Area. The difference was clear. This is an excellently run Hotel that oozes class. Fantastic friendly service, experienced, informed and polite staff and excellent Location and Restaurant. Right in the heart of the action, walking distance for all the shopping etc. The Terrace was under maintenance at this time of the year, so no pool or service up top, but that was not really a surprise and the prices I think reflect that. Would definitley recommend to anyone wanting a great ""first time experience"" in Barcelona, who doesn't mind paying a little more for quality and service.",5,2017,02,13
23,Fab 4 night stay in such a lovely hotel,"I chose this hotel because of how great the TripAdvisor reviews are, customers can't seem to get enough of this place.

Did it meet our expectations - 100%! Before we even got there, I'd prearranged some surprise goodies to be available in the room to celebrate my fiancées 30th birthday. The entertainment staff had been really helpful via email and organised everything I'd asked for. 

When we got to the hotel, we were greeted with cava and went to our room to enjoy the alcohol and goodies I'd arranged. We hadn't been in the room for more than an hour eating chocolate and drinking cava when we had a knock on the door and were greeted with a bottle of red wine and more amazing chocolates. Such a warm welcome!

We were in a deluxe design room, with breakfast as part of the booking. We stayed for 4 nights. The room itself feels very spacious for the actual size of it, I imagine it's the cleverly laid out bathroom. It had everything  we needed and more.

The only thing I'd say about the room is it's probably not as suitable for sharing if you're not a couple - or a couple that has been together for quite a while at least! The shower is a clear glass cubicle almost in the centre of the room and there's really no hiding! It wasn't a problem for us but I can just imagine someone booking this room with their friend or something by accident.

The actual room facilities were great, the shower was fab, towels were changed everyday and your room is made up twice a day! Once in the morning for cleaning etc and then in the evening your room is prepared for sleeping, with some chocolates on your pillow and a note to tell you what the weather will be like the next day - so sweet!

We received a voucher for the cocktail bar downstairs in the hotel and visited it twice during our stay. The bar is priced as you would expect for a 5 star hotel and the cocktails and service was lovely. 

The only thing I was a little sad about was that the rooftop bar was closed because it's out of season. I should have really expected it because of the time of year but the amazing views from the rooftop bar was one of the main reasons I chose this hotel. You could still walk out onto the rooftop but there was people in doing work on the pool, the bar was closed and it was pretty windy! No ones fault, was just a bit gutted I couldn't see it in all its glory!

All in all, the stay was fab, we had excellent service from everyone who worked there and we'd recommend Ohla to anyone visiting Barcelona. Especially if you are travelling in season months and get to take advantage of the fab rooftop bar/ pool too!! ",5,2017,02,12
23,Stunning Boutique Hotel in the city centre,The fact that you can get on a plane from London and be sipping a cocktail in Barcelona 6 hours later means its THE place to take a mini break.  We decided to stay in the centre of the city at this wonderful hotel.  The hotel had space so upgraded our room for us as we were newly weds on our first break away after our long gone honeymoon.  The hotel itself is situated in the most perfect area of the city but once you close the doors you feel like you leave the noise and the bustle of the city behind.  Our suite was quite spacious seeing as we are in the crowded centre of this buzzing place.  The design of the whole place was so impressive and we spent lots of time saying 'I want that lamp!' The food at the hotel was amazing and we highly recommend the cocktail bar that is known far and wide for its drinks!,5,2017,02,01
23,Beautiful Barcelona,We had to contact this hotel several times and they responded promptly and with efficiency. We arrived to a wonderful reception and had a junior suite. The room was spacious and well designed. The only problem was with reading lights by the bed. The bathroom was very well designed also. The coffee maker was a plus as well. We went to the hotel restaurant Passohla which was superb. Service in the hotel was professional and accommodating. The breakfast was lovely the next day. The location of the hotel was perfect since it is in the historical part of the city. We enjoyed our visit. The only downside are the black hall ways and staircases not ideal for people with poor eyesight. Still it was a. Delightful experience.  ,5,2017,01,25
23,Great hotel - very friendly,"Stayed for three days / two nights as a winter getaway from a cold UK. Lovely hotel and really friendly English speaking staff. Great location, fresh and modern room, lovely breakfast so couldn't ask for more.",5,2017,01,21
23,Wonderful stay!!!!,"We had a exceptional experiencie at Ohla Hotel. The service was great. The room very clean and the location was perfect for us. The staff is very professional, management send us few presents to the room, that was amazing,Jose one of the staff members he eager to help us, thank you Jose 👍. We really enjoy our time in the hotel, definitely we recommend it. 

Check in is on the second floor.",5,2017,01,21
23,Wonderful boutique hotel!,"First class all the way - from the moment we stepped in until the moment we left. The concierge and check-in staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. We had a design room on the first floor, which was extremely clean, quiet and well-maintained. Great boutique hotel in a great location for sightseeing and transportation and plenty of dining options are readily available nearby. We were bummed about the pool maintenance as we couldn't take advantage of the amazing rooftop view, but hope to come stay again sometime to see it. So happy I booked this hotel and  would highly recommend staying here!",5,2017,01,20
23,Well located hotel,"4 night stay in January in Junior Suite Deluxe 

Location 

Around 30 minutes from the airport, this hotel is perfectly located to all the major tourist attractions, las rambles less than 5 minute walk, marina 10 minute walk , Cathedral 5 minutes walk .All the major sights and museums are all located within 5-15 minute walk 

Outside the hotel there are plenty if tapas bars, shops and restaurants , plenty of places to eat nearby, supermarket across the road. Starbucks 20 second walk from hotel 

If you prefer to get the aero bus to and from airport I think cost is around 6 euro each way the bus stop is around 5 Minutes walk, apparently they run every 5 min and takes 30-40 mins 

Hotel 

This is a boutique hotel with total 8 floors , 8 floor is the pool area which was closed for refurb when we were there (did look nice for summer )

It's very clean and modern , a 5 star property, there is a gym on site, bar and restaurant 

Staff all very friendly concierge were great always willing to help and give advice, all staff very approachable and friendly with great English ( if you don't speak Spanish )

Breakfast opened 7-11
This was included in the rate, choice is limited and if not included could be expensive for what you get. 

Food provided is nice, more continental however there is egg,bacon and sausage in the 3 hot plate ,

 lots of places for breakfast just outside hotel.

Room

We stayed junior suite deluxe for 4 nights , separate bath and shower floor to ceiling windows , sofa desk  large double bed etc . the room faced the busy street however you couldn't hear the traffic, well sound protected, nice amenity , nespresso coffee machine with 6 pods complimentary , also kettle with normal coffee/tea .. mini bar snacks , complimentry water 2 /3 bottles each day . Bvgari shower gel, soap, shampoo.

At night time room is prepaired for sleeping with chocolate, weather card, and a general tidy up (if required) which is nice touch.

This hotel/stay was great however I have only given it 4 stars because of the following otherwise would of been 5.

By 15.00 the room each day had still not been cleaned , each day had to call to get housekeeping to refresh room, there are other comments on trip about this. It's not such an issue if your out from 9-6 however we like to come back early afternoon to refresh and rest however couldn't with an unmaid room. The problem is that it happened every day with late housekeeping.

Apart from that it's an amazing well located hotel with great staff",4,2017,01,20
23,"Wonderful hotel, great location","We had a wonderful experience at Ohla Barcelona. The staff was very nice and friendly; concierge great with restaurant options. The deluxe room was comfortable, well-appointed. Enjoyable rainfall shower and all the amenities. The location was great; we walked everywhere, restaurants, museums, and other attractions. The metro and Aerobus to the airport were nearby as well. Would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona. ",5,2017,01,18
23,New Year in Barcelona,"Very pleased with the location. Very close to the cathedral and La Rambla.  
Glass of Cava at check in was a nice touch.  
Our room was a good size and very clean.
The shower door did not close properly meaning each time we took a shower the bathroom floor was flooded.
Not what I expect in a 5* hotel.
The hotel had a special dinner for New Years Eve, but at €125 per head we didn't bother.  Had a lovely meal in town at a fraction of the cost.
The bar was very nice, but hardly anyone used it as it was very expensive. €16 for a gin and tonic!  Surely it would be better to charge less and have customers.
Would stay again and recommend to others, but wish the prices for food and drinks were more reasonable.",4,2017,01,16
23,A lovely hotel in a great location,"This hotel is located in the gothic part of the city and is just a short walk from quite a few landmarks and good restaurants the city of Barcelona has to offer.

The hotel room was very modern - check out the bathroom, lovely - clean and comfortable with very good room facilities and toiletries.

The view from the roof top terrace is amazing and gives it the ""wow"" factor - enjoy a cocktail while taking in the beautiful sights. The restaurant is good and we enjoyed our meal there as well as breakfast every morning of our stay - plenty of choice - and a good start to the day.

The staff were extremely helpful and very polite.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",4,2016,12,31
23,Perfect Hotel for our stay in Barcelona ,"My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Ohla Barcelona for a few days of rest and relaxation after her semester abroad.  Hotel Ohla did not disappoint!  The hotel was located in the beautiful gothic district.  A prefect location in my opinion.  We were walking distance of most tourist sites.  The staff at the Ohla was helpful, friendly and very accommodating.  Our room was very spacious for being a boutique hotel.  The hotel's restaurant served a nice breakfast buffet every morning and had a delicious menu for the evening.  Very unique and delicious tapas.  Hotel Ohla will be our hotel of choice when we visit Barcelona again!",5,2016,12,30
23,"Great hotel, great location!",We did not expect much of ths property but wnted something in a good location to be able to do some shopping and sightseeing. We have been to Barcelona many times before but this time we wanted to stay in a modern place. Ohla was a great choice and a great value. Highly recommended!,5,2016,12,29
23,haven in bustling city,"Booked after reading other tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. greeted with glass of bubbles whilst checking in. room was spacious, clean and well laid out. 

The main pull of the hotel is the roof-top pool - which has great seating in comfy ""booths"" with table, sun loungers or high stools at the edge to look out over the city and mountains. We were slightly disappointed the bar wasn't open (but it was November), but we were told drinks could be brought up from the ground floor bar. the pool isn't heated - but that didn't deter a dip! 
Also, the pool area was closed for one day due to some private filming - but they were packed up and gone by the evening. 

The breakfast was lovely - as you would expect from this 'star' hotel - great pastries, cooked food, fruit etc and service with a smile.

Concierge were great with 'what to do' and booking tickets and arranging a taxi back to the airport.

There is also a gym and small hairdressers and spa (although not used by us!)

There was one day that we arrived back at the room at 4.45pm and it had still not been serviced - we were told that room service could happen anytime up to 5pm - which we didn't really think was acceptable, as we then had to leave the room whilst it was being cleaned. Also the complimentary coffee / milk was rarely refilled - but was when requested. For these 2 reasons a ""very good"" rather than ""excellent"".",4,2016,12,23
23,JUST PERFECT!,"This has to be one of the best hotels ever!  First class welcome with glass of Cava - lovely room, gorgeous big soft bath sheets, dressing gowns and slippers.  Fabulous comfortable bed and linen, toiletries including all you could need.  We could want for nothing - just absolutely perfect.  We hope to return!",5,2016,12,11
23,Very good hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Great base for tourist trips, evening meals, shopping and the beach. Great staff who are all great. We would stay here again.

The roof terrace was a great feature - probably too cold for us to use much when we were there but can imagine it is very popular in the summer months.",4,2016,12,01
23,Hip! & Energetic!,"Our first visit to Barcelona.Location of the hotel to major sites etc was important to us. The hotel is perfectly located right at the Gothic quarter with walking distance to everything. You can have easy access to Las Ramblas & Eixample area also. Right outside your door is great unique shopping ( not big chains) & authentic Tapas restaurants in both Gothic and Born district. I recommend a stroll thru the alley ways of both around 4-8pm. The hotel has a very nice full breakfast with excellent choices of juices, cereal, fruit, eggs, meats etc. You won't be disappointed. The breakfast staff is amazing. The entire staff actually is amazing. All of the front desk people are extremely helpful and knowledgeable on everything from getting to historic sites, transportation, restaurant recommendations and history of the area. We stayed in the Junior Suite room 404. Nice quiet location and very spacious open floor plan. The view was wonderful of historic buildings and a busy street scape ( but never noisy). The bathroom is wide open to the main room which may not be for everyone. But plush towels/bathrobes etc. Comfortable bed & pillows. I highly recommend a trip to the rooftop which is an exceptional spot with a great view of the City at night & pool. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy a drink. We had dinner in the restaurant on our last night. Sunday night with a nice Jazz band. Nice way to end our trip. The wait staff was beyond friendly & helpful. the tapas are excellent. The bar is also a hip place to hang out. I highly recommend using the train system which is easy to use along with the hop on hop off buses for site seeing. With the Christmas holiday there was an outdoor Christmas Market right by the hotel which made it even more festive.  We really enjoyed our stay, Barcelona is a beautiful city and would stay here again.",5,2016,12,01
23,Pre-conference weekend,"We stayed at Ohla Barcelona for two nights during the weekend before a conference in the city. The location is perfect, short walking distance to all the attractions near Catalunya Plaza. The room in the hotel was large with very modern design.
Breakfast was rich and delicious and dinner in the hotel's restaurant was exceptional.

To add on all these features excellent hospitality.  This a perfect place for an enjoyable vacation in Barcelona.",5,2016,11,27
23,Fantastic Service,We stayed here for couple a night  and we're very pleased of the service specially the Manager Javier he so kind to us and give us a nice room. Service from housekeeping from bellman to conceirge is fantastic Breakfast is Awesome too. thank you for the service and comfortable bed really recomendable.,5,2016,11,26
23,"Great hotel, wonderful staff, superb service","This was our third time staying at the Ohla.  The staff were wonderful, helpful and friendly.  The accommodations great and the extras welcoming.  Location perfect (in the Gotica two minutes walk from the Palau de la Música Catalana and a short walk to the beach).  We enjoyed the food (innovative tapas) at the restaurant La Plassohla and the lovely breakfasts.  Thanks to all there.  We'll be back.",5,2016,11,26
23,City Break,"We stayed for five nights in November and really enjoyed it. The hotel staff were all very friendly and welcoming, our room was spotless and quiet and the restaurant may well serve the best Tapas in town. Many places of interest are just a short walk away and the rooftop terrace is a lovely retreat in this busy city.",5,2016,11,22
23,"Beautiful hotel, great location","Great boutique hotel in Las Ramblas.  Great central location with gym, and awesome roof-top pool.  The staff was extremely accommodating and polite.  our room was great.  My only complaint was that the walls seemed a bit thin, and we could definitely clearly hear people loudly in the hallway quite easily.  Other than that, no complaints.",5,2016,11,19
23,Great stay,"Great staff, great restaurant, great location.  This hotel has all the amenities and extras you will need to enjoy your vacation, we sure did. The location makes it very walkable to explore and enjoy the heart of the city. ",5,2016,11,18
23,Wonderful Hotel!,The location is great! not far from Placa Catalunya. The hotel is very nice decorated. It looks special outside and inside. Our room at the 4th floor was also great. It has a nice street view from the window .It always had a good smell when we came back to the room at the end of the day:) The staff was friendly and service oriented. They always helped us with a nice smile:),5,2016,11,16
23,From the first step inside...,"Wow.  Friendly, fast, polite.  This is a phenomenal boutique hotel in the Ramblas/Catelunya district of BCN.   Don't bother looking elsewhere if you're young/young at heart and traveling with your couple.

They'll wrap up your breakfast if you have an early departure--which I always do.  ",5,2016,11,09
23,Excellent Barcelona Hotel!,"Having circled the world, and stayed in over 70 countries, we have've stayed in many different hotels.

My fiancé and I stayed at the Ohla hotel prior to our Southern Mediterranean cruise.  The hotel was centrally located, and within walking distance of various attractions!

The front of the hotel is very conspicuous, so you could definitely walk by without knowing it.

Upon entering, the concierge booth greeted you!  You are then escorted to the 2nd floor reception.   A unique check in process, but efficiently and functional for us.

Our room was located on the 2nd floor and offered a view of the garden.  Room was clean and comfortable.  The queen size bed was firm, but not to a point where you would wake up with back issues.

Toilet was located in a hidden room, so an interesting touch.  Rain-head shower was very relaxing!  Overall, bathroom facility was very clean and welled maintained!

Breakfast was included and offered a wide range of options.  Staff was friendly and professional when escorting you to your table, and also bringing you your hot drinks.

Overall an excellent stay!  We look forward to returning to the Ohla hotel after our cruise!!",5,2016,11,09
23,Look elsewhere,"We really disliked the Ohla. So much so, we moved after the first few hours. We arrived to a reception desk in a hallway, and were given a room on the first floor. We opened the curtains, and a seedy looking guy sitting at the bus stop turned and looked at us and nodded. So, the curtains would have to stay closed at all times. That didn't keep out the very loud noises of the buses, train and street however. Earplugs would be necessary. The room had a sofa which had disgusting biologic stains on it, and we had to call housekeeping to get them to scrub it off. We wanted a King bed, but got a queen. The room was cramped, and the glass enclosed shower was in the middle of the room -- maybe that's a trendy thing, but we just found it awkward and uncomfortable. I don't know many 50+ year old experienced American travelers that would like this hotel, at all. They wouldn't move us off that floor, so we and our traveling companions moved hotels to a much nicer quiet place and in a much, much nicer part of town.",1,2016,11,08
23,Great Location,"I stayed there for two nights and am happy I chose this property. The location was great and close to everything I wanted to see. The concierge team (Alberto, Fausto, Daniel and Jose) were very helpful and courteous. I stayed in a deluxe room on the third floor. You can hear the noise from the street but it didn't bother me, but if you are a light sleeper then request a higher floor.

I was driving and I missed the hotel's entrance because it is a bit difficult to see (if you are not driving extremely slowly and ignoring the other drivers horns to pay close attention), so pay good attention and take your time.

Overall, I enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again.",4,2016,11,06
23,Nice rooftop views,"Visited the rooftop bar in October one evening. Service from bar staff was extremely friendly, we were greeted immediately on arrival and we found a space for a drink on one of the canopied seating areas.

Drinks were ok quality but expensive (as expected) so I did expect better. 

Stunning staircase and love the eyes all over the hotel. Walking through the hotel I was glad we picked a different one to stay in, because of the location and overall dark aesthetic. Would return for drinks and views if I was in the area.",4,2016,11,02
23,Stunning Boutique Hotel,"This beautiful 5 star Hotel is right in the heart of Barcelona, you could not wish for a better location. You can have a great shopping experience, you can go to some lovely little Tapas bars, showing the traditional side of Spain. The staff at the Hotel are very welcoming, even a glass of bubbly is waiting for you on your arrival. It is a boutique hotel, so rather modern, but great. Cannot fault any of it, cannot wait to return .",5,2016,11,01
23,Great location and price very good for luxury,Booked room after going on Barcelona cruise. Very centric location can walk to all shopping and nice restaurants nearby. Had breakfast included and they had great variety of fresh fruit juices and breads along with eggs and meats.  The room was great had shower in the center of room which was pretty nice never seen that design in hotel. ,5,2016,10,30
23,Outstanding,My wife and I spent our honeymoon here and ohla truly delivered. Everyone was wonderful from the concierge to front desk giving us directions. For our honeymoon they even gave us a complemetary bottle of champaigne. This hotel is centrally located to the subway and bus with a stop right out side the door of the hotel as well as close to cathedral barcelona. The room was very spacious with a tub next to the shower and toliet all seperated. Toliet door does not have a lock and the shower door is see through. Beds are a bit firm but still comfortable. Only negative was that we arrived from ny and landed at 7am bcn time and room was not ready until 3. They do have a waiting area with free coffee and cava crausants ect and there is no shuttle from the airport but costs 35 euros in a cab. Overall great hotel will definitely come back next time im in bcn,5,2016,10,29
23,Fantastic Stay,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying Ohla Barcelona for 4 nights in October 2016. The location could not be better. It is only a 5 minute walk to Las Ramblas but without the craziness outside your front door! The hotel itself is fantastic in every way. Breakfast cannot be faulted and is served until 11 o clock. The staff are very friendly, helpful and very good at their job. Having a drink made for you in the cocktail bar is an experience not to be missed. The rooms are perfect, clean, comfortable and well equiped. Also they are very spacious for a hotel so central to Barcelona. The tapas served in the restaurant are incredible! The best we had in Barcelona without a doubt, and we have been to the city 3 times. We tried 14 different tapas dishes in two meals so definitely sampled a lot of the menu. This is all without mentioning the rooftop pool and bar! Overall this was a truly fantastic stay for the two of us and I would highly recommend Ohla. We will not be staying anywhere else the next time we visit.",5,2016,10,27
23,Birthday treat,Awesome long weekend with exceptional service! Thank you Quique and the rest of the hotel team. Fabulous cocktails with a rooftop to match. Special thanks for the head waiter who let us enjoy the fireworks and come back to enjoy our dessert. Look forward to visiting again 😉,5,2016,10,18
23,Service. Service. Service.,"My husband and I spent four nights in this hotel. We were especially impressed with the staff of the hotel. Everyone, from the welcome staff to the check-in to the concierge to the restaurant staff were all courteous, kind, and helpful. They really just wanted us to enjoy our stay. The hotel is located in the Gothic Quarter of the city, which is a fascinating and touristy part of town. We are from NYC so the room felt plenty big, but it wasn't huge by any means. The rooms were clean and comfortable (albeit a little funky with the shower in the middle of the room). The gym looked fine, though we didn't use it. And the pool was beautiful, but we didn't use it. The restaurant was fantastic. The food was absolutely delicious and the wait-staff completely lovely. The only thing I found odd about the hotel was that the stairs weren't well lit. I don't know if this was meant to add a hip vibe, but it concerned me that people couldn't see where they were walking! All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,10,16
23,Perfecto! Ohla really delivers,"I visited for 6 nights with my girlfriend and we had a fantastic stay! The location is $$$ because many tours leave from just around the corner. The pool and rooftop deck are sublime and the view is on point. Extremely helpful concierge and our room was always clean. The building facade is surreal and funky (just like BCN) and tourists take photos of it when they pass. The showers are really nice, and the bed was super comfy. We really felt like royalty! The restaurant (La Plassohla) had food that was like a ""religious experience"", and we got the daily breakfast buffet (yaaasssss) as well as ate dinner there one night. The price for La Plassohla is actually quite reasonable considering the quality of the food. Also, the bar at the hotel is swanky as all get out, and they make very memorable drinks that are absolutely delicious. Hot tip: we took the AeroBus from the airport straight to Catalunya plaza and then walked about 10 minutes to the hotel, and it was inexpensive and efficient. The AeroBus leaves every 5 minutes 7 days a week starting at 5 am, so it is a nice way to transfer if you want to save some money for JAMON. I never want to stay anywhere else!",5,2016,10,16
23,Fabulous hotel,"We have recently returned from a 4 night stay in this wonderful city. We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and so pleased we decided on this hotel.  It's a stylish boutique hotel with amazing roof terrace, lovely restaurant and so convenient for the port, shops, restaurants and bars. Can't wait to return.",5,2016,10,15
23,Fabulous Hotel,"We just spent 4 days in Barcelona at this lovely hotel.  Great location, close to the Cathedral, within walking distance of Casa Batllo, Las Ramblas and only 15 minutes to the waterfront. The hotel is very stylish, the staff are delightful (nothing was too much trouble) and our room, a junior suite was very comfortable. We only had breakfast in the hotel but the choice and quality was first class. I highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay there again. It's also a two minute walk to La Tosca, a great little tapas bar with a great atmosphere.",5,2016,10,10
23,Brilliant location. Excellent hotel,"Five days in Barcelona staying at the Ohla. A lovely hotel in an excellent location within walking distance of many sights and attractions. Great service, wonderful food and you must go into the bar and have a cocktail made by the lady there. She makes the whole business of cocktails entertaining and is so knowledgable. The tapas in the la Plassohla restaurant is gorgeous. We had a junior suite over the entrance facing onto the very busy Via Laietana and were not disturbed at all by the traffic sounds. The bed was very comfortable and facilities in the room were very good. All staff were excellent and knowledgable especially the guys in the rooftop pool bar, which was a delight on a balmy Barcelona evening with a cool glass of white wine. Highly recommended.",5,2016,10,08
23,Beautiful hotel,"This was booked for a romantic break in a beautiful city, and did not disappoint,  a boutique hotel with lots of style.  Romantic, stylish, clean and very well positioned.  Would happily go again and again.",5,2016,10,02
23,Fantastic Hotel,"Professional staff, central location thate enabled us to walk nearly everywhere, a sweet room and the rooftop pool make it one of the best places we have ever stayed. The pool alone and it's fabulous view make it worth it alone.",5,2016,09,28
23,Honeymoon,"We had a fantastic time in Barcelona for our honeymoon, topped off by this fantastic hotel. We upgraded to a junior suite. We were on the front of the building, but it was not noisy. Lovely cooling glass of cava as we checked in, and a complimentary bottle also as it was our honeymoon. We ate in the hotel the first night. The tapas was lovely but not your average dishes. Location is brilliant. We walked everywhere. Concierge were very helpful, lots of tips and info. Rooftop pool is lovely, but the drinks are expensive. Breakfast was lovely. Plenty of choice. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona. We would love to return.",5,2016,09,26
23,"Great hotel, rooftop and location","I was very pleased with my stay at Ohla Barcelona, the location was terrific right near the barri gotic and a short walk to the beach and la sagrada familia and la rambla. I had several drinks on the rooftop which was very pleasant and had a terrific view of the catedral de barcelona. I will definitely stay here next time I'm back in barca!",5,2016,09,26
23,Time went to fast....,"Friendly staff welcome you with water or Cava, no brainier took the yummy cava.  Check-in experience was smooth and had a great conversation with the team.  Bags are brought up to the room and any last details about the hotel are explained. 

We reserved a Jr. Suite,  spacious!  We were staying a week and having the added room was great.  Tall ceilings, big picture windows with views of historical buildings and even a slight view of the cathedral.  Plenty of light which made the room feel even bigger.  Bottles of water were provided.   There is a mini frig with various drinks and some snacks on the counter- honor bar.   Bathroom had tub, walk-in shower, hidden water closet (sleek), plenty of closet room and shelves...I could live here!  Beauty mirror and nice toiletries (toothbrush and paste, shampoo,conditioner, lotion, shower cap, shower gel, etc)

Beds were a bit on the hard side for me, but that is my preference.  

Breakfast -  good selection of eggs, meats, fruit, pastries, cheese, fresh juices, coffee, cava.  It was good for self serve.  Cappuccinos rocked with croissants and fruit, happy happy.

Location, perfect to walk everywhere, shop, sightsee, harbor, easy access to buses and taxis right outside the hotel.   Major sights no more than 10 euros by taxi if you chose not to walk.  Plenty of place to eat around you.  Tapas on the roof are great too.  Give them a try, cheese plater and meats.... With sangria...

Rood top bar is just another added perk.... Wait staff was upbeat and friendly.  Made great drink and taps suggestions.

23,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I had a wonderful couple of nights at Ohla Hotel. Warm welcome, great location, magic view and relaxation at the roof's pool. The food on offer is excellent and the room was fantastic. 5 stars",5,2016,09,23
23,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful location, wonderful staff",We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Ohla.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating to all our site-seeing and touristy requests.  We had our 6 year old son with us who was definitely one of the only children in the place.  Although this is not a 'kids hotel' the staff was extremely welcoming and friendly to him at all times.  He played in the rooftop pool for hours doing his best not to splash the patrons and the staff was happy to see a little guy enjoying the beautiful pool.  He loved the 'eyes' on the building and thought they were the coolest thing.  Our room was comfortable and spacious for the 3 of us.  We will always stay at the Ohla when we visit Barcelona.  Our son tells everyone his favorite place he stayed in our 4 weeks in Europe was the Ohla Hotel!,5,2016,09,22
23,EXCEPTIONAL LUXURY!!,We have stayed at the Ohla Hotel 4 times - and never disappointed. From concierge to bar staff the service is extraordinary - cava upon arrival from the attentive and knowledgeable check in express - a very warm welcome! We stay in the junior suite - its perfect - understated and modern luxe - and the views are a Barcelona snapshot. Roof top pool and private pavilions with rooftop bar - restaurant offering exceptional cuisine - hard to venture outside. Location in Barri Gotic is perfect! Stay at Ohla Hotel and be spoilt ............,5,2016,09,19
23,"Beautiful hotel, great location","We absolutely LOVED Barcelona and our hotel was perfect for what we needed- a beautiful, well situated hotel, with a comfortable bed and great location. We walked everywhere from our hotel and enjoyed the friendliness and knowledge of the concierge.
We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,19
23,Fantastic location but its lack of attention to detail was disappointing,"Just returned from a weekend break to Barcelona with my wife to celebrate her birthday. 

After spending hours researching different hotels, we opted for Hotel Ohla. 

Whilst the hotel is in a fantastic location and the rooms are excellent, the hotel let itself down with a lack of attention to detail you would expect from 5 star hotel. 

Before we arrived, we were sent emails asking what type of pillows and fragranced bed sheets we wanted. We also booked a table in advance in the hotel's restaurant (via concierge) as part of our tapas room package. Therefore very disappointing to discover that none of the staff in the restaurant knew anything about our booking or what the tapas package entitled us to and that the well publicised scented bed sheets marketing spin also failed to materialise. When we checked in we were also told our luggage would be taken up to our room - we then headed straight out to explore Barca but disappointing when we came back to the hotel 5  hours later to discover no luggage in our room and that it was still sat downstairs.

Don't want to sound too negative as the hotel has lots of positives and is in great location - just feel that it fell short of what we had expected given its 5 star rating and the content of the other reviews posted regarding this property ",3,2016,09,19
23,Hotel Ohla,"Great 5 star boutique hotel, with great customer service. We checked out of the hotel at 4:00 in the morning and could not make it for the breakfast that was included with our hotel booking. The manager made breakfast to go for us when we checked out so we would not miss out in getting something to eat in the morning on our way to the airport.
What service!!!",5,2016,09,19
23,Fabulous  hotel perfect,The hotel is perfect  location  the hotel  is clean food amazing  staff so very helpful and friendly  nothing was to much trouble  rooms are amazing  and cleaned even day with also a good night turn down of your bed with choices left by your bed side  and to top it all it has an amazing roof top pool with bar  The hotel is just fabulous  and my wife and I had a wonderful time there are will certainly be going back,5,2016,09,18
23,5 Nights,"Hotel Ohla was fantastic!  I was treated kindly and professionally throughout my stay in Barcelona.  The conceirge was incredibly helpful in helping me find my way, as it was my first time in the ciy.

The pool is beautiful and relaxing with an amazing view. Located in the heart of the city, hotel Ohla is a great jumping off point to see the city.

Javier helped me with recommendations and arrangements for a trip over to Ibiza--Thanks Javi!

I highly recommend Hotel Ohla when you come to visit Barcelona--an amazing city!",5,2016,09,18
23,Great location,"Perfect location that was within easy walking distance of las ramblas, the cathedral and all of the little lanes packed with tapas bars. The deluxe design double rooms do have a see through shower literally in the middle of the room (don't worry - toilet is still private!). The hotel is surprisingly dark decor so take care walking down the stairs! Rooftop bar is fabulous in the early evening - take in the view, the breeze and the fabulous cocktails! Breakfasts are also lovely (meats, cheeses, breads, fruit, yoghurt as well as the usual cooked). The Apple, lime and spinach juice is worth a try!",5,2016,09,17
23,Great hotel.,Centrally located 5 star hotel with a wonderful rooftop pool.Outstanding staff and a very good tapas restaurant within the hotel.Highly recommended.Best hotel I have stayed in in Barcelona by a long way.,4,2016,09,15
23,Googly eyed beauty is a gem in downtown Barcelona.,"We reviewed and researched many hotels in the Gothic Quarter and of the top notch hotels, this is the one we chose. Hotel Ohla is beautiful and very modern. The pool on the roof is amazing as the view is incredible. We spent every night on the roof. They have areas that are exclusive to hotel guests and they only let the guests up until a certain time of the day (you need to use your room key and a certain elevator or want to walk up eight floors in their beautiful stairway). We did not have the breakfast but were told by other guests that it was worth it. Our room was very modern - you will play hide-and-go seek with the bathroom door as it was interesting the way it blends in. We had a suite so our shower was not in the center of the room - but we did see one room like that. Interesting to say the least. I found the floor of our shower to be a bit slippery so be careful. The staff is very friendly and the rooms were very well kept. This. Is. An. Amazing. Hotel.",5,2016,09,15
23,Ooh La La!!,"Excellent customer service from the get-go!  They sent a pre-arrival email offering to help with any transfers, etc. and upon arrival offered us a beverage while checking us in.  The roof top terrace and pool are wonderful any time of day and the sunsets are the best from the terrace.  The rooms are spacious (even a standard room)  and having a fresh bottle of still water in the room without charge each day was a treat.  Also, they had black-out curtains, which is a necessity when we travel.  The hotel was walking distance to all the popular tourist sites.  We loved Hotel Ohla and would stay there again and hope to get back to Barcelona to see more sites. Ooh la la for sure!  ",5,2016,09,13
23,Ideal,"I stayed here with some of my family whilst in Barcelona for 4 nights. Perfect hotel to stay in, ideal location! Staff were very attentive and couldn't have been more friendly. Our rooms were lovely, food was great and the cocktails in the bar were excellent. The best part of the hotel is the rooftop pool! ",5,2016,09,13
23,"Perfect location, great hotel and super friendly service","This was our first visit to Barcelona, and we really weren't too sure about where to stay.  We (luckily) settled on the Ohla Barcelona after checking TripAdvisor and Michelin.

After two days exploring this amazing city, we came to the conclusion that the Ohla is in the perfect location to discover Barcelona.  You can walk to virtually every historic location quite easily.  The hotel itself is extremely comfortable - and the breakfast was out of this world - one of the best buffets we have ever experienced.

We used the concierge service quite extensively - and Daniel was incredibly wise and helpful.  The Sagrado Familia is an absolute ""must see"" and it's best to get tickets in advance online.",5,2016,09,13
23,One of the nicest boutique hotels in Barcelona. Centrally located -with everything you need. Amazing rooftop pool!,"Gorgeous rooftop pool and excellent, central location. 

Excellent food, wine list and staff.

Everything you need in a luxury, boutique hotel in Barcelona in central and trendy Barrio Gotica. 

Breakfast is included- parking can be negotiated for longer stays or there is a lot down the street. But you don't really need one.

This is a great hotel - that I would come back to, over and over ...

There is also an Ohla Eixample- that is newly renovated.

Rooftop pool is amazing - view of Catedral Barcelona.. Great bar service. There is a small gym. 

Overall very sexy and convenient little hotel. ",5,2016,09,12
23,Best in Barcelona,"From the moment we stepped into Ohla's lobby the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. They speak perfect English. The hotel is beautiful on the inside with modern amenities, with keeping the old world classic appearance on the outside. Our room was always clean, twice a day in fact. Turn down service at night, with your choice of scents for your bedding, fresh towels, and a small piece of chocolate or cookie. The rooftop pool area is beautiful with an amazing waiter up there,  he was wonderful and attentive. We had dinner one evening in the restaurant which was absolutely outstanding! The location in perfect, close to everything we wanted to do or a quick taxi ride.
If we ever have the opportunity to go back to Barcelona, we would definitely stay here again.
We did a lot of research for our trip, and could not be happier with our choice of hotels.",5,2016,09,11
23,Best ever croissants?,"We stayed for 4 nights in August. After booking it, and before we arrived, we received an e-mail from concierge asking us about a number of choices we had and whether they could do anything for us. This really set the whole tone of the hotel. They could not have been more helpful in every department. The rooms are super-smart, the rooftop pool perfectly big-enough. The only thing I would suggest is that they made their pool-side menu a bit more comprehensive. The food in the restaurant was outstanding and the breakfasts awesome. In fact, I think their croissants might have been the best I have ever eaten! But it was the concierge desk that made numerous restaurant and activity bookings and (sorry) numerous changes all in the greatest of humour really made us feel like guests. A masterclass in what a hotel should make a visitor feel like.",5,2016,09,10
23,love this place,"The location ,the service ,the rooms were all fantastic .The pool and bar on roof with its scenic outlook across the city was outstanding .The pool with its see through sides particularly was unique for fun photo opportunities.",5,2016,09,10
23,fab wkd break,"The hotel is lovely , breakfast was good , the  roof top pool is small but great & the bar staff up there great .The prices of drinks , in the bar downstairs were very high , location is really good . overall we had a lovely stay as Barcelona is an amazing city .",4,2016,09,08
23,Amazing Property in the Mix of it All!,"Loved this hotel.  Great location, staff, food, drinks, and spaces. What more do you need?  If we go back to Barcelona, we will definitely stay there and will recommend it to our friends.  The included breakfast was full and satisfying.  The bar was unlike anything I have experienced.  The bartenders are true magicians.  I ""had"" to order multiple drinks just to watch them make them.  AWESOME!  Oh..and that rooftop. WHAT??  Stay here. Just do it. Book it.",5,2016,09,06
23,Absolutely exquisite hotel,"Nestled right in the middle of down town Barcelona, this amasing hotel boasts incredible rooms, a brilliant roof top pool and a superb cocktail bar downstairs.  We booked the Domme suite; having your own balcony to spend a few hours watching Barcelona pass by is a great way to spend a day.

100% recommended.    ",5,2016,09,06
23,Disappointing and not a five star hotel ,"I have just come back from this hotel and found it disappointing and certainly not a five star hotel.  The building is gorgeous and the location is great but with hotels like this it is meant to be all about the service and little touches.  After all that is what you are paying a premium for. This hotel is just lacking for the following reasons:

Staff: either invisible or unfriendly; there are no greetings when you enter; the turndown service was not done every evening and the toiletries not topped up meaning I had to call down on two occasions to get housekeeping up for soap and towels.  

Rooms: you get offered the option of scented sheets before checking in. This was done twice in the week long stay.  Also the full glass showers in the middle of the room are just odd.  Water goes everywhere and makes the floor slippery.  It also says the rooms are soundproof but you can hear the cleaning staff and people coming and going very easily.

Rooftop: yes this is a stunning view and a cool area, especially at night, but you get an offer to book a chill out area at an extortionate rate when most of the time they are available for free. Save your money. 

My recommendation would be to stay at the Grand Central, also on Via Laietana, or Hotel Arts. They are hotels that ticks all of the boxes. 
",2,2016,09,03
23,Perfect stay,We had a perfect 6 days here at the end of August in room 608. It's a beautiful and light junior suite (deluxe). It was a treat for our wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect from beginning to end. The hotel foyer and bars are darkly lit  which allows privacy and peace which we enjoyed. The roof terrace is the best we found (we tried the Grand Central and Pulitzer too) with views of the city but very tranquil and again quite private. We have stayed at other good hotels in Barcelona on previous special occasions but this beats them all. The location is excellent too with great food options ( Tosca excellent tapas ) on the doorstep. ,5,2016,09,03
23,Great hotel in ideal location,This is our go-to hotel in Barcelona. The location is short walk from the Gothic quarter and la Ramblas and about a 15 minutes taxi ride from the airport. The hotel itself has a cool rooftop pool which is rare in central Barca. Staff are all very friendly and helpful,5,2016,09,02
23,"Just Right, Amazing Experience","Location is perfect, close to all touristic and local destinations and all sorts of transportation is either very close or nearby. 
The staff are super helpful and welcoming. 
Rooms are very clean and freshly scented. 
As honeymooners we felt pampered. 
Everything was excellent, i'll surely repeat my stay in OHLA.",5,2016,08,31
23,Fabulous!,"We stayed at this fabulous hotel during our honeymoon to Barcelona. We were greeted with champagne upon arrival, and every single staff member we interacted with was welcoming and friendly. The bed was comfortable and the shower was clean and spacious. The breakfast was fantastic, the view from the rooftop pool was amazing, and the best part is that the hotel is within walking distance to the Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas and the waterfront. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona and we will stay here again during our next visit.",5,2016,08,29
23,Our stay,"This is a lovely hotel, ideally located for sightseeing in the Gothic Quarter. Our room was spacious and comfortable, surprisingly quiet even though it looked out over the busy street outside our hotel.  The rooftop pool is small but ideal for a dip after a day wandering around the city.  Great cocktails too.  We had a lovely meal in the restaurant on our first night and after that, relied on recommendations from friends and the very helpful concierge at the hotel.  His recommendation ended up being our favourite restaurant of our stay.  We loved Barcelona and will definitely be back.",5,2016,08,28
23,Lovely relaxing  Hotel,"Our first time in Barcelona - we chose this hotel for it's central location and comforts.
After a lot of wonderful sightseeing and exploring around Barcelona the Ohla Hotel was like a cool and calm oasis just to rest and relax. It's so close to the Gothic Quarter with it's beautiful architecture and maze-like charm. The door/concierge staff were so helpful and welcoming each day - especially as we struggled with our Spanish. The rooftop pool is so relaxing with great views and the breakfasts were first class. The housekeeping staff were also great at making sure our rooms were perfect and kept clean and fresh.We would definitely come here again !",5,2016,08,25
23,Wonderful hotel in a beautiful and historic city,"We arrived before normal check in time at 1.30 to a friendly welcome, happily one room was ready which we used until the second room became available. The location is perfect for walking around the atmospheric streets including the Gothic quarter and Barcelona cathedral  literally just around the corner.
The hotel is lovely and cool inside, there is a dark marble staircase leading to the 6 floors and a couple of lifts which seem to have a mind of their own. If you forget to swipe your card inside the lift you seem to get taken to floor ""0.5"" which is the check in office, this caused some amusement, a bit like being sent to the headmasters office. Could be our imagination or a great security feature, but not a negative criticism.
There is a small pool on the roof (8th floor) which gives a panoramic view over the city, there is also a bar up there which serves food and drinks.
The staff are all extremely helpful and most speak good English, far better then our rudimentary Spanish. A quick mention for our cleaner who was lovely, and amazingly they usually clean the rooms twice a day.
You can catch a taxi right outside the hotel,  we went to the Sagrida Familia church for about 7 euros, make sure to book in advance as there are huge queues in blistering sun if you don't.
We were worried about the reputation of Las Ramblas and other areas being a pickpocket paradise but we didn't encounter any problems or even see any potential problems, there was a noticeable police presence and no hint of trouble despite the huge amount of people.
Breakfast is delicious with a huge range of cereals, fruit, traditional bacon/tomato/eggs and a nice cold meat selection, toast etc...that sentence doesn't really do it justice, it's very good indeed !  We didn't unfortunately try the restaurant(s) as we have two very fussy (pizza and chips) type children but the hotle food looked amazing. We ate out twice a day at the multitude of mostly reasonably priced restaurants and takeaways. We particularly enjoyed the paella in Nuria restauraunt at the top of las Ramblas.
My daughter informs me that the New York Times had the Ohla as one of the 50 best places in the world for cocktails, so if that's your thing then that's quite an accolade.
To summarise the combination of the hotel, its location and the city of Barcelona is a winning combination, highly recommended.",5,2016,08,25
23,Perfect ,What a lovely hotel for first time visit to Barcelona. Great location with some lovely food spots around and a nice wander down to waterfront. Wonderful sleep comfortable bed. great shower. And very quiet  room. We are on 6th floor. Check in was efficient we arrived early morning but managed to get our room by 1.30 and check in not till 3 pm. On arrival we were offered coffee and croissant in a lounge to side of concierge so we could sort ourselves out to hit the streets for a look around. Just what we needed after a long flight. Pool top area fabulous with lovely views. Thanks Ohla. A lovely hotel and friendly helpful staff. ,5,2016,08,23
23,Great hotel!,"We stayed at the Hotel the week after last for a three night break. The hotel is located in a great location with easy access to all the main sights. The rooms are very nice as is the roof bar and pool. Our room rate included 6 tapas from the hotel restaurant - whilst the presentation of the food was great, the food wasn't what we were looking for. If you like taster menus though, the restaurant food would I'm sure be right up your street. Having stayed in four 5 star hotels in Barcelona I'd rate this one as the best.",5,2016,08,22
23,Outrageous!,"We stayed at the Ohla Hotel for our last night in Barcelona, after travelling throughout Spain.  When we arrived we were greeted in such a professional manner by everyone that we encountered.  We arrived prior to check-in so our room was not ready.  Claudia, at check-in called housekeeping to get an estimate of the time, and we were told that it would be ready in an hour.  We were given a cold glass of cava, our luggage was taken from us and secured, and we were given options at the hotel where we could spend the time.  We chose the stunning rooftop lounge. We had delicious gazpacho and salmon served by a really professional and very pleasant gentleman originally from Milan under a shady canopy. 

In less than an hour our room was ready. Once in our room we found that our luggage had been delivered.  We were so pleased by the beautiful decor, comfortable bed and luxurious linens, big window, gorgeous shower, comfortable temperature and quietness despite our city view. The bath products smelled exotic, and the toiletries were generous and comprehensive. When we stepped out, toiletries and towels were replaced.

Because we had already seen the city, we only went to the cathedral, but the hotel's location is great...near La Rambla, Passeig de Garcia, a metro line, and lots of restaurants and shops. 

In the evening we went to the hotel bar for drinks.  My husband had an expertly prepared martini, whose presentation alone was worth the visit.  I enjoyed a Mediterranean Treasure, presented in a treasure chest with smoked herbs...unbelievable!  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant, which I almost never do, and I have to say that it was one of the best meals that we had in Spain, and we had great meals.  The pairings that we enjoyed in our tapas selections and the artistry with which it was prepared was a absolutely fantastic and an experience that I will remember for a long time.

As if all if this was not enough, the hotel packed a picnic breakfast for us to have at the airport because we had an early flight.  It was plentiful, delicious, and lasted throughout the day, which was great because our plane was delayed by 9+ hours!  Gotta love American Airlines!

You will not be disappointed by the Ohla Hotel.  It is fantastic!",5,2016,08,20
23,Amazing hotel!,"This hotel was amazing, just stayed for one night but wish we could have stayed longer. Very expensive though!
The glass shower in the middle of the room is a really cool feature.
And the pool is amazing overlooking the city.
The pool bar is pretty pricey for cocktails etc so we stuck to wine and beers.
Breakfast the next day was really yummy, they had lots of choice of both cooked and continental. 
The staff were really friendly and had our rooms ready a lot earlier than expected, one couple in our party of 6 also got a free upgrade to a suite which was a nice surprise!
Really central location and close to the gothic cathedral.",5,2016,08,20
23,Long weekend,"Booked a deluxe double via jet2 holidays as cheaper to do that than book flights and hotel separately. Stayed 3 nights and was not disappointed. Chose hotel for its location primarily and star rating - location is fantastic. There is a little street noise at night but we were on 5th floor so not a problem and is to be expected of central location.
Both reception and concierge really informative and helpful. Bed spacious - a superking I think - modern designed shower ( glass cube in room ) and cleverly concealed toilet. Breakfast ok - I don't do hot breakfast and if you do think it's limited choice but plenty of cold options. Roof top nice touch but pool small and beach not far away, good place for cocktails at night but v expensive - 15€ each - so didn't stay. Would return - has a good vibe throughout.",5,2016,08,14
23,A perfect stay,"This was a small but stylish hotel.
the junior suite was modern and super comfortable.
The breakfast was good enough.
The staff was extremely professional and nice. 
The pool was more like a pond, but it was better than nothing on hot summer afternoons.
The location was fabulous; in the beautiful gothic quarter, close to shopping, dining, areas and a ten minute walk to the pier. 

The housekeeping cleaned our rooms twice per day which was amazing and unseen for me. 

One issue I had was the gentleman with the white hair who was one of the concierge: he gave bad advice for restaurants. I think he had the restaurants best interest in mind, not the hotel guest!

But all together I enjoyed my stay and will definately return to this hotel.",5,2016,08,08
23,Lovely hotel but not quite 5 star,"I stayed at the Ohla Barcelona hotel with a girlfriend for 2 nights and thought that the boutique hotel was lovely. The staff were very helpful especially the concierge who gave us good recommendations for places to visit on limited time and bars/clubs in the evening. However the decor was a bit tired and the shower in the standard room had zero privacy. It was a little embarrassing as I was staying with a friend, they could have at least frosted the glass! Our room only had a small window with no view, and the toilet had no ventilation either. The breakfast though was great, there was a big selection of cakes, juices, meats and some cooked items too. The location was also fantastic with it being less than a 5 minute walk to the shops and then onto La Rambla. The pool was tiny although the view on the rooftop was gorgeous, only thing was that we didn't spot any sun loungers and only chairs! ",4,2016,08,08
23,roof bar,Tried the Grand Central Hotel roof bar.. but unable to get in . so they directed us to the Ohla Hotel a little further up the street .. we were not disappointed with this amazing roof bar which gave great views over the city and great cocktails.. great ambience and vibe .. will definitely return when I.m back in Barcelona,4,2016,08,08
23,Perfect!,"My wife and I stayed at the Ohla Hotel our first time in Barcelona and it was perfect for us. The location is amazing, within walking distance of so many sites and with easy access to multiple metro stations. There are several fantastic restaurants within a couple of blocks. The location also allowed us to walk around until quite late at night and never feel like we were in any danger. The hotel itself is a good mix of upscale and casual. It pulls off being a high end hotel without feeling stuffy at all. The room was a little on the small side, but very nice. The bed was extremely comfortable. The rooftop terrace is where it's at. The glass-walled pool is really cool and the views from the terrace are spectacular. We went all over Catalunya during our trip and we were very glad to have the Ohla Hotel to come home to each night. ",5,2016,08,07
23,"Nice hotel, great location ","We stopped of in Barcelona on our from Ibiza to Gran Canaria and checked into the Ohla Hotel. 
Was as we expected from our booking,  very contemporary,  modern and clean. 
Loved the open plan shower in the room and the staff checked every day to see if the room was OK and up to standard. 
The roof pool was fantastic , the walls are glass so a good opportunity to take a cool picture of you under water .
Room service was a little pricy and not much of it , we ordered 2 club sandwiches which cost us 34 euros , was very small and we didn't even get French fries with that :-(  so might be any idea so go out for dinner instead. 
The cocktail bar is award winning and definitely worth a look, I ordered a dry martini and it knocked my socks off!  
All in all was a good stay and I would come again next time we are in Barcelona ",5,2016,08,05
23,Incredible Hotel,"We stayed 3 days for the 30th birthday of my girlfriend in the junior suite, 
Already after booking you receive an incredible service. You can even choose which is the perfume you want to smell in the room or book a special bottle at your arrival time in the room. 
The room is modern, spacious, elegant, luxurious.. just incredible! 
The concierge service is just amazing as the service at the rooftop pool. Best hotel experience ever. Last but not least the location is perfect to discover the city center of Barcelona.",5,2016,08,05
23,Nice Hotel,"This is a nice hotel. Check-in was good. I really liked that for people arriving before check in they offer them a lounge to sit or access to the rooftop area. The room was nice. A little small, but very nice. Shower was great. The gym was a bit disappointing. I wish they would have had some heavier weights and maybe a couple weight machines. The rooftop pool was nice, but maybe a little smaller than I expected. Staff was helpful. Overall, it's a very nice hotel. ",5,2016,08,04
23,Good Hotel in Barcelona,"We enjoyed our stay at Ohla on a family vacation to Spain in July.  The highlights were:
1. Nice clean and quiet rooms
2. Good and reliable housekeeping service
3. Gorgeous rooftop pool with good cocktails served throughout the day - great view overlooking scenic Barcelona
4. Very high quality tapas restaurant and full service bar downstairs
5. Very close proximity to several great neighborhoods in Barcelona

Very few suggestions, except that check-in was a bit awkward - no one at the front entrance to take bags until we went searching for a porter and then have to go upstairs to a mezzanine office to check-in

Would consider going back",4,2016,08,02
23,"Nice, clean, excellent service","We stayed in Ohla Barcelona for 2 nights.
The communication for the booking was not perfect, but we looked forward to our stay.
We arrived early, so we were welcomed nicely by the concierge, but the room was not finished yet.
So we left our luggage and walked into the city.
After a short walk we returned and could check in at the reception.
Together with a nice drink the receptionist explained us the hotel facilities.
The rooms are spacious and very clean and bright.
A small point was that there was a shower in a bad instead if a separate shower, which we prefer.
There is an excellent cocktailbar on the groundfloor with brilliant cocktails, definately worth trying!
The restaurant is good as well, but not the best we had in Barcelona.
In the entire hotel all staff is very friendly and professional, and takes time for the guests.
Almost excellent, and definately worth a visit.",4,2016,08,01
23,Love Barcelona !,"Had an amazing 3 night stay at Ohla. Our room was lovely,  food was really good, staff were very helpful, we were made to feel really welcome. Excellent location and the rooftop bar and pool made it even more special. Highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a bit of luxury in the heart of Barcelona",4,2016,08,01
23,"Wonderful hotel, at the heart of it all","Very friendly and helpful staff - even before I arrived excellent communication about my stay, as well as a very warm welcome. The hotel is very centrally located, easily accessible to public transport options, and plenty of sights within walking distance. There is a beautiful rooftop bar (I recommend a glass of wine or cocktail at sunset) and the restaurant, Plassohla, serves truly delicious food. When I wanted to eat out, the concierge staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. 
The room was lovely - very modern, good amenities, clean and comfortable. 
I will definitely return to the Hotel Ohla.",5,2016,07,31
23,Great few days,"Fantastic hotel, adult only!!! Fantastic location just outside the Gothic quarter and its restaurants.
Staff extremely welcoming and helpful. Rooms spectacular.
Hotel is also on the Tourist bus route!

We've been here before and will return.",5,2016,07,31
23,Excellent food and service ,We had the pleasure of eating out here tonight and I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant. The food was both beautiful to look at and to eat. The tapas were very imaginative and nothing I had seen before. The feta and cherry gazpacho was the highlight. The service was friendly and helpful and the meal very reasonably priced. ,5,2016,07,30
23,Fantastic,Great position nice room good breakfast with a tapas resteraunt at night .fantastic roof garden with pool and bar overlooking the city close to the Gothic area and El born. Las ramblas great concierge to help with restaraunt  bookings and purchase tickets to various museums. Perfect place for a city break. ,5,2016,07,28
23,Love Hotel,"Great Hotel in Barcelona. Nice room, although a little small. Very comfortable Bed. 
The Rooftop bar and pool is great with nice views of the Cathedral.
Breakfast is very nice. A visit to the Cocktail bar is a nice way to start / end the evening.",5,2016,07,26
23,Winter time stay at Hotel Ohla,"We spent three nights at this nice hotel in December 2015 in the days leading up to Christmas.  The room was furnished adequately and overlooked the gothic area.  It was quiet and we slept well throughout our stay. 

The quirky shower was in the middle of the room, some frosted glass would have been appreciated to add a bit of privacy but I guess it was a feature. The bathroom sinks were behind the shower on the wall and the toilet was completely separate and hidden away behind wooden panelling. Unfortunately, the shower leaked twice as there was a water drainage problem.  The second time was so bad that the water flowed to the room entrance door but we called Reception and they sorted it out.  There was a bad sewerage smell in the corridor at the time of our stay but it didn’t enter our room.

My partner was celebrating a special birthday whilst there and I paid the hotel to provide a birthday cake and balloons which were both lovely and much appreciated. We loved the roof top garden, the sights were amazing both during the day and at night.  It was winter time so we didn’t try the modern looking swimming pool that resembled a huge glass tank.

Breakfast was delicious and we loved the dining room which was just off the main street.  Concierge was very helpful and also gave us a street map.  The hotel is in an excellent location and we walked everywhere, including the Port. There is also a small supermarket directly opposite the hotel.

Barcelona was extremely busy as it was Christmas time, every street was crammed with people who appeared to be visiting tourists rather than locals buying last minute Christmas presents. The very pretty and traditional Christmas markets were very popular. A must when visiting Barcelona is taking one of the hop on and hop off city bus tours as recommended by Concierge.  We really enjoyed it .

We’d definitely go back to this hotel but would perhaps look for a room with a different type of bathroom. Thank you for a memorable stay Hotel Ohla!",4,2016,07,25
23,Quick weekend getaway ,Have to say I think this is on of the nicest hotels in Barcelona. Nothing is to much trouble for the staff and the bedrooms are lovely. The panoramic showers do get a bit of getting used to and are definitely not for the shy but go on give them a try. The food is to die for and breakfast can be what ever you want although the standard buffet style is plenty. Also a visit to the rooftop swimming pool is something not to be missed.,5,2016,07,23
23,"Great hotel, Perfect City Location","My husband, one year son and I stayed at this hotel in July, 2016. We had a great experience here. The staff was very nice, and concierge was helpful in directing us to good restaurants and sight seeing. This hotel is very walkable. Great rooftop pool. Would totally stay here again. Great modern style hotel. Highly recommend Ohla.",5,2016,07,22
23,Nice and cozy hotel in central location,"We stayed 6 nights at Ohla Barcelona in July 2016. We choose the hotel after reading positive reviews about it and because it has a beautiful rooftop bar eith a pool. It's a quite small boutique hotel, which is good because we try to avoid big and busy touristic ""entertainment centres"". The hotel is stylish and clean. Our room was a junior suite deluxe on the second floor. The room itself was amazing! It was all one big space,  except toilet and shower. We had a bath tub with a view! The only con was the traffic noice that bothered me during some nights.

The hotel has an experience department which contacted us before our arrival and asked our preferences about pillows, frangrance of the sheets etc. I've never experienced anything like that before! 

The reason why I didn't rate this a 5 star hotel is the staff. Some are really friendly and nice but some not so much. As I've travelled a lot and stayed at many 5 star hotel, I've seen better service and I expect to get excellent service when paying big amount of money.

",4,2016,07,21
23,Great 5* in Barrio Gótico,"This 5* on via Laietana is a good bet in Barcelona. Laietana is terribly noisy and, my personal POV, not very nice, but the rooms are very silent and perfectly AC'd. The design is ""modern Catalan"", very tasteful if you like sleak and modern. 
Only hick-up, the bathroom is partially open, and the shower stands in the middle of the room in smaller rooms, if you are travelling with your mama and did not grow up in a naked house I would stay away from those.
Service is great (good Concierge), buffet breakfast is a treat, the rooftop pool is just enough and the service up there is good. Nothing to say. Turn down service always well done. Gym is OK...
It's a shame that, for lack of space, I feel the hotel misses a good lobby, like a nice grand lobby, which you usually find in 5* in Barcelona.
To summarize, way more positive things than negative, the hotel is a good bet if you like to stay closer to the sea, probably my fave amongst all the hotels I tried in BCN, and I tried a few. I would recommend it.",4,2016,07,20
23,Great location,"Great hotel, with luxury rooms, and the perfect location. Situated on the edge of the Gothic Quarter this is the perfect location for walking the old town of Barcelona. The hotel is a little dark, but the rooms are comfortable with modern amenities and decent space. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",4,2016,07,20
23,Well worth the money,"The Ohla is a fantastic place to stay when visiting Barcelona. The staff is professional, attentive and exceptionally friendly. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a glass of Cava and our bags were immediately taken off our hands and stored. We were then offered the opportunity to use the onsite facilities at our leisure. During the course of our stay, we requested a number of things to the room (ice, cocktail glasses, etc.) and they delivered them promptly and always with a smile. 

The rooms are modern, elegant and comfortable. They are constantly cleaned and kept in order. We left multiple times a day and, upon return, the room was almost always cleaned and organized. We stayed in a junior suite, for reference.

I will definitely go out of my way to stay here again the next time I return to Barcelona, as the hotel is in a great location, works hard for its guests and facilitates the relaxation one seeks on vacation.",5,2016,07,20
23,Beautiful boutique hotel.,"One of the best boutique hotels I had the pleasure of staying in.
The price is a bit high, but totaly worth it when you are welcomed the best way all throughout your stay.
True five star hotel, services and staff.
Will be back soon!",4,2016,07,15
23,Beautiful boutique hotel in excellent location,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay in this lovely boutique hotel. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and immaculately clean, the location couldn't be better , right by the Barri Gotic and just opposite a metro station. The highlight was the rooftop bool and bar, with stunning views to the Cathedral and even down to the sea. We used it every afternoon to escape the city heat and then felt rejuvenated to go out again in the evening. I would definitely return for another Barcelona break.",5,2016,07,13
23,Fantastic Hotel,"Loved staying in this boutique hotel.  From the time we checked in, we were offered a seat and champange.  The experience was awesome, the concierges were EXTREMELY helpful and pleasant to assist in any questions or recommendations we had during our stay.  LOVED the roof top terrace-the view was breath taking.  Central location to many places we wanted to visit and with in walking distance to so much!! Definitely will return to stay at this hotel if given the opportunity to travel to Barcelona again.",5,2016,07,12
23,Nice boutique hotel.,Love the feel of the hotel.  Selected it for its location and pool.  Location is perfect and everything is accessible.  The pool is on the rooftop and the seating and bar is fantastic.  The view is phenomenal but the pool is so small and it is the central focus of the bar and seating; could not enjoy a light workout as poo is too small.  The rooms were incredible and the staff was so accommodating!,4,2016,07,11
23,Cool hotel in excellent central location,"Ohla is a cool, stylish boutique"" hotel in a converted department store in a great, central location for Gotic, Ramlas, beach etc. Great roof bar, sun deck and plunge pool with nice cocktails. Junior suite room was spacious. Windows don't open though. Recommended",4,2016,07,11
23,Just in Between,"I can't say I'm impressed but I can't say it was unpleasant either. The location is good. The breakfast is good. The rooms are modern but transparent showers? May not be ok for everyone. We were ok with that tho. The terrace is nice with a pool. The size of the pool actually fits for a house rather than a hotel. All the setting seemed to me that they really tried hard to stand tall among others. One thing to criticize is that the hotel is not environment friendly, in my opinion. They put many letters to the rooms, every day, which some of us may consider a nice touch. In the end we all throw them away. We requested late check-out, and it was confirmed at our arrival. But then they left a ""letter"" to our room during our last day reminding the standard check-out time. We needed to confirm with the gentleman at the reception on our check-out day, and he responded that they do not confirm late check-outs at arrival but he will make an exception for us. The approach didn't feel sincere and handling could be better. These may not seem to qualify for giving an average rating but I could just not smell the spirit of a ""boutique hotel"".",3,2016,07,11
23,Wonderful hotel!!!,"Cool boutique hotel on a main street, ten minutes' walk from the harbour, and next to the cathedral. Very personal service, and the tapas bar on the ground floor is adventurous and high quality. The hotel staff are hugely polite and helpful. We booked the best available room, and were upgraded to a stunning suite the size of an apartment! The glass-sided rooftop plunge pool looks out over the city, and features a bar and 'chill out' cabanas. It's stunning. Buffet breakfast was perfect - everything was of the highest quality. I can't recommend the hotel highly enough, and Barcelona is an amazing city, with Gaudi, harbour, shopping and beaches!",5,2016,07,09
23,Mother and daughter break in Barcelona,"Hotel Ohla Barcelona was the perfect place for us. Located so as to be able to walk everywhere - old town, beach, Gaudi parc, Olympic park, cathedrals. Lots of great restaurants nearby. Lovely rooftop pool and space and well presented breakfast. Room was comfortable although the lack of a door on the bathroom area caused some consternation! Concierge staff were really helpful booking tickets.",5,2016,07,07
23,Amazing hotel at the heart of Barcelona,"We have stayed at this hotel for 2 consecutive years and it really does deliver.  The hotel staff are all incredibly friendly, and the rooms are fun!  The standard rooms have a glass box shower in the middle of the room so may put of some - but sums up the fun of the hotel.  The location is excellent, near the cathedral and a quick taxi ride to anywhere of interest.  Or you can take a 10-15 minute stroll down to Barcelona beach.  There are lots of local restaurants near to the hotel, and a small supermarket directly opposite for snacks and treats!  You are greeted at reception with a glass of cava and the hospitality continues throughout your stay.  Breakfast is a must and is very good - mix of pastries, cooked eggs, bacon and sausages, cereals, fresh fruit, cheese and hams, yogurts - where do I end.  And all with complimentary chilled Cava.  There is a roof top plunge pool with amazing views across the city.  We recommend you get your own taxi directly outside the hotel otherwise the taxi charge you a waiting fee.  We will definitely return to this hotel",5,2016,07,05
23,Good location,We stayed for 4 nights and were pleased with the hotel. It is close to tourist bus stop and walking distance to good restaurants and La Rambla. The room was nice but was spilt level meaning that the bathroom is upstairs and the shower is in the centre if the room which is visible from everywhere in the room. The toilet is separated with walls and a door. Overall good. Breakfast was underwhelming. No real highlights but our stay was pleasant.,4,2016,07,05
23,Very good hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend, visiting Barcelona for a concert. Hotel Ohla is in a great location close to the gothic quarter. Sightseeing and shopping all within a short stroll, and the beach no more than 20 mins walk. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and made use of the sun deck. Rooms were of a high standard and I would definitely return.",4,2016,07,05
23,Just perfect!,"I loved everything about our stay here! The location is great, the staff was super friendly, the hotel rooms were spacious and super clean! We haven't tried the hotel's restaurant as there are many great locations for dinner in the vicinity, but the breakfast buffet was delicious! And last but not least, the rooftop terrace and pool! Just perfect!",5,2016,07,04
23,Great hotel - rooftop pool is lovely ,"The rooftop pool and view was beautiful and really set this hotel apart from others. Best possible way to laze away the afternoon. 

Clean, modern design throughout. Staff was attentive and helpful. The location was convenient for sight seeing and quite a few highly rated restaurants were very close by. 

Would stay again! ",5,2016,07,03
23,1st Class Experience,"From the moment we arrived, the staff of the Ohla treated us as if we were their personal guests. The amenities were fantastic and the location in the city is great. You can walk to many sites or take a short cab ride to anywhere in the city! For active travelers, ask about a guided running your with a local trainer. It was a great way to see the city and an excellent workout! One negative was that we arrived early and we couldn't checkin until 3. It would have been nice to have a place to freshen up besides the bar after a long flight, but that is a small complaint.",5,2016,07,02
23,An oasis in BCN,"We arrived early and they gave us the suite before check in! The service is friendly and kind of family!!! The hotel is small, full of luxury details and the pool is just perfect!!!!
Amenities are outstanding, and the location is just to good to be true!!!",5,2016,07,02
23,Great Stay,"Excellent location right in the heart of the city, very pleasant and helpful staff.  Would definitely stay there again.  Beautiful views from the rooftop and swimming pool.  Food was excellent as well.  No complaints!",5,2016,07,01
23,Excellent Location,"Lovely hotel and we had a very warm welcome and the roof top pool has spectacular views.  Sadly the rooms were not ready when we arrived despite the hotel contacting us asking for our arrival time prior to arrival, 3 hours later one of the room was still not ready.  Having provided tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms we were surprised that they charged 2 Euros for a single sachet of coffee, for a hotel that charges 5 Star prices I would expect this for free.",4,2016,07,01
23,Beautiful Hotel with excellent location,"We enjoyed our stay at Ohla and could tell that they are working very hard to make sure their guests have a positive experience. My adapter would not fit the outlets and they had some they let us use. Most European hotels have wimpy hairdryers and the hairdryer in the room was excellent. Shower had great water pressure. The rooms are modern and clean. Our room had a toilet in a small room with a door and whatever they use to keep the water clean had a bad smell. I was not as impressed with the concierge service. We asked for a reccommendation for a nice restaurant (explained that we are foodies so did not want to go to a cheesy tourist trap place). Sent us to Patron which was about a $8 cab ride from the hotel. There was live entertainment and we had a great table but the food was horrible and it was filled with tourists. Worst meal we had in Barcelona...But we are foodies so I may be more critical than others with the recommendation. 
The rooftop pool and bar is amazing and the service was excellent. We spent a wonderful afternoon sitting on the couches soaking up the sun and drinking Cava. Many great tapas bars near the Picasso museum. Nice neighborhood and plenty of locals. Try the bombo, it is a meatball covered in mashed potato, fried and topped with a mayo based sauce that is delicious. The bar at Ohla has award winning cocktails!! We tried a couple and they were all AMAZING! We tried the breakfast/brunch the last day and it was very good. There is a Starbucks next door from the hotel. Overall, great stay at the hotel.",4,2016,06,26
23,everything was excellent!,"Great hotel with beautiful rooms at a fantastic location!
The staff will do everything to make your stay unforgettable.
The corner rooms are spacious and have much sunlight.
You can reach all the major sights in Barcelona on foot.

23,Modern Boutique Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"
The biggest asset to the OHLA Hotel is the rooftop bar and pool which has spectacular views over the city towards the Cathedral.

We spent our evenings on the roof top, after dinner in the cool breeze enjoying a glass of wine.

The La Phassohla gastronomic and tapas bar located in the hotel had a sophisticated feel and unique range of tapas with the freshest ingredients with a complimentary wine list. 
We chose to dine in La Phassohla for two of our three evenings in Barcelona. On both occasions the service was outstanding.

The rooms are modern, fresh and luxurious, well maintained and our room 612 was very quiet.

The concierge offered outstanding personalized service, they booked our tickets for the Sagrada Familia on line, and gave good recommendations in terms of restaurants and daily sight seeing activities.

We highly recommend the OHLA hotel and look forward to returning.

23,Great roof top views and accommodating concierge,The hotel was centrally located which we loved.  We were able to walk or get the metro pretty quickly.  The concierge was very accommodating and was very happy to help.  Jorge gave us some great recommendations as well.  We would definitely return to his hotel when we come back to Barcelona.,5,2016,06,22
23,You need to love the colour black!,"My room was beautiful, spotlessly clean with a lovely bathroom. What really upset me was the black walls in the corridors, black carpet and black doors. The lift was very
difficult to see as that was all black as well with bad lighting. Thankfully the bedding was
top quality and white!!",3,2016,06,22
23,A very special hotel in a very special city! ,"What to say about this hotel? 
First off it's by far the most wonderful hotel we've stayed in. Everything about the place is classy, contemporary and understated. From the moment you arrive the staff cannot do enough to enhance your experience of Barcelona. 
The hotel itself is incredible. 
The room we stayed in was comfortable, extremely clean and very cool (we loved the shower in the middle of the room, superb).
The restaurant and the food they served was exquisite (I recommend the steak tar-tar with mustard ice-cream, who knew!!).
Finally the staff. They were incredibly professional and efficient whilst at the same time being very warm and made us feel very welcome. 
I cannot recommend the Ohla highly enough and cannot wait until I have the privilege of staying there again and spending more time in that incredible city! ",5,2016,06,20
23,Best place to explore this amazing town!,"Every time I go to Barcelona I try to stay here.
I'm not a fan of chilling at the  Barcelona's beach,better to walk through the small streets and to visit some tapas!
The hotel is in a center,but i'd say its pretty quite.
The rooftop terrace with a nice view from the pool - is great to stay after walking around and hard shopping hours!
The bar at the first floor - is a must for every evening!One of the best bars in the world,and great drinks!
100% comeback
cheers

23,Decent hotel stay but not really 5 star quality,"Overall, the Ohla experience was marginally “acceptable” based on my hotel experience of 5 star hotels.  It unfortunately didn’t delight or exceed my expectations as I had hoped having chosen a 5 star hotel for our anniversary vacation.  
Here were some of the noted observations:
Good:
•	Always someone in attendance at the concierge reception deck
•	The concierge team was very responsive and attentive to our needs
•	Very close to everything – loved the location
•	We were given a bottle of cava on the first day to celebrate our anniversary – that was much appreciated and a very nice surprise
•	The drinks were exceptional - this was a highlight of our stay
Negatives:
•	The waiting lobby is left unattended in the morning and there were quite a few dirty cups and glasses left on table.  There should also be someone there to assist / clean up.  
•	The waiting lobby is also a bit dirty, there is visible wear and tear on the red chairs and appears in need of a deep cleaning
•	Our room had an obvious soil / white stain on the rug – just left a bad impression.  We did not call down to complain – but something that made me hesitate on the cleanliness of the room
•	We dined one evening early to catch a show.  The staff was not very well informed – we asked about the wines and he had no idea.  The food took a long time to be served as well.  The food was very good, however and we ended up dining again the last evening at the bar due to the food and the service was better because we had the bartender attend to our food.
•	We tried the Jazz night on Sunday and was disappointed how crowded it was (due to it being open to the public).   They should have allotted time for a private reception for hotel guests.",3,2016,06,14
23,Perfect Location and Great Service,"We stayed here for a long weekend as a couple. The hotel service was wonderful, all the concierge were full of amazing recommendations. The rooms were clean and nicely designed. We didn't try the restaurants because of so many other options around. The local is perfect, right in Gothic Quarter and walking distance to Born with all of its bars and restaurants, and Catedral Barcelona. You can also walk to Marina. Cabs were a bit hard to catch but we walked everywhere. The rooftop was amazing - the view and the bar and scene were just wonderful. Had an amazing time. Can't wait to come back!",5,2016,06,14
23,"Great Hotel, great staff, great location","Really friendly knowledgable staff, hotel is situated within walking distance of all the central sites and areas of interest. The roof top bar and pool adds to the ambience and the great cocktail lounge is a must.",5,2016,06,13
23,Great hotel and wonderful location.,"Hotel is central to everything, very clean and beautiful.  Beds were so comfortable. 

For anyone who is shy just a heads up the shower is in the middle of the room with glass walls. 

Pool on the roof is a great place to go in the evening, take a bottle of wine and enjoy the beautiful views of Barcelona.",5,2016,06,11
23,Lovely hotel and great staff,"The hotel is centrally located with great staff who were very helpful. It has interesting art on the outside of the building - giant eyeballs! We walked almost everywhere from the hotel. There is also a metro just across from the street, so very well connected. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2016,06,11
23,"Beautiful, comfortable decor.  Outstanding customer service.","Beautiful, comfortable decor.  Outstanding customer service.  The open deck pool/bar area is very impressive with clear pool walls and an incredible view of the city.  The staff are super accommodating.  Our room was super clean and comfortable.  Worth every penny!!!!",5,2016,06,10
23,Amazing location,We were treated like royalty. All the staff was so attentive. The concierge was very informative. The breakfast was awesome with a lot of variety. The room very clean (not very large) and the beds so comfortable. The Gothic location could not have been better.  I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. Oh the rooftop was fabulous!,5,2016,06,09
23,Great hotel in central Barcelona!,"I stayed at the Ohla Hotel in Barcelona for 3 nights and had a wonderful stay. The staff were very helpful, the location was central and easily walkable to plenty of sights as well as local metro stations. The rooftop pool and bar was gorgeous and we spent a few hours one afternoon sunning ourselves with the view across Barcelona. 

The only negative was the open plan bathroom (toilet was separate) with a glass shower cubicle. As I was travelling with my sister this gave me very little privacy and made showering a funny experience but we managed OK and I still wouldn't hesitate to return again.",5,2016,06,09
23,What a spot!!,"Loved this hotel. So different !  Small property but in the middle of everything in Barcelona. Shopping, restaurants and jump on - jump off tourist bus route.  Walking distance to a lot of attractions. Small pool and bar on the top floor with great views! Would return!",4,2016,06,08
23,Superb,"Excellent service, decent rooms with very comfortable beds/sheets/pillows,  great location, outstanding restaurant, beautiful rooftop pool bar, lovely design and decor, hugely impressed and difficult to find any fault with this hotel. Highly recommend.",5,2016,06,07
23,Great boutique hotel centrally located,"We spent three nights at the Ohla hotel and really enjoyed our stay.  The rooms and bathrooms are clean and modern and the staff was extremely helpful.  One of the best features of the hotel is the amazing rooftop pool with plenty of loungers and cabanas. The hotel is also very centrally located, just off las Ramblas and close to many restaurants and bars. The only downfall was that we paid for a delux room and ended up having a room with no view at all that looked out onto another room.  Make sure to ask for a room facing the street if you are paying for a delux room. We would definitely stay here again and have already recommended the hotel to family that are going to Barcelona in a few weeks.",5,2016,06,06
23,Quality hotel in a great location,"We booked a junior suite so that my daughter could be in the room with us and also requested a quiet room. Our room was on the sixth floor and we heard no noise at all.
We found the breakfasts offered everything you could want - if you couldn't see it on offer, you only had to ask for it! The lady in the restaurant at breakfast was efficient and friendly.
The concierge service was superb offering recommendations and advise and making reservations etc. Without exception ALL concierge staff were excellent.

Thank you to all staff at the Ohla Hotel",5,2016,06,06
23,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I stayed at the Ohla Barcelona hotel after arriving on a cruise ship.   Every part of the stay was fantastic.  First, I think it important that you know that we have high standards, being used to staying in nice places.  This hotel fit the bill in every regard.  The room was modern, clean and comfortable.  The service was attentive, friendly and helpful in every regard.  The hotel is located in a great location allowing us to walk to the gothic area and La Rambla and restaurants and shopping.  If you stay here, make sure you have a drink at the rooftop pool bar and enjoy the fabulous view.",5,2016,06,05
23,Great terrace bar ,"Very attentive staff, stylish rooms although still not convinced about glass shower in middle of room! Great location for site seeing, bars and restaurants and shopping
Best feature at any time of day/night is the terrace bar with rooftop pool. Would certainly recommend.",5,2016,06,05
23,Vacation week at Ohla,"The entire staff excelled in their respective roles.They made our stay truly memorable. My companion required accessible accommodations; we were very comfortable in our room and the staff assisted him in every way possible. The rooftop lounge was a delightful place to spend time away from visiting Barcelona's sights. With regret, we had to end our visit.",5,2016,06,03
23,Wonderful Honeymoon Stay,"We highly recommend Ohla Hotel. The location is just perfect (and I recommend the Gothic Quarter in general opposed to staying on La Rambla. You are still close enough to walk a few minutes to all the shopping and touristy things but have the benefit of amazing local food and amazing winding roads full of character opposed to how touristy La Rambla is.) My husband and I stayed at the Ohla Thursday- Monday during our honeymoon in a junior suite deluxe and the room was exactly what the website made it out to be, and more. Incredibly spacious with wonderful amenities! The only minor disappointment is that none of the beautiful windows in the suite opened (all sealed, perhaps for safety). We would have enjoyed the fresh air and taking in the vibrant city below. We did not find it to be noisy at all though, which was nice. And for a suite in such a prime location, while expensive, it was really very good value. The staff were all very sincerely pleasant and we received very quick action when we requested little things- i.e. an ice bucket. We did ask for a recommendation for dinner/snacks where we could also watch the notable Barcelona vs. Sevilla game on Sunday night but the concierge on duty did not have a recommendation/ did not know where we could watch, which was rather disappointing. But we walked around and eventually found a spot in the Gothic quarter, so not that big of a deal. The rooftop pool deck was lovely for a drink and to layout and relax and generally very peaceful. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was very good, as well. There were very few children at the hotel, which was nice, too.
This was our second trip to Barcelona this year and while we stayed at one of the H10 properties on our prior stay and had a nice enough experience, the Ohla will now definitely be our go-to for many future trips back to amazing Barcelona!",5,2016,06,03
23,"Perfect location, great hotel","We had a great stay at the Ohla, as the first stop for our Honeymoon. The staff were extremely helpful, and the hotel is in a great location for exploring Barcelona by foot. Easy walk to Passeig de Gracia, the beach, Gothic Quarter, and Montjuic (a bit further). The rooms, while not particularly large, were well kept and comfortable. The included breakfast buffet was excellent, as was our dinner in the restaurant one night. The view from the rooftop terrace is fantastic as well, though it was still a little early in the year to swim in the pool. Definitely recommend staying here. Side note: given our shower was in the middle of the room and enclosed in glass, may not be appropriate for families (though they may have differently designed rooms).",5,2016,06,01
23,Luxury,"Fantastic experience. Had a junior suite and booked a chill out booth beside the rooftop pool to propose to my girlfriend. How could she not say yes?

Expensive but worth a treat. Great central location too.",5,2016,05,31
23,"Great location, fantastic roof top bar","The location of the Ohla is great!  Centrally located and within in walking distance to most things or a short walk to the subway.

Our rooms did not face the street so they were very quiet and nicely done.

The roof top bar is great with fantastic views over the city.

My only complaint was the breakfast. Online in advance the hotel wanted 29€ per day. In the hotel is was quoted for 20€.  But it was not worth even that.  Give that we paid over 200 € per night the breakfast should be included free.

We only ate in the hotel once, and then decided to go to a nearby cafe. It was just as good and only cost €10 per person.#

Also the hotel wrote in advance offering over priced hotel transfers and a fee to reserve the seats on the roof top bar.  A taix cost less than half and we never had a problem getting seats at the bar.",5,2016,05,28
23,A Welcome Relaxation,"It was so nice to find a welcoming hotel in the middle of busy Barcelona in the rain with no booking!
It was as a relaxing, laid back oasis. The staff was lovely, we were welcomed with a nice glass of cava, they had the comfiest bed and a fantastic roof area.",5,2016,05,26
23,Nice but expected more for our money,"We stayed here during the F1 weekend so the city was busy and great fun. The hotel is very well located and on arrival the main guy in reception was brilliant. Gave us a glass of champagne and offered to sort out tickets for all sorts of things. Considering the price we paid the room was disappointingly bland, very little furniture or decor, no view just of a dark street and after the first morning we had the milk was never replaced. I should have mentioned it but instead and then got annoyed every morning. The roof terrace is nice but the pool is far too small to actually do anything and although it look nice being clear glass I think it put anyone off going in.... Breakfast was nice enough but I wouldn't pay that price again for that hotel when there are so many other hotels to choose from.",3,2016,05,26
23,Fantastic weekend break,"The Ohla Hotel was a great base for our weekend break to Barcelona - stylish rooms, a fantastic rooftop pool, truly helpful staff (especially the very knowledgeable concierge team), and a welcoming atmosphere - simply a great place to stay in an incredible city.",5,2016,05,23
23,Couldn't find a better location,"Steps from the gothic quarter, 15 min from beach and Les Ramblas with the Opera house right across the street. - bed linens were wonderful, staff very accommodating, roof top deck with pool and bar was amazing and tapas in the restaurant among the best we had in Barcelona.

Room was decent size by european city standards - the full glass shower in middle of room was a bit off putting but worked fine.  No need to worry about a street side room as sound proofing was great - we were not even aware of traffic.  The Tapas really were superb and the buffet breakfast was simple but well done - actually the best American style bacon we found through out our travels.

Elevators could be slow and the stairs so dark we used them once and for safety reasons did not use again.  Halls were dark too but room lighting was fine.  Wifi was fast. The accommodating staff and comfortable beds and friendly atmosphere in the bar would make this a hotel I would consider again.  Pricey but good - especially for women traveling alone.",4,2016,05,22
23,Central location,"Great central location 10 minutes to Les Ramblas and to beach. Great night sleep, despite having a street view we were pleasantly surprised that we were not woken by any noise.
Our room rate did not include breakfast. We did use the hotel bar, which also served tapas.
Fab roof top terrace which had great views, unfortunately bar not open, a missed opportunity. Small pool not warm enough to use during our stay.",4,2016,05,21
23,Amazing Service. Fantastic Hotel. Luxury Suite,"Visited this hotel with my husband and 2 children for a few days in May. We booked a suite for the extra room and we certainly got it. It was a very modern room with a very unusual shower/bath concept. Open plan. I loved the idea, it worked well for us, but probably worth knowing prior to arrival.

The service at this hotel was second to none. From being greeted by concierge and taken personally to reception, to being greeted with Cava whilst booking in what a great start. We arrived at 11am fully aware that we may not be able to check in. We were advised to take a seat at the rooftop pool and have a look around and we would be taken to our room in around 10 minutes. I couldn't have asked for more. 

This Hotel was an amazing experience and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.  
",5,2016,05,19
23,Nice location but far from five stars,"We booked this hotel  because of  location, the room description 28m2, de luxe and the star rating. We paid a lot, and expected a reasonable value for money.
We got location, a room that was not deluxe and roughly 25 m2, 15 of  them taken by a dark bathroom and a shower placed right in the middle of the room.
Just one chair to sit on, otherwise the bed as the natural choive for sitting down.
We do not blme the hotel for the weather, but with bad weather you spend more time in your room and realize how poorly designed the interior and the lighting is.
Not worth the price and definitely no five stars.",3,2016,05,19
23,Muy bien....,We had a fantastic stay at the Ohla Hotel...stayed 3 nights and had a brilliant time. Have recommended the hotel to friends and family. My only slight niggle is I would have preferred a door from the room to the bathroom for some privacy. Wouldn't put me off staying again though,5,2016,05,17
23,"Difficult to fault, but questionable value","We were treated to three nights here by a family member who had chosen Barcelona to celebrate a milestone birthday.
It's actually difficult to fault the hotel. Ideal location, brilliant staff, nicely appointed rooms (albeit with an interesting shower arrangement) and (if being picky) the only negative would be that the corridors and stairs are very dark and gloomy. 
But as part of our trip, we also stayed at two more modest establishments - each was priced at 20% of the cost of the Ohla. 
In other words; one night here was equal to five elsewhere. Furthermore, the breakfast offered by the other two was better than the breakfast here!
Although we enjoyed our brief stay at the Ohla, it was difficult to see how the extra cost could be justified.",4,2016,05,16
23,"Perfect location, perfect service","We just came back from a long weekend at Ohla, travelling with two other couples. The Ohla Hotel is lovely, which is in no small part down to the staff, who greeted us with a genuinely warm welcome and were always ready to help. In terms of location, the hotel's right on the doorstep of many of the top attractions, not to mention bars and restaurants. We found ample eating/drinking options within just a few minutes' walk. Sadly, we had mixed weather on our visit, but still managed to make it up to the roof terrace, and I'm so glad we did. 

The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is the slightly odd room design, with the shower right in the middle. That's not the problem, per se, just that if a guest happened to be in the shower when the room door was opened, anyone walking by would get an eyeful. It's a shame, since our room - a mid-size - was plenty big enough for a stunning wet room. 

That said, I'd definitely recommend the Ohla. And next time I'd remind my hubby not to open the room door whenever I was in the shower.",4,2016,05,16
23,This has got to be the best hotel in Barcelona,"Just got back from a lovely 4 day break in Barcelona staying at the Ohla. 
Recommended by a friend who lives in the city we couldn't have asked for a better hotel. Great location in the middle of everything on the edge of the Gothic quarter.
The staff were a real hi-lite, really keen to help and the concierge had some great recommendations for places to eat. The roof terrace is sublime and never busy, pool a bit nippy.
We were in 702, one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, a huge two level room with B&O tellies and sound systems and 18ft windows overlooking the street. Surprisingly quiet as well.
Apart from the hotel the hi-lite of the stay was the motorbike and sidecar tour of the city with Brightside, 4 hours on a Ural motorbike with a great guide and we saw everything, set us up for the rest of our stay.
Thank you Ohla and your staff and a special thank you for the room upgrade!
Mark",5,2016,05,14
23,"Great Hotel, Great Location ","We stayed with two other couples for a long weekend, this has a great location for exploring the City and a 20 minute walk from the harbour. Walking distance from some of the best places you can eat and drink plus close to tourism and shops if that takes your fancy.

The Restaurant and Bar are stunning, remember this is boutique so is expensive but worth it. A great feature is the pool and terrace on the roof which allows you to see this great city from a Birdseye view.

I preferred this location to the W!",5,2016,05,11
23,Barcelona Jewel of the Mediterranean ,"I have a progressive neuropathy and have not been back to Europe for several years. My companion found a travel service for people with disabilities,SAGE, and they booked us in this wonderful hotel. They were very attentive & accommodating to my needs and made sure we were comfortable in every way. It is truly a five star hotel experience for all....The staff are like instant family. This was the nicest hotel stay we have ever had and I can't wait until we return to this hotel and this beautiful, exceedingly friendly city and much of this feeling is because of this hotel and it's staff.",5,2016,05,09
23,"A small, quiet Hotel","Terrific location in the old city that my wife and I enjoyed very much. It has a closed in area for breakfast w/ gr8 coffee and rolls, etc., that's a bar at night. Bus stop is right outside, the Cathedral/Museum (not the Basillica) is a short walk away, and the city market is also. Souvenir shopping is right outside in a pedestrian walkway. 
Will definitely stay here again. Appearance is unique to the Medieval surroundings!!!",5,2016,05,07
23,One of the best hotel experiences EVER,"My recent stay at the Hotel Ohla in Barcelona was without exception one of the best and most personable hotel experiences I have had. The my standard hotel room was fully appointed with a wonderful view, very comfortable bed and rain shower.  The attention to detail in the decor, lighting and especially the amazing service. The concierge Daniele and his colleagues where extremely helpful and very welcoming and personal (not like many concierges in European hotels- they are so stiff). I was on a solo visit and Daniele made wonderful recommendations for restaurants to visit that are welcoming to solo diners. When I revisit Barcelona I will only stay at this magnificent hotel!",5,2016,05,06
23,Great Hotel Worthy of 5 Stars,"We loved the room cleanliness and spaciousness.  The staff was always friendly and helpful.  The food in the restaurant was great!  
The only complaint was the firmness of the mattress.
We would definitely stay at the Ohla again.  

Read my more complete review on Expedia.",5,2016,05,03
23,City centre perfection!,"Stayed here for a long weekend with my boyfriend in a standard room with breakfast. Room was perfect size and bathroom was great! Loved the hospitality of the staff, always so friendly. Rooftop pool was a great place to relax when the sun came out or for a drink before dinner. Only negative would be the variety of breakfast for the extra cost - I think there could be more hot options for the price you do pay. Other than that was great!",5,2016,05,02
23,"Great location, hospitality and convenience ","The location of the hotel was great! Just a walk away from the major attractions and places of interest.

The rooms were really interesting and functional.

The staff were absolutely friendly and especially the team at the concierge had given us good recommendations on where to go and dine at. 

Love the proximity of hotel to the many locations as we could walk back to the hotel to rest/ put our things before heading out again.
",4,2016,04,27
23,All around awesome!,"Our daughter was studying abroad in Barcelona and booked the hotel for our visit.  The location was perfect; the staff amazing; the rooftop bar/pool, stunning, and the restaurant lovely.  if we land in Barcelona again, we will stay here for sure!",5,2016,04,25
23,Great experience,"Very nice staff and excellent location very close to all important locations, also staff in Ohla Hotel are very friendly and helpful. I was getting daily update about my stay even before reaching Barcelona and they sent me mail with the driver and car details so it was very good experience overall.",5,2016,04,23
23,Fabulous service ,The gentlemen at the concierge desk were fabulous. The room was cleaned well daily with turndown service. All amenities were replenished in room. The location was perfect but the people were absolutely fantastic and professional. I would like to mention names but each person we interacted with at the hotel made sure to go out of their way to make sure that we had everything we could possibly need to make our stay perfect. Thank you so very much I would recommend this hotel to anyone!,5,2016,04,23
23,Perfect location,"Loved this hotel. Fab location, really helpful staff and a gorgeous roof top terrace with fantastic views. The room was modern with some extra touches and there was no road noise at all. Can't recommend it highly enough and would definitely return.",5,2016,04,22
23,The perfect hotel for a great city,"Fantastic hotel in a good location. The staff go above and beyond to help and you get the sense they really enjoy what they are doing - a real credit to the hotel. Even before arrival the hotel was impressive with an excellent and prompt response to emails and they were instrumental in setting up a surprise that I had planned ahead of our visit.

Check in was the best I have experienced in a hotel - a personal service in a private area with a glass of cava and marshmallows, exactly what is needed after a long and hot journey. 

The pool / rooftop is simply amazing and a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city below.

Recommend the Junior Suites, good size and a very functional modern design. 

We enjoyed an excellent and well priced lunch in PlassOhla, great tapas and wine selection. Breakfast was also very good. The cocktails in the bar were amazing. A very, very talented mixologist!

The concierge were also very friendly and knowledgeable. 

In summary, an excellent example of a modern 5 star hotel without any of the annoying formality which is often present.",5,2016,04,21
23,Super!,"We have stayed in many nice hotels in Barcelona but we found the Ohal to be our favorite.  The staff is extremely helpful and seems to feel it is the least they can do.  The location is perfect.  The bar has amazing cocktails, the tapas bar serves delecious food and the rooftop area is perfect with an amazing panoramic view and a bartender with a wonderful sense of humor.  We will stay in this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,04,20
23,Wonderful Botique hotel in the middle og everything!!!,"One if the best hotels I ever stayed in! Wonderful, spacey and clean rooms, adorable staff and a lovely roofbar with a nice view and a swimmingpool. 2 minutes walk  from the shopping area. Easy access to the congress center Grand Fira Via as well. Will definitely come back.",5,2016,04,19
23,"Loved our stay, can't wait to return!","We've just returned from a 2 night break and I could not recommend the Ohla Hotel highly enough. From check in to check out our stay was perfect, great location, friendly staff, lovely room (607), great food and superb roof terrace. Whilst there are obviously numerous Tapas restaurants all close by don't overlook the hotel's own restaurant in the evening as that's superb too!",5,2016,04,18
23,Perfect BCN Hotel,"This is my new go-to hotel for Barcelona. Aside from the perfect, super convenient location, good-sized and very clean room with a view, nice restaurant and bar, beautiful building, etc., what made the stay most pleasant for me was the staff. From the front desk reception and concierge to the restaurant and bar, I found everyone to be sincerely nice, competent, and efficient. Special hats off to David R. and Bernát B. - they were great and most helpful! I'm planning to return to BCN next year and most definitely will be staying here again.",5,2016,04,14
23,Great Stay!,"We stayed in this hotel for three nights and as others have commented the hotel is ideally situated on a nice road in Barcelona.  From the very beginning we were aware of the friendly and welcoming atmosphere:  they welcomed us by name when we arrived from the airport.
 The rooms were very modern, spacious and probably a bit dark and despite we slept soundly at night: we was in a Jr. suite. The front of house staff were excellent: I have to mentioned an Italian concierge (sorry I don’t remember his name)he was like a GPS and gave us wonderful recommendations for restaurants and sight seen . 
The roof top terrace is a great place to relax, get a great view of the city or take a dip.
What a great place, I would definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona.",4,2016,04,13
23,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed in the Ohla Hotel and we loved it!
Cozy and lovely 5* boutique hotel.
The one thing we loved the most was the concierge desk, very kind and collaborative in all what we needed. Special thanks to Matthieu and Albert, who where very helpful in getting football tickets, tickets for museum, Sagrada Familia and shopping trips.
Jennifer at reception desk was very kind to provide help on additional amenities when we arrived, as our luggage didn't arrive that day.
The hotel has a great location in the Barrio Gotico, very near to Plaza Catalunya and the Cathedral, as well as Passeig de Gracia. Also, near great food restaurants.
The breakfast is delicious, very well assorted and fresh. It is paid, but totally worth it.
I will definitely return again!",5,2016,04,11
23,3+* is absolute maximum for this hotel!,"This year for our wedding anniversary celebration we chose Barcelona and 5*Hotel.
After long research we made reservation in hotel Ohla. Roof top terrace on photos seemed just excellent.  

When we arrived in hotel porter didn't notice us at the entrance with luggages, other one was occupied with some other people. So it took a while to get rid of luggages and finally get to know where reception is. 

Reception room looked like hostel. Nothing luxury, basic table in the dark corner. Stuff welcomed us to the table and offered glass of cava or water.

Receptionist (unfortunately don't remember his name) informed us that our room with 2 separate beds ain't ready (????) While booking i mentioned that i want room with queen bed and large widow. How it could be even possible to make this kind of mistakes in 5* hotel?
We went to wait on the terrace. I was as beautiful as on the photos. Actually it's best part in this hotel.

We got room 701. Nice window and queen bed only positive side of this room.

Bathroom has absolutely no light to make up or shave. Round mirror not adjustable and it hight fits only for the child. Floor is broken. Left sink pipe is stucked. Black walls dirty.   
In the mornings long time have to wait for hot water. 

Toilet room needs renovation. Behind this heavy door you feel your self like in prison. And what a smell there is... I really don't know what and why you put this killer smell spray in the air but because of that i was able not to close door at all!
In the morning smell was so concentrated so i've got red eyes.

Next day after excellent city trip we noticed in the room even worser smell. It was so concentrated so we couldn't breath in the room. Window was locked so we had to ask receptionist to open it. And never again put this smell in air of our room. What a pleasure it was to sleep with open window and fresh air in the room.

Our cards didn't work longer than few hours per day. First we couldn't get in the room so we had to change keys, then same day we couldn't get on our floor by elevator, so we changed them again. But even after that they din't work. 4 times receptionists were changing keys and offering me a ride on elevator in order to check that they key is working and mine not. He offered nice solution- to go one floor down or one up(???) 
2 days we were walking like that. Is it 5* hotel - for sure not!

In the room: closet doors are done, parquet floor is done. Wall next to tv was dirty all our stay long.

Our room somebody was visiting 3 times. First cleaning, then coffee, then weather. It felt ridiculous, like somebody is checking you all the time. 
By the way 5* hotels have coffee machine in the rooms, here i din't find it...

Wifi is so slow so we were able to use roaming to send email.

Breakfast very poor like in 3* hotel.

Wellness center was quite nice but you have to fix dropping paint on the window.  

Pleasant surprise was bottle of cava on the first day. 

All this things lest unpleasant feeling from our stay in hotel Ohla. 

3+* is absolute maximum for this hotel.",3,2016,04,10
23,Great location,"Stayed for 2 nights whilst there for football match.modern rooms not huge but reasonable, very clean.great position very central location.didnt eat in the restaurant as so close to so many great restaurants,breakfast not included and €25 was a bit steep.good cafes just around the corner.",4,2016,04,09
23,"Perfect, perfect!","Delighted with our stay at Ohla. Loved the beautiful, clean, modern hotel; the rooftop with stunning views; the spacious rooms with the beautiful bathtub; and the comfy bed. Service was incredible and the breakfast was plentiful. Will definitely stay here again on my future trips to Barcelona. You can't go wrong.",5,2016,04,08
23,Amazing stay Ohla!!,"We stayed for 4 nights at the Ohla in Barcelona and had a wonderful stay! The hotel is in the best location for site seeing and getting around the city. From the airport, we took the Aerobus (5.90 Euros) to Plaza Catalunya and then it's a quick 5 minute walk from there to the hotel. The city is at your doorstep! 

The hotel restaurant is fabulous (although prices are high). We ate breakfast at the hotel each day and thoroughly enjoyed it all. The rooftop bar is perfect for afternoon drinks. 

The only knock I would give the hotel is the recommendations from the concierge. We were recommended to an Argentine restaurant that was sub par and also a wine tour that was not up to the standard I would expect from a 5 star hotel. 

I think this is a good hotel for couples and close friends...the open concept bathroom leaves very little room for privacy - so just make sure you know who you are traveling with or plan to get to know them a bit better after staying here. 

Ps. If you do stay here, there is a fantastic restaurant very close that I highly recommend. Tosca - it is located at Carrer de Sant Pere Més Alt (across from the Opera House). It was some of the best food we had - and was the least inexpensive!",5,2016,04,05
23,Premium hotel - great experience!,"The hotel is ideally located near lots of attractions. It's beautifully decorated. Staff is friendly and helpful.
The rooms are trendy decorated with an open bathroom including a rain shower (separate toilet).
Breakfast is served between 7 and 11 am and has a good service. There are fresh juices,  excellent dried ham, cheeses, fresh fruits, fresh made eggs (on demand).. and good coffee!

It's nice to relax at the rooftop sundeck with small swimming pool. Beautiful view!

They also serve superb cocktails at the bar (street level), really a must do when you like cocktails!

We tried some tapas at the restaurant (lunch). Very tasteful!

It was are second stay at Barcelona but the first time at Ohla .. We certainly come back to Barcelona, Ohla hotel it will be!",5,2016,04,04
23,Fantastic,From the moment we arrived at the Ohla Hotel we were greeted with a very happy and polite concierge.Our bags were taken and we were escorted to reception where we checked in very quickly. We were offered a drink while we checked in which was a very nice touch. The rooms were lovely and bright everything you needed all in one room. Everything about this hotel is amazing from the Staff in the bar to the staff at the rooftop pool area. Our room was cleaned every day and beds turned down for when we arrived back late at night. Thankyou Ohla hotel for making our stay in Barcelona a happy one . We will most definitely stay again and would reccomend to friends,5,2016,04,04
23,Just lovely!,"I have given this hotel an excellent rating overall because it thoroughly deserves it. 

Here are the many positive aspects of this hotel:

- First and foremost are the staff. The staff are, without exception, lovely. They were all very polite, friendly and kind. Most speak English very well.

- The hotel is ideally situated for all sorts of excellent restaurants, cafes, attractions and transport links.

- The bedrooms are large, comfortable, modern and very clean.

- The bar is small but with a very extensive menu and delicious cocktails. It's a pleasant and comfortable environment to relax in.

- Our room rate included breakfast. Breakfast at this hotel is wonderful.

- When a light bulb blew in our room, I reported it and within 20 minutes it had been replaced. Very efficient. indeed.

- The staff who serviced our room each day were very efficient and did a great job. The same staff also visit your room each evening to check that everything is ok and to ask if you need anything (extra towels, toiletries, chocolate, etc.).

There are a few, small downsides:

- There is free, unlimited wifi at the hotel (which is a definite bonus) but the signal is rather ropey. It was adequate enough for general holiday use but if you were coming here for business, it is doubtful that the wifi would be sufficient for your needs.

- The swimming pool area is just delightful but be aware that the pool is not heated. Even in good weather, therefore, it is not always warm enough to be able to swim in the pool (unless you are a very hardy swimmer).

- Oddly, a large part of the hotel (particularly the corridors where the bedrooms are) smells of sewage. Luckily, however, our room and the breakfast area did not have the same odour and the smell is therefore a minor (if puzzling) inconvenience.

Overall, therefore, despite a small number of downsides, this hotel is a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,04,03
23,Just very average!,I get the impression this hotel used to be exceptional and for one reason or another they no longer operate at the same standard. The room (junior suite) was €310 for a very basic travelodge style room feeling cramped . The bed was average but pillows very poor. The lighting was a plus point and the views from the floor to ceiling windows were a positive. We enjoyed a cocktail masterclass in the hotel and the bar man was incredibly talented but the other food and beverage consumed including a lunch and breakfast was a very overpriced and underwhelming experience. As a first weekend away from our six month old daughter and a birthday combined I can honestly say if it weren't for the company we kept during our stay we would have been very disappointed. The staff need more space to check people in but also need to speed up the 'welcome' as we waited 20 minutes whilst they confirmed our arrival. A shame. ,3,2016,04,01
23,A bit disappointed ,"The hotel is dark in the entrance, and you go upstairs to check in. All was okay and can't really complain but it's lacking, it's a bit dull. The room is fine but feels a bit cold and clinical. Bizarre glass shower in middle of room! Cant say much it's just okay...",3,2016,03,29
23,Spanish vacation,"Great hotel in a really good location in Barcelona. Breakfast was included in our stay and it was really really good. Hotel has roof top terrace, which was great to relax after the whole day of exploring the city. Staff is great and speaks very good English. We definitely stay there again.",5,2016,03,27
23,Nicest room we've ever stayed in,"It really is a beautiful hotel. 
We were on the second floor so still found it a little noisy as it is right on a major street but overall loved the experience. The rooftop terrace is one of a kind but we were there in March so the pool, while beautiful, wasn't useful (if it had been heated it would have been spectacular). 
The restaurant was tasty but after 10 days in Barcelona, I'd have to describe it as overpriced compared with other options we discovered. We also seemed to be in a dead zone for wifi in our room which wasn't a big deal. 
Getting around was incredibly easy by foot and the hotel is easily identifiable from a fair distance making it a great navigational marker. 
Overall, just a great experience.",5,2016,03,26
23,Definitely a 5 star hotel,"Yep.

We were here only one night, mainly because I couldn't afford more. But it was most definitely worth it.
There's a small area in front of the hotel in which you can stop your car, get off and enquire at the check-in where you can park. After that, the hotel staff personally takes your car to the parking they have and brings your suitcases up to your room. 
When you check in, you get a glass of cava. 
The rooms are lovely. Small, but made larger by a few steps that take you down to the bed area from the bathroom/entrance. The shower is a glass box in the middle of the room... perfect for a couple (if you know what I mean) but less so for two friends or two family members sharing a room. 
Amazing sound-proof windows and light-proof curtains. 
Breakfast was great and we were allowed to leave our car in the parking for the whole day after we checked-out. 
On the whole, a marvellous experience. Thank you!",5,2016,03,26
23,Long weekend visit ,"We had a fantastic time - hotel Ohla looked after us so well - they were happy and helpful so that made us happy, especially when they recommended places to go. They were even happy to notice that we were joyful when we were at the front door. Good stuff. 
",5,2016,03,25
23,The best hotel!!,"The ohla hotel is the best i've been to in europe.
Its location is perfect, close to the metro, close to La Rambla and to placa Catalunia. The room is excellent and the staff are very pleasent.
I will definitely come back there next time.",5,2016,03,24
23,Beautiful and Well Located Hotel,"I have just returned from a fabulous 4 night stay at the beautiful Ohla Hotel. The location of the hotel was excellent for my first trip to Barcelona. Was able to walk to all of the Barcelona sites I was interested in seeing.  Very short walk to the Barcelona Cathedral,  Picasso Museum and Palau de la Musica. Sagrada Familia was a bit further but was a beautiful 30 minute walk. Arrived on a very early flight and reception checked me in early. Room was modern. well designed and spotless. Fantastic breakfast in the lobby restaurant each morning. Staff were all excellent. Very well done Ohla!",5,2016,03,24
23,Amazing hotel in the best location! Awesome!,"My husband and I had an amazing stay at the beautiful Ohla Hotel in Barcelona. It's a perfect location, stunning views on the rooftop. The rooms are modern and the bed comfy. The staff were all so professional and smart. We would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to friends. Nice one Ohla Hotel!",5,2016,03,23
23,Ohla Hotel - very nice stay,Very nice hotel located just around the corner from the Cathedral. Rooms top quality and reception and concierge very friendly and keen to help. We did not have breakfast in our deal and when we enquired at reception we felt that 26 euro each was just too expensive. This was not a problem as there are some great cafes within very short walking distance. Shower in room is not exactly private as it has glass on 3 sides - but great shower if thats not a problem. Overall - excellent hotel.,5,2016,03,22
23,Great Location and unique rooms with style.,"This is a very elegant and modern hotel. The location is excellent as its minutes from all the key spots in City Center. The rooms were very modern and creative, and the pool on the rooftop gives a great view of the city. Great spot if your going to stay for a couple of days.",4,2016,03,21
23,Excellent location & great hotel,"Stayed at the Ohla hotel for 4 nights (02.03.16 - 06.03.16) for my husbands 40th birthday surprise.
The hotel was beautifully designed and the location was ideal.
The service was excellent and the concierge was so helpful.
His restaurant recommendations were spot on.
We booked a design room and its was perfect.
The breakfast was delicious
Everything was just excellent.
We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would stay there again",5,2016,03,16
23,Really great all round.,"Lovely clean modern room, nice bar and breakfast restaurant. Very pleasant staff and most helpful concierge. Central location with a chill out pool on the roof. I'd choose to go back again which says enough.",5,2016,03,15
23,Wonderful Barcelona City Break,From the moment we arrived at the Ohla Hotel we felt looked after by the wonderful friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble and our room was perfect we honestly couldn't think of a negative thing to say about this hotel and it's perfect central location lovely tapas bar and excellent cocktail bar which we recommended very highly we will definitely be back again thank you Ohla Hotel for making our stay perfect ,5,2016,03,14
23,Wonderful,The hotel is wonderful but check that you're ok with open plan bathrooms. The staff and surroundings are great. It's centrally located and ideal for sight seeing. The dinner could have been a bit better but it was still tasty.,5,2016,03,14
23,"Modern, stylish, nice breakfast, service and location","Very nice hotel with a great location. Nice reception upon arrival, very good lunch in the gastrobar, breakfasts were fresh and varied, rooms withou functional flaws and very modern, and stylish impressions. Will definately Return to Ohla upon the next visit!",4,2016,03,13
23,Excellent; be prepared for an extended welcome and check-in process,"I stayed here just one night on business.

The location is fantastic, with so much history and culture only steps away, not to mention the chic cafes and restaurants packed in close. 

The hotel has a modern high-end feel, if a little darker than it needs to be in some of the staircases and reception area. Checking in involved a whole welcome process - either luxurious or frustrating, depending on whether you're in a hurry or not. I was on business, so would have preferred a speedier check-in, but did enjoy the glass of cava at 11:30am :)

The room was fantastic - a comfortable soft bed, great amenities, large flatscreen TV and a well stocked minibar. One thing to note - the shower is a glass box in the middle of the room, so if you're traveling with a friend you'll get to know them very well. 

Breakfast is included, and very well stocked.

Staff speaks English fluently, so no problems there if you no hablas español.

I'd love to come back!",5,2016,03,13
23,Brilliant birthday in Barcelona,"Have just returned from a three night stay in Ohla.
Not far from the airport and a great central location. Check in was quick and were greeted with a glass of Cava. 
My boyfriend treated me to this trip and it was so nice of the hotel to include a bottle of Cava in our room as it was my birthday.
The rooms are great spacious and quiet and very clean. 
We had the most fantastic time and were lucky with the weather. The rooftop bar wasn't open but it was lovely none the less, the cocktail bar was fantastic as was the breakfast.
We will definitely return to Barcelona one day and when we do we will stay at Ohla,",5,2016,03,13
23,Wonderful hotel,"Had a long weekend break with my daughter and the beautiful Ohla hotel really helped to make our break special. All of the staff were lovely and helpful, the rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was amazing! 

Cannot wait to stay here again! ",5,2016,03,13
23,Nice hotel in a great location ,Stayed at the Ohla hotel for four nights for a short break to Barcelona. Nice hotel in a fabulous location.  Has a great cocktail bar and nice restaurant. My only criticism was our room had a balcony and as we were on the 6th floor it was against the health and safety for us to open the window - therefore the room was a little stuffy and it would have been nice to have had fresh air. Also the glass shower in the room would have been awkward if you were staying with a friend. That being said is a lovely boutique hotel which I would thoroughly recommend. If I returned to Barcelona I would definitely stay there again as good value ,4,2016,03,11
23,Great service / location and pool,"Great rooms - hotel is ideal location to explore the city from. Rooftop pool a delight even in winter, great area to relax / drink / work.

Having stayed in five other hotels in Barcelona over the years, I shall only return to the Ohla!",5,2016,03,09
23,Great location and gorgeous rooftop pool!,"Easy to notice as there are are black/white balls around the entire building that looks like eyes. Lots of nearby shopping and minutes from Catedral de Barcelona. What sold my BF about this hotel was the rooftop infinity pool. The view is absolutely gorgeous! You can actually walk along side the pool as well and watch the people swimming under water. Our room had a view of a wall unfortunately, but we were hardly in the room for it to matter much. Hotel decor was very chic and modern.

After a hectic flight, the check-in process was fairly pleasant. You are 1st greeted by the concierge. The check-in desks are actually upstairs so they will guide you to the person who will assist you. We were given a glass of cava and a map of the area (with some tips). Unfortunately our rooms were not ready so we had to check our bags and come back at a later time. We were in and out of the hotel at off peak times so when we needed some help, there wasn't always someone at the concierge desk to assist.

BF absolutely loved the hotel. I've had better customer service elsewhere so just thought it was ok.",4,2016,03,08
23,"Good Location, helpful staff","The location - we walked about everywhere- to the waterfront and to several of the Gaudi houses. Its close to the subway system, which is easy to use. 
The staff- Amazing! Whether it was recommending a place to eat, providing directions or maps, tickets, advice- the staff was most helpful. They remember your name and room number, ask how the food, the performance or the sight was. Even arranged for a brown bag breakfast for a 5:00 am departure from the hotel to catch our flight. 
The roof top bar has amazing views although it was fairly windy and chilly when we were there in October.
Breakfast was very good although service was lacking the first morning we were there. Too many people arrived at once. The following day, more staff was added.
Enjoyed a wonderful late night dinner our last night. One of the best meals we had in Barcelona. We have recommended this hotel more than once to friends that are heading to Barcelona.",5,2016,03,07
23,Wow!,"Overall experience, 4.5 stars. The Ohla Hotel is wonderfully located. Close to a lot of things to see and do all within walking distance. We stayed at the Junior Suite and it was spacious and cozy. Views from the room was amazing. Housekeeping was wonderful and we always felt like home. Concierge were very helpful. Check-in was quick and we were given glasses of cava. Check out there was a very minor hiccup, but nothing too serious. The Ohla Bar was quaint and the award winning drinks were delicious. Very quiet hotel. If traveling in February, weather is a bit chilly.",5,2016,03,07
23,Lovely stay at Ohla hotel,I highly recommend this hotel!The staff were very polite and helpful and upgraded us to a suite as a birthday treat! Ideally located for Gothic quarter and Born. Beautiful view of the town from the rooftop!The breakfast was great too!,5,2016,03,06
23,Lovely friendly central hotel,Check in was flawless cava given to us while doing paperwork then on to the roof terrace while waiting for our room where views are stunning. Staff so friendly and anything you need they will help you with. The room was very clean and quiet room 412. Breakfast was very good and plenty to keep you going ready for a busy day. Would definitely recommend this hotel it is so central to everything and you can walk to most places if I came back to Barcelona would have no hesitation to stop at the ohla again. If you do decide to stop here I would also recommend a restaurant called con gracia check it out on trip advisor had the experience menu with chosen wines not cheap but excellent food.,5,2016,03,05
23,Lovely central boutique hotel,"First impressions of this hotel were impressive - nice sleek design, very good service culture, and welcomed at reception with champagne. We stayed in their basic room, which didn't have the ""wow"" factor you'd expect from a 5*, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. Also be warned! Our shower was totally made of glass and looked onto the room, so for couples it's great but if you're sharing with friends best to ask about your options! 

There's a rooftop outdoor pool, which has a stunning view over the city, but it is small (more for paddling) and there are no facilities to swim indoors during the colder months. There's also a gym, but it's small and just does the job. 

The restaurant on the ground floor has wonderful food, and the room service was lovely. 

Ohla is situated in the Gotik quarter, within reach of the Sagardia Familia, the Marina, and everything in between. It's a good location.

Overall, a very pleasant stay. ",5,2016,02,27
23,Half term family trip to Barcelona. Ohla hotel,"Barcelona
A lovely city to visit.
Blue sky, friendly people and good food.

We stumbled upon Ohla Hotel on the Internet and appeared good.
Upon arrival it became apparent we made a good decision. Just about the friendliest staff that did everything and beyond to make sure our trip was good.
Hotel was clean and well presented. 
We treated ourselves to the penthouse which has 2 interconnecting rooms and just about the highest ceiling I have seen in a hotel. 
Breakfast was good and also ate in their tapas restaurant. Didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised.
Concierge were very helpful in recommending some excellent restaurants in town.

Hotel well situated to explore the delights of Barcelona and have no negatives.
",5,2016,02,27
23,Best in Barcelona...hands down.,"From a fabulous location to a great room you were set to go. The registration event began with flutes of ""Cava"" and an extremely friendly staff. It was only later to find that the concierge staff was some of the more knowledgeable I have ever experienced where their ""crossed key"" emblems were well earned for there wisdom, knowledge and suggestions for the city. We were enchanted and would go back tomorrow. 

Great place...If you are going to Barcelona and REALLY want to see the city in its ancient form as well as its' modernity...go HERE.

Its as simple as that.",5,2016,02,25
23,Roll on return!!,"Just got back from a four night visit to the wonderful city of Barcelona where we stayed right in the heart of the pulsating Catalan empire!!! If you like to stay in the thick of it in a trendy well appointed hotel with friendly staff - look no further!! This is your ideal destination hotel - can't wait to go back again when the weather is a bit more amenable and we can swim in the roof top pool!!! Definitely recommend booking breakfast here cos it sets you up nicely for the day and is served until 11 ( very civilised!).
Staff excellent - rooms prepared thoroughly every day and food outside of breakfast worth a try!
To quote Arnie - we will be back!!!!!",5,2016,02,22
23,Fantastic Hotel,My husband and I came for a long weekend and the staff were very helpful and recommended some very nice restaurants that the locals would use. The room was ample for our needs and all facilities were as you would expect for a 5* hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again when returning to Barcelona.,5,2016,02,21
23,Ohla hotel - Black Friday visit,"We stayed at Ohla hotel at the time of Black Friday weekend. It was not planned but it really was worth it. 
We got room on 2nd floor so I would suggest the higher ones if possible. The room we got had no possibility to open the window but the airconditioning was doing the job. As to the street noise I would recommend the higher floor as well. The room was specious with walked in shower and bath tub as well.Nice furnishing, bed very comfy.
The hotel location is perfect for Rambla shopping and Born visit. Very close everywhere and nice walk all the way up Rambla. Breakfast was good but I was missing more vegetables for breakfast (tomatoes only). To be honest I did not ask for others so I cannot say if they provide more (my mistake, if you do not ask you do not get). 
If you shop in big brands stores you can have the bags delivered to hotel free of charge, one of the plus services offered at the time we were there. 
The concierge was very helpful, wiling to help and give advice. 
One down side was that we had to pay for late checkout but it was not that much. I surely can understand that they cannot do what other hotels do if they have only 70rooms. Hotel with 500 rooms would have a different approach. 
We felt very much pampered and welcomed. I would recommend Ohla to everyone keen on shopping and sightseeing. The stops of sightseeing bus tours are very close to the hotels.",5,2016,02,16
23,Great boutique hotel with great service!,"Had a wonderful few nights at Ohla hotel last week. Started with our noon check in with welcoming front office, enjoyed the modern bright and spacious room with turndown services. Breakfast buffet and service was excellent, especially by Milena. 

We were allowed late check out on our day of departure, which topped our very pleasant stay. 

Location was quite central to shopping and entertainment. Definitely worth the quality presented for the value!",5,2016,02,16
23,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff","The best thing about the Ohla hotel is the staff, very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was lovely and the rooms (junior suite) are spacious and comfortable, although the bathrooms are open to the bedroom. The location is great, although being in the centre of town, we did find it quite noisy (street noise)",5,2016,02,16
23,Amazing hotel and we loved the stay!,"We stayed here 4 nights and we were super happy.  The staff is great, very friendly and helpful.  The room we got was a junior suite, very nice and roomy.  My partner had a birthday while we stayed here and they send up a bottle of Cava and a nice note.  We got the breakfast with the room and we loved it.  We would definitely come back here. ",5,2016,02,15
23,Unforgettable in more ways than one,"Incredible from start to finish in every way!! We could not find one fault with this modern and lavish hotel. Our stay was just before Christmas and was booked by my boyfriend as a surprise so that he could take the opportunity to propose =D And he could not have picked a better city or hotel in which to do it. The hotel is in the top 5 in Barcelona so a stay and staying here is not cheap. But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for and this was money very well spent. It's situated in the heart of the Gothic Quarter which is littered with quirky restaurants, bars and boutique shops as well as high street names. The staff were well presented, intelligent and so attentive. The decor throughout the hotel is a mixture of dark and light materials with contemporary fittings. It oozes quality and class from floor to ceiling. The bedroom had an open plan bathroom and mood lighting to create a relaxing and decadent feel. The cocktail bar is one of the Top in the world!! Watching those guys was like watching artists at work as they mixed fresh herbs and fruits to freshly infuse the alcoholic beverages. We dined in the Sauc restaurant on the last night having the multi course tasting menu. It was like nothing I've experienced before. Overly salty which was the only negative of our stay. But delicious none the less. And the best was saved until last; cocktails on the roof top bar overlooking the city where he asked me to be his wife. A trip and stay that I will never forget",5,2016,02,14
23,Superb hotel in great location ,"Stayed with my wife for a romantic break in February and it was a dream hotel.

Excellent location and the service was second to none from concierge, to check-in, to waiting staff, all superb.

Was a bit cool for a dip in the roof terrace pool but it looked beautiful and a great view of the city.

Stayed in a suite and highly recommend. 

All in all you can't top it for location and style.

23,Excellent,"Excellent location.clean rooms.great and friendly staff.room was cleaned twice daly.concierge was extremely helpful in picking local restaurents and shows.

Somewhat limited in breakfat choice .

23,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location! ","My husband picked this hotel for our visit to Barcelona. He did a great job! Not only is the hotel clean, beautiful, and well laid out, but the staff were kind and helpful every step of the way. They gave us guidance on maps, restaurants, and shopping. Anything we needed they were quick to help with. I speak Spanish, but my husband only speaks English. Most of the staff spoke several languages. We chose to include breakfast with our stay. The food was delicious and the coffee even better! The rooftop pool and lounge area is lovely too. Not warm enough to swim right now, but we enjoyed the view and a glass of wine on the roof. The location was wonderful! We were in and out several times a day. We did not need to take a taxi or any other transportation while there. Most attractions, shops, and restaurants are within walking distance. ",5,2016,02,03

23,Experience Barcelona at the Ohla,"We experienced a very nice reception and were provided early check in when we arrived after our cruise. The room was spacious, beautifully furnished, comfortable and quiet. Turn down service was also offered. Amenities were exquisite and we received a welcome gift from the manager. After exploring Barcelona (perfect location for this) all day it was a treat to relax at the  Ohla. Definitely staying at the here next time we are here.",5,2016,01,31
23,Top notch service,We stayed here in Mid January for 4 days and we were so impressed with the service and the hotel. Every staff member we interacted with went above and beyond. From the concierge to the awesome bar staff. Everything about this hotel is great. Highly recommended. ,5,2016,01,30
23,lovely two night stay sans children,"We stayed here for two nights without or two kids for a friends wedding. Weleft Sunday lunchtime. Check in was superb- got to sit down at a table and given a glass of prosecco (not sure if this is mandatory) so we felt great for the moment we arrived!
We had the rooms where you have the transparent shower cubicle in the centre of the room, so if you don't want this then you should take care on your booking. We ate at the Sauc and had the 9 course taster menu which in hindsight the 6 would have been ample. But faultless service and I can recall two dishes so that's something good. Breakfast is good - downstairs on the ground floor- somehow it does't feel like a hotel there which is nice- it feels more like a cafe (I guess its the high glass windows that look out onto the pedestrian shopping street). We booked a taxi service to take us to the wedding through the concierge who was excellent. The rooftop pool is quite small (we didn't go in) but I'm sure would have a lovely vibe in the summer when the bar would be open.",4,2016,01,29
23,"Great Location, Exceptional Service and Wonderful Rooms","This was our first trip to Spain, and our stop in Barcelona was at the end of the trip.  We arrived late in the evening and were treated with the best service not only at the concierge desk at the door, but at reservations one half level up.  The staff spoke English well, but obliged us patiently by speaking only Spanish so we could practice ours.  The rooms were clean bright and comfortable with great beds and amenities,  We were originally only staying one night and decided to stay 2 additional days because the location was perfect.  The first night we had a room with a see thru shower in the middle of the room.  Not the best feature unless we were both model thin, and even then...  We moved to a slightly bigger room the second and third nights that had a tub and were much more comfortable with the shower separated from the bedroom by a wall.  The toilet is behind a flush movable wall which may be a great modern aesthetic concept, but difficult to find in a hurry and the door spring closes with very sharp edges which my husband unfortunately cut his finger fairly severely in when it closed.  But the rest of the room with closet space etc was wonderful.  Breakfast was also included in our stay and delicious.
We were able to walk to the main square and on to the market and several areas of Barcelona, walk to the beach, and walk to many of the fun tapas and other restaurants all nearby.  It truly was a great location and a splendid hotel.  We will stay here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,01,26
23,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is located at the gothic quarter, with easy access to Plaza Catalunya and the Rambla.
Rooms are large, the staff is greindly and breakfast is excellent.
There is a very good Tapas restaurant at the lbbey.",5,2016,01,26
23,Honeymoon hotel,"We visited this hotel for three nights on the first part of our honeymoon, the hotel was lovely and the staff and facilities were great. However, there was a mix-up with our booking which meant we could not stay in the room we had booked or eat in the restaurant on the evenings we had booked. The management did try to sort this out for us but I feel they could have been a little bit more helpful as we had booked 6 months in advance, they treated us as if we were just regular guests rather than on our honeymoon. Overall I was very happy but this issue tainted my visit slightly.",3,2016,01,24
23,Excellent,"Could not fault this hotel from the moment we arrived.  Great location - you can walk to several interesting places, and the metro is only yards away.  The room was just right for us, breakfast delicious, and the views from the roof top were perfect.  The best part of our stay was provided by the three Concierges.  They could not have been more helpful, suggesting restaurants, making bookings for us, providing information on the city - everything you expect from a concierge.  They actually made you feel important, and always remembered our names when we came back from a trip.  Small things like make a difference.",5,2016,01,22
23,Perfect stay in Barcelona,"Absolutely lovely hotel perfect for exploring all that Barcelona has to offer. Very close to the main square and the shops. La Rambla is a short walk away.
The staff are knowledgeable, efficient and excel in customer service. Nothing was too much trouble and all requests we had were met. Our room was not ready on arrival so we enjoyed the wonderful rooftop views before having lunch in La Plassohla. The food was good and an excellent way to start a weekend trip in the City.
The rooms are stylish with all the mod cons. The room we stayed in had a glass shower, so if shy, make sure you check this before booking. 
The bar is intimate with amazing cocktails comparable to London prices and made with flair and style. Worth enjoying one or two pre or post dinner
I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Barcelona. Great staff in a stylish setting.",5,2016,01,22
23,a modern and stylish place in the Gothic Quarter,"You will be amazed by the facade: thousands of eyeballs all over the historic city palais. Really cool. Thr rooftop terrace has a glass frames infinity pool and you have amaizng views all the way to the sea. The real starts are the concierges at Ohla Hotel. They are so helpful, have a wealth of experience and pick the best restaurants, bars etc for you. They are the real starts. The only downside was at our arrival in the early evening. The lady at the reception who checked us in wasn't interested at all, made no effort. Other people were offered champagne/water. She didn't care at all, handed us the room keys and left. She probably wanted to go home.........that was a very bad first impression and welcome experience.",4,2016,01,21
23,Centrally located casual boutique luxury hotel,"Went for two days in early January. Hotel has a great focus on service. Good attention to detail. I thought the staff were all friendly, competent, and accessible. The location is in the center of the touristy part of town, but you can also easily get to the metro. We weren't able to use the pool in January, but the roof still had great views, especially to watch the Three Kings parade that ran in front of the hotel. And as an example of how nice they were, they gave us wine glasses to drink a bottle of wine we'd bought at a wine store while we watched the parade. Chic and sophisticated without being flashy. ",5,2016,01,20
23,Wonderful Experience with a Caring & Patient Staff,"The Hotel itself deserves its 5 star rating with a 5 star review.  The staff makes a complete joint effort to make its Guests feel comfortable.  I greatly appreciate the personal touch of walking us into our room and showing us the bathroom location in the room(yes, it will appear hidden when you walk in).The breakfast buffet was delicious and fresh, NEVER appeared heated up frozen foods as such other hotels do.  The staff at the restaurant downstairs as a team put max effort with accommodation to our family of 4 thanks to Adrian and the other staff team.The cocktails prepared by Santi & Team were out of this world.The view and location are 100+++. I will stay here again, and recommend to our friends and family without hesitation. We Miss the hotel already!",5,2016,01,04
23,Eyeballs on the facade and a glass-sided rooftop pool with 360-degree views to die for,Neoclassic-style boutique hotel conveniently located steps from the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. There's a casual gastropub and glass-sided swimming pool with amazing 360-degree views on the rooftop. The breakfast buffet included in the room rate was exceptional complete with Cava (Spanish champagne).,4,2016,01,01
23,"Great location, nice boutique hotel.","Upscale boutique hotel with immaculate rooms and excellent service.  The location is ideal for shopping and touring.  Breakfast was included and was very nice. Eggs, waffles, pancakes made to order, and the usual buffet stuff. I would definitely stay there again. The location of the showers was unique as long as you are not shy (see pic).",5,2016,01,01
23,Beautiful Hotel! Great Hospitality!,"Best deal for location and quality, minutes from restaurants, shopping, pier and about a 20 min walk to Sagrada Familia. Amazing customer service, restaurant and beautiful lounge with delicious cocktails.
Staff was extremely helpful and professional as well. Definitely worth comparing with other hotels before traveling to Barcelona! ",5,2015,12,21
23,Wow Barca you excel again...,This is a perfect hotel right in the middle of the shopping district...Easy to walk to most tourist spots.  Service excellent but the real real gem in this hotel is the roof top...a wonderful oasis to soak up the winter sun when feeling a little hungover.  I would stay here again...just perfect...:),5,2015,12,16
23,Great Hotel in perfect location,Really enjoyed the location of the hotel.  It's a lovely building with beautiful comfortable rooms.  Centrally located but not too close to the noisier areas.  Loved the Junior Suite.  Very luxurious.  Thanks.,5,2015,12,14
23,Best hotel in Spain,"This was the best hotel out of the many we stayed at during our travel to Spain for so many reasons.

The bathroom is usually what is most important to me and their bathroom is the best. It is intertwined into the room. The shower is in a big cube nearly in the center of the room and is a largely-spaced standing shower. The shower had both rain and handheld showerheads, and the waterflow was strong and powerful. 

The bed was so comfortable because it was NOT soft, sheets were probably 700-stitch because the sheets were soft; the best combination. We had our best sleep yet, almost missed seeing sights in Barcelona because we were sleeping so comfortably.

Located in the city center, we had a view from our window to La Sagrada Familia. Calling a taxi was so easy since there were many bustling by in the front of the hotel. Everything was in walking distance.

Fully-staffed. They changed our sheets every day. The check-in was immediate, no waiting at all. Whenever we needed something, someone came to drop it off immediately. 

Whereas other hotels' idea of ""continental breakfast"" means nothing hot (different from the international standard), Ohla's continental breakfast was great because there was actually something cooked, specifically: eggs.

Some TA comments are not reliable but this one is. If you are going to Barcelona, stay here because of all the above reasons. Most importantly, the name is so easy to remember: Ohla!",5,2015,12,13
23,Good place,"This si a Great hotel, we spent 4nights over the weekend of the 7 and quality/price was extremely good. I don't rated it 5points because of the breakfast was a deception, I don't suggest it to get it inclusive. There is a bar just in front that give you the same for half the price.",4,2015,12,12
23,A few days in Barcelona,"A very good hotel but not really a 5star, more a very good 4star.   Concierge were brilliant,very helpful. Staff extremely pleasant. Try & get a higher floor, away from the noise of the busy road. We had a junior suite, plenty of room for a city hotel, good fixtures & fittings.  Excellent position for sightseeing.  The only criticism I had was there was a very nasty smell in the corridor,  the staff did what they could to resolve it . After 24hrs things did improve.",4,2015,12,07
23,. Excellent!,"Was here for 3 days on a business trip. Excellent hotel, much more personalized service then any of the large business hotel chains. Location is perfect if you want to explore the amazing city of barcelona, middle of city centre and close to the boulevard and beach. Restaurant and cocktail bar exceptional. Small minus is the very basic gym area, but hey, close to the beach, so great motivation for an outdoor run.",5,2015,12,04
23,"Great hotel - great drinks, food and rooms ","Great hotel - great drinks, food and rooms - great location - ..... Staff was really friendly and helpful - the concierge helped us arrange everything - museums, dinners and clubs 
no doubt ... It's the best place to stay in Barcelona .........",5,2015,12,04
23,Excellent Choice,Perfect hotel in the perfect location in the center of the Gothic district and walking distance to just about everything. We booked a Junior Suite which had more than enough room along with a very comfortable bed (without the shower being in the middle of the room). The rooftop area afforded a wonderful view of the Barcelona skyline and a really enjoyable area to just relax. The breakfast was very good with a wide selection to choose from. Last but not least the staff went the extra distance to make our stay very enjoyable. Would highly recommend this hotel to all visiting Barcelona!,5,2015,11,13
23,Could not have picked better,"Returning home after a long trip away from home My wife booked us a romantic break in Barcelona staying at this delightful hotel.
Everything about the hotel was excellent which started at the front doors when met by the brilliant concierge team.
The rooms are great and the rooftop terrace was a amazing.
Every member of staff that we had dealings with were very courteous and friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there.
I would recommend this hotel to couples or VERY friendly traveling companions. I say this because the room layout had a shower with glass sides which was almost in the middle of the room. I thought it was great because I like looking at my wife but I could imagine a little embarrassment if people were not so inclined.",5,2015,11,11
23,Wonderful and friendly,Excellent location in the heart of the Gothic district and walking distance to almost everything.  The hotel and room were both beautiful and the staff friendly and helpful from arranging airport transfers to booking hard to get dinner reservations.  Highly recommended.,5,2015,11,11
23,Modern/Design Hotel with Strategic Location,"Ohla joins an increasing number of hotels that emphasize modern design. The problem is that modern design has different expressions, from contemporary to extreme that may not suit all tastes. Ohla is somewhere in the middle so I assume that will cater to the taste of most people. The only possible uncomfortable point in the rooms is the shower that is glass walled at full view of your roommate, meaning that you better be close and cozy with the person sharing the room. The service is good (without going to extremes) and bathroom amenities (Prija) are high quality without being from some internationally recognized brand. Breakfast is excellent and what tops it all is the location of the hotel which I find strategic in the sense that, if you are a tourist, you can walk to both the old city (El Barri Gotic) as well as the posh shopping area of Passeig de Gracia. Although Ohla is typically a 5* hotel, I would grade it between 4stars and 5stars, depending on your experiences. What I mean is that I cannot give it the same rating as, for example, the Mandarin. Of course one may argue that Ohla is a 5* star hotel and Mandarin belongs to the ""Grand Hotel"" category. That said, I definitely recommend the Ohla hotel and probably return provided the price is right.",5,2015,11,08
23,Really good hotel ,We stayed on a short break - the tapas restaurant is good quality and reasonable value - the hotel is overall nice and clean and quiet in a very good location in the gothic quarter - service generally was very good - the internet connection was a bit poor but that was the only downside - the roof terrace was a really nice place to chill out,4,2015,11,01
23,Lovely hotel and location,"We had a lovely, comfortable, chic, modern room at the Ohla Hotel. Wish we had more than one night to stay. The location is perfect, excellent staff at reception and a very helpful concierge. The breakfast was delicious in the modern breakfast room. A nice touch was coffee and croissants in the ""waiting room""/bar. I hope to stay again. ",5,2015,10,30
23,"A glorious ""mistake""","We had booked at another hotel (Neri) months before and confirmed it, but they gave away our reservation and had the car take us to the Ohla instead. This was truly a benign gift as the Ohla was everything we could have prayed for: helpful staff (who also could speak English), personalized service, understanding about our being ""bummed"" at first by the unexpected switch. They explained everything, gave us a lovely room at the same price and helped us orient ourselves to this busy city.  The location was close to the Ramblas and we chose to walk the 45 minutes to the Sagrada, and later to the Piasso museum. We had wine on the top floor (outdoor) terrace, which overlooks most of Barcelona & the gorgeous nearby cathedral. As
the waiter served Chardonnay, the bells of the cathedral started ringing. Our last night we enjoyed a fab light meal in the downstairs restaurant along with Spanish wine. ""Daniel"" at the front desk had the perfect sushi recommendation ready when we inquired--a 1-star Michelin place within 5 min. walk.  What a glorious ""mistake""
the Neri Hotel made when they booked us at the Ohla instead--as we will return there again and recommend the Ohla to anyone who needs a recommendation in Barcelona.",5,2015,10,27
23,Ohla Hotel - Bravo!,"We recently had a wonderful stay at Ohla Hotel in Barcelona near the Bari Gotic district. It is a smallish personal hotel with excellent service and fine appointments. The room was comfortable, the concierge service was very helpful and responsive and the restaurant and bar options were fun - including a rooftop bar with a fabulous view and a delicious tapas menu on the first floor. Not cheap - but well worth it.",4,2015,10,25
23,"Good hotel, excellent location","A good 4* hotel, Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped , strange having a glass shower in the middle of the room. Breakfast was OK but service was slow. All other staff very helpful, especially concierge.",4,2015,10,25
23,Good location ,The hotel had a good location.  I was able to walk to most sights.  You could hear a train run under the hotel was my main complaint.  Also the suite I had has a big opening between the bathroom and bedroom thy could be awkward. The AC worked well as did the hot water both were great for a hotel. ,4,2015,10,22
23,Nice hotel in the midst of it all!,"The Ohla hotel is a very nice boutique hotel right in the middle of Barcelona. The location is excellent, and is within walking distance of all major sites (30 mins or less to pretty much anything you'd want to see)! The rooms were clean and spacious and as advertised. The hotel is a little noisy (it is on a busy street), but otherwise quiet and pleasant.

The concierge was excellent in arranging transfers and trips, etc. They also had a lot of little extras thrown in, such as nice complimentary cheese plates, tapas plates with sometimes a bottle of wine every evening. Breakfast was very nice as well, tho a little disorganized service wise.

My only complaint was with room service, and this might be regional preference. We ordered fish and a burger, and both were cool and under done (including the fish). Again this might be local preference, so if you order and want things medium and fish cooked warmer, might be a good idea to request such!

Otherwise, I don't think you will be disappointed! Even as a",5,2015,10,19
23,In the heart of Barcelona,"Very nice boutique hotel in a perfect location. Very nice welcome and check in with a glass of Cava and escort to our room.  The concierge service was extremely helpful each day.  Rooms were nice- ours had a clear glass shower in the middle of the room, which took a bit of getting used too.  The rooftop bar had an amazing view and nice drinks (but very calm).  Breakfast  was just OK, selection was minimal and service was non-consistent.  Overall a nice stay.",4,2015,10,16
23,Excellent concierge,We stayed here for five nights and had a great time. The hotel is really in an excellent location - you walk straight out into the old town but can also walk to the Gaudi houses and tapas district. I really want to say a big thank you to the team at the concierge desk. They gave us such fabulous recommendations for food and were so genuine and easy going. It made our stay all the better. A very minor things they could improve on - breakfast service was often very slow and drink prices at the rooftop bar were out of control! However I would still stay there again readily.,5,2015,10,15
23,Boutique Scented Hotel!,"Although I am a little late in writing this review, I think that the hotel does deserve recognition. We arrived on a slightly wet night in November 2014. The welcome was warm and professional and within minutes we were enjoying a glass of Cava while checking in. We were then assisted to our Junior suite on the corner of the building: quite spacious and exactly as advertised on the hotel's website. The hotel is fairly small, with lots of low lighting and (unless it's changed) there is a fairly pronounced ""hotel smell"". Patchouli, I would say. I love this, but at times it was fairly strong. The location is excellent as it's within easy walking distance of Catalan square, Ramblas, the beach and so on. The breakfast is tasty and comprehensive. If you would like a rather extravagant cocktail, the hotel bar is worth trying. The cocktail served in a shell, inside a treasure chest with smoke pouring out is good fun! This was our third stay in Barcelona and, in my opinion, the best so far. I would recommend the Ohla hotel to anyone who is looking for a good quality boutique hotel which is centrally located. I think during the summer months, the rooftop pool would be amazing!",5,2015,10,14
23,Easy to stay.,"Good location and friendly staffs but nothing.
stayed 4 days and breakfast wass just so so. roof top bar is not big enough and pool is very small.
I think it is not 5 stars hotel.(but price is 5 stars).
Don't respect lots of things.
I will not stay here next time.",3,2015,10,13
23,Ohla Rooftop Bar,"I didn't actually stay at this hotel, but was invited to the rooftop bar with swimming pool.  The ambience and view were amazing!  They had very nice cocktails and drinks.  You might pay a little more as it is part of a 5-star hotel, but it is well worth it, especially on a hot summers night!",4,2015,10,13
23,Fabulous hotel!,From the minute we walked in we were greeted warmly. Daniel checked us in with a glass of champagne and went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel. Great location too!,5,2015,10,13
23,Amazing,"5 star service and 5 star hotel. From the minute we stepped in the hotel everything was really amazing. Lovely room, excellent service, great location. Amazing pool terrace with breath taking view. Quite expensive but worth it.",5,2015,10,13
23,What a wonderful hotel,"This is one of my all time favorite hotels.  I've been meaning to write a review on the Olah for a long time as it was so good. I had high expectations already as it was a recommendation from a friend but the room, location and service surpassed all of these.

I visited on my 'mini-moon' and could barely fault a single thing about the hotel.  On arrival we were seated and given a complementary glass of Cava,  Check in was quick and easy and the staff were great.  We had a junior sweet with a great view and on arrival to our room we had a complementary bottle of Cava, which was very nice!

The room was great, very modern and large. Turn-down service was excellent and the general level of cleanliness in the room and hotel was exceptional.

The roof top pool is lovely and we had a couple of relaxing afternoons in the sun chilling out there.  The female staff on the pool bar could have been a little more friendly, but the view and relaxing environment meant it didn't matter!

The concierge was excellent and gave us a great restaurant recommendations, booked tickets for Sagrada Familia and a Flamenco show (although the one we went to was a little long and serious - i think the shorter more 'fun' ones are better!)

The breakfast was really good as the general high level or service and quality continued.  Finally the cocktail bar was brilliant, really original and tasty drinks rounding off a thoroughly excellent, friendly and luxury hotel!  I look forward to visiting again!",5,2015,10,12
23,Great hotel,"Had a wonderful stay at Ohla hotel for the last two nights of our Honeymoon in Spain. The hotel is in a great location. Our room was massive, with a bath and couch, and had two things that we didn't get in other 5 star hotels in Spain - a coffee machine and an iron.  Cosmetics in the bathroom very high quality. The only negative was the service in the plahssola restaurant - both at breakfast and dinner the service was slow and forgetful. The food at dinner (tapas) was delicious and worth the higher cost than what you'd expect to pay in a small bar.",5,2015,10,09
23,what a 5 star hotel should be,"the staff are freindy and very polite, the room we had was on the third floor with a view of the main street ,we could hear a little traffic noise ,but not enough to be annoying. the choice at breakfast was excellent being served 7am till 11am. The views from the rooftop bar/pool area were amazing. The location is ideal for everything, With the stop for the hop on hop off bus just 200 yds. away and the marina about 10 minutes stroll.",5,2015,10,07
23,A wonderful gem centrally located in Barcelona,"A luxurious gem in the heart of Barcelona with wonderful trendy rooms and good facilities such as very good restaurants and a lounge rooftop bar with swimming pool and stunning views.

23,Clean and modern boutique hotel.,"Room- really clean, good shower, space for your toiletries, vanity mirror, good lighting, easy to work air con/ heating system, wooden floors, nice and quiet.

Breakfast- speaking as a gluten-free diner..... a selection of teas and coffees, fresh fruits, natural yoghurt, kefir and some kind of 'fromage frais', honey, omelettes. The hotel did offer me gluten-free bread, but I don't eat this.

Staff- very helpful.

Location- excellent

The hotel is in a contemporary style. It's not opulent, so don't expect the George V or Plaza Athenee.....but a very clean and tidy boutique hotel.
The hotel has a roof top terrace/bar/pool.... attractive for the summer/ great weather. 

Yes..... we would stay in this hotel again.",4,2015,10,01
23,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights at the beginning of August to kick off our two week EuroTrip, and it started off with a bang!

After 24+ hours of travelling, we checked into our room early in the afternoon, and had a short crash on the bed, before heading up to the roof to check out the pool, and the lovely views, along with a cocktail or two.  The roof top of this hotel is stunning, and a great way to unwind for a bit after exploring all day, and before getting ready to head out for supper.

The rooms are spacious, and quiet, I don't ever remember hearing noise from other rooms, and the open glass shower is a nice touch!

We didn't eat at the restaurant,  so I can't give you a review of that, but one night we had a late night drink once we got back in at the lobby lounge, and I must say the bartenders there are artists!  Its well worth a drink or ten!",4,2015,10,01
23,Great hotel and staff,"Select this hotel cause some review, got there and the reception from he staff outstanding, pomp was not ready but they went out of their way to help us take car of luggage etc.

Will go back without a doubt, recommend highly.",5,2015,09,29
23,Boutique Luxury!,"Location: In the heart of Barcelona! Perfect location for everything you want to see.

I was greeted with Cava. Bonus points!

Rooms: 
Besides the suites the rooms are on the smaller side but still very spacious. Large King size bed that was very comfortable. All glass shower which is amazing if you're a couple. Very modern, clean and sleek looking rooms. Plenty of room for everything you bring. Impressive refrigerator with a lot of choices to drink from. Floor to ceiling glass windows too. Rooms were very quite, I didn't hear any street noise or people outside the room. 

Cost vs Value: 
Worth every penny.

Rooftop: 
Impressive views of the city with an all glass pool. Fully staffed pool with food and drink options as well as a cabana or just regular lounge chairs. Please people do not do laps in this pool it's a lounging pool not your gym pool. Did I mention it was an all glass pool? Pretty cool I must admit. 

Staff:
Wow, they were on it. I received phone calls daily if I needed anything. Turn down service, more towels etc etc.

Elevators:
Pretty nice elevators for bringing things up and down, fast and efficient & large for European standards.  

Sauc:
YOU must eat here if you're a foodie. Not to mention being a Michelin rated restaurant. Other people online will say there are better options for restaurants. I will be very honest, this was top notch and I'm from NYC where we have a lot of great food. Go and enjoy, plus it's in your hotel so you can roll right upstairs. 

We had breakfast here in the morning as well at the downstairs restaurant. Very impressive spread. A lot of options.

Parking: 
Nothing on site as far as I know. I had a rental car and it was very hard to actually pull up in front bc it's a busy street, but me being a NY'er I pulled up and put on my hazards and the staff helped me unload my car. Police rolled right by me with no problems. I returned my rental that day, but the city seems to have a lot of parking garages and the hotel might as well. Not to sure about the options they have. 

Interior: 
It's dark, romantic  & seductive (yup seductive) very nice decor and design. 

Highly recommend. It's worth it.",5,2015,09,29
23,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"Junior suite on the 6th floor.  Spacious for a European hotel.  Contemporary decor
The hotel is in a great location.  10-20 minutes in any direction to get to great shopping, restaurants or the beach. The roof top pool and bar was a great bonus.  Loved coming back from a day of touring the city and relaxing by the pool and viewing the city while having a cocktail.    The staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast was more than adequate.  I would stay here again the next time I'm in town.",5,2015,09,29
23,As good as it gets,"From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, the staff were friendly, efficient, interested and very good at their jobs. The room was spacious, clean, modern. The roof top pool and bar were a real treat, with fantastic view of the city. Breakfast was all you needed, with cooked meals if you ordered. The Sauc restaurant (see separate review) was brilliant. The location of the hotel was perfect, being 10 mins from the sea, 3 mins from La Ramblas and the Cathedral, 30 seconds from a very convenient metro station, from which you could easily access most of the sites which were not in walking distance.
A hotel is only as good as its staff, and therefore this was a very good hotel.",5,2015,09,29

Fantastic restaurants and pool.    From arrival until checkout, the hotel staff were welcoming, helpful, and made us feel very special.   We will stay there again!!",5,2015,09,28
23,Ideal place to stay in Barcelona,"This is the place to stay if you are looking for comfort, easy access to Rambla, Plaza Catlunia, the port and shops and restaurants and yet peace and quiet when you finally turn in for the night's sleep. Great breakfast, and excellent Michelin rated restaurant.
 The staff are extremely friendly and go out of their way to help you with all the information and guidance that you may require. I must specially mention Mr. Albert Meier, the chief concierge, who tirelessly explained the world that is Barcelona to us and everybody else who requested his assistance, in variety of languages.
We stayed there twice, during early and mid September. The second time around we asked for rooms with separated bathroom, which were much more to our liking than the ones with modern aquarium-look shower cubical, inside the room.
The pool on the roof is tad exaggerated, as it is more like a fish tank. 
To summarize it all, this is a great place to stay in the old part of Barcelona, where you are assured of receiving special attention and every assistance to make your stay more pleasant.",4,2015,09,28
23,Modern in an ancient city,"Kudos to the Ohla Hotel for
•  a clean, well-lit room layout with ample luggage space. Spacious sink area separate from the toilet. We loved the white armoire for visibility and organized storage.
•  same-day laundry service
•  bi-lingual labeled breakfast buffet items with made-to order hot items
•  room key-swipe elevator security
•  professional and courteous breakfast, housekeeping and (most) concierge staff
•  room lighting card separate from room key
•  open-air roof lounge with pool and bar. Great panorama of the city up there, too.
•  quality toiletries with list of additional items available

points Docked for
•  mistaken phone call early our first morning, the (reception? concierge?) staffer insisting that the car (we never ordered) was ready and were we sure we didn't we need it.  Muchas gracias to the sweet buffet staffer later who kept double espressos coming until I was somewhat awake.
•  Crystal clear glass on both sides (including the bedroom side) of the shower. Awkward if occupants aren't adults in a relationship.  And sink lighting SHINES through the glass shower onto the bed at night.
•  reception staff never told us we needed a dinner reservation for the hotel restaurant the one night we asked about going there to save limited time before leaving.",4,2015,09,25
23,Something very special.,"We have just returned from a five night break at this beautiful hotel. Everything about it is 5 star. The service, cleanliness, friendliness, customer service are faultless.  The rooms are really comfortable and we loved the turn down service and chocolates left on our pillow every night. We also had breakfast and that again was perfect. So much to choose from that we were spoils for choice.  We were staying to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday so treated ourselves to a meal at Sauc which is a real fine dining experience and Las Plashola for tapas. Both perfect. We loved the terrace bar and the magnificent views over the city. If you like Mojitos well they are the best I've ever had. This Hotel is fantastic and we will definitely return in the future plus recommend it to all our family and friends.",5,2015,09,25
23,The terrace is fabulous for a drink at night ,"Came just to the terrace to have a drink with friends at night , the view is amazing you can see old towns ,  cathedral , tibidabo, motjuic . Try the Jamon tapas is very good and the Gin Gaudi cocktail , of course serves by very friendly personnel and the ""maestro jamonero""

23,Elegant boutique hotel,"This boutique hotel is centrally located. It has an attentive and friendly staff who helped make our stay successful. The room we had was very quirky with a glass enclosed shower in the middle of the room. It would not be within everyone's comfort zone. Putting that aside, our room was lovely and immaculate. There was a small but very comfortable pool on the roof with a small bar for drinks.  Talking of bars, there was a wonderful lounge off the lobby where an award winning bartender showed off his skill making the best mojito I ever had.  The Ohla also had a lovely restaurant where they served delicious and more than adequate buffet style breakfasts.  I would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2015,09,20
23,Beautiful Hotel,"Amazing hotel. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Breakfast to die for. Luxury mattress. Rooftop pool spectacular. Would definitely stay here again. Near all the shops, Rambles. 
Loved every minute of our stay.",5,2015,09,20
23,Excellent,"Modern. Beautiful. Wonderful staff...especially Jorge. The concierge folks could work a little bit on improving their local knowledge and on giving directions. Otherwise, simply superb. Cava delivered to our room as they saw our birthdates on our passports. Attentive and thoughtful.",5,2015,09,20
23,Most friendly and modern hotel,"This hotel earns every one of its 5 stars.  The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.  We had a room on the 1st floor and asked to be moved higher and the manager could not have been more accommodating, moving us the next day with no issues to the 6th floor.  We had room 611 which is a fantastic suite.
The breakfast is excellent and includes Cava!  The only minor disappointment is the eggs cooked to order which everyday were overcooked (fried egg was always hard on the bottom and dry).
The hotel location is brilliant.  For Gaudi fans, exit the hotel and cross the road at the lights, turn right and immediate right.  You are within 5 minutes of a Gaudi theatre!
Also crossing the same road are tow supermarkets so great for snacks.
The hotel rooftop is great but really a small plunge pool and only 12 loungers so get there early.  If crowded the beach is only 5-10 minutes by taxi which only costs 6 euros.  Actually taxis are incredibly cheap in Barcelona and from the hotel it is only 6 Euros to the Sagrada Familia which is a must see but has to be booked on-line for a time slot.
Also from the hotel you can walk 5 minutes to the main shopping arcade and the Cathedral.  If you visit the Cathedral to the left of the main altar there is a lift to the top for 3 Euros which is brilliant.  Open lookout across Barcelona!!  
This is a great hotel - rooms are really well maintained.  Showers are odd with no privacy but memorable!  Always clean, and the most friendly staff we have ever met in a hotel.  Nice touches also with the glass of Cava when you arrive.  
My final tip - do not order your leaving taxi via the concierge.  There are loads of taxis outside the hotel on the main road. We did book and when we got in the taxi he already had 10 Euros on the meter.  I asked him why and he was rude and said it was what it was and I had to pay this on top of the meter fee.  The hotel should really address this issue as after such a wonderful stay it was a shame to endure this",5,2015,09,19
23,Amazing,"Stylish, modern boutique hotel with some quirky touches. 

The staff are all friendly and helpful and keen to ensure you have a great time in their hotel. The food in both Sauc and the gastro bar is outstanding and the experience is enhanced again by the passion of the staff for catalan fare. The cocktail bar is outstanding, quiet, but more than made up for by the quality of the cocktails and the skilss of the mixologists.

Will most definitely return.",5,2015,09,18
23,Beautiful Hotel,"Aside from the concierges appearing to be rather inattentive, strange for such a nice hotel, we had a great stay.   Rooftop pool is very peaceful, though the drinks are the most expensive in all of Barcelona.   Overall a great time.",4,2015,09,17
23,"Great Hotel, fantastic staff","I've been very happy in this hotel since the day I arrived and for the four nights I stayed. The location is fantastic, rooms are beautiful, minimalist with very fine finishes and the staff in all areas of the hotel are really wonderful. The views from the swimming pool on the top floor were really amazing. The food in the hotel was incredible as well. Unfortunately I couldn´t eat at the other one Michelin star restaurant at the hotel as it was full.
I really recommend this hotel without blinking!",5,2015,09,17
23,Amazing time in Barcelona,"We had booked a BA package for a very reasonable price and were most (positively) surprised to end up in a 5 star hotel!
Our experience was fantastic right from the beginning and stayed like this until we left. The repeated complimentary Cava on ice was wonderful and a welcome refreshment after a long day exploring the city. The extra attention to celebrate my partner's special birthday. Great room, great view, very stylish. Very nice staff and the concierge team in particular were great (please on our thanks to them).
It made this birthday trip truly special and all was way above what we had hoped for.",5,2015,09,16
23,Good hotel but.....,"Visited in September. 
Great location. Very central. Staff attentive. 
Wouldn't say it was 5 star. Lacks atmosphere. Too clinical. Shower in bedroom is right in middle of room and leaves nothing to imagination. Rooms clean but not cosy. 
Feel there are better hotels. ",4,2015,09,16
23,"Great Location, Great Hotel","Great experience of the hotel, we were upgraded to a junior suite which was large and clean. Really nice location of the hotel, with a short walk to the sea front and Las Ramblas.  Really nice outdoor rooftop bar and pool with good views of the city.",4,2015,09,16
23,Wonderful hotel! ,"This hotel met our expectations. The staff was very nice and helpful throughout our visit. We ate at both restaurants which have the same chef, each giving us memorable meals. The location was good, about a mile walk to the beach which we enjoyed and right in the gothic quarter for shopping and eating options. The rooftop pool was awesome, a bit pricy for cocktails, but you know why when you see the view. The room we stayed at was the deluxe design which offered plenty of space and was cleaned very well each day. Overall if we make it back to Barcelona, we would stay at this hotel. ",5,2015,09,15
23,"Old Town, new Boutique","Opened in early 2011 and reviewed by the New York Times in early 2012, the Ohla Hotel is a chic, modern, boutique hotel on VIa Laietana, dividing the Gothic and Barri areas of the old city. It features a Michelin-star restaurant, a bar voted among the top 10 Bars of the World by the 2014 Drinks International Awards, and a decent tapas restaurant. The rooms are ergonomically modern with glass showers. I like visiting old towns but I like sleeping in modern style.
",4,2015,09,15
23,Enjoyable stay at the Ohla hotel,"We had an enjoyable stay at the Ohla hotel.  It was our Honeymoon and there was a bottle of Cava & chocolate waiting for us in the room when we arrived. The location was great, walking distance to El Gotic, La Rambla, El Born and the beach.  Our room was quiet and there was blackout curtains so it was nice and dark for sleeping.  Very clean modern rooms.",5,2015,09,13
23,Good but could do better,"We spent two nights at the Ohla Hotel in early September.  The location is fantastic; an easy walk to the seafront, Las Ramblas and Barri Gottic and right by a Metro station.  The room was a good size, stylish and not noisy.  The see-through shower may take some getting used to, but did make the room feel bigger.
Breakfast is an extensive and good quality buffet with a choice of a hot dish.  We ate one night in the main restaurant (at 11.30 pm having just arrived) and once in the Michelin starred Sauc. Sauc in many ways reflected the hotel overall. It was stylish and good quality but somethings didn't quite work. 
The main issue is the staff who seem to lack direction.  At Sauc the Maitre'd readily agreed to our request to amend a course on the set menu but then changed the wrong course.  On our last night at the hotel the bar was being used for a function and rather than move the arriving guests out of the way of reception they all milled around by the entrance where all the guests were also congregated, trying to use the alternate bar.
Overall we enjoyed the stay and would recommend the Ohla hotel but just feel they are a few steps from perfection.",4,2015,09,13
23,Nice Hotel,"A very nice Hotel in a nice accomondation. Close to placa cataluna, La Rambla aso. Lovely pool at the roof top, nice rooms with modern equipment, good price in relation to the service. The bar is one of the best in Barcelona!

I really recomend it!",5,2015,09,13
23,"Wonderful service, beautiful view","When we arrived at the Ohla Hotel we were on day 5 of traveling with no luggage as it had been lost by the airline. We showed up to this posh hotel looking quite ragged after having been up until the wee hours at a wedding in Malaga and after sleeping for 6 hours on the train with nothing but two carry-ons and two giant H&M bags that were serving as our temporary luggage and wardrobe. We were greeted warmly by the concierge and after explaining our luggage situation promised that they would take over calling the airline for us on a regular basis so that we could enjoy our visit. They also offered to help carry our H&M shopping bags and handed us two glasses of cava.

Our entire experience at the Ohla was delightful. The service is first class and the view from the rooftop pool is breathtaking. The interior is sleek and trendy without being pretentious. Before our arrival I received an email in preparation for our stay enquiring about the types of pillows and sheets we would most enjoy and any other services we might require. We enjoyed making grapefruit and cava mimosas at breakfast each morning and met some interesting people chatting with fellow guests at the pool lounge and breakfast. The concierge was very helpful in making recommendations for dinner for the one night we did not have reservations anywhere and ultimately we did receive our luggage on our final day in Barcelona.

I'm not sure if the concierge had anything to do with it (although I do love to entertain the idea that he pulled a Monsieur Gustav and gained the aid of the Crossed Keys Society to snatch our luggage from the grasp of the evil airline holding it hostage in Madrid) or if the airline finally came through, but all in all it was a cause for celebration and we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Ohla! I could sit at the pool drinking cava and staring at beautiful Barcelona all day.",5,2015,09,13
23,"Sleek, clean and a very helpful staff","Ohla Hotel is a modern, sleek hotel. The pre-arrival questionnaire on pillow selection baths, and extra activities heightened the experience.  The rooms are good size, beds extremely comfortable. One note of  caution, although the decor is beautiful, the bathrooms are part of the main room, the only separate area is for the toilet. Showers have glass doors and there is zero privacy to shower or change - a bit challenging if traveling with children.",5,2015,09,12
23,"Only Hotel, Barcelona","We stayed for five days at this hotel. When we arrived at the airport, the transfer arranged with the hotel had not arrived so we got a taxi from just outside the airport which was cheaper. The hotel apologised profusely and arranged our return transfer to the airport in a very nice car free of charge. The hotel staff were courteous and polite and the quality of cleanliness exceptionally high.
We would recommend this hotel for its staff and location in the centre of Barcelona ...
We didn't use the pool due to the inclement weather nor the restaurant so cannot comment on those ..
The mattress was a bit too firm but that is the only criticism that I have of this fine hotel ...",4,2015,09,12
23,highly recommended,"We had a very nice stay at the Ohla hotel, I would highly recommended. We are a couple of 33 years old without childeren so I can tell if it is a good hotel for childeren. In brief very nice staff, good food, clean rooms, nice bars and restaurants in the hotel and a swimming pool on the roof",5,2015,09,10
23,Mixed Experience,"We had a disappointing experience at the Ohla (Aug 2015) despite looking forward to it so much.  The hotel / rooms are very nice.  The staff overall is very courteous.  The beds/linens/bath towels are of nice quality.  The hotel is very accommodating.  One thing to note however is that the wifi coverage is extremely poor in the hotel.  Having said all of that, we had a terrible experience with the hotel concierge that, unfortunately, soured our entire stay.  Prior to our stay, we had asked the concierge to make a reservation for us at Sauc, the hotel's highly rated restaurant.  When we arrived the reservations had not been made, so we re-requested the reservations.  The next morning, we asked if we could cancel the reservations (as we felt that it would be too awkward to go there with our 5 year old son) but the concierge insisted that we needed to keep the reservations and that we would be charged if we did not show up.  The concierge claimed that we had ""signed"" a reservation form and that we had committed.  That evening, when all 6 of us arrived at the restaurant, the maître d' indicated that since we did not want the reservations, the hotel had cancelled them -- he said, that in fact, we had not signed the reservation form and did not have a commitment -- neither the concierge nor the restaurant had bothered to even let us know in advance by calling or leaving a message.  It was the most disrespectful thing that has ever happened to our family at any hotel we have ever frequented.  The hotel did not even offer to help us find alternative dinner plans.  Luckily, Barcelona is full of amazing restaurants and we found a lovely restaurant (Bocagrande which we recommend to readers, as well as Le Petit Comite).  That night, we asked that the general manager of the restaurant call us.  We also emailed them.  No response for two days. Finally, on the morning of our check out, the manager communicated an apology to my sister and said the only thing that they could do at this point was to ""comp"" our expenses.  If monetary compensation is in lieu of respect, I take respect any day and I say adios to the Ohla!",3,2015,09,02
23,Nice Hotel,"Very good hotel, room very clean, pleasant and nice modern showers. Great location for shopping.  Very good restaurants close by. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly.. Nice roof top restaurant and pool, the views are excellent, although the drinks were pricey.
I would definitely stay at this hotel again",5,2015,09,02
23,Hooneymooners enjoyed!,"This was the first place my new wife and I stayed at on our honeymoon. We were there from August 17th through the 21st. The hotel is in a stellar location, amenities were great and everything was what you could expect from an upscale boutique-ish hotel. The only down side, was that the pool was really more decorative than anything and we sort of had the idea in our heads that we'd be able to swim in it. Regardless, the rooftop was a blast, service was excellent and Pablo was extremely helpful in providing suggestions for a range of things to do.",4,2015,09,01
23,"Luxury, comfort, special, friendly, well located","This hotel offers nice, clean rooms, good breakfast, very friendly staff and excellent staff in the bar. Among the best drinks ever made with precision. Unique hotel in many ways and very well located close to Rambla and walking distance to the beach, I must to return! The roof top pool adds to the luxury expression and wellness!",5,2015,09,01
23,Fantastic hotel ,"We stayed at the Ohla Hotel from 28th August which is close to the beach and LA Ramblas. The hotel is amazing, fabulous facilities and friendly staff. The roof top pool was a definite highlight and the lady who worked up there was fantastic, extremely helpful and always available. The room cleanliness was great and the well air conditioned. I recommend a meal in The Sauc Restaurant, if you are looking for well presented dishes and romantic place to eat this would be the place. The whole team were very friendly and on hand at all times. Champagne is presented upon arrival whilst you check in and the make you feel very welcome. I will definitely visit again as the sights to see and things to do is endless. ",5,2015,08,31
23,Better when we moved room,"The Ohla hotel was a disappointing to begin with.  The initial room was small with the bed virtually on top of the shower.  After explaining this was not as expected for such a hotel we were moved twice and eventually they upgraded us to a junior suite and the room was very spacious with a very nice bathroom.  We booked through Mr and Mrs Smith and a bottle of complementary cava was delivered.  The room service was quick and efficient although day two they explained they had run out of English breakfast tea.  The pool was small but clean and the service around the pool was great.  The second time we went up to the pool we were disappointed to find no seats although many beds had towels obviously saved this should not be allowed in such a small area and the staff should remove items and free them up.

Please note the black marble stairs are quite dangerous  go carefully!!

The staff were helpful and friendly at all times.",4,2015,08,30
23,Celebrating in Style!,"Had a lovely break at this hotel celebrating in style my sister-in-laws birthday with her family.  We had two adjoining rooms on the 5th floor which was great!
The hotel is centrally situated for ease of touring the city, shopping and the beach. The staff are so friendly and helpful, it was so welcoming on our arrival to have a glass of cava or two!  The concierge staff went out of their way to help in whatever we asked them.

The breakfast was in the downstairs restaurant - we found it quite chaotic - running out of cups and slow in filling up the continental selection.  The hot cooked option had poached eggs which are not like ""our"" poached eggs at all so beware - they were cold and very runny however the omelets and boiled eggs were fine.

The rooftop pool was lovely but there are not many sunbeds or chairs available as it is quite small but the little booths were excellent to sit at for an evening drink.

We loved this hotel and definitely would love to return.  Highly recommended.",4,2015,08,28
23,"Amazing Location, Great staff","We stayed here for 4 nights, we arrived around 1am and the service from the night staff was amazing, they were very quick and efficient as we were exhausted. The rooms are beautiful and with a cool layout. We had breakfast included but only had the hot meal once as the continental buffet was amazing, especially the fruits and juices.

Concierge services were extremely helpful and gave us great recommendations on where to eat, shop and what to see in the city. The hotel is located in a great area where everything is right around the corner or a very short taxi ride away.

The rooftop pool was amazing, the pool although deceptively cold has an amazing glass wall that still lets you see the great views the roof has to offer. 

We cant wait to come back to Barcelona and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,28
23,An oasis of calm in the heart of a beautiful city ,"Just returned from a fabulous 3 night break at the Ohla hotel. The hotel is situated in the heart of the city and in easy reach of all the main tourist sites and walking distance to most & the beach. The city feels so vibrant and friendly and the hotel is the perfect place to relax after a day out. The concierge service was very professional and helpful. The check-in staff were very welcoming and friendly and the glass of cava upon arrival was a very nice touch.
The roof top bar/pool area was the perfect place for an early evening drink whilst taking in the views of the fabulous city below. 
Thank you to all staff at the Ohla for making our stay with you so perfect x",5,2015,08,27
23,Great hotel. Amazing location.,"You can't get a better and location in Barcelona. Close to the beach and in the heart of the city.
The staff is amazing and the service is great.
Rooms are modern and spacious.
Great boutique hotel. Just perfect!!!!",5,2015,08,22
23,Fantastic location. Classy hotel.,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights to celebrate my 30th birthday. We paid for a junior suite in the third floor which was very spacious and comfortable. The only negative was the constant flow of traffic past the hotel which was very noisy and affected our quality of sleep. The hotel itself though is very stylish in a perfect location in the centre of Barcelona. It's only a few minutes walking distance away from the beautiful Cathedral and 5 minutes away from La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter. We would like to highly praise the hotel for its staff, especially the concierges, who are very professional, helpful, respectful and highly trained. We would like to thank concierge Mathieu in particular whom we found very helpful after we were let down by our airport private transfer.
Breakfast is situated in the restaurant with a decent continental selection. We would, however, have preferred a larger choice of cooked options.
The rooftop pool and terrace sports a stunning view overlooking the Cathedral. 
We would highly recommend this hotel and you will not be disappointed with your stay here.",5,2015,08,22
23,"Great location, quiet but walkable","My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience.  Our flight was delayed and we didn't end up getting in until 1:00 AM.  As soon as we got there we were welcomed with open arms, a glass of champagne, and a jar of marshmallows.  They even gave us a room upgrade and amenity which was very sweet of them!

The entry is all black but with pops of color and modern design.  On the exterior of the building, there are ""eyeballs"" popping out all of the place. The rooms are very sleek and stylish and the beds are comfortable.  The fitness room is large enough to get a good vacation work out in.

Breakfast was located in their restaurant on the lobby floor and had a normal amount of options.  You have the opportunity to order 1 hot item from a small menu per person.  This was perfect for my husband and I, as we knew we would be eating tapas around the city all day.

There is a small pool area on the top deck with a bar and an amazing view.

The hotel is right across from a performing arts center and about 2 main streets away from Las Ramblas.  Very easy to walk to, but far enough removed so you don't have to deal with the crowds or noise.  

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling to Barcelona.",5,2015,08,21
23,Amazing. Great luxury at a good price,"Perfect. Everybody should at some time spend a little bit extra to experience some luxury. The rooms and service is great - you will not be dissapointed when choosing Ohla, and the price is fine.
In general, the location is perfect for a typical stay in Barcelona with short walking distance to all main things and attractions you typically want to experience.
We had absolutely nothing to complaint about, and we've spent several holidays in Barcelona by now.",5,2015,08,20
23,Superb,"The Ohla Hotel sits in a great position in the heart of Barcelona, within easy walk to shops, cafes and the harbour. The service is first class and from the moment we were collected at the airport, we could not have been looked after better. 
The room was everything we had been expecting and was very clean and comfortable. 
The rooftop pool and terrace is worth staying at the hotel for alone! Rooftop bar, views and great seating.",5,2015,08,18
23,"Perfect location, amazing service and a roof top pool to die for!","I loved this hotel from the moment we stepped in. The location was perfect - very central which is what we needed as were only in Barcelona for 2 nights as we were on a time constrained trip. The glass of cava offered on check in was much needed and the service from the staff only improved from there! The concierge was extremely helpful in finding us what we needed in the short time we were there. The room was perfect, very clean, minimalist, the shower was amazing - it was everything you would expect from a boutique hotel of this calibre. We asked for a room high up (were given 6th floor) to avoid the potential noise of traffic and this was perfect - I am a light sleeper but had no troubles. But really the best part of this hotel for me was the rooftop pool and bar with views overlooking Barcelona. If I didn't love Barcelona so much (and want to get out and about) I would have happily stayed at the rooftop pool for our entire stay!",5,2015,08,17
23,Memorable,"I went to Ohla with a good friend whilst in Barcelona. It was an exquisite experience, and one I recommend without reservation.
We enjoyed the Tasting Menu with wine. It was superbly designed, and delivered perfectly by both chef and an attentive and friendly waiting staff, who knew what they were talking about.",5,2015,08,15
23,Never to be forgotten,"Barcelona was our first stop on a six week holiday, we had never been to Spain and were also celebrating my husbands 60th birthday, so this hotel needed to be very special. It did not let us down. After booking this hotel I was in touch with the staff via email so we could make the most of our 4 night stay. They arranged for us to be met at the airport on our arrival into Barcelona by a driver with a limousine and a four hour tour of Barcelona prior to checking into the hotel. Kevin, the driver was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave us a really good insight of the city. This tour is highly recommended and as we arrived in the morning it seemed a better use of our time than waiting for a room to be ready. On arrival at the hotel we were checked in and had a fabulous room (Junior Suite) it was spacious and modern with a very comfortable bed and pillows. The breakfast buffet was very good with hot dishes to order. The day after arrival was my husbands birthday and through the hotel we had arranged for a private guide for the day. Our guide was Ramon, he is a very articulate, clever and witty man who is passionate about his city. We spent six hours with him on a walking tour of the old city and had a fantastic day. We started the day by sitting down at a table in the hotel and talking about what our interests were so he could take us to places that suited our interests. We were not disappointed and saw many places we would never have seen on our own. On return to the hotel we went to the chill out lounge which is a roof top bar next to the swimming pool and has fabulous views over Barcelona. In fact I think we utilized the chill out lounge everyday, it was such a relaxing place. In the evening we went to Sauc restaurant and ate at the ""kitchen table"" which overlooks the kitchen so you can watch the chefs at work. A fantastic experience that is highly recommended. Our stay at the Ohla is never to be forgotten and a huge thanks go to all the very friendly and helpful staff who helped to make our stay so special.",5,2015,08,15
23,Beware of the black stairs!😭,"The staff and concierge were friendly and welcoming. We had a road facing room on the second floor but did not find any problems with street noise. However, the huge glass box shower in the middle of the room was strange and ruined the ambience of the room. This is not a very relaxing enviroment in which to be taking a shower with impromptu housekeeping visits. The roof terrace was lovely but the seating not practical with three large private cabanas usually only seating two people and some random chairs positioned on the edge of the pool.  The pool was small and similar to the glass box shower design!  By far, the most alarming thing about this Hotel are the black stairs. BEWARE. These stairs are very dangerous and not very well lit. I am still bruised and my ankle swollen ( post 3 weeks) from falling at the top of the first staircase. There are no lights at the top two or bottom two stairs. I hope this hotel takes action before someone is very seriously hurt on these stairs.  The black walls, black marble stairs are impractical and unsafe. Style over practicality and safety seems to be the hotel theme.",3,2015,08,14
23,Couples only,"A smart but unusual hotel.  Stayed here with our two children (daugher of 21 and son of 19) who were horrified to be shown to a double room - despite having requested adjoining rooms and specifically that one of the two rooms booked should be a twin.  The glass shower in the middle of the room also took some getting used to, despite the fact that I had read about it on the website.  Booked hotel and flights through BA.com. The hotel were able to move the younger members of our party to a twin room with more traditional ensuite and we were also moved to one floor above them which we were assured were of the same standard - but I am not so sure and think we were fobbed of at best.  Typically the hotel prices for drinks were astronomical, which is a real shame as we would have made more use of the hotel facilities had the prices been reasonable.  The rooftop terrace was tiny but having said that we were able to find a space for each of the 4 days we visited.  Lovely Claudia at the bar was always welcoming and cheerful, such that were seduced into ordering her refreshing Sangria in spite of the premium paid!  The hotel's in a lovely location, great for exploring this vibrant city and wasn't too noisy for sleeping.  The breakfast is adequate but we did not experience either of the restaurants opting instead to search out others in the area of which there is an overwhelming choice - would definitely recommend El Milagrito just a 5 minute walk away which is friendly and very reasonable.",4,2015,08,13
23,Great choice,"Very good, modern hotel with the best facilities and good location for visiting the city.
The rooms are big, with large, modern bathrooms. The breakfast has a large selection.
The hotel bar is great, lots of tasty cocktails!",5,2015,08,13
23,Excellent hotel,"The rooms are unique and modern with the setup of the shower/bathroom.  The rooftop has an amazing view, during both daytime pool hours and bar hours at night.  The bar on the first floor has some amazing cocktails.  While pricey, they are almost like a mixture of art and cocktail.  We wished we had gone before our last night so we could have tried more.  The included breakfast was good, and the service throughout the hotel was excellent.  We stayed for our first anniversary and they put a bottle of cava in the room for us, which was a nice touch.  The hotel wasn't cheap, but you get what you pay for.  A very nice hotel in a great location in the city.",5,2015,08,12
23,Great hotel,"Just came back and everything was spot on. The breakfast food was great but we didn't try the proper restaurant. The roof pool and lounging area is really nice, with the bar staff taking orders from your sunbed it's easy to lose a few hours and get burnt! Room service kept the room perfect, staff were all very friendly and the concierges know their stuff. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,08,11
23,Could not have asked for a better location and considerate staff.,Loved this hotel. It is close to any place worth visiting in Barcelona. We were a little disappointed with our room and were upgraded with no charge. Very attentive staff. We would definitely return to Hotel Ohla.,5,2015,08,10
23,"Perfect location; modern, functional rooms; impeccable service.","We spent four nights at Ohla on our honeymoon, and we had a fabulous experience.  The service was very helpful, the rooms were very cool and modern, quiet and had a comfortable bed (with our choice of scented sheets no less!).  The rooftop pool, bar and chill out area were a perfect place to unwind after walking and biking around Barcelona.  Finally, the location is great.  Close to Born (which was our favorite), Gothic, Eixample and a 15 minute walk to the beach.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona.",5,2015,08,09
23,"Good hotel, but not 5 stars","Hotel is good, but is from my point of view not a 5 star hotel.
We didn't receive the room which we ordered, road in front is pretty noisy but location is very central and in an interesting area of the city.

The restaurant Sauc is on the other side excellent.",3,2015,08,09
23,"Great rooms, service and location",The rooms are great. The staff was very helpful. Any assistance you need they help you with. Breakfast is included and good. Housekeeping keeps everything clean. Room service was good. The location is centrally located and we were able to walk to many places or take a short taxi ride.  The taxis are not expensive. there are many good restaurants within easy travel distance. We were there the last week of July 2015,5,2015,08,08
23,***** Boutique hotel ,"Title says it all, convenient, nice rooms, great service - the whole staff was helpful.  It is the best area of Barcelona for sightseeing - the whole gothic district is great.  Never to far to walk for a great restaurant and the harbor is a quick 15 minute walk down the street.",5,2015,08,08
23,Simply fantastic!,"It was my first time in Europe so it was quite a challenge to find a hotel and i struck gold!  This hotel was above and beyond anything i could have hoped for!  it was absolutely perfect!  The location was ideal, the room was very modern and comfortable and the staff - they just couldn't be more accomodating!  In particular, i would like to thank Daniel who happened to always be around to help with directions and our luggage and countless other requests that came up on our visit.   We loved Barcelona and will stay here again for our return visit!",5,2015,08,07
23,Ohla hotel Barcelona ,"Very impressed with the hotel The staff could not do enough for you 100% recommend this hotel. Great loaction easy access to the sites of the city 
The pool on the roof is a lovely place to finish off the day 

Will definitely be coming back to this hotel  ",5,2015,08,05
23,Relaxing and peaceful stay in central Barcelona,"We stayed at the Ohla for 3 nights and it was the most luxurious hotel we have ever stayed in.  The service is impeccable; on arrival we were greeted with three friendly faces at reception - one automatically took our luggage and got us a glass of cava each which was very welcome after our flight!  The reception staff was amazing throughout our stay, they booked tickets for us online, gave us a metro map with directions and recommendations of where to go.  There was even a space for us to print out our boarding passes.

The room was nice, the bedding was out of this world and the room was very clean (we had two turndowns a day!!). They also provide a weather report for the next day and a little chocolate during evening turndown.  Free wifi the room was very well received and worked at a good speed.  Breakfast in the morning was tasty with a great deal of choice.  A lovely spread of fruit, pastries, meats, breads, cheeses, yoghurts as well as a hot menu you can order from.  (Just make sure you take your own tea bags!)

The location of the hotel is amazing with a metro stop directly outside and a short five minute to Catalunya Square where most metro lines run through and many shops and restaurants lie.  I would highly recommend using the metro - we got a two day ticket and made great use of it.

The most impressive aspect of the hotel was the rooftop pool.  The views are breathtaking and a very relaxing place to drink/ read a book / swim or sunbathe.  We used the pool early in the morning and it was very quiet.  We returned later in the afternoon and it was very busy, a little difficult to get a sun lounger.  I have read that drinks can be expensive in the rooftop pool but you get what you pay for, 5 euros for a glass of beer in a relaxing space with beautiful views I think is reasonable.  If you get the chance to stay at this hotel, you have to go to the pool!

Overall, this hotel made this trip for us, it was modern, relaxing and the staff were very attentive.",5,2015,08,02
23,"Perfect Boutique Hotel, Perfect Central Location","The Ohla Hotel was a super quaint boutique hotel. The staff was fantastic, above and beyond helpful. We were treated the same by every staff member of the hotel. It is a relatively new, modern hotel. High end design with open glass shower, sort of in the middle of the room, (not my favorite thing). The roof top was lovely, very comfortable seating, and a tranquil place to relax. Definitely recommend this hotel, comfortable, nice and not super expensive, great place to stay.

 .",5,2015,08,01
23,"Fantastic place to stay, they made you feel so welcome","This was my first non-business trip to Barcelona and staying at this hotel will make it very memorable. The staff are so attentive without being over bearing and the concierge was excellent and explained everything well. The roof-top pool is amazing and we spent time there every day. The breakfast food was a feast for the eyes as well as the palette with a great selection of fresh fruit and wonderful cheeses as well as cooked breakfast if you wished it.

Over all a perfect sanctuary which we will return to.",5,2015,08,01
23,Luxury centrally located hotel,Great centrally located hotel although a little on the expensive side when comparing with other 5* hotels.  Whilst it has a Mitchelin Star restaurant the hotel does not offer general amenities such as lounge where guests can sit and relax. and the breakfast can get a little boring and can also be expensive if you want additional items not normally included in the hot breakfast extras.  The pool is also quite small and requires a little updating,4,2015,07,31
23,sensational boutique hotel in awesome spot,Excellent amenities and overall chic spot. The Suite Dome room is epic and a great surprise find. The pool rocks and all staff are quite nice. I'd recommend it if you want to stay in mid-Barcelona. Walking distance to many of the best spots.,5,2015,07,29
23,Amazing!!,"Loved Ohla - from the service, to the rooms, the attention to detail and the pool overlooking Barcelona. Everything worked very well and they went the extra mile in adding value to the experience. Cannot wait to come back.",5,2015,07,28
23,"Overall, great experience.","The staff is great. Concierge was very helpful. Great location and centrally located.the rooms are a little small, but very clean. All glass shower a little weird, as you cannot open door to room, while someone is showering. Very nice breakfast included.",4,2015,07,28
23,"Couldn't recommend this hotel more, Fantastic!","We just returned from a week in Barcelona. The Ohla hotel made our trip just that little bit more special. 

The location was perfect just a 20 minute drive from the airport and a short walk to plenty popular locations! (including the beach) 

The staff at the hotel could not have done more to make us feel welcome and assist where ever they could! 

The roof top bar and pool is really something to see and enjoy, with some spectacular views and lovely cocktails!

I genuinely would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona, as it will only be the cherry on top of a fantastic holiday!",5,2015,07,27
23,Great Location,"This is a difficult review and I feel bad ruining a series of 5 star ratings from previous reviews, but like to be honest.

The hotel has many plus points, so I will start with them:
Strong Wifi
Fantastic location. It is a few minutes walk to the square and shops and a short taxi to the beach.
It is very modern and cool looking.  
The room is spotless and trendy, with a glass shower in the middle (ish) which is funky - I hope you feel comfortable around your company!
The staff are generally friendly and helpful and professional.
Rooftop bar and pool looks great.

Not so positives:
There were often no staff downstairs on the concierge when we needed assistance (booking something, getting a taxi etc).  In fact one time I personally helped a lady and her many suitcases up the the next floor where reception is as there was no one to help her. When staff were there they appeared to be under staffed and so you would have to wait a long time while they dealt with other customers.

We also found we couldn't always reach reception on the phone, sometimes it would just ring.  This was really annoying especially when we were just about to jump in the shower and run out to a reservation to find out house keeping had not left us any towels!  When you do get through to someone they are very polite and send someone up.

My room was on the 1st floor and situated next to the housekeeping room.  On the Saturday morning I was woken up numerous times by people (or possibly one person) going in and out of that room and making noise.  I woke up very grumpy!

You are encouraged to get your own taxi, which is very easy to hail, but no easy to communicate with if they don't speak English.  When I asked for help getting a taxi I was told ""it is very easy just go outside"".  

The pool closes at 18:30 even though it's hot and sunny until much later.

So to summarise I was a bit disappointed.  I am being super critical and as I always stay in 5 star on my travels so I have quite high standards I am comparing it to (oh my god I sound like Mariah Carey lol).  Essentially this is a good hotel, but lacking the 5 star feel I have experienced elsewhere.  I do however believe they are trying their best and really want to make this a great hotel and experience.  I think most issues could be resolved if they had more staff.",4,2015,07,27
23,Everything you would need,In the middle of everything this modern hotel has great service and attentive staff. The rooms are a bit small but more the enough to be comfortable. The staff has been great in making reservations and making recommendations of places to see and visit. Have not tried the hotel restaurants yet.,5,2015,07,26
23,Our Favorite Hotel from our 9 Flight Trip,"Hotel Ohla is a terrific boutique hotel in a great location.  It's a five minute walk to Placa la Catalunya (a major metro hub and where you can catch the on-off site-seeing bus).  Even closer, is Place Urquinaona Metro Station and between the two of them you have access to all the metro lines.  Fun dining and decent shopping is close by as well.  (More on this later).  

The rooms are well thought out.  Not the largest rooms to be sure, but with the high ceilings and masterful design, the lack of square footage is a non-issue.  One switch by the bed turns on tiny lights for that nighttime visit to the washroom including a small light behind the hidden door of the toilet.  Take it from someone that often is on the road 48 weeks a year.  These rooms are well thought out.  

The rooftop pool offers a stunning view of the Cathedral as well as a southern view toward the harbor.  I can understand the comments that the pool space is not large enough for the number of deck chairs needed, but for us, this was a non-issue during our stay.  

I like the concierge services.  This is service with an attitude as they will suggest better options than you might have thought of.  For example, when my wife wanted to do the local shopping, the concierge suggested that he wish he could just wish it away, never to be seen again and suggested better shopping areas.  For example when he heard we were going to Parc Guell in the morning, he suggested walking downhill from the park to shopping areas below.  These featured smaller boutiques and one-of-kind shops versus the usual stuff along the bigger boulevards.

Breakfast is very good, try the pancakes ... heavenly with the fruit that comes with it among confectionery sugar.     

We also had a late flight so we checked out with many hours before heading for the airport.  The staff suggested that we make a full day of it and offered the showers in their health club area, as needed.  So, we we shopped and then went to the beach and used their showers.  This was a much appreciated option and factor that got Hotel Ohla its 5th star from me.",5,2015,07,25
23,Beautiful property and great location!,Great location! Walking distance from all the major sites; Concierge were extremely helpful with directions and dinner recommendations; Bar in the hotel and on the rooftop were great! Shower in center of room was interesting.  Great property!,5,2015,07,24
23,"Location, Location, Cocktails","This hotel is perfectly located on Via Laietana between the Gothic and El Born neighborhoods, around the corner from Placa la Catalunya, and across the street from a Metro stop and the Palau Musica.  You can walk almost everywhere.

Facilities were great - the rooftop pool is spectacular, and I did not experience the seating issues others have mentioned.  The hotel gym is also decent, and there is a computer and printer available if you need to print train tickets or the like.  

The hotel breakfast was excellent, and tapas in the main-floor restaurant were good (but not as good as I remembered from a prior visit).  There is also a very good fine dining option in the property, although I did not partake.  The real star of the show on this front is the cocktail lounge.  Do yourself a favor and have one of the world's best cocktail teams whip you up something special.

Hotel staff were excellent from check in, through dealing with an issue with the room, and through check out.

So why not 5 stars?  Two reasons.  One was the room issue.  It was quite hot in Barcelona during my stay so that may have had something to do with it, but as the days progressed there was an increasingly bad smell coming from the drains or somewhere.  I requested a room change that they were able to accommodate (and did with absolutely class and no hassle, which was very much appreciated).  That room didn't have the smell, but as it was on the first floor facing Via Laietana there was some street noise and the rumble of the subway every few minutes was not overly restful. Thankfully I was only there one night so not a huge issue, but if you are staying here you should try to book a room on a higher floor and off of Via Laietana.

The second reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is this was the 3rd similar hotel I've stayed at in BCN over the past 12 months, and I would recommend one of the others before coming back to the Ohla.  If that other hotel was booked up though I wouldn't have an issue coming back to the Ohla, so long as I could get a quieter room.  And I will definitely visit the cocktail lounge every time I'm in town.

All in all this is a good option on Barcelona.",4,2015,07,23
23,End of our honeymoon ,"We are currently on our last day/night stay at this hotel. Our room is lovely and clean, and the bed is really comfortable. The walls are not soundproof and you can hear everything going on outside the room. Disappointed with the facilities for a 5* hotel, we got ready to go up to the rooftop pool/bar and there were no seats, and the staff just said 'sorry'. There was no offer to seat us elsewhere or make room for us. Given the fact we are in Spain and would like to sunbath and have a dip in the pool we are highly disappointed. We are on honeymoon and disappointed that we aren't getting to relax as we had hoped. ",3,2015,07,22
23,Modern European Hotel,"Good location easy walk to Las Ramblas, Gothic, and other tourist areas.  Friendly efficient staff.  Expensive hotel with unexpected overpriced amenities, (paid E3.00 for a glass of water at roof top bar after ordering a drink).  Roof top area with infinity pool, cabanas and bar was a relaxing area with wonderful views of the city.",4,2015,07,20
23,"Great property, great staff, great food!",Ohla is a great find. The rooms are cleverly designed -- the glassed-in shower gives the illusion of more space and is very cool.  The rooftop pool is a great place for a break from touristing -- bar and snack options there are very good. Tip: Get to the pool by 3pm or so if you want to chair.  The casual tapas bar downstairs - Passohla -- is outstanding. Best meal we had in Barcelona.  The staff is very helpful.  We'll be back.,5,2015,07,20
23,Just Perfect,"4 great days at the Ohla! Extremely comfortable, well located, relaxed and superb service. If you are looking for a great hotel in a superb location with great helpful staff then this won't disappoint. The concierge staff were extremely helpful and pointed us in the right direction on more than one occasion with regards to taxis, eating out etc. You truly feel like nothing is too much bother and we definitely received 5 star service! Great breakfast, superb roof terrace, we will certainly stay here again!",5,2015,07,19
23,Brilliantly modern in the old town,"We spent Easter weekend here and absolutely loved everything about this hotel. Located centrally in the old district it is within walking distance of much of the shopping district - La Ramblas is 5min walk away. Gaudis Casa Mila and La Pedrera are also nearby and Sagrade Familia is a bit further but still walkable if you don't mind stretching your legs. The hotel is modern and stylish, rooms are slick and modern - central glass shower and black granite all round. Without a doubt the most stunning and surprising feature is the open air roof top pool and deck, what a treat and the views across the rooftops toward the harbour area are fantastic. The in house restaurant at ground level offered  the most delicious breakfasts with buffet and cooked as only the Spanish can do. Worth every cent and we will always come back if ever in Barcelona again!",5,2015,07,18
23,So relaxing,"5 blissful days.  Such a great location and for such an 'aggressively trendy' hotel it was delightful to find no 'attitude' - just amazingly welcoming and helpful staff.  The rooms were immaculate, very quiet (most unexpected given the location on a busy street) and the pool was a haven from the midday heat and perfect for pre/after dinner drinks.",5,2015,07,16
23,weekend visit,"Ohla was welcoming (with a glass of fizz) as soon as we entered the hotel. The staff could not have been more attentive to our needs during our 3 night stay. Our room was clean and comfortable. We were on the 3rd floor and could just about hear the rumble of the metro but this didn't disturb our sleep. The pool terrace was lovely, very relaxing (although people wanting to swim lengths instead of just cool down might struggle here) On our 2nd night, myself and my husband had a cocktail masterclass- I understood it at first that we would actually be doing some cocktail shaking etc, but we had a teaching session and were given recipes- it was interesting and more importantly the cocktails were delicious! Try the Maluta Mojito (chocolate infused Mojito) The location of the hotel was good. Not far from the main square, les ramblas, or the gothic quarter which was pretty.We would totally recommend this hotel- the only negative I could find was that the stairs are really badly lit- this could cause risk of injury to older customers.
Barcelona tips- Hold bags across your body/backpacks over your front- We were told Barcelona was really bad for pickpockets but we were absolutely fine-probably cos we looked like we had taken precautuions, Also we visited les ramblas early in the morning. It was no where near as crowded as it gets later in the day.
use the hop on/off bus tour to get around and see the sights.
Nou Camp stadium was a good tour and the view from the Mnap museum is great. 
we really enjoyed the Olympic port and the relaxing bars around there.",5,2015,07,15
23,Luxurious hotel in a great location,"The hotel is perfectly located, the staff was very helpful and the room was great. Breakfast was excellent, too. It's close to all the nice places in old town Barcelona, and the area is very silent at night.

We were unable to make use of the pool, which closes at 18:30 and is extremely small. It was the only disappointment of our stay.

All in all, really great place, possibly on the expensive side of things, even a luxury hotel in Barcelona in Summer.",4,2015,07,12
23,"Magnificent hotel, amazing staff and perfect location!","I just returned from a week's stay in Barcelona at Hotel Ohla.  It was one of the best hotel's I have ever stayed in.  The location, staff, amenities and the hotel itself are just beyond amazing!  It is truly a 5 star boutique hotel, depending on your taste, it is possible it may not be for you (ie: the shower in the bathroom...look at their website).  I thought it was super cool and loved it.  They offer a great buffet breakfast with your stay,  Upon arrival, if your room is not ready they have a very nice, relaxing lounge for you to chill out, have coffee, champagne some fruit etc.  
The Concierge staff is just as great with wonderful suggestions of what to do/not to do and places to eat.
I loved it and so sad to be home!  I almost cried when I was saying goodbye!",5,2015,07,11
23,Almost perfect,"There are two outstanding reason to stay at the Ohla - the location and the delicious pas at their restaurant. Then rooms are modern and comfortable, ours had a beautiful view of the Via Lantana... The roof top bar/pool is a bit cramped and gets crowded very easily. But overall, this is a wonderful place to stay while visiting Barcelona.",4,2015,07,11
23,Great Place,"Stayed 3 nights in June.  A great location near El Born neighborhood.  Close to Las Ramblas but I would recommend skipping that area due to warnings about being pick pocketed.  The hotel itself has very nice rooms, two great restaurants and one of the best cocktail bars in the world.  The cocktails are a can't miss item, even if you don't stay here come to the bar and try one of the cocktails, they are unlike anything I've ever had, truly a work of art.  The rooftop pool is also spectacular and a great place to party in the afternoon.  I would highly recommend this hotel and it is a great value.",5,2015,07,11
23,"Superb Hotel, Perfect Location and Perfect Service","We have just returned from a lovely stay at the Ohla Hotel. This hotel is centrally placed for sightseeing. It is a short walk from Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas and was really easy to get to from the airport without the need for taxis...you just take the Aerobus from the airport terminal (pre-book your return bus tickets online) The bus stops in Placa Catalunya.
On arrival, we were greeted warmly and given information and a map of the city. We had a deluxe room which was really comfortable. We had a choice of pillows and also a chosen room fragrance. Bed linen and towels were changed every day. There was also a turn down service with chocolates on our pillows each evening which was lovely after a days sightseeing. Fabulous shower and good air conditioning. The cleanliness of the room was immaculate.. One thing I found  though was that the bathroom lighting was not good for applying make up. I would have preferred a mirror above the desk to sit at. There was free WiFi which was fast. The soundproofing unfortunately does not entirely block out those few 'noisy disrespectful guests.
Breakfast was included in our stay and this was excellent. Such a large choice and served by such polite and speedy waiting staff.
The concierge service was amazing. Their knowledge and willingness to help was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble or beyond their remit. Even sending for maintenance to fix my daughter's broken sunglasses ! 
The rooftop pool was really relaxing with great views of the old town and a bar service. The bar is open to all at night until 1am. Hotel guests have a private seating area. 
We did not eat at  lunchtime, or in the evening, in the restaurants, but the menu looked really good. The gym was spacious and well equipped.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would certainly stay here again if returning to visit Barcelona. This hotel is the best choice for service, luxury and its location.",5,2015,07,10
23,Wonderful hotel,We have just returned from a two day break in Barcelona and the staff at the Ohla Hotel could not have made it more special.  Not only did they give us a wonderfully warm welcome but they also gave us a free bottle of cava to celebrate our anniversary.  The location is fantastic for exploring the city and the rooftop swimming pool is a little oasis overlooking the rooftops of Barcelona. It is very centrally located so you would expect some city noise but it was very well soundproofed so we had no trouble sleeping. I would definitely stay here again for the facilities and the location but it was the staff who made it extra special.,5,2015,07,10
23,The shortest yet finest stop on our trip,"As we pulled up in the taxi a whole group came to relieve us of our bags and immediately greeted us and took us upstairs for private check in . After over 2 weeks of travelling this greeting was a nice change . The rooms are modern ,comfortable , and very sexy with 3 glass shower walls viewed into the bedroom ,not for the shy ones . The rooftop bar and pool with surrounding chill out couches are wonderful for relaxing ,viewing the city from above. The design of the hotel throughout is fun and whimsical . The exterior of this classic architectural building is covered with large eyeballs all over as you look at the building it looks back at you . Breakfast buffet was great as well . This hotel is a must stop in Barcelona    ",5,2015,07,10
23,A Modern Enthusiast Dream,"Conveniently located in Central Barcelona is this lovely modern hotel. The room boasted a very minimal design with very clean lines. We both love modern design and this hotel really made it shine. Bed was medium firm and the breakfast was good. Best part is the hotel bar downstairs, it has some of the best craft cocktails we've ever had.",4,2015,07,09
23,The Total Package,"We had about a 36 hour layover in Barcelona after a cruise, and the Ohla Hotel really took care of us... Arranged to pick us up at the ship, conduct a 4 hour highlight of the city, put us up in a great room, had a Michelin star restaurant on property and took us to the airport --- all in grand style and at a reasonable price. So convenient and so service oriented.It is located in the center of the city in a great location near the cathedral. Rooms are very contemporary and the pool on the top floor has a great view of the entire city. When we return to Barcelona, there is no question we will go back to Ohla!",5,2015,07,08
23,Very Modern Design,Interesting modern boutique hotel in great location.  Shower is glass in center of room. Walls are completely black - must push on wall for bathroom door to open. Actually kind of cool. Located in center of everything with several neighborhoods nearby. Excellent service. Everything needed/wanted within walking distance. ,4,2015,07,05
23,Fab hotel ,"This is a fabulous hotel in the centre of Barcelona. The rooms and pool were amazing.  The staff couldn't do enough for us, especially the lady who served round the pool. The food and drinks were great , breakfast was lovely too. I can not recommend this hotel enough!",5,2015,07,05
23,Overnight stay in Barcelona,"The room was very sleek and modern. The shower, while nice and large, lacked a step to put your leg up on for shaving. This made things rather difficult. The bathroom isn't very well lit.

The rooftop pool was comfortably warm and the bar service from Claudia was excellent. 

The elevator was slower than molasses and we ended up taking the stairs several times. The stairway is black marble with black walls and very little lighting. It was rather difficult to see well and could have been dangerous for someone with poor vision or mobility issues.

The location was great for us as we just walked toward the port and viewed wonderful sights all along the way. While the street seems very busy, we didn't hear any of the road noise in our room. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful.

We had to leave too early to take advantage of the free breakfast which started at 7:30 in the morning.",4,2015,07,04
23,Great hotel but...,"I really liked this hotel; the rooms, the rooftop, the breakfast. However, the things that can be improved are:
-The Wifi is horrible! It doesn't load anything. I ran a speed test and it was 0.50 Mbps. 
-The pool can be a little bigger, but it's really nice as it has see-through glass. 

That's it really, I really liked the Spanish hospitality and the kind staff and it was an overall great experience. ",3,2015,07,03
23,A great hotel in the center of Barcelona,"Stayed her one my last business trip to Barcelona. Great hotel with a realy nice pool on the roof. Great room with a nice bed. They had a great brakfast and i heard the the resturant is realy good, but diden't have time to try it out.",5,2015,07,02
23,Great hotel perfect location,We received a wonderful welcome. The service from then on was excellent. The roof top is an absolute delight and cocktails on the roof terrace is a must when visiting this hotel. Everything about this hotel is excellent with the exception of two very minors points. The lift is very slow and the staircase is to dark. This hotel played a very big part in our enjoying our stay in Barcelona especially with it being in a perfect location.,5,2015,07,02
23,Great Oasis in Barcelona,"We only had a couple of days in Barcelona, but the Ohla made them great.  Extremely personable and welcoming reception (David) and very helpful concierge (several of them).  The room was great, the rooftop pool and deck were a great place to enjoy during the day, and relax at night.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,07,01
23,Glad we chose the Ohla Hotel,"This is a modernized old hotel in the old section of Barcelona, which is where you want to be. Hotels by the sea or in ""new"" Barcelona will lack the charm as well as the proximity to great authentic restaurants and tapas bars. 
Walk out the hotel front door and in any directions are narrow streets lined with little cafes, non-touristy specialty shops, and the coziest drinking establishments and genuine Catalan cuisine. 
Easily within walking distance of all major attractions. We had room 601, right next to the elevator, but we heard no noise from it at all. 
Hint: ask for a room that faces ""inward"" to avoid the possibility of hearing street noise. 
The concierge service was excellent and promptly attended to our every need. A very nice breakfast buffet was included with our room and the hotel has an intimate bar with great views for people watching as well as two other restaurants, including the critically acclaimed Sauc Restaurant. 
There is free wifi in every room and throughout the the hotel. Nice toiletries for the shower and the rainfall shower head makes for a most relaxing shower.",4,2015,07,01
23,Hola!,"Stag do (a reserved one) from Friday to Sunday and what a lovely spot. Staff are excellent and the location great. The rooms are splendid. Great response from the staff and big, modern facilities. The rooftop pool and bar were excellent and special commendation to Claudia our Italian roof bartender. I'd stay here again. A little surprised by prices but that was our fault not the hotels. We didn't take full advantage - I didn't eat here nor did I use the gym - but I have a feeling they would have been great. Bravo.

23,Best hotel ever stayed in!,Excellent service. Excellent breakfast including cava and selection of hot food to order and a cold buffet. Excellent staff particularly the concierge who helped us book tickets to avoid the huge queues for attractions. Roof top pool bar and chill out zone amazing! Would definitely recommend the tapas restaurant. Excellent location to explore Barcelona. Would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of a trip to Barcelona.,5,2015,06,30
23,Amazing hotel!,"The first thing a 5 star hotel has is fabulous staff - Ohla Hotel has the best staff imaginable! Very helpful, always asking to help, quietly being there to assist. Next the room - modern and unique! We were there for 3 nights - the bathroom and shower sits two steps above the sleeping area - with the shower enclosed in clear glass on three sides - quite interesting use of space!  Very comfortable king-sized bed.  Great location - walking to anything in center of town.",5,2015,06,30
23,One night stopover,"Very good hotel, modern and trendy, and staff were all extremely friendly and welcoming. Stayed in a junior suite that was very stylish and well furnished. The rooftop terrace had good views and also doubled as a bar area after the (small) pool closed. The buffet breakfast was plentiful and very tasty. Location is great, just outside Urquinoana tube station so very well connected to the rest of the city.",4,2015,06,28
23,Beautiful boutique hotel in great Gothic Quarter location,"If you are looking for a great boutique hotel in the heart of Gothic Quarter close to the sites and plenty of good restaurants, look no further!  Hotel not only appealing on the exterior, but the experience carries into the luxury suites and top notch service.",5,2015,06,28
23,Just perfect !,"We stayed at the ohla hotel for 2 days . A week before our stay, Jorge was already in contact with us to help us plan our stay with the hotel. Location was great. Steps from the gothic quarter and plenty of restaurants around. We tried the tasting menu at the sauc restaurant and let me tell you the food was amazing! Our room was well maintained in the morning and in the evening. Most comfortable bed ever! I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,06,23
23,Perfect!,"Ohla Hotel is by far one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.  As soon as we arrived our cases were taken off us and we were shown to reception where we were offered (and duly accepted!) a glass of Spanish Cava.  We had requested a quiet room and this is what we were given - perfect! The breakfast buffet was lovely - especially as you could help yourself to even more cava - never seen that at any other buffet breakfast.  Excellent way to start the day!  We would like to mention in particular, Matthew and Pablo on the front desk who were so helpful, polite and friendly.  We stayed for 4 nights and there is not a single negative comment to make.  We would definitely return to this excellent hotel.  Thank you to all the staff for making our first trip to Barcelona so enjoyable.",5,2015,06,22
23,Good location,"This is a very comfortable hotel, very modern.  The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable.  We had a  breakfast included, which was more than adequate.  We could walk to most of the places we wanted to see.",5,2015,06,22
23,Ohla was pleasant surprise.,"We had just left a Tauck Tour so for 2 weeks we had stayed in the best 5 star hotels in Spain.  We booked a separate trip at the Ohla in Barcelona based on location and reviews in TripAdvisor.  We lucked out.  Great small boutique hotel in best possible location for us with personal service of Albert, the chief concierge.  He even crossed the street with us to get a cab to ensure we'd be going in the right direction.",5,2015,06,21
23,Honest feedback for you.,"Very good location between high end shopping district and the old part of town.
Some excellent employees that really care. Most so in the restaurant.
Rooms are pretty good but stay in the back away from the noise.
Seriously lacking management. 
Elevators are a complete disaster. You will see if you go.
Bar rooftop is nice but the rules are a complete pain. After long days of seeing the city all you want to do is relax and get some sun. They always kick you out at 6 when there is sun until 9. They seem to always be setting up for some sort of party and don't treat guest nicely or even allow them to get a drink at the bar. Very frustrating.
You can ask the concierge for things but know you will get ripped off. My experience had to do with a taxi for our check out. We needed to go 100km south of the hotel. They wanted to charge us 300 euros when the actual driver outside was quoting 140. The denied it till the end so I ended up calling a taxi from the pace we were going to. They sent a perfectly nice Mercedes van for 140. The concierge still denied that they were wrong.
Over all it was good and there were some very nice employees. The hotel just lacks client focus and management.",3,2015,06,21
23,Excellent,"This is a conveniently located boutique hotel. It is comfortable with an attractive rooftop bar and small swimming pool. Lovely to relax at the end of the day. Breakfast is plentiful and varied with a cooked option. Staff are without exception friendly and very helpful, I would particularly mention the concierge service which was excellent. Barcelona is a great city to visit, staying at the Ohla added to our enjoyment.",5,2015,06,21
23,Sexiest hotel in Spain,"What a great hotel, 
Location is couldn't be more perfect, you are minutes away from most beautiful streets La Ramble, Columbus Square, not far from the public beach and Old Port, there are many great restaurants and cafes perfect for both: lunch dinners or just glass of cava while siesta after sightseeing! Great nightlife, the city  around  is live 24/7! 
The area is full of nice shops museums and antiques stores! 
The hotel itself is stunning, rooms are light sexy with cool black walls and see through showers, roof top pool has tremendous views and just the best spot for a sunset watch! 
Breakfast offered by Ohla Hotel is beyond satisfying, fresh cold and hot dishes, very lavish and tasty! 
Service is impeccable from arriving till leaving, you will feel like a royalty 
My favorite hotel in the whole Spain, one of the best in Europe, will stay there again in a heartbeat!
Salut!! 
 ",5,2015,06,21
23,Excellent hotel and location,"This hotel is very well situated and you can reach all the sights in short time. Definitely a very good choice and we would come back for sure. We had a Junior Suite and it was very comfortable. Breakfast was also nice and they make good omelettes. Friendly staff, especially Helene on the reception. She gave us very good tips on our arrival and explained everything about the hotel and the city. She answered promptly my emails and she made us feel welcome. We also got a cava as welcome drink - nice ! We recommend this hotel ! There is also a rooftop bar with a pool and a wonderful view, don't miss this view !",5,2015,06,20
23,Amazing,"I loved it, the rooms were cool. The showers are interesting! The staff were phenomenal, the concierge were the most helpful I've ever met! Really I couldn't be more complimentary about all the staff!
The one draw back is the pool closes a bit early, but maybe I'm alone in wanting to have a dip at midnight! - On the subject of the pool simply wow, that roof is so nice I could (and have) spent all day up there.",5,2015,06,20
23,Brilliant location and services,"This hotel is a sophisticated quiet haven in the center of the city close to the cathedral. It has great noise insulation in the rooms, and then you can top that with the splendor of its rooftop bar pool and eating area with great views around the city. Excellent restaurant and tapas, superb welcome and offers of help. Small yet perfectly formed.",5,2015,06,19
23,Classy all the way,"We wanted to stay somewhere luxurious on this trip and we want edit to be in the heart of the city. Hotel Ohla is right in the gothic area - perfect for seeing the old sites. 
We've stayed in 5 star hotels before and been a bit disappointed but this hotel is exactly as it was described. They say in their description about themselves that they pay attention to detail - and they do. We had a junior suite and I cannot fault it. The decoration, the layout, the ambiance, the temperature - everything is perfect.
We arrived and were taken to the concierge to check-in. He gave us some cava and we chatted about our journey. He gave us all the details of the hotel and really made us feel welcome. We were soon taken to our our room and given a little tour. All good!
Although it's a 5 star hotel the staff are not stuck up. They even put up with my spanish! 
The breakfast is wonderful! Croissants, pan au chocolat, bread, cold meats, fruit, yoghurt, cereal, granola and they will cook you one thing from the menu eg:omelette etc, tea, coffee and various juices are available too. One thing to watch for is that the hot milk is UHT, not fresh. If you want fresh use the cold milk by the cereal.
Honestly, I cannot fault our stay here.",5,2015,06,19
23,Lovely hotel but not my fav part of town,"We spent one night here before heading out to Lisbon and it was great. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of space. We were right off the elevator so a bit noisy at night but I didn't mind too much....The breakfast (included) was perfect as well! The only downside is that we asked the concierge for food recommendations and he didn't really have anything offhand (isn't that their job?). He pointed to the water and said to walk down a ways and there would be a good restaurant. He didn't know the name so not sure if we were at the right place but whenever we went wasn't great. Little did we know we could have walked north or taken a quick cab ride to decliousness! I think it's too close to the water (but if that's your thing that's cool) and La Rambla, although a fun scene, not where I want to stay....",4,2015,06,18
23,Wonderful valentines break,"We stayed in February for Valentine's Day and what can I say - wow. My boyfriend had arranged for rose petals all over the room and a lovely bath run which was such a lovely touch. The room was incredibly spacious and comfortable (we had a junior suite). The hotel were more than happy to arrange everything for us before we arrived. We attended a cocktail making class which was really interesting although it was slightly disappointing that we couldn't make any ourselves. The hotel is in a gorgeous location in the gothic centre and a lot of places within walking distance. The photos of the pool are cleverly taken as it's very small so in the summer just be warned you may be cramped. The breakfast was lovely and plentiful, but I can't say about dinner as we ate out both nights. We bought a ticket to get into the sagrada familia at the hotel which I can't reccomend enough, we were in within 10 minutes whilst others queued for 3 hours for a ticket! A lovely hotel in great location",5,2015,06,14
23,Superb on every level,"My concierge service booked me in here when I told them I wanted a 5 star hotel in great location with a secure garage.

The cost was low and the value was superb. I would have happily paid double what I was charged. The garage was accessed to the right of hotel entrance by driving over pavement and pressing button on intercom. The gate was opened remotely, I drove through to find a lift….drove into lift, which took me to car park where I was met by a member of staff who assisted me.

The Wi-Fi worked perfectly.

This is an immaculate and very smart hotel with superb rooms. Everything was really very good indeed. Very highly recommended. I stayed two nights for a rest while driving from UK to Spain.",5,2015,06,13
23,Brilliant stay,"Expensive but worth every penny if you're looking for a treat. Service was amazing from the minute I booked till we arrived.
Room was large, but beware of the slightly strange shower set up.
All in all a perfect treat for a getaway. 
Ps try the little crepe cafe just down the street for breakfast, you won't be disappointed.",4,2015,06,12
23,Perfect stay,Loved the hotel. Perfect situation. In walking distance from most popular places and amazing restaurants. Loved the room. The pool was superb and lovely way to spend latter part of afternoons. Cocktail bar was great and breakfast was delicious. Great selection and great coffee. Highly recommend ,5,2015,06,11
23,Great Stay!,"Great location, only a block from the Metro station.  Rooms were large, including bathroom.  Fully enclosed shower - only one on our trip.  Service was excellent.  We ate in their highly rated restaurant.  Very expensive, but worth the money.  Beautiful rooftop pool and bar with great views of Barcelona.  Excellent cocktail bar off the lobby.  I'm generally a beer drinker, but even I tried two different award-winning cocktails.  Again, the cocktails were expensive, but worth it.  I would definitely stay at Ohla again.",5,2015,06,09
23,I thought it was better...,We went to the Plassohla and it was ok. We had a reservation and the hostess was really nice but once we sat down we waited for quite a long time to get the menus and it wasn't crowded. The portions were quite small but the food wasn't bad. ,3,2015,06,09
23,Hotel well lived it's reputation,"On a suggestion made from my friend and after researching about the hotel I decided to make booking there for 3 nights on a vacation.  As our flight was scheduled in morning,  I requested for an early check in, which was assured subject to availability.  I also requested for vegetarian breakfast for my wife as she vegan due to choice and religion,  which as well was assured by the hotel. Our check in was smooth,  with a welcome drink of cava -  Spanish sparkling wine,  which I enjoyed. While our room was being done up,  we checked their terrace on 8th floor. The view from the terrace are breath taking as it offers captivating skyline of historic Barcelona. Our room was located on 3rd floor and faced the inner courtyard -  so no scenic view but was quite and comfortable. The bed was comfortable to sleep with no annoying noise from the room or the street. Room amenities were top of the line, house keeping as well room service were prompt. Right from the reception to concierge desk and breakfast room staff were helpful. Only disappointment was vegetarian breakfast which hardly had any choice other then bread and cut fruits. The location of the hotel is superb,  all major Barcelona attractions within walking distance. ",5,2015,06,08
23,Great Everything!,"Made to feel special the moment of arrival. Whisked up to check in,had nice cold cava or wine while sitting checking in. We had flight delay so it had been a long day. Hotel is very nice and classy. The rooms are comfy and clean. Great bed! Breakfast outstanding! Best breakfast from our European trip. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful. Had a nice lounge, where bartender made exquisite drinks. That was an experience to watch, and drink! Great location. Close to las Ramblas while passing some great stores! Save room for shoes! ",5,2015,06,08
23,"Ohla, Barcelona",Our 2nd visit this year and once again it was amazing!!!  Fantastic hotel in a truly beautiful location cannot wait for our next visit. Absolutely perfect for chilling & relaxing whilst having a cocktail in hand.  Stunning city that will keep you going back for more 😉,5,2015,06,07
23,A fine example of how to run a hotel,"We can not recall a hotel where the staff were more helpful - everything was done to make our stay a comfortable, pleasant experience. The facilities are very good, the food is first class ( the Sauc Restaurant especially so), and the rooftop bar is a welcome oasis after a day's sightseeing. The location is superb for accessing most of the key locations in this beautiful city and the advice offered by the concierge staff was excellent. Highly recommended.",5,2015,06,06
23,Amazing Boutique Hotel,"Ohla is what all boutique hotels should be! Nice and modern rooms. Great staff. Trending atmosphere. My wife and I liked it a lot! The pool in the last floor is fantastic, all glass and a very nice bar - the view is awesome! The hotel is located in the Gothic neighborhood, with a metro station 50m away and walking distance from all major tourist attractions. Great spring experience in Barcelona! We'll be back. 

Helpful tips:

Wi-Fi is free, but not great.

Breakfast is included, but don't expect great variety.

There is a starred Michelin restaurant in the hotel, but I cannot advise once I don't care for this type of place.",5,2015,06,02
23,Great location!,"We stayed here in June 2014, and it's location was perfect! We found ourselves walking a lot to different attractions in Barcelona, and at times we were tired and took a pit stop back at the hotel, made possible thanks to it's central location. The rooms itself are decently sized for Europe and decorated quite modernly although I wouldn't say it's luxurious. The shower is in the middle of the room, this was OK for us because we are a couple.

Staff were very friendly and warm. 

Do check out the hazelnut molten lava cake at their Gastrobar (if they still make it) - it's delicious!",4,2015,05,31
23,Great location,"We have been in Barcelona several times before and every time we visit, we chose another hotel and location to explore a bit more.
I found this part of the city the most romantic and the nicest. I really enjoy small streets, plenty of tapas bars and this joyful atmosphere all around. 
It is a short walk to La Rambla, Cathedral, Barceloneta, Passeig de Gracia, Placa de Catalunya.
The building itself is very nice and interesting. There is a rooftop bar and small pool and you can really enjoy afternoon or evening drink up there.
We have booked Deluxe Design room with Via Laietana view and got 5th floor. The windows are soundproof and there is no problem with the street noise. 
I wish the window can open, so you get the chance to soak up this vibrant atmosphere. 
The room is nice with the shower in the middle of the room which my husband and I found great. 
You have all the amenities and everything is very clean.
Breakfast was just ok, but I think that 5* hotel should do the breakfast little bit better.
Reception staff was very polite and helpful. They are doing very good job!
All in all, this hotel was a good find and I would recommend it to all travelers looking for great location!",5,2015,05,29
23,GREAT  STAY,"we stayed here for three nights and had a very nice time. we stayed in a junior suite which had plenty of room and was very clean , at night when they had turn down service some times you had to call to have it done,to get fresh towels.the gym was o.k. but it would have been nice if you could have pluged in head phones to hear the t.v. rather than read the sub title.we went up to the pool which look very inviting the only problem there were no more seats. breakfast was fresh and good and a very nice choice of every thing. we ate at SAUC restaurant the food was good the service was way too slow. the hotel is very near a great deal of the sights and easy to walk to. the staff were very nice the concierge was very helpful and sent us to a very good restaurant  BOTAFUMEIRO i would stay there when we go back",4,2015,05,28
23,CENTRAL HOTEL WITH A ROOFTOP,"This Hotel is a super find and right in the heart of the city near to everything. We arrived before the normal check-in time and were warmly welcomed with a bottle of fizz and given a super suite on the 2nd floor, really loved the room, modern and clean with great bulgari amenities.

This hotel has a great roof top terrace with small compact pool ideal for sun bathing and taking in the city skyscape. The only shame was that the roof bar closed at 6pm and there were still people up there, I think it would be a good idea to gauge each day depending on weather and people present to keep this bar open and also serve cocktails up here, as well as in the fabulous albeit small lobby bar area, which had a great award winning cocktail menu. Although at times the drinks in the lobby took a little time as there was only one person serving at certain times.

Breakfast was good with a good choice of fresh juices and healthy options too. However, I would of like to have seen a more imaginative hot menu, which should have included scrabbled eggs, Spanish omelets, eggs benedict eggs, eggs Florentine etc. We were not actually introduced to the breakfast menu and just discovered it by chance. Staff need to also be much more vigilant and attentive at breakfast, plates were running out and things required me to ask to have replenished. This needs to be much more efficient operation here with an ‘eye for keeping the detail right’ at all times rather than me directing the staff to do things, clear table and refill coffee etc.

The only downside of the hotel is that having two similar styled restaurants was a mistake, tapas and then tapas with a one Michelin star this is too much, keep the Michelin restaurant but the ground floor restaurant needs to have an international brasserie flavor with more international European flair hence on the second and third night we ate out as the menu needed more scope.

Overall well done a well-executed hotel that would recommend, perfect for a city break without the overt excesses of the W Hotel and the hotel Art also visited during our stay.",4,2015,05,27
23,"Excellent Stay, Gorgeous and Spacious Suite","We really enjoyed our 5 day stay in Barcelona at Ohla Hotel.  We wanted something local that wasn't American (W, Marriott, etc).  The suite was very large and the shower, while open, was behind a wall for privacy.  The toilet was hidden within the wall in it's own commode.  

The service was 5 star and the hotel was within walking distance to all of the parks and touristy places (Las Ramblas), high end shopping (LV, Gucci), and non- touristy, more local places (Santa Marina and Princessa St.) and of course the many museums and churches.        

We did not eat at the restaurants but the food looked amazing.  We did go to the rooftop pool one afternoon and the sangria was incredible and it was neat to see how the locals live from the rooftop views of other apartments/ flats.

The only thing I wished the windows would open for fresh air and to experience the street below.

I would highly recommend Ohla Hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,26
23,"Great location, very helpful staff, lovely rooms.","Great location right in the centre of everything and even easy walk of the marina and beach.  Rooms very nicely styled and bed extremely comfy. Roof top terrace is lovely - though the food menu in the terrace bar is pretty limited. The continental breakfast is good though we Brits would have liked bigger portions for the cooked option, and a non sugary cereal would have been nice.  One small complaint was the wifi speed in the rooms was very slow - but we didn't go on holiday for wifi!  Overall though a lovely hotel and the perfect spot from which to explore the city.",5,2015,05,26
23,Awesome,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel. Rarely have I enjoyed a stay more than this. Great staff, awesome breakfast, lovely cocktail bar. Reception, concierge, in fact all staff could not be more helpful.
Our room was modern, super comfortable and had everything we could think of. The turn down service was a treat. With the shower in the middle of the room it's not great if sharing with a less than close friend but that's the nearest I can come to a negative in any area at all.
The rooftop bar is fabulous and the pool, not large but lovely, is a amazing. Very refreshing to swim with such an fantastic view. 
Apart from the excellent breakfast, we didn't eat in the hotel but took advice from the concierge and enjoyed amazing meals within 5 minutes walk of the hotel.
This hotel is 2 minutes' walk from the gothic quarter, 5 minutes walk from the square to catch the excellent sightseeing buses - and it's absolutely first class in every way.",5,2015,05,25
23,Stunning Hotel and Friendly Staff,"An entirely positive experience with Ohla Hotel! There was everything promised - welcoming staff, bed turning service in the evening, complimentary drinks on arrival and a comfortable waiting room which does provide complimentary juices, tea, coffee and croissants. The rooftop terrace with the pool and the cabana style couches are marvellous and it really does get quite warm when the sun comes out. Perfect for sun bathing. The pool is not heated, but no doubt after a month of strong heat it would be perfect! We were situated on Level 5 and it provided sound sleeping. I would assume being on lower levels would be quite noisy. The hotel is smack bang in the city centre - go figure. No complaints for our end and the hotel is quite stunning and the staff are dressed quite smartly in black attire and they are always around for any request or question. I would holiday in this hotel again. A relaxing experience.",5,2015,05,23
23,Fantastic break ,"I have just stayed at the Ohla Hotel. We throughly enjoyed our visit. The staff were really helpful, friendly and kind. We booked for our wedding anniversary la sace restaurant which didn't disappoint. Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends. Great location right in the centre too. ",5,2015,05,23
23,Perfect position!,"Cannot fault Ohla Hotel, their staff, food, room, location... All perfect. Had an amazing break blessed with great weather, will definitely be returning not just for the hotel but for all we couldn't fit in to the four days we spent in Barcelona, Ohla is the perfect place to see it all. ",5,2015,05,22
23,Best Staff in Barcelona!,Stayed three nights and were treated like royalty by all of the staff.  The roof top pool was a wonderful spot for us to host some friends staying at other hotels.  Our friends were all envious and will certainly be booking at Ohla Hotel next time!  Beautiful spot in a great location with exceptional service!,5,2015,05,20
23,A Flying Visit,"We have just returned home from a brief stay at the Ohla Hotel. Our experience was entirely positive. Great polite helpful staff. The room which was a twin with my son was very comfortable. SKY TV, Free Wifi, quality shower and bed. 
We did not get the oppertunity to eat there other than for breakfast which was good 

I would have no hesitation in recommending Ohla Hotel for business or pleasure 

The sun deck and pool are small but great and well staffed",5,2015,05,19
23,right in the middle of it all...,"this trendy ""5"" Star hotel is located right in the center of Barcelona and you can reach most of the attractions by foot. 

The building itself is spectacular!

The rooms are quite fancy and the modern open bathroom style might not suit everyone considering that the open glass shower is more or less in the middle of the room with no cover, however, I liked it and I had a good night of sleep.

Event though I consider 36,- Euro parking fee for the night as a rip off, it is the same I have paid at the Hyatt in Hamburg recently; so I take it as a standard in European Cities, but it is still an awful lot of money to park you car for a night!",5,2015,05,19
23,Amazing! Best hotel in Barcelona!,"Stayed for 2 nights in early May. Staff were amazing, genuine and went above and beyond. Rooms amazing quality. Perfect location. If went back to barcelona would go again without a doubt! 
Concierge staff were exceptional.",5,2015,05,18
23,Very enjoyable stay,"The location of the hotel was ideal, being very near to the airport bus terminus in town. Only a short walk from La Rambla, and other attractions. The hotel staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.The concierge service was invaluable, booking tickets and thereby saving us time and effort. Also very helpful in flagging down taxis. They were very knowledgeable about anything we asked them. 
The rooftop pool was much smaller in reality than we had expected from viewing the photographs. Also its temperature was too low for a comfortable dip. The windows of our room did not open, as it was in the older part of the building. This is our only criticism as everything else was excellent, including the breakfast.",4,2015,05,17
23,Our sceond visit to the Ohla!,"I would just like to say, ""Thank you to the entire staff at the Ohla"". My wife and I stayed at your wonderful hotel Two years ago and thought it was fantastic then. Upon our return in May 2015, we were pleasantly surprised that the property had in fact, improved, our stay was even nicer than the first visit. We cannot recommend the ""Ohla"" enough, you will not be disappointed in any way. Whether the staff, food, room, or the overall cleanliness of the entire property. Also, very good location to the Ramblas. Fantastic!",5,2015,05,16
23,Amazing Hotel,"I can not rate this hotel enough. The hotel staff are excellent, helpful and so knowledgeable. The cleanliness of the hotel is second to none and the food is amazing. 

The pool terrace bar is idyllic and the customer service is impeccable. 

We will definitely be visiting again. Thank you for such an amazing stay.",5,2015,05,15
23,An excellent boutique Hotel,"Love this place. Location, room, bathroom, quietness, staff, cleanliness were all to a high standard. The room design was nice because its a little unusual but in a very pleasing way. This is no ordinary hotel and is well worth considering if you are fed up with bog standard international chain hotels. The most memorable part of the experience was the breakfasts which were outstanding as all hot food was cooked to order and well prepared. A super, super, super hotel. If you go once then probably like me you will want to go again.",5,2015,05,14
23,Fantastic ,"This hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of many attractions, and is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in a long time. The staff are friendly and very helpful and went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed our stay. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,05,10
23,Great Hotel,"Eight of us stayed at the Ohla for 3 nights 29/4/15 - 2/5/15.  The hotel is lovely, rooms are very clean and staff very helpful and friendly.  The concierge know their stuff and were happy to recommend places to eat etc and to make bookings for the group.    Also, the tourist bus service is well worth booking.We would always stay here on future visits. L&KMc UK",5,2015,05,10
23,Great experience,"I would highly recommend the Ohla hotel. Brilliant location. Great service in the hotel. Especially the concierge who are extremely helpful in making sure you get the best from your trip. We had a fabulous room. Very spacious and comfortable, with all the ameneties you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The hotel is very modern and stylish. Pool and roof top terrace are a lovely feature. Food was great. The hotel made our visit to Barcelona really very special.",5,2015,05,09
23,"Great location and styling, perfect restaurant and great breakfast!","Stayed in ohla hotel 4 nights. Location is very central. Not far from El born, Barrio gotico, barceloneta and eixample. The gastrobar on the groundfloor at the hotel is really great. Tapas modern style and very tastefull. Also breakfast is very good and enough choices. Great Plus for the hotel is the Rooftop terras with cosy pool. Good for relaxing at the end of the day. There is a good conciërge service at the hotel. They can advise you about restaurants or other activities. They can also make your reservations. Rooms are not big, but good equiped and good styling. I would absolutely stay here again.",4,2015,05,08
23,An Excellent Introduction to Barcelona,"We were a party of 7. There were 3 married couples and a friend. I had chosen the Ohla from its website. As they say, ""what you see is what you get"". The website looks great. The hotel is great. Great people (very friendly and efficient), great food (breakfast and tapas were the best), great bar (try a Martini made with Tanguerey 10), great location (very close to the waterfront and La Rambla), great rooms and baths (large and modern), great décor (very contemporary, but, not uncomfortably modern nor eclectic).  We stayed there from April 22nd to April 25th, 2015, prior to a cruise. Everybody loved the place and I will recommend it to some friends who plan to travel to Barcelona in the early summer..",5,2015,05,06
23,Fantastic stay in Barcelona at the Ohla Hotel,"Superb hotel, centrally located in the heart of Barcelona. My wife and I stayed here to celebrate my birthday. What a gem. Rooms are well appointed and very clean, Staff very friendly and helpful, they really could not have done more to make this trip as enjoyable as it was. I would definitely recommend this hotel and visit again.",5,2015,05,04
23,"Location, Location, Location","First off, the location of this modern and inviting hotel, in the Barock sector of Barcelona is unbeatable, everything is in walking distance, from the most delicious restaurants to the nicest shops and sights of old Barcelona. You better like whom you are staying with in your room, as privacy during your shower will be non existent due to the shower being glass enclosed in your bedroom! Staff is most helpful and friendly, check in and out are expedient, and the concierge super helpful. Give him a nice little gift and he will guide you well to the places to go to. Breakfast buffet is ample and delicious. Free WiFii, great, I still can't understand why this service isn't included in all 4 and 5 star hotels without a surcharge nowadays. We weren't able to try the Michelin rated restaurant basically due to time constraints, but the menu read delectable. Will try it next time around. Rooftop bar and pool are nice, but get easily overcrowded on a nice day.",5,2015,05,02
23,First Class Service,"EXCELLENT. From the concierge at check in through to the girl in the cocktail bar. She kept our glasses full with perfect timing and her cocktails were superb. This hotel is worth a visit for the standard of the food, cocktails and the accommodation all in their own right. To have them all in such a perfect location is just fantastic. It may be expensive but this hotel is worth the price. The location is unbeatable and the rooftop pool and bar really are the icing on the cake. I cannot recommend highly enough. I will return ASAP!!!",5,2015,05,01
23,Ticks all the boxes!,"The service is excellent, the location is perfect and the rooftop pool area is the perfect place to relax. My partner and I were arrived here a little worse for wear after a stint in Ibiza, and we soon noted that this hotel had topped our list for the amount of times a room could be turned down. On one day the bed was remade 4 times! 
It's in a very central location, making it very easy to explore the city but also easy to not get too lost on the way back to your hotel. We spent a lot of time by the pool which had a fantastic view of the city. 
Also they do a fantastic breakfast spread! 
I would 100% stay here again. Couldn't have been happier with the experience.",5,2015,04,28
23,Great quality hotel in the centre of town,"Great location, delightful staff, lovely rooms and a rooftop terrace and pool with great views. Add in a top cocktail bar, sumptuous 1 star Michelin restaurant and you have a total experience that is really memorable in a buzzing, vibrant city.",5,2015,04,27
23,"Great, friendly hotel with fabulous restaurant","We stayed at Ohla Hotel for four days as part of a wedding. A very nice  and warm boutique hotel. Excellent and very friendly hotel staff! I had to arrange a number of events from across the Atlantic; everything went very smoothly without a hitch. Be sure to try the Sauc restaurant, great food. Nice centralized location. I would highly recommend it.",4,2015,04,26
23,Great hotel,"We visited Ohla Hotel last week as a party of 2 adults & 1 child, staying in a junior suite

The hotel itself Is in a great location. The room was very good if a little small with the extra fold up bed, but totally acceptable.

Cannot praise the staff enough. All were extremely friendly & helpful.
We were staying on a bed & breakfast basis, but did eat in the restaurant on one occasion.

The food was 100%, 

I've read a negative review regarding the breakfast, but cannot agree with this. The choice was more than adequate. The breakfast consists of pastries, fresh fruit, yogurts, continental cheeses & meats etc. they also offer a hot selection consisting of pancakes, waffles, eggs (poached, scrambled, fried or poached) with bacon, or sausage. All guests can choose one of the above, or if you want more than one, an additional charge of €4.00 applies. That does not seem unreasonable.
Cava, tea, coffee, every type of fresh fruit juice, hot chocolate, cappuccino etc also available at no extra cost.

The tapas selection in the main restaurant has a great selection of dishes with a great wine selection at very reasonable prices given the hotels location & clasification.

A special thanks to the guys on the concierge desk. This was the first time I've used a concierge before (always thinking they were on a commission for anything they recommend). They recommended a restaurant that we would never have found, phoned & booked a table & a taxi for us. Also booked tickets for an attraction so save us queuing.

Our room was at the front of the hotel, overlooking the main street & we heard no noise from the traffic.",5,2015,04,22
23,Surprised,"Ohla Hotel Barcellona.

Excellent hotel staff most attentive and pleasant. Boutique style with strange shower unit  which may not be to everybody's taste due to the fact it was in the bedroom area, with no privacy and in a glass cube however the room was immaculate every day. Be aware that the tea and biscuit array was expensive. Breakfast can be a bit hectic with too few staff trying to do too much. Superb Tapas Restaurant .Will be back.",5,2015,04,22
23,"Well located, luxury hotel","We chose to stay at Ohla Hotel, partly because of its location and we found it to be perfect for our short break in Barcelona.  We were able to easily walk to many key attractions (Las Ramblas, Barceloneta, Parc de la Ciutadella, Arc de Triomf, Casa Batllo, Casa Mila etc.) and it couldn't really be closer to a metro stop and buses from Placa Catalunya.  The beautiful Palau de la Musica Catalana is just around the corner and there are a few nice shops and places to eat nearby.  

We were also really impressed with friendly welcome, concierge service and check in.  Our room was clean, modern and well designed (if you like a feature shower!) and we loved the beautiful roof terrace with stunning views (although it was a little cold to use the pool in April!).  The breakfast buffet was fantastic (with Cava!) and we enjoyed the cooked options.  We also loved that breakfast continued to be served until 11am. 

On our last night, we ate at the hotel's restaurant, Souc, and enjoyed one of the best meals we have ever had (a la carte but with complementary courses!).

We can see that some people might not be happy with the noise from the road or, more noticeably, the metro and the wifi was rather slow but, overall,  we loved our stay at Ohla!",5,2015,04,21
23,Amazing cocktails,"Very impressed with the cocktails here and the service is wonderful.
We have visited the downstairs cocktail bar a few times now ,and it is certainly on our must do list when in Barcelona.
The barman has won cocktail mastery awards and the menu is so impressive and imaginative. Its difficult to choose which cocktail to go for, as they all sound amazing! 
Each is made with a great lot of thought and imagination. We also enjoyed the nuts to snack on. the staff are very friendly and helpful
Hopefully next time we can visit the roof garden.",5,2015,04,19
23,Location Location Location,"This was the second time staying at the Ohla Hotel and I will definitely stay here again. The location cannot be beat, with the Old City at your feet, a short walk to multiple shopping areas, including Las Rambla and an easy walk to the Maritime City area. The bus stop and subway is right outside the hotel, for easy access to further lying areas. The food is great at the hotel and the bar is a must! During our visit we had a young German lady that won an internship to work at the bar for 6 months, she was THE best bar tender/mixologist that we have ever encountered. The staff is very friendly, helpful and accommodating, making you feel welcome and looked after 24/7. The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The pool on the roof is beautiful and the views breathtaking! Thank you Ohla for making our stay perfect!",5,2015,04,13
23,Gorgeous hotel,"Lovely hotel! Great location, lovely staff, stylish decor. Too cold and windy to use the roof pool and bar but this would be amazing in the summer. The downstairs bar does fantastic cocktails. This is not a cheap hotel but I would say it is worth the money.",5,2015,04,08
23,Highly recommended,Everything was just perfect. Hotel is centrally located in the old part of BCN. Cool places and shops are just a short walking distance away. Service and rooms are excellent. Chill out at the bar with very special cocktails. And don't forget the rooftop bar. Great few over BCN. Will be back for sure.,5,2015,04,05
23,Nice modern hotel in fantastic location,"The moment we entered this hotel, the concierge greeted us with fantastic service. 

However, reception made an absolute balls of our check-in and the Male receptionist seemed more content with arguing rather than apologising and rectifying the situation. He was beyond tiresome. The Manager never left her office at all to rectify or apologise either, so our first taste of the hotel was completely soured. No one expects to book into a 5 star hotel and  be met with such badly trained staff. 2 females travelling together, and we repeatedly requested twin beds, but were provided twice with  rooms with a small double bed. 

6 hours later... when eventually rectified, we managed to check in - but most of our first day was lost at this stage. Our room was really modern and funky, if tiny - the shower area in the middle is great, however, not much privacy.Our room was an Executive Deluxe, and we overlooked a quiet street with lovely views which was a bonus. Beds were very comfortable.

Head of housekeeping Alicia (?) was excellent, and provided us with a late check in on the final day to make up for the mess when we arrived. it improved our opinion of the hotel.

Concierge desk is excellent. This is the real bonus of the hotel. They provided us with great suggestions, booked us into an amazing restaurant in the Hotel Des Arts, and booked trips. Very professional and friendly.

The Bar area downstairs is nice, and the rooftop pool is lovely. There is no bar on the rooftop though - we were led to believe there is a lively rooftop scene at night. If this is  what you are seeking, head to the W hotel at the Port.
Location of this hotel is excellent, close to La Rambla, Placa Catalunya, and El Born region where the locals go - A really  hip area of winding streets, well dressed locals, tapas bars, lovely shops.

Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, if you have a better check-in experience than we did... and I expect that was a once off. Be warned, rooms are very small, but the hotel design is very cool.",4,2015,04,01
23,Nice hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"Great hotel and perfectly located in the middle of Barcelona. Only a 5min walk to Plata De Catalunya where you can get the Tour buses and Aerobus (to and from Airport) and Las Ramblas which is always bustling. Surrounding streets have all the shops and a huge El Corte Ingles nearby. Across the road from the hotel is Urquinaona Metro station and some supermarkets and on the side is a street taking you to further shops. On arrival was provided some glasses of bubbly and checked in. Our room was not ready but offered drinks downstairs but opted to come back later. We had requested a room higher up which was provided which meant no noise at night and easy access to the rooftop terrace, pool and bar. Given early spring this was very quiet and was due to be closed for some further works. The room has all amenities as expected but with the shower smack bang in the middle. Not very obscure and can see this only appealing to couples but nonetheless the room was furnished to a high enough standard. Turndown service was provided with clothes laid out and a  chocolate on the pillow with notes of the next day weather which was a nice touch. Breakfast was well managed with enough choice and freshly cooked dishes. Overall I would recommend for a couple as the location is perfect – close enough but not too close and the services were excellent. The staff were attentive and also allowed a late check-out which meant we were never rushed.",5,2015,04,01
23,Nice 3-4* hotel with terrible 1* service,"The hotel is in a great central location and has nice, modern rooms. We had a Junior Suite Deluxe which was nice and spacious. Unfortunately those were the only positive factors...

Even though the Junior Suites Deluxe are nicely designed, do NOT book one unless you like the feeling of sleeping right next to a major highway. All Junior Suites Deluxe are corner rooms facing Via Laietana - a main road connecting the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes with the harbor area. The road has heavy traffic all day AND night. The windows of our room (just like other rooms as other guests confirmed) were so poorly soundproofed that it felt like the cars, motorcycles and trucks were driving right by our bed...

The service was the worst we have ever experienced at a 5* hotel. 
Totally understaffed at breakfast - with unfriendly staff that gives you the feeling that you are disturbing them when placing your order or asking for suggestions...
Breakfast includes only one ""warm"" dish such as eggs, pancakes, waffles. If you feel like having eggs AND pancakes, you will be charged extra - something I have NEVER experienced at any hotel, especially not a 5* hotel.

Housekeeping was bad as well. They did not replace empty bathroom amenities and left the old empty ones in the room. We did not get turndown service 2 of 4 nights even though we were explicitly asked by the receptionist whether we would want to have it. Water bottles were not replaced. The number of fresh towels placed in the room seemed random (1 or 2 floor mats; 2, 3, 4 or 5 bath towels...). 

Considering that we payed approx. 400 EUR per night for a room including breakfast, we expected not only to have a nice room but also good service. Unfortunately, we were wrong. I would absolutely NOT recommend this hotel. I am sure there are much better options in Barcelona",1,2015,03,30
23,Very nice hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"A very nice hotel located in the heart of Barcelona next to Plaça de Catalunya, el Barri Gotic and the Ciutat Vella. Top notch and friendly service. we had a superior room on the 4th floor and it was very quiet. The breakfast selection was excellent as were the taps and wine we had at the bar. The location of the shower is a bit funky what with it being located out in the open. So if you don't like having other people look at you while you shower, this is not for you.

I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for superior service in an extremely convenient location.",5,2015,03,25
23,Great place to stay,"We spent three night and it is a great hotel.  Location is perfect, rooms was very nice, breakfast was plentiful and tasty (best waffles ever), would stay there again.  I have to use 200 character so you do not have read this part.",5,2015,03,22
23,"Great location, wonderful staff","I spent 4 days at the Ohla Hotel during my first trip to Barcelona.  It is perfectly located for getting about Barcelona, and the concierge staff could not have been more helpful.  The rooms are indeed a bit unusual, with the glass showers in the middle of the room, but the untraditional decor was part of the fun of this hotel.  Good breakfast, nice day lounge with complementary coffee and juices, etc., and delicious cocktails at the bar in the evening.",5,2015,03,20
23,"Best rooftop view in the city, central location","I think a lot of people have already commented about the noise level in some of the rooms, situated in front of the busy Lei Leitana and above the metro which rumbles underground all day and night. It's really not that bad, and worth staying for the extremely central location, fantastic staff, particularly the concierges who made my stay so memorable. kudos to Daniel who managed to score fab restaurants every night. 
It's a hip hotel so it's designed to the nth degree,  you have to like that kind of design to enjoy the place. I find the shower in the middle of the room, with the missing floor mat a bit concerting as I don't like a wet floor. Housekeeping is not very consistent in replacing the floor mat after it gets wet either. 
But if you're prepared for all this, you will enjoy the location and the overall chic feel of this hotel. I will stay here  again since I now know how to navigate my way around the city and the maze of streets from here.",4,2015,03,19
23,Excellent Hotel,"Fabulous luxury hotel, Great facilities, Great Service and great location. 
We enjoyed a long weekend in early March, sightseeing, relaxing and grazing on Tapas. 
Great location for walking and getting about - there is an underground station just outside if you need to use it and one of the main train stations a short walk away. 
Breakfast was lovely. The cocktail bar is cosy with some very interesting cocktails, Jalapeno Margarita!
Rooftop Terrace offers fantastic views and warmer sunshine than the streets below, although the pool was still too cold for me 
We would recommend booking into the Michelin starred restaurant onsite - Sauc - we enjoyed the taster menu! 
The room was cosy and some lovely touches décor and finish, a few people comment regarding the noise, we were on the front of the hotel facing the road and didnt have any problem with noise. 
We would return.",5,2015,03,17
23,Nice design but bad insulation and no follow-up after request for room change,"Despite perfect location for exploring Barcelona, original design and friendly staff, the hotel is situated along a busy and noisy street and room insulation is not at all appropriate.
For a hotel claiming 5 stars and with room rates over 250 €, the level of noise in the rooms (superior room) due to the road traffic (day and night) is not acceptable.
To my comment on the topic at check-out I was answered that a city center is by definition noisy; I slept in quiet rooms in the city centers of Paris, Tokyo, Bangkok, KL, Sydney and New York, and I can not expect less from a 5-star hotel in the center of Barcelona.",3,2015,03,16
23,Fantastic!,"My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon last week and this hotel is fantastic! The staff was excellent and the food was amazing. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. The views from the rooftop pool were tremendous and it was centrally located and close to all the sights you want to see. I would recommend this hotel to anybody going to barcelona, and plan to stay here again if we travel there again.",5,2015,03,15
23,Great location but VERY NOISY room,"Location close to Plaza Catalunya is very central and perfect for visits. Hotel is very recent hence modern and clean. Service is good and friendly. Room design is original, with shower in the middle of the bedroom in superior room.
Matrass is firm and of good standard.
Breakfast is served until 11am and is comprehensive and of good quality.

Big downsize is a very poor insulation, inacceptable for a hotel of this standard located along a busy and noisy street. We were given a room on the 1st floor on the side of the street, despite our room being qualified as superior room, and we could hear cars like they were in the room. Traffic is heavy all night hence very bad sleeping during our 2 nights spent in the hotel, despite demand for a room change just after our arrival, not followed by any action.",4,2015,03,15
23,Awesome Hotel,"Great Customer Service, The Staff really pays attention to comfort. 
Perfect rooms, I took the junior suite which is quite big with a fantastic bathroom. I recommend if you go as a couple the  in-love package.
 They let us check in early as there was room availability. 
The the room service was also great, food was fresh, good and on time. I dont think the food was expensive for the type of hotel.
The Hotel is well centered , you have the subway 50 meters away.

I would definitely go again!",5,2015,03,15
23,Just near away the noise of Ramblas,Just few blocks away the noisy Ramblas. Very hospital accommodation - you get champagne class in reception - style - newstyle rooms - quiet - just a place to relax and if you want action it´s just 2 blocks behind. Little pool in the roof - in the summer great place to relax even you don´t have time to go to beach.,4,2015,03,14
23,Amazing suprise!,"Clean, centrally located, comfortable brand new rooms. A hidden gem in the heart of Barcelona.
Great tapas bar and restaurant on the lower level - and Michelin star restaurant on the upper level. Fantastic bar with amazing cocktails. Actually cheaper than the W hotel - but a lot better value for your money. I highly recommend this place and will certainly be back!!!",5,2015,03,12
23,Superb,"This is just the way top class hotels should be. From Cava on check in, great room, fantastic bar , excellent breakfast.
Location good, near metro, on a busy road , but rooms still quiet. 
Fantastic restaurant as well
Roof top pool with views, but a it chilly in February.
Faultless",5,2015,03,10
23,"Fantastic hotel, great location, lovely staff","I stayed here on a mini break to Barcelona with a friend. The hotel was beautiful and pristine and in an ideal location for exploring Barcelona. 5 minute walk from the ramblas and nearby to all other desirable places. It also really lived up to its 5 stars. For example we were offered complementry champagne whilst checking in and other small details such as an information package on the bed each night with the turn down service, informing us of what's going on in the city (events etc) and the wearer forecast for the following day. The staff were fantastic. We used the conceiarge desk each day for restaurant recommendations, directions, event bookings etc and they couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. We needed an ironing board one day and an extra hairdryer the next and both days they were up with them within minutes of our requests.The room rate was maybe a little pricey, but well worth it and I will definitely be staying there again. The only little thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that the roof terrace/bar and pool were closed (due to time of year) but I thought this would be open, or at least the bar. Would love to come back in the summer when these facilities would be available.",5,2015,03,10
23,Great Hotel in central Barcelona,"We just spent 2 nights at ohla. The location is excellent with all the city centre attractions within 15-20 mins walk. We had a junior suite on the 1st floor. The room was large and comfortable - it can get noisy at night but then this place is in the city centre! The roof terrace was spectacular and coming from cold, wet London it was a reAl bonus to be able to spend 3 hours up there in the sun. We also had the tasting menu at sauc, which was fantastic - especially the service. Thankyou ohla.",5,2015,02,28
23,Excellent five star hotel,"What you would expect from a five star hotel they delliver! Friendly and helpful staff. The suite rooms are more than fine. Quit rooms, breakfast is stunning, everything frech and a lot of variety. Location is also perfect. Nothing bad to say, it is also resonally priced. ",5,2015,02,27
23,"Friendly, contemporary hotel in central city location","The hotel is in an excellent position, seconds from the Urquinaona underground station and a minute from the main shopping street, Passeig de Gracia. All the staff were friendly and helpful from the minute we arrived right until we checked out. We had 2 double rooms, facing the inner courtyard. Both were spacious and well equipped. The bathrooms are a good size too, with a separate door to the toilet. One thing that might bother some people is that there is no door to the bathroom, it's just an open space, fine if you are with a partner, but not so fine if you are with a colleague! Lovely toiletries in the bathroom and thick robes. There's a small kettle too with coffees and teas supplied. The room was rather dark though and we found out that the rooms that face the front of the hotel, room 203 which was next to ours, are brighter.
Also, we were on the second floor and you can feel, however gently, the underground when you're in bed, so ask to be on a higher floor.
There is a beautiful roof terrace and a long, narrow pool with a glass side on the top floor. Lots of lovely sun beds and a bar, which would be wonderful in the summer months. The views from up here are amazing.
Breakfast was included and very good. You help yourself to the usual fare of cold meats, cheeses, cereals etc and they make you pancakes, omelettes etc. 
Lovely bar as well, great for a drink before dinner.
We spoke to the concierge before we arrived and he suggested restaurants for us which he then booked.
One tip, take a taxi from the airport, it cost us with tip about 45 euros, the hotel quoted 89 euros.
This is a contemporary, modern hotel, but don't be put off if you prefer something classic, because it's so comfortable, everything is of a very high quality and the staff are lovely. We will definitely return.",5,2015,02,26
23,Expect more for 5 star,"We arrived around midnight at the hotel and I was initially very impressed. Excellent location, beautiful hotel and lovely room. However, attention to detail let it down for its 5 star status. 

While the shower and steps were very stylish, they proved very impractical. Going to the toilet in the middle of the night was tricky without turning a light on. May have been ok if the floor wasn't soaking wet after our showers. 

The gym looked ok but it's not very good for people who actually want a decent workout. The heaviest weight is 10kg dumbbells which limited our workouts. Might not have minded if we could have swam too but the pool was closed off. Again for a 5 star hotel I would expect it to be heated so it could be used all year round. The sauna was lovely though and we had it to ourselves both days. Very clean and lots of cold water. 

We had problems with the maid taking our own personal coffee cups. They were branded, thermal cups so no mistaking them rubbish or not realising they were ours. After ringing reception we heard the maid rummaging through the rubbish bag and then knocked on our door to give them back. Very strange and no explanation why. Glad we had our valuables in the safe!

My final grumble is about the breakfast. On the surface looked very nice but we were looking forward to a hearty breakfast only to find it was too posh. We wished we had gone out to eat at other local places as they looked like they would actually fill us up properly.  My tea tasted pepper for some strange reason.  

I love Barcelona but I would be very reluctant to stay here again. ",2,2015,02,23
23,Perfect!!!,"We stayed here in the summer for our Mini-Moon and this hotel made the whole trip. From the minute you arrive the staff make you feel so welcome, giving you a glass of bubbly whilst you check in. The rooms are very modern and stylish (the shower is in the middle and the toilet is hidden behind a secret draw). They also had a bottle of bubbly waiting on ice for us in the room. 
The restaurant Sauc is so good we went back twice! The staff were amazing and the food was to die for. I also strongly recommend going to visit the cocktail bar both before (roof top watching the sun go down) and after (funky, cosy bar downstairs) - the choice of cocktails is mindblowing. 
Breakfast in the morning is vast and no request is too much trouble. The pool on the roof top is a great way to doze away the afternoon with sun all day with poolside service and relaxing music playing in the background. The location is also great - very close to The Cathedral, 20 minute walk to the beach and 2 minutes from the bus tour starting location (which we strongly recommend). Will come back to Barcelona just to stay here again.",5,2015,02,23
23,Fantastic location and service ,"We really loved this hotel and felt very looked after from the minute we arrived. The concierge in particular were so helpful. Lots of little touches too. 

The location is perfect especially if you enjoy walking to really get to know a city.

Breakfast was spot on and had a lovely cocktail in the bar.

Only thing I missed was a bath in the room but the shower was excellent.

Thank you xxx",5,2015,02,23
23,Delightful Stay - Excellent Hotel,"Stayed a couple of nights for a last minute short break booked via BA with good flight / hotel deal.

Really liked hotel. It's a boutique style and not too big, being very well located in centre of city including being just 5 minutes from Placa Catalunya Aerobus stop - that is a very efficient & cost effective service to/from airport.

We had deluxe room on 4th Floor which was very pleasant. As mentioned by other reviewers, the shower arrangement in the centre of room is unusual but fine & of very good quality. There was a little bit of road noise, but nothing too obtrusive and certainly did not affect two very good night's sleep in large comfortable bed.

Service is 1st class; efficient & friendly & with several nice little extra ""touches"" that enhanced the experience.

Breakfast is mainly continental buffet which was fine - pleasant relaxed environment.

I have no hesitation recommending & would certainly stay again when next in the city.",5,2015,02,20
23,"Beautiful hotel, great bar and restaurant",Loved this place. Beautiful hotel with a very cute boutique bar with excellent drinks. We were here during christmas time so it was decorated beautifully for the holidays. We also dined at the restaurant upstairs called sauc which was spectacular! ,5,2015,02,10
23,A truly memorable stay with a 5 star service,"We chose to stay here for 2 nights for my daughters 21st birthday and it didn't disapoint.
From the minute we arrived we were greeted with a glass of cava whilst we checked in at reception, we were then shown to our rooms which were upgraded for us compliments of the hotel and they were stunning. Breakfast was excellent with a superb buffet and a choice of a hot course.
The concierge was excellent and found us local restaurants, taxis etc.
We would certainly reccomend this stylish and centrally located hotel to anyone and will definitely return at our next visit to Barcelona.
 ",5,2015,02,09
23,Great Location,"We picked this hotel for its location and were very pleased as to how easy it was to walk to the old city area and port.  The room was very comfortable and we were upgraded to a designer room.  The bed linen very good quality and it had everything we needed as we would expect with a 5 star hotel.  We loved the cocktail bar and the staff were extremely helpful.  We ate at the restaurant and had a very good meal although we were surprised to be the only people there when we arrived at 8.30pm, but we heard that the Spanish eat very late.  The only complaint I have is that there was not a lounge area to sit and relax in after a long day sightseeing and after we had checked out of our room at the end of the stay.  The terrace swimming pool and bar has a great view of the city which we were not able to use during January when it was a bit cold, but must be great during the summer.",5,2015,02,08
23,Fantastic Location - Great Hotel,"A really lovely hotel, in a fantastic location. If you stay in Barcelona then this is a highly recommended place to stay.

Ohla is right at the heart of where you'll want to be to see the best of Barcelona - service is very good and the rooms are great. Although it was too cold to swim when we were there, the rooftop pool looked amazing - and in the sun the terrace was a great place to hang out.  Also, really great cocktails in the bar!

My only issue was that on one of the days we stayed, the breakfast service was just chaotic - no one seemed in charge and people were not getting tables or food.  On the whole, the breakfast was probably the only thing about the place that could have been improved (service and product).",5,2015,02,08
23,This place is so good. ,"This is my 2nd visit to Barcelona in past 6 months, and my first stay in OHLA. It's fair to say I'll come back here for my subsequent visits. The room is spacious, modern, clean and feel fantastic. The service is discreet and unobtrusive. The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city. Highly recommended. ",4,2015,02,07
23,"Modern hotel, excellent service, convenient location","Ohla was a lovely place to stay during our trip to Barcelona and gave us a unique and enjoyable experience. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and clean. The concierge was very helpful. The hotel is very close to the best neighborhoods in Barcelona, making it a convenient central location for our trip.",5,2015,02,04
23,Engagement Weekend - Superb Hotel,"I booked this hotel as part of a package through BA.  I choose this hotel as a special venue to propose to my girlfriend and was extremely happy with my choice.  A few weeks before my stay, I contacted Jorge Biedma within the hotel Experience Team and Jorge's help and service was exceptional.  Jorge reserved me a roof-top chill-out area for the evening and made special arrangements to organise rose petals, music and a special bottle of Champagne (Specially ordered in - not on the menu) along with going the extra mile to ensure a gas heater was in place to keep us warm for our time there.  The night was amazing and everything went as planned.  Jorge also booked us a very private table in Sauc Restuarant for after the proposal and the meal was fantastic! We choose the larger taster menu and every course was explained in detail and presented magnificiently.  Faultless!

Our room was great, they are designed for couples and the shower feature adds to the room's character.  Ignore all the comments about being too small, if you're from the UK, it's the stardard size.  The location of the hotel was great too.

All in all 10 out of 10.  Thanks Jorge and the Ohla team! Great service!",5,2015,01,28
23,Awesome.,"Everything was top notch- concierge service, room cleaning, ambiance and Sauc and the cocktail bar were awesome. Truly excellent food and drinks. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was making a trip to Barcelona. When we come back we will stay there again.",5,2015,01,24
23,An okay 4 star hotel service,"The hotel itself is in an amazing location! It is just in the middle of everything! Beach is so close, you can take a walk, and at the same time most of architectural sight seeings is close by as well.
Appearance of the hotel from the outside is so modern and old style at the same time (its an old building with a very modern twist, especially those eye balls on the building). Staff is okay, not 5 star treatment for sure, maybe more like 4 star hotel staff.
Reception was fine, and the guy was friendly and professional, but next day we tried ordering water, so we had to wait for 6 hours to be delivered into our room.
We had booked a junior suite, which in any other hotel would be just a deluxe room. It was more like a corner room, so we did not have any nice view, and you need to keep it in mind, that junior suite is located on the second floor (never a good sign) :)
Breakfast was included in the room package, but unfortunately this was the most disappointing experience while staying here. Not a big selection of breakfast choices, you can order a pancake or an egg, but two mornings in the row I got them served cold and tasteless. 
Hotel has a bar, which is surprisingly good! Cocktails served there were so creative and tasty!
So all in total, hotel is okay, but in my opinion, more like a four star service, rather than five.",3,2015,01,21
23,Great Hotel!,"We loved this hotel from the moment we arrived. I loved the glass of bubbles on arrival which got our trip off to a nice start.

The bedrooms with the shower in the middle of the room are a great concept, make sure you're in a room with someone you want to see you naked though as they'll definitely get a peek with the design of it.

The products supplied in the bathroom of a nice standard and smelt lovely.

Breakfast was not too bad with a variety of options of eggs and pancakes.

We had the tapas option for our first night as well and it really was a really nice choice of dishes they bring out for you to try. The cocktails were nice and strong too.

All in all we had a very pleasant stay and would recommend for anyone looking for a stylish place t stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,01,19
23,High quality hotel in a convinient location,"The location of the hotel is really convenient for both a business trip and visiting Barcelona. Close to shopping, attractions, metro, even the bus from the airport. On a busy street, but quiet at night (at a a higher floor).

Room design is somewhat minimalistic, and some might be puzzled by an all-glass shower. No worries, the steam from a shower fogs the glass, so you are not self-conscious (if sharing the room with somebody, a significant other I presume). Very clean, comfortable, with all the amenities. Really worth getting a more expensive (deluxe?) room, as it is just an OK size; can only imagine basic rooms would be really small, at least for a business traveler. 

Service is professional and friendly, though I may suggest some improvements in terms of making sure the rooms are stocked properly for the number of people there (ie extra towels had to be requested, and some shower items not replaced one day).

Gastrobar downstairs is really good, but pricey for dinner. Worth trying at least once, though there a lot of better value-for-money options in Barcelona. Cocktails are phenomenal, though not cheap either.",5,2015,01,19
23,Fantastic!!!,"Can not recommend enough. Stayed for my partners 21st - had a wonderful experience trying all the appetizers in the restaurant even though some were not to our taste. Great service too. Our room was great with everything we asked for! We had a junior suite - definitely recommend that. Had our friends surprise my partner and we reserved a section of the bar. All the drinks, cake, balloons were all organised perfectly and we had a lovely German waitress serve us all night who was great. We also had some cocktails at the bar which were so much fun to watch being made. My friend had one come in a treasure box in a shell, and I had an Irish Mermaid which involved lots of cocktail throwing and fancy moves from the barman which gave us such a show! We were a bit late for breakfast the next day but they even managed to serve us!! Special thanks to Mr Biedma who really made everything run so smoothly. Definitely would want to come back!!!",5,2015,01,19
23,"Great NYE , perfect location","Modern, clean , great location, amazing staff and hands down the best bar in world!! Many thanks to the great service and killer cocktails !! We will be back !! Great spot for New Years eve , walking distance to some of the coolest places in the city . ",5,2015,01,13
23,"Nice hotel, but REALLY firm beds...","OK location, OK breakfast, OK Fitness room. 
A minus for the incredibly firm bed. Had to lay on several layers of duvet, blankets and cushions, but still too firm for my back. Was like lying on a concrete floor :(
And a minus for no heated rooftop pool. I think it should be manageable to heat such a small pool. 11 degrees is not my comfort bathing temperature....",4,2015,01,12
23,Nice but not a true 5 star,"I'm 40 yrs old and an experienced traveler having staying in many five star hotels before.  I'm American living full time in Germany where hotels cannot define their own star rating but must be awarded by a national classification system.  I deem this information important in validating my review.

The Ohla hotel is very nice.  It is ideally located in Barcelona and will afford visitors with access to all the must see attractions.  The staff is friendly, helpful and ever eager to please.  My girlfriend and I stayed in the Ohla Junior suite for four nights.  We paid an avg of 400 EUR per night, breakfast included.

We enjoyed our time but I do not classify Ohla as a five star hotel.  Why?

The hotel staff does not speak a competent/professional level of English.  While the hotel resides in a country which speaks Spanish and in principal Spanish should be the main language spoken, the reality is that it's visitors do not speak Spanish.  Therefore, in my opinion the hotel staff should be professionally competent in speaking English and/or French as the most widely spoken international languages.  Other five star hotels I have visited have staff whom fluently speak English, French, German, Spanish and various Asian dialects. 

For a hotel which is relatively new it has several degrading structural features which gives the guest a feeling of a hotel under repair rather than a five star hotel.  The junior suite we stayed in was on the second floor.  After ordering the junior suite online I expected that we would be on a higher floor with a better view of the city.  Again we were on a lower floor which rumbled with the sound the underground.  (Thankfully this did not continue past midnight during the week, 2am Friday).

Our suite had a poorly repaired hole behind the TV.  The lighting fixtures were uncontrollable due to faulty switches. 

(Not something I have subtracted points for but rather want to point out as a design flaw is the separate room with toilet.  The door does not have a handle, the door swings inward rather than outward and the staff placed special emphasis on pointing out where the toilet is as if the location had confused a lot of their previous guests)

On the website I had the impression that the french doors in the suite would open out onto a balcony.  The doors did not open.  In fact the doors/windows do not open at all to even let in a modest amount of fresh air.  

While not the fault of the hotel, it was clear that the suites previous guests had smoked in the room.  The cleaning staff used a horrible fragrance to mask or help with the smoke smell.

On the website I also had the impression that the pool with be useable.  We were told upon arrival that the pool was closed for the winter.  When we went up to the rood to see the truly stunning/picturesque view the pool was open, towels were available.  However the pool was not heated.  Despite it being January and temperature in the range of 7-12 degrees C it would have been a truly exceptional experience to swim in such a pool.  Again with a five star you would expect for it to be open and heated.

Internet is inclusive with the price of the hotel.  That said the internet was non functional when we were in the room.  Internet access was secure with a username/password required but access was not possible from the room.

The breakfast was nice but again with a five star you expect something special.  There was the usual assortment of juices, breads, cheeses and fruits.  A special coffee (latte, cappuccino, etc) was charged separately as was ordering of eggs.

At the end of the day the Ohla is a nice, modern hotel which no doubt most will feel well staying in.  However for the discerning tastes of those who expect a certain standard of quality associated with a five star experience, Ohla falls short.",3,2015,01,12
23,We absolutely LOVED this hotel..,"Everything was great.. the Junior Suite, the views from this room and the roof terrace, the staff unfailingly excellent, the location in this wonderful, vibrant city.  We will certainly return and would not think to go to any other hotel.",5,2015,01,10
23,Beautiful Hotel in the Center of Barcelona,"To make a long story short...great and very experienced, friendly staff. Beautiful hotel with an amazing rooftop and pool. Nice and clean room. 
Wasn't so happy with the room service food but the breakfast was very delicious with plenty of options. 
The location is great and to remind you...the view from the rooftop is top notch. So there is no reason why not to stay at Ohla Hotel :-) Enjoy!",5,2015,01,07
23,Wonderfull Hotel,"This is a real 5 star hotel. Situated in the heart of Barcelona, walking distance to several touristic points as Palau de La Musica Catalana, Ramblas, Barrio Gotico, Passeig de Gracia, La Pedrera , Casa Batló, etc.
They have a one star Michelin restaurant. An excellent bar at the lobby. And all the hotel is perfectly decorated.
The room is amazing. I had a room with a view of the Barrio Gotico.
Breakfast is perfect; the staff is very helpful and nice. The swimming poll on the roof top is the most impressive place of the Hotel. Unvelievable place!
I highly recommend staying at this Hotel in Barcelona. Unforgettable experience.",5,2015,01,06
23,Great stay in the middle of Barcelona,"The Ohla was a fantastic hotel. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with a glass of Cava and we just felt relaxed. The service and the hotel staff are fantastic. This was literally the best hotel check in I've ever had. The rooms while a little small were very nicely appointed. This could have been an average size room for Barcelona/Europe so I'm used to slightly bigger rooms. 

One thing to note the glass shower is in the middle of the room. While this is ok for couples, everybody else should be aware. It could be a little awkward. Also the bathroom has a hidden door and can be a little awkward to get into. Otherwise everything else was fantastic. The room was very modern and spotless. The rooftop pool and lounge is out of this world. It's in a great spot and everything is close by. The hotel was one of the highlights of our European tour.",5,2015,01,05
23,"Great location, very good service","We were happy with our recent five-night stay.  We were able to walk to most places, and the hotel is no more than about a ten-minute walk from several Metro stations.  The breakfast offerings were plentiful; the concierge was very helpful; and all of the staff were very friendly.  We also had a very nice dinner in the main restaurant one night.",4,2015,01,05
23,Great location,"I stayed at the hotel from the 30th of December to the 3rd of January. The staff was very lovely and accommodating to our needs. We could literally walk to most places that we wanted to go like La Rambla and the Picasso museum. The concierge was very knowledgeable about what to do whilst in Barcelona during that time of the year as it was my first time being there in the winter. Lovely atmosphere. The breakfast was included in our booking and it was lovely although there was not much of a spread with comparison to other hotels. Nevertheless, everything tasted great. The bar was fantastic!! All in all, i had a fantastic time!",4,2015,01,04
23,Good quality but needs some small improvements,"I lived in Barcelona for a year back in 2004 so know the town well and the various dining and hotel establishments.  Ohla is well placed directly opposite the magnificent Palau de la musica catalana and has a striking exterior consistent with its surroundings.  

As frequent users of Mr and Mrs Smith we received an upgrade upon arrival and were happy with the prompt and efficient check in.  The bedroom was clean and comfortable without being exceptional, but well equipped for the price paid.  The first wrinkle was the difficulty in ordering some tapas/nibbles in the restaurant downstairs at around 4pm; we were told that the kitchen was closed and that we would have to eat outside.  In a 5 star hotel there should ALWAYS be eating options or there is a problem to be honest.  The other odd aspect was that we could have ordered room service from our bedroom, but could not order from downstairs in the restaurant/bar??

The unfortunate corollary was that we attempted to sate our hunger in a dreadful bar down the road which i should have realised was not up to the standards we required and of course Barcelona is full of wonderful places open all day and night.  The next suggestion was superb - Llamber is a new restaurant in the Borne area and is an excellent example of the recent wave of quasi fine dining at the right price with a fantastic selection of wines by both the bottle and glass.

We had a peak at the rooftop pool and bar which seemed fun but it was clearly not the right season to enjoy the facilities (november).  In sum i would consider this hotel a good attempt but just falling down on a couple of small points - for the real boutique luxury of course there is nothing better than the Hotel Neri (but this is a more expensive option).",4,2015,01,03
23,Great hotel for a reasonable price,"We love the Ohla, the style, ambiance, location and especially the food...terrific dishes and drinks. Be sure to have a gin & tonic at the Boutique Bar. 

Service is excellent and the staff were very helpful and friendly. I can highly recommend the receptionist, Josè Oroña. ",4,2015,01,02
23,Modern Hotel in the Old Quarter,"The location could not be bettered for exploring the whole of central Barcelona.  Right by the old quarter but a very up-to-date building with interesting modern architecture, including eyes on stalks on the outside walls!  Inside spaces are pleasant and workable.  Top class restaurant in the form of Sauc, but the gastrobar is somewhat underwhelming.  Good range of fresh ingredients for continental breakfast, although cooked options less inspired.  Our room (Junior Suite) was very spacious with modern equipment, very comfortable and clean.  A few more extras would not come amiss - eg better coffee in the room, free supply of bottled water - but you do get chocolates when they come in to turn down the bed.  Staff outstanding - very friendly and helpful.  Management seems to work well and it was easy, for instance, to arrange cars to and from the airport.",4,2015,01,02
23,Well...,"Me and my wife came here on our hunnymoon.and it IS a very nice hotel with a beautiful roof terrace and super cool swimming pool!
But some things were strange,there were two elevators and you had to change halfway up if you wanted to go all the way up to the roof!
The breakfast was also strange with a coffe machine that only 50% or so of the guests understood how to operate it seemed...I would expect more than a selfservice coffemachine from a 5star hotel!
The actual breakfast staff also seemed distracted in a way and not very attentive or eager to help.... Beautiful hotel with many friendly people working there but it could have been much better.",3,2014,12,27
23,Great Location!,"We enjoyed our stay here, so close to the Rambla and Plaza Catalunya, plus the whole Barri Gotic.  I loved the ""eyeballs"" sprouting from the outside walls and the glass of cava while checking in, sitting down.  The room was a little noisy, being on the first floor, but not too bad.The staff was great, and they noticed it was my birthday and sent a bottle of cava up to our room.  They should replace the hall rug - a little shabby-looking.  The pool on the terrace was striking - a raised glass enclosure.  The view was worth a trip, and one can order food to be sent up there.  The room was comfortable and clean, which is sooooo important.  there's a great breakfast buffet at the Gastrobar, downstairs. I would give the Ohla a 4 1/2, but I can't figure out how to do it!",4,2014,12,23
23,Great Stay,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the stay.  The room was nice size, quite and very clean and nice linens. The concierges made legit suggestions and also securing great last min reservations.  Every night we started in the bar and to a very friendly and professional staff that made exquisite cocktails, served in the perfect vessel to complete the experience, kudos to Giuseppe.
Overall top class hotel in a great location, when we go back to this great city we will stay here again.",5,2014,12,14
23,Wonderful hotel!,Everything was just great! We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely come back! The Room at the 6th floor was very quiet and the breakfast was very good! Especially the location is a reason for booking this hotel! The staff was extremly helpful and friendly!,4,2014,12,14
23,"Perfect location, artsy hotel, beautiful rooftop view!","We ended our honeymoon by staying at the Ohla hotel for 2 nights. I would choose this hotel again, simply on its perfect location in the Gothic quarter. We walked everywhere! The restaurant in the hotel is a bit pricey, but we enjoyed exploring other nearby tapas restaurants! The staff was very helpful and accommodating. Be aware that there is a shower pretty much in the middle of the room that is fully exposed, all glass. So if you are planning a trip with your family, you might want to keep this in mind. Things to do: check out the El Born area (specifically Golfo de Bizkaia, and Numero Nueve). There are a few neat tapas bars right by the Cathedral we enjoyed too. A must do is go to the La Boqueria and eat at Bar Clemen's!! Also highly recommend going to Sagrada Familia, it truly is unbelievable! And all the shopping, oh my!! (A little further away -short cab ride- is a place called ""el bosc de les fades"" pretty cool place if you have time!)",5,2014,12,14
23,Glamerous inside and out,"I have to admit I chose this hotel purely because of the curious decor on the outside (the building is covered in eyeballs.) It was a treat for my last night in BCN with a friend. On check in we were offered cava while they sorted out the papers, and shown to our room with a great view on the 6th floor (only slightly extra charge for the view, and well worth it to wake up looking out at iconic Barcelona!) Make sure to allow time to hang out on the rooftop terrace (the pool isn't heated, so a bit nippy in winter, but it's still lovely)",5,2014,12,08
23,Great location and helpful staff.,"First time to BCN and was really pleased with location as it is central to everything. Staff were very helpful and genuine. The main restaurant was okay, but I found the morning crew a bit cold in their demeanor. The gym is small and lacks variety of equipment options. I would recommend the Ohla as a great option and would go back. ",4,2014,12,06
23,Very nice hotel in a great location,"For us first-timers to Barcelona, Hotel Ohla is perfect for the first portion of our visit:  Within walking distance (2-3 blocks) from the Aerobus stop on Placa de Catalunya; literally across the street from Palau de la Musica Catalana; easy and picturesque strolls to most of the major touristic sites in La Ribera and the Barri/Gothic section.  Other pluses:  Pleasant, polite, and helpful staff (we arrived early from our transatlantic flight and were offered not only  a room right away but were also upgraded to a Design room on the 6th floor:  Thank you!); the hotel feels small and intimate;  our room was quiet; breakfast (included in our rate) was plentiful and nicely presented, with eggs cooked to order.  We had an afternoon light meal in their Gastro Bar and were very pleased with the quality of the food and the friendly service.

A few minor points:  For a five-star hotel, our room did not feel that luxurious (no turn-down service; bath linens for exactly 2 persons only without any face towels and without an extra set); the black and white color schema seems a bit austere and can benefit from a few more flourishes particularly for longer stays, and some of the furnishings are already showing signs of wear-and-tear.

In all though, a great choice in this section of town.",4,2014,12,05
23,"""FRIENDLY HOTEL IN THE CITY CENTER""","We have booked this hotel because of central location and of course we liked design on pics.
When we arrived we found out WE DID GOOD !!! Historical from outside and very nicely designed inside. Some people have complained about hotel being too dark but I liked it :)
Front desk staff were really helpful and showed us our room. We booked deluxe designer room, which has a full glass shower in the room ,which could be a problem for some people......but not for us. We are kind of picky people ......so the next day we moved to suite. It was more like it for us as we have a one year old baby and there was a bathtub plus shower and plenty of space to run around. So if you prefer bathtub go for suite.The room was beautiful with the view of Via Laietana an two big windows, which are exactly what I need...........when falling asleep I can look out and watch what is going on outside.
Bed is very comfortable. Coffee and tea facilities are in the room and complimentary water is arranged. 
Breakfast - we would like to thank to ""dark blond"" gentleman, who took care of us every morning at 7am :) ..........if you are looking for big selection, you are in a wrong place. This hotel prefer quality over quantity, which we appreciated........we got all we wished for............including sparkling wine. Breakfast restaurant is awesome with huge 4m high windows and view of small square.......very romantic in the early morning light :) 
As I said hotel is in the Gothic quarter and walking distance from the most interesting places. Just a few steps from Barcelona cathedral.............
The gentlemen in reception welcome us every morning with big smile and were helping us with directions and restaurant findings............
We will be back :)
PS : for light sleepers.....you can actually hear metro",5,2014,12,04
23,"Fine hotel, hotel bar a bit strange..","The hotel is fine, friendly staff and nice rooms. The bar area is a bit strange in opening hours and the service seems a bit slow i.e. there is not always somebody there to help you.
Concierge is very friendly, the reception is somewhat difficult to find...
All taken together it is a fine place to stay for a long weekend.",4,2014,11,30
23,great hotel,Like it very much. the shower lay out is a litle too intimate for our taste but we had a great time with my wife. I would stay agian the breakfast is great. Whar else can i erite about it i dont know i eish it was not 200 characters.,4,2014,11,29
23,Ohla - Surreal but fun experience,"It was my first trip to Barcelona with my wife and I was quite looking forward to the trip. We were there for 3 nights (an extended weekend) and we chose to stay at a hotel near the La Ramblas so that we were in walking distance to  most of the interesting places we wanted to visit. Ohla fit the bill for us. Ohla is located in the Gothic district and is smack bang in the middle of La Rambla and Passieg de Gracia. The moment you step out to see the hotel - you kinda get the gist of what it's about. The exterior of the hotel is covered with hundreds of 'eyeballs'. While these are curiosity in themselves, I found it a bit disconcerting that they had essentially defaced a gorgeous building to add these 'eyeballs'. Personally I would have loved the building as it originally was.  The exterior is old and reminds me several Victorian buildings in Liverpool. But I can also see why they are there - they represent the quirkiness which this hotel attempts to embody. The moment you step in you are greeted by the concierge and on to the left is the gastropubesque restaurant while around the corner from the concierge desk is a beautiful (and quirky) bar. The main hotel reception is located on (bear with me here) floor 0.5 - no that's not a typo - it quite literally says 0.5 inside the lift. The folks at the reception were efficient and friendly. Check in took less than 5 minutes as we had pre-booked. Our porter led us to our room. The lifts and the doors work with contactless cards and they worked as expected. The room - was well surprising. Again the room attempts to be unique and quirky. The centre of the room has an all glass shower and  to the right side is a generous and comfy bed while the left has the wash basin and towel. It's a bit of a bizarre design. And the toilet - well the toilet is completely hidden - it was inside a smaller room hidden on the far side wall. If someone didn't point it out initially ( in our case it was the friendly porter) it would take a while for one to figure it out. As a couple - this bizarre design worked for us but if you were on business and sharing a room with a colleague things would get mighty awkward in the morning! That said I am assuming that there are rooms which are more conventional and aimed at business travelers ( I don't know - I didn't ask). The air conditioning system is great within the room and cools or heats up the room pretty quickly. The lighting controls were a bit strange but we got used to it in the end. We had breakfast at the gastro bar in the morning and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. We also spent one quiet evening in the boutique bar and the drinks were great and it had a great ambience. We couldn't check out the roof top bar and we didn't dine at the Sauc restaurant. Room service was good - though we once got woken up in the evening by the turndown service (we were already asleep - exhausted after a day of sight seeing) 

The hotel is in a very convenient location. We managed to walk to most of the attractions (you are minutes away from the cathedral) . We did catch a taxi every now and then but being on the main road you wouldn't really have a problem catching a taxi. The concierge was very helpful in directing us around the city and the made a few recommendations in terms of great restaurants around the city. Overall I would say we have had a very pleasant stay and I would recommend it to others with a few caveat - it's not a regular 5 star hotel - it's a boutique hotel and it intends to stand out. If you are like my wife - who prefers the regular star hotels - you might find the hotel not to your taste. I quite liked the quirky ambiance of the place myself. The second - the price - it's a 5 star place but its one of the most expensive at the time. There are others like the Meridien which is on the La Rambla which might offer better value for money, but hotel prices change all the time anyway. Value for money means different things to different people. So go through sites like Trivago etc and compare them. It also largely depends on what you intend to do in Barcelona - we were here for a couples break with the intention to do some sight seeing, eat and shop. And Ohla worked for us

Oh - not that I need to mention it - but the WiFi is free and it actually works!",5,2014,11,28
23,Excellent location but still quite nights,"Great hotel in the Gothic part of the town, on main street,  close to good shops, bars, Barcelona Cathedral but still very quite.  Even on the 3rd floor I had no noise pollution at all.  Lovely staff, crisp clean sheets, kettle in the room which is not common for European hotels.",4,2014,11,27
23,Great Place to Stay,"We spent 3 nights at the Ohla and loved it. It's in a perfect location for enjoying the Gothic Quarter, the Ramblas, and the high end shopping district. Service was exceptional from the concierge (Albert - 30+ years experience) bellmen, reception staff, restaurant staff, and housekeeping. Albert provided great recommendations on touring, restaurants, shopping, and transportation. He is worth his weight in gold. Our room was spotless and very comfortable. The rooftop pool, bar, and patio were cool. The lobby bar had award winning bartenders and drink production was fun to watch. Barcelona is a great city and if we are able to return, we will stay at the Ohla. ",5,2014,11,26
23,new boutique hotel,"good location for tourists and chic interior design.
would recommend upgrading to design deluxe as we stayed in 'design superior' but the room was still too 'cosy'. The unconcealed shower is interesting but I certainly would not recommend it if your self conscious or staying with a friend!!

was initially in room opposite gym 1 above reception but could hear trains passing at night with alarming frequency. I'm not a light sleeper so it was ok but felt moving would be best if possible- staff were very happy to accommodat this so moved 2 floors higher but to my surprise the noise was still the same. Also the pool is unfortunately way too freezing to consider a dip during November!

              ",4,2014,11,25
23,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"Ohla is, as advertised, a first class hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  The Concierge was excellent and all staff were professional.  Breakfast was excellent and the bartenders are true mixologists.

Unfortunately the weather was a bit cool so we could not enjoy the rooftop pool and lounge as we would have liked since the pool is not heated. 

We stayed in a suite and it was spacious and comfortable.

I'd stay there again on a return visit without a doubt.",5,2014,11,24
23,Amazing location,"My husband and I stayed at Ohla Hotel for 4 nights in November 2014. It was our first city break together since we were kids with our own families, we loved how central it was restaurants and shop :). I have never walked so far in my life.
The hotel was beautiful better then we could have thought and were upgraded to the Junior suite on arrival which was nice. 
The dinner menu in the hotel was amazing we ate at both restaurants and could not fault the Sauc restaurant. The only thing that I could think could do with improving would be breakfast, it seemed very bland and very much the same everyday and my husband loves his big breakfasts.
Overall we had a great trip and would come back again.",4,2014,11,24
23,Ohla Hotel Barcelona,We visited this hotel in August 2013 and have to sat it was an amazing hotel. We loved the roof top bar and pool with great views. How the other half live!! The rooms were very modern and simple and weirdly they have the glass shower cubicle and bathroom in the middle of the room and to find the toilet we had to press one of the wall panels which then popped open to reveal it!!! That took a while and in that time we thought there was no toilet in the room.,5,2014,11,22
23,Skip this hotel - they are not concerned at all about guest safety,"I stayed here for three nights in November. Overall, the hotel is very minimalist and the rooms are very small. But what I liked least about the hotel was how lax they were with guest security. I always leave theDo Not Disturb sign on my door, and request nobody enter. It was disregarded by their staff, and many of my items were thrown away or taken. 
I also left my key in the room once, and when I asked for a new one, they did not even ask for ID, just my room number. This is a terrible breach of security, as anyone could ask for any room number they want, and rob the guests at will. 
The elevator is key access, but your key will allow entry to any floor you want, not just your floor. This defeats the purpose of a key access elevator. 
Decent location, but their lack of guest security concern would make me stay far away from this hotel in the future. I expect better from a five star hotel, the service and guest concern would hardly rank this as a two star hotel in my book. 
Avoid.",1,2014,11,20
23,Falls short of the promise,Were here in a junior suite for three nights.  Great location in the heart of the city. The concierge was good. The reception area is small and pokey and the staff not very welcoming.  The room was nice but will not suit all as the bathroom area is part of the bedroom so no privacy.  The breakfast service was poor as it did take some time to be seated and then we had to call staff over to order the hot breakfast EVERY MORNING!  One morning we were told there were no poached eggs but all other egg dishes were fine.  Why??  Because they have to be cooked at 62 degrees??? I assume their sous vide machine was not working - but no other explanation was forthcoming.  The dining room is rather severe and masculine and the menu pretty hardcore with sea cucumber - be warned.  Food OK but not worthy of a Michelin star.,3,2014,11,19
23,The bar is a MUST in this great value and location 5-star hotel,"Great boutique hotel in a superb location with very helpful staff. 

Even before considering the hotel it is worth knowing that the Ohla cocktail bar is IMPRESSIVE. The drinks are imaginative and delicious. This bar is worth travelling for.

Arrival was flawless with a glass of cava and a free upgrade to a junior suite. The hotel style is very nice and rooms are well equipped - only, it feels odd to have a conversation bathroom with an open plan design. Roof top terrace is spectacular. 

But all is not well. Breakfast is a massive let down: an uninspired buffet. The limited orders from the breakfast menu are peculiar, such as two poached eggs floating in olive oil with a couple of crunchy potatoes. Feels pretentious in a very flawed way. Also staff are not able to keep up clearing used plates and cutlery, and from 9-10 there is a queue for a table.

23,Great Stay,The location is excellent right in the heart of Barcelona. The rooftop pool with an excellent view of the city alone is worth the stay. The hotel is a renovated old building which is cool and the hola bar has some excellent tapas. Overall great stay and highly recommended.,5,2014,11,15
23,This hotel is perfect in every way.,"This hotel is just perfect! Is is clean, the rooms are spacious and the location is great! In advance, we were a bit worried that such a high class hotel would not be suited for children, but it was! We loved it, and so did our 2-year old:)                      ",5,2014,11,12
23,Fabulous Barcelona,"This hotel is superbly central to all tourist hotspots, many Gaudi buildings in direct vicinity.
Amazing hotel, as on outside is a typical character Spanish building, (except for the silly eyeballs everywhere).  But the inside has been decorated very modern.
We have Junior suite and it is superb, especially as we are here for 7 nights, so has great layout with couch in middle to allow relaxation and room to move, also very light.  BUT make sure you ask for a room on the higher floors, as the jnr suites are on the side where the underground railway runs and our first room on the second floor was very noisy, but they agreed to shift us to 5th floor and although can still faintly hear, does not disturb.
Really lovely breakfast, typical european, meat/cheese eggs done many ways (not too large but the omelette with onions/potatoes is tasty), fruit and superb pastries.  The usual juices etc.
Overall great hotel, in fantastic city both well worth the visit.",5,2014,11,04
23,Where is the service!?,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel.  On arrival, we were impressed with the facade of the building, beautiful old architecture and in a great location.  Very tastefully designed welcome/reception area, a real boutique feel.  The glass of cava offered on arrival is a nice touch.  We arrived around midday and our room wasn't ready so we headed out, being told they would call us when the room was - we never got this call! This lack of service unfortunately continued through the duration of our stay.  First night in the hotel bar, we order 2 drinks, the waiter brought one and we thought he was making the other whist chatting to his mate,15 mins later we realised he was not and had to give him the nod, It's not like it was even busy in there, there were 4 people including us!  The breakfast was a total shambles, buffet breakfast with a menu on your table where you an order one extra dish (mainly eggs), except no one ever comes round the take the orders - no table service whatsoever and we weren't the only ones.  Eventually I had to go and ask the receptionist who took our order!  No tea or coffee served at the table, only from a machine and tables not cleared, not what I call 5 star service!  The rooms albeit comfortable are very disappointing, very bland, an almost office feel with a huge strip light hanging across the room, also showing signs of wear and tear all over, had a slightly shabby feel, definitely not luxurious and most certainly not 5 star.  We did air our views with the receptionist on departure and were assured management would be informed, I hope so because with a bit of room maintenance and some service this could be a good hotel.",3,2014,11,04
23,Hands down best location !!!,"Stayed here for eight nights and every facet of the hotel was wonderful. First, the location is the best in Barcelona for walking and restaurants. Staff was friendly and accommodating all the time. Breakfast was plenty and filling for all tastes. The room was large and well appointed. I loved every moment in Barcelona and enjoyed staying at Ohla hotel.",5,2014,11,03
23,Fantastic Stay,"Friends of ours stayed here in May earlier this year, so it was on there recommendation that we decided to stay at the Ohla Hotel.
Our first impressions were good and it only got better, check in staff were really helpful and the concierge desk team were excellent, they spent along time providing useful information about Barcelona and booking tickets to various sights and the city tour bus.
Our room was on the quieter side of the hotel, it was very comfortable and provided all we could want, the shower takes a little getting used to but is fun and very different to most hotels you stay in.
The pool area on top of the hotel is a lovely place to relax/swim and enjoy the beautiful view over the city.
Hotel Ohla is in a great position and provides easy access to many of the best parts of this wonderful city, 200 meters from the hotel you can catch the city tour bus which provides 3 routes around the city, its great for jumping on and off and enjoy many of the attractions, great value and a bus comes every 10-15 minutes.
We are going back to Barcelona next April and will be heading back to Hotel Ohla.",5,2014,11,03
23,perfect location but just short of a 5 star hotel!,"We were travelling as a couple and stayed in one of the suites on the first floor. we loved the minimalistic decor and open plan bath and shower. The toilet is behind a secret door in the rooms. The lobby is small, but the breakfast offers quality food varying from fried/poached/scrambled/boiled eggs with accompaniments, lots of breads, croissants, fresh fruits, yogurts etc. I wanted a cappuccino and the staff were more than helpful to make one for me as it wasn't available through the coffee machines. the eggs and other hot stuff is made fresh to order and not mass production. The portion isn't big but there is lots to eat otherwise.I can't praise the concierge staff enough, they are extremely courteous and helpful. Booked us tickets to various attractions, helpful with restaurant recommendations, you name it and they will do it for you. There is a small pool on the roof top and a bar with seating area, good place to chill out! Noise is definitely an issue, but then, we were in restaurants in the area and could feel and hear the metro underground so not really sure what the hotel would do to improve this!",4,2014,11,02
23,One of the best boutique hotels in Barcelona,"This 74 room hotel is simply fantastic. We were met with a big smile and a glass of cava when we arrived. The room was very nice and so was the bathroom. On the roof there is a small swimming pool with a great view over the city centre.

The breakfast restaurant was one of the best I have ever visited. You can order whatever you like. My personal favourite breakfast wat scrambled eggs cooked to perfection toppen with som slices of Iberico bacon. 

In Ohla there is a small bar that is run by one top bartenders in the world. He simply males designer coctails for you. I was really impressed by his skills.

I will certainly book a room there next time I travel to Barcelona.",5,2014,10,30
23,Good Location but not a 5 star Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights. I must say this hotel is well located and very central, and it had a lovely roof terrace which was a plus. 
Unfortunately, the room was small, cold and minimalistic and had a strange open plan bathroom arrangemnt and a claustrophobic toilet with a door that couldn't be kept open. The bathroom wasn't separate to the room, which was odd and the sink didn't have a plug so I couldn't keep any water in the wash hand basin. (Made shaving a challenge to say the least).
We were on a bed and breakfast deal, although the breakfast was pretty limited with tiny portions.
Staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and suggested some good restaurants.
Overall I was disappointed with the experience and expected more of a true 5 star hotel. I got the feeling the hotel designer tried to be different at all cost and not overly practical.
If I return to Barcelona, I will try out another hotel.",3,2014,10,30
23,Perfect location but not quite 5 star. ,"The hotel is in a great location for las ramblas and shopping centres and it also an enjoyable walk to many other of the sights around the city. We stayed in an upgraded room which was small but perfectly addressed. The problem with the room is that it was on the first floor and quite noisy from the outside traffic and footfall which is very noticeable at 7 in the morning, in addition although we had a do not disturb sign on the door the cleaning staff decided to ignore this which was not ideal. The roof terrace is a big plus point for the hotel and a great place to relax with lovely views over parts of the city. The pool itself understandably not the biggest but still very nice and warm. The gym is clean and functional with modern equipment and weights with a nice little sauna and relaxing area. The hotel itself is very well presented and the concierge on the front desk are excellent, they will happily book any trips you want to do and provide very good advice with a nice tourist map. Breakfast itself is good but the service was very slow when trying to order hot food. The cocktails are expensive but excellent, it is easy to see that the mixologists really love their job. Overall I didn't feel that this was truly a 5 star hotel but it wasn't far from the mark. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a first time visitor to the city due to its location, roof top terrace and the willing helpfulness of the concierge service. If you like your sleep and find yourself on the first floor just ask for a higher room. By the way it's about 30 euros from the airport to the hotel by taxi and about 40 euros on return. ",4,2014,10,29
23,"Hotel common areas good, room average or below","Stayed here for three nights.  

Checked into an ""essential"" room, on the second floor. First thing that struck me was twin beds as opposed to a double.  Second, absolutely no view at all and almost below street level at back of hotel.  Third the noise of the underground train and the vibration from it as it rattled through the streets below Barcelona.

The room is minimalist in design and to my mind, even when fully lit, looks cold and uninviting. My travel partner had a room on the fourth floor and experienced the same feeling about his room but didn't suffer from the noise of the underground train.

The breakfast buffet is fine but a fairly limited selection and the freshly cooked option is nouvelle cuisine like, bacon and eggs? Try one tiny egg and one rasher of bacon!

There is a decent bar on the ground floor and a lovely roof top terrace.

Staff are courteous and knowledgeable.

However this is not the quality for a five star hotel, they maybe should take a trip to the Ritz Carlton just down the road to see how a nice star hotel operates.",3,2014,10,27
23,Fantastic Hotel - The Best Staff & Service in Barcelona!,"We recently stayed here for our 10th Anniversary and we could not have been more pleased that we had chosen the Ohla hotel.  I travel globally and stay in hotels 100 nights a year, so i'm picky, and this hotel was incredible. The staff was amazing and treated us extremely well, including a nice gift in our room to celebrate our 10th year together.  The rooftop pool had fantastic views of the city, and was a great place to relax, have a drink and enjoy the sunset.  The hotel is centrally located, so once you walk out the front door, the possibilities for dinner, entertainment and shopping was limitless.  When I return to Barcelona, I won't bother looking at any other hotels because the Ohla Hotel is simply the best!",5,2014,10,26
23,"Great location, modern rooms, helpful concierge","The hotel is in a very good location. You are a couple of blocks away from La Ramblas and a 5-minute walk from good shopping on Paseo de Gracia so that gives you an idea on where this hotel is and how good it is for both Barcelona first-timers and for those who just want to be in the middle of it all. It's also about a 10-minute walk to the Born area where a lot of restaurants are and about a 20-minute walk to the beach.

The arrival experience was good, not to mention the fact that they send you a menu of options before your trip via e-mail. Cava at arrival/check-in was a nice touch. Just know that they won't check you in before 3:00 but will store your luggage and when you get back, your stuff's already in your room.

Like everyone has said, the 3-panel glass shower is in the middle of the room so this is not suited for friends sharing a room, but perfect for couples. The room is nice and spacious for Europe, bottled water is complimentary and we even got a bottle of cava delivered to our room on our first night. The bed is very comfortable and the pillow menu is a good touch. Turndown service is good, with a different treat left on your bed every night. 

One of the highlights of the stay for me is going up to the rooftop at night. We brought our own bottle of wine or cava (there's a liquor store three doors down) every night and watched the sunset there. There are cabanas that you can chill out in too if they're available and it's just fun. The views of the cathedral and even the W Hotel/ocean are great, same goes for the mountains.

Breakfast is okay. Concierge is very helpful. Easy to get a cab from outside the hotel. From the airport, take a car service. Blacklane was less than 40 Euros in an E-Class. well worth it.",5,2014,10,23
23,'The Stag Do',"Upon arrival into the beautiful city centre of Barcelona; you arrive to potentially the most unique and classy hotel. With the towering walls, monumentally large doors and gothic patterns across the outer exterior, it is simply fantastic.

The service once arriving within the hotel itself is brilliant, met by waiting staff who will take your bags upon arrival, you are ushered to the reception on level 0.5, where we were met once again, however, a glass of cava seemed some what more relaxing! The staff who booked us in were extremely friendly and take interest in yourself and time here; freely ask them any questions about to the area and they will go out if their way to help you.
 

Arriving in the room to have a little brief down by our bag carrier about where everything was showed us everything we needed to know. The room itself was rather odd on first glance, as, as you walk through the front door, you are facing a glad box shower, which is totally open except for one wall which blocks it off from the beds. For a couples retreat, probably a fantastic idea, for friends to go together, good luck! The beds were soft as can be, with a huge plasma TV on the wall for your comfort, free water and sparkling water on request and you are greeted finally in the room with a large bottle of Cava.. Brilliant! 

The location of the hotel was bang in the city centre; 2 minutes from the Cathedrals; 5 minutes from Las Ramblas, another 10 minutes and you were in the harbour, and 15 minutes, you were down by the golden beaches and beach bar restaurants, which were marvellous! 

We are in (rather late after the nights events had grown us a appetite) so stopped off in one of the 2 restaurant areas the hotel had. The food was honestly unbeatable, I genuinely cannot say anything else other than it is a must try, utterly fanatical on the taste buds. 

As you can tell, and I hope my review shows, the hotel to be fantastic for the value for money, it's slightly up market but you pay for what you get, but with this place, you would pay double for what you'll receive! Clean, relaxed, friendly and accommodating.. Oh, I forgot - The roof top terrace, beautiful views day and night if the landscape of Barcelona! Simply divine! A bar is also up on the terrace, with tapas bits to help the alcohol go down; if that has t one you over, maybe the infinity pool on the terrace will, honestly amazing, go see this beautiful city and hotel 100%!

23,A  Lovely Way to End a 7 Day Cruise,"We arrived at the hotel early in the morning; our room was obviously not ready but they stored our luggage and booked us a tour and gave us multiple suggestions on what to see and do.  Very friendly and helpful concierge staff! Our check-in was great.  When we got to our room, our luggage was already there.  The room was amazing - corner suite with lots of windows and nice modern bathroom.  Very clean and comfortable.  They even sent us an e-mail prior to check-in asking us what type of pillow we would like and if there were any requests etc.  The rooftop patio was a great place to enjoy a beverage before dinner and a cappuccino at the end of the day.  Great views and very comfortable and relaxing.  If I do return to Barcelona again, I would most definitely stay here again.  Great location!",5,2014,10,20
23,Would return in a heartbeat!,"We spent 2 nights at Ohla Hotel, and would return in a heartbeat! This was our first visit to Barcelona, and we thought the location was excellent--central and easy to walk to many of the places we wanted to visit. 
We had sort of a disastrous experience on the train from Paris (part of the tracks were under water due to heavy rains, & we were taken off the train, bused to another location & put on a train there--but it was totally unorganized and very chaotic), so were a bit frayed by the time we arrived. The staff was extremely professional and welcoming, and upgraded our room, which we appreciated tremendously. 
The rooms are modern, with the glassed-in shower area visible to all in the room--which is fine for couples, but could be awkward if you were sharing a room with a friend. Our room did overlook the street, and we could sometimes hear the noise from outside--I would suggest asking for a room on a higher floor.
The breakfast area was nice, and we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast each morning. Be sure to visit the rooftop area--there is a small pool there, and it's a wonderful place to have a drink while watching the sun set over the city--beautiful views!
The concierge was knowledgeable and booked several tickets for us; his restaurant recommendations were also excellent.
We enjoyed our stay at Ohla Hotel, and hope to return again!",5,2014,10,18
23,A Dome experience,"This hotel combines all a city- luxury hotel should. Best location, amazing facilities, great decor, interesting atmosphere. It is quite a boutique, the ones that expect a huge and traditional one - this is not the place. If you look for shick, decor, modern atmosphere, great roof bar, and of course, the best location - this is the place.
The staff is one of a kind, concierge services are always available and efficient, the experience team - I was lucky to meet Jeorge Biedman who helped me in closing the booking, and mutually helping me with the appropriate deal especially with daily nice souvenir for the kids, understand in advance what are our preferences etc.
I highly recommend - though quite an expensive adventure but worthy one.
Breakfast is ok and allowing choices of different dishes, the most to mention is again - the location, you sit like as you are a part in the street, a big shappo for the architects that thought about this great idea.
The roof top is one of a kind, Barcelona is a roof top city, this one is a really unique and exclusive one.
Highly recommend it.",5,2014,10,18
23,Fantastic experience!,"I can't say enough good things about  ""The Ohla Hotel"". I don't know where to begin!  The room, the breakfast, the bar, the pool, and location all made this a fantastic experience.
All the concierges at The Ohla were spot on with their recommendations. The evening would not have been completed without a stop at the bar watching and drinking what the mixologist made us! Amazing!",5,2014,10,17
23,From Barcelona with love,"The Ohla is a wonderful hotel, centrally located, with a fantastic restaurant (Sauc), a nice rooftop pool with cabanas, and excellent housekeeping. The concierge has all of Barcelona in his hand (30 years experience), and he can get you the best of anything, anywhere you desire. We loved our stay and would return in a moment. And a special mention for the bartenders... really, I have never seen anyone make a drink like they do, it's more like a work of art. We soon found out they are world class and known all over Europe and beyond. Yes go, you'll love it.",5,2014,10,14
23,Stylish luxury in a beautiful city,"Stayed at the Ohla for only 3 nights, and wished it was so many more. I knew the stay would go well when greeted with a glass of cava on check in - the staff were wonderfully friendly, the room out of this world (large, airy, beautiful room - 608) - I wanted to treat my wife for our 10th anniversary and could not have asked for better. A special mention to Jorge who organised a couple of treats for us and was very helpful in organising my stay - he even organised a bottle of cava in our room as a Happy Anniversary present. It is little touches like this that make this hotel special. 

The breakfasts were generous and tasty, and each evening started and ended with a drink on the rooftop terrace looking out over the city - so relaxing, so civilised. Nightlife was good, and only a walk away, either towards the beach or to one of the local restaurants of which  we were spoilt for choice.

We will visit Barcelona again, and with this hotel so centrally located, I would come and stay here again without hesitation - truly wonderful, and a big thank you to all of the staff for their friendly welcome.",5,2014,10,12
23,Barcelona's best!,"We stayed a week for the first time in Barcelona, and the Ohla Hotel lived up to our expectations. The breakfast buffet every morning that included Mimosas was wonderful. We had a suite so the amenities were quite nice, and I recommend a suite as the rooms are large and worth the extra expense. We were there in August and it gets hot, but the pool on the roof with bar service was worth the price itself. The hotel is centrally located to many shops, restaurants, and just streets away from the most famous landmarks. We will stay here again next year when we come to Barcelona.",5,2014,10,11
23,The only place to stay in Barcelona!!!!,"Choosing the proper hotel is essential in establishing your stay in any city!  After extensive research I choose the Ohla Hotel in Barcelona.  The beautiful contemporary interior design, luxury accommodations, dining experience, roof deck pool and bar, central location and most of all, the friendly and attentive concierge staff, provided me with the ultimate experience.  A special thanks to Mattheau and Jorge for their efforts in making our stay perfect!  Oh....and don't miss the skillful Mixologist in the cocktail lounge.",5,2014,10,08
23,A Little Gem,"In common with most of the recent reviews, I have nothing but praise for this hotel that is grand on the outside, yet small and personal when you walk through the doors.  We had a minor issue with rooms at the start, but this was dealt with professionally and sensitively to everyone's satisfaction.  It's a new hotel, so the rooms are clean and fresh with modern decor. The Ohla's location is ideal - turn right out of the hotel and keep walking and there's the marina and the sea; turn left and then left again and you come to the hub of the city - Placa de Catalunya.  The concierge service is as good as any hotel I've been to.  With only 80 or so guests, there's a personal feel to it.  Tours can be booked here and advice gleaned on pretty much anything in any language you care to mention. Two minor quibbles: I'm not sure an 1800 room check is entirely necessary, the place already having been cleaned thoroughly earlier in the day.  I'm not entirely certain what a 'turn-down' service is, but the knock on the door invariably came when one of us was in the shower in preparation for going out.  Secondly, I agree with a previous reviewer that the marble steps leading to the lobby are not well enough lit - there was a real fear of missing one and going tumbling.",5,2014,10,05
23,"Lovely, modern hotel","Wonderful hotel in Barcelona.  Great, central location.  Sleek, spacious rooms.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  Nice rooftop and good restaurants.  An excellent choice for modern, stylish luxury. Highly recommended.",4,2014,10,04
23,Loving my stay at the Ohla,"We stayed at the Ohla last week. I have to say that we felt very welcome from the moment we entered the hotel. After a long trip, it was nice to be greeted by smiling faces, a glass of Cava and friendliness. The staff are all really nice and do everything possible to ensure that you have a great stay. The Concierge had some great restaurant recommendations and was always at hand to help us out with any little enquiry we had. The hotel itself is a very nice and modern boutique hotel, with a great pool and bar on the roof where you had some of the best views of the Gotic and surrounding area. The Hotel is located right between the Gotic and the Born area, so perfect walking distance to everything you would like to explore in Barcelona. 

The rooms are very nice, it has a cool shower in the middle of the room, the AC is on a perfect temperature and the turn down service is always nice.The cocktail bar in the lobby, has some very experienced Mixologist's working there where you can definitively taste the love that goes into each drink. Even though they are on the expensive side for Barcelona, they are delicious. 

The only issues we had were the pillows, which were a little strange as one is square and one is oblong. But that is just a personal preference, so I am sure other people like it like that. 

We also rented a DVD and a movie one night, which is a nice little touch. However the guy who came to set it up had forgot to put the TV properly back in place after hooking up the DVD player. So we were awoken in the middle of the night by a large crash that turned out to be the TV that had fallen to the floor. However the hotel handled the situation in a good manner, and everything turned out great. Sometimes things happen that are beyond anybody's control, but it is in the way the situation is handled afterwards that you know you are staying at good place. 

I would definitively recommend the Ohla hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the heart of Barcelona, experience a great hotel and a very pleasant staff.",5,2014,10,01
23,Perfect hotel in perfect location ,"Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights . Staff very helpful . Perfect room given to us , with lovely comfy bed and bedlinen. Even an iPod dock in our junior suite . Perfect location for Easy access to beach , la ramble , tube and buses . Would defiantly stay at this hotel again . ",5,2014,09,30
23,Disappointed,"Despite its 5star rating I didn't think much of this hotel. Very modern rooms but looked as though they had been fitted out with major brand high street furniture. Very dark staircases which I personally found a bit dangerous. Staff in general were polite and helpful, drinks were expensive although the bar staff made some wicked cocktails. Wouldn't go back",3,2014,09,30
23,Lovely design hotel,"Gorgeous grand building from,the outside, on entering the hotel, dark flooring and walls with trendy furnishings, and funky lighting. up to the reception which are desks where u get a personal service rather than a large reception desk. Room was gorgeous, black flooring in bathroom area, sleek shower area, nice powerful shower too! Wooden flooring in bedroom area, with a little sofa, desk area, iPod speaker in the room along with a flatscreen tv as well (never turned it on though!)
The rooftop terrace was the place for us, we went to barcelona to relax without the kids for 2 nights, luckily it was lovely and sunny in the days and we sunbathed a lot! Pool is like a fish tank! Nice modern area to relax in though. Cocktails, drinks and snacks available here too. hotel very central to gothic and el born areas, so great location!",4,2014,09,29
23,Perfection,"My wife and I do not get to go away much since having kids so for our 5th wedding anniversary we chose to go to Barcelona. Choice of hotel was really important as we didn't want to waste our time away and enjoy it to the max!!  The Ohla was everything it was described as , in fact we were more than impressed with our stay, the staff were excellent, George the concierge was ever so helpful.
The pool is stunning and the cocktails were so tasty but a little bit expensive (but worth it!!)
Best hotel i have stayed in, better than the Metropolitan in Park Lane London.

23,"Good hotel, but not 5 star","The Ohla hotel is very well located in the center of Barcelona. The location couldn't be better.
The hotel is mostly nice but there are a few shortcomings. For instance, there is no bathroom door, which leaves little intimacy to the person using it. Taking a shower is a bit like doing a peep show.
In addition, the service (bar, restaurant, concierge,...) is not what you would expect in a 5 star hotel and certainly far removed from that offered in other 5 star hotels in Barcelona (with the exception of the gym/spa, where the service was perfect).
The food in the gastrobar is really good.",4,2014,09,27
23,Wonderfull experience,We have been to many hotels. Not one of them came close to ohla when it comes to attention to details and amazing service. Every little thing is designed to maximize your experience. Butyfull design to the smallest details. Service is impeckable. Fascilities are great. Highly recommended. I am sure we will be visiting again.,5,2014,09,26
23,"Ohla, hola!","We enjoyed our 4 days at the Ohla Hotel. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Our meals/dinners at the gastrobar and at SAUC were excellent. Loved the food. In spite of being at such a central location, our room was very quiet and the bed comfortable. Being in a nicely and subtlety scented room almost made us forget that we were in a big city hotel and not in the country side. Best of all was the roof top pool and bar, we rested our tired feet up there everyday. The drinks were well made and, again, the staff at the pool area were wonderful.",5,2014,09,18
23,Not a single complaint !,"We had a junior suite at the front on the 3rd floor. It was so quiet and peaceful, it was as if we were the only guests in the hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the room was a delight in terms of space and design. The staff were a pleasure to deal with and nothing was too much trouble. The location is fantastic near most of the major attractions. We really found that the staff go out their way to be as helpful as possible",5,2014,09,16
23,An Oasis in Barcelona,"We spent five nights at the Ohla in September, and found that the staff, the facility, and the location were excellent. The rooms were comfortable and interesting, and we enjoyed the modern, stylized decor and amenities. There was some confusion regarding getting the cleaning staff to come through - but we ultimately straightened that out, and they did a great job of making our messy room look pristine every time they worked on the room. 

The hotel had excellent WiFi which did not require repeated log-ons. The beds were comfortable - I just wish there were some more pillow choices, since the ones they had did not quite work well for me and my wife. The room lighting was interesting, adequate, and could be very romantic. The mini-bar had nice selections and was reasonably priced.

The location was perfect - and we could walk to many places - or easily catch a cab to go a bit farther. 

The roof top pool was a great bonus! It was a wonderful place to unwind after a day of sightseeing. I wouldn't be surprised if it was very crowded in the summer, but it was perfect in September. Over all, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,15
23,Boutique hotel close to it all!,"From arrival to departure ... 
Eye-catching beautiful building within walking distance of just about everything.
Welcome glass of cava during the check-in process is a great touch.
Generous sized, light-filled modern room. The shower and bathroom are open planned without privacy (except for the toilet) so be warned if you're not staying with your partner! We had a corner room facing the main road, and couldn't hear any noise from the street (room 203).
Absolutely awesome roof top pool and bar area with views to the old cathedral and ocean. Sure, the pool is small and more designed as a plunge pool rather than lap pool, but hell it's incredibly refreshing after a busy day sightseeing! Then a few cold beers or cocktails lying by the pool ... bliss.
Didn't eat here, but the feature restaurant has 1 Michelin star.
Would we stay here again? Definitely.",5,2014,09,14
23,Great hotel......needs some tweaks to be true 5 star.,"The location of this hotel really is as good as it gets if you wish to just wander around Barcelona,the rooms are a great size and very modern and ultra clean. 
Roof top pool is wonderful and as good as the pictures show it to be. 
The drawbacks are if you have a room facing the main road it is 
Noisy and you can feel and hear the tube late at night.....but hey these are not the hotels fault really. 
The service at breakfast is a tad hit and miss as well,asked the same girl the same order 3 days in a row and she got it wrong every time !  
Overall would I stay there again it's a yes.......stayed at the W last time and it's cool and great sea views but the location is rubbish and I find that really important with city breaks as you don't want to be wasting time with cabs every time you go out. 
",4,2014,09,12
23,Great city hotel,"We had four nights in this hotel.
The room was very nice (Deluxe) with the interesting shower.The roof top terrace was great, a good place to unwind. The pool somewhat on the small side but ok the a dip.
Breakfast was good . Location was excellent.
A little bit pricey, but it is a  5* hotel in Barcelona city.",5,2014,09,11
23,Short stay excellence,Unfortunately we were only staying here for 1 night as a stop over to joining a cruise. This hotel is perfectly located for any tourist to Barcelona. The hotel is excellent. The rooms are spacious. The shower in the middle of the room is unique. The general facilities within the hotel are excellent with some outstanding restaurants. The staff are very helpful and the welcome to the hotel set the mood for a high standard of service and attention to detail. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,09,11
23,Great stay in Barcelona in this very cool hotel,"Very nice hotel, great beds and cool rooms. Very nice staff too. As a frequent traveller I really appreciated the upgrade. Roof top bar was awesome. Pool looked great (never tried) but small. Minus for breakfast. Expensive and pretty limited selection. Would rate as a 5 if breakfast was improved and more value for money.",4,2014,09,09
23,Style over function,"This is a very stylish hotel, but it actually did not work for us as a comfortable experience for a stay.
Not enough plugs in the rather small room, terrible lighting in the bathroom ( putting on make up was a wish and a prayer experience).  The stairs were so dark that they were dangerous ( even the staff agreed with this). The breakfast  choices were very poor.
So it seemed to us to be very expensive and I am sure there are better choices for the price.
The one spectacular area is the rooftop swimming pool with stunning views. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.",3,2014,09,09
23,An expensive stay!,"A well located hotel to explore the city.  Close to the cathedral area, walking distance to La Rambla and all the nightlife, plus onto the harbour area.  The Hop on Tourist buses on the three different routes are also nearby.  Welcome Cava on arrival, polite and attentive Reception and helpful Conceige staff.  Although the rooms are very modern, central glass shower, we found the room uninviting and frankly not to a 5 Star standard.  Our room was a double costing 297 euros a night plus a small city tax making 300 including breakfast. There  was however a good choice of toiletries and comforts. Kettle, tea and coffee tray. complimentary water etc. We both felt the room was tired and in need of refreshment and did not reflect the price being charged.  The bed however was very comfortable with choice of pillows so we slept very well.  Efficient and quiet air conditioning. As we were on the sixth floor we did not experience any noise or disturbance, as experienced by our friends on the first floor at the front of the hotel who had to be moved. .We did not eat in the main restaurant but did explore the Tapas restaurant in the evening.  Think Tapas is a personnel choice and did not excite me although very innovative menu choice.   Great breakfast with very good choice of food and hit and cold drinks.
The Rooftop Bar is great for a city view with loungers for day use.  The pool is innovative in design but not for a swim!!  Drinks in the Bars are expensive but wow can the Bar man make a super cocktail !.  Touch of skill with the shaking and stirring! 
So good and poor points in our hotel choice.",3,2014,09,08
23,very modern city hotel,The staff was always helpful and attentive. The hotel is clean and centrally located.  It is a modern hotel in a classic building. The shower in our room was in the center of the room and this is good if you are alone or with your partner. Bed was firm and comfortable. Breakfast was also good for a city hotel.,4,2014,09,08
23,"Really Nice Hotel, Perfect Location","For location, you can't fault the Ohla Hotel.  Almost everywhere I wanted to visit was a 5 to 15 minute walk away! Perfect when you're only in Barcelona for 3 nights like we were.

The hotel itself is impressive; very modern with an incredible rooftop bar - there are real breath-taking views up there.  The service was really good and the front desk are great if you need any advice on where to go in town.  

I would suggest this is more of a hotel for couples rather than friends!  I was there with a girl friend of mine and found that our room - the Design Deluxe - was a little on the snug side.  Incredibly sleek, clean and modern but the see-through shower was a bit of a shock!  It's certainly not a cheap hotel and for our money it would have been nice to have had something a bit larger but I guess hotels in Barcelona aren't cheap.

The cocktail bar on the ground floor do some awesome cocktails. Great little place to go before a night out.

Really nice experience though.",4,2014,09,08
23,"Excellent hotel, great location, staff and rooms.","We stayed in this hotel for our ""mini-moon"". We were looked after brilliantly by the staff the whole time. The concierge team were extremely helpful and always willing to go the extra mile. Breakfast offered great variety and service. Our room (design deluxe) was spacious, clean and relaxing. Please note there is a shower in the middle of the room. Would stay again.",5,2014,09,08
23,Ohla Ohla Ohla Ohla Ohla,"Yes, this is a 5 stars !!!
Welcoming with champagne, wonderful rooms, from reception to cleaning lady, via restaurant or bell staff, this is a place with high level where we think seriously to stop over again ...
Breakfast with champagne is also wonderful ;-)
The cherry of the cake is the glass made swimming pool on the roof with a fantastic view of Barcelona.",5,2014,09,07
23,Great hotel,"What a pleasure it was to stay at this hotel. The staff were always very helpful and there was excellent security at the place. Our room was delightful, a good range of toiletries which were replenished daily, complementary bottled water twice a day and there was a kettle in the room. The tapas bar downstairs was excellent, dearer than some other places  but the best quality of food. The pool area on the roof top was amazing with a wonderful view. 
It is situated near the old Cathedral area with lots of restaurants nearby to sample.  There is a metro station across the road which made it a really convenient way to explore the city. 
The breakfast buffet in the morning was great with the best coffee I've experienced in a hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and if I go back to Barcelona would stay there again.",5,2014,09,06
23,"Amazing hotel, perfect service and location","We stayed in Hotel Ohla for our anniversary and we have nothing but praise for the hotel. We were greeted on arrival with a glass of cava and upgraded to a junior suite with a complimentary bottle of cava. The room was lovely and the attention to detail was second to none! The pool area was lovely too and we were lucky enough to get one of the lounger areas, which was perfect for enjoying the amazing views with a cocktail or 2! We also enjoyed cocktails in the bar area too, and they were amazing! The hotel is also situated in an ideal location to explore all the sites and tourist attractions that Barcelona has to offer! I can't recommend the hotel enough.",5,2014,09,05
23,Simply Amazing! They simply could not do enough!!!,"An amazing hotel with amazing facilities, great staff who are very attentive, management (Jorge) being nothing short of brilliant and a rooftop terrace to die for. We renewed our vows and the Hotel and staff couldn't do any more. Doting on us throughout the day and evening but also very flexible. Close to the Metro (less than 5 minutes), you will have access to the whole of Barca. I am one to easily complain, this hotel had zero faults. You will have my Business again.",5,2014,09,05
23,I wish I stayed here,"On a deal so stayed down the road - went to this bar and found the service amazing, but not intrusive, reasonably priced, and the views are to DIE for. 

Probably the nicest hotel staff and bar staff I came across in Barcelona. Well done. Could have stayed there all night - Ill be back.",5,2014,09,05
23,Great location,"Stayed here in August, 2014. Hotel did not exceed my expectations but was still good. Very original design with lots of character. However, the lobby looks a bit simple and worn for a ""boutique hotel"". Our room had plenty of electricity issues but the manager was able to make it up by offering us a battle of champagne and after another technical issue giving us a second room for the night. 

This hotel is located in a great location with major touristy attractions near by. 

The rooftop bar deserves a 5 star review- one of the best city views in Barcelona with a beautiful pool. 

Would probably recommend this hotel.",4,2014,09,02
23,Amazing hotel and staff! ,"After much research I chose to stay at the Ohla hotel due to it's excellent reviews and location. I had visited Barcelona the previous June and had thought nothing could top my experience. I was wrong. 

We arrived hours early before our set check in time and nothing was too much trouble. We we're greeted with champagne, our bags were stored, we were led to the spa to freshen up and change into something cooler and my number was taken in case the room was ready earlier than expected. 

We booked the junior suite which did not disappoint and I would recommend spending the extra money. Every inch of the hotel was cleaned to the highest standards and the staff, particularly at the front desk and in the bar could not do more for you. As it was our second trip to Barcelona the staff outlined new areas to visit and recommended restaurants and bars to attend. The trip was made all the more perfect when on the day of my birthday we arrived back at our room to find a birthday message left from the management and a  bottle of champagne on ice. We decided to stay in the hotel bar as it served the best cocktails we had found during both of our trips to the city and upon hearing it was my birthday a special cocktail was made which did not appear on the menu, complete with ribbons and a birthday candle. Both men making/serving the cocktails were so passionate about their work and put on a show with each order. 

A couple of days after my return back to the uk I received an email from the hotel thanking me for my stay and informing me they were still at my disposal should I need anything. Ohla hotel goes above and beyond what is expected. I will definitely be returning in the very near future and will choose nor recommend no other hotel in the city! 

",5,2014,09,02
23,Magical break in an amazing hotel,"We recently spent 3 nights at the Ohla Hotel to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and our Wedding anniversary.There is nothing negative I can say about this hotel,everything was simply amazing.Our junior suite was fabulous with a great view,all the staff were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble.Breakfast was a real treat with plenty to choose from.The rooftop pool with it's glass sides was fabulous,a perfect place to soak up the sun and enjoy the lovely city skyline.We had some delicious cocktails and watching them being made was great fun and an experience in itself.We will definitely be returning to Barcelona and I'm already looking forward to staying once again at the Ohla Hotel.",5,2014,08,30
23,"Great location, great service!","We stayed here for one night pre-cruise - fab location in the centre of Barcelona. Funky, trendy vibe. Friendly, welcoming service everywhere.  We were upgraded to a junior suite on arrival which was a nice surprise, plus a bottle of cava in the room.  Drinks before dinner in the bar were superb - very passionate and professional barman from Italy.  Dinner in the restaurant was superb - although we weren't too keen on the duck cannelloni dish which was very large and very rich.  Excellent service in particular from the waiter with a beard - in our opinion he should be running the restaurant!!  Breakfast the next day was a great spread.  Our only criticism was that the pool is so tiny - there was a large, rowdy group of Brits who dominated the pool and then the bar at night.   My husband tried on 3 occasions to use the pool/sunbathe, to no avail!
We would definitely return if visiting Barcelona",5,2014,08,26
23,"Location, rooms and concierge","My husband and I stayed at Ohla for two nights celebrating our wedding anniversary. The rooms are nice and clean; the location is great, everything is within a walking distance; we were lucky to benefit from the recommendations of the concierge (Mathieu) who was very helpful and provided excellent advice. There is something negative however, one hour prior to check out someone from the hotel staff knocked at the room door and just walked in on us without waiting for an answer, very unprofessional as I was walking out of the shower that is right in front of the door! Apart from that incident, I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2014,08,26
23,Great location and fabulous hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was wonderful. Breakfast was included and there was lots of choices. We could wa
K everywhere in the Old Town and even to Gaudi's cathedral . We had dinner at the restaurant which was exquisite. The 'Chill Out' zone was really fun and the mojitos were to die for!",5,2014,08,25
23,Best view of Barcelona,"We didn't stay in the hotel as we were on a package deal, however,  next time we definitely will! The views over Barcelona are much better than the recommended W Hotel.  The jazz and soul music on the roof top was amazing.  Highly recommend this place",5,2014,08,25
23,Wonderful BDay getaway!,"This is my kind of hotel.  I love a good boutique hotel and Ohla did not disappoint.  It has a hip and trendy vibe and the food in the restaurants was excellent.  We stayed there for my husband's  birthday.  I noted this in my reservation and we had a yummy bottle of cava waiting for us when we arrived.  Our room was on the street side, so the view was nice but could be considered noisy for some.  We are city slickers so it didn't bother us.  As was mentioned in other reviews, there is a shower right in the middle of the room.  We thought it was fun, but it's definitely nontraditional.  If you aren't with a loved one and/or comfortable with your body this could be a challenge for you! The room was small and had a very NY feel to it.  We were fine with it b/c we were there to explore the city, not lounge in our room.  The location is great, easy to navigate the city by walking or public transportation.  We took a Fat Tire bike tour that was so much fun and just a short walk from our hotel.
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  We had the most amazing drinks at their bar made by the mixologists and had an delicious dinner at their Michelin star rated restaurant.
The rooftop pool leaves something to be desired, its very small, but the views are great and it's nice to be able to relax up there with a cool drink after a long day of running through the city.
I think this is a great option.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly!",5,2014,08,20
23,"Wonderful experience, incredible staff","We ended up at the Ohla Hotel by accident.  We had planned to stay in Peniscola, but could not find rooms.  We headed towards Barcelona, calling hotels from our rental car along the way.  Everything was booked, however the Ohla hotel had one room, a junior suite, available for one night.  We reserved it over the phone, knowing nothing about it.  Turned out to be a great call.  We arrived and despite the fact that we were pretty rough looking (having driven for 9 hours to get there), the staff treated us like royalty.  Since we wanted to stay two nights, the man who booked us in worked that night to move things around so we could stay two nights there.  The room was immaculate.  The food was great.  Perhaps most impressive of all was the staff.  All of the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The only negative aspect, and this was minimal, was that the restaurant staff during breakfast were generally inattentive, but that was probably due to the fact that there were only two of them handling a large morning crowd.  The breakfast food was the best we had during two weeks in Spain and France.",5,2014,08,20
23,Cocktailbar Ohla Hotel,"Best cocktailbar in Barcelona. It hosts the world's best bartender 2012 and 2014! Once you sit down a new world of flavors and scents opens up. Best cocktail available for men: 3 magic numbre, woman will love the 'barcelona kiss'. Worldclas bartender Giaeomo and waitress Kitty truly made us feel very comfortable and welcome. For everyone who enjoy's life, Ohla hotel cocktailbar is an absolute must!. (Cocktail prices approx: 15 euro's)",5,2014,08,20
23,Great Accomodation and Location,"Overall we had a very pleasent  stay at the OHLA HOTEL and can recommend it, excelllent accommodation and location... 
the GASTROBAR tapas were excellent and with a good ambience...at least on the night the jazz duet band played!! 
the CHILL OUT TERRACE is beautifully located, with an amazing skyline...pity the service failed... slow and impersonal! 
the SAUC Restaurant was good as expected from a Michelin one star... service was a bit impersonal and uphazardly not a warm, personal and with a certain ethiquete but a good gastronomic experience... 
in contrast to the average service overall the Ohla Boutique Bar scored an ""excellent"" on service, friendly and efficient...

Overall A VERY PLEASENT STAY",4,2014,08,20
23,Great hotel and service! ,"We stayed there for 4 days. Best part - middle of the city, great rooms, excellent service, breakfast spread is good (esp. for us being vegetarian).
The hotel staff is really nice! They guide you very well and i remember one of them dropping us off to the midway so that we dont have any problem in locating the restaurant.
Not very exciting- swimming pool, no bathtub and evening bar menu.",4,2014,08,19
23,A great design hotel in an excellent location,"For me, it embodies a perfect marriage between luxury and design hotel. The minute you step out of your taxi you will notice many eyes on you. And that’s not the concierge and bellboy’s eyes I’m talking about. It is the thousands of eyes which cover the classic façade of the building, that are part of the artistic design from the conceptual brainchild of this art piece, Frederic Amat.
 
The 74-room hotel features a rooftop swimming pool, a Michelin starred restaurant, Sauc, a Gastrobar, and a Boutique bar featuring one of the world’s top bartenders. If that isn’t enough to sway you, than its unbeatable location will. It only takes a two minute walk through a quaint, bright alleyway to the Las Ramblas.
 
I was fortunate enough to stay in a Junior Suite at the Ohla Barcelona. This oversized suite features an open-plan bedroom, sitting area and bathroom which is uninterrupted by doors. The bathroom features a separate shower and bath and double sink. The chic colour scheme gives the historic hotel a very modern feel. The room is equipped with all the modern technologies a traveller needs, including cable television. The bed is super comfy and allows for a good night’s rest after a long day of travels. The entire room exudes modern elegance and is a true sanctuary to return to after braving the busy and electric streets of Barcelona.

23,Ohla.....Ohla!,"Our second stay at the Ohla was all that was expected and more. The friendliness of staff on arrival added to the welcome glasses of cava on the roof terrace whilst waiting for our rooms to be available was fantastic. Breakfast was excellent with a great buffet selection of fruit, cereals, pastries, cold meats and cheeses plus an Omelette of your choice if required. Both bars are small but have their own charm especially the one on the roof top which has an amazing view of Barcelona at night - a great place for cocktails. The Ohla is situated near the Gothic quarter and a couple of minutes walk from Barcelona Cathedral square also restaurants and bars and has the added advantage of a small rooftop pool to cool off after sightseeing. Loved it...will be back.",5,2014,08,18
23,Superb all round,"We stayed at Ohla for 5 nights and were impressed even before we arrived. A few days before arriving we received an email from the hotel with options for pillows and linens, aromas and other additional requests. 
We had an early flight so arrived in Barcelona mid morning. We were able to do all the check in formalities and leave our bags as soon as we arrived which gave us most of the day free to begin exploring a fabulous city.
The roof top terrace is a great place to chill with a cold beer or glass of cava after a long day seeing the numerous sights of Barcelona and the surrounding area. Mid August is very warm so the cooler evening air on the eight floor terrace is very welcoming. However if you find the terrace is not your scene then the ground floor bar area will be the place to spend a pleasant evening sampling the amazing selection of cocktails. 
Breakfast is a buffet with a selection of local meats plus cheeses, breads, pastries, cereals and fruit. You can also request your choice of egg or pancakes. There are various juices, teas and coffee and cava which just makes your breakfast that extra bit special. (The cava is free!)
Our room was spotless and we quickly discovered that if we had used the towels for a pre dinner shower when we returned later in the evening the bathroom was cleaned and restocked. Very impressive service.
The only negative point I would suggest is the price of the cocktails but at 15 euros they are probably no more expensive than you would find in any hotel.
A great hotel with attentive and welcoming staff. We will definitely return",5,2014,08,12
23,Ideal City Break Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and every day was faultless.
From our arrival check in, presented with a glass of cava to settle us in, to the gorgeous roof top terrace (very Sex and The City'esque) there was not one part of the hotel I could fault.
The room was very chic, with a shower in the centre of the room, the biggest, most comfortable bed and great air con! Considering we were near a main road, there was no traffic interference.
The hotel is in a great location with great access to the metro just over the road, the gothic quarter a short walk away and high street shops just around the corner.
Breakfast in the hotel was lovely and varied. From pastries to cereals, fresh fruit & yoghurt to cooked breakfast, everything was of great quality and fresh. The choice of fresh juices was great too.
We didn't actually eat in the hotel restaurants as we were always out and about but we heard rave reviews from other residents.
The roof top terrace is small but perfectly formed. There's a narrow pool down the middle which is more of a focal point than a pool that could be used extensively but to be honest - who goes to Barcelona to do an Olympic swim when there's so much to see? There are comfy alcove seats that are quite difficult to get but there are other sun loungers and chairs around to sit on. We did nearly pass out when we asked at reception if we could reserve the comfy seats. We were told we could pay 150 euros to secure a seat. We thought he was joking at first and then he said you also get a bottle of champagne in that price. What if you don't drink? Thankfully we didn't fall for that and realised that as a seating area became free and it didn't have a reserve sign you could just sit there. So don't pay any unnecessary, obscene amount for something you can get free.
That is my only negative about the hotel though. I would definitely stay there again! Thanks for making our stay a really special one.",5,2014,08,12
23,Brilliant hotel,"We booked the hotel as part of a mr and mrs smith deal. 

It is of an exceptional quality. As it was our anniversary we had a junior suite which had a good view of the city and was on the corner of the building, with loads of light from two aspects. 

The location in the gothic quarter was great; close to many museums and a park without being right in the hustle and bustle of La Rambla. It was very close to the Palau de la musica Catalana, where we enjoyed a concert and the theatre also has a very nice bar which we frequented. Also within walking distance of nice tapas bars, and very close the metro stop.

The hotel also has a rooftop pool and bar, which gets busy in the day so be sure to get there early if you want to make use of it. We also had a drink there in the evening; it has a really good atmosphere. 

When we return to Barcelona it will be very difficult not to stay here again! Hotel Ohla is a real gem and is highly recommended.",5,2014,08,11
23,Best choice in Barcelona,"We stayed here for 5 nights after reading all the good reviews and the hotel did not dissappoint! The location is superbe; bang on in the middle of the main streets, close to all the sights and the beach.
Rooftop pool was perfect in the heat. Yes, if you did arrive late afternoon, there was hardly ever space left on loungers, however, we always felt comfortable to just drop off towels wherever and have a swim anyway - so did many other guests. If we came in the morning, there was always enough space.

Our room got upgraded which was great, breakfast was good and service on top level; always accommodating and friendly yet never too much.
The hotel had such a great boutique vibe, very personal and we really loved that in a big, vibrant city as Barcelona.

Fantastic choice!!",5,2014,08,10
23,"Ooh la la, Ohla - trendy boutique hotel","In keeping with Barcelona's hip vibe and it's history of unique architecture, this hotel intends to fit right in, as you can probably tell from website. Interiors = sleek, chrome, and dark with exposed light bulbs. This is especially true of small lobby, bar area and attached restaurant. When going to restroom, I was almost lost in a black marble and corrugated walls maze. However the restaurant with windows on to the street is much brighter as are the rooms which are clean, crisp white and very comfortable. Likewise for the bathroom which is roomy, well designed and well stocked. The staff were friendly and very helpful and cheerfully sent packages back to US for us!  The hotel's location is about two blocks from the old/gothic quarter (which was quite crowded) and about a 15 minute walk from the harbor area/oceanfront. When you need a break, head to the roof top pool (all glass) and grab a drink and check out the cool guests and view. Pool closes at 6:30 and the deck opens up to bar.",4,2014,08,10
23,Perfect stay,We had a great stay here. The staff were welcoming and friendly. The room was spotless and luxurious. A great spot to walk around the sights of Barcelona. The rooftop pool and terrace were a perfect resting spot after a hot day sight seeing. We would definitely return.,5,2014,08,07
23,Great for families,"My husband, two children and I had a wonderful experience at Ohla. The staff could not be more helpful and accommodating of our family. Our room was spacious and they provided cribs for our two children. Breakfast was delicious and the roof top pool has beautiful views of the city. It's in a great location close to shops and restaurants.",5,2014,08,07
23,Not 5* service,"Just returned from our honeymoon at this hotel. They really couldn't have cared any less! We arrived at 11.30 and as  rooms are supposed to be ready at 3pm we wern't too concerned, the receptionist took a mobile number and said she would call us as soon as it was ready. It was a very hot day so we went for an average lunch in the gastrobar downstairs and wandered around a little. At 3pm we went back to the reception as we hadn't had a call, no, still not ready. We were offered complimentary drinks in roof top bar while we waited which we took happily. It was 3.45 before the receptionist  came with our key. Nobody showed us around, we were just given the key. The room, a junior suite was very nice and spacious, floor to ceiling windows and a very cool 
bathroom. The service at this hotel let's it down very badly, if you need a taxi you are told to go on the street and get one, I have never stayed in a 5* hotel where they don't hail taxis for you. The roof top is absolutely tiny and the floor and tables filthy. On the Saturday night the said bar was closed when we wanted to have a drink after our meal in the much acclaimed (why?) Sauc restaurant, when I asked the concierge why he said because it had been raining earlier, it had, 
briefly, hours before. We stayed for 4 nights and whenever we entered the hotel (4 or 5 times a day) the concierge failed to recognise us on each occasion and asked if they could help. A good hotel makes sure all guests a recognised throughout the hotel from day one and treated with the utmost respect. In summary room gorgeous service very, very poor.",3,2014,08,06
23,Perfect location!,"Walking distance to stores, bakeries, and restaurants. Don't forget to hit la boqueria! You will be there every day I promise! It's a lovely short walk from the hotel. This place is very modern and clean and the staff helpful. As everyone else says the rooftop is lovely and the drinks are well prepared. The restaurant near the lobby is also very good! ",5,2014,08,05
23,Very comfortable and convenient,"My husband and 18 year old son stayed here for 4 nights. The location is great and the room very comfortable, but the best part was the staff who couldn't do enough for us. When my 18 year old got sick, George had chicken broth delivered to the room without our even asking, and it wasn't on the room service menu! My only criticism is that the bathroom is completely open to the bedroom-- shower included! Which made it very difficult to have privacy. If all the rooms are like that, which we were told is the case, it's not the best choice for families.",5,2014,08,05
23,Amazing hotel to explore Barcelona,"Great hotel, a bit expensive, but worth it. Stayed there 2 nights before or med cruise. Everything about the hotel is great.  Maybe breakfast needs more variety, gets boring after first day.the location is excellent. Concierge team very helpful .",5,2014,08,05
23,Fabulous hotel in a great central location,"Great quality hotel, fantastic service, great food.  The rooftop pool and bar and terrace is lovely but did get a little busy. The rooms are very modern and well equipped. The completely see through  freestanding glass shower enclosure may come as a surprise to some !  The hotel is in the Gothic area but has great transport links to all the other areas. It was an easy walk to the port area and to the many atmospheric squares in the old quarter.  The staff were courteous, friendly and very helpful. Excellent breakfast buffet.",5,2014,08,05
23,Amazing location and roof terrace pool!,"We are truly delighted to have stayed at this hotel.

A few blips on our first day and they were all sorted.

We had the dome suite........Amazing!
Complete with balcony overlooking the Gothic area and only a few steps to the roof pool and chill area!

Breakfast is buffet style but with some Cooked elements available....not really what you expect from a five star.

Well done Jorge for making us so welcome.",4,2014,08,04
23,Great hotel in fantastic location ,We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights on the way to ibiza having cancelled our booking at the overpriced W hotel. We were not disappointed as the hotel offers great value with very good and helpful service in the central of Barcelona. The cocktail bar is also well worth a visit as whilst it is quiet the cocktails were very innovative . Def return visit. ,4,2014,08,03
23,Loved it,Spent 3 nights here-loved the rooftop terrace bar. Would recommend a suite. Not so keen on the breakfast-should be better for a hotel of this type. Location is superb. Pricey but worth it a a treat. Overall recommend.,5,2014,08,01
23,"Quirky, chic and friendly","My partner and I recently returned from a 9 night stay at Ohla and apart from a few minor details cannot fault this wonderful hotel. From the moment we booked our stay we were met with pleasant, friendly staff who were happy to help us gain the most from our stay. 

We stayed in the junior suite which was spacious and modern and I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a little more room. The rooftop which includes a pool, bar and comfortable booths, as well as skyline views of the city is an obvious plus point, and we enjoyed spending time there at various points throughout the day both to sunbathe or recline with a cocktail. The hotel is in a terrific location to use as a base for exploring the city and within walking distance to most sites. 

A few negatives are that while we were happy with the breakfast offering, we felt that more options should have been available in a 5-star hotel even if this meant at an additional cost. We were also disappointed at being turned away for lunch one afternoon at the gastrobar and felt that we should have been advised that bookings are essential, particularly as we were long-staying guests. Another small point was the fact that on a few occasions our room was not cleaned until late afternoon which could have been inconvenient for some. 

Overall we had a fantastic stay and we will definitely return in the future. We would also like to Jorge for helping us to arrange our stay and taking the time to give us a tour of the amazing dome suite.",4,2014,07,31
23,Good but a little overpriced ,"The service was for the most part good, with the staff at the restaurants being particularly friendly. We were fortunate to get a lunch reservation at sauc restaurant which I would highly recommend. Sometimes the staff in the lobby were not quite so welcoming. The check in and out also was a pain free process. I was pleased to note there was free wifi in the room. The room was comfortable but rather small given the almost 300 euro per night fee. The biggest let down was the rooftop pool which although very nice you are kicked out of at 18:30 in favour of setting up the bar. The location is very good and close to many attractions and good shopping. The spa is also nice and I had a very pleasant massage one evening. Overall a good stay but I feel that the price is a little steep compared to other comparable properties nearby.",4,2014,07,27
23,Superb hotel in Barcelona,"Booked this for my Wife's 40th. We were not disappointed. Superb hotel within walking distance of all the main sites and ideal for exploring the old town. Junior suite room was spacious and comfortable and the staff could not have been more polite and helpful.

The rooftop bar and pool was the icing on the cake with great views across the city.

Would definitely stay there again to spend time in this beautiful city.",5,2014,07,27
23,5 star boutique hotel with fabulous roof top pool,"We have just returned from a 4 night break at Ohla Hotel.

The hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of Barcelona with only a few minutes walk from some of the big squares, las ramblas and shopping areas.

We stayed in a design room which was a lovely size and the bed was huge and extremely comfy. The wardrobe had plenty storage space and the shower was fantastic. Check in was a breeze and we were given a lovely glass of chilled cava upon arrival. Unfortunately our room was not ready when we arrived at 2PM but we only had to wait for an hour and went straight up to the rooftop pool while we waited – this was the best part of the hotel for me -. It boasted beautiful views of the city and the pool was a perfect size to chill in the sunshine with sun loungers and large sofa areas. I noticed a few reviewers complain about not getting a seat but we were always able to get and we stayed over a busy weekend.

The staff at the hotel were all lovely and a special recommendation to the Concierge who were fantastic, all of their restaurants they suggested were 5 star and in particular recommended one of the best Seafood Restaurants in Barcelona where we had  one of the greatest meals of our life. The hotel also gave us a complimentary bottle of Cava for my partners birthday which was a lovely treat.

My only fault of the hotel would be the price of the cocktails averaging at 16 euros per cocktail. This was quite excessive considering some of the bars nearby sold cocktails for half the price. However, some of the cocktails in the bar downstairs were worth the price as they were made by a world-class cocktail maker.

During our stay we also got the chance to take part in the Cocktail Making Class which was absolutely fabulous and worth every penny!

I would definitely stay at Ohla next time I visit Barcelona and will highly recommend to all my friends and family.",4,2014,07,23
23,Well worth the money,Wow! Well worth the money. From the moment we walked in the service was brilliant! Room was on the small side but nice. Roof top bar views are amazing and staff can t do enough for you. I really don t mind paying for somewhere where this attention to service and detail is this good.,5,2014,07,21
23,Great hotel,"We stayed for four nights and were very pleased with the hotel location, room cleanliness and comfort, staff attentiveness, and overall experience. 

The rooftop pool is pretty but small, and the views from it are spectacular. I would recommend this hotel!",5,2014,07,19
23,Disappointing,"We stayed here for 2 nights and we were so excited based on pictures and reviews. However, for the price, I wasn't overly impressed with the detail. I've stayed in other hotels around the same price point and the difference, and what i expect from a 5 star hotel, is a real attention to detail - little touches like chocolates, exceptional service and a concierge who is tapped into all the little gems.
The service here was hit and miss. 
The concierge recommended one of the most touristy spots in Barcelona for lunch and it was awful. We didn't bother asking for any more recommendations.
Our first morning, we headed to breakfast but had to wait 10 minutes for a table as it was full. The food offering was OK but we'd had similar offerings in 3 star hotels in other parts of spain.
The rooftop bar and pool (a major reason why we booked this hotel over others) was closed from 10pm on the Friday night for a function which was also really disappointing.
We had a complimentary bottle of cava included in the Mr&Mrs Smith booking but had to chase it up as they had 'forgotten' and hadn't mentioned it. 
Also, when we were checking out, the service was rushed and there was no enquiry about whether we enjoyed our stay we were just told the bill and goodbye.
The positives were a great bed and great location so we could walk everywhere.
Would choose other 5 star hotels in Barcelona over this one.",2,2014,07,18
23,I still love this hotel,"We came back for our anniversary after spending part of our honeymoon here. The suite we booked was beautiful, no different to last time and I honestly cannot fault it. The food in the brasserie is great, a very different spin on traditional tapas and the wine list is good. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. You have to stay there , swim in the pool, and then go and walk around the old town. Truly lovely...",5,2014,07,17
23,A chic and stylish hotel in a great location,"If you like minimalism and ultra modern, then this hotel won't disappoint. I prefer something with a bit more character. The hotel was very clean and stylish, but everywhere was so black! Our room was nice (and mostly black!). A huge bed with open plan bathroom. The shower was not very private as the glass was not obscured, but my friend was kind enough to turn the other way :)
The staff were of the highest quality (to be expected in a 5 star hotel). They were really kind, friendly and helpful. The rooftop terrace is lovely with great views. 3.50 euros for a glass of water is a bit steep though.
Breakfast was nice, but I've experienced better in other 5 star hotels. You have to get your own tea and coffee and can only order one cooked item, if you want more you have to pay more!
Location was really good, short walk from the Cathedral, La Rambla, The Picasso Museum and the lovely Born District.
Don't be put off, it is a lovely hotel.",4,2014,07,14
23,Great staff!!,"The location of this hip hotel is fantastic and is in walking distance of most things.  It is ultra cool and the Design rooms are great although, as others have said, the glass shower in the middle of the room is not for the shy! 

The Michelin star restaurant is highly recommended - really special.  I had the suckling pig - the best  I'd ever had. Beautifully presented and faultless.  Breakfasts were good and the staff were lovely.  

The one criticism is the rooftop terrace where there is simply not enough sunbeds and what are there are crammed together giving no privacy.  I know it is difficult due to lack of space but I suggest they take out the white seating areas as they take up too much space.... Just a thought. 

However, the most impressive thing about this lovely hotel is the staff!! Everyone is special - efficient, friendly and committed to giving guests the highest quality service.  Utterly fabulous!",5,2014,07,13
23,Great Location and a wonderful hotel!,"Located within the Gothic quarter, a short walk to Las Ramblas and many other attractions, this was a perfect  location for our stay.

A good size room (unique in Europe) with all the amenities, for a reasonable price!

Staff were great, particularly the concierges, who are knowledgeable and very obliging!

Highly recommend this  Hotel for a great stay in Ciudad Bonito!",5,2014,07,13
23,Very good,"An excellent Roof top pool with the view of the city was enough.

Room were what I'd expected,  modern and spacious.

The location of the hotel too is good enough for you walk to shopping district  and the Columbus monument .  Barcelona 
cathedral is nearby too.

Overall good location and good service.  

",4,2014,07,13
23,Location Location Location,"Perfect spot for the Barcelona explorer. Its located very near to La Rambla but not too close so you are right on top of it. Its only a short stroll to Placa d Catalunya and Passeg de Gracia and a ton of shops and restaurants.

A metro station is right outside the front door and its right in the thick of the Gothic area.

The hotel itself is very chic and full of style. The Ohla Gastrobar has superb meals all times of the day. Unfortunately we missed out on Sauc which is the Michelin star restaurant because it was fully booked during our stay which says a lot about the quality of the restaurant.

The rooftop pool and bar are amazing. Great views of the city and fantastic cocktails to match.

We had a room on the 1st floor which was quite close to the noise of the streets which was slightly annoying at times considering one of the hotels selling points is their soundproofing. 

But otherwise everything about this hotel exuded chic, style and quality and well worth the spend to stay.

The staff were fantastic and only too happy to help. The consierge desk was a wealth of info and help. I needed a power adaptor as I had lost mine. No problem for them to loan me one. They warned us about a large event that would affect the hop on hop off tourist bus service so we could plan our daily activities perfectly,

In short I would recommend Ohla to anyone wanting to be close to the action but not right on top of it and wanting to treat themselves to a little bit of chic pampering.",5,2014,07,11
23,Great Location Friendly Staff,"I really enjoyed my stay at Ohla hotel. You cannot beat the location and the hotel itself is a beautiful old building which has been redone inside. It's not really my taste, very modern but it was nicely done. We got a junior suite which I hear you should do because the other rooms are very small. Our room was large. Loved the view and they give you great bath products. The hotel is very expensive and I would say that I was a little disappointed with the pool situation. The pool area is very beautiful but entirely too small for how many guests they have. We tried to get a seat at the pool about 3 times. When we asked if they had any extra chairs the staff said ""no, that's just how it is."" I was a little put off by this because there was room to perhaps bring up an extra chair. Also the day beds are impossible to get and people go in the morning put there stuff there and hold them for the entire day which is unfair. They should have some sort of time limit so everyone can enjoy the pool for at least a couple of hours. On the plus side, the Gastro Tapas Bar was one of the best meals I've ever had. It was truly amazing. Get the mussels! Staff was great in the restaurant and was very helpful in general. Everyone in the hotel speaks English, and many other languages so it makes travel easy. Overall enjoyed my stay very much, maybe a touch expensive for what you get.",4,2014,07,11
23,Very nice ... Still hear underground,"The hotel is lovely, and great central location. The stairs are v dark (modern) but you have to use them as you can't wait a while for lifts. Our room was stunning like a suite but at night still 3 floors up you could still hear underground so took a while to get used to the drone before you could drop off. Asked to move higher up but had no space but despite complaining they didn't do anyhow - such a shame as loved hotel and pool top is amazing view and cocktails .",4,2014,07,11
23,Outstanding hotel!,"An outstanding hotel which is extremely close to Catalunya Square. A brisk walk of five to ten minutes and you are in the centre of things with a major Metro hub at hand. The staff were warm and welcoming and the concierge gave us masses of information as to how to enjoy the city in the relatively short time we were there. The buffet breakfast was excellent and, once again, the staff were extremely attentive. The room was beautifully appointed. 
The Aerobus service runs from Catalunya Square so the hotel is actually very conveniently located for airport access.",5,2014,07,08
23,We had more expactations,"we stayed for 5 nights at Ohla Hoel, it was nice hotel , but we found a bit expensive for its room size, service quality, and some details, we couldnt open the window when we were in room, I have allergic problem and call the concierge everyday to opn the windows whwn we were not in the room, we stayed in a design room.
During the breakfast we wanted hot apple cake,they served us an ordinary lemon cake cold one, and told us it was an apple cake, the room service  they dont change your bed every day if you dont put a card of hotel, we recognize it last day , they sent us a plate of truffle for appologizing ,it was kind really and teastful.
 Morning breakfast buffet was not as expected as we thaught, the swimming pool is not a pool actually,  but terrace wiev is fascinating, We have generally high expactations after Turkey hotels because in Turkey service is amazing and to hard to find in Europe or Us same standarts.
But nice towels and bathroom , small but useful bedroom and very comfortabe beds
Mr Yves was very helpful all during the reservation and for all. Thanks for him. 
Actually it worth  half price less that its price",3,2014,07,08
23,"Absolutely amazing hotel, so central, luxurious but personal. Great ambience and fantastic food.","We came here for our 10th wedding anniversary and our (high) expectations were met, and exceeded, in every way. From the chilled champagne on arrival, to the delicious Sauc restaurant and the stunning rooftop pool, everything was perfect. The staff are unobtrusive yet available, friendly and incredibly helpful. The standard room in it's cool modern style was easily big enough and well appointed. We'd come back here in a shot, if we had another good excuse!!",5,2014,07,07
23,Fliest Hotel in Spain,"The hotel is well situated and the rooms are good if not very private due to the modern design of open toilets and bathrooms. Otherwise very comfortable and clean with nice views of the city. The big plus for Ohla other than location is that the staff here are genuinely friendly, helpful and efficient. The breakfast is in a well designed dining room and offers a well prepared quality fresh spread with a choice of a well cooked tasty breakfast. Again the staff treat you as a family and the service is OK but very friendly. Great atmosphere.
The other plus is free candy to put in your pocket for a full day in Barcelona.",5,2014,07,06
23,"Great Staff, Great Location","Ohla Hotel is in a great location in Barcelona and the staff are excellent - friendly and helpful.  We were a little disappointed with the amenities in our Junior Suite and they went out their way to change the room.  The room itself was comfortable although a little small.

We ate in both the contemporary tapas bar (delicious) and Sauc restaurant - also delicious, but somewhat ""crammed in"" to an awkward mezzanine space.  They have struggled with the design of the reception areas on the lower floors and the corridors on the accommodation floors are dark and gloomy.

Also agree with comments about the ambience of the rooftop pool and bar - but impossible to get a seat.",4,2014,07,04
23,""" Food Let Down ""","The Ohla hotel is housed in a very beautiful building right in the heart of the hustle and bustle of Barcelona.  The service at reception is very good and the concierge very helpful and knowledgeable. The rooms are modern with good quality bed linen etc.
The roof terrace and pool has a great ambience but it is practically impossible to get a sunbed unless you get up at the crack of dawn to reserve one with your towel.   
Overall this hotel is good but there was one major disappointment.  The quality and choice of the food in the breakfast restaurant is decidedly average.  The portions of the ordered hot dishes are tiny.  It's almost as if they have cut corners because the breakfast is included in the nightly rate.
The staff in the restaurant have a completely different attitude to the staff in the rest of the hotel,  being slow and apathetic.  We ate in this restaurant once during our stay and I would advise anybody coming here toy eat out as there are some fantastic restaurants in Barcelona.",4,2014,07,03
23,Perfect 5 star experience,"The Ohla Hotel is by far and away the best hotel we have ever stayed in. From the moment we walked into the hotel we were treated very well, we were offered cava whilst we checked in and had a letter from the manager welcoming us. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff went out of their way to be as accommodating as possible. The hotel room was divine and immaculate, with the most comfortable bed. We especially loved the roof top pool and bar. Just total heaven!",5,2014,06,30
23,Ohla hotel,"Fantastic hotel!  Very modern.  We received a very warm welcome and were offered a lovely glass of Cava when checking-in.  It was my boyfriend's birthday and I had notified the hotel of this ahead of arrival - the staff personally wished him a happy birthday and arranged for a complimentary bottle of cava to be sent to the room.
Our room, a deluxe double, was lovely, very clean, with a nice view over the streets below.  Despite being so central we hardly heard any noise from the street.  The shower is wonderful!  Its all glass and looks into the bedroom, so not for the shy!
The rooftop pool is lovely - quite small, but the area never seemed to get too busy. It does close at 6:30pm though, which is a bit early, but the area turns into a bar at night so understandable.  As hotel guests we were given priority seating at the rooftop bar ie access to the lounge areas, which was nice!
We ate at the Sauc restaurant during our stay - we went for the a la carte menu - it was very good, we'd highly recommend it.
We also took part in the cocktail Master class - again I'd highly recommend this - it was lots of fun, the head bar man, clearly new his stuff and the cocktails both looked and tasted amazing.  
The hotel is really well located - very central so could walk to most places and also 1 minute from the metro.
We had as lovely stay - Barcelona is a wonderful city and we were very lucky to have been able to have enjoyed it staying at such a great hotel.",5,2014,06,30
23,"Oh Yes, the OHLA !","Our 4th visit to Barcelona & I always like to stay in a different hotel in another part of the city.
Love boutique hotels & this was perfect.  Had a suite with a big bathtub, views of the city.  Could walk to La Rambla, the Bari Gotic, & right around the corner from the Palau de Musica.
Great service & nice little restaurant.",4,2014,06,29
23,Great Hotel Fantastic Location,"No Doubt this hotel is good, but just misses being 5*.  Really only let down by the bar staff on the top floor.  A small dispute about whether I had paid for a beer or not, I actually ended up paying for this beer 3 times as it appeared on bill @ check out. I was with a client so did not want to make a fuss.  Really there should not have been a quibble most places would have given me the beer!! 

Rooms great, position perfect near everything but not too noisy.  Lovely rooftop bar and dinky pool.
Mr& Mrs Smith do it again!!",4,2014,06,28
23,"Ohla is a bucket list experience, do not ever miss it for the world",I have nothing else to say except how amazing the Halkin is!!! The people from the door to the reception to the pool ....amazing! The rooms are superclean... Modern and we couldn't ask for more. The food journey at the michelin star restuarant is to die for,5,2014,06,26
23,"Top notch, uber-cool hotel","We spent 2 nights in a design suite.   
The check in was an experience in itself,  relaxing with a drink whilst the formalities are taken care of.  The room was absolutely gorgeous,  spacious and comfortable.  We spent a fair bit of time on the rooftop chill out area,  because....well why wouldn't you?
Breakfasts were included in our rate, and were  very very good.  We also had a dinner at Sauc, which was superb.  We would sure do that again. 
The location could not have been better,  we walked everywhere.  And also did a side-car motorbike tour to see the further sites of the city.",5,2014,06,26
23,Lovely hotel and great service,We spent a lovely weekend at the Ohla Hotel. Ate lunch in their Tapas restaurant which was superb. one slight criticism is that breakfast could have been a bit more interesting but that aside I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,06,23
23,Fantastic,"We just spent 5 nights in a Junior Suite on the 5th floor at The Ohla and it was so fabulous!
Everything from private check in with beautful Cava as a welcome, to the amazing room with excellent air conditioning, to the best positioned hotel in Barcelona. We were able to walk everywhere and so close to the Gothic area. We also had an amazing dinner at Sauc and it was defintely 5 star!! we would not hesitate to stay again at The Ohla (and to be honest I am an ex travel agent who is incredibly fussy!!!) Thank you so much for a wonderful experience!",5,2014,06,22
23,Ohla  - wonderful stay in barcelona,"wow - what an amazing time we had in barcelona all thanks to the wonderful staff at the Ohla Hotel. Nothing - nothing was problem - the concierge were fantastic !!! They know this town inside and out - we did not miss an inch of this town thanks to their knowledge. The hotel is very very cool, modern, comfortable - the junior suites are perfect and the location is smack bang in the centre of everything = HIGHLY recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to barcelona. Have fun - we did :)",5,2014,06,22
23,You have to stay here !,"We booked this hotel after reading the reviews here and it didn't disappoint!  It was a fantastic location - in the heart of everything.  The shopping is endless with a wide variety of shops from dollar stores to the highest end shops you can imagine - all within a few minutes walk.  There is a lovely pool on the top floor overlooking the city, with lounge chairs and a bar surrounding it.  The restaurant is great - top quality service and the hotel room was perfect.  We highly recommend asking for one of the renovated rooms as they have missed nothing!  Its a wee bit expensive but you only live once!  Enjoy!",5,2014,06,21
23,Superb customer service in a stunning and chic setting - A+,"Unsatisfied with the service and level of another hotel I amended our booking to the Ohla hotel - upon arrival I knew i had made the right decision. Customer service was second to none all the staff were immaulclate, polite and very friend and not at all pretentious or stuffy which can be the case with some 5* establishments. The check in process was delightful as opposed to the normal dragged out routine, we were whisked to away to another area and offered a seat and complimentary glass of champagne in a private check in area. I really liked this personalised touch as felt it was a delightful way to start and end our vist. ( on check out my husband cheekily asked if we could get another and the request was met with of course! Which I thought was lovely) nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the level of training was of an incredible standard. In regards to the decor and furnishings they were elegant and minimal and the menu for the restaurant looked great - although we didn't dine there. The location of the hotel was perfect for us in the historic gothic quarter a mere hop and skip to the action. The building itself was a traditional building with only 75 rooms and the highlight was the roof top terrace; compromising of sofa's, sun beds and a modern small pool and bar. Note the pools in central barca aren't really pools per say and seeing some of the others - this is one you can actually swim in. Its glass structure is a great design feature and the views over the cathedral and barcelona in the distance are perfect. The room was a great size and included a seating area, lighting and very comfortable beds. In the evenings there was a turn down service and our room  was always perfectly cleaned. We opted for of the quieter rooms at the back of the hotel room 202.  There are a plethora of stunning tapas resto and shops nearby and i think I found the perfect hotel to experience this wonderful city in- will be back!",5,2014,06,18
23,Perfect Hotel!,"I booked two nice suites at the Ohla for our Barcelona vacation and we were so pleased, that I could not have been ""more"" pleased!
The location was excellent, and the Cava at checkin was just what the doctor ordered :)

My son and his girlfriend traveled with us as well and they spent many hours watching the ""flare bartender"" master the art!
We ate at the Michelin Star restaurant in the hotel and we were ever so impressed.  I'm an Executive Chef, so that does not always happen!

The housekeeping staff always went over and above.  They had timing  that was impeccable and always did a wonderful job.

The breakfast buffet in the morning always kept us energized to handle all the site seeing events in the beautiful city, and the staff along with the front desk/reception/ concierge was ""perfect-perfect-perfect"" :)",5,2014,06,17
23,Fab City Break,"We stayed at the Ohla hotel in Barcelona from 26th May - 30th May for our 30th wedding anniversary with our friends.  We really enjoyed the stay and the hotel was everybit as good as all the reviews we read.  

The location is central with the metro just opposite, restaurants and the harbour nearby and Las Rambalas close.  The site seeing buses are only 10 minutes away.  The quality of food in the hotel was extremely high and breakfast buffet style with lots of choice and whilst the cook breakfast was small portions it was equisitely presented and cooked.  Julia (who has since left to come to England) was a delight and we had some great banter with her at breakfast.  All the staff were helpful, happy and smiling and nothing was too much trouble.  We had some rain during our stay and even umbrellas were provided by the receiption staff.  

One morning at breakfast we witnessed a couple really lose their tempers at the staff (unwarranted might i add) and our hearts really went out to the waitress because it was disgusting behaviour and totally childish and uncalled for.  But credit to your staff because they kept quiet til the rant was over, apologised and acted totally professionally.  I was really impressed cos the guy deserved throwing out in the street to be honest.  It would be nice if the management at the hotel tells the staff involved 'well done' and i hope you pass on my comments.  Im glad to say the guest was neither English or Spanish!

Rooms in the hotel were immaculate, modern, tastefully decorated and much bigger than I was expecting.  We had a standard room and the air con was fab but also the heating when we had a colder, rainy day.  Mini bars are stacked to the brim and snacks also provided (thou obviously at a cost).  

I had a massage whilst staying (the men were visiting the football stadium YAWN) so I rang down to reception and the concierge arranged a massuse for 40 mins later and it was a very good massage.  

The rooftop pool area is lovely thou the water very cold but i imagine very refreshing when its very hot.  We made regular use of the area and relaxed at the end of each afternoon with a drink and chat.  Towels are provided.",5,2014,06,17
23,Fab Hotel!,"The location is absolutely perfect to explore Barcelona.  I would not hesitate to stay in this fab hotel again.  Our room (a junior suite) was gorgeous, with big floor to ceiling windows on 3 sides with a view of the cathedral in the distance.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The cocktail bar is really great, we sampled more than a few, but my recommendation would be the Sauc (named after the restaurant) - sublime! We also ate in the tapas restaurant which was really good, fab service, very attentive.  We spent our last late afternoon chilling by the rooftop pool overlooking the city.  All in all, the the best hotel I have stayed in in Barcelona & I've stayed in a few. 

The concierge were really helpful & polite.  They gave us an indispensable tip for getting on the tourist bus at a less busy spot.

If there was one tiny tiny gripe, it would be the toiletries in the bathroom didn't feel like great quality considering it's a five star hotel, but this would never deter me from staying.",5,2014,06,16
23,Fab hotel,"Brilliant staff and super convenient location coupled with great food make this a great choice. Organised in advance we were sent requests for pillow preference, bed linen and even what fragrance we'd like on our sheets. The rooftop bar has a small pool where you can enjoy the sun and a sundowner. It's quite small and only about 12 sun beds which get filled pretty quickly but there are places to sit and hotel guests can have a reserved area at night. Concierge is a gem and found us a bar to go and watch a rugby match which wasn't shown on local TV . Would definitely come back",5,2014,06,14
23,Amazing location! 1 rude lady let the excellent review down!,"Loved the Ohla hotel. The location couldn't have been better for the sights around Barcelona, the cleaners and the concierge did a fantastic job. We had a room opposite the road therefore their was a lot of noise at night/morning but this didn't cause hassle. Only criticism i would have is a rude member of staff ( a woman) in the restaurant downstairs, we had a late flight so just wanted a drink but she was extremely rude as we weren't eating! Felt as though we have checked out therefore they didn't really care about our presence! Overall, i would 100% stay here again, the rooms are just amazing!!!",4,2014,06,14
23,"Very nice, convenient hotel","Very contemporary design, interesting glass shower. Location, rooftop bar and Gastropub food excellent. Very comfortable bed, very clean.  Only complaint, bathroom very dark even with the lights on. Concierge and staff very helpful and courteous. We were on second floor and felt vibration from the Metro, higher floor would probably be better.",4,2014,06,14
23,"Excellent hotel, friendly attentive service, superb food (and very reasonably priced) very central location","loved this hotel, food was totally superb - some of the best we tasted in Barcelona (Hotel Arts sucked by comparison) Ask for a higher room as you do get some vibration from the metro  early in the morning in rooms on lower floors. Bed linens etc are very good and you get a choice so great for a good nights sleep. The staff were very helpful and service efficient- definately try a cocktail by their award winning cocktail technicians - it is like watching a work of art in creation as they make them (loved grapefruit of wrath). Would recommend trying to fit in a concert at the nearby Palace of Catalan Music (Palau de la Musica Catalana) also recommend Casa Batllo and the colourful food market.",5,2014,06,13
23,Great place to stay,"We recently had 2 lovely days at the Ohla. The room was lovely, clean and modern.  The roof top pool is perfect after a days site seeing just to relax taking in the breathtaking views of the city.

The staff at the ground floor concierge were extremely helpful with directions for the Hop on Hop bus, which is a must around Barcelona.

The hotel is very central for walking around City",5,2014,06,13
23,Dirty bathroom,"When I first entered the room, I noticed the toilet was dirty. The toilet seat was stained and there was excrement stuck on the inside of the toilet bowl. There were also cobwebs by bathroom sink. I complained to front desk and they sent housekeeping to clean up. Housekeeping said the seat was just stained (yellowing) and could not be cleaned. it could be so simple to just have the toilet seat replaced. But there is no excuse to find feces stuck on the inside. Just gross!",3,2014,06,11
23,"Amazing Views, Great Location","This hotel is all about the rooftop deck. The views over the Gothic Quarter are to die for and the cocktails are delicious! The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed. I loved the gold glittery sandalwood scented shampoo and conditioner. The location of Ohla hotel is also great. My only complaint here is that the food at the restaurant was not very good.

23,Amazing,"It was the second time in Ohla Hotel and we loved the experience. We felt looked after and spoilt by the staff. Roof terrace is definitely worth visiting as you can see the great picture of Barcelona. Perfect location, lovely tapas bars around worth exploring and shops that ladies would adore.",5,2014,06,09
23,Loved the Hotel!,"Spent a long weekend at the Ohla and couldn't have been more pleased.
Fantastic location with easy access to the Metro, shopping, cafés and not far from the Port. 
Great Pool on the roof with exceptional views. 
Room was very comfortable with a contemporary decor and Amenities. The air Conditioner worked well (like a cool room in the summer) oversized bath towels and Complimentary Breakfast (with A Hot Egg selection) usually not found on European Breakfast Buffets. 
Also a very hip/plush Bar. 

Hadn't been to Barcelona in several years and the stay here just made it a very memorable experience all around!
 ",5,2014,06,08
23,Great hotel,"I stayed here with my wife and parents, we had a wonderful time, the hotel is in a fantastic location right in the gothic quarter, the pool on the roof is lovely as the sun sets.... Breakfast was perfect, I really cannot fault it, don't think about just book it!",5,2014,06,06
23,Great hotel in central Barcelona,"Modern interior, clean rooms overall, very friendly and great service from the staff.
Can highly recommend both the Tapas gastrobar and Saüc restaurant.
Also, don't miss the mixologist master class with one of the resident, price winning bartenders. We had a great time and learned a lot of interesting drinks and tricks.
Never tried the spa or the breakfast.",5,2014,06,06
23,Top of the line for a very experienced traveler,"We went to Barcelona for a 4 night city trip.
Absolutely love the contemporaneous style, the superb location, breakfast buffet in the morning and the rooftop pool. The rooms were not large but very clean with hardwood floor, open bathroom, comfortable bed, ample hanging space, safe and wifi.
Staff was very helpful but discrete enough not to be in the way. 
I travel the world for business, and stay at all the usual Singapore-Dubai-Shanghai hotels. 
If you do not expect the often overdone opulence of chandeliers and carpeting but the neat modern look of a boutique hotel, this is a great place.",5,2014,06,06
23,Almost perfect...? but is anything?,"Amazing Hotel with just a few not so excellent points (but nothing we worried about).
Excellent points
1. Location is unbeatable!!
2. Great contemporary style  (just as the brochure/website suggests)
3. Room (junior suite) great size, clean, good air-con, powerful shower.
4. Roof terrace - views wow, very chilled out.
5. Value for money. 
6. Very friendly staff.
The not so excellent but in no way to detract from the experience we had or the many plus points of the hotel. These points are made purely as reference for anyone reviewing and wanting total honesty.
1. Lighting in the room could be brighter. The switching for the lights could be easier to manage - had to get out of bed to turn off feature lighting that switched on beside the bed?
2. The bed was a little hard for my preference - but my wife thought it was fine.
3. It did not bother us at all but you can hear a little street noise - it is a city after all.
4. Whilst the staff were all very friendly a few of them maybe could have been a little more enthusiastic.

Please note - I had to try hard to think of the ""not so good"" points above. We would definetly return to the Ohla when next visiting Barcelona...no need to look elsewhere!!",5,2014,06,06
23,Honeymoon ,"Go for a suite.  It's worth the money.  Beautiful room, great bar and good service.  Nothing too much trouble.  We will be back.
The location is brilliant.  Out the door, surrounded by restaurants, shops and all attractions.
Breakfast is ok but unless included don't bother as loads of places very close ",5,2014,06,05
23,I would go  undoubtedly,"I remember when I traveled with my family at the hotel we loved.   It is beautiful place with location perfect nice of city center  that it has wonderful vegetation where remains peace and tranquility
The room is very amply and it is well equipped.The rooms are always very clean and tidy all ok
The hotel is the most elegant with his decoration very old but equal the hotel is very beautiful and 
I really admired that place where the service receive very friendly and the attention is well all day
The breakfast is very varied and delicious I also stressed the good care of the service
The place is beautiful idea to relax and have fun",4,2014,06,03
23,Great hotel,"I spent an extended weekend here in June with my 11 year old son. We really enjoyed our stay at the Ohla. 

* The location is perfect with easy access to the main attractions. 
* The rooms were clean and modern. There was a bit of noice from the street, but acceptable. 
* But the best part of this hotel is the rooftop deck. It has a stunning view and a nice layout. It really made the trip for my son. We chose the hotel due to this deck, so we were dissappointed to find that it was booked for a private party one of the nights. Furthermore the price level at the bar was on the high side - 16 Euro for a GinTonic. 

When I return to Barcelona, the Ohla would be my preferred alternative.",5,2014,06,03
23,Five Stars But Not Without A Hiccup or Two,"There are many things I love about the Ohla Hotel and just a few I don't.   Here's a short list of the outstanding qualities of the Ohla:    1.   The location can't be beat.   2.  The contemporary style of the hotel and the attention to decorative detail is peerless.  3.  The rooftop deck and pool is a great hang, day or night, with a great view and again, a wonderful contemporary design.  4.  The reception staff and concierge were quite good.   There are just a few items that could use improvement, starting with the breakfast buffet.  The setting is nice but the food offerings are quite limited.  Compared to other five star hotel buffets, this one falls well short of the standard we are accustomed to seeing.  I will give very high marks to their coffee, but nothing else about their breakfast buffet was noteworthy.  The other thing about the Ohla is that some of their fancy gadgets either do not function properly or require a tutorial to figure out.  Things like curtain controls, coffee machines and TV remotes all gave us unexpected difficulty, and there reaches a point when you feel like an idiot continually calling on hotel staff for assistance.    Finally, the rooms, although stunningly beautiful, are tight on space.  Despite these issues, we certainly would gladly stay at the Ohla again, but we won't make the mistake of paying anything extra for their breakfast buffet unless they pick up their game.",5,2014,05,30
23,Ooohlalala!!! Perfect in every way!,"From the time you check in - where they serve you Cava champagne while waiting for your room keys, to the time that you're introduced to the amenities of the hotel...it's a breathtaking experience.  

The wow factor was that this old building from the external facade is truly an astounding boutique hotel from the well appointed interiors.  And they don't scrimp on the luxurious ambience and decor materials of the room, bathroom, flooring, beddings, duvets, pillows (you can choose from a whole menu).  So the wow factor was the shower which stood right smack in the middle of the room. (Obviously this could be a turn off for people who were sharing the room with a ""friend"", but this was not built for the squimish of morals. I loved it and who cares?)

Had lunch at and all breakfasts at the Ohla Gastronomic bar and the food was outstanding! Menu for breakfasts was not overfilling and just the right spread was ""muy bien""!!!

Let's face it, with a hotel that smells so good, service so outstanding, has a 1 star Michelin restaurant (Saüc) in its premises, and is right at the heart of the shopping district (and a stroll away from all other lovely places to dine), this has got to be Barcelona's best pick!

Hands down!",5,2014,05,29
23,Fantastic hotel,"Writing this from the roof top pool whilst sipping my mojito- as hotels go it doesn't get much better than this. Amazing modern hotel, book a suite and you will not be disappointed. Huge rooms with all the facilities you'd expect in a 5 star hotel. 
Ideal location as well being in walking distance of all the main tourist locations. 
Staff are super friendly and the cocktail bar is a must. ",5,2014,05,15
23,Great hotel.,"We came there during the F1 weekend so it was rather hectic, but the staff handled everything very well.  The room was very spacious and the hotel very well located to everything.  The staff was great at suggesting activities and places to go to.  The gym is rather tiny and under furnished, but the hotel's pool and patio lounge did make up for it.  Quite a view.  I wish that they would get a small heater for the pool which I trust would be a very minimal cost to them in light of the size of the small pool.  Elevators could be faster as we ended up taking the stairs most of the time, which could be an issue for people with children, disabilities or of advanced age.  The all inclusive breakfast was great.  All in all it is a great hotel but beware that the price is a bit steep.",4,2014,05,13
23,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"We enjoyed our stay at Ohla the first week of May 2014.  We stayed in one of the junior suites which was quite stylish and had plenty of room for us.  The staff is excellent - both the front desk staff and the dining room staff.  The breakfast was very good every day and we even dined on tapas at the Ohla Gastrobar a couple of nights.  It's hard to beat the central location.  It's an easy walk to La Rambla or down to the harbor area and it's close to the very extensive mass-transit system.  We were also able to walk to the nearby Gaudi houses.  There's a great music hall right across the street and we were able to get tickets to a very memorable Spanish guitar performance.  Overall, a bit on the expensive side (although comparable to similar locations in other major cities), but a very enjoyable stay at Ohla.  Highly recommended!",5,2014,05,13
23,Par Excellence,"We stayed over the F1 GP weekend. The hotel is situated on one side of the Gothic quarter and is ideal for exploring the area. The hotel is clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. This is a 5* hotel and the prices reflect that. The roof top terrace, pool and Chill-out area were great with fantastic views over the city, although the wind could have spoiled the evenings but that isn't the fault of the hotel.
The room was a double delux and the only strange point was the shower being in the middle of the bedroom. The breakfast was disappointing, but the Michelin star restaurant was amazing and worth every euro (separate review).",5,2014,05,12
23,Flawless,"We stayed there for a long weekend. Arrived fairly late on the. Friday night but the reception was impeccable.
The room was very original (glass shower in the middle of the room and hidden away toilet) and very elegant.
The buffet breakfast was very nice 
The view from the top roof was really nice.
Very well located to visit Barcelona. Really central and yet the room was really quiet at night.
But the top mark goes to the staff who have been helpful, polite and smiling throughout our stay.",5,2014,05,09
23,Nice rooms and very quiet for Barcelona,Stayed here as wanted something special for our 25th wedding anniversary. I short listed it based on trip advisor reviews and a sensible price. Booking direct with the hotel was actually cheaper than using the normal so called discount hotel sites. I took the other reviewers advice and booked the suite and asked for a corner room. The room was very nice but the bathroom configuration was a bit odd. The bath is open to the room and sits in front of a very large window! There are of course blinds but it makes everything very dark. At least the toilet is very private through a secret door in the wall. The very effective double glazing means you can't open a window but the aircon was very effective. All in all the hotel is very nice the bed was particularly very comfortable . The chill out area by the pool is very nice and we were treated to a complimentary bottle of cava for our anniversary which was a nice touch. A small gripe was the poor selection of tea and coffee in the room. There was some strange instant tea and a ready made coffee mix with creamer and sugar included which made a mockery of the nice cups and kettle. Another thing which I though odd in a five star hotel was the necessity to use your room key to operate the lift. Very nice but the price tag would make me think twice of returning.,4,2014,05,08
23,Good location - poor breakfast.,"Disappointed with our overall stay. As a previous reviewer states - its not a five-star hotel.
Rooms were nice enough but as colleagues sharing a room we were a little taken aback at the lack of showering privacy! I had to shower when my colleague was out of the room!
Breakfast.  It was a very good continental breakfast although there could have been a larger selection of fresh fruit.  You don't expect in a five star (boutique) hotel to be told that you are only allowed to have one 'hot dish' breakfast option (e.g. one egg and a side of bacon): we ordered poached eggs which came out essentially raw; when we put them back and asked for them to be cooked longer - the waitress returned with hot hard boiled eggs. Poor service (one person for all tables); make your own hot drinks (including coffee) - this is acceptable in 3 or 4 star hotels - not what you expect when paying 5 star prices.
We thought that going to a boutique hotel we would get a higher and more personal standard of service - sadly this was absent at breakfast.
The location of this hotel is fantastic - however we would advise - go room only.",3,2014,05,07
23,Not a 5 star,"very central location. roof terrace. clean rooms, good facilities. good quality food at breakfast. very nice and helpful bar staff 
very long check in process. we didn't get the room we booked and were downgraded in order to get twin beds. very small lounging area near the pool, only 10 sunbeds for 70 room hotel! too much air freshener in the halls and in the room, all of my clothes still smell of it. definitely not a 5 star hotel. wouldn't stay there again for that price.",4,2014,05,06
23,Just about perfect in great Barcelona location,"I stayed here by myself for about a week in early April.  The location is perfect for exploring the city, especially the older areas like the Born and the Barri Gotic.  It is right across the street from the Palau of Catalan Musica.  While meandering the streets and neighborhoods of Barcelona is a true pleasure, the hotel also is right across the street from the blue subway line and an easy area in which to get a taxi.  In addition to a prime location, the hotel itself is very modern and beautiful.  Know before you book, this isn't an old style Spanish hotel.  Instead, it is highly designed and modern.  The junior suite I was in was very cleanly designed and extremely comfortable.  The suite had three floor to ceiling windows that overlooked beautiful buildings and a quiet pedestrian only street.  While the windows didn't open the air conditioning in the room was top notch, something you don't always find in Barcelona. The room had a very comfortable sofa on which to relax, very reminiscent of a sectional. There were several English speaking TV stations, although they were all news related.  One of the nicest aspects of the hotel is the roof deck where I tended to find myself most late afternoons, relaxing on a lounge chair, drinking an aperetif and reading my book.  Lovely place to while away a couple of hours between sight seeing and heading out to dinner.  The hotel also features a great breakfast with a wide variety of food available in one of the hotel restaurants.  But as much as the hotel itself was terrific, the best aspect of the Ohla is the staff.  To a person, each and everyone I came into contact with was helpful and attentive and just plain nice.  A special appreciation goes to Albert at the front desk who was always delightful and helped me with a million questions and recommendations. I felt that he really wanted to take care of me.  All in all, I honestly don't think you can go wrong staying at the Ohla.  It's a wonderful ambassador for the city of Barcelona!",5,2014,05,03
23,Perfect Honeymoon,"Ohla Hotel was by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at. I've traveled throughout Europe and was expecting a small room even though we booked a Junior Suite. To our surprise the room was huge! And even though we were on the 2nd floor the views were beautiful. The breakfast that was included was worth at least 40 Euros each but was free for hotel guests, amazing. But the best thing by far were the employees. They were attentive, polite, and went out of their way to make sure we were happy. There's a super sweet gentlemen that ""manned"" the entryway desk named Albert that seriously made the trip worth it. Location is close to everything and the car service we booked through Ohla to take us to Montserrat was perfect as well.",5,2014,05,02
23,Excellent Location & Food,"Stayed here for a few days.  Excellent location very close to Catalonya Square and Las Ramblas.  Leave the car at home!  Staff were attentive and very helpful.  We ate at Sauc restaurant and that was a total pleasure for us and our taste buds.

Room was very comfortable",5,2014,04,29
23,Birthday Trip,"We stayed at the hotel this April with 2 other couples. We had a really comfortable stay. The hotel was in fantastic location and the rooms and facilities were of a very high standard. The concierge was very helpful and friendly. The breakfasts were superb. Excellent selection of choice for both hot and cold options. From smoked salmon to bacon & eggs! Buck's Fizz & fresh coffee on tap!

We would all highly recommend the Ohla Hotel for comfort, location, friendly helpful staff and legendary breakfasts!",5,2014,04,29
23,Optimal place to visit Barcelona,"Excellent location to visit the town, very central and you can do most by foor from here. Junior suite is a good tip: modern but still cosy and lots of space, ipod connector included,...Pool roof nice to relax inbetween town visits. Customer experience service that was offered also very nice advantage, gave that little extra to our city trip.",5,2014,04,29
23,Great location and comfort,"On the edge of the Old Town the Ohla is perfectly located for strolling around the Old Town with its bars, restaurants, sites and shops. Also for taxis and buses with metro stop 100m away. For the hot season the roof top pool (small) and bar would be wonderful to escape the heat. The shower in a glass surround in the middle of the room a bit unusual and not for room sharing! Reviews have said breakfast is great but would say just descent with better at other 5star hotels. Usual cold spread. Charging €4 for an egg where I would expect an egg station or at least included in the room price - at least the wifi was free but why do such top end establishments try to make such small but annoying charges. Leaving the room for 3 hours was disappointing that each day the cleaners had not been in for when we got back after lunch for a rest. Would use again and keep with the designer room which I think is one up from the basic one. Consierge was excellent advising and helping with bookings - for all the big sites get a prebooked time slot and prepaid ticket otherwise you can have to wait until 'next round' an hour or two later or have to queue in the heat for upto 2 hours. For Familiar cathedral we just walked in at or time slot ahead of a 200m queue. ",5,2014,04,26
23,"Well located, boutique Hotel, and great roof pool area","Small hotel, well situated for walking tourism. Rooms were modern and quirky. A shower cube in centre of room. Wonderful roof area with a small pool and seating area, plus sunning area. Bar downstairs was open late and had all the right drinks. Staff pleasant and efficient.",5,2014,04,20
23,Fantastic 3 night break - birthday to remember!,"After a very straightforward journey and a short trip on the bus from the airport to the square which was a short walk from the hotel, we were upgraded to a junior suite on our arrival which was fabulous. A complimentary iced bottle of Cava was left in our room on our first evening which was a lovely surprise. The roof terrace with pool and views over Barcelona was the perfect place to watch the sun go down. All the staff were absolutely amazing and couldn't do enough to help. Breakfast was included which was very good. We also had tapas at the hotel one evening which was excellent. The location of the hotel is great and we walked to nearly all the sights we had planned to visit. I would highly recommend this hotel and will happily book the same hotel again when we return.",5,2014,04,20
23,great hotel,"I rank this 4.5 **We recently stayed at the Ohla for 6 nights. We had a junior suite and a design room for our children. they do not directly connect, but they are at the end of a hallway where a door can close and create a small ""foyer"" with the rooms coming off of that. that door can be bolted shut, so it felt very safe and not like the kids were across the hall. The rooms were large and perfect for our family.  The only negative I think are the bathrooms.  The showers in both are completely open with glass.  My teenage son wanted privacy when showering, so our other son had to come in our room every time he showered.  If you had a boy and a girl, i am sure the same would also be true.  The lighting in the bathrooms is pretty bad...dark.  Only really became an issue when putting on any makeup...there was a magnifying mirror which did help some.  
The staff at the hotel is wonderful. The restaurant employees and concierge were always smiling, happy and courteous.  The check in was easy and smooth. We arrived about an hour and a half before our room was ready, so we had a quick bikini sandwich at the restaurant and then relaxed at the pool. The pool area is great and every afternoon we went up there and read, had a snack and got rejuvenated for an evening out.  the kids loved it and it was never too crowded. 
My husband used the gym every morning and said it was fine. 
Breakfasts were plentiful and delicious. A large selection of breads, pastries, fruit, meats and cheeses plus you could order off a small hot meal menu and everything was included. the coffee was strong and wonderful!
The location of this hotel is one of the best features.  It is right in the middle of everything. We could walk all over town easily...sights and shopping all within minutes.  terrific!!",4,2014,04,18
23,"Great hotel, excellent service and super location!","We were welcomed to the hotel with a glass of champagne and an upgrade to a junior suite; what a wonderful start on our 4 days romantic getaway! From the first minute, the staff the hotel demonstrated their exceptional service; perfect balance between giving us full attention, yet privacy. The room had a lot of space, separat toilet and a bathroom area with a separate rainfall shower and a big bathtub. The bathroom is open out towards the rest of the room, so mind there is not much privacy if you're not traveling with your partner. We had lunch at the hotel one day, and that is highly recommended! Top quality food, great selection of wine and good price! You should definitely try it. Breakfast is also good, with a selection of ham and cheese, fruit, cakes and fresh juices - cava is also served, great for a romantic breakfast:) 
The location of the hotel is very convenient, just 5 minute walk from Placa Catalunya, which is the centre of all public transportation. The Aerobus, transport from the airport, stops here, and you can easily walk with your luggage to the hotel. And just 5 minutes walk the other way, you are at the La Rambla, and other shopping streets. 
You can also walk to the beach, it takes apprx 10-15 minutes. We spent one of the nights on a small intimate guitar concert in a small church quite close to the hotel, and that is also highly recommended. The church was lid up with only candle lights, and they served a glass of wine. Wonderful acoustic in the room, and just 40-50 persons, very romantic and nice. Another night we went to see FC Barcelona play at Camp Nou; what an experience! I am not a football fan, but the electtric atmosphere in the stadium was great to experience! Easy to go to the stadium by subway, also departing from Placa Catalunya. 

And through the whole stay Ohla Hotel was a great frame around our little romantic getaway, with nice and luxurious rooms, excellent service and perfect location. I would highly recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Barcelona! 
",5,2014,04,17
23,Superb! Nos encantó!,"Beautiful hotel w/modern renovated rooms,  nit,  good air conditioning, bottled water! excellent service, perfectly located (walking distance to Las Ramblas) & breakfast was included for a reasonable price. //  Lindo, nítido, cuartos modernos con aire acondicionado y agua! Además bien ubicado (a pasos de Las Ramblas) excelente atención y buen desayuno.  ",5,2014,04,09
23,Great City hotel but ...,"I picked this hotel based on Trip Advisor ratings and having subsequently driven past many of the other hotels in Trip Advisors top 20 lists I'm glad I did (Pullman is way too far out, the Diagonal in the middle of nowhere and some of the other 5 stars faced demololition sites)! 
I booked the Standard double.....but the room was disappointing and tiny fir the £450 plus price-tag for 2 nights over the weekend! Don't book it. We disliked it so much that we asked for an upgrade the second night (at extra cost of course) to the Junior Suit.... much nicer. It was my husbands 40th and the hotel were kind enough to leave a bottle of free cava in the room on ice! A lovely touch. 
Breakfast was what you'd normally expect from a city hotel but the staff wern't very clear about what we could order off the warm food menu that was included as breakfast. We ended up with scrambled eggs which on day one were over salted and very oily but more like scrambled eggs on day two! 
Staff at concierge were great!! Offering great tips and advice and very friendly indeed. 
One complaint about both the standard room and junior suite - the aircon! It works wonders cooling the room but try heating it up and it takes forever! It waa pretty nippy for a while so o e bit of advice..turn the aircon off when you leave the room for the day! 
The location is the best thing about the hotel. It's in a fantastic location. 5 minute walk to the cathedral, 5 minutes to huge indoor food market, a few minutes from shops and not too far from all the old gothic streets with fantastic tapas eateries nearby and on the same road as the hop on hop off buses so not far to walk to anywhere if you get that bus!",4,2014,04,09
23,Fantastic haven!,"This is a truly wonderful hotel in the old town. Brilliantly placed for Las Ramblas, the shore and for exploring the old town. All of the staff give a personal service, nothing is too much trouble. We upgraded to a junior suite, with floor to ceiling windows, overlooking the small side street, giving excellent views of rooftops, the gothic cathedral and down to the port. Breakfast is lovely, buffet style, with a relaxed atmosphere with lots of choice. The rooftop pool and seating is brilliant, a lovely place to sit and relax after breakfast or before dinner etc. The hotel is within 2 mins walk of Catalunya square, and across the road is the metro, which is incredibly easy to navigate & everywhere is incredibly clean. I can only echo what other people have said about the facilities, the staff etc. Nothing could be faulted. Would 100% recommend this hotel to ANYONE!",5,2014,04,08
23,Well located,"Lovely comfortable hotel, well located for La Rambla, Place de Catalunya and Port Vell.  Helpful friendly staff.  Good breakfast choice.

Minor points - slight rumble from the underground can be heard in the bedrooms but would imagine this is the same for most of the hotels in the area - didn't disturb sleep!  The rooftop pool isn't quite as pictured - but for a city break wouldn't have thought this would be too big an issue.",4,2014,04,07
23,Ohla Hotel - Heavenly,"A wonderful hotel in a wonderful, beautiful City. The hotel is located in a great part of town and close to everything, the rooms were very well done and the employees from the front desk to the valets to the restaurant and bar staff to the maid staff were so very nice and attentive. I have been very fortunate to have been in most major cities in the world and have stayed at many wonderful hotels in these cities. The Ohla Hotel is right up there with some of the best. Congrads to the owners, the senior staff and all the employees for putting it at that level!",5,2014,04,06
23,A fabulous stay in Barcelona,Excellent welcome made to feel valued and special. Brilliant advice available when you needed it. Staff very attentive and professional. Lovely rooftop terrace with amazing views. Everything lovely could find nothing to fault. Extremely comfortable bed!,5,2014,04,06
23,Beautiful Hotel in a beautiful city,"My husband booked our Barcelona trip as a 40th Birthday surprise and I was more than surprised when we arrived at the Ohla Hotel! The hotel offers everything you want and need in a city hotel. Its location is great with all the attractions of Barcelona on it's doorstep. The hotel staff are exceptional, very friendly and they couldn't help us enough from the moment we arrived until we left. Our room was very comfortable and modern and one of the cleanest i have stayed in. The hotel gym has a selection of cardio machines and free weights and an adjoining spa (although i'm guessing this doesn't get used much!) We ate in the hotel gastrobar on our first night and enjoyed a selection of Tapas that we couldn't beat elsewhere (was a little more expensive then other restaurants but absolutely worth it). Breakfasts were a treat....such a huge selection of food that would suit any appetite/diet. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, especially if you are looking for something special or just to treat yourself!",5,2014,04,05
23,Just perfect.,"Took my girlfriend here for our first trip away together and the only fault I can find is I've probably set the bar WAY too high! 

We stayed in January, and it was honestly the best hotel I've ever stayed in. From the moment we walked through the (impressive) door the service we received was everything you could hope for and beyond. The staff, every single one of them, were welcoming, attentive and gave the impression that absolutely nothing would be too much for them. Check in was a breeze (aided by some rather nice drinks) and the staff working took the time not only to fill us in on the hotel, but also of the main attractions of the city AND the best way to get around them and make the most of our trip. A nice touch was due to some roadworks at the entrance to the hotel we were upgraded to a side room (even though not once did we actually see or hear any roadworks). But it's this level of care and attention that really stands out. 

And then we walked in to the room. The pictures on any website you may see don't do it justice. For a couple on a romantic break you simply could not get better. The bed, so incredibly comfy. The bathroom, perfect. The shower (yes it does deserve it's own mention!) simply incredible! Storage, great, facilities, great, wifi, great... You get the impression. 

Breakfast was equally good. The selection was wide and the food fresh. Again service was spot on. 

Overall I can not recommend the Ohla enough. Every single aspect exceeded my hopes. I did nearly knock one off for value, but even though the hotel's not the cheapest, you get what you pay for. And the Ohla was worth every single cent.",5,2014,04,01
23,classy and stylish city centre hotel,The Ohla is a very smart city hotel that oozes style and has excellent staff.  It is ideally placed for seeing Barcelona with a five minute wander to the main square and shopping district.  There are numerous quality tapas and other eateries all around although the hotel gastrobar is as good or better than any we tried.  Tone of the highlights was STphe two daybus tour pass is worth getting if you want to see the sights although one of  the highlights for us was the hospital of St Paul a few stops on the metro away.  The theatre across the road is worth a visit - just for the architecture if nothing else.  Barcelona is all about architecture and style.  Four days is probably enough to see it and the Rambalas is overrated!.,5,2014,03,28
23,Excellent Boutique Hotel 5*,"Excellent hotel in the historical center and only 300metres from las ramblas. Very polite and available staff and above all the professionality of sig fausto; if you do not know what to do to ask him.
The breakfast has plenty of choice.
The terrace has a great view.
The cocktails are served at very original.
 The rooms are stylish,quiet and very clean!
 We will certainly return.",5,2014,03,27
23,Great weekend break,"My husband and I stayed for a long weekend at Ohla hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. The booking process was easy and it was lovely to be asked what bed linen, pillow type and bed sheet aroma we would like prior to the visit! (thanks Jorge!) 

We had a junior suite on the 4th floor and it was clean and modern. Always smelt nice too! We found the rooftop a real treat, but weren't brave enough to have a swim! 

Breakfast was really good, with a continental buffet. We didn't eat any other time in the hotel as felt it was a little over priced. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful and we had a fantastic restaurant recommendation from Daniele which made our last night one to remember. 

We would recommend Ohla to anyone visiting this beautiful city, it's conveniently located being right in the heart Barcelona. ",4,2014,03,25
23,awesome!,"we had a great stay at hotel ohla: the rooms are nice and well decorated, the staff is friendly and competent staff. The view form the roof top is gorgeous and you can enjoy a drink next to the pool whilst admiring the view on Barcelona...",5,2014,03,24
23,Style and comfort,"We stayed at the hotel in March for a long weekend. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the hotel has not scrimped on style. 
The bathrooms are well fitted with walk in showers. 
The hotel is ideally located for the Gothic sector, Placa Catalunya, and the Rambla. Its a short walk to most places. 

Tips: always use the bath mat as the bathroom is a wet room so you can end up with a puddle in the 'dry area'. And ask for a room on a higher floor. We were on the second floor and could hear the trains underground sometimes. 

",5,2014,03,22
23,Excellent short break,"We had excellent service as soon as we arrived in Hotel.  Food was very good.  The room was quiet and very good.  The location of the Hotel is excellent for points of interest, shops, restaurants etc. Would definitely recommend.",5,2014,03,22
23,Perfect for a short city break,"This is a lovely hotel in the city centre with great service and very well appointed rooms that are spacious and pretty hip. Nice breakfast served in the restaurant which doubles a bistro during the day. There is a nice bar downstairs too with a rooftop terrace and small pool and a gym. Everything seems close at hand including some nice restaurants of which the best is Casa Calvet and only 5 minutes walk.
When we return I would not hesitate to book Ohla again.",5,2014,03,19
23,Upscale hotel in old town Barcelona,"This was a very modern hotel in the old part of Barcelona.  Separate room for shower, separate room for toilet, long dressing counter.  We were able to find local tapas bars nearby.  Very near to Las Ramblas, and all the stores and restaurants there.  Also close to the Opera house.  Very clean rooms, wonderful concierge, easy registration.  Close to most of the highlights of Barcelona.",5,2014,03,18
23,In a city full of great hotels - i would stay there again and again,"I am not one for huge long reviews - I am trying to help readers not impress them!
So
We loved the Ohla...why?
1. location. it is central but not too noisy. You can walk most anywhere in the heart of Barcelona and are not too far from the mountain or the sagrada
2. Room - our room was beautiful - absolutely beautiful
3. Breakfast - the breakfast buffet was well laid out and generous - with good ham! and bubbly fir those inclined. Coffee was the weakest point - but I got into the habit of going out for coffee AFTER.
4. We did dine once - and it was fine - but Barca has too many dining options to dine too often in your hotel
5. Staff were friendly and fun - happily taking bolt cutters to the suitcase padlock we had forgotten the key for!

It is a winner",5,2014,03,12
23,Real guest experience,"We loved everything about this place. The location (walking distance to all areas), the breakfast (best we had in years), the junior suite with its tall windows (worth the extra money),the bathroom amenities, the bed and its' luxurious sheets, the rooftop terrace with its sunset and cool views, the staff. It's located next to a very noisy street but we didn't hear a bit. For my partners birthday a bottle of cava was placed in the room. Awesome. It's been longtime that we felt guests like this. We will definitely book again.",5,2014,03,10
23,Weekend in Barcelona,After many years of wanting to visit Barcelona my wife and I finally booked our flights and weekend stay at the Ohla hotel. Whilst Barcelona is easy to find your way around the hotel has an excellent position and you can easily walk to most attractions. The roof top terrace has great views of the city so make sure you venture up if for nothing else but to see the city from a different angle. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms were modern and clean. I would certainly stay at the hotel again but I would probably see what else Barcelona has to offer as there are is so much choice. If you would like to see a few photos of the city visit my website here http://www.jamesharold.com/blog/2014/3/breathtaking-barcelona-with-the-omd,4,2014,03,08
23,"Beautiful, in a great location","Beautiful hotel, in a great location for old Barcelona. The Junior suite we had was superb - well designed, spacious and very comfortable. The roof terrace was a fantastic space to lounge in the sun. 
Breakfasts were great, with a choice of fresh buffet items and a hot dish prepared to order, The Gastrobar produces some great small plates, and Sauc, whilst a little soulless as a space, produces some amazing dishes.
Service from all the staff was impeccable, they are truly there to help, whenever needed, and the complementary bottle of Cava on my birthday was a beautiful touch.
We only a couple of minor gripes, and they are very minor - the lack of an iron and board - meaning that you have to pay to get clothes ironed. Also, although tea is available in room, coffee has to be paid for. Minor quibbles, but compare this with the Missoni in Edinburgh, which provides a free ironing service, and free Nespresso machines and coffee in room. Those extra touches made all the difference.
That said - neither of these would put me off staying at the Ohla again, indeed I will, hopefully soon.",4,2014,02,24
23,Lovely mid-sized hotel with roof pool,"My parents, daughter, & I stayed at the Ohla at the beginning and then again at the end of our vacation. The rooms are modern & clean, the breakfast buffet is extensive & delicious, and the bar served original & tasty drinks. The location is convenient as well. 
Only complaint: one of our rooms had a glass wall to the shower, which was awkward on a family vacation. ",4,2014,02,20
23,Lovely hotel but overpriced. There are nicer and cheaper hotels in BCN.,"Lovely hotel but overpriced. There are nicer and cheaper hotels in BCN.

This hotel IS nice, but for the price there are A LOT nicer hotels in equally as good locations. The rooms were disappointingly basic but the staff was really lovely. Breakfast was good each morning and the sun terrace has a great view over Barcelona. I am due to come back here in 3 weeks time but I am going to cancel this booking and try somewhere else.

Clean nice hotel, but basic for the price.",4,2014,02,16
23,Fabulous hotel and staff!,"We recently stayed at the Ohla for 4 nights and throughly enjoyed our stay. The evening concierge, Daniele Abbate deserves special recognition and a personal thank you. He has  an exceptional knowledge of the city and he responded to all our questions and requests thoroughly and with professionalism. Tell him what you want to see, eat or shop for and take his recommendations.......you won't be disappointed!  Another high note was the spacious dining room and the lovely breakfast buffet inclusive of one hot entree. The food was excellent, beautifully presented and the dining staff attentive. They were always ready to assist me with operating the coffee machine....morning after morning!  The room was clean and comfortable we had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the side street and it was very quiet in spite of the temporary street construction.  The only area that was a bit disappointing was the bar staff.  They were professional, but not friendly and I'd suggest that especially for a hotel lounge a more welcoming staff would be a great improvement.  Overall, high marks for the Ohla!",5,2014,02,11
23,"Excellent staff and room, nice location","Cosy, very nicely designed and very clean room, good beds, air-condition and free wifi, excellent service by the staff, good-quality buffet breakfast - worth 5 stars. Location of the hotel hard to beat, walking distance to old-town attractions, beach, and Gaudi attractions in the Eixample. Metro just in the front of the hotel. Excellent Michelin 1 star restaurant Sauc at the first floor - I recommend the tasting manu with 7 dishes, top-quality food with nice repertoire of local wines served with expertise. Hotel suits both for couples and families.",5,2014,02,10
23,"Perfect location, very helpful staff","We had a wonderful stay at Ohla. The hotel is beautiful, well-designed, and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful, always open to helping you find your way, recommending restaurants, making reservations for sites, etc. Location is perfect: walking distance from L' Eixample, the gothic quarter, Borne district etc.

Since we were travelling with a group, we got to see several of the rooms: junior suite (very spacious, but surprisingly the most noisy - view of carrer comtal, but some noise from via laietana), designer room (interesting shower, on via laietana but quiet), standard room (overlooking a tiny garden area and alley, quiet, well designed also). No need to upgrade, although the extra room in the suite was nice. Breakfast was very nice, with continental/Spanish buffet including breads, sweets, cheeses, hams, salmon and a good selection of fruit) and one optional hot item. Not being used to small spanish breakfasts, we would have liked the hot items to come in slightly larger portions (serving sizes were e.g. 1 pancake, half a waffle, scrambled eggs with one rasher of bacon). As mentioned before, the pool was open but not heated. 

All in all, we had a great stay and would like all of Ohla's staff!",5,2014,02,09
23,"I doubt you could improve on the quality of this beautiful, individual hotel and the service it provides.","The room was superb (we had a junior suite) - it was beautifully designed, spacious and very comfortable. Breakfasts were excellent - a wonderful buffet plus a choice of hot dishes freshly prepared to order as well - and the breakfast room was most attractive. This room doubled as a tapas bar where we enjoyed an excellent evening meal. The service was of an extremely high standard - both efficient and friendly, thanks to the lovely young lady managing the service. The bar was very pleasant too. All in all this is a top class hotel, made great not only its completely individual style (so refreshing not to be part of a big chain) but  also - and perhaps most importantly - by the staff. They could not have been more charming or helpful, especially Jorge. We had a distressing event just before we arrived and he and the staff went out of their way to assist us in every way possible and make us welcome. They offer the ideal blend of courtesy and friendliness. I would have no hesitation in staying here again and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone. The location, too, is brilliant - just over the road from the Pallau de la Musica and an easy walk to the old town,  gothic quarter and also the waterfront, plus there are many good eating places round about. On the last day of our short stay we discovered the delightful roof terrace complete with small pool, plenty of sun beds  and stunning views over the city. What more could you want? Perhaps not a swim in January though!",5,2014,02,07
23,Most friendly hotel in BCN ever,"If you want to get treated realy like a guest: Choose this hotel: 
Very competent and friendly staff which will make everything happen to guarantee a perfect stay at OHLA. Late check out, room service even way after midnight, laundry in 5hours, extending breakfast for 30min? Not a problem for them - combined with a rarely seen friendliness!
My compliments! I will definitely come back! Rooms are spacious and location is great of course.",5,2014,02,02
23,Fantastic terrace and excellent service,"The roof terrace at the Ohla offers a great view of Barcelona in comfortable deck chairs around a stylish pool – worth the entire stay. If the bar at the terrace happens to be closed, call downstairs from the bar’s phone, and they will bring refreshments. The service was excellent and the staff were friendly. This hotel is fairly pricey, but worth a long weekend.",4,2014,02,01
23,Amazing hotel,"Service was brilliant from before we were even there. I emailed for a selection of restaurants suitable for vegetarians before we went and had an email back within 24 hours. On checking in and going to our room we had a bottle of cava waiting for us for my husband's birthday. Really good breakfasts in the morning, fantastic service from everyone all throughout our stay. Gorgeous hotel and room. Location couldn't have been better. When we went around Barcelona and saw the other hotels that we had been been looking at I was so pleased with our choice in terms of hotel itself and location. Don't stay anywhere else!",5,2014,01,24
23,Gem of a hotel,"My first time to Barcelona, location of the hotel is perfect for shoppers and the tourist bus routes, historical building with a modern twist, staff where first class couldn't do enough for us for our three night stay was perfect and if we go back to Barcelona this is the hotel for us...Thank you Ohla Hotel",5,2014,01,23
23,Fantastic hotel in a superb location!!!,"We have just returned from a wonderful 3 day stay and thoroughly enjoyed our experience from start to finish. The hotel is beautifully designed and in the perfect location. We stayed in a junior suite (608) and it was spacious, very comfortable, spotless and well set out. We were celebrating my 40th birthday and received a complimentary bottle of fizz from management - a lovely touch and much appreciated. All the staff were all wonderful and helpful. The concierge helped us book fantastic restaurants, tourist visits and gave lots of advice on the city. We had wonderful cocktails - truly first class. We ate the tasting menu at Sauc and it was a culinary experience. Breakfast was delicious. We had a fantastic few days, loved Barcelona and plan to return in the future. When we do, we will definitely stay in the Ohla Hotel. ",5,2014,01,21
23,lovely boutique hotel but not a 5 star,Great location. A block away from la ramblas. Close to catalunya square. A historical building but modern interior. Rooms are small. Room service is limited. Bathrooms are dimly lit. No bidets in the toilets. No in house movies either. A nice gym. A great roof top Lounge and outdoor pool. Staff are very helpful. The hotel restaurant has very good tapas. Breakfast is good but only problem is you are allowed one hot dish.,4,2014,01,20
23,"Everything great, maybe too ""modern"" for my taste","Great place, steps away from Las Ramblas, very modern room, but nothing inside doesn't look spacious, maybe because is located in a very crowded region and any sqm is fantastic expensive. 
The shower in the middle of the room, with glass walls , so ....go as couple or alone....But anyway, interesting and nice concept. Street view room....means a little bit noisy.",4,2014,01,19
23,Unconventional and Perfect,"Ohla is exactly what we needed after a transatlantic flight.  We arrived at 8am knowing that we would not get a room until the afternoon.  The management took our bags and allowed us to sit in the charming bar to relax and use the free WIFI.  They took our number and would call us when a room was available.  By one we were in our perfect room.  For such a busy area of the city and such large windows the room was very quiet.  The open bathroom was indulgent for couples and the bed was very comfortable.  Lots of closet space to keep the minimal room looking minimal.  Great restaurant attached but so many places to eat in the area. 
 I would obviously reccommend this hotel to any friend visiting Barcelona",5,2014,01,19
23,Say hola Ohla - a terrific hotel,"We spent five nights at Ohla earlier this month and loved every minute.
As Barcelona was the end of our trip to Spain we lashed out and spent up on a junior suite (room 508) which proved to be inspired; the room was very spacious and enormously comfortable.
Our greeting was typical of Spain - warm and welcoming, very friendly and helpful. The staff in reception; concierge area; restaurant and housekeeping were uniformly wonderful. They couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.
Our room was just great. Spacious, with a king bed which was really comfortable; superb bathroom; fabulous view over Via Laietana.
Breakfast was excellent with fresh-cooked eggs and a great array of Spanish foodstuffs and juices. A special was free Veuve Cliquot champagne at breakfast (wine was also available).
This five star hotel is in a perfect location with ready access to everything. Easy walk to Las Ramblas; Plaza Catalunya and Pasaig de Gracia; the Gothic quarter; restaurants everywhere and the Four Cats 2 minutes away. Location is unbeatable.
Service is fantastic; staff are wonderful; what more can I say?",5,2014,01,17
23,Excellent stay!,"We hade a lovely stay at hotel Ohla on our trip to Barcelona. Good food, nice staff and comfy rooms. We used the roof top pool and bar a lot to cool down when it got to hot to enjoy the town some hours during day time. The location is great! It was just an awesome stay.",5,2014,01,13
23,Weekend away in Barcelona,"Lovey hotel, welcoming staff and brilliant location. Before we arrived I had read the reviews on tripadvisor and I would agree with the comments about the coffee arrangements at breakfast. For a 5 star hotel I don't expect to have to queue up behind other guests to get myself a cup of coffee and did find it to be a bit of a 'scrum' for getting to the coffee machine first.
This was disappointing for a hotel of this standard and hopefully will be improved on for future guests.",4,2014,01,12
23,"Good, but ...","We visited Barcelona for six nights in early january. This was our second trip to Barcelona and i need to admit that our first hotel, Majestic on passeig de gracia was a better one. We booked junior suite in ohla connected with an executive room and while hotel is a good one it is definitely not five star. The hotel has very small entrance and for reception u have to go to small area in mezzanine floor. Breakfast was delicious but self service for tea and coffee is not very convenient, especially since machine works rather slowly. I appreciate transparent showers, but washing sinks in the middle of room is not something very convenient. On positive side:

It is probably the best hotel in old part of the city, gastrobar offers really delicious tapas for lunch and they have very helpful concierge. Rooms are bright and kept clean. If someone comes in summer, i'm sure rooftop pool will be also appreciated. ",3,2014,01,09
23,We came we stayed and were conquered,"we came just for the weekend BUT can assure you you will not be dissapointed
came by car from France and found hotel easily and car wisked off to be parked
for us. Reception and Concierge are really helpfull and every thing is really only
10 mins walk both to the theatres and the shopping. No Hestation in reccomending
the ""Sauc"" restaurant food is just brilliant and imaginative......they have one good chef
and the staff super helpful but discreet.
Overall we will be back thats for sure.......rooms were brilliant clean bright and airy and
beds comfortable....would have liked more pillows but dont think we looked hard enough
this centrally located hotel is really good and the staff create a great atmosphere and it shows!!",5,2014,01,09
23,Lovely Hotel & Very Friendly Staff,"My wife and I stayed at the Ohla between Christmas and New Year for a short break away from winter in the UK.  It was the first time that we stayed at this hotel having been to Barcelona on numerous occasions in the past.

The location is ideal for exploring the city, with public transport very close by and plenty of shops and sights all within easy walking distance.

The room was somewhat leftfield with a glass shower in the middle of the room and an open bathroom. However once you got used to the idea it was quite fun to use.

The hotel staff were super friendly and I must mention the female staff member (sorry no name) at breakfast who was especially nice - it really made our day each morning!

For the price, I can't really fault the Ohla and would certainly stay there again.",5,2014,01,08
23,December break,"We stayed in this property in December 2013 for four nights and from first arriving and being greeted by Jorge to seeing our accomadation to eating breakfast and dinner in the superb restaurant the whole trip was made excellent by this hotel. Nothing was to much trouble to the staff who are very polite and proffesional. The location of the hotel is superb 10 minutes from everywhere.
This was our fourth visit to Barcelona and we will be picking this hotel above previous visited ones every time we go.",4,2014,01,08
23,AMAZING!!!,"My sister had her wedding on the rooftop of Ohla in October 2013 so naturally, we stayed there. It was  AMAZING!!! The staff was on point 24/7, the concierge was extremely helpful, the rooms were great and the location was perfect. I HIGHLY recommend Ohla Hotel and would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,01,02
23,Perfect gataway,"We stayed for a weekend in april.
The total experience starts with info mail we received regarding the sheets , pillows & scent we would prefer.
We used the car service of the hotel which was very informative.
The junior suite is very modern , extremely clean . The location is perfect in between la rambla   , placa catlonia , and the gothic quarter.
The food served and the bar is a league of its own.
We defiantly will come again 
   ",5,2013,12,30
23,Ohla hotel Barcelona,"We stayed here for a week in July 2013.  Absolutely fabulous hotel, staff excellent.  Breakfasts were just delicious, one of the best hotels we have stayed in, in this price bracket.  The location is perfect, so close to everything, would definitely stay here again.  Best wishes Sharon and Con Karasmanis",5,2013,12,25
23,Super Hotel in perfect location,"In spite of the strange shower in mid-room, we loved the hotel.  It might be awkward for some. It's location is at the beginning of the ""Born"" district which we loved-safe, hip and loaded with stores and eateries. Ten minute walk to waterfront area, 2 blocks from Las Ramblas (which we found underwhelming, where all the petty thieves are) and the Plaza Cataluna. Breakfast was lovely and ALL staff were helpful. Loved this hotel!",5,2013,12,20
23,We just loved the Ohla,Great location and service! It was the ideal place to celebrate our anniversary; we were not disappointed. The bar truly was a magical experience. The waiter knew just how to put the perfect in a Martini. An amazing ritual complete with an antique atomizer for the vermouth. That was a trip in and of itself.,5,2013,12,19
23,Faultless,"Great rooms, great staff, great restaurants, great location, great value

I have stayed there 6 times this year and always faultless. Michelin restaurant deserves more than 1 star and the Tapas restaurant is also excellent",5,2013,12,13
23,Super hotel,Had a great stay at Ohla once again. We had a junior suite for two nights. The location is great for exploring the gothic area. The consierge recommended a great tapas restaurant near Plaza de Catalunya. We will be back.,5,2013,12,13
23,convenient to everywhere in the city,"This hotel has a great location for both couples and business.  We toured the facility, very modern rooms, and reasonable pricing.  The access to Barcelona makes it a recommended site for travelers.  The restaurant was very special.  Both locals and tourists would enjoy the selection for food and drinks.  The service was exceptional to your needs.  We had a server selection of recommendations that we shared the local flavor.  The dessert is worth the time.",4,2013,12,11
23,Excellent hotel in central location,"Just got back from this amazing property, where nothing is left to chance in ensuring that guest expectation is exceeded.  I was particualrly impressed with the gastronomic proposition and the incredible bar!",5,2013,11,28
23,Almost Perfect!,"First of all, the location of this hotel is terrific!  We were super close to some of our favorite neighborhoods.  Additionally the concierge staff were top notch--they helped us secure great reservations at incredible restaurants both nights.  One of our favorite offerings though was definitely the huge breakfast that is included in the room rate.  Definitely a great start to our mornings.  We also enjoyed afternoon cocktails by the pool--what a view!

Only wish the room had been a little larger, but are very similar to other boutique hotels in Europe, so that did not shock me.  Great stay!",5,2013,11,26
23,Lovely design hotel in amazing location,"I stayed 2 nights at this hotel and loved it. I travel a lot for my job, but this hotel really made an impression. From the pretty designed rooms and lobby plus the amazing bar you have the feeling of being very cool. 
The hotel is located in the middle of the city close to great shopping and food.
Only slight down side was the food. Not the best as the rest of the experience.",5,2013,11,26
23,All round excellent hotel in a great location,"This was my third year staying at Hotel Ohla and I am never disappointed. I had a great room with a bath this time which was wonderful, the room had a nice layout and was very spacious. The breakfast selection was good, an improvement on last year. Service was great, nothing too much trouble very friendly, recommended restaurants and made reservations for me. Overall an excellent stay, I will be back next year!",5,2013,11,26
23,"A cool, modern and central hotel","Perfectly situated on Via Laietana, the Ohla is a modern hotel with fantastic service. Very nice and modern rooms - although it will take some time to find the toilet room door :-) Interesting glass shower also. Fine bar with good selections, and the hotel restaurant is just perfect! Breakfast buffet is good, and you can get a custom omelette or similar.
The hotel is within walking distance to everything, the Metro is 50 meters away, and taxis pass by all the time. You will enjoy your stay at Ohla!",5,2013,11,22
23,Ohla make our Barcelona stay wonderful,"Ohla hotel is just wonderful
the staff and the room decor as well as all the services, just wonderful
the location is where all the actions happen, excellent!
we received free upgrade to designed room which is very wonderful",5,2013,11,22
23,A Cool Boutique Hotel,Ohla hotel is a beautiful boutique hotel. The roof top pool with the city's view is amazing. Most of the hotel rooms are very european and probably more to the need for couples. The bar in the hotel appears very trendy and has a good selection of Alcohol. In my opinion the location of the hotel trumps all other amenities.,4,2013,11,18
23,Perfect choice !,"Just came from seven nights at this great city and this amassing hotel which has: Great location. Modern,clean and the most important with amassing staff. The best choice as far as I found in a very repsable price. The best choice for a a Botiqe  hotel in the hart of Barcelona !

We love the Design room, the size is Ok and the glass shower was fan...please ask foe higher floor in order to prevent the noise from the train below the streat. The rooms to the front of the hotel are nice but remember that their windows aren't open at all - not a big issue ...

Enjoy !

Zachi",5,2013,11,18
23,What can i say....,"We truly enjoyed our 4 nights stay at this hotel. From the moment we arrive, to checking in...to the concierge...it was smooth and the staffs were friendly, kind and knowledgeable. We were offered Cava at the reception, got bumped up to a Junior Suite...what more can i say... The experience we had was a good start. The location of this hotel in the ""Gothic"" area was a real plus. Boutique and high street shopping towards the north-west, La Rambla in the west, Catalunya Square is only 5 minutes walk away. Great location for local day tours as the meeting point is at this square. Casa Batilo is about 10-15 mins walk away. You can walk to all the famous locations easily. 
Housekeeping staffs were very friendly and extremely efficient...any requests for the iron, hand lotions or extra water is promptly delivered. 
We travelled a long way from home and we wanted to try a couple of ""Michelin Starred"" restaurants in Spain, which we did... And Sauc Restaurant, which is on the 1st floor of this lovely hotel, ranks tops on our list! The waiters were very attentive and the food tasting was excellent. Our tongues and senses never had it so good!  
Breakfast buffet choices were simple but ample. You can have your eggs done to your preference or simply choose local style breakfast from the menu. 
The concierge did all our lunch and dinner reservations and recommended places to go. There are simply no words to describe them... They genuinely want to help you and make your stay as best and as memorable as can be. They are THE BEST! 
Needless to say,it was a beautiful and unforgettable trip to Barcelona for my wife and i, and we will return!",5,2013,11,15
23,Hello Ohla Ciao,"I don't have enough superlatives to describe this hotel? Fabulous Great WoW! Just don't do it..........But here goes anyway:
Fantastic style really, every door we opened was a treat why don't I have doors like that in my house why does the whole world not have doors like thiers??? the finishes are perfect, the lighting dramatic, the staff are immaculate and friendly. The pool bar upstairs is wonderful day or night, perfect for a pre excursion sundowner. Bountifully gobleted G&Ts (Spain is so good at that)
The room was spacious and another design treat! the glass cube containing the shower - Amazing. The fine details and again the doors....Ahhhhh
Breakfast was up to the high standard expected the tapas bar is Michelin starred as is the main restaurant upstairs and the bar has a famous bartender who does the most amazing cocktails and a master class to residents if you wish! Of course as soon as we saw the eyeballs on the outside of the building we new we were in for a treat. Thank you Barcelona for allowing this I cant imagine my local council saying yes to that! What's wrong with beauty, taste and humour? Yes I am talking about the building.......
Please go to the Ohla and enjoy it as much as I did.",5,2013,11,14
23,Perfect location. Lovely staff,"Easy to find. Just a short walk from the airport bus. Very welcoming and they looked after our bags till the room was ready 
The room was roomy and comfortable with large TV and an ipod docking station. We would have liked more regular refills with tea and coffee but we coped (not keen on the tea sticks)

We didn't eat an evening meal at the hotel as it seemed a little pricey but the breakfast was tasty and set us up for the day. 

The corridors are dark but that is typical of modern Catalonian hotels. 

It is a brisk 15 min walk to the beach and the Metro is easy to understand. The hotel map was the better than any we purchased. There is also a cheap supermarket opposite for bits and bobs 
A wonderful holiday. Would return!",4,2013,11,12
23,Absolutely Amazing!,"The Ohla Hotel is FABULOUS! Everyone is kind and helpful. The rooms were very clean and filled with many amenities. The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job, even alerting us to a couple of pillows that we left behind! The concierge was extremely helpful, offering advice and helping to print out boarding passes for our return trip home. The buffet breakfast was delicious, with help-yourself items as well as a made to order menu. Francisk, Julia, Javier, and EVERYONE else helped make each breakfast a treat! They are poiite and make sure you have all that you require for a pleasant meal. Albert and all of the handsome gentlemen at the front desk greet you with a warm smile and a friendly ""Hola"" every time they see you! They are ready to offer suggestions for restaurants and sightseeing, including the best way to get there, complete with a map and a highlighted route. The rooftop pool was spectacular in the day time AND the night time, as the views were stunning! The location was ideal; we walked to many places, as the hotel was in a great location! We had a wonderful time and can't wait to get back! We are saving our dollars...hoping to change them into euros...for our next trip to Barcelona and the Ohla Hotel!",5,2013,11,09
23,Fantastic experience,"Every aspect of our stay was perfectly managed and the overall ambience of the hotel was superb. 
Particularly appreciated the late checkout the service manager kindly agreed due to our evening flight and the fact that I was feeling pretty groggy that morning. ",5,2013,11,07
23,Too Dark!,"The Ohla tried in their decor, but the lighting is really not adequate in the room. Dark colors in bath area with inappropriate lighting. Really light colors in the sleeping area. Cannot even see to shave or put on makeup. The glass walled shower is just in the way!",3,2013,11,07
23,Great location,"My partner and I Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and had a great time. The rooms were very clean and all staff were really friendly. The rooms are a nice size and have a shower in the middle of the bedroom, so only stay here if you are not shy. We did have a massage but was not very good, the hotel uses an outside company. The hotel is in a great location close to shops and restaurants. I would defiantly stay here again.",5,2013,11,06
23,5-star experience,"Very happy about choosing this hotel for a 3-night weekend with my friend in Barcelona!
Convenient and very good location within walking distance to wherever we wanted to go. Stylish design, and nice room with all amenities you need, a lot of space for clothing etc, quiet and with extremely comfortable beds. Front desk and concierge are very nice and helpful, Jorge especially! The service seamed effortless as it is supposed to be in a hotel of this kind. Have a drink in the Ohla Boutique Bar, the guys are great, and makes impressive contemporary drinks and classic with a twist! The roof top terrace with the pool is amazing, and the view spectacular. Breakfast (until 11, very generous) is good, with about everything you need. Only thing I would have wished for is a wider selection of fruits and vegetables, and coffe that doesn't come from a machine.. which I believe it does. The omelettes though were just perfect! Didn't try the restaurant for dinner but that will be for next time. To summarize, I totally recommend Ohla, and I will definitely stay here again!",5,2013,11,04
23,Fantastic location excellent staff,"Stayed here for tree nights, beautiful hotel, the staff was amazing, friendly and helpful, the location is superb close to any atraction of Barcelona, couldn't have picked a better hotel.

We ate dinner at Gastro Restaurant, the meal was excellent and  last but not least, Julia is probably the best hostess we have encountred in all our travels.

We will be back!!",5,2013,11,03
23,Ideal hotel for a break in Barcelona,"Everything about this hotel is first class, location, service, rooms and dining options. We had a weekend break there recently and will return as soon as we can.
The staff could not be more helpful and from the moment we were given a lovely chilled glass of Cava whilst we checked in we knew we had made the right choice of hotel. 
The attention to detail was very impressive.",5,2013,11,02
23,"Nice, but noisy","We stayed there for two nights. The service is impeccable, the rooms are clean and well equipped as expected in an hotel of this standing.

However, we were a bit disappointed by being disturbed a couple of times during our stay by staff knocking and entering in our room while we were in, and by the room being clean around 5pm… which seems a bit late.

Also, we stayed on the first floor in a room in front of the street, and the room was REALLY noisy. The bed would shake every 10 minutes when the subway would pass under the hotel. We were happy to only stay two nights there as we still had some trouble to sleep quietly.",4,2013,10,29
23,great experience at Ohla hotel,"terrific location, first rate staff and great view from hotel pool.  we had a nice experience for the week.  It would be difficult to be more central to the most appealing attractions in Barcelona, including the Gaudi cathedral, beaches and Las Ramblas.  Restaurant choices abound within easy walking distances.  Taxis are amongst the most reasonably priced in Europe.",5,2013,10,29
23,Wonderful hotel!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ohla, the staff were so helpful and friendly, the rooms were gorgeous and the treats left in our room were a wonderful surprise. The breakfast buffet is delicious, the waiters remembered our preferences for drinks after just one sitting. 
We had a junior suite with a roll out bed for our son, that did make the room a little cramped, but we were barely in there so it didn't bother us too much. The roof terrace was fabulous too, great views of the city whilst enjoying a chilled drink. We can't wait to go back!",5,2013,10,29
23,Impeccable Stay & Venue,"This is a review of the entire hotel experience at Ohla: our lush 4-night stay, event on the rooftop terraza, drinks at the Boutique Bar and dinner at the Gastrobar.

Ohla was the venue for our destination wedding. We were looking for a contemporary, classy place that could keep things simple for small ceremony in a beautiful city. We hit the TripAdvisor recommendations as most do, but even the highest rated hotels fell flat. We didn't want a chain hotel—we craved something unique to Barcelona. Ohla was just that.

We booked a Junior Suite for ourselves, and several of our guests booked non-suites throughout. We had family and friends on every floor and everyone had a great experience. Our wedding was hosted on a Friday night in simple, private ceremony on the roof (with plenty of cava and snacks). Afterward we went down to the Gastrobar for a delightful dinner. 

The central location was like having a key to the city. We were central enough to get anywhere we wanted without feeling like we were tuck in tourist mobs. 

For those of you looking for more than a few nights for yourselves, know that Group Reservations are incredibly responsive—more so than I ever would have anticipated. They were professional, clear and helpful throughout months of contact and planning. They really made our wedding special—helping to craft the perfect experience for us and all of our guests. No glass was left empty. No guest left wanting more. Everyone left glowing. 

We had quite possibly the best experience one could have at Ohla. Their entire team is sharp, smart, and classy. Our event was seamless and our experience luxurious. We really got VIP treatment. It was absolutely perfect and I wouldn't have changed a thing.",5,2013,10,27
23,Not what I expected,"This hotel is great for the city.  However, did not meet our requirements.  The manager was lovely though and (even though we had paid for a package) allowed us to leave after one night.

The room faced onto the very noisy road, which is great to experience the city, but unfortunately not for us.  The pool is very small and the plastic loungers are stacked up on a night to create a bar area.  The view is of air conditioning units and dirty rooftops!  

The room was big (junior suite), the bathroom nice, but the bedsheets(especially the bottom sheet) were itchy. Cheap cotton. 

We moved to the w hotel and loved it.",3,2013,10,26
23,Very enjoyable stay,"Our 4 night stay recently in a junior suite was wonderful.  The hotel location was perfect and within walking distance to most attractions.  Everything you wish when vacationing.

The room was spacious and modern as expected.  The bathroom lighting was very dim and could have used a few more watts, but it sufficed (yes, the reports of dim lighting in the hotel are true but other than the bathroom and stairway, mostly a non-issue).  I loved how the toilet was almost hidden in a secret door.  My only ""complaint"" was that the room (and the toilet) were overly scented.  I considered asking the hotel to tone the fragrance down but I never got around to it, so no fault of theirs.

We added the breakfast option and were extremely pleased we did as the quality and selection were above par.  There was brewed coffee in addition to an espresso machine with individual pods to create your own cup.  Many varieties of freshly baked pastries, sliced fruits, cheeses, and likely the best jamon we had in Barcelona.  Guests also had the option of ordering one hot cooked to order dish in addition to the continental options.  It was all just well done and worth every cent.  Treat yourself to breakfast and you won't be disappointed.

The concierge was also helpful in trying to secure Renfe train tickets for us as we had an issue with our credit card working through the online site.  Though he was not able to complete the transaction, his effort was appreciated.

Overall a great find and we would stay there again if we found ourselves in Barcelona.",5,2013,10,25
23,Big city glitzy,"Barcelona was our last stop in Spain. I picked this hotel because of its location near the Gothic area and the transportation hub Placa de Catalunya. It was a fine choice and I recommend it if you are looking for a contemporary modern hotel for your stay.  If you like W hotels you'll like it here.
Our room wasn't ready when we arrived and they have a waiting lounge with coffee, juices, water, wifi. I travel a lot and haven't seen that before, it was a nice touch.
The staff here I would describe as polished. Every one of them could be working at the Four Seasons in NY or Paris. Every one spoke perfect English. 
I liked our room. It wasn't huge but not small either. Lots of wardrobe space. It was immaculately clean, comfortable, decent view, and well stocked with fun little toiletries (metallic glitter massage lotion anyone?) And by this point in our trip I was ready for all the high end modern conveniences that they could offer. 
The rooftop bar was closed during our stay. I was a little disappointed by that since the temp was in the 70's and gorgeously sunny. But all the local residents were all going around in jackets so I gather to them that's cold.
My husband didn't like the breakfast. The buffet was the usual but you get one hot entree each and I have to say every one of these was pretty darn bad. He loves his breakfast so to him it was a minor disappointment.
Overall, fun hotel, especially in summer when you can use the rooftop. Good central location, safe location (!), clean, comfy, good staff. Stay here.",5,2013,10,25
23,A beautiful modern hotel with high standards,"A beautiful hotel, artisticly designed and minimalistic rooms and an excelent high-end service. Perfect cleaning and all the facilities incl restaurant and roof terrace was of a very high standard. Highly recommendable and the location is fantastic, right in the heart of the centre.",5,2013,10,23
23,"Great Service, Staff  and Location","We had original plans for a 2 night stay, but we were informed by the staff well ahead of time that the hotel was having a problem w/ some work being done over the weekend of our stay and they asked if we would mind if they put us up at the W Hotel at the waterfront for one of our nights.  We arrived at the OHLA and they provided storage of the luggage we didn't require that evening and transported us to the W hotel.  The, OHLA picked us up the next day @ the W and provided us a tour on our way back to the OHLA.   We had arranged Auto Rental thru OHLA staff and to be met at the airport.   ALL arrangements were flawless.  Rooms were spotless and breakfast was excellent.   OHLA recommended restaurants and city tours which were all excellent! Next time in Barcelona we will definitely stay at the OHLA again. Three CHEERS for all the staff for their help!",5,2013,10,23
23,A rising star,"We were looking for a fantastic hotel with a pool close to everything and we found it. The room was clean and the personnel super positive and supportive. As it was a specific weekend for my wife and I we had a kind reminder from hotel staff, thanks for that. I would strongly recommend this hotel to everyone and once again Anna thanks to you and your staff Br Markku and Marjo",5,2013,10,23
23,Great Hotel,"The location is perfect. In the Goti section it is in walking distance of most things or at most a short cab ride away. The entire staff were welcoming and helpful. We loved the room, clean and crisp. Every day when we returned the room smelt like we had stepped into a spa. The concierge staff are knowledgeable and friendly. For casual dinner try the Gastropub - best green salad I ever had and the if you're a meat eater get the veal loin chop tapas! The 1 star Michelin restaurant Sauc is superb. The food lived up to it's rating. If you're interested, make sure you make a reservation either before arrival or at checkin in as there are limited tables. The service was efficient and warm without being stiff.",5,2013,10,23
23,Superb,"From the moment we pulled up in the taxi , the conicerge was very welcoming...he took care of our luggage and showed us to recipition where we were offered drinks.
The room was excellent , very  clean and smelled really nice. The rooftop terace is a great addition , great to chillout  up there next to the pool away from the hustle and bustle below. The breakfast was included in the room and was very nice lots of choice. The cocktails and beer were expensive that is all i can fault.
The staff are a class apart , really friendly and very helpfull.
If visit Barcelona again i will be staying here without question :-)",5,2013,10,22
23,"Perfect location, most comfortable beds.","Unbelievably accessible for everything you want to do in Barcelona; walk anywhere in 15-20 minutes. Beautiful rooftop terrace. Rooms were a bit small, but fine. Most comfortable hotel bed I ever had. Excellent staff, conciege handled several requesrts perfectly. Clientele a bit casual in the dining room (scruffy jeans, T-shirts), but that's just me. Definitely stay here when I return.",5,2013,10,21
23,Attention to detail and fantastic location,"The hotel is located walking distance to the main areas in Barcelona: Plaça Catalunya, Cathedral and Gothic Quarter as well as many shops. The staff are very attentive and doing the check in on the ‘half’ floor is very personal and intimate.
The rooms are modern and have an open plan bathroom - which is unusal. What is worth to be mention is the attention to detail: ribbon to hold the towels, aromatic smell in the wardrobe, fine linen and cookies for turn down service, etc. And the cocktail bar is a must; amazing tasty drinks! 
It is a pity that it was already a bit cold to use the swimming pool on the roof terrace. I will have to go again in summer.",5,2013,10,16
23,"Great Location, Fabulous hotel and Friendly staff","Ohla hotel was recommended to us by friends in LA and we were totally wowed by this fabulous well located Hotel.
we were welcomed with a glass of Champagne on arrival and upgraded to a fabulous suite  .
our room was spectacular ! great views of barcelona and balcony to enjoy the afternoon sunshine with glass of wine .
Breakfast downstairs was delicious and had a big selection of healthy food to choose from .
staff were very friendly and welcoming .
highly recommend Ohla hotel ,there is nothing we could fault it on .",5,2013,10,13
23,Amazing!~,Great location! Really contemporary fun hotel with high level of service and amenities. We arrived and the concierge greeted us quickly found our room and said (although we were earlier than the check in time) your room is ready I will show you to the reception and someone will be by with you luggage everything was handled flawlessly. We will return to Barcelona and will ONLY stay at the Ohla. The roof top pool is worth it-however the price of the cocktails (albeit clearly handcrafted) took us by surprise on cost. This was actually fortunate as it forced us to visit a few (very close!) great tapas restaurants for the casual night out we were looking for. We will return to try their noteworthy award winning bar and restaurant. This was at the end of the trip and we found everything exceeded our expectations.,5,2013,10,06
23,"Excellent hotel, brilliant location","I like to walk as much as possible around new cities and the location of this hotel really helped out in this.  Two minutes to the Ramblas, 15 to Casa Batllo, 20 to Casa Mila and and a metro stop right outside for anything a little further.  Then after a long day wandering around it was wonderful to return to have a lazy dip in the pool and soak up some sun whilst gazing over the city.  All the staff were so friendly and helpful and booked everything for us and gave us sound advice on how best to get to around which made visiting places so much easier.  The bed was to die for, I have not slept so well in ages.  We were on the first floor with a window out on a little 'cul de sac' - very quiet - we could feel the rumble of the metro train occasionally but not so that it disturbed us - in fact it was almost a reassuring sensation, the world was continuing to bustle whilst we rested ready to take on a new day. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, it was relaxing, cool, friendly, modern and slightly quirky - just what I wanted from a Barcelona hotel.",5,2013,10,04
23,Justifies the great reviews!,"Just back from a four night 25th Anniversary break, and this hotel was just that 'something special' that we were looking for.  Management and Team have got things working seamlessly. In addition, our fabulous family (love you!) had been arranging things secretly with the hotel, so there was Cava, chocolate coated strawberries, chocolate cake, cocktails etc.  

From our arrival we were greeted with professionalism, warmth and courtesy, and this continued throughout our stay.  We had booked a deluxe room, and this turned out to be 610 on the 6th floor, so we heard virtually nothing from street level and the view of the cathedral was stunning. 

Tapas (very special and very different!) on our first evening, when we left the dish selection to the waiter, was a first class start to our break.  Breakfasts exceeded expectations too, everything fresh, attractive, and more than enough (not difficult, but happens in very few hotels). Relaxing with cocktails on the roof next to the infinity pool was an amazing experience on a warm evening.

Even with the need for a little bit more light over the vanity unit, this hotel really justifies 5 stars.

PS: When we left, we missed the chance to thank Julia and the restaurant team properly....and everyone else on the team be honest!  Sorry guys.",5,2013,10,04
23,excellent hotel,"such a great hotel.
excellent location.. central to the city and close to the beach..
Staff were so friendly and helpful.  Concierge gave so many great ideas for places to go.. 
My room was comfortable and I had everything I needed.  
The small pool at the top of the building was really great, small but refreshing. Lovely views.
I had lunch at Sauc restaurant ... It was absolutely brilliant. great service and fantastic food.",5,2013,10,03
23,"Really good hotel, great restaurant and amazing bar","I loved this hotel. The room is incredibly comfortable with great air conditioning. The shower separating the room from the bathroom area is well designed and not that bothersome to have an exposed glass shower in the middle of the room.
The room itself smelled amazing. I'm usually an anti-scent person and have allergies to most fragrances, but this room smelled great. The roofdeck bar is nice and relaxing.
Sauc - the michelin starred restaurant in the hotel is great. An odd ambiance kinda tucked away into a corner, but amazing and imaginative food.
After a fantastic meal at the restaurant (or before, or both) make sure to check out the bar. I'm a fan of craft cocktails, and the bartenders here are clearly some of the best in the world. It's one thing to come up with imaginative and innovative drinks with unique presentations. It's quite another thing to do this and come up with drinks that are well-balanced and taste great. Needless to stay we stopped by each night for both pre dinner drinks and nightcaps.",5,2013,10,02
23,Fantastic start to my honeymoon,My husband and I stayed at the Ohla hotel for the first night of our honeymoon and I couldn't have asked for a better place to start our trip.  The staff was wonderful and the location was very convenient.  We got a lovely junior suite (be prepared for a transparent shower stall).  The breakfast was pretty good though not mind-blowing.  I'd definitely stay here again.,5,2013,09,29
23,"Outstanding location, great restaurants","Location in the old city couldn't be better - convenient to major sights, best neighborhoods, restaurants, and the metro for more distant destinations. Hotel breakfast was great (don't miss the pancake when you're offered a cooked item), as was an arrival lunch, and for a special treat, one night's break from the street in the hotel restaurant was spectacular, albeit not necessarily Catalan. Rooms are modest in dimensions but quite comfortable, slickly designed, with some touches that in time may see tweaking: lighting over the vanity is better suited for spotlighting jewelry than for shaving or applying makeup and the theatrical glass shower in the living space, while perhaps a boost to anemic marriages, is definitely not for everyone.",4,2013,09,28
23,Great hotel with incredible cocktails!,"The front of house are attentive and friendly. The hotel is nicely designed with some lovely touches and a very comfortable bed.  
Location is in walking distance of most of the central places you'd want to visit. It is near the metro line so you will get the odd rumbling vibration.
Roof top bar has one of the best views in Barcelona although you will only want to use the pool if you're comfortable being exposed to all by the glass siding.

The cocktail bar is a real highlight. It has some of the most expertly mixed, creative cocktails I've ever had the pleasure of drinking! Try the 5 Drop Ritual for craft or the Gentlemans Secret for fun :)",5,2013,09,27
23,Very nice boutique hotel on a great location,"We stayed there for two nights and loved it. The restaurant is very good, the tapas bar also.
The front desk and consierge was always there to help. Nice roof top view!!!! We enjoy every aspect of the hotel starting with the location, which is the Gotic area, close to many restaurants, bars, museums, and shops.",5,2013,09,24
23,Loved it,"We recently stayed at the Ohla Hotel.  WOW - what can we say except for excellent - ideally located for sightseeing in Barcelona.  The reception staff and concierge were first class - extremely helpful and professional.   The room was spotlessly clean - the bed comfortable and the linens a real treat. 

If we had to make any criticism at all it would be that the rooftop terrace could have had a few more comfortale chairs and was a bit pricey, the completely see-through shower - a little more privacy would have been nice and the waiters in the breakfast restaurant a little more friendly.

Would definitely recommend this hotel and would consider it again for any future stays in Barcelona.",5,2013,09,24
23,Nice located hotel,"Very nice scenery on the rooftop. Hotel very well located for visiting the nice places of Barcelona & shopping. Would rate it more a 4,5 start than 5star hotel.
Rooms are well equiped (we had a junior suite) but have done Mandarin hotel & W hotel and that were really 5star hotels
Just one advice : be on time for breakfast because there's little space to eat.... First in are the lucky ones",4,2013,09,22
23,Abdelhalim Siddig,"best for city center every thing is around you even the Air port Bus

 The rooftop terrace with pool is lovely but the real wow factor of this hotel is the Cocktail Masterclass",4,2013,09,22
23,OK but not exactly 5 star,"I stayed 2 nights and the services from this hotel were warm , not exaggerated but courteous.
Breakfast was was so wonderful, and the manager was so nice and kind, dishes were clean and delicious
lunch in restaurant was also good( Michelin star restaurant, I can't remember the name) 
room is somewhat tiny and small
there was no bathtub in my room and I was  embarrased because there was no door to toilet
Not approprate for business trip, adequat with honeymoon or for couples ^^

But the location of this hotel is perfect! very quiet but central location, not far from Catalunya platz or Ramblas street. very close to lovely Catalunya music hall or Cathedral, Gothic Quarter.
Great for sightseeing!",4,2013,09,22
23,Most enjoyable,"Staff is higly professional. Efficient & friendly service. Good light in room - suitable for reading. Very good facilities for late departure after check-out. Not everyone likes a transparent shower in the middle of the room. 
Excellent location, Free wifi. Restaurant not recommended for vegetarians, but there are good places to eat outside.
      ",5,2013,09,22
23,Expected more from a five star hotel,"To whom this may concern:

Overall impression of The Ohla Hotel experience was just ok. I expected more from a five star hotel.

I’m glad that you asked for my feedback, if I may, I like to share with your company a very embarrassing situation I encountered the day of our arrival and my overall experience at the Ohla Hotel, Barcelona.       

Though we were at The Ohla Hotel for only one evening, we found the room to be pleasant and staff was friendly. When we arrived at the hotel, our rooms weren’t ready yet and were courteously asked to wait by the pool area, under the rain I might add until the rooms were ready; no one bothered to enquire about our welfare whatsoever during our long wait. 

The elevators are a bit confusing, if I may suggest, instead of 0 and 0.5 levels and such, it would make much more sense if the lower level s were titled A, B and C and the room levels 1, 2, 3, 4 and pool level be pool. Lower call button is to go down and upper call button is to go up; these are universal functions.  

Prior to our departure from the US to Amsterdam, I contacted Ohla Hotel and arranged transfer thru your concierge from the ship terminal to The Ohla Hotel. On September 15, 2013 the day of our arrival at Barcelona ship terminal, we waited well over one hour for the transfer I had personally arranged thru the concierge at Ohla Hotel.

I instead on telling my traveling companions that the vehicle I had arranged thru the hotel would arrive in just a matter of minutes, but in never arrived; I was extremely embarrassed and had no other alternative, but to stand in line for a taxi to take us to Ohla Hotel.

Upon our arrival at The Ohla Hotel, every staff member was pleasant; I explained the situation to the young lady at the desk who assisted us; she said she’d look into the matter, I never heard back from her at all, not even a sorry was offered by anyone.
 
Situations such as what I’ve described here left me with an unpleasant feeling towards my experience with the hotel’s customer service and a not so good overall impression of The Ohla Hotel. I hope you can understand why I said at the start that my overall experience was just ok, I had anticipated and expected much more from a five star hotel...         

Respectfully,
George LaBarga",3,2013,09,21
23,Cocktail Masterclass is a must!,"This hotel is a great little oasis in the heart of Barcelona. The staff are amazing, so helpful and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. The rooftop terrace with pool is lovely but the real wow factor of this hotel is the Cocktail Masterclass hosted by Giuseppe Santamaria - what an experience! Giuseppe treated us to 90 minutes of pure genius, amazing us with his expertise in mixology and exciting the senses. His cocktails were superb. One even included a smoking gramophone! What a perfect way to start an evening! Lovely hotel, would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,09,21
23,Trendy hotel in central location,"Wow, best check in ever, comfortable seat, pleasant, friendly receptionist and offered cava to savour at the same time.  As there's only 2 seats, and 1 receptionist, not sure how this system works when it gets busy !  
All staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful, most of the time.
Trendy room with a super shower in the middle of room !   Comfy bed and pillows (expected in 5 star hotel). It was very quiet, especially considering you're in the centre of Barca. It's a great location, close to everything.
Loved the rooftop bar, pool area - great views",5,2013,09,18
23,Haven in the city,"The Ohla hotel is located in the centre of the Gothic area close to the Cathedral, lots of bars and restaurants and within 10 minutes of the harbour and the Ramblas.

The room is modern,clean and comfortable. 

The restuarant serves a great selection of Tapas and has a great wine list. The inclusive breakfast is a real treat with so much choice for all tastes and even complimentary champagne to get your day off to a sparkling start.

The roof terrace with private chill areas and a small infinity pool and bar is the ideal place to relax after a full day of sightseeing.

The staff are friendly, helpful, knowledgable and very enthusiastic and give the hotel a 5 star feel.

My only dissapointment was the cocktail bar that was too small and didn't have the same feel as the rest of the hotel.

Highly recommended",4,2013,09,16
23,Ohla.....well worth the cost.,"This is a wonderful hotel........with excellent services in all areas. Spent three nights here.

Staff is attentive to details, very helpful in problem solving, great recommendations!!

Location is great...Via Laietana is easy to get to,  let alone getting around Barcelona.

Two Thumbs Up !!!",5,2013,09,16
23,Oohla Hotel,"Ideal location, friendly staff yet our junior suite was disappointing. room was not as clean as it should have been (especially the shower and wc)
Breakfast buffet was average, yet personnel very friendly and accomodating.
Disappointing for a 5 * Boutique hotel",3,2013,09,16
23,WOW .... simply perfect,"Fall in Love package in junior suite was the perfect start to our wedding anniversary. Location was ideal in this stunning city, breakfast had a wonderful selection, room was spacious with the open plan bathroom. Staff especially the Conceige were so helpful and offered price reductions and booking ahead for the must-see and do bus tour especially to the awesome Sagrada Familia. ",5,2013,09,15
23,"Great hotel, excellent service","I recently stayed at the Ohla Hotel for the last two nights of my honeymoon in Europe. I had a wonderful experience. The location is perfect, right in the center of the Gothic Quarter and an easy walk to the beach. The service was fantastic. We got to the hotel very early in the morning and they couldn't have been more accommodating - storing our luggage without us even having to ask, giving us a call as soon as our room was ready and sending us a complimentary bottle of Cava because we mentioned it was our Honeymoon. The decor was gorgeous, the breakfast was delicious, we adored the roof deck pool. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2013,09,13
23,Exceptional!,"From check in until check out it was flawless professional hospitality for the savviest of Travlers.  I stayed in the  Dome Suite which was the perfect city apartment.  Optima
 Location, caring friendly  staff and lovely rooms. All in all the perfect city hotel!",5,2013,09,11
23,Worth a the extra dollars,"Ohla Hotel is in a great location, and the service, condition of the room, breakfast - everything in fact, was top notch.  T/he only minor issue I had was that the bed was a little hard, but other than that, I would recommend this hotel without reservation - and if I come back to Barcelona, will stay here again in a hearbeat.",5,2013,09,10
23,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location","Just returned from six nights at the Ohla Hotel at the end of August/beginning of September 2013. As many here have said, the location is ideal for day tripping to the surrounding areas. The service was excellent and the staff very helpful. I'd agree that the lighting could be better and hopefully they'll improve it - I mentioned the lighting in the outgoing survey (something you don't always see either). Many have mentioned the showers, our first room did have the shower in the middle of the room with visibility throughout the room. However, the air conditioner went out and they moved us to another room. The second room had the wall/mirror facing the bedding area so it provided more privacy. So there are, evidently, varying scenarios. Didn't matter to my wife and I either way. Now, someone mentioned English speaking channels - for the times you are in the room (late nights, etc). All you need to do is use the tools option on the remote to make adjustments for language - easy. There were also channels like CNN, BBC, etc. so I don't agree with that/those complaints. We also enjoyed the food and service at breakfast and at the Tapas Bar. For the complaints about waiting for someone to assist with the hot orders at breakfast...all you need to do is ask for assistance, don't just sit there and wait! We needed some down time on our second day after arriving from San Diego and the pool area was great. It's small but we were able to get one of the cabanas and really enjoyed the morning. Didn't get up there at night - too much else going on outside the hotel for us. All in all, we REALLY enjoyed our stay and will plan to use the hotel whenever we return to Barcelona.",5,2013,09,08
23,Lovely rooftop patio!,"Great location and contemporary decor. Nice staff and breakfast, too. The tapas menu also looked yummy. You can't go wrong with this hotel so enjoy! The drinks, live music, (small) pool and view from the roof patio was the best!",5,2013,09,08
23,Gem of a hotel,"An excellent modern hotel in a fantastic location for walking around the city, especially the Gothic Quarter.  It's on a busy street but the rooms are sound proofed so you'll hardly notice.  Friendly staff, good breakfast, relaxing rooftop bar. Rooms are boutique style.  If you want to shower in private forget it.  The see-through shower's in the middle of the room.  Different!  Beds very comfy and they e-mailed before stay asking what kinda pillows, sheets etc we'd like!  Attentive!  Room wasn't ready until 3pm but that's pretty much the norm in Barca.  Why would anyone want to leave that fantastic city?",5,2013,09,06
23,Loved it!,"We couldnt've asked for anything more than this! Ideal location, easy access to the pedestrian shopping area and La Ramblas. The staff always keen to assist and very polite! The rooms, are well designed and with attention to detail, are very 'sexy' and 'seductive'. But the roof garden is an experience by itself! Definetely worth spending some time up there enjoying the views and taking photos. But the best bit is the cocktails at the bar! A must- visit even if not a hotel guest. Would definetely go back during my next visit to Barcelona!",5,2013,09,06
23,Great place..great location,"We stayed at the Ohla hotel for 3 nights and were very impressed.  Sleek, modern hotel, with a great staff.  Every staff person was very helpful.  They also included a great free breakfast every morning.  Highly recommend!",5,2013,09,04
23,Excellent hotel!,"This is a perfect hotel to stay in Barcelona! It is very well located, the staff is very gentle all the time, the rooms are perfect. The boutique style of the hotel makes it very cozy and special in all details. Besides that the restaurants and the roof terrace are something special. Highly recommended.",5,2013,09,03
23,nice hotel,"Nice hotel, great staff. Perfect location.

Breakfast very good. 
Rooms very nice and clean.

The only negative thing I can find is if you want a cab/taxi they don't call one, but just stopped a regular cab in the street so you don't know if you can trust the cabdriver.",4,2013,09,02
23,Great hotel,"We are from Sweden and have stayed with my family at two occasions and this is our experience of Ohla Hotel:

Location: Fantastic location in central Barcelona and very close to communications like tourist bus stops, airport bus stops, metro and local buses and the harbor within walking distance.

Food: Gastro Bar is very good and their tapas is a must to try as a dinner option. Not pricey at all for the quality you get. We paid approx 10 EUR per day for breakfast which definitely is worth it at that price. We did not dare to try Sauc restaurant while having a 2-year old on the trips and the restaurant opens at 8.30pm and a tired son would possibly disturb other guests.

Rooms: Rooms located on the lower floors and towards Via Laietana will clearly hear road noise and the Metro. Floor 5 is less disturbed but still not as quiet as you might expect if you are sensitive for noise. The Junior suite is very nice and includes a bath tube. The Design deluxe rooms has the shower in the middle of the room and only glass walls which means that you need to be comfortable to shower in front of your partner. The beds are as most hotel beds very hard to sleep on but the linen is of very good quality. Air-condition is working well and sparkling water is free for the guests. Cleanliness is very good. Baby crib with std measurements 60*120cm is perfect for infants/smaller children.

Service: The service is very good from reception to concierge and restaurant and cleaning staff. Everyone is really trying to give you a pleasant stay and will help out if you have any questions at all.

Roof: The pool and bar is very nice and much appreciated regardless if you're a two-year old or if you're 30 and there to party in the afternoon :) The view is fantastic.",4,2013,09,02
23,Great Boutique Hotel!!!,"Just stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. All I can say is I will stay here again once I'm back to Barcelona. Great location, comfy rooms, great food, and the have a small but practical pool where you can refresh after a hot summer day. I will recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.",5,2013,09,01
23,Not worth the 5 stars,"In terms of service and style/atmosphere not worth the 5 stars and the price segment! It's a matter of details but that's exactly what makes the difference between a top end hotel and an average hotel and though justifies the higher price. For instance, average luggage service, average restaurant service, no-one replying at the reception when calling from the room and other small points without much importance by themselves but adding up at the end.",2,2013,08,28
23,Expensive hotel that did not quite meet expectations.,"After reading all of the fab reviews for this hotel on TA I had high expectations for this hotel, disapointingly it did not quite live up to them. The positives are that the hotel is in a great location, the modern and original decoration is fascinating and the staff are very helpful and friendly. However, for a five star hotel there were some things that did not hit the mark. We had a long wait to check in, there is no English language tv channels (with the exception of news), there was no coffee available in the room, the pool is tiny, and the roof top bar has very little seating space. On top of this, and those with kids may think this is a plus, but I like to enjoy my cocktails in peace, there were children running around in the downstairs bar. I know none of these things are huge, but when you are paying Ohla Hotel prices I would have hoped for a little more.",3,2013,08,28
23,Great Hotel,"We have just come back from a great weekend in Barcelona and stayed at the wonderful hotel Ohla.  It's a great location in the coolest part of town on the edge of the Born District, we had a junior suite which was amazing. The roof top pool is fantastic and great for an afternoon chill before heading out for the evening.
We will be back.",5,2013,08,27
23,Fantastic Barcelona mini break at Ohla Hotel,Beautiful boutique hotel. Fabulous modern rooms with a great central shower and really comfy beds. Great service. Amazing cocktails at the rooftop bar. This hotel is in a fabulous location and we walked to everything. Concierge gave us some good restaurant recommendations too!                              ,5,2013,08,24
23,Ending a great vacation,We spent one night at the Ohla after returning from a cruise.  Ohal has a wonderful style about it with nicely appointed spacious room.  There rooftop bar and pool has a wonderful setting viewing the beautiful roof tops of Barcelona.  The staff is extremely attentive to detail and very professional.,5,2013,08,23
23,A pleasant hotel,"The Ohla hotel is nicely located to the Gothic and Rambla area.  It is set away from the busier areas but is still fairly busy.  It is near the bus routes and there are some lovely little shops surrounding the area.  Some of the staff are lovely and friendly while others are quite abrupt and unfriendly.  The breakfast is basic but nice.  There is a good selection.  The rooftop pool is nice but quite small.  It has nice views of the city.  The rooms are clean but quite dark as the decor is black and white.  The shower is strange, an all glass shower in the middle of the room.  Fine if your with a partner as they can see you while you shower.  I would come again as the location is good.",4,2013,08,22
23,I loved this place!,"I'm French but, as usual, I'll write in English so that the most of you can understand me.
We booked for three nights in this hotel in august through the hotel website for an executive room.

First, I really want to congratulate the staff: an extremely efficient conciergerie (with good advice: ask them before going anywhere!) and warm welcome at the reception (with refreshments and so on, in the language you want). It continues at your room: every evening your room is lit up with a small chocolate on it and a note from reception. Cleaning ladies are efficient and discreet and don't bother you, same for room service. All of them with a smile and even a surprised expression on their face when you give them a tip for the luggage or the car.

The decoration, then: of course, if you don't like modern, design decoration: avoid! Otherwise, if you're a great fan (like me), go there: you'll find plenty of ideas! Our room was the 410. It was quite big and all in the grey colours. On the left of the entrance, there was a big wardrobe with a mini bar (wide range and choice of snacks and drinks) and on the right, the bathroom. The completely glass-walled big shower is in the middle of the room (from there, you can perfectly follow your favourite program on TV). Toilets are separated (door astuciously hidden, no handle). One side of the shower has a big mirror to see yourself in front of the wardrobe (useful). The bed is quite big with good quality linen and a great (perfect, for my taste) mattress (double mattress overlays - if someone can give me the brand, I'll buy the same for my home). Each side, you've got funny little pebbles hanging which lit at night (variable light - once again, I want the same ones). And the air-conditionning system is the best I tested so far: no noise, no air directly on your face when you're in bed, precise thermostat and invisible device! The view on carrer comtal is not fantastic but I prefer that than via laetania (too noisy, probably). The two little details I disliked were: there isn't enough light near the sink / tub, the big window can't be opened and the balcony (even if the window could be opened) is quite small. I suppose that, in winter, if the weather is not good, I would soon get bored in this room. But, here, it was not the case: I spent my day visiting and loved to find my room back my day trips.
The rest of the hotel is the same: the façade is just fascinating, the spiral staircase is beautiful, the glass footbridge, the lights above the lobby bar...everything is a good discovery.
Maybe the corridors are a little too dark, yet (and freezing cold with the air-conditionning!).
The pool area offers a stunning view on Barcelona. The swimming-pool itself is quite small but very funny: a part of it is made of glass, such as, if you are on the other side of the terrasse, you can see people as if they were in a water tank! There are sunbeds there but, careful: it's not very big so you might not find any spare one. At 7 o'clock pm, the terrasse and the bar opens for other clients (who do not stay at the hotel, I mean). Which means: no swimming after that hour and sunbeds retrieved at 6:30...I don't think it's a good idea because people like me visit during the day and expect to relax at this hour! By the bye, it is the only place which I did not find perfectly clean (cigaret buts, dirty side tables) even if I loved their cocktails.

The location is another great advantage of this hotel: you are two minutes walk away from La rambla and the raval area (plenty of restaurants) and very near passeig de gracia (shopping). You've got a tube stop in front of the hotel and different places of interest nearby (opera, gothic cathedral, modern art museum...etc). A bank is also opposite the street.

And you can sleep there! No noise! Ah! You can have breakfast up to 11 o'clock, which I liked too. Probably the breakfast is the only bad point for me: not varied enough (for 3 nights it's ok, but for a week, you might get bored!), not like the ones I could find in other five-star hotels...

To finish, there is also a small car park within the hotel (uhm, for 12 cars, I think. so don't forget to book!). You pay for it (30 euros per day). Some would say it is expensive but they have to consider that many hotels in Barcelona don't have a car park and that you have to park it in a public car park then (at 35 euros per day).

I will go there again, at least to taste the restaurant as, stupid me, I tried others in the area, not knowing it was a good one! (and the gym, and the spa)",5,2013,08,19
23,"Expensive, so expectations were high","Picked this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor and its location. As it is in the Gothic Quarter, you are a 7 minute walk to Las Ramblas. The hotel is modern and very trendy, but expensive for what you get. The shower in the middle of the room is really different and you must ensure you are comfortable with your travelling companion. The staff were excellent, really down to earth; no sign of pretence. Would return if on special in the future.",4,2013,08,19
23,Amazing!!!!,"When I return to Barcelona I will stay at this hotel again, it was in perfect location, service was so great I cannot even explain and overall I LOVED this hotel.  

ROOMS - were very modern, glass shower, very comfortable bed, and black out curtains for those late nights.  

AREA- I could not have asked for a better area to be in, I walked everywhere and hardly needed a cab.

POOL – I DIE!!!!  Glass facing pool with hip crowd at night – a total MUST!!!  Have some Cava (a bottle) around 11pm then head out to start your night.",5,2013,08,16
23,Amazing hotel in great location,"Beautiful hotel with stunning, comfortable bedrooms.  The upstairs pool deck area is fantastic at night and restaurant offers the best tapas I have ever eaten!  Compliments to the chefs!
My only complaint would be that pool is too small and that no privacy in shower if sharing room with a friend but overall still worth the trip and would definitely go back.  Staff were also friendly and extremely helpful.  All in all - a weekend to remember!",5,2013,08,15
23,Brilliant weekend,12 of us stayed at the Ohla hotel for the weekend. From the check-in to the check out they were fantastic. Absolutely brilliant location and loved the infinity pool. Great rooftop bar and restaurants. Cant wait to go again!,5,2013,08,14
23,Beautiful hotel in the center of Barcelona,The really five stars hotel in the center of Barcelona!!!! Perfect location!!! Comfortable rooms! Breakfast was great! The pool was with views of cathedral! Hotel is very clean and lovely. The staff was knowledgable and very patient!,5,2013,08,14
23,Beautiful boutique hotel - weird shower arrangement,"The location of the hotel is perfect, the design beautiful....the toilet/shower arrangements are weird tough. The breakfast was so so and we had to wait for a table as they only had a couple a tables available for breakfast. Overall I had a good impression of the hotel, a bit unpersonal maybe.",4,2013,08,14
23,fantastic hotel,"this place was outstanding - my wife and I enjoyed every minute of our stay.

The location was fantastic, not too touristy, with easy walking access to the gothic quarter and metro stops.

The rooftop pool was a dream, with views of the Mediterranean a delicious bar and a beautiful pool

The concierge was fantastic, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Perhaps the best concierge I have interacted with. I would point to a spot on the map and they could immediatley surrounding restaurants on memory alone.

The rooms are spacious, modern and clean.

The bar downstairs was terrific with world class drinks

A great hotel for couples.",5,2013,08,12
23,Barcelona At Its best,How Anyone Could Rate This Place Less Than 5 Stars Is Not Comprehensible.  Perfect In Every Aspect...The Way To Run A Hotel!  Staff Is Extremely Knowledgable And Courteous...Rooms Are Clean And Comfortable And Location Is great,5,2013,08,11
23,The best in Barcelona,"From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. 
I've never experienced a hotel quite like it - our room wasn't ready upon check in but that was understandable as we arrived at 1030am but we were keen to get out and explore the City. The receptionist (Laura I think her name was) showed us to the gym and spa where she said we could shower and freshen up before heading out. She then took our bags and stored them for us whilst we were out. We came back after some lunch and for me to change my shoes and the room was ready. 
The room was beautiful - we had a junior suite on the first floor over looking the square outside - the rooms are clean and spacious, wonderful minimalistic decor with a fabulous bathtub! 
That afternoon we went upstairs to the rooftop pool. The views are incredible overlooking the cathedral and far into the mountains. The pool is small but it's actually warm and you get a good amount of sun on the loungers and also in the cabanas. 

That evening the concierge booked us a table in a restaurant (Comerc 24) and got us a taxi arranged. We had a free cocktail voucher for the bar so we redeemed that and wow... The cocktails were incredible. The bartenders are amazing and fascinating to watch!

Breakfast is good - a tad limited but still really good food. 

The hotel's location itself is brilliant. Right across the road from the Metro and one stop to Barceloneta and Port Olimpica. 
And one stop in the other direction to Passieg de Gracia. 
It's easy to access other points of interest too.
Starbucks just around the corner and walking distance to the Cathedrel and a supermarket across the road to name a few points!! 

It's an amazing hotel and I certainly would return! We have already been trying to plan another visit around our work schedules!! ",5,2013,08,11
23,Eddie50,"This hotel ticks all the boxes. Great location, professional, friendly and helpful staff. Close to all amenities, metro a few minutes away, shopping is close by, but because of its location, it does retain a bit of privacy, away from the crowds. 
We chose a junior suite, which is quite spacious, with separate toilet, shower and a bath which is situated in the open area.
We did not use many of the hotels facilities( after all we were on holiday in Barcelona), except the buffet breakfast which again was substantial.
Would highly recommend if you are looking for a bit more than somewhere to rest your head.",5,2013,08,09
23,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location,"We stayed for three days in May. Beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff. We had a corner junior suite , which was awesome. Lots of light, roomy with a great shower. The location was perfect, within walking distance to much of the wonderful city of Barcelona.  Thanks Ohla hotel for an awesome couple of days in Barcelona!!",5,2013,08,08
23,Wonderful,"Wanting a totally relaxing few days away I booked the Ohla hotel in Barcelona by checking out some tripadvisor reviews. It was quite simply perfect. The moment I arrived I was treated like VIP. Complimentary Cava was served whilst I checked in and nothing seemed to be too much trouble.

The hotel is in the heart of the city's Gothic quarter, great for bars, restaurants and shopping.

The room was chic with a really stunning minimalist vibe. The bathroom beautifully designed and black in decor. 

The restaurants were fabulous and the bar, quite simply divine. They serve one of the best dry Martini's that I've ever had. The way in which it's served is pure theatre. I won't spoil the surprise so you must try one.   

The roof top pool (great views of Barcelona) and chill out areas are exceptional and the music is just right.

Finally the staff....Well they really did make my stay very special indeed.

The down side? The reviews for this hotel are, quite rightly, good and so trying to book again for a few days in September is proving to be impossible.",5,2013,08,08
23,Excellent,"Brilliant hotel, attentive service, fabulous roof pool and terrace and great location. Would be good if there were a couple of English tv channels that aren't news or music to veg in front of for 30 mins after a hard days sight seeing but other than this (incredibly) minor issue the hotel is superb. ",5,2013,08,05
23,Elegant,"The hotel is beautiful. The location is perfect, within walking distance to anything you may want to see or a way to get to one. The breakfast was amazing and included champagne! The pool on the roof is small but beautiful and has great views of the city. The staff are friendly and helpful. The luggage storage was easy to use and safe so we could check in the luggage, go explore the city and then come back when it was time to check in. We used it checking in and out. Fabulous!",5,2013,08,02
23,Excellent hotel and best service ever,"Excellent modern hotel in good part of the city just behind the Cathedral and all the shopping streets only 200 m walk. Metro and busstops just other side of the street.  Chilling area with pool on the roof was even better expected. The pool is like 'aqvarium' - nice specially when you have kids together.
The breakfast was fresh and buffet-table  gave you a good start for every day.
All the restaurants in hotel were suberb and the service excellent. 
Highly recommend to everybody!!=)",5,2013,08,01
23,"Nice stay, excellent restaurant","Very nice hotel located centrally to see all the fun spots in the old part of town.  Very clean modern rooms.  You do get a bit of street noise at night and the rumble of the train until about midnight, but it is not bad.  Sauc the restaurant was incredible.  Didn't really expect it so it was even a nicer surprise and the service at dinner was impeccable.",4,2013,07,31
23,Great hotel,"A modern and nice hotel. The rooms were small but very stylish and space-efficient. The bathroom solution was cool with the shower placed in the middle of the room. 

The view from the roof was amazing, but the pool was really small.
Great location, great service!",5,2013,07,31
23,Excellent hotel!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the end of July for my boyfriends birthday. 
There was a complimentary bottle of cava in our room after our first afternoon on the roof terrace, which was a lovely touch. 

We stayed in a Design room which was great, loads of space and light with floor to ceiling windows. 
The location is superb, you're in walking distance of the beach, gothic cathedral and the tour buses! 

The only 2 negatives I really have (not that they're really negative at all) -
1. The roof terrace was a bit small, we've stayed in other hotels with much larger roof terraces and when it gets busy it's very crowded with people lying on the floor etc! And the design of the pool, means the water can over flow under the sun loungers so any bags or stuff on the floor gets absolutely soaked. 
However you can't really argue with it when it has those views!!!!!
2. The cleaners - one day they completely forgot to clean/make our bed and another day they came whilst I was having a nap and were a bit funny about coming back later. They also missed us for turndown service one day, and then tried to come again at 7pm when we were getting ready (a bit early I thought!) and when I asked them to come back they were funny again about it. 

But apart from that, I would definitely stay at the hotel again! It was one of the best I've stayed in. And drinks on the roof terrace at night after our dinner out was one of the highlights!!! ",5,2013,07,31
23,Simple excellence,"I have stayed in Barcelona many times over the last 20 years, both on business and for pleasure and this was the best trip and stay so far. We stayed in the Dome Suite and this was an excellent room that had every possible amenity and convenience. The roof terrace was excellent and fun and the location of the hotel was perfect.

The best thing of all though was the service. Nothing was too much trouble and whilst the service was attentive it was not overpowering. Every request we made was met and they even provided a complimentary bottle of champagne on the evening of our anniversary. The thing that made this stay stand ou",5,2013,07,30
23,The Right Place In Barcelona,"Ohla Hotel combines the old with the new by creating a boutique hotel in the shell of an older building. The location is perfect, just a block from the Palau de la Música, one of the most beautiful buildings in Barcelona and only a few more blocks to the Eixample district and its Modernista  buildings such as Casa Amatller  and Casa Batlló. In the other direction is the Barrio Gotic with its labyrinth of streets, many opening into squares.  The staff is international with Italian bartenders and French concierges.  It has a Michelin starred restaurant called SAUC, which we didn’t try and a gastro bar which offers tapas and much more with its friendly staff and great food. The Ohla Boutique Bar boasts a modern eclectic décor with an award winning bartender and looks out onto the bustling street scene of Via Laietana. The rooms are moderate sized with the novelty of a glass enclosed shower in the center of the room. A roof top pool and bar offer views of the city. In short a great hotel with an even better staff.",5,2013,07,29
23,Exclusiv hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in July 2013. Fantastic service. Nice and clean room, it smelled even good. Very good beds. What I liked the most, was the fantastic terrasse at the roof, with a small pool and sunbeds, and with view to Gaudi's La Sagrada the Familia. 

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but we tried the Tapas-bar once. The food was good, but not fantastic. 

Spa (body massage 1 hour) was OK.

The only bad thing about this hotel, is the prices of the drinks - at least three times more expensive than outside the hotel. But that is what you get at at expensive hotel.",5,2013,07,29
23,The service wasn't up to it.,"I stayed in this hotel with my partner and two friends. I didn’t choose the hotel myself as one of my friends was talking care of that. When we arrived at the hotel, there was no reception desk at the entrance. Instead we were taken to the 0.5 floor where there was a small desk. We were offered wine, which was a nice touch but the whole check in procedure took longer than I think it should have. It wasn’t helped by the receptionist stopping to answer the phone and talk to a cleaner during the process. We had to complete some paperwork, but there wasn’t really space around the desk. It was a little cramped with the four of us and our luggage. I was very pleased to escape the reception in the end and make it to our room.

The room itself was very nice. Modern and beautifully designed. There wasn’t any view to speak of, but that was acceptable to me. The only possible complaint I might have had was that the shower cabinet was in the middle of the bedroom and therefore offered no privacy. This wasn’t a problem for us, but it strikes me as a strange thing to. I suppose it depends who you are travelling with. I tend to be a it old fashioned in this respect and think that things should be in different rooms with opaque walls between them. I realise this makes me somewhat of a dinosaur in the world of five star hotels. 

The location of the hotel was fantastic. It was right in the middle of the city and within walking distance of several of the major attractions.

We visited the cocktail bar several times. The bar was excellent, and the people working there were clearly very talented. This was probably some of the best service we got on our entire trip. The prices were probably high by Spanish standards, but coming from Norway this wasn’t an issue for us. The Tapas restaurant in the hotel was very nice, with some delicious food. I felt the vegetarian selection could have been better though.

The breakfast caused some problems, one of them being the lack of vegetarian options. The main problem was that the breakfast room was really too small to fit everyone in. The buffet was served on the bar, which caused problems with people bumping into one another. The tables were also quite close together. This was ok, but more space would have been nice. The biggest problem was when we went to breakfast on our day of departure. The room was full and we were eventually sent upstairs to the restaurant where there was no food. This was annoying since we were told that the reason we had to wait to go up to the restaurant was because they were moving a selection of food up to the restaurant for us to choose form. We then had to try to explain to the waiter what we wanted from the buffet and wait while he fetched it. This did not work out well. The whole thing took too long and was not pleasant. We assumed that other people would be sent up to the restaurant but it was only us and a couple of other people. 

I would say that the level of service let the hotel down. I would not have awarded it 5 starts with that level of service. That left me a little disappointed and I think I would look for somewhere else to stay if I was returning to Barcelona.",4,2013,07,25
23,A wonderful location and a flawless stay,"Our experience of the Ohla hotel was excellent. We stayed for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon. We were greeted with a glass of cava and made to feel very welcome. The bed was extremely comfortable and the location was perfect for experiencing some of the sights and thrills of Barcelona.

We'll definitely be returning.",5,2013,07,24
23,Worth a repeat visit,"To set the stage, before our arrival, emails were received asking about pillow and scent preferences.  Our room was cleverly laid out, with a ""galley"" style bathroom that made the most of the space and was worth taking pictures of in case we ever need a spacious bath in a tight space.  The rooftop pool provides a terrific view after a hot day of outside activities.  The concierge staff is amazing, juggling lots of requests, yet still making you feel you are a priority.   Located on one of the main roads, its easy to get a cab to anywhere you can imagine - as well as being within 5 minutes of the Gothic Cathedral, Las Ramblas or the main thoroughfare to view the Modernists architecture.   The main floor's restaurant and bar were great, but don't miss the side street, which is filled with local eateries and food shops. Their were two small annoyances. 1. The registration is up on the mezzanine in a very tight area, so if more than two couples are checking in, there is very almost nowhere to wait. 2.  When we arrived before our room was ready, their was nowhere other than a small bathroom downstairs to change in.",4,2013,07,23
23,"Great Hotel, even better location","Hotel Reception:
We were welcomed, quickly checked-in, and guided to our room. I prefer a quick check-in process.

Room: Superior - 8th floor
Rooms are modern and simply decorated in an efficient layout. If you are staying with a friend or someone you are uncomfortable being nude around, you may want to check your room. The shower glass enclosed on 3 sides and open to the room. Great rain shower. I thought the room was just perfect, although I could see some finding it on the small side. Bed was super comfortable, and they offered many different pillow options. I also liked that we faced the side-street, as Barcelona is a pretty loud city traffic-wise, that also explains the permanently sealed windows. 

Pool/Rooftop:
Great looking pool, and really nice view from the rooftop. Service was excellent. Nice addition to a summertime visit. 

Maintenance/Cleaning:
Room was spotless as was the rest of the hotel. I was not displeased with the service, however the cleaning schedule seemed somewhat inconsistent, and there were some days where we returned to a room that was had not been cleaned. Overall the housekeeping service was excellent, they even called to confirm if we put a dnd for turn-down. 

Service: 
Overall I would say the service was excellent. The concierges did a great job recommending restaurants and places to visit, but even better did it very efficiently on the spot. I really appreciate knowledgeable and quick service from a concierge and Xavier was especially helpful. 

Breakfast:
Couldn't ask for much more, delicious self-serve and prepared dishes, and there is an expert shmoozer they've employed to check on every table every morning to make sure people are happy and satisfied. She does a great job making sure the guests are taken care of. 

Location:
It was my first time to Barcelona, but I've got a very strong sense of direction, and my wife and I being from NYC enjoy being able to walk to all different neighborhoods. Based on my assessment this hotel has an optimal location in the city. It's walk-able  in 5-10 mins to the hippest areas, la ribera/ el born, bario gotic. You can get to Barceloneta in 20, Eixample in 10 as well. Since it's on a main street, it's very easy to get a taxi or subway. I think a good portion of the value here is the location. 

Summary:
After reading many reviews, I was nervous about the service quality. I can say they are clearly taking note of these reviews as the service was one of the best parts of the hotel, which is key at this price level. I thought the room was great, and felt basically brand new, and the location is absolutely superior. Especially if you are 30s couple from an urban center looking to explore.",4,2013,07,23
23,Great Find in a Great Location,"Barcelona was one of the nicest cities we had personally every visited. Loved it and can't wait to go back for a much longer visit.  The Ohla hotel is located right in the center of things and close enough to walk to almost everything, restaurants, Las Rambles, etc.  It is also situated in a great location that makes it easy to take self walking tours of the city using an AAA books and a map.

The room we had was not overly large but sufficient. They provide a decent size bed, which was very comfortable. They have a pool on the roof that overlooks the city with a magnificent view. Their breakfast Buffet was good, not lavish, but very acceptable. 
Our room faced the main street which is pretty busy. However the window was pretty well insulated and street noise was not a big issue.

Only strange thing is that the glass enclosed shower sits almost in the middle of the room, which is one of the reasons I am told that they recommend only couples over a certain age stay there. Also, if you are with a partner and shy about being seen in “the buff” while you shower, the hotel may not be for you.",4,2013,07,22
23,Disappointing hotel,"The hotel looks nice, but has serious flaws. No windows can be opened at the rooms, and the cleaning people use HEAVY soaps on the floor, which means the smell of chemicals lingers in the room for five-six hours, no matter how mufh air condition you put on. The breakfast is limited, almost no vegetables. Mainly cheese and loaf. Disappointing.
The staff is friendly and helpful. The location is good, nearby Rambla and Born. Hiwever, The hotel is next to a heavily polluted main road in Barcelona.

All in all,not worth the price.",3,2013,07,22
23,Great base for Barca,"We stayed at the Ohla Hotel for three nights in a deluxe junior suite.
It is a wonderful base to discover Barcelona. Very central, close to La Ramblas, 10 minutes walk from the marina - and we walked to the beach a number of times.
It is surrounded by great bars and tapas restaurants.

The room was really lovely. Very spacious, with a view on to the street.
The roof pool is a joy. After wandering around the streets it was lovely to come back to the hotel, catch some sun, have a sunset cocktail and take a dip in the pool.

The concierge were excellent. Incredibly helpful - booking us tickets, giving us tips and recommendation for restaurants.

If and when we come back to Barcelona - I would definitely book at the Ohla.",5,2013,07,22
23,Luxury Boutique Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"What a great place to stay in the heart of the old part of Barcelona...Just metres away from the Ramblas, the main shopping hotspots, the designer boutiques on Passeig de Gracia...and a ten minutes walk from the harbour and the beach! What more could you wish for? Oh, of course, good food...Well, they have that too! Do try the Ohla Gastrobar for exquisite tapas...Simple preparations using the region's finest ingredients...Great, reasonably priced wines make the experience complete....Nice designer rooms, with good sound proof large windows (as the hotel is situated on a busy road...). Do travel to the eight floor to enjoy the great views over cocktails in the rooftop bar or take a jump into the nicely designed 'urban swimming pool'....Boutique size (74 rooms) with great staff...WE WILL BE BACK!",5,2013,07,22
23,Pure madness!,"Great hotel, great facilities!
Nice 'twist' in their interior design and a great rooftop terrace and swimmingpool.
The bartender is worldclass (try his version of old fashioned)!
Overall an amazing experience and a good spot to check out Barcelona.",5,2013,07,21
23,Hotel Ohla,"This 5* hotel has a traditional a traditional exterior, allbeit with added 'eyes on stalks' dotted around in an effort to make it look funky.  The modern makeover of the interior is dark and dreary.  The decor is essentially black and white, with the addition of old spanish doors decorating parts of the gastro bar downstairs which does not fit the rest of the image.  The food in the aforementioned bar is good in the evening, if not particularly cheap.  The continental breakfasts are also served there, with the option one one hot dish per day which can be requested.  The little home made cakes are a nice treat.  The superior room which we inhabited (like the others) have a see through shower plonked inconveniently in the middle of the ablutions area, no good for people who like their privacy.  The full length mirror on the side of the shower is poorly sited to gain a full length view of yourself.  The lighting is poor around the sink for putting on makeup (to whom this may apply).  The mattresses and bedding were of a good standard.  The air conditioning is slow to react to changes in settings, and you are not able to open the windows on safety grounds.  There is no coffee provided, only tea bags.  This can easily be remedied by visiting one of the two supermarkets directly opposite the hotel.  Indeed, we bought all our coffee, milk, alcohol, juices and snacks there as required, all quite cheaply.   The pool terrace is small but adequate.  The water in the pool is not heated, but stil refreshing to dip in to in summer (it is too small to do much actual swimming in).  Cocktails are expensive, up to 16 euro a (plastic) glass each.  I would class this hotel as 3* or 4* if it were in Britain.  The concierge and reception staff are very helpful, as is the nice young lady in charge of seating at breakfast.  The main positive is the hotel's central location, two streets away from La Ramblas, close to the gothic cathedral, and a short Metro ride down to the beaches.  The nearest Metro station is two minutes away from the hotel.  Things to do:  See some of Gaudi's architecture, swim in the sea, and take a trip to the Monserrat monestry complex in the mountains where the scenery is beautiful, and the associated art gallery contains original works by Monet, Picasso and Salvador Dali (all early works).  Tip:  buy a five day Metro ticket to save money if you want to look aroung the city.  These can be used on the underground railway and the local buses.",3,2013,07,18
23,Amazing!,Best hotel I've ever stayed in.  Service was superb.  Nothing too much effort.  Gorgeous roof top pool.  Fabulous food.  Cava at check in and check out.  Best massage I've ever had.  Overall an amazing experience to celebrate my 40th birthday.,5,2013,07,17
23,Amazing Stay!,"We loved this hotel and if we were going back to Barcelona we wouldn't hesitate to book here again! We were in Barcelona for 6 nights and had 4 nights here and 2 nights at the Pullman Skipper. The hotel is in a perfect location just a short walk away from the main square, the Ramblas, the Gothic and El Born areas. The design is lovely, the rooftop pool and bar is great and is especially nice to sit up there in the evening for drink. We stayed in a Deluxe room which was very spacious for us, the shower is in the centre of the room which is ok for couples but I imagine would be slightly awkward for friends staying together. On check in the very nice guy at the desk even noticed it was my boyfriends birthday on the Saturday and when we came back into our room after being out all day on the Saturday there was a lovely birthday note and bottle of Cava from the hotel. Very much appreciated and very kind. The breakfast selection is very good, cereals, fruit, bread, meats, cheese etc and you get the choice of one hot dish as well such as eggs, waffle or pancakes. The only thing that we were disappointed in was the staff serving at breakfast as they weren't very attentive and we had to find them to place an order with them but that was our only gripe during our stay",5,2013,07,12
23,Excellent for couples who want to treat themselves,"Brilliant service from the moment we walked through the door.  This was our honeymoon location and we were made to feel very special by all of the staff.  Special mention for the concierge team - excellent advice, nothing too much trouble, great local knowledge that helped us avoid queues and get the most from our time in Barcelona.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,07,10
23,Very nice hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for a night and enjoyed it. The room was big enough with a view to the high street - a bit noisy at times. The room has all equipment you need and has lovely shower and bath in the room which we really liked. The hotel has an amazing roof ( a small) with a view in the city and a swimming pool - great place to chill out.
The breakfast was a bit disappointing as I didn't find much there and the service was a bit slow bt my husband thought it was good.
The only think that I did not like is the recommendation of the event with a dinner from a concierge because the hotel has a Michelin star restaurant but we were recommended the place with awful 
food. Despite they were helpful, we wouldn't take their recommendation again if we stay in the same place.
The reception was very friendly but made us wait a bit on the check in.
The location of the hotel is perfect.

I would recommend this place .",4,2013,07,09
23,Great hotel (but get drinks some where else),"I've read some reviews that people didn't like to location.  Not sure what they are looking for in the city but the hotel is within walking distance to La Ramblas which is a great place to eat, shop and hang out. It's also a couple of blocks from the Barcelona Cathedral and the open markets.  I loved the location.  There were great restaurants within walking distance (Neyeras was very good and less than a 5 min walk) and we loved coming back to the pool after trekking around the city all day.  Breakfast was ok, nothing great, but I wasn't expecting a huge US type spread.  Rooms were small-ish by US standards but well appointed and had a fun feel to them. The rooms reminded me of a W hotel.  They aren't for everyone and if you have traditional tastes this may not be the hotel for you.
Staff was accommadating but was not helpful when it came to recommending restaurants.  They seemed to have a list of 3 stock restaurants and didn't like to deviate from that.  While a tad annoying we just did our own research and didn't go to the hotel staff for recommendations.  Drinks at the hotel/pool bar were ridiculously expensive for what they were (I live in Manhattan so that's what I'm gauging pricing on and understanding Barcelona is a metro city so there really are not discounts here).  We actually bought water, beer and wine across the street (7 eleven type store) for seriously 1/10 of the cost in the hotel.  I have no problem doing more expensive hotel and subsidizing other places.  There is a mini fridge to keep things cold and the staff didn't seem to hae an issue with us moving the mini bottles around to make room for our things.  We also ordered ice a few times without any issue.
All in all a great hotel: great locations, fantastic pool and fun room.  It's a little expensive but if you want budget Europe you won't get the location, pool or room ammenities.  Just need to make decision if you want to spend the money on the hotel or on other things.",5,2013,07,07
23,The Restaurant in this hotel was amazing,My friend had a tasty mojito before dinner that was infused with chocolate and I had some delicious wine. The tapas were creative and interesting. The wait staff was accommodating and friendly..  Great spot in a great location near our hotel.,5,2013,07,06
23,The location is ok,"I paid EUR 340 per night. A five star's price. They gave me a room on the first floor with no view at all. I couldn't sleep all night because the metro. Only between 12 pm to 5 am, when the metro stop running. I asked for another room and the recepcionist (Jose) told me that all rooms are the same, the same terrible noise. When I took shower, the whole room got wet, realy wet. There are not gym. Only one chair in the lobby (a beautiful chair by the way). ""Thanks god""  allways I travel with my own pillows...The breakfast was ok, even for me that don't speak russian..The location and decoration are the reason to be ""poor"" instead ""terrible"".",2,2013,07,02
23,Fantastic,"My wife and I are demanding when it comes to accommodation.

Spent 4 nights here on recent visit to Barcelona. This is a great hotel in a perfect location for exploring the city.

Updated modern rooms. Great breakfast included and very helpful and friendly staff. 
Roof top pool an added bonus for relaxing after a long day of walking.

Would definitely recommend  this hotel and would stay here again on next visit.",5,2013,07,02
23,Perfect mini-moon destination!,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 days after our wedding and I have to say it was fabulous!  The location just 5 mins walk from the gothic quarter, 5 mins from El Born and 5 mins walk from La Rambla.  

The room was a little small (we did go for one of their cheaper rooms) but perfectly appointed we got an email from the concierge asking us what type of bed sheets, pillow and what scent we wanted in the room 2 weeks before we arrived!  Also I advised them that is was our honeymoon and they had scattered rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart and had a ice bucket with a bottle Cava by the bed!

I have to say the staff were fantastic, couldn't do enough for you.  The breakfast was great, wide range of pastries, cereals, juices, fruit, cured meats, cheeses + you could order one hot item per person from a small menu (scrambled eggs and bacon, pancakes etc). 

We also eat in Sauc the Michelin star restaurant on site which was fabulous and reasonably priced for what we had (€200 for 2 inc tip).

Pool on the rooftop was a real haven away from it all and great for a cocktail in the evening with views across the city.

Loved it!",5,2013,07,02
23,Excellent!,"This hotel is fantastic; From arrival to departure - top notch!

- Very friendly, accomodating staff.
- Spacious modern suites with fashionable decór; really tastefully appointed.
- Very clean and tidy.
- Great food; however, over-priced.
- Really nice terrace with pool overlooking the city.
- Very special attention to detail; management definitely makes sure you get VIP treatment. Was greeted with a welcome memo, chocolates and a bottle of Cava!
- Very friendly and accomodating cleaning staff that makes you feel right at home with their punctual turn-down service in the evening.
- Hotel is situated in a very safe area of Barcelona with access to shops and restaurants within very short walking distances and access to taxis and the metro right outside the lobby.

Definitely a 5-star establishment...I would definitely come back and stay here for my next trip to Barcelona; I highly reccomend this hotel!",5,2013,07,01
23,If you return to the same hotel its gotta be good!,"This is a great five star hotel in a prime, location between the Barri Gothic and El Born we stayed here last year and liked it so much we came back. Great service, good staff, lovely breakfasts in a super restaurant. Lovely room, unusual shower location! Great beds with super soft linens and to cap it all a rooftop pool and bar which we could swim in enen in early June. One day we must go and see the sites!!! (just joking). Enjoy.",5,2013,07,01
23,"Great hotel, perfect location.","This is a very good hotel in a brilliant location for exploring the city.  We spent 4 nights at Ohla and enjoyed them all.  The rooms are clean, modern and very trendy - our shower was in the middle of the room!  The little rooftop terrace and pool are great for chilling out after the a busy day sight seeing.  The best cocktails ever are to be found downstairs in the cocktail bar.  The only critism we had was of their 'Michelin Starred' Sauc restaurant which we found disappointing and completely without any atmosphere - play some background music for goodness sake Guys!  Staff are very attentive and the pre-arrival service is superb.  Would definitely go back (to the hotel, not the restaurant!).",5,2013,06,29
23,"Very cool, great location","Had a long weekend away with my girlfriends.  This hotel was perfect for our particular requirements. The central location was ideal for sightseeing.  We very much enjoyed the roof top deck and pool late afternoon/early evening.  Fabulous views over the city.  Service a bit slow at the roof terrace, my only complaint.  Rooms fairly small, and some may be put off by glass shower cubicle in the room (rather than in a separate bathroom) but we all had our own rooms, so no issue for us.  Lovely breakfast.  Great restaurant recommendation from the concierge on  Saturday night followed by late cocktails in the hotel bar afterwards.",5,2013,06,29
23,"Great hotel, service, and location.",Clean hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. A call for an iron to the front desk is immediate and staff are at your room within minutes. Sexy pool and modern rooms. Only one complaint. The shower door is flush with bathroom floor and when showering the water would leak from shower into the rest of the bathroom floor which connects to the room. A towel will help soak it up but makes a mess and the floor is wet. Complimentary cava for our honeymoon. Great stay. Oh and sexy shower viewing for honeymooners!,5,2013,06,28
23,Pleasant and stylish,"Spent 3 nights and was very satisfied with all aspects of the hotel. The service is consistently professional, the rooms are stylish. Did not have the opportunity to try either breakfast or restaurant, but the boutique bar is excellent. 

The roof top offers an aquarium-like pool, sunloungers and deliciously strong mojitos. Utmost relaxation.",5,2013,06,25
23,Great Location,"The hotel has a great location and fairly nice rooms.  The staff seemed very attentive and nice, only issue was some of the concierge seemed a bit too eager to jump on the same internet sites you can do yourself, not exactly value add.  The restaurant for breakfast was good but needs better staffing.  There was one guy who ran around doing everything and two girls who seemed clueless.  Overall I would recommend the hotel.",4,2013,06,24
23,Its worth it,"This hotel is amazing. It is uber cool from the massive see through showers to the roof top pool. You won't regret it.
Excellent location.
Make sure to have a cockail in the bar downstairs - they are delicious!",5,2013,06,24
23,It's quite expensive but it's worth it,"I have spent 2 nights in Ohla Hotel in Barcelona in June 2013.

First we intended to spend 1 night only, but we were so amazed by the city that we decided to stay for 1 night more. The receptionist smiled and asked:

 - So you liked Barcelona so much, that you want to extend your stay for 1 more day?
 - Yes
 - Okay, you room for this night is 705, if one more night is not enough for you tomorrow - I have more rooms for you:)

And off we went for walking, sightseeing, and all the stuff people do on vacation in Barcelona. I must say 300 EUR per night is sort of a record for me in terms of a hotel price... but it looks like this is a common price in this city.

The room is great, no kids allowed, nice gastrobar in the ground floor. A very nice young lady who explained to everyone during the breakfast how the coffee machine works. This was quite an interesting lecture when about 5-6 people including myself gathered around her and the coffee machine and were listening carefully to a ""how it works"" manual:)

The hotel is also very cool in terms of location. Via Laietana is not as crowded as Passeig de Gracia, but it has a straight direct route to the Port, and it's 5 mins walking distance from all the places where tourists gather. Big bus stops, Rambla and so on. This is really comfortable.

And yes, the top floor terrace:) Wine, pool, views to the city, that was great! I enjoyed my stay and I hope to get back one day.

Thank you",5,2013,06,23
23,absolutely stunning,"really luxurious care close to all the major areas.the concierges really run the ambience of the hotel. they greet you and do everything to make you comfortable and at ease. they can organize so much its amazing. i felt i had to give them all a good tip at the end. the rooms are great. shower in the middle is spacious. beds so comfortable. room so clean. clean staff respectful. breakfasts were amazing. all juices, coffees, eggs, cheeses, pastries. dinner looked good and popular too but we explored rather.
reception check in/out is in a small area but you dont see the front staff other than that,
the pool is small and area on the roof quite hot...but then again when in barcelona no need to spend time at a pool...there is so much to do and see.
this hotel is worth the extra fee for sure. recommend+++++++",5,2013,06,17
23,First class hotel,"My boyfriend treated me to two nights here- best treat ever! We checked in, were given a glass of cava and took it up to the rooftop bar- the view and rooftop pool was truely breath-taking.
Nothing to fault about this place at all- we were treated like Royalty from start to finish. Lovely little touches like chocs on the pillows at night.
Staff excellent and told us where to go for amazing food. 
Great location too for all the sights. 
Everything spotless, lovely and unusual decor
Would love to go back sometime.",5,2013,06,14
23,Too much air fresehner/perfume - great location though!,"I stayed here in May for 1 night and had an ok experience. 
I arrived at 10am much earlier than the designated 3pm check in time, so the receptionist said he would call me when the room was ready but I never received a call, even though I was back after 3pm and the room was already ready. Anyway, no big deal, but I would have appreciated a call as I was quite jetlagged and was just killing time until the room was ready. 
Another slip up was the ""thank you letter from management"" I was given by the receptionist at check in, was addressed to another guest name instead of mine. Once again, no big issue but it just adds on some careless service qualities.

Pros: Location was fantastic, right on the main road and just a few blocks to gothic quarter and eixample shopping area if you are happy about walking everywhere. Taxi drivers know the hotel well so there was never any issues communicating the destination. 
Cute upstairs lounge area - looks a lot smaller than their photos but the views are lovely and by 4pm it was completely full with no sun beds open. 
Chocolates at turndown was a nice touch :)

Cons: One thing I really had to complain about was the room had a LOT of perfume sprayed all over the sheets and pillows to the point that it was really suffocating. They must pump it throughout the hotel because the corridors all reeked of the cheap (sorry!) smelling air freshener. Imagine the strength of perfume in the Abercrombie store - on steroids. 
Apparently you can ask room service not to spray your room but I think they are going a little overkill on it imho.

Shower had a funky smell like - cat urine.. it went away after I really washed it down.. could have just been my last guest... or lack of cleaning. Also, shower is right bang smack in the middle of the room with glass walls and no protection so don't stay there with shy friends!

Overall was a good hotel - If you are only in BCN for a short time, its a very basic and conveniently located hotel on a busy main street which felt safe even late at night on my own and it is rather affordable rate but perhaps not as glamorous and fine-tuned as the website depicts it. Didn't get to eat at any of the restaurants.",4,2013,06,14
23,A few days at the Ohla Hotel,"Great stay, good hotel, the rooftop pool was a world apart from the hussle and noise of the city - it made our mini break very special. The gastrobar on the ground floor served the best tapas I have ever tasted and the staff were very friendly. The rooms nice, with no wall between the bed and the bathroom plus a glass shower in the middle of the room, it felt larger than the small room it actually was. I would certainly recommend this hotel but next time I would splash out on a larger room.",5,2013,06,14
23,Boutique Hotel,"This boutique hotel has nice sized rooms and the location within easy walking distance to attractions, restaurants and shops.  We were greeted warmly and our room was very clean and  nicely appointed.   Morning breakfast is typical Spanish with a large selection of cheese, meats, fruit, breads, and made-to-order omelets.  Only  negative is lighting in the bathroom area could have been better as the walls were black. Wonderful staff and location.",5,2013,06,09
23,Splendid hotel in the Gothic,"We went to Barcelona and were scared by so many bad hotel reviews in Tripadvisor.  Then we found Ohla...It was everything they promissed and more.  The service is perfect, the room very nice and spacious (ok, perhaps you do not like black walls in the bathroom, but it is VERY nice and elegant).  Well located in the Gothic so you can tour the port and the Gotico by walking.  A metro station just across the street. 
Then, a Michelin starred chef with a restaurant AND a tapa bar in the hotel!!
Shame we had to leave....",5,2013,06,07
23,ohla-la,"WOW, we arrived early and after great concierge service and extremely polite (if somewhat OTT) checkin we had to wait - after camping upstairs on the rooftop bar with a couple of drinks, who cared!

The Suite was fantastic, clean modern and spacious the only downside was a slow leaking bath plug but hey!

The Bar was great and I have to say one of the best Cocktail maestros in residence made the stay even better.

Great location and friendly service - all round an enjoyable stay and would reccomend to anyone (and I'd stay again!)",5,2013,05,29
23,A few small things could be improved but overall a good hotel - would recommend!,"Overall we had a very enjoyable 3 nights at the Ohla hotel and would recommend it.  We would rate it at the bottom of the 5 star range.

Positives: Excellent location, very friendly staff, v comfortable room (we were in a design deluxe -slept amazingly well each night), amazing cocktails in the main bar (thank you, Michele!), really good concierge service.

Negatives: Only one, mid-sized bottle of water in the room per day which wasn't replaced at turn-down - would expect more from 5 star hotel; breakfast selection could have been better & would expect a 5 star hotel to be more flexible with the hot options (one included with room price); & could have done with slightly slicker service round the pool area - def had to get your own towels for the sun loungers, clear any used ones away, go to the bar to ask for drinks etc... 

The small and few negatives above did take the shine off the 5 star billing of the hotel, somewhat, but overall we had a really enjoyable stay and we would def recommend the hotel to friends.",4,2013,05,28
23,"Top hotel, top location.","The location of the hotel is great. About two minutes walking from Plaza Catalunya.
Rooms are on the small side, but very clean.
Bathroom is in the middle of the room and three of the four ""walls"" are completely transparent glass. Towels are huge and clean.
Big LCD TV, iPhone 4/4S dock in the room.
Wi-Fi is sufficient and free. Good signal in the rooms, lobby, restaurant, everywhere in the hotel.
Pool on the roof is very beautiful, but small.
Service is great, very helpful with any questions or requests.
Breakfast is not impressive. Missing the usual bacon. There is iberian ham (jamon) instead of bacon. I find that annoying, because there is no American bacon in my country and I only eat it when on vacation.
Hot dishes are served one portion per person and you have to order it specifically to the waiter. Waiters don't ask you if you'd like a hot dish. You have to ask them.",5,2013,05,27
23,"Tapas in the Bar, ohlala","I didn't stay in this hotel, but my Mum and I visited in December and ate a late supper in the bar. Exceptional tapas in wonderful surroundings to the sound of a funky jazz trio! Fab, very much recommend a visit!

The hotel is in the perfect location, easy walk to anywhere you would like to go in the city but far enough away from the over crowded spots.  The rooms are the most modern we've ever seen.  Beautiful and brand new.  Everything is top notch;  comfortable bed, great bathroom, beautiful bathtub and separate shower, tons of storage space and closet space as well.  Rooftop pool and bar is fabulous and we very much enjoyed relaxing up there with the beautiful view in the afternoons.  Stay at Olah and you will not be disappointed!",5,2013,05,18
23,Excellent hotel in a great location,"We arrived mid morning and understandably the rooms were not ready and we were ushered into the ""waiting area"" where self service coffee ,tea fruit etc was available and time to catch up on wifi which works very well throughout the hotel

The concierge staff were incredibly helpful from booking restaurants (should still do your own research )to trying to sort out my GPS - well done guys

Breakfast was adequate but perhaps could be improved upon .We had room service late one night which was tasty but expensive for the potion size 

Rooms are large and modern with a glass shower in the room leading onto the bathroom area .Only thing missing in the rooms could have been a coffee machine and kettle etc .The only rooms with baths are the suites 

The roof top with pool and loungers is a fantastic way to unwind and check out the view after a long day 

The hotel is perfectly situated downtown and 5 minutes walk to La Rambla /Gothic area / Plaza de Cathalyna etc 

Would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2013,05,12
23,Stylish Hotel in a good location,"We stayed at the Ohla in early May. The hotel is in a very convenient location in walking distance of many of Barcelona's attractions...for the remaining ones there's a Metro station just across the street.
Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms a well sized with all the comfort one needs except for the missing luggage racks.The hotel and the rooms itself is quite stylish which they unfortunately put a bit over functional design, e.g. if we weren't told we would have needed to search for the door to the toilet in our room and the makeup mirror only works for short people because it is fixed and cannot be adjusted for you. Also the way to the toilets in the public area is quite interesting as you need to take the black stairs down into a room with a black floor and black walls that they are trying to light with some lamps which by nature is rather difficult :-)
We felt very comfortable in the Ohla and would definitively return!",5,2013,05,09
23,Really enjoyable stay!,"From the moment we were checked in to the moment we were checked out we could not falter the service. Everything was very efficient and nothing was too much. The men on he concierge desk were truly amazing, even coming out into the street to help with the ticket machine. Definitely get up on the roof and soak up some of the sun. 

The only thing I could think of to find fault with is that there wasn't any information regarding the hotel (eg breakfast times or restaurant menu) or information about the surroundings (fortunately the concierge were amazing but when you're trying to arrange your following day sometimes you like to do this in the comfort of your room rather than in the lobby). Oh and the iron they supplied us with didnt work. ",4,2013,05,07
23,Best hotel ever!!!,"Great service! 
Wonderful room! Comfort big bed. Glass shower a treat.
Never been in such a good hotel.
Best location ever! 50 m from subway, 200 from ramble.
Breakfast no more then ok though, but enough.",5,2013,04,27
23,Unfortunately not a 5* service att all ....,"Hi there everyone, 
this hotel is in a fantastic location, great infrastructure but the service is not even worthy of a 3* hotel...
Any special demand: from breakfast or food at the swimmingpool ... to a decent limousine for a few hours is all very complicated for the staf ... .
In my penthouse suite i had to ask 6 times for new keys because i was always blocked in front of the door trying to get in, 6 times on 2 DAYS ?? The multimedia was not working in my room and no one off the staff had any clue how it was working... they made it work 6 hours after I checked in AND not one apology ! The breakfast buffet is very disappointing and again beneath 5star hotel.
Secondly: i took two extra rooms for some friends and at a certain moment i reached my limit with the credit card and i was continuously embarrassed IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS by the concierge and other members of the staff...they were asking me for cash on a sunday in a foreign country ?!? Of corse i payed everything very swiftly on monday-morning after calling my bank...
They are completely clueless and without any respect towards a client spending 4000 euro on 2 DAYS. They have no education at all ... and no clue how to deal with clients with absolutely normal 5 star demands.
I hope this comment is helpful for your stay in Barcelona.

23,"5 star location, 3 star hotel","The location is fantastic, the metro is across the street.Shopping and dining options are abundant all around you. 

The service at the breakfast restaurant was almost non-existent. If you wanted anything you had to walk up to the waiters and ask them. We had the buffet breakfast which was a big disappointment. A small selection of hot food from the menu, which your only allowed one item.If you want more plan to pay for it.

The room was lacking amenities one would expect in 5 star, ie kettle, iron, and tissues,coffee maker,face cloths. 

With a little extra effort this could be a great hotel. the design is fantastic, location superb, but it was a let down by the little things that make a 5 star hotel.",3,2013,04,24
23,Sangrias on the Rooftop Pool,"Charming, modern hotel in a prime location. The highlight of this hotel is the rooftop pool. One of the nicest views of you can ever experience gazing on the rooftops of Barcelona's beautiful architecture sipping on sangrias. The rooms are modern and quite large with plenty of sunlight. Perfect place to come back to after a long day at the beach or shopping.",5,2013,04,22
23,Very nice hotel in a fantastic location.,"Hotel Ohla is a very clean, modern hotel in a perfect location for exploring downtown Barcelona.  Everything at the hotel was ""good"" but did not amaze me in any way.  The breakfast was decent, but nothing exceptional.  The gastrobar was OK, but did not live up to expectations as ""one of the best tapas bars in Barcelona"" and did not deliver value-for-money.  I do not mind paying for excellent food, but 15-17 EUROS for a rather mediocre tapa, I was not impressed.  I have no complaints with the service - the staff were friendly and attentive.  The hotel has more character than any chain, which is a plus.  All things considered, especially the price, I would be inclined to try another hotel the next time I go to Barcelona.  It was good, BUT... I think there were too many ""buts""",4,2013,04,21
23,Everything Was Superb,"We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday this April. And it was the best birthday treat ever! Everything about Ohla was just wonderful, what a fantastic location, great design and top top service.

Upon arrival we were whisked promptly upstairs to the reception area and enjoyed a complementary glass of cava before being led to our 4th floor room. The room was spotless and smelled lovely and fresh. What a great way to maximise space and put the glass walled shower in the center of the room! The design is clean and simple, but the lighting, the bath products and the bed quality being the luxurious touches. The housekeeping team are clearly very dedicated and always greeted guests in the hallway.

In terms of service, we could not have been better treated. The concierge, Alberto, is a real gem. Throughout our stay he kept in close contact and made sure we were very well looked after. He helped my boyfriend in organising birthday surprises and even had a bottle of complementary cava placed in our room! The rooftop terrace bar (wow!) is manned by a young lady who was as friendly and chatty as everyone else we encountered, even the kind young chap who brought us room service at 2:30am, presented without a flaw and with a smile. 

We ate the first night in Sauc, which was phenomenal. The meal was beyond superb. The tasting menu we chose consisted of 14 courses (15 had we been able to handle the cheese course!) and each one was thoughtfully presented and extremely well executed. The service was definitely 5 star and it goes down in history as the best meal I have ever experienced. The breakfast served in Ohla Gastrobar was lovely. Fresh food, a wide range of it and all friendly staff who would accommodate any request. 

Overall, in such a bustling city it is nice to stay somewhere where you can feel the little touches. The greeting card from the team wishing me a happy birthday, the shaving kit dropped off for my boyfriend (twice!), the free wifi, the concierge carrying our bags. Some may consider this standard for any good hotel, and I agree, but in Ohla everything ran so seamlessly and peacefully that I think they deserve commendation for the service which is often overlooked.

Will stay again, will recommend!",5,2013,04,19
23,Lovely hotel in a central location,We stayed here on our last night in Barcelona . It is a lovely hotel with the charm of a much smaller place but the amenities of a large hotel. The bar tender is the best in Barcelona! Fabulous drinks! The restaurant has a star and is a real treat ,5,2013,04,17
23,Excellent Hotel in a Fantastic Location,"Just came back from a weekend at the Ohla Hotel in Barcelona and it was one of the greatest weekends I ever had.
The hotel is situated in a great location, right between the Gothic Quarter and the Born, and within short walking distance from the Ramblas, Plaza Catalonia and other attractions. 
Rooms were very comfortable and had pleasant atmosphere, with the glass shower adding to the ambiance. 
The hotel staff were extremely helpful, with great recommendations on attractions and restaurants and assisted in any way the could. 
The only down sides are that there is a bit noise from the street, but after coming late from the nights out, it didn't bother much and we just fell asleep, and the hot dishes at breakfast are very small.
All in all, if I ever come back to Barcelona, Ohla will definitely be my first choice for accommodation.",5,2013,04,14
23,Lovely Hotel in A Great Location,"Ohla hotel located in the middle of everywhere! We have google mapped all the attraction in a walking distance from the hotel to the first pint of interest, and from there to other places. The hotel located in Via Laietana 4 minutes walk to Barcelona Cathedral and 7 minutes to the Ramblas. Starbucks is just in front of the hotel main restaurant where the buffet breakfast is served. We took a junior suite which was modern, with a view to the street of the historic area. We were asked the day of booking to elect the type of pillows, sheets and bed aroma. Of course I choose Feather duvet for the Pillows, Egyptian cotton sheet 300 thread for the sheets, and Lavender for the bed sheet aroma! The bed was really comfortable!! The thing that I really loved about this hotel is the rooftop! The lounge area and the pool are astonishing. I've managed to watch the sunrise while I was at the roof, it was breathtakingly beautiful. The clouds are reflected on the pool water and the weather was amazing. There was some water at the ground on the roof the remaining of the rain from the day before, thus we couldn't sit at the lounge, we just kept looking at the beautiful view. If you are planning on visiting Barcelona I highly recommend Ohla hotel. We did not even take a bus or any kind of transpiration. We just kept walking around, and although we were there only for the weekend, We managed to visit most of the attractions. Like the Gothic Quarter, Casa Batllo, the beach which was 15 minutes walk from the hotel, and Sagrada Família around 20 minutes walk from the hotel.",5,2013,04,14
23,Cool,"We stayed 2 nights in the Ohla hotel, the area around the hotel is on a large busy street and isn't as cool as la ramblas, el borne or the Gothic area but its only a short walk to the spiderweb of streets leading to the area's I mentioned. Rooms are a bit tight but all you need is in it, beds are very comfy. Staff were helpful and friendly, nice bar downstairs for a beer or cocktail one of the waiters doing the cocktails thinks he's a bit of a celeb got slightly offended when I didn't want one. Restaurant downstairs was nice food on the fine dining side all miniature breakfast there too i.e hot breakfast is mini sausages eggs etc. Roof top bar was cool waiter from mexico very nice chap plenty of info about bars and clubs.Its a bit pricey but that's the only real downside street side a bit noisy ambulance had us up, oh and the glass shower is in the middle of the room get it well steamed up if you on the shy side.
Hope this helps someone
Me.",4,2013,04,11
23,Fabulous,"This was my third time in Barcelona for business and Ohla, definitely will be the hotel. 
Welcome drink on the arrival, private checking, FREE wifi in all the hotel (I hate these hotels where you only have wifi in the lobby), fantastic location, amazing tapas in the restaurant Gastrobar, beautiful pool in the terrace, my room was very well clean every day with turn down service...... They have a michelin star restaurant but I did not have time to try it. 
Calm atmosphere, intimate....Fabulous hotel. 
If you come to Barcelona, you can not miss this hotel.",5,2013,04,11
23,Simply not a 5 star hotel...,"I booked the Ohla after a lot of research and after staying there all I can say is the only think 5 star about it is its location and its PR agency for securing it such impressive coverage! 

I booked a junior suite and notified the hotel in advance that we would be arriving earlier than the advertising check-in and that if they could our room ready a little earlier that would be fantastic but otherwise we'd be dropping off or bags. We arrived at 11am, weren't greated as we entered the hotel until someone walked past and asked if they could help. As our room wasn't ready so early we pre-registered and left our bags to go an explore the city. We returned at 2pm (the advertised check in time) to be told that our room wasn't ready! No sorry and when I expressed my disappointment and asked why it wasn't available at the advertised time I was simply told that they were busy and that we could go shopping or buy ourselves a drink at the rooftop teraace while we waited. No apology, no gesture of goodwill. As a guest, it is simply not my problem that they are busy and have not managed their hotel properly to have rooms ready on time. And as someone who notified them in advance that they would be arriving early and staying in a more premium room, I would have expected a properly managed hotel to have prioritised the servicing of this room. But really it just boils down to the fact that the staff simply didn't care, which is anything but 5 star service. 

The next morning it got worses - got down to breakfast half an hour before it finished to discover that there no available tables and at least 5 other couple waiting to be seated - again this was apparently not their problem it was ""beause the hotel was busy"". After insisting that the hotel call me when they could accommodate us for breakfast rather than waiting for a long time in the bar, we came down to find dirty and chipped bowls and dirty cutlery,  

It was also missing other touches that I would expect in a 5 star hotel e.g. better quality sound proofing in the rooms (this is the noisiest city hotel I have ever stayed in and I stay frequently in London - the metro literally runs under the hotel) and more design features (the rooms were very plain - no painting/art or even lighting or furniture that gave visual interest and made it feel that was design-led). Towels were poor quality, there was no tea or coffee to use with the 'tea making facilities'. Our bed was never turned down and no-one asked us how our stay had been when we left. This is simply a hotel that doesn't care about its customers. 

On the plus side, it's a great location. But in the terms of our experience in the hotel - it felt like a very expensive Fawlty Towers!  I would be unhappy to have been treated they way we were in any hotel, but in one positioning itself as 5 star it is simply unacceptable! 

I wasn't just extremely disappointed, but also upset that what was supposed to be a lovely birthday treat for my husband was tainted by such a poor service experience.",2,2013,04,08
23,romantic and central,"This is a boutique  hotel, only around 70 rooms, sited very near  Catalunya Square, where the buses from Airport stop. The staff are very helpful, friendly and efficient.  Rooms are done early in the mornings and bins are often emptied during the day. A nice touch was chocolates on pillows every night and curtains drawn!

Rooms are bright. Unusually,there are no carpets, wooden floors and melanamine around the shower. 

As it was a birthday, hotel provided complimentary bottle of cava. This was unexpected and much appreciated.

Breakfast is buffet style, with additional hot dishes. I suppose the waiter on duty in the restaurant for breakfast seemed to be the most unfriendly of all the staff. He seemed to have a cunning gift of avoiding eye contact and taking orders! However, once orders were taken, food quality was excellent.

As well as two types of coffee, there were several teas on offer. 

Bedroom was spacious, clean with very comfortable bed. The shower is a feature of the room, with views to and from very interesting! 

would I return - certainly.",5,2013,04,05
23,Loved it!,"We are a couple from Canada and where enchanted by the Hotel and its sourroundings. The food was great at the tapas bar also. Friendly and helpfull staff, our concierge made sure our stay was wonderful.",4,2013,04,05
23,Best location in Barcelona,"Having not visited Barcelona before, I had no idea what to expect.  I booked Ohla Hotel and was wondering if I had made the right choice.  Only after having checked in and started to explore the city did I come to realize how lucky I was to have booked this hotel.  The location couldn't be better and the room was clean and fun with a clear glass shower, looking straight at the bed.  The hotel staff was good, especially Daniele Abbate.  He was spectacular, so helpful and caring.  In my opinion it was his service that made the hotel so special for me.  In terms of the breakfast, this was where they could change things around.  There was no fruit cut up and I didn't feel like biting into an apple, there wasn't a single vegetable in sight or smoked fish etc. And I don't eat meat so there was a croissant.........................at most, with a glass of juice to drink.  Not good.",4,2013,04,02
23,Great for couple's getaway,"Stayed for 4 nights. Perfectly situated with easy walking to shopping and many beautiful Barcelona sites. Metro is across the street. We stayed in a 'design' room - contemporary style (one queen) was designed to make good use of space making it feel larger than it was - unique glass shower surround offered little privacy, but was absolutely fine for us. In-room iPod docking station, blow-dryer, mini bar, and room safe. Concierge provided some great suggestions for out-of-the-way places for dinner - some we would have never happened upon without his guidance. Lovely roof-top terrace with a pool. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was included and it offered a great selection of food and drinks (including cava if so desired) with hours that worked well with our daily schedules. We wouldn't hesitate to stay at Ohla again on our next trip to Barcelona",5,2013,04,02
23,Good Location and Good Food,"My family and I stayed at the Olha from the 23/3/2013 to the 26/3/2013.   There are many positives about this hotel, the location, security the restaurants and the service.  I would stay there again, however I was disappointed in the Breakfast Buffet service.  The range of cereals and breads was not great but the single biggest annoyance was the fact that there was no service with regard to tea drinkers.   It was bascially coffee or nothing.  I say this because what ever the hot water was in the small jug that sat on the bench was - it was neither hot nor good water.  Dumping a tea bag in to this resulted in what was best described as lukewarm dishwater.  It was horrible.  Most good hotels take the time to serve pots with loose tea.",3,2013,03,27
23,Great location and high quality accommodation.,"My wife and I stayed for four nights during March 2013. The purpose of our visit to Barcelona was to sightsee this beautiful City. I don't think we could have found a better place to stay. Most of the major attractions are within easy walking distance and the open-top City tour busses stop conveniently close to the hotel.
It is a clean hotel and the included breakfast is excellent. If you want to splash out then the Micheline Star restaurant in the hotel will not disappoint.
Thoroughly recommended.",5,2013,03,26
23,"Quirky arty, luxurious and fantastically located","The hotel is so easy to get to.  Around the corner from Pl. Catalunya where the airport bus dropped us off.  A cava welcome with silver chocolates and a fantastically sized junior suite, with a large rain shower, which helped us off to a great relaxing start.  Breakfast was also included and well worth it.  Serving up to 11 am each morning, we had a choice of fruit, toast, cheese/ham, eggs how you like it and waffles!  Yum.  A great sunny roof terrace with a small plunge kind of pool, with great leather lounging seats.

Around the corner starbucks, if you want a large coffee rather than the smaller ones they serve in Barcelona, straight across the road the metro and all around small streets of culture, sunny squares with cafes.  

The location I cannot go on about enough, I previously came and stayed at the top of las ramblas and felt totally out of it, but that's my personal view.  Here there is loads going on and lots of small tapas bars, 15 min walk to the beach (roughly) we didn't notice as we kept winding in and out of streets.  Shops are around the corner (H&M, Benneton, Zara) and lots of small boutique shoe/handbag shops too.

We have the most fantastic stay.

We did eat in the hotel one night and the food was great.  People say it's expensive but to be honest it's no more expensive than some of the other nice restaurants.",5,2013,03,23
23,Great,"great location: 1 minute to Metro, 10 minute walk to ""la Rambla"". The service was amazing, The stuff people were very attentive, Breakfast was great.But.... the fancy restaurant in the hotel was very very bad.....",4,2013,03,23
23,"Not a 5 star, they think their doing YOU a favor","I feel compelled to write this still being a guest at this property. Been here for 3 nights and one remaining:

PROS:

-Fabulous location, Metro station 20 yards away, close to everything by foot
-Rooms well appointed and clean, sexy shower in the middle of the room (couples only!)
-Saüc deserves the Michelin star it earned and the Gastrobar stands out for their tapas. Boutique bar an experience but in my opinion 20€ + cocktails is too much. You've been warned.

CON:

-Service and attitude all around the property is awful, snobby and rude. With all due respect but Madrid and Seville hotel personnel do outperform these guys. I don't know if its a Catalan ""I feel I'm king of the world"" thing but as an example: stood right in front of the Concierge's desk at 11pm after Barça-Milan game cause I needed important information and the gentlemen in turn was on what seemed a personal phone call and didn't even acknowledge I was there for the whole 5 minutes, not even a nod or a ""please hold on for a second"". Same thing all around the hotel at the reception desk, bar, restaurant, when dialing 9 for anything you might need and you'll be lucky if you get noticed by the concierge in charge when you enter and exit the hotel (reception is in level 0.5....ok).

If you like being mistreated, this is the place for you.

RULE OF THUMB: if you are a world traveler, especially in Europe you know that real 5-star hotels represent much much more than Ohla Hotel. Sorry for your wallet but stick with the likes of Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula and the few high end exceptions. 

Señores en Ohla: o se corrigen o mueren como negocio. El servicio de calidad mundial trasciende sus fronteras provinciales.

Visca Barça!

23,Excellent,"Stayed in junior suite, very specious, comfortable bed with many pillows. Very nice decor of room and hotel. We loved the glass wall of bottles as you walk in to gastrobar. Perfect location, walking distance to most of the important places. Would definitely recommend to stay here.",5,2013,03,11
23,Great location,"This is beautiful small hotel.  The rooms are modern and inviting.  Service at the hotel is first class.  The restaurant is good but somewhat limited.  You can see many of the sites of Barcelona on foot.  Clean, modern and comfortable.",4,2013,03,10
23,4stars sharp,"The advantages:
Very helpful and polite staff, everyone seemed friendly, the building itself was stylish and nicely decorated, everything clean, comfortable beds and wide range of pillow selection. Perfect location. 

The disadvantages: 
We had stayed at the room suitable for handicapped people (which we didn't need at all, and of course that was not what we ordered). For this reason, we got a very uncomfortable bathtub instead of a shower. The glass wall did not cover anything so after each showering we had to sacrifise a towel just to mop the floor. The room was rather small, too small for our preferences. There was no coffee at the room (not a five star thing) and no ironing possibility at the room itself (once again not a really five star thing). The breakfast selection was not wide, but it wasn't a big issue as we had been staying only for 4days. 

Overall, not the worst experience, definitely. The hotel has its pros and cons, just please note that it is not a five star hotel, well at least not a 5star hotel in British or Scandinavian level. Seemed more of a 4star hotel to us. Pretty reasonable prise, though.",4,2013,03,09
23,"Beautiful, modern, wonderful hotel, perfectly located","Lovely old building beautifully updated. Great rooms (except for the lighting controls which were weird), excellent service, terrific bar, wonderful staff, excellent breakfast (included) and fabulous dinner restaurant. The hotel is not cheap, nor is the restaurant, however, it is an exceptional place and walking distance from EVERYTHING in the Gothic Quarter (old town). The Concierge was wonderful, friendly and highly knowledgable; he got us tickets to several things on-line right at his desk. I cannot imagine, unless price is a serious problem, that you can do better in Barcelona (a magnificent city, by the way, with great people).",5,2013,03,04
23,Great time !,"Pure pleasure: beautiful place decorated with elegance and style, very kind thoughts, perfect location in the heart of Barcelona...

23,Gorgeous and stylish and great location,"Very stylish building, very friendly staff and personalised service.  We had booked a junior suite which had a great view and was well equipped.  Unfortunately the mattress was hard so i cannot say it was extremely comfortable.

Fabulous location for exploration.",4,2013,02,25
23,In The Heart of Barcelona,"The Ohla Hotel occupies a great location between the Passeig de Gracia area & Barri Gotic in Barcelona. It's an old Gothic stone building from the outside but completely W-ized on the inside, if you know what I mean. Lots of black. The elevators are do dark you can barely see the numbers for the floor you want. The rooms have lots of black too. The most interesting feature is the glass-enclosed shower - which is in the middle of the room & gives about as much privacy as a goldfish gets in an aquarium. Not for the modest - or, I would suggest, families! Comfy beds, but some rooms get street noise from busy Via Laietana outside. Safe neighborhood with a large police station almost next door. Breakfast was good, not great. ",4,2013,02,09
23,Boutique Hotel in the heart of it all,"We absolutely loved this hotel. It's very modern in design and is in a lovely neighborhood, walking distance to many attractions. 
The hotel also has a great gastro restaurant with some wonderful tapas. The bar is also known for making the best cocktails in town. They are known for their gin and tonics. Not being a gin drinker I decided to try one of their other specialties and I wasn't disapointed.
The rooms were very spacious, clean, and had a nice area with a big shower with a waterfall shower head. Amazingly beautiful.
Make sure you go up to the roof top bar and pool. It's a small pool, but it's a pool! The view of Barcelona lite up at night is breathtaking. 
Breakfast was included with our stay  and it was bountiful. Jamon, fruits, eggs as you like them, and much much more offered to you by a very polite and friendly staff.
My only complaint is that we only stayed at the hotel for one night.
We are planning another trip to Barcelona this summer and this hotel is on my list! I loved it!",5,2013,02,08
23,One of the nicest - it has it all,"Great hotel in the heart of Barcelona! Booked on hotels.com and got an amazing Deal in a huge room with free breakfast + loyalty scheme Welcome Rewards credits.

It was a great location for sightseeing, shopping and things to do. Located in a safe neighborhood, with great views from the room. Housekeeping was great and reliable while the concierge and bar staff were excellent. Only downfall, the concierge wanted to steer me in another direction to a more expensive restaurant when I specified what restaurant I wanted to visit. I didn't care whether the restaurant was ""fancy"" or not. But this hotel is worth the $$. They also have an amazing rooftop with pool and bar.",5,2013,01,27

The check in was great, while sitting at the desk you are offered a glass of cava which was delicious.  The rooms were very spacious, beds were king size and comfortable and the bathroom was very modern.  The rooftop bar and pool were fantastic! It was too cool to swim however we enjoyed Cava and Mojitos (the best ever!) and delicious snacks while taking in the amazing view of Barcelona. The location was perfect for sightseeing.  Within walking distance of the Barcelona Cathedral and Las Rumblas, the hop on and off buses are also accessible in the area. The included breakfast was delicious with a wonderful assortment of foods. Staff, especially the front desk were very helpful and friendly.  We would highly recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again!",5,2013,01,23

23,A New Year's Experience,"It was our first Hogmanay away from the family in 22 years and we chose this Barcelona hotel for our holiday. This centrally located hotel is extremely good. We had never been to Barcelona before and the hotel offered to provide a car from the airport and a meal on New Year's Eve. The seven course meal was sublime The concierge was so helpful, especially in getting us to queue jump at the Sagrada Familia!  by arranging some online tickets for us. The huge room we stayed in was lovely and spacious and the complimentary bottle of Cava on New Year's Eve was a lovely touch.
We liked this hotel very much and would certainly come back to it on our return to Barcelona.",5,2013,01,18
23,luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"From the start of checking in with a glass of cava to departure this hotel was a delight, just wished we could have stayed longer than one night. Situated in the heart of Barcelona within easy walking distance to everything, this is the perfect location. Staff are extremely friendly & helpful. Huge comfortable bed. The only problem we had was that the shower down didn't close completely & therefore water from the shower leaked out under the door into the area where the sink was. Not the end of the earth, but we mentioned this to staff, who assured us that they would look into it - which I have no doubt they will. Breakfast was lovely, though their scrambled eggs were more like chopped up omelet !! They've obviously been watching BBC1's James Martin & his Saturday Kitchen as they were cooked the same.",5,2013,01,15
23,Perfect Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights right before New Years Eve.  What we liked best about the hotel were the helpful staff, especially Edgar at the front desk; convenient location to tourist sites and metro stop; excellent breakfast; stylish rooms and comfy beds.  The only drawback was that we could hear/feel the subway from our 3rd floor room.  It was subtle, but not acceptable given the cost of the room.",4,2013,01,11
23,Great birthday city break,"I chose the Ohla for our long weekend in Barcelona during which time I would celebrate my 30th birthday. We mentioned this to the hotel, who left a complimentary bottle of fizz and glasses in our room which was a nice touch. Couldn't fault the service, it was great from the moment we arrived and were offered champagne at check in, escorted to our floor in the lift and until we checked out. 

The location is very good, a short walk from Plaza Catalunya and the nearest metro station and within walking distance of the old quarter with many sights, bars and restaurants. One day we walked from the hotel to the beach and whilst it was a good walk, it wasn't really too far.

Our room was nice, it was on the third floor facing a side street and part of the main street, but there was no noise. I wasn't particularly keen on the arty kind of minimalist styling of the room, but it was fine. 

The rooftop pool is a nice place to hang out, though on some days of our stay there were lots of children in the pool splashing about which made it a bit less relaxing. I think this annoyed several older guests who had obviously chosen the hotel, like us, for a luxurious break. Also you needed to get there early, or wait around for a sunlounger as there weren't many. One thing to watch at the pool was the price of drinks - they were relatively expensive during the day, but after about 5pm, the menu switched to evening prices, which was greater still. That is fine if you order the drinks after 5pm, but if you order earlier in the afternoon but pay after 5pm you many be charged the higher price, which happened to us, so be careful. Reception were happy to amend this for us on checkout though, so it wasn't a big problem.

Breakfast was included in the room rate and served at the tapas restaurant adjacent to the hotel. Whilst it was a little minimalist and fancy for our tastes, it was fine and there were lots of cold buffet options in addition to the hot dish.

Finally, Barcelona tips - don't miss Park Guell, Casa Batllo or the authentic hole in the wall tapas places in the old quarter. My favourite was Sensi, which has great reviews on here.",4,2013,01,10
23,Great stay!,"We had a great 5 days in Ohla Hotel.  We booked the junior suit and it was perfect.  Helpful staff, good breakfast, great location.  The bar is a nice place to have a cocktail; they make the best Dry Martini!
      ",5,2013,01,09
23,"Great location, friendly staff, good hotel","Stayed three nights over new year. We have visited Barcelona many times and this hotel is definitely in the best location for getting around Barcelona.
Very stylish hotel with staff that seem happy in their work and are consequently good at it. 
Slick trouble free check in. Breakfast served until 11.00am with a good choice of food on offer...hotel provided us with two bottles of complimentary Cava on two evening, one being New Year's Eve .The hotel has a great bar and the bar tender, Guiseppe makes some really great signature cocktails...
The only thing we found disappointing was the fact that there wasn't any in room movie channel and a limited choice of international channels for overseas travellers. Overall we had a very relaxing stay and when next in Barcelona in March we will return.",4,2013,01,04
23,Ohla Review,"First, it is important to note that this is only a two year old hotel. Some cabs don't even know how to get there, so be prepared with the address or simply tell the cabie that the hotel is across from the palace of music in the gothic quarter. Location wise, the hotel is ideal. It is right smack in the middle of everything. You could walk almost anywhere, but I suggest a cab for the famous cathedral and gardens. 

The hotel itself is very friendly and professional. It's a very modern decor boutique (small) hotel. English is not a problem. The staff will bend over backwards for you. Their suggestions are good ones and they will make reservations for you.  

The main restaurant is good, but pricey. Not really worth the money in our opinion, but we were also there when the menu was fixed and quite unique. Look it up online and see what you think of the menu. You'll have breakfast and/or lunch in the smaller restaurant. Breakfast was a nice spread of meats, cheeses, breads, fresh juices, coffee, tea, etc., plus you get one hot dish included and made to order for you (e.g. eggs). The bar/lounge is another small space. The drink menu is extensive/impressive and the presentation is lovely, but be prepared for $10-20 dollar drinks (each). 

The rooms are spacious enough. Most come with a completely glass (aka completely see through) shower that is right in the middle of the room. If you're traveling with a friend, parent, etc., you might want to mention this and choose a different room when booking. My husband and I have known each other for 20 years and we were still a little shy about it. 

Negatives/needs improving:

- Water temps are not constant; you're always adjusting 
- No vent in the toilet closet
- The lighting is unique and usually adequate, but which switch controls what is very confusing 
- Ladies, the lighting in the bathroom is dim. Not great for putting on make-up
- The english speaking TV channels are very limited and are mostly news related; bring your own enterainment 
- The beds are hard and the pillows are very soft, which can make for an interesting/frustrating night's rest
- The windows do not open for those who like fresh air, though the air-conditioning and heating are both great; we were told that it was a safety concern
- There was really only one great concierge (left him a big tip). There was one that was completely misleading with his information and was a little rude. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again. However, I agree with a lot of the reviews here that I probably would have given it four stars instead of five. It's missing the polish that you would expect of a five star, but I think it has potential.",4,2013,01,04
23,Why is this not a 3 star??,"I had high expectations, apparantely the Ohla bar is one of the places to hang in the summer  months. The design, they said, was really cool and something else.
When we arrive we wondered if we were in the right place but it did say Ohla by the entrance. No recpetion to be seen and noone around, after looking around and asking another guest told us that the reception was on the first floor. So we went up. Waited to check in while the couple infron did the same whilst enjoying a glass of champagne. When it was our turn we were told our room was not ready yet (which was ok, it was only 12.30) We did the check in procedure anyway but were not offered a glass of champagne... I did not really want one but it makes you feel awkward when you are not even offered a glass. The elevator did not work for our floor so we always had to get off at one floor below and then walk. The room as such was rather spacious and bright, lovely bathroom but the room as such felt like a 3 star standard very boring room.  We paid 285 Euros per night for 4 nights and I feel that the standard should have been corresponding to the price tag. It si in a great location so you can walk everywhere but I do not see who would stay there when there are true 5 star properties available at roughly the same rates and paying this kind of money one really wants to get the 5 star feel!",3,2013,01,02
23,"Remarkable Service, in a shiek, boutique hotel, with a great location!","We arrived and we were immediately greeted by a pleasant and very competent concierge!  He quickly showed us to the reception area, just up the stairs and around the corner, where we were to check in.  Before we even started checking in the reservationist offered us both a selection of hot and cold beverages to drink, while we check in.  Nice touch.  We each had their chilled green tea.  We were checked in with a lovely attitude, and at a nice speed, not too slow, or too fast, just right.  We got our keys, and then headed to our room.
  Once at our room, WOW is all I can say.  It was spacious, with a terrace, and a two story loft style layout.  A living area, a dinning area and plenty of shelving to unpack and stow your luggage.  And it was designed very tastefully, kind of modern chic, great colors, and amazing lights on the ceiling that were White during the day, but with the touch of a button, you could change the lights to a almost cobalt blue.  A very cool effect.  Our room had 2 large Bang and Olufson flat screen TV's, a Bang and Olufson iPod dock that sounded terrific, with a mix on an iPod, they provided.  Bed was firm and comfortable, linens were nice..  What more can I say?
  The Pool deck was fabulous, great views, and a wonderful place to have a drink.  The pool itself was gorgeous, but it wasn't heated, and it needs a little refinishing on the floor of the pool.  It looked a little shabby.
  The location was just great, we could walk almost everywhere we wanted to go.  Aside from some taxi trips to various restaurants and sights.  We we near the Barri Gothic Quarter I believe.
  Room service for breakfast everyday, was terrific.  The food cooked perfectly, seasoned right, and made with fresh ingredients.  Fresh made juices, pastries, fruit of the day..  you name it, it was delicious.
  I must say that the hotels concierge really helped us plan our trip, before we arrived through email, and then once we were at the Ohla. They were extremely concerned that we had an amazing stay at their hotel.  And THIS, I can assure you we did!  I say try out the Ohla Hotel, and forget the W, or the Hotel de Arts..  You won't be disappointed.",5,2012,12,30
23,not quite a 5 stars,"Beautiful modern hotel, spacious room, weird bathroom :with no door which could be awkward when staying with a friend.. , hot water irregular at peak times. water leaks from shower door,. The service was excellent. people friendly and professional. Th television could have more international channels for the non Spanish speaking guests.
Overall a nice experience, would recommend it",4,2012,12,28
23,Chic rooftop area,"This Boutique hotel receives positive points for the roof top area which is great for enjoying some afternoon sun.  The service we found very normal, however correct.  Nothing special or over the top.  If the weather was a little warmer we would have made full use of the gorgeous pool.  The roof area looks great and we made the most of the terrace and lounges.  Good for walking everywhere.",4,2012,12,14
23,Modern hotel in a great location,"We stayed in the Ohla for a short two night stay. The hotel is boutique style with a black theme.  That can be a little oppressive, and we were glad we weren't staying longer.  The room was nice with the special attraction of having an open plan bathroom in the room with a shower in the middle.  Unfortunately the bed was incredibly hard and gave me backache, also the windows wouldn't open without a special key and so was a little stuffy.  The breakfasts were superb however and the tapas bar worth a special visit - probably the best tapas in Barcelona. Overall we liked the hotel, but it wasn't without its faults.",4,2012,12,09
23,Barcelona Love!,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. It was in the perfect location- close to everything. Las Ramblas, Placa Catalunya,Gothic Qtr and Psg de Gracia are all within a short walk. Lots of great shopping and restaurants around. The room was spacious and comfortable. I have to say that I felt a little bored with the room, it was very simple and bland. And did not offer anything ""special"" for a five star hotel. Also there was no separation or way to close off the bathroom from the living room- since I was traveling for work and had a friend with me- they were always woken up by me getting ready in the bathroom since it was a small space. 

The service was great, Alfredo, the conceirge was amazing and helpful. You can tell he really enjoys his job and helping guests. Although, I guess we came during an offer season because as the restaurant recommendations from the hotel were good, we were the ONLY table in two of the restaurants that we had them recommend for us. We knew that dinner starts later in Europe so reservations were for 9:30/10 PM, but still there were no other tables seated in the restaurant. Finally on the last night, we brought it to their attention and they recommend a great restaurant with a lot of life and fun down in Port Olympic which was great. 

The restaurants in the hotel were great. We went to the bar for drinks one night and also ate breakfast every morning. Very simplistic spread for breakfast but, of course, offered great meat, cheeses and pastries!  

Overall great stay and I would recommend this hotel.",4,2012,12,03
23,good price-quality rate hotel,"We stayed in this hotel in a junior suite.
De location is great, in the city centre and near a metro station.
As soon as we stepped in the lobby, the staff took our suitcases and told us they would be brought to the room.
Check in was good, formal but friendly and we were offerd some water or cava.
We had a junior suite on the 6th floor and the room was modern, spacious and clean. Very comfortable.Complementary water and also a water cooker.
Nice personal touches like a bottle of cava for both our birthdays.
And personal messages in an envelop like the time for check out and weather forecast.
The breakfast is small for a 5 star, but there is a reason for that: they definitely go for quality and not quantity. Really fresh bread and pastries, fresh fruit, and a hot dish per person, made on order.
We had very nice stay at this hotel and would recommend",4,2012,11,27
23,"Good, but for 5* it should be better","Well located within walking difference of everything. Sleek and modern and I had a lovely double room with an incredibly comfortable double bed. Slightly odd shower cabinet in the middle of the room with clear glass on both sides. I presume I was allocated this room as I was travelling alone. If you were a bit bashful or travelling with a friend this may pose you an issue!

Lovely rooftop area with tiny swimming pool which I didn't use as it was too chilly in November.

Check in experience was very poor. I arrived at 10pm and only once check in desk was open. There were 4 people ahead of me and with the reception area being an odd, small layout it was a very uncomfortable experience especially with a tired, late arrival.

I also found breakfast extremely disappointing. There was a cold continental buffet with a range that would be fine for a 3* hotel, but not a 5*. There were limited fruits, breads, and only one coffee machine for a hotel of this size. 

In addition, one hot item is included which you order a la carte. On my first morning I ordered pancakes. I received ONE small pancake with a dollop of jam...incredible!!! On the second day, I ordered omelette with potatoes and onions which was OK but nothing special - in fact a little greasy. On the third, I didn't bother as it was busy and failing to get any waiting staff's attention I decided, for the quality of the food, it was not worth the wait.

Finally the layout of the hotel with the reception area on a mezzanine level, and only a concierge desk on the ground floor meant that any late return to the hotel required a buzz on a door bell and a wait for the door to be attended (the desk was never manned when I arrived back), which was an annoyance and, again, not what I expect at a 5* hotel",3,2012,11,27
23,Special and modern hotel,"It's a very special and modern hotel. The main feature is that of a facade with particular applications. I stayed at this hotel in the winter, then I didn't try the terrace and the pool that look very beautiful.
Inside, the lobby is very accurate but small. The room is furnished with great care and modernity.
The hotel is also a good restaurant although a bit expensive.
The hotel has a very good location, the metro stop is in front.",5,2012,11,27
23,Difficult to rate - amasing v's poor in the one building....,"We really struggled to rate this hotel.. Firstly our checkin was awful, wrong key wrong room * 2 , 20 minutes later it was sorted!!!

Room smelt the whole time we were there - think it was the strange shower in the middle of the room situation which made it smell of toilet!!  

Restaurant - fantastic, we had a fab meal in SAUC

Roof terrace - we loved every minute of it, both at night and in the day!!!",4,2012,11,24
23,Wish we had more time!,Great location for getting around the city! Only planned a one night stay at the end of our cruise and wish we had more time to stay and enjoy Barcelona and this hotel. Spectacular views from the rooftop terrace. Breakfast was included and was nice. One hot plate was include and made fresh when you ordered. We will definitely stay here again when we return.,5,2012,11,12
23,Oh La Hotel Barcelona,"Stayed here for 3 nights in September 2012, travelled as a couple. The hotel and staff were fantastic from start to finish - nothing was too much trouble for them.  The bar staff worked hard and made some lovely cocktails.  The hotel was very central and perfect for exploring the city, the concierge gave great advice and helped with our sightseeing plans. We stayed in a Junior Suite, lovely room, spacious enough for us and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever had in a hotel.  The hotel itself was very clean and modern, the roof top views were fantastic. Breakfast was lovely, omelettes on request, along with all the pastries and fruit you could want.  Overall brilliant hotel and location.  I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone!",5,2012,11,10
23,"Fabulous hotel, fabulous location ...","Just a 20 minutes taxi ride from the airport and we stepped into the beautiful Ohla Boutique Hotel - tip, take the address of the hotel with you (to present to the taxi driver) as the hotel is not well known enough (yet) for the drivers to find easily. 

The facade of the hotel is simply stunning and the intentionally gothic appearance continues inside with the black floors and walls that greet you as you walk into the lobby. The reception has been surprising placed on the 0.5 floor and not in the entrance as you'd expect, so you are greeted by the concierge - who are utterly charming and super helpful.

We had room 603, which had a glass shower literally in the middle of the room (looked amazing), very contemporary design, bright and super clean! We looked out on to Via Laietana, which is one of the main roads through the Gothic Quarter, which is what makes this location so fabulous! You really are in the heart of the thriving Gothic area of Barcelona and central to absolutely everything. 

We walked our legs off after a brilliant breakfast, which was complimentary including one hot dish each - and relaxed with a cocktail from the bar many hours later, which boasts one of the worlds best bartenders (so we were told). The staff were helpful and courteous and we really can't complain about anything. 

The hotel is definitely one we will visit again and again - I wouldn't even bother to look at another hotel - Ohla is simply perfect. Our friends have already taken our word and have booked for December 2012! 

Thank you Mr and Mrs Smith!",5,2012,11,09
23,Stand your ground,"I was disappointed to have met such an unfriendly receptionist who checked me on the booking day.
This lady attempted to charge me an extra 59Euros for my 2 year old daughter who I had already booked and paid for.
After showing her my receipt from Hotels.com she reluctantly withdrew this extra charge 'as a one off'.

The next morning when checking out she then asked a further 5 euros from me for a so called 'city tax'. I again disputed this as I had previously stayed in a hotel just a few blocks away (Hotel sixtytwo) and they hadn't charged me for this. So once again I presented her my hotels.com confirmation stating that I had paid ALL taxes to which she replied ""I'm going to take the money from your card anyway"" - I was in disbelief. Later that same morning I discovered that she had in fact taken this from my card. I did not authorise her to take this from my account. Thankfully My credit card company have handled this well and they have rejected this charge from my account.

The concierge were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and tidy. The location was also very good but With such a bitter aftertaste left in my mouth with the receptionist I have no intention of returning to this hotel.",1,2012,11,08
23,Ohla hotel = absolutely lush!! Delux double,"Myself and my friend stopped here for 3 nights, from the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty, all staff are so helpful no matter what you want, this hotel can be for the young and older. The rooms are gorgeous with amazing views! Very central to everything you want to do and lots of shops, the breakfast was very tasted and offered a variety of dishes. We were treated lovley from the moment we arrived till we left anything we wanted they tried there best. The rooms were very clean and big, cleaned every day, the hotel roof pool was amazing with breathtaking views from it with lovely pool side seating ( only thing is its not heated) BUT FANTASTIC ALL TOGTHER!",5,2012,11,01
23,Amazing stay - highly recommended,The Ohla Hotel is an amazing hotel with clean and wonderful rooms. It is in a great part of town and allows for access to many things in the area. The bed was comfortable and clean. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful. I also enjoyed the services of the spa which were great - highly recommended. The rooftop pool is amazing and allows for great views of the city. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2012,10,26
23,wonderful stay,"The rooms were amazing, the place was very well located and the staff friendly. will come back for sure. the food was also very good. It is walking distance to a lot of the places as well. It is something nice and fun in this hotel. the concierge was very helpful and will help with everything they can. Didn't get to try the pool but saw the place and it is very nice located at the roof deck.",5,2012,10,24
23,"Cool hotel, small, with great staff and perfect location. Great view from the rooftop pool.","Great hotel with excellent staff. Super well located in the part of town near many of the best museums, architectural gems, and restaurants. Two excellent restaurants and a pool on the roof.  Breakfast room service was excellent and the Concierge were very helpful in advance by email and when we were there in person.",5,2012,10,23
23,Perfect hotel in a great city,"We have just returned from a two night stay at the Ohla Hotel.  The hotel is located in a great part of the city, only 400m or so from Placa Catalunya, so nearby to the metro and bus services and easy to orientate yourself even if in Barcelona for a short city break.

On arrival we were warmly greeted by the concierge team and directed to the hotel reception.  The check-in process was both efficient and of the standards you would expect from a 5* hotel; a glass of cava and great customer service.  This same standard of service was something we experienced throughout our stay.

As we arrived early, we were offered a space to change, leave our bags and the offer of a phone call once the room was available.  Barcelona is such a great city to enjoy at any time of the year, and being located so centrally means you are able to walk through the main tourist destinations easily; the Ramblas, La Pedrera, Casa Battlo, Sagrada Familia, shopping streets, the Port area, etc.  As we only had a two day stay this enabled us to maximise our time in the city.

Our room was a Design Deluxe on the 4th Floor, and we found this to be perfect for our requirements and taste.  The design is contemporary and fitted out to a high standard.  The open plan design made the room seem bigger, and the large windows were great - nice, modern and light.  The central glazed shower was a cool focal point and the bed extremely comfortable - our sleep helped by the extensive walking through the city and the great food and drink you can enjoy whilst in Barcelona!

The breakfast was excellent, good coffee and a range of buffet style breakfasts available - fresh croissants, juices, yoghurt as well as a choice of small - but very well cooked - hot breakfasts.  I enjoyed the waffles on both days, not the healthiest of options but it was a holiday and a chance to enjoy some great food.  The breakfast also included (if you wanted) some ice chilled cava, so for romantic breaks or just sheer extravagance it was the opportunity for a special start to the day.

We enjoyed the roof top terrace on one evening, not for swimming, but for enjoying our complimentary bottle of cava in a great setting - beautiful views across the city in a well designed setting.

Overall we were delighted with our choice to stay at the Ohla Hotel - we would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to friends, and hope to return ourselves at some point in the future.",5,2012,10,22
23,Fun hotel,"Really enjoyed a night at the Ohla.  The staff were great.  Checking in was a pleasure including a glass of cava.  The congiere service was really helpful.

Our room was perfect except it strangely didn't have a full length mirror.  Didn't have a bath but that was a plus for me as I prefer a proper shower.  The bed was amazingly comfortable.

Sadly we didn't get to try the pool as the weather was fairly wet.",5,2012,10,21
23,Well located and very accommodating staff,"A relatively small boutique hotel that is very well located, within walking distance of a number of attractions, such as the Picasso museum, Las Ramblas, Plaza Cataluña, La Boqueria Market etc. The staff is extremely helpful from the manager to the excellent concierge. And while this hotel is not to be compared to the ""grand dames"", such as the El Palace in Barcelona or the Westin in Madrid that are in baronial palaces and are all 5 stars, this hotel gets five stars from me beacuse of the people that run it,it's location and the somewhat quirky but very nice design of its rooms.",5,2012,10,18
23,Just book it,"Glass of wine at the reception , very good service , junior suite perfect and dont forget to use the swimming pool on the roof. Cant be better location , we just loved it. Breakfast great and they have a michelin star restaurant in the hotel that we didnt try, will do next time.",5,2012,10,10
23,"Comfort, convenience and class in one perfect package.","We stayed at Ohla and found it to be a top class venue, from the warm and efficient check in with ice cold Cava to the delicious breakfasts and excellent facilities. The roof top terrace with loungers, cocktail bar and rim flow pool is a must. The location is also ideal. Close to Las Ramblas, theaters and shops. We walked everywhere. If you are lucky enough to come to Barcelona, do yourself a favour and stay at Ohla.",5,2012,10,03
23,family trip,"We stayed at the hotel as a young-adult couple with parents in September.  Location is great - easy to walk to a lot of sites and cabs were always easy to hail from hotel lobby.  Rooms were spacious and nicely appointed, but glass shower in the middle of the room was just weird, and as others have noted had major leaks to bathroom floor. 

Breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was great - good food and lots of choices, nice way to start the day in such a wonderful city.  Concierges were helpful in giving us maps and directions, but otherwise we figured out what to do on our own. 

Nice stay but would probably try a different hotel next time.",4,2012,10,03
23,It's a fake five star hotel!,"We were supposed to stay in this hotel for five nights. This is definitely not a five star luxury hotel. I wonder who rates these hotels in Barcelona! 
The photos in the website are much nicer and glamorous. The major problem with our experience was that when you expect to stay at a five star luxury hotel and arrive at the Ohla Hotel, you feel really cheated! The rooms are large and that is the best thing about this hotel. The area rug in the room is dusty and when you walk on it, you can feel it. They have picked a dark color area rug with glitters on it so you won't see how dirty it is. The smell of food is all over the hallways which is disgusting. There are no wash towels in the room, we had to ask for it. The staff are nice but are NOT trained for a luxurious place. When you shower, water flushes out of the door, you end up having a little flood outside. The breakfast set up and service is very similar to cafeterias in US and the staff at breakfast they treat you like you are not supposed to be here. They serve you in a way that you need to eat and get the hell out of here. The worst staff are at the breakfast. The most hideous experience is the concierge, we asked for a high quality restaurant to have dinner, not so far from our hotel, he make a call to this restaurant to see if they have any tables available, claims this is a very high end restaurant where locals go and it's not touristy, when we get there, it looks like a glamorous cafeteria, with photos of foods and dishes all over their windows, very similar to fast food restaurants anywhere in the world. There is one person eating there and the restaurant is completely empty. ( the name of this glamours place is Nayers) We laughed and walked out. We made sure we would immediately go back to the reception and change our check out date so we only had to stay at this fake five star hotel for only one night. We immediately got a cab to the Mandarin Oriental which is very close by and booked ourselves a room for the rest of our stay! Stay a way from this hotel if you are thinking this is five star hotel. But if you are okay with 3.5 star average hotel, this is a great place and a wonderful value.",3,2012,09,26
23,Fabulous hotel - staff were okay,"I recently spent two nights at Hotel Ohla on my honeymoon.  We enjoyed the hotel and thought it was very lovely.  The downfall (as others have commented) is the staff.  We asked for restaurant recommendations and one of the recommendations we didn't even feel safe going in.  When we asked for our car to be pulled up they told us they couldn't find our keys. 

Otherwise we really enjoyed the hotel and the location.  The rooftop terrace is incredible and a fabulous way to unwind after exploring the city.  I would recommend staying at the hotel.",4,2012,09,26
23,Great hotel shame about the staff,"Stayed here for a romantic getaway in August. First impressions of hotel was stunning, very modern clean feel to it. The check in service was quick and very accommodating. Rooms again modern and well set out. Location excellent not rough as a few reviewers have said. My biggest complaint the staff. Ok the breakfast was a joke. A few pastries sitting on the bar with help yourself coffee and a supposedly made to order egg list. We had breakfast twice and were never offered eggs once. Second big complaint was roof terrace service. After a wonder about barca before going to our roomto get ready for dinner we went for a couple of cocktails on the roof terrace ie pool bar. The pool is tiny if that matters to you. The service was shocking wait 15 minutes for someone to take your order, another 15 to make your drinks and walk the 5 feet to serve you then  Another wait to payyourbill. So me thinking a tip would go a long way tipped the staff. After my meal in the Michelin starred restaurent that wasn't anything great. We went up to the roof terrace for a couple of cocktails. Same staff, same crap service. All in all loved the hotel, loved barca not to happy with the staff.",3,2012,09,23
23,"Great position, clean and comfortable","The hotel is in a great position, set amongst a warren of narrow streets with interesting buildings, shops and restaurants. The hotel building itself is beautiful (although I'm not so sure about the additonal eyeball style things stuck all over the outside).
Inside, Ohla is clean, with the modern feel consistent throughout. The room itself was good, comfortable bed and large desk area. Downsides are the bathroom area (open plan with no door) was decorated with black tiles which made the area very dark. Not a problem in itself, but the only mirror in the room was in the bathroom, so a mirror in the brighter bedroom area would have been good. The usual over-priced mini bar was provided, but no complimentary tea/coffee making facilities, which was a shame.
Overall, we loved the area the hotel was in but probably wouldn't go back to that particular hotel.",4,2012,09,18
23,Amazing hotel for an amazing Barcelona experience :),"Rooms were awesome! The shower was right in the center of the room and was a very cool change from a traditional hotel room. The toilet in the hidden room was unusual but really cool as well. Rooms were immaculate and the staff waits on you like no other- helped with luggage, calling taxis, making reservations at any restaurant in Barcelona, translating over the telephone for us when we had to call the airline! Breakfast was very good- they actually had American coffee which I couldn't find anywhere in the city, even at Dunkin donuts. A huge plus. beds were super comfortable. A bottle of champagne awaited us, as we were there for our honeymoon. Pool was really cool and different. Overall- we had a really great experience and recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2012,09,17
23,Great Hotel!,Lovely hotel. Great quirky bar  with unusual cocktails. The food in the downstairs restaurant was always good too. Nice pool area on the roof and the rooms were bigger than most others we have had in Barcelona. Very trendy!,5,2012,09,16
23,Marvellous Hotel Centrally located with Rooftop Pool,"Over the last 10 years, there has been an increase of upscale boutique hotels in Barcelona and having wanted to stay there for some time, we had been looking at them in detail. The Ohla looked very good and the price also seemed reasonable.

Upon arriving at the hotel, our expectations were immediately exceeded. The hotel is set in a beautiful corner building overlooking a small square and avenue. Decorated in ultra modern tasteful decor (spanish contemporary) and blacks and neutrals, we were very happy.

The room itself overlooked the square at the front of the hotel and even considering we were surrounded by buildings, the detail in the surrounding architecture was fascinating in itself. Furnishings in the room were plush and upscale and the bathroom design was both functional and minimalist modern.

We ate in the hotel's tapas restaurant and we were impressed with the food. Service was sharp and thorough, and we weren't waiting long for our food. The tapas were delicious and very authentic with a few outside influences on the menu.

We also visited the hotel bar on the other side of the hotel. The bar was, to be expected, also modern contemporary in style and was surrounded in glass from top to bottom. We were very relaxed there and enjoyed a few cocktails, which were the speciality of the bar staff there. The bar also attracted a fair amount of passing trade.

One of the main attractions of this hotel was the rooftop pool. Innovatively placed against a wall, the pool was a kind of fish-tank style which allowed for a good sized pool on the roof of this old building. There were lots of sun loungers around the roof in different locations and a bar of course for some mid summer supping and evening relaxation. The way they have managed to get this pool onto the roof is quite amazing.

Location-wise, hotels around there seems to be marked upon proximity to the Rambla. The Ohla was around 10 minutes stroll from there through the windy Barcelona passeigs to the middle of La Rambla. Plenty to see on foot in the area including Barcelona Cathedral and enivirons. The Sagrada Familia around 10 mins by cab, Parc Guell around 15, and the nightlife in Barceloneta less than 10 mins.

We are planning on returning here next year and thoroughly recommend this as it's great value for money.",5,2012,09,16
23,"Nice Hotel, needs improvement on service","i went to Barcelona to celebrate my wedding anniversary. I chose the Ohla for the location, which in fairness it is probably the most central you can imagine. The experice was quite weird, you go in and on the right there is the concierge desk but no reception. You need to walk up half a floor to find a very trendy receptions which consists of separate office desks. It fells like you are going to book a holiday rather than checking in an hotel. Our room was the deluxe on the 6th floor. Very nice room, the glass shower is really cool, Toilet is hidden away. We had a balcony but it was locked (a shame). apparently no guests have the abiltiy to go on balconies. Room was clean, spacious, and nicely decorated. TV was big. I ordered a bottle of Cava, strawberries and chocolate ... i was expecting to find it in the room but the reception called me after a couple of hours to find out when i wanted it delivered. i actually preferred that. Gym is very small, there is a small sauna and treatment room. The sky bar on the 8th floor is really nice. The space is small but the pool is funky and unusual. Views from there are excellent. One thing to say is that we came here a few times and every time we had to walk up to the bar to order. Waiters were there but were just talking to each other... not expected in a 5 star hotel. 
Breakfast is nice, good selection but again, service is very poor. My wife waited over 30 min for an omelette and i waited over 40 min for a hot breakfast at which stage i decided to cancel. The following morning we also had an issue with the coffees ... didn't arrive at all. When i enquired they were there in 30 sec. So we came to the conclusion that the issue was with one single waiter who kept forgetting things and didn't seem to bother. This was the only negative thing i can say about this hotel. 

overall judgement is good. Nice building, fenomenal location, nice room with cool shower, small SPA, small gym, nice rooftop bar and pool. Need to improve service. If i went back to Bcn i would probalby try it again to see if they picked up on the reccomandations.",4,2012,09,11
23,WONDERFUL STAY!,"The service was very good, from everybody we came into contact with. The reception staff were wonderful offering friendly advice, and happy to book restaurants we had researched.
The room we had was big, with beautiful smelling quality amenities. Breakfasts were good without too much of the usual rubbish you get at a buffet. Eggs to order and lovely cured specialty meats etc...
The location was good, not too close to Las Ramblas, but well within walking distance.
Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2012,09,11
23,A great experience,"We stayed 6 nights and overall a fantastic experience.  We changed our junior suite from 211 which was nice but the bathroom was so dark. We changed to 604 and that was a good move, better light and fantastic view. The rooms ending in 11 have a great aspect.The rooftop bar is intimate with stunning views.  Breakfast was good with lively view to the street. We found the overall hotel service to be efficient, caring and informative.",5,2012,09,10
23,Should be four star,"A very good hotel. I loved the rooms and the design of the shower. There are also quite a few English channels on the TV which is useful for news. The breakfast was good but you had to get up and help yourself to coffee. Quite a lot of hotels will server coffee and tea to the table even with buffet breakfasts. The only problem with my room was that it faced the street and was very noisy. When you check in make sure that you ask for a room that does not face the front.
I found the check in and check out experience very bizarre as it is too formal and the whole process seemed to be like a job interview. It involves you sitting in front of an office desk as you check your bill. Overall not bad though",4,2012,09,10
23,Ohla offered a warm welcome to a fascinating city,"Albert set the tone for our stay here by warmly greeting us andmaking useful suggestions for making the most of our three day stay in Barcelona.   Our room was spacious, by European standards, well-appointed and immaculate.  The hi-tech plumbing and electrical components are more novelty than practicality, but fun, nevertheless.   High quality linens and excellent mattress were perfect respite for our jet-lagged bodies. Breakfast was fresh and offered many options.   The roof top pool is a wonderful way to view the city, where Alessandro extends the same warm hospitality we have experienced while staying at Ohla.",5,2012,09,10
23,Perfect,"Perfect location in Barcelona, close enough to walk to most points of interest but not too noisy, great hotel, most comfortable bed I've ever slept in and super modern decoration in rooms, convenient to have wi fi facility in room.   Breakfast great, staff were very helpful and friendly",5,2012,09,09
23,Not 5 star service,"Lovely building in a great location. Rooms are spacious and very cool and comfortable. Breakfast was poor (for a 5 star hotel). Average food but very tight space and very poor service. Worse thing being told that we could order only one of the hot dishes as otherwise we would be charged extra (the case was that we did not want any hot food and had enough with the buffet but the comentary delivered in quite poor English felt quite mean). In any case, no one came to our table to ask if we wanted any hot dish. Coffee was quite bad.

Service all the way through, from check in to check out felt friendly enough but a bit unprofessional, definitely not 5 star level. At a 4 star level and price, this hotel would probably work much better.",3,2012,09,04
23,Excellent Stay in total luxury.  Rooftop pool area is beautiful,I stayed here for a short while for business and a bit of pleasure. Got an early checkin which was a bonus.  Stayed in the Junior Suite room 311.  Very quiet room not facing the main street.   Very large with a lounge area.  Note it has a balcony but you cannot go on it.  You can ask the consierge to open the windows for you to let some natural air in. You also get to choose your quality of bedding! The best is the rooftop pool area with stunning views of the city.  If you go early enough or late in the afternoon you can get a sun lounger.  The pool is large enough to swim in.  Its made of glass and is very refreshing in the hot sun. The views are amazing.  The michelin star restaurant Sauc is an experience not to be missed!!   The advantage of room 311 is that the shower is not in the middle of the room like other rooms and you cannot hear a thing at night!  The staff are very attentive and speak very fluent english.  Note the drinks are very very pricey!!  14 Euro for a Gin and Tonic!  If you want to save money on drinks there is a supermarket across the road on Via Laietana.  Breakfast is very good as it was included in the price.  Go before 10am to be seated.  Overall its very well located near to all the main attractions.  For the beach take a taxi to Marbella beach.  Taxi fares are very reasonable to get anywhere from the hotel. This hotel should be in the top 10!,5,2012,09,01
23,"Excellent hotel, great location in Barcelona","We stayed in the Ohla Hotel in Barcelona in July 2012. The hotel is located about 10 mins walk up from the marina next to the Plaza Catalunya and Barri Gothic areas in the city centre. We found the hotel was chic and sophisticated. We were greeted by the bell staff on arrival and we were allowed early check-in which, given we arrived before lunch, we really appreciated. The room was very large, overlooking the side street, well-appointed and a fabulous bathroom. We were offered our choice of pillows and slept very well there!

A roof-top pool in Barcelona is a must, and we loved the roof terrace bar/pool area of the hotel. The pool is not Olympi-size, but we were in the city centre, and the chance to cool off after trekking the town all day was great! The views from the terrace are also fantastic.

We ate in Souk, the hotel's Michelin-starred restaurant, on the weekend. The food was excellent, in fact some of the best we have eaten. You have to try the chocolate signature dessert, you will ""WOW"" when the server brings to the table! Main courses were also excellent.

We cannot understand why Ohla is not higher up on TripAdvisor ratings. Reading the reviews, we think the smaller rooms are not as good as the suites, we recommend the Junior Suite for your stay. The service and breakfast were also excellent. Thank you Ohla for a great weekend, we were so pleased with our stay.",5,2012,09,01
23,"Amazing Hotel, Great Service","We have just returned from two nights at this hotel and can say that we thought it was excellent. The location is very central to the Gothic area. The Main Gothic church is about a two minute walk away with Las Ramblas only 4/5 minutes away when walking.

The hotel was afntastic. We booked a junior suite and was very happy with the standard, size, cleanliness etc.

ALthough we only ate breakfast and one evening meal at the Gastronmic restaurant, i can say the food and sevice was excellent. we tried to book in at the Michelin star restaurant whilst we were there, but unfortunately the restaurant was full. Book in advance when you book your room if you are thinking of going.

The roof top pool was amazing with a ample sized glass swimming pool and assortment of seats beds and chill out areas. At 1900 hours the pool closes down and the venue is turned into a roof top cocktail bar....brilliant if you like that type of venue. We really appreciated a couple of hours each evening before heading out for dinner. The cocktail were of the best standard i have experienced anywhere else.

Barcelona is very spread out as a city so be prepared for a good walk or try a sight seeing bus. We used Vesping Barcelona which was a quirky way to see the city. (See my other review) 

On the whole a great central hotel. It was about 36 Euro from the airport and 38 Euro on the return trip to the hotel. Both trips were no more than 20 minutes.

Myself and my wife stayed here for our tenth wedding anniversary and can highly recommend this hotel. We will be returning here one day!",5,2012,08,30
23,BAD,"Arriving I had to wait 15 min at reception just because nobody was there !! Shower has no hot water both eve and next morning and a very un pite receptionist call me in the room at 12.15 (check out time was 12.00) saying that I have to check out immediatly as they need the room . I travel in many 4 and 5 star hotels all over the world ( including NYC , Shanghai , Singapore , ecc ) and I know hotel rules but it is first time I am treated in this way with no flexibility at all on check out time . I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS HOTEL !",1,2012,08,27
23,Well situated design hotel,"The one thing that really strikes you about this hotel, apart from it having a 0.5 floor, will be that once you get to your room, you'll notice something strange. 

The bathroom has no walls. It is completely open plan.

My shower has 3 walls of floor to ceiling glass. Just think about that for a minute.

If you can get past that, it is a great hotel. It has a decent restaurant, a bar with award winning barmen and is well located. They have a roof terrace bar and pool, although the pool is not huge and the walls of it on two sides are of laminated glass.",4,2012,08,24
23,Ohla Tastic,"From the moment we entered, a glass of cava awaiting us with wonderful staff we enjoyed a  two night stay of luxury, even the daunting prospect of a shower mid room did not phase us. Ideally placed  for all sightseeing with a very helpful concierge desk. We had a three course tasting menu which again was a superb experience, a fish called dot and a baby goat! We have rarely eaten stranger (or tastier) things.The rooftop terrace was great, especially to chill out in the evening.",5,2012,08,20
23,Great City Hotel,"This is a verg good hotel, the service was faultless and the roof top pool was great for relaxing after a long day seeing the sights. The hotel is in a great location and I would definately stay here again the next time I visit Barcelona. I'd also highly recommend a cocktail in the groud floor bar.",4,2012,08,17
23,I think 4 star,"This was our first time to Barcelona so didn't know what to expect, Ohla Hotel really made our stay very nice. The location is great about a ten minute walk to La Rambla, and a lovely clothes shop straight across where I bought 3 dresses in the sale.  We had a standard room which was very spacious and fantastic shower, only downside to the room was there were no mirrors apart from the one in the bathroom, which is very dark because of the lighting so my advice is to take a small mirror to put your make up on. We also had a bottle of Cava delivered in a bucket of ice on the house one evening which was a nice touch.  Roof terrace was very nice great place to chill out and fantastic views over Barcelona.",4,2012,08,14
23,Great value and great location,"We stayed at Ohla Hotel for 5 days in August '12.  Our room was a junior suite which consisted of a king sized bed and a lounge area (not separate).  The bathroom was not separate either, although the toilet was.  Our room (306 on the 3rd floor) looked over the Via Laietana.  The floor to ceiling windows were fantastic and blocked out all the noise of the street, however we were not able to open them to get fresh air, and so relied on the air-con (it would have been too noisy with them open anyway).  The decor was very nice, modern and clean. The bed was quite firm (borderline hard) and the pillows (we tried a few different options as we were given a choice) were all very soft.  

We went to the breakfast each morning as it was included in the room rate, and it was great with a selection of pastries, bread/toast, fruit, cereals, yoghurt, etc....  You could also order from a limited menu from very small but nice dishes such as eggs, omlettes, etc.   The service at the breakfast restaurant was almost non-existent.  If you wanted anything you had to walk up to the waiters and ask them, as you would be waiting all day if you waited to be served.

We also went to the pool, which has great views but the pool itself is quite small and there isn't a lot of seating.  Having said that, we always found a seat. 

The hotel is very centrally located, we walked everywhere.  It is about 10 minutes to El Born area (great for Tapas bars) and about 10 mins to La Ramblas (which we didnt actually go to much other than to have a quick look) and right in the Barri Gotic which is great for browsing shops and tapas, etc.

Overall a great experience, however they could improve on their levels of service.",5,2012,08,11
23,Oh la la!,"This hotel was very central, hip and trendy in terms of furnishings, the showers were designed with a twist, not somewhere I would stay with my mother but to go with a husband or boyfriend or lover, would be fine if you get my drift!

The wine bar on the roof top was mainly decorative but not as functional as the bar on the main lobby level where Max the award winning bar tender was absolutely phenomenol with his concoctions - we would definitely go back to drink his libations anyday!",4,2012,08,09
23,My favourite,"Have been to Barcelona three times, stayed at 3 different hotels, this is my favourite. It has a nice roof terrasse with a good bar, rooftop view, good service, sundeck, pool and relax seats. It has cool rooms only its not for the shy since the shower has a see through glass to the bedroom. The breakfast was delightful and its even served with champagne, its not overly expencive and it has a good restaurant if you would like to eat a good meal. 

Its also in the middle of everything, has serviceminded staff and OK clean rooms even if they are not the biggest rooms in the world. The window in the room cannot open due to the safety regulations but I didnt go to Barcelona to look out the window, but to walk in nearby narrow streets, wander the La Rambla, go to the beach and go shopping. You can do everything in walking distance.",5,2012,08,07
23,Ohla 5* Hotel,"this hotel was really beautyfull. we choose a junior suite and also saw the standard rooms but there are small and the shower is in the middle of the room. There is no big difference between the price of the standard and the junior suite.. so, choose the junior suite.
The suite is modern and big but choose the high levels because of the noise of the street. the swimmingpool is small but made of glass (very smarth). The view on the terrasse is really wonderfull. the breakfast is good (fresh juices and croissants). We just noticed that in the evening some places on the terrasse are VIP booked (you must order champagne to sit there) and usually these are not clients of the hotel. we only had a trouble. we arrived at 10 am and the reception told us that the check-in is at 2pm. I sshow them the email i wrote about my arrival at 10 and ask them a room as fast as possible (because they didn't answer my email). we had to wait one hour to have the room.
otherwise we highly recommand this hotel.",5,2012,08,06
23,Ohla Hotel,"The location of the hotel was great. The room was great as well. It was all very clean and really a nice design hotel. I really enjoyed my stay.
The only thing that was quite annoying is that the hotel restaurant wasn't always open. They where closed in the middle of the day and at night.",4,2012,08,06
23,An absolute 'must' for a break in Barcelona!,"The Ohla is a great boutique hotel which is very well located.  The hotel itself is stylish, the rooms very modern and the fact that the bathroom was part of the bedroom gave the element of spaciousness. The staff are helpful, always eager to assist and recommended some fabulous restaurants.  The atmosphere of pool/rooftop is cool and tranquil - perfect for relaxing after a long day of sightseeeing.  Breakfast is great and the the food at Ohla gastrobar is scrumptious . Again, the restaurant staff are welcoming and helpful at all times.  I would definitely recommend the Ohla and would love to come back and stay again.",5,2012,08,06
23,"Everything was great...well could have been, but wasn't.","OK, I splashed out on an upgraded room, treated myself to a few indulgence packages and experienced the best a hotel could offer.  Unfortunately it came with some shoddy service.

We had high hopes as they chased us for confirmation of our choice of pillows and preferred times etc, but came away a little disappointed that the 5 stars didn't stretch to efficiency.

We were collected at the airport and driven in comfort to the hotel doorstep without a hitch, and moved quickly onto the the Reception upstairs, as the bellboy looked after our cases.

Unfortunately this is where the service began to deteriorate, as friendliness and smiles seemed to belong to an upgrade I didn't fork out for.  Not sure if it was because someone was getting trained, but one of the two people behind the desk stood the whole time and directed his seated colleague didn't even acknowledge us, and it felt more like an interrogation than a welcome.

Anyway; the room was fantastic.  Open planned bathroom, large shower, separate toilet, cleverly disguised behind a concealed door.  Apparently, reception has to fend of a number of calls from guests who cannot find it.  Clever lighting too, so people can *ahem* use the facilities in the middle of the night without lighting up the rest of the room as if warding ships away from the rocks.

The hotel's location cannot be beat, in my opinion, as it is on the edge of the Barcelona's gothic quarter, and yet close to the metro, and all things convenient.  Exploring Barce from this base was a most pleasant experience, as was getting back to the room on the first night to find a bottle of fizzy stuff chilling in a bucket of ice.  Perhaps this was because the pool area was to be closed off to the public the next day for some media/photo shoot thing, or perhaps this is standard policy.  I don't know, but it was a nice touch.  The pool area, by the way, is beautiful.

Our second indulgence was the degustation meal in the hotel's award winning restaurant.  It took them a little time to work out who we were and what we had pre-booked...but once that misunderstanding had been cleared up, this was perhaps the greatest meal we experienced during our 3 week vacation across Europe and Singapore.

I wouldn't hesitate to day trip to Barcelona from anywhere in Europe to eat there again.  And the service here, was fabulous.  Friendly, attentive and efficient.

Indulgence 3 was a disaster.  The ""Fall In Love"" package sold itself as a night in the Junior Suite (we were in it anyway), in room breakfast, a la carte bath-tub service, rose petals, bottle of cava, chocolates 'sins', and a late check-out.

And we booked it for 6pm

We got back to our suite for 6.05 expecting everything to be in place...but there was nothing.

A call down to Reception seemed to ring their memory bells...and up came a maid to run our bath and scatter rose petals.  However, its doesn't quite have the same effect when you watch them do it.

We then had to prompt them to bring the cava.

And then the chocolates, which looked like they had barely bothered to tip them out the packet.

Oh dear.

Breakfast in the room wasn't great either, but because we had an evening flight we appreciated the late check out.

Check was fun!  Our bill was either the work of Salvador Dali or Stephen Hawking.  If it was any more undecipherable we would have had to borrow the Enigma Machine.  It was also in essence wrong.  A re-work and it was still wrong, but this time in my favour.  The poor girl behind the counter was all over the place.  Nevertheless, we made it right, I'm still not sure how; I paid and went on my way.

Another (very) pleasant ride to the airport.  The driver was very happy to answer our Barce questions and point out sites we had missed (or misunderstood), and we said our goodbyes.

Somewhere between here and passport control, I lost my wallet, but that's another story.  The Ohla were very helpful in trying to (unsuccessfully) retrieve it, and I like to think is a metaphor for this hotel.  It strives, but it doesn't quite fulfil its promise.

I would stay here again though.",3,2012,08,06
23,Amazing Stay - Pure Luxury,"I really do not see what anyone could find to complain about this lovely hotel. The rooms are all very stylish, modern and luxurious. The hotel itself is beautiful, centerally located and staff can not do enough to help.
When looking around, I could not see another hotel within the city centre that even came close.
Food was fab, we stayed for 4 nights and were upgraded to a dome suite, I think this is a version of a jnr suite - it was just stunning.
Don't hesitate, just book it!!!",5,2012,08,02
23,Great welcome to Spain,"Our first night in Spain celebrating St.Joan at the Ohla. Drinks on the rooftop with a great view.
Yes reviewer ""noname36"" it isn't for kids - that's why we booked here - we also loved our junior suite, and had no probs at breakfast at all! We totally enjoyed our 5 nights here and would stay again when we come back to Barcelona.",5,2012,08,01
23,"Outstanding service, great location and cool place to stay!","We've just spent a fantastic couple of nights in Barcelona and were really pleased with our choice of the Ohla Hotel. Its location on the edge of Barri Gotic was perfect, close to the main event and a very short walk to the thick of it. We were immediately impressed with the reception we received and despite the Ohla being very 'cool' in design, the welcome was very warm. Our room wasn't ready as the previous occupants had refused to leave on time but we were offered two very cold glasses of Cava on the stunning roof terrace while we waited which definately made up for it.
The interiors are quite dark but overall we thought that the Junior Suite was fab, the bed was confortable and the shower heavenly. In fact the only issue was that it took us 10mins to work out where the toilet was located ( its virtually hidden behind a wall panel!) 
We had a drink on the terrace before we went out for dinner and I don't think we could have asked for a more perfect spot.
We enjoyed the breakfast and overall would definately stay here again..just loved the whole experience, thank you!",5,2012,07,29
23,Brilliant,"Super hotel, Great location centre of all you need to see in Barcelona modern hotel so clean we had a fantastic junior suite, great warm roof top pool and sun area, will return. A 5 star hotel, 5star staff and 5 star breakfasts and amazing cocktail bar one of the worlds top 50.",5,2012,07,27
23,Would not recommend,"Stayed in July.  Booked through a third party website and friends who booked directly with the hotel had much better luck with requests and free upgrades. Concierge made numerous mistakes and we had to re-book several different transfers/tours and on different days as the requests were not made.  Breakfast had slow service and when it was busy people were made to wait for a table as there was not enough room in the restaurant - also poor replenishment of food during service.  Roof top pool had terrible layout and was very small.  Adults suntanning were splashed by any movement in pool.  Those using pool could not enjoy without upsetting adults sunbathing.  Not a place for families.  Would definitely try another hotel.  Either pay more for a higher rated hotel (which is what I wish I had done) or if you cannot afford it, try another 4 star type hotel or go in with low expectations.  Junior suite was not spacious (only small armless loveseat in addition to the bed, regular rooms had more closet space than junior suite.  Elevators painfully slow to the point you will take stairs instead.  Only news channel in english I believe.  Not much to do if you plan to spend any time at the hotel.  Just a very disappointing experience definitely not worthy of 5 stars (perhaps not even 4).  One day we came back to our door left propped completely wide open by the cleaning staff after they had finished- thankfully nothing was missing.  Comedy of errors.  Wish I had better things to say...",2,2012,07,26
23,Neat place,"Interesting ""retro"" like place.  Great beds, great breakfast (ours was included) with glasses of Cava included, Juices,  orange, grapefruit, peach, pineapple. A small selection of hot food, one only per person, 5 fruits, 4 cheeses, 4 meats, breads pastries, coffees.  All good quality and fresh. It must have been a 20EU meal each.  Buffet sort of. Staff as friendly as they can be in Europe. Conceirge very good. Location close to everything possible walking wise.  If you wanted to walk to the beach it was a half hour but your on vacation! Shopping food and people galore everywhere close!!  Neat roof top pool good enough to cool down and relax and tan.  Not huge but good enough and with glass walls, city views. Don't make a splash there. Not a place for kids. The only problem we felt with the place was it needed more of an introduction to it's facilities, explanation of how lights worked, maybe a few more English TV channels not being the news.  Transit everywhere.",4,2012,07,24
23,"Lovely Room, Amazing Cocktails, Breakfast a Shambles","Really great location near a number of metro stations in the centre. Hotel was stunning. Room was perfect, really comfy bed, huge bathroom, sofa area. Used the rooftop pool. Pool probably stretching it - more a glass box of water on the rooftop - but amazing views and rarity to have any sort of pool in city centre in barcelona. Limited food menu at the rooftop pool (most of the items on the menu we were told we couldn't have). Had a couple of cocktails in the bar in the evening - defintiely recommend. Service great and cocktails out of this world. Unfortunately the last impression we had of the hotel was breakfast the next day. Served till 11 on sundays so we went down at 10.35. No tables available and were added to a waiting list. Got a table 10 mins later. Hardly any food of the buffet left unless you wanted bread or cakes. Fruit wasn't renewed, only one cereal left. Ordered pancakes from the hot menu. At about 5 past 11 a waitress came over and said they were clearing up in 5 mins. I said i hadn't had my breakfast order yet and she shrugged, pulled a 'thats tough' face and told me that they were clearing away regardless. At 11.20 I went and chased up my breakfast order which still hadn't appeared. % mins later a single cold pancake with a teaspoon of jam on it arrived - hardly worth waiting for. What made it worse was at the next table a couple had come in for brunch and were getting great service whilst we were being hurried out and ignored. Breakfast took away from what would otherwise have been a lovely stay",4,2012,07,17
23,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights in July for our silver wedding anniversary.  They kindly gave us an upgraded room which was beautiful.  Fabulous big bed, large freestanding bath and separate walk in shower.  Breakfast was excellent and really set us up for the day. Very good location and plenty of good restaurants.  Pool on the roof was an added bonus and great after long days walking around the city.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,07,09
23,"Excellent Hotel, Wonderful Staff","My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Ohla in June.  Hip, luxurious and friendly are the best words to describe the hotel.  It is centrally located to the old city, the central markets, Musee Picasso, etc.  The buffet breakfast is spectacular.  The Italian concierge was incredibly helpful (among other things, when I accidentally left the hotel without my jacket, he called the taxi company and got my jacket to me!).  Highly recommended.",5,2012,07,09
23,Food poisoning and attitude,"We were staying in this hotel with our parents and this is our opinion on the hotel.

First of all - the rooms are sooo small! They are all designed by a designer who thought that noone was going to live there. Our shower was made of glass and was right in the center of our room and water was constantly leaking so that the floor was always wet. I mean REALLY wet with 1sm of water.

Secondly - the view, more NO view at all. It's either your room is facing the street (it's more expensive and our parents booked it) and it is REALLY noisy, you can hear everything and it seems like the tram is riding in your room OR you can get a ""nice"" view on the other building.... There are a couple of rooms that face the corner of a street, but they are still very noisy.

The staff. OOOOH that was terrible! First of all we tried to change our rooms and we were told that they have no rooms available. We searched in front of a staff member booking.com and found out that there's plenty of free rooms. The manager somehow changed the rooms in the end. More on staff below.

The food. That's the WORST part. We were poisoned at a michelin star restaurant in this hotel. We all ate fish for the dinner and right after 6 hours (or 8) everyone was running to the toilet every 10 minutes. Two of us had fever. The manager refused to cooperate, refused to take any analysis of the food, refused us to call a doctor and offered ""her"" doctor, she even charged us for the water that we ordered through the day - we couldn't eat anything. We changed our flight tickets, because we couldn't stay at this hotel with the fever and noisy tram outside any longer.

The WORST experience so far.",1,2012,07,09
23,Ohla Hotel earns every one of its five stars,"The Ohla Hotel earned every one of its five stars during our stay in June in celebration of our anniversary.
Star One: We selected Ohla Hotel based on its ideal location. It's a short walk (5 - 15 minutes) to the places we wanted to visit: the Palau de la Musica, the Picasso Museum, the Miro Foundation Museum, the Barcelona Cathedral, some great restaurants, a colorful market, souvenir shopping, and other conveniences like ATMs and Hop-On/Hop-Off bus tours. It's an inexpensive taxi ride (six euros) to Sagrada Familia.
Star Two: Every staff member we encountered was responsive, helpful, and gracious. Everyone spoke English, so there was never a miscommunication. They were sincere in their desire to answer any question, take care of any request, and solve any problem. Check-in was a breeze, and reception made sure we got the room we had previously requested: a junior suite on the fifth floor.
Star Three: There's quite a contrast between the classic architecture of the exterior and the sleek, modern, and minimalist design features of the rooms. I loved the simple, uncluttered look of our junior suite. The bed was so very comfortable. We got to select in advance the type of bed linens, the style of pillows, and the delicate scent (of roses) we detected when we entered the room. The view was great, and there was no noise from the street.
Star Four: The daily breakfast in the GastroBar was a delight to the senses. There were several hot selections cooked to order and a huge selection of juices, pastries, and fresh fruit. The coffee was excellent. We enjoyed an unforgettable ten-course meal at the Ohla Hotel's Michelin Star Saüc Restaurant. Our waiter introduced each course and was attentive without being obtrusive.
Star Five: There were several occasions when staff members provided assistance beyond what was written in their job descriptions. Most notable was a recommendation for and help with the acquisition of tickets for perfect seats in the Palau de la Musica for a performance of Flamenco Y Opera. The Ohla Hotel manager helped us to celebrate our anniversary in some unanticipated ways.
We look forward to a future return to Barcelona, and we will definitely stay at the Ohla Hotel again.",5,2012,07,07
23,Excellent but...,"Excellent hotel, very nice place to stay, outstanding location, staff and service outstanding.

The ""BUT"" rrelates to the room picture vs the actual room.  The Design Deluxe is smaller than their website picture implies, creating a significant disappointment for my wife.  The lack of a bathtub also was disappointing.  The shower's location can also be a bit unnerving; it isin the middle of the room.

All that being said, we would stay there again, only in a larger room.",4,2012,07,07
23,Great Location and Fine Service,"We stayed at thi hotel last March, very close to it's original opening. The hotel is in a fine location for sighteeing, shopping, and a great lobby bar/fantastic drinks. Additionally, the head bartenders are vary personable and can provide great tips.  Service and the hotel was actually very good for a new hotel. Additionally, the concierge was great!  Our only issue was he cost of a driver for the day when including the hotel commission. You would do better getting this on your own.  However, the hotel was very good at fixing an issue we had with our driver when it came time to settle the bill.  Overall, you can not go wrong here!",4,2012,07,06
23,"5 star location, 4 star hotel","To be fair, if I could have, I would have rated the hotel 3.5 instead of 3. The location is fantastic, very central, close to shops, sights and the metro is across the street. But it's missing something. Tries too hard to be cool and 5 star, but sadly misses.  The set-up is a little strange: no lobby per se, just a concierge desk (with too many staff just standing around) and 2 chairs. The reception is on floor 0.5 and is basically a small desk. There is a small library/business centre with one loungey chair and a desk. Probably no surprise, but this strange set-up creates absolutely zero atmosphere. There is more going on at the roof terrace. Nice view, very small pool for a dip, loungers, lounge beds and a self serve bar. Pretty nice if you can find a place to sit. The ""gym"" is a few cardio machines and some free weights. The staff were mostly nice, except for a few of the guys at the concierge desk who seemed to have little interest in providing useful info. The standard room was on the small side and had a very open bathroom/shower area (best suited for couples who know each other well!). The shower was very good with strong water pressure. We asked for a quiet room and were given a corner one overlooking the side street and inner courtyard. Very quiet despite the fact that the ""balcony"" door didn't have a latch and didn't completely close. Bed was firm yet comfortable. The room was lacking amenities one would expect in  5 star, ie kettle, iron, and tissues. Very strange that the only tissues in the room were 4 small folded ones in a small cardboard box! Barcelona hotel prices aren't the cheapest, so I realize you don't always get a lot for your money. But you can definitely get better value than the Ohla.",3,2012,07,04
23,Nice boutique hotel,"This is a boutique hotel in the center of the city.Stayed there for 5 nights. The hotel was renovated and is very modern from the inside. It has a pool on the roof (glass sided) and overlooks the city. great relaxing point after all the sightseeing and the beach.

The hotel is walking distance from some of the key sightseeing destinations and la rambla.

The shower is exotic in the sense that it is in the middle of the room (glass sided and see through). Rooms were very clean and tidy.
Due to the size of the building and its age, there are only 2 elevators (pretty slow). It is faster to take the stairs.
I did not enjoy their breakfast, but my wife did. Anyway, there were tons of cafes right outside the hotel that you can have breakfast in.
Concierge was great. He took care of all our reservations, purchasing tickets and knowledge of the city.",4,2012,07,04
23,Great Hotel & Location,"Stayed 4 nights in a Junior Suite. Great price including breakfast via Hotels.Com. I have previously stayed at H1898 but it was full and I liked the look of this. I was not disappointed, although H18981 just pips it as my favourite, i would definately stay here again. Price was cheaper than 1898 and facilities were great. Location wise - this is better than 1898. Walking distance to beach/barri gottica/plaza catulunya/cathedral/shops etc. Whereas 1898 is right on Ramblas..it sometimes felt too frantic ..this is much more sedate feeling. Staff were excellent..concierge booked restaurant for me prior to my arrival..reception were accomodating and friendly. I got a late 5pm check out (for small charge) which was brilliant. room was ready before 2pm arrival too..so no complaint.
Junior Suite was lovely/spacious/sexy (open plan bathroom/bedroom).
Rooftop pool was great. Great views/drinks/staff. (see pics)
Definately reccomend this hotel.",4,2012,07,03
23,5 Star? .......OhLa Si and OhLa No,"We booked two rooms at this Hotel. Location is as good as it gets. You can walk to the port area, La Ramblas, and Gaudis Casa Batllo equally in around 15-20 minutes. There is a nearby metro station and plenty of public transport accessible on the street outside the hotel. There is also a Bank teller machine within 50 meters and a convenience shop around 200 meters away.

Shopping and dining options are abundant all around you.  

We had rooms on the 5th floor, with street views. Traffic noise from outside was not an issue, but Be aware that you will experience a dull rumbling noise every 90 seconds which we are guessing is coming from the underground metro system.

Room lighting is exceptional, which is a nice change from hotel lighting we have experienced elsewhere in Spain. The room itself is furnished in a minimalist contemporary style. The bed is a queen size , which to our way of thinking is not what we usually see in  a 5 star hotel.  

The room design makes a feature of a clear glass shower recess in the middle of the room.  If you have modesty issues, then this room would not be for you ( if your partner exited the room while you were showering, be advised that you would be on full view to anyone passing your room door). 
There is a separate toilet cubicle. In our room there was a fixed head shower outlet and a flexible hand held outlet. The fixed head in our room was faulty, dispensing water upwards as well as vertically downwards. If you wanted a quick rinse without getting your hair wet, wear a shower cap! The remaining bathroom wet area has a shallow hand basin with a ""mixer tap"". Be advised if you wanted to fill the basin, this design does not incorporate a plug. 

Window furnishings provide full blackout if you are catching up on sleep during daylight hours.

Wardrobe hanging space is ample, but the luggage stowage area is quite narrow and would not accommodate a larger suitcase. There is a minibar and security safe in the room.

Air conditioning is quiet and very efficient. Our rooms were fitted with Sound docks for Apple IPhone/IPod ( which doubled as battery rechargers). A Samsung flat screen TV had plenty of viewing options. We looked around for a hotel service guide and could not find one. There is a separate room service menu. If you are a user of in-house hotel telephone systems then bring a Cisco IP telephone system guide with you!

On our multiday stay, we had breakfast in the restaurant on street level. The menu offering was not what I would describe as ""international"", but OK for our needs.

The concierge service is friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable. 

And now for the Yin and the Yang.  If you stay at this hotel, the cocktail bar area is a treat. Beautiful ambience and the staff are ""poetry in motion "".  Our party of three ordered 2 house specialty cocktails and a Bloody Mary, which arrived promptly. The tab was €33 and we were well satisfied.  On the other hand, we attended the roof top pool area for an evening ""sundowner"".  At the time the area was staffed by two persons and there were 6 other clients in attendance to enjoy a breathtaking view. We ordered one specialty cocktail, a champagne cocktail and a Bloody Mary.  Our drink arrived after a waiting period of 30 minutes.  To add to our disappointment, the drink quality was inversely proportional to the bill, which came to €45. ( I am convinced that the Bloody Mary was pure tomato juice)........

Room amenities.  FYI. We received complimentary bottled water on day one, which was not replaced. 

I like to be forensic in my hotel reviews. You can decide what is or is not important to you.  I like the location,  but next time I probably will look elsewhere.",3,2012,07,02
23,Our  day in Barcelona 2012,"This was our second  tri[p to Barcelona. The first was so memeorable we just had to  come back. We stayed in a beautiful  5* hotel the  last time but after reading the  reviews about your hotel, I decided to cancel our other hotel and book at the Ahla.  This was the best thing we could  have done. The hotel was amazing....the  decor, the  upkeep,  the friendlieness of the staff, the location,  There was nothing  that was not perfect. I would recommend this hotel to  anyone who is going to Barcelona.  We are so happy we made the decision to leave the Majestic and try The Ahla.",5,2012,07,02
23,5* - debatable,"Hotel is in a good location within easy walking distance (in my opinion) of the marina, Las Ramblas, shops, cathedral etc..  However I have stayed in 5* hotels before and this one doesn't quite match up.  
We had a block booking of 7 rooms for a hen weekend but beware if you do this as we had loads of stuff on our room which we didn't actually have.  For some reason we were twinned with one of the other rooms in the party even though we didn't check in with them as they went the day before us. 
We had complimentary water in the room, but only on arrival.  For 5* I would have expected that every day.  Every time we showered the whole bathroom area was covered in water (no - it was not a wet room!).  That went into the toilet and our room!!  Others in our party experienced the same thing.  Lack of a mirror in the bedroom was frustrating.
Breakfast was really good, plenty to choose from.  Didn't eat in the restaurant apart from that.
Beds were really comfy.
If I could find another hotel in the same location with a rooftop pool, I wouldn't go back.  If not I would visit again but only on a special offer deal and purely because of the location and the pool.",3,2012,06,25
23,An amazing hotel in a fabulous location,"We visited the Hotel Ohla in May this year and had the most pleasurable stay. The GastroBar and cocktail bar was fantastic, the rooms luxurious and the staff very personable. The hotel is perfectly positioned for exploring Barcelona and yet very peaceful given you are fairly central. We stayed on the 6th floor and had fantastic views from our room. The swimming pool on the roof and views across Barcelona are awesome on a clear day. We would recommend this hotel and look forward to returning soon.",5,2012,06,16
23,Go for the cocktails!,"We didn't actually stay at the hotel but we ate in both the main restaurant Sauc (with one Michelin star), had tapas in the brasserie and visited the cocktail bar every night.

The cocktail bar was amazing, in some ways it's probably good that we didn't actually stay at the hotel otherwise we never would have left! The barmen Massimo and Guiseppe were both charming and fascinating to watch and they had an excellent selection of classic and more  unusual cocktails (including some specially designed for and at the hotel) in very chilled out surroundings. The food in the main restaurant was delicious although the portion sizes on the tasting menu were a little on the large size given the number of courses, and the tapas in the brasserie was tasty.  If you are coming to Barcelona but can't quite stretch to the cost of a room, just come for the food and drink, you will not be disappointed.",4,2012,06,16
23,Good but not Great,"I had high hopes for Ohla after a great write up in the NY Times.   While it is listed as a 5 star hotel it just isn't a true 5 star place.   Too many small things that add up leaving you with this feeling while a great place it just isn't a ""5"" - like sitting on the roof top bar at 8:00 p.m. enjoying the great weather to be told ""we're closing now"";  having a toilet that runs and runs and you need punch the wall to stop it; talking to a conceirge who doesn't really speak english and has no  suggestions for a dinner spot beyond the retaurant in the hotel; or a shower that while cool leaks and leaves the bathroom floor super wet.

The issues we had can be fixed quite easily but just not sure the hotel is able/keen to step it up - when three couples ask ""why are you shutting down the bar now - it is so early and nice out"" and the answer is ""because this time of year isn't supposed to be this nice"" there seems to be some major rethinking needed from the top down.   The rooms are large, the windows big, location great, the style of the place very cool, lobby bar serves great drinks and the restaurant makes some amazing dishes so there is reason to fix these little things and make Ohla a top spot in town.

Close but not close enough to warrant a 5 star rating......3.5 stars is my vote (but easy for them to get to 4!)",3,2012,06,12
23,There are better 5 Star Hotels in Barcelona,"When we arrived, we were taken to a room that was in the room category we booked but it had a terrible view of the back of a building.  I asked to be moved but nothing else was available except upgrades.  I was very disappointed with the view.  If you stay here, I would not recommend booking the standard room.  The shower is ridiculous...it leaks all over the bathroom floor.  It is beautiful, just not functional.  The room itself is spacious and the furnishings and finishes are sparse but very nice.  The  breakfast that was included with our room was horrible.  There was nothing really available to eat and the dishes that we ordered were not good at all...runny eggs, cardboard pancakes, and the pastries tasted like they were stale.  The service in the restaurant at breakfast is not good.  You have to track down a waitress to take your order...same with the bar on the rooftop.  There is only one person working each place, it is hard to get service.  The front of the outside of the hotel is beautiful.  It definitley has curb appeal and the entrance and common areas are well done.  I think if you stayed in a suite or some other more expensive room, the room experience would be better but the service at the bar and restaurant wouldn't change.  If you are looking for a true five star hotel; I saw others that would probably be a better fit for you.  I think this is on the low end of the five star range.",3,2012,06,08
23,Great Hotel. Exceptional service.,"This hotel is well situated and within easy walking distance to the old city and La Ramblas.
We had a junior suite ,which was superb. Excellent and comfortable beds. Concierge/ front desk man and his staff were extremely helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. Downstairs restaurant food was excellent and well priced. Roof terrace and pool great.",5,2012,06,08
23,Good for me,"Arrived Sunday 3rd June for 3 nights. Check in was a pleasure, It was more personal than your ordinary hotel, when you arrive at the concierge you are then taken to a private foyer where you do the check-in process. 

We booked s suite and the room was immaculate and very spacious, could not fault anything there, room was well cleaned and again a towel change and quick tidy in the evening was nice to come back too.

We dined at the Sauc restaurant, you would as his had a Michelin star but it really wasn’t to our taste, me and my wife enjoy our food. My wife commented about her main course that if she chose this of a buffet menu she would simply leave it on the side of the plate and get something else.

Staff were very polite and helpful cant really comment on the facilities of the hotel apart from the Sauc restaurant as I just did not have enough hours in the day.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again however I would probably just book a standard room as there is so much to do in Barcelona and there is so little time spent in the room.",5,2012,06,08
23,It's trying too hard....,"Whilst the hotel excels in some areas it fails badly in others. The staff at the rooftop bar and in the breakfast bar are particularly poor, the swimming pool needs a good clean and/or re-paint, minimalism to the point where it takes you ten minutes to find the toilet in your room is perhaps too much especially when that area is not to the standard of the rest of the room, fresh water not being put on the tables during meeting breaks, choice of food at breakfast and so on. On the other hand, the concierge and check-in staff are lovely, the food was great (if a little posh for me), the location seemed good and the rooms were well appointed, quiet (even at the front), reasonably sized (for a big city) and the bed was very comfortable with a great choice of pillows!! 

I was here on a business trip but if I was in the city on holiday I must admit I would be tempted to look elsewhere before choosing to stay at the Ohla.  I have stayed in much better hotels which may only be three or four star but which don't try to be something they are not. If you want to be exclusive then provide the service to match.",3,2012,06,06
23,Made a weekend special,"We stayed for 4 nights in April for my wifes birthday. Room was minimalist but everything was there...once you discovered how to open the doors! Breakfast in the hotel was fantastic with a superb choice and even better view of the street passing by. One night we dined in the Sauc restaurant, and whilst it was nice, it didnt really live up to a Michelin starred experience. Staff were helpful, but beware if you ask them to organise an airport transfer for you, ours got cocked up on both parts of the journey, which is inexcusable for a 5* hotel. Great location and makes it easy to see the sights form a reasonable central base",4,2012,06,04
23,Great location,"We stayed here when visiting Barcelona during F1 Grand Prix weekend so paid a fairly high price.  After a fairly lengthy check in process, we were shown to our room which was on the first floor.  It was spacious and clean, high-design and faced onto a pedestrian area.  It was a little noisy (another couple were in reception looking for a room move due to noise) but not excessively so.  The pool area (rooftop) was fine, though a little strange to have a see through side to the swimming pool... Like a human aquarium! Breakfast was very nice, with limited choice but good products. Why not freshly squeezed orange juice.. In Spain for chrissakes! (personal pet hate). Had a couple of drinks in the much vaunted bar...around 34 euros for two drinks!

Overall, a good, if not great, hotel in a great location.",4,2012,06,03
23,Ohla Hotel was excellent,"The Ohla Hotel was a highlight of our stay in Barcelona.  Superb service, they always wanted to do more for us.  The included breakfast could serve the most discriminating palate!  We left breakfast fully stuffed.  We stayed one night before we left on a cruse, then returned for 3 more nights.  Location was excellent.  Walking distance to most areas.  Near the Rambla but just far enough away for peace and quiet.  I had an instance of almost being pick pocketed as I was entering the hotel's from door but they failed.  keep your fanny pack in the front....  Should we return to Barcelona we will surely give Ohla high consideration.  Across the street is the business location for Barcelona Guide Bureau for sightseeing in and around town.  Climbed the three stories to make our reservations for Montserrat and the Highlights tours.  Very satisfied with the company, the quality of the guides and the quality of the buses.  Some travelers booked their tours on line.   You can't go wrong with either of these recommendations.  The rooftop lounge was nice but we didn't have time to fully enjoy it.",5,2012,05,28
23,Great hotel and outstanding service - for the most part,"We just spent 5 wonderful nights at the Ohla and are alsready looking forward to going back. The rooms are very modern and quiet...and the service for the most part is excellent. We had a little misadventure at the Ohla Gastronomic Bar (where the food is amongst the best we had in the city) but on complaining to the hotel's general manager, Anna Albuixech, were treated to a very fine meal on one of the following nights. Another individual who provided us with 6 star service is Albert at the Concierge desk - he is bar none the best I have come across anywhere in the world.

The only downside to an otherwise very pleasant stay is that we did not find the service staff at breakfast to be particularly friendly...the hostess and servers didn't smile much..nor did they come up to us to take our made to order eggs. We had to flag them down as they rushed past our table and even when they did come up to our table, they gave us the impression that they were doing us a big favor! So all in all, if we overlook the service hiccups at the Gastronomic Bar, we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2012,05,25
23,Restaurant/Bar,We did not stay at this hotel but had a late night meal here and it was the best of all 5 nights in Barcelona. The waiter was the most friendly and helpful one we found in the city. He added to the already great meal the 4 of us had. One person had the hamburger and it was outstanding. Another had a beef sandwich which was excellent. My daughter ordered the fresh fruit and the presentation alone was worth it. Delicious and highly recommend.,5,2012,05,20
23,Very stylish hotel in fantastic location,"This was our second trip to Barcelona having previously stayed at the grand hotel central on our previous visit. Naturally we compared the two and my husband preferred GHC whilst I preferred Ohla. As others have commented the hotel is ideally situated on a nice road in Barcelona ( we aren't keen on the tourist trap that is las ramblas) we were greeted by the concierge and taken upstairs to the reception for a somewhat lengthy check in process! Our room was great, just a delux double so a lower grade of room but it was perfect for what we wanted and on the 6th floor so we didn't hear any road noise. We were also just 2 floors down from the fantastic roof top terrace and pool which was much appreciated in the 28 degree heat! Rooms were very clean and bright in side, very cool shower in the middle of the room. There are definitely areas that require improvement however, service really does leave a lot to be desired! It was difficult to attract the attention of a member of staff at breakfast to place an order and the concierge was permanently on the phone or busy when we wanted advice! I gave in and went to reception to ask but they were not willing to help with restaurant reservations etc! Also the pool on the roof top is a huge selling point but we were disappointed to find that the bar closes at 6pm therefore no option to have a drink outside in the evening! This is something that we loved about the grand hotel central. 
Overall I would say that the the positives certainly outweigh the negatives of this hotel and we will most likely be back!

On another note, we witnessed an incidence of pick pocketing whilst in the city, I was aware that this happens quite regularly and didn't carry a bag with me! Keep your wits about you and
Watch your valuables whilst out on the streets 

",4,2012,05,19
23,Pretty good..............,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in April. We chose it primarily because of its central location and were not disappointed at all - close to major sites and shopping centres, easy access to public transport, plenty of nice restaurants and tapas bars nearby, not too busy or noisy - request a room on a higher floor (eg 4th floor and above) and facing the back. Staff were friendly and willing to assist especially with suggestions for meals and tourist sites. The room was fairly standard for the amount that we paid - clean, comfy bed, decent TV, ok size and well appointed room. Only snag was the shower cabinet - it leaked water to the outside floor. Be mindful that it's an open-concept shower ie free-show for all, just glass....there are rooms with standard type shower for more privacy which can be requested in advance.  
Breakfast was included in the cost; however...while there was a large spread of continental breakfast, the hot breakfast items were ala-carte and you could only chose one item from a smal selection. Not that we ate much but for the price we paid, we expected better value. Otherwise it was a decent place to stay.",4,2012,05,18
23,Honest,"We'd staied for one day, and all at this hotel was very good. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Very modern, the bathroom is cool, and the amenities are very good.
Staff is very attentive and kind. The breakfast is agreeable. 
For me this hotel is honest, and reasonable price.",4,2012,05,06
23,"Centrally-located, great staff, amazing shower","My husband and I just spent three weeks in Europe, and Barcelona was definitely a highlight as we enjoyed the lovely architecture and quaint streets of the city.  We were equally as pleased by the beauty, style and location of this classy hotel. Lots of special touches in this hotel.  In fact, the staff emailed us in advance about or preference of pillows and sheets.  We loved the staff, especially Michael and Albert, who helped us find our way to an ATM, suggested great restaurants, booked our museum tickets and even told us how to get to the grocery store -- all with a smile and eagerness to help. The women who cleaned the room was very friendly and did an amazing job. The room alone was a piece of art with the elegant glass-enclosed shower separating the bedroom from the bathroom.  And a great shower it was! The tapas at the restaurant were elegantly prepared and I could have lived on the bread alone. Only one suggestion -- more lighting is needed down the stairs to the restrooms on the bottom floor.  Even with that, it was an easy 5 for us!",5,2012,05,05
23,Not Really 5*,"We booked this hotel via Mr & Mrs Smith as we were looking for a quality hotel in a good location to celebrate our wedding anniversary.You have to say that the hotel is centrally located but it is right on a busy road so traffic noise is high. The service is slick and helpful.
The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Cathedral the surrounding area itself is a mixture of shops and restaurants some of which have seen better days or are closed hence the odd tramp sleeping in the doorway. 
We never ate in the restaurant save for breakfast which was reasonable as the cooked food was only warm at best.
The rooms are high quality but due to its location the windows do not open hence you have to rely on the air conditionings for fresh air which is difficult to control in respect of temperature.
The roof top terrace is a great place to relax, get a great view of the city or take a dip. The let down was that the bar was always closed and hence no food or drink available.",4,2012,04,28
23,Absolute Blissful Chic !,"I decided to book this hotel after some extensive research to celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary.  As it was the first time that my wife and I had travelled without our two boys in a while I had some strict criteria on making this memorable.  Well I can say that Ohla did not disappoint !!!

From the moment we arrived through the grand entrance we knew this was a special place.  As you enter you are enveloped in a dark black chic hallway with the concierge desk to your right.  There we were greeted by Fausto (according to my wife, a lush Italian).  He was so helpful in settling us and led us to the small annex on the first floor where we checked in.  The check in  almost like a cool living room.  Ultra smart white furnishings and homely book cases all around.  My wife and I spoke in hushed tones as we really did feel like we were in someones home - very nice.

I managed to get an early spring (March) deal on a junior suite.  What an absolute treat !  Took the advice of others on TA and had a 5 floor suite overlooking the main street.  The room was quite excellent with the same chic design and modern feel.  The bathroom was a little confusing at first as it is actually in your room.  Think of an open plan kitchen with dinning, instead you have an open plan bathroom with a bedroom.  This makes the room very intimate for couples, but if you are planning on sharing with someone you don't know very well - perhaps this open plan design isn't a great idea - no bathroom door as such in other words !!  There is of course a discrete loo so it's not all open plan.  

The bed was firm and comfortable and you can actually pick the scent of the pillows - very classy touch.  We were greeted with a bottle of bubbly cava for our anniversary and our arrival was complete - fantastic start. 

We chose to eat in the adjoining Sauc Michelin starred restaurant.  The restaurant is very small and off an annex by the reception room.  You cross a little bridge over the main lobby and bar area - smart.  My wife and I chose the 5 course tasting menu, as my wife doesn't eat meat the restaurant amended the tasting menu to be more seafood based.  Cannot fault the service or the food, simply lush.  I would say that you'll need to have an adventurous palette to enjoy the experience - not a burgers and chips place - and not ideal for children.  

Breakfast was in the brasserie area with a nice open selection.  Plenty of cold and warm options.  I chose a small cooked Sausages and Eggs breakfast - but I've never seen such a classy serving of the dish - again the word I'd use is Chic !!!

The hotel is located right in the centre of old Barcelona - we were a 5 min walk from La Ramblas, 5 minute walk from Barcelona Cathedral and a 45 second walk from the tube station that is opposite!  Because it was so close to the sights and transport, we were able to taste the best of everything in Barcelona without feeling rushed, no hassle of delays from cabs or traffic.  We chose to use the underground as it was cheap and very convenient.  I bought my wife and I a pair of traveller tickets for 2 days, about €29 - fantastic value.

Overall I could not have wished for a better experience.  Fabulous hotel that made the whole Barcelona experience unforgettable.  Well done Ohla and the team - truly fantastic !!",5,2012,04,22
23,Good but not great Central Hotel Experience,"This hotel is a class act - but it could do better. Its right in the middle of things and you never have to walk far to the best attractions. We didn't check out the Michelin star restaurant but dined on our first night in the casual restaurant which was a most pleasant experience. The Lady who acted as Maitre D was a superb polished act. The glass sided pool on the chill out roof terrace is nice but diminutive.Our room was good but not great. cosmetic products were not what you would like to expect from a hotel of this calibre. Breakfast again was good but not great. They produced croissants etc that to me had come straight from the freezer via the oven and were tasteless and tiny. in my book Spain produces great bread and pastry products - second only to France. it is not too big an ask to produce fresh products ! With a little extra effort this could be a great hotel. the design is fantastic, location superb, staff faultless but it is let down by the little things that were not just quite right.",5,2012,04,21
23,Nice Hotel but not Fantastic,The hotel is well located but in a too noisy area and quite dirty. This is not a 5 star hotl but a 4 star to my opinion. The matress was much too hard and the rooms are too hot or too cold if you put the air con. The service depends on the people who helps you it can be really good or really cold and not friendly. I was really dispointed by this hotel and it did not make me want to come back to BCN which is a very agressive city. Please be friendly if you want people to visit your city and boost your economy!!!!,3,2012,04,18
23,Absolutely fantastic stay,"We chose the Ohla Hotel for our honeymoon in part because of the reviews on here and we definitely weren't disappointed.

They arranged for a car to pick us up from the airport and on arrival we were quickly shown to seats and given a glass of cava to enjoy whilst we were efficiently checked in. We'd chosen a junior suite and the fall in love package for our first night and wow - to find red rose petals in a heart on the bed, a rose petal arrow leading to the bath, which had candlelight and rose petals in the hot, bubbly bath water. A chilled bottle of cava on the side with chocolate truffles... welcome to Ohla - we were in heaven!

We ate breakfast in our room every morning and although the room service charges were steep we found the breakfast filling and everything was well presented and cooked. 
The receptionist/concierge were also incredibly helpful booking restaurants for us (recommending great restaurants too!) and arranging taxis. Nothing was too much trouble and they were always delighted to be able to help.
Each evening when we were in, a lady came to our room to check the service/cleanliness of our room was satisfactory and to provide chocolates for our pillows - I truly think it's these little touches which made our stay extra special.

The final thing I should mention is the bar staff in the hotel - they are superb and I'd recommend popping in just for one of their amazing cocktails! Not only  are they incredibly knowledgable about the drink industry but nothing is too much trouble and they take the time to talk to all guests and will make any drink you ask, even if you just say I'd like something involving whisky.

Would absolutely recommend this hotel, and the area feels safe and is perfect walking distance to many great places including shopping and is a stones throw away from the metro for easy travel around Barcelona.",5,2012,04,16
23,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"Great location,great service and great breakfast.Albert the concierge was very helpful.
Showers are clear glass enclosures in the middle of the room,so keep that in mind.",5,2012,04,13
23,Stay was ok - but not worth the money,"My husband and I were excited to stay at the Ohla Hotel but in the end we were not impressed. The location is excellent but in our opinion that is the only five star aspect of this hotel. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, the woman checking in the guest before us was snapping at her because the guest was asking for her beds to be arranged in a different way (the way she had requested). When it was our time to check-in we were barely greeted. We had reserved a junior suite for four nights. They only had us down for two nights and when I mentioned this the check-in woman demanded to see our reservation. We were given a room on the 3rd floor - which turned out - allowed for a significant amount of street noise at night when we were trying to sleep. The room was fine, but quite small for a ""suite"" even by European standards.  In fact I feel that calling this room a suite is simply clever marketing tool. The room was just a room. I also noticed the same stale smell others have remarked on when we entered the room. The hotel had also sent us an email asking us what aromatherapy scent and pillow type we wanted upon check-in. Neither were present in our room. The bathroom was big but very dark. Maybe my eyesight is bad but I am not sure how you are supposed to apply make-up in a place that dark. The best light was in the closet with the toilet in it! I will say the shower was nice and free toiletries were good. Our breakfast experience was similar to others who posted reviews previously. The staff was really unhappy and they seemed quite put-off if you requested something cooked off the menu even though that was included. On our last morning for breakfast I had ordered scrambled eggs for myself with bacon and pancakes for my husband. My husband's pancakes came out and my eggs at least 10 minutes later with uncooked bacon. What a disappointment. This hotel is fine but it is not worth the money and the staff especially are not representative of someplace that claims to be five-star.",3,2012,04,12
23,Nice Hotel  (but not a 5*) - well placed disapointing restaurant,"Very Nice boutique style hotel, well situated in the Middle of Barcelona near to all the shopping and Museums. For the price you pay you would expect a little better service. arrived at the hotel just after midday room not ready ok that life, bot no offer of a coffee or drink while I had to wait.. asked for a room with a large bed (Big boy) got one with 2 singles....
Not 5* style
Very nice modern rooms, but you cannot open the windows, ok you do have A/C in the rooms.
iT IS NICE TO TURN OFF THE a/c and have the window open.... The bathroom system is great wit a large  shower in the middle of the room great.... really thought it was fun. 
Well equiped with aminaties and free wifi good connection.

One of the reasons that I picked the hotel was that it has 1 Michelin star restaurant....I think the inspectors should go back..... The food was ok when you got served and they did not forget what you orderd..... service was realy bad more or less had to beg to be served..

Nice wine list and Menu but the service does not follow a pitty

Breakfast was very good, Nice selection and served late.

In Barecelona thesr is better for less.",4,2012,04,11
23,Fantastic restaurant and bar,"We didn't stay here but had one of our standout meals of a trip here in the gastronomy bar. The tapas are heavenly; modern, fresh and very tasty. The orange curd and hibiscus pudding was out of this world! Staff are very friendly and helpful in explaining the unusual options, which sit alongside some more traditional dishes. So good we almost went back for a second dinner, in a city where there are many great options.",5,2012,04,11
23,Great for Couples,"My husband and I stayed here on a mini vacation and decided to splurge a little. My only ""complaint"" was the price but I've learned european hotels get the best of your wallet.  We stayed in a ""design"" (standard room) and loved the bathroom concept.  It's an easy way for the Hotel to save space but it also something new than the standard hotel (if you don't mind the lack of privacy).  The glass is not frosted so ask if you have kids staying with you (I've seen this concept at others where you can turn on the privacy glass - which was not an option in our room).  We had plenty of room for 2 including all our luggage.  Breakfast was great too and the locaiton is fabulous...hence the price.  The night before our departure I blew a fuse out in the room not once but twice.  And the seond time affected the entire floor.  Blame it on those converters!  The staff were great and quickly scrambled to fix it so we could get a few hours sleep  before our morning flight back to the US.  Their patience was much appreciated.  The hairdryer didn't survive!",5,2012,04,06
23,So near but yet so far.....,"The Ohla has the potential to be the best hotel in Barcelona, but there are a few gripes that let it fall below the 5* standard. 

On the plus side; the concierge were brilliant, and gave us a free bottle of Cava when they noticed it was my partner's 30th birthday. Also, the pool terrace area is stunning on a sunny day.

However, there are a couple of issues which take the shine off what could be an excellent hotel; firstly, and most importantly, do not let the hotel book you a cab to the airport! This is a real blight on the reputation of the hotel, as the cost of the cab was more than double if we had hailed it ourselves from the street. We did not have enough cash on us, and the terminal had no cash machines, so we ended up having to pay in sterling as it was the only cash left on us. This was very embarrassing, and could have been altogether avoided if the hotel had been transparent about the ludicrous pricing scheme. The cabbie told us that it was because the hotel charges special rates for cabs on a Sunday, but this does not justify a 150% mark up!!!

Also, our room has a stale smell which I can only put down to the shower in the middle of the room, but the windows would not open and no fresh air could clear away the smell of damp.

Ohla hotel takes itself extremely seriously, and has a very austere atmosphere, but gravitas must be earned, and the hotel has definitely not reached 5* potential.",3,2012,04,04
23,Not a 5 star hotel,"There is nothing fudamentally wrong with this hotel, but it just lacks any vibrancy or character. It takes itself too seriously and needs to seriously up it's game on the service front to truly be a 5 star hotel. Breakfast choice was poor and the location where breakfast is provided is very quiet - like having breakfast in a library (v. odd) Stayed in a junior suite and again nothing particularly wrong with it, but lacks the WOW factor - have stayed in better 4 star hotels than this. Commercially the staff are missing a trick when it comes to looking after guests and anticipating guest requirements, so they should work on this. I did enjoy the stay, but wouldn't stay again. Stayed for 4 days which was a gift from a family member, but if I had paid my own money I would have been seriously hacked off becuase it just wasn't worth it in the value for money stakes.",3,2012,03,30
23,Nice Location nice price,"When i book my Barcelona trip the Hotel was 2 months old, and it was brand new.I was there with my wife.The room that i stayed was normal small room, anywhere you go in europe rooms are small except than the 5 stay 500 euro per night hotels. 

The hotel location is great its the 2 parallel street from famous La Rambla, and one parallel street is great for shoppers.If you follow the main street to shout  where the hotel is you can access the port in 15-20 mins walk

Also hotel has a great boutique bar, one of the most talent bartenders in spain.Best cocktails and best presentation for the cocktail.

I recommend the bar more than the hotel.But hotel by himself clean new and nice.
Take advices from bartenders not from consierge, all the restaurants they suggested sucks",4,2012,03,27
23,Very Good Hotel in Barcelona,"Very good hotel in Barcelona. Clean, fresh, nice room, and very good service. The location of the hotel in center of Barcelona is perfect. I will try to book this hotel again next time I go to Barcelona. The only negative was the taxi the hotel booked for us. It was expensive and we could not pay with VISA-card so it's much better to stop a taxi on the street!!!",4,2012,03,26
23,Excellent Hotel,"In contrast to the exterior the hotel inside is very modern and stylish in a very minimalistic way. The staff is always helpful and even though a mixup with our room lead to us receiving a smaller room during our first night - we arived around midnight - they discovered their mistake and took action immediately. Aside from the apology we were granted the lower room rate for all days. 

The bed was excellent with a variety of choices for pillows. All rooms have an iPhone - soundsystem and free wifi.

The bar in the hotel is excellent with two bartenders making an art out of cocktails.

Breakfast is also very nice.

I can only recommend this hotel and will return for sure.",5,2012,03,21
23,5* Service and Quality,"Check in and check out was a bit weird and long winded but the customer service was excellent and the rooms were perfect.  Excellent quality with all the fixtures and fittings, very comfy bed and ideal location for Camp Nou, attractions and the Port.",5,2012,03,19
23,Perfect location - could do better,"I stayed with a friend for a weekend for my 40th birthday.  The location is perfect.  We were up-graded to the Junior Suite.  The room is very contemporary as is the bathroom.  However, there was no bath, only a rainfall-shower.  The bathroom steams up very quickly if you are showering for anything longer than a quick shower and go.  The mirrors are not steam-free.  There is no other mirror in the main room at all.  There didn't seem to be many channels on the tv, one or two british speaking channels.  There is no tea and coffee facilities, you have to request these together with the fact that there are no ironing facilities in the room, which for a 5-star hotel I find surprising.  The roof top pool area is lovely, although fairly small for a large hotel.  They did organise a 'surprise' for my birthday which turned out only to be a bottle of wine - which unfortunately I don't drink.  The breakfast is also a little disappointing for a 5-star hotel.  We felt that we 'inconvenienced' the waiting staff for asking for something cooked.  There is an internet facility which is by way of a notebook by the reception area. For the price and service, I would consider looking at other hotels in the area.",3,2012,03,17
23,Full of style.. Exquisite taste..,"Stayed in junior suite. Spacious, great layout, simple and not over pretentious. Concierge was very helpful. Suggested few great restaurants nearby. Lovely experience. Location couldn't be better. 5 mins to la ramblas and plaza catalunya yet still located in quieter area of town. Enjoyed my stay.. Simple stylish vacation..!",5,2012,03,14
23,"Fantastic hotel, excellent location","We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Ohla Hotel and found it to be a wonderful Hotel in an excellent location. Walking distance from the Aerobus which drops off at Placa Catalunya. ALL the staff were very helpful and friendly and not at all stuffy as we expected from a 5 Star Hotel. The AirCon failed on the 5th floor on day 2 and we were moved, and upgraded, to another room within 20 minutes. The highlight of the Hotel for us was the food. We ate at their Bar Gastronomique which served delicious and reasonably priced Tapas style food AND at their Sauc Restaurant where we had their Taster Menu which was FANTASTIC. The roof terrace is amazing, and if the sun is shining an amazing place to chill. The Cocktail Bar is also an unmissable experience. We cannot recommend the Hotel enough. FABULOUS!!",5,2012,03,12
23,Design and substance,"Ohla is a relative newcomer to Barcelona and it's easy to think that the last thing the city needs is another design over substance hotel.  However, this one  seems to have most things sussed and I won't be looking any further on my next visit.
We picked a design deluxe room, and were very happy with the size and amenities.  Everything you'd expect from a 5 star design hotel was present - ipod docks, check; free wifi, check; shower in the middle of the room; check.    The only mildly irritating point was the poor performance of the hairdryer but hopefully that was just our room - and was reported.
Breakfast was very well organised and had a good selection with a hot menu of items cooked to order.  
The restaurant in the evening was buzzy and offered an interesting selection of food and it's open on a Sunday evening, something of a minor miracle.
The concierge staff were very helpful and keen to offer recommendations and when we arrived from the airport, they welcomed us by name.  Clearly we were the last people that night to be arriving, but it was a very nice touch.
A great addition to the Barcelona scene.",5,2012,03,06
23,Good Gastronomie Bar,"We wanted to find a place to entertain friend and clients on Sunday evening.  Anyone who has been to Barcelona would know the challenge of finding a restaurant that opens on Sunday evening in Barcelona.  After a lot of internet searching we came across reviews about the bar at the Ohla hotel.  Apart from drinks, it serves good food too.  The atmosphere there was nice.  The bar is quite spacious with tables along the wall to seat groups of 4 - 6 people.  I am glad we found a nice bar with good food.",4,2012,03,04
23,Great design. Great location. Very pleasant stay.,"We spent 3 nights in a design room on the 5th floor. The room was very clean and comfortable, and just far enough from the noise on the busy street below. The location of the hotel is excellent - right across the street from a metro stop, and just a short walk away from a stylish neighborhood with many restaurants and cute shops. The cocktail bar on the ground floor was a little expensive but definitely worth it (try the boutique martini).",5,2012,02,21
23,everything perfect but...,"Everything was excellent, specially all the people in the reception were really polite, helpful and always with a smile. the only thing is that the service on the 1 star michelin restaurant wasnt the one i expected. 
the room, we had a suite, was exactelly what i was expecting, from the photos etc. very very nice, so modern and stylish, i felt really cosy. 
Finally the location is ideal, city centre, but not in the noisy places. Of course, ask for a higher floor, to avoid the trafiic noise.",5,2012,02,21
23,Treated like Royalty,"From the moment we arrived until 3 days later we were treated like Royalty. Yves Vandekerckhove requires an honourable mention as he was so kind and always accommodated our needs. Hotel breakfast buffet has a good selection and was tasty. Chocolates on the bed in the evening a nice touch. Concierge service exceptional. Our favourite restaurant in close proximity was the 4CATS. Subway close by and easy to get around the City. We were on the 4th floor and had no problems. Beds and sheets were so comfy. 
Thanks to all the staff for a great STAY.

23,Fabulous for couples,"my husband and I travelled here last Aug for a break without children and for that, this hotel was perfect.  The rooms are very modern- we struggled to find the hidden door to the loo and the shower is a glass box in the middle of the room- as I say perfect for couples, but perhaps not so if not!  The roof top pool is a real haven of tranquility and while drinks are expensive up there is is a fabulous way to spend an afternoon or late evening in the warm breeze.  The location is fabulous- the surrounding streets are far more interesting than Las Ramblas- the music hall opposite is well worth a tour and the concierge was able to point us in the direction of some excellent Tapas bars.  The road the hotel was on was busy, but it did not bother us.",5,2012,02,17
23,Stylish intro to Barcelona,"Location and staff - if those are good then you'll be forgiven almost anything. Not that the Ohla needs to be forgiven much. We had a good deal on a Junior Suite and were delighted to find it so quickly after getting off the airport bus.

Smooth check in - and those reviewers thinking the mezzanine check-in is odd should try standing in the lobby in February. Hats off to the concierge staff for at least trying to look warm!
Great breakfast (as previously reviewed) - there is a Starbucks directly opposite if you need an initial caffeine kick and don't have the same package. 

Lovely looking room with plenty of space, very good toiletries, linen and towels. Slightly firm bed, but not a big issue. Cheerful and efficient cleaning / turn down.

All in all, very close to 5 star rating, but there are a couple of minor eccentricities that pull it down. The single sink was plugless (as far as we could see) and there was soap but no soaptray provided. Odd. Kettle, cups and tea provided, but no coffee. Unless you asked for a machine at extra cost. I'm guessing instant coffee would have been provided had we asked, but we usually travel with a small supply anyway. We were 2nd floor, front. There is some underground noise 7am-11pm ish that was only mildly disturbing, traffic/street noise was minimal. We didn't like the fact that the window was subjected to spotlights outside, without extra blackout curtains - standard ones really didn't work. These lights are turned off in the early hours so that it isn't an issue all night but light sensitive souls should bring along eye shades just in case.

Too cold to use to roof/pool other than a brief photo trip, but it did look great for warmer days.

Would wholeheartedly recommend the Ohla for a first visit to Barcelona and will certainly check it out next time we visit.",4,2012,02,08
23,Ohla - Barcelona - Gatwick Cabs,"Its a while since I wrote a review and following all the negative publicity regarding false reviews/reviewers I thought I should put pen to paper and support TA.
Just been for a long weekend at Ohla in Barcelona.  Situated on the Via Leteatia (sp?) which runs parallel to La Rambla - its a real gem.   Very boutique - not many rooms but the best bar I have come across in Barcelona.  If cocktails are your thing then this is a must to visit and not horribly expensive either.   The rooms are minimal in decoration but very comfortable and of a very high standard.   The staff are all very friendly and the conciege excellent.   The cafe part is also a must visit.  A real twist on Tapas - steak tartare, the best fried prawn balls etc etc.   This is probably the besy hotel I have stayed in in Barcelona and certainly one of the best for a weekend away.   It was -1 degrees when we were there but we did go to the roof which in the summer would be perfect.  A small pool and lovely seating - a perfect way to waste an evening.  Probably not ideal for children    

A small moan - due to the snow the flight was delayed and Gatwick Cabs which seem to run a 100% monopoly wanted £160 for a cab to SW6.   Staggering - the sooner they allow black cabs the better and in the meantime use the Gatwick Express and hopefully Gatwick will stop this daylight robbery.",5,2012,02,06
23,Pleasant Stay - Superb Location,"This hotel can't be faulted for design. The whole look and feel is chic, sophisticated and well laid out. The roof terrace is stunning and there was obviously a lot of thought in how the property could be made unique. Which is brilliant because in our minds, when we travel we want something different to experience. And the Ohla Hotel definitely offers something different. 

Like many reviewers we stayed in a junior suite. I wasn't overly impressed with the materials used in the room as although the design was 'cool' it seemed a bit like it was decorated from IKEA. Just a personal opinion; however, it was modern, clean and open planned - meaning the bath area is not separate from the rest of the room. Having stayed in hotels with similar open plans, this was not a problem for us and just added to the charm. I was slightly disappointed that our bath did not face out the window as one of the pictures had shown. Rather, it was in the middle wall of the bath area. Lovely, but just a small disappointment on my behalf as I probably spent too much time analyzing their website photos and building different expectations. 

We may have hit an 'off' weekend however we weren't too impressed with the catering facilities. Upon check in we were told that we could eat as the restaurant would stay open until 01:00 (we checked in at midnight). We trekked to the room and ran down the stairs just to be told that unfortunately they closed at one midnight. No problem - room service! The menu had a good selection and only a few things would be available after 01:00 so we rushed to order - only to be told that unfortunately the menu is not correct and they stop at midnight. Mini bar it was.... good thing there was a lovely half bottle to share. 

Breakfast was good and varied. Included in the menu are a few made to cook items which was a nice surprise to the otherwise (high quality) continental style breakfast. 

Moving on the bar downstairs the next evening - we had some of the best cocktails that we have ever had and I am not kidding. Well thought out, perfectly executed and excitedly different than just your average martini. 

With all the good, their seemed to be a bad however...Service was horrendously slow - so much so that after waiting nearly 30 minutes for a second round we decided to leave. There were only four other customers in the bar! Tucking into the last bit of crisps on our table we noticed something hard. A chewed olive pit was in the bottle of our crisp bowl. Not pleasant at all. The staff apologized however it didn't leave a good taste in the mouth - pun intended! 

We decided to eat down the street (recommended by the hotel) at a place called Neyra - about a two minute walk from the hotel. As my husband is Spanish he was longing for some decent tapas. We weren't disappointed (one star to the hotel for such a great recommendation!) 

Next morning before our departure, we had breakfast. Eggs cooked to order took 25 minutes and had bits of shell in them. Oh dear... You can see a slight pattern here. 

On the positive side - the location is unbeatable. Las Ramblas is a short stroll away as is the waterside leisure centre. We did have a fantastic time. It wasn't flawless by no means and perhaps all of the glowing reviews set expectations which just couldn't be met during our stay. Having said that, it was a very nice hotel indeed.",4,2012,02,01
23,excellent choice,"The hotel is located in a good place. The bed was really comfortable that I had never wanted to get up. The hotel is quite luxurious.
The shower was transparent, which might not be appropriate for some lodgers! There was no kettle nor coffee maker.",5,2012,02,01
23,good but not 5 stars,"We stayed for 4 nights  in a classic room. Well I have mixed feeling about the hotel. It presents itself as a boutique hotel but please be ready that this is IKEA-like design. Maybe I do not understand Spanish modern but still... Two terrible things almost made me give 3 poits to them:
- the windows in the room are blocked. I hate this
- also it is very strange idea to build open bathroom in the room. You can imagine that the air in the room is not fresh. And you can not open the window, you have only aircondition.
All the rest was very good: the service was fine, breakfast was OK too, nice gastrobar, very good bar. And of course the location is very convenient - in Gothic quarter, less than one minute to metro, many of Barcelona attractions are reachable by walk. So please consider all pro and contra. Barcelona anyway is nice ) Vamos!",4,2012,02,01
23,A fantastic hotel and location !,"A fantastic hotel and location,this  is an amazing hotel, with great restaurants, bar to have a nice drink at night and an his great location makes it very very convenient.",5,2012,01,28
23,Anniversary bliss,"To celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, we travelled to Barcelona for a three-day break. The deal to stay at the Ohla Hotal was very good and though I read a couple of slightly negative reviews, the place was absolutely fantastic. The staff were lovely and we were treated to a complimentary bottle of cava when they discovered it was our anniversary. The hotel is central and just far (and close) enough away from La Rambla and there is a virtually limitless number of places to eat, drink and be merry. However the highlights of the hotel were; the tapas restaurant, which is just below street level and we were entertained on our first night by the hundreds of local football fans walking by, celebrating Barcelona's league title win that night; the rooftop bar and pool, though the latter is small and a bit revealing with a glass wall (however the views are great); and the cocktail bar, where the drinks are expensive but the barman put his heart and soul into making our drinks and they have some really funky chairs! All in all, a great time and a great place.",5,2012,01,23
23,"Gorgeous hotel, amazing honest staff","My partner and I stayed for 3nights in a junior suite, which was very contemporary, stylish and sexy. It suited us perfectly, as it was large and had all the amenities you need and was immaculately clean. We ate in the hotel one night as the concierge said they did the best tapas in town and we loved it. The kitchen is open in the restaurant and so you know standars are high Nd the staff were attentive and friendly. We drank in the hotel bar every night before going out and although small its a nice place to start and the bar staff are experts, telling you all about your drinks and watching them make them up is a great way to watch experts in this field at work, they are a credit to the hotel. Breakfast was lovely every morning and again staff lovely. Checking out I left diamond earrings, designer jewellery, cash and cards in the room as my partner had put them out of the safe so I assumed they had been packed. The hotel called immediately, but I had checked in at the airport so they sent everything back to me including cash I had left. I think this is lovely and amazing that cleaning staff on little wages would be so honest, but this is a reflection of the standards required by this hotel and demonstrates that their staff are employed for all the right reasons.  We could not fault this hotel in any way,  shape or form. It's strategically placed and is five minutes from anywhere you need to be and there is a train station around the corner, all the trip buses at Catalunya  square are just five minutes away and you are in the gothic quarter, so you cannot get much better location wise.  This hotel is geared towards couples or friends I feel, so if you want a nice hotel in a good area with excellent standards then this is for you.",5,2012,01,21
23,Almost perfect,"We studied this hotel carefully, and got a great deal on it for my 40th birthday.

This is a classical modern boutique hotel, located centrally in the heart of the Gothic district and a major transport route with easy walking distance to many of the major sites, and 3 blocks down from the Hop-on, Hop-off Barcelona buses, which are a great way to see the city.

Like others, it is a little weird that the check-in is half a floor up, but perhaps, that expands the boutique like feel to the location.

I must say that they pay great attention to all the little things, from the concierge giving you directions, to the chocolates on your bed sheets.

It was too bad that the roof top bar wasn't manned, and the roof top pool wasn't warmed.  I would have loved to have taken a swim with that view of the city, especially looking at the Gothic Cathedral and the sea beyond.  It's an absolutely stunning view.

The one major negative of the trip was dinner at the Restaurant.  For a Michelin star restaurant, the service was awful.  The food was excellent, but when it takes 15 minutes to order a meal, and 20 minutes to respond to a request for a cheque, that's simply not acceptable.  If I was giving away a Michelin star, I'd be taking it away just for the service in the restaurant.

However, it doesn't take away from an excellent, incredibly well located hotel.",4,2012,01,16
23,Great fun in Barcelona,"After months of research decided to stay at Ohla for 15 yr wedding anniversary. What a great choice, great room, restaurant and the rooftop pool who could complain. What a town!",5,2012,01,16
23,Ultra modern rooms with welcoming service and a fantastic rooftop pool and bar,"I enjoyed a pleasant night staying in the Ohla Hotel. The reception on a mezzanine floor is a slightly strange set up on arrival but the concierge was extremely helpful pointing me in the right direction. Check in was very friendly and straightforward.

The hotel room was very comfortable and modern with a helpful iPod dock/alarm and free wifi in the room. The toilet in the room was slightly difficult to find (push the 'cupboard' doors to find it. The glass walled shower in the middle of the room was hard to miss.

All of the staff were friendly and I imagine the rooftop pool will be amazing in the summer.

Recommended. ",5,2012,01,13
23,Not bad,"Nice boutique hotel where they give special attention and great attention to guests, enjoyed the city and it's atmosphere but didn't have a good night sleep not because of the hotel but because of our neighbors having some fun.

Staff is really friendly and guest orientated. They would cut themselves into pieces to answer your requests.

Great service, good location will be back for sure",4,2012,01,13
23,"stunning and sexy, I loved it","From reception on a mezzanine, to chilled lime water, this was one sexy boutique hotel. It's Mr. and Mrs Smith, which are a fabulous collection of hotels, basically a referral program.

Room was very funcky with all the mod cons, no bath my ONLY gripe. Breakfast was buffet and a la carte, and scrummy, the bacon was sensational. 

Service in concierge and front office and the Venezuelan Duty manager were fantastic, really really friendly. Internet included in the rate, I loved that.

Location, couldn't be any better, so central. Housekeeping was exceptional, with different pillow chocolates every night.

Overall I was uber impressed, praying for a bathtub upgrade next time I stay.

Thank you Ohlaa",5,2012,01,03
23,Good location,"We stayed for 4 nights in the junior-suit, a bit noisy at night but it was a beautiful room.  The breakfast was very good.  The pool was out of orde due to maintenance... The hotel opened this year in February, the service is at the moment of a 4 star hotel.  Very good location!",4,2011,12,17
23,excellent design hotel with good service,"well located , tastefully designed boutique hotel with good service and pleasantly spacious modern rooms .
surpassed my expectations and prefered it to the ohm",5,2011,12,16
23,"Great location, very boutique","Only stayed the one night so a flying visit. Check in as expected, lady said my bags would follow and true her word they appeared 3 mins after I got to my room and that never happens, very impressed. Standard room with a large bathroom and decent sized room nicely laid out with plasma tv and minibar. Beds are a little hard and actually seemed a little small (had twin bed). Bathroom was great, but I might have got a disabled room (no 114) as the shower was set for someone no taller than a dwarf! Had to stand with the shower head in my hand so not ideal and actually a little bit of a pain after a long day, I'm 5ft 7"". Generally nice room, shower a pain so worth checking with the hotel beforehand. Bar nice, but lacked atmosphere even with one of the best barmen in the world, so they told me. Max was great, but no one in the bar so felt I had to go to bed. Would stay again as great location, worth about £140 a night €150 i think and I work in the travel industry. Not sure its 5 star though, has a nice view from the terrace and a plunge pool so great for the summer.",4,2011,12,02
23,"Great location, friendly staff, relaxing and quiet",A great place for a relaxing stay in the ity centre,5,2011,11,27
23,Beautiful Experience,"Stayed 2 nights in Nov 2011.  Excellent service.  Excellent Bar, both Max and Santamaria were welcoming and a treat to watch as they made exceptional cocktails and handled the whole place between just the 2 of them.  Restaurant was great too (food and service).  Excellent location.  You can walk almost everywhere and for further places, connections to public transport is very good.  Concierge was helpful and knowledgeable.  Nice architecture.  Overall an unforgettable and beautiful experience.",5,2011,11,21
23,perfect in every way,"from arriving to departing the staff were impeccable.rooms were beatifully designed with great features.the hotel just made our visit so much more enjoyable.anybody who doesnt like the ohla hotel does not appreciate the word class,because i could not find fault.",5,2011,11,21
23,not good enough for price,"Stayed here over a wet weekend in November 2011. This is a stylish boutique hotel with a lot going for it. But there are some real problems. On arrival we waited for ever for the person behind the desk inside the entrance to direct us to reception (it turned out he was the concierge and he was dealing with other guests) and ended up working it out for ourselves by looking at the destination list by the lift. I'm all for minimal signage but this is ridiculous - when I arrive in a hotel, finding reception should not be an ordeal. It's up on floor 0.5, if you want to know. And when my friends arrived the day before they were treated very rudely by the concierge.

I made it clear when I booked the room that I needed a twin room because I'd be sharing with a friend who was married (not to me). We had twin beds but they were pushed together and after I separated them the cleaner pushed them back together. More annoying, the shower is very much open to the room which meant we awkrwardly had to sort things out so we had a bit of privacy. 

It took literally 20 minutes for the food we ordered for breakfast to be brought to our table. And you never saw such a glum looking bunch working in the kitchen area, which is open to the dining room. When it came, the breakfast was great, but the service left much to be desired (other staff were very friendly and helpful).

The main reason I wouldn't go back is simply cost. The location is great and on the whole I liked the decor, but the room was small, the shower cubicle being part of it was really not a success and it just wasn't worth what we paid.",3,2011,11,14
23,Can't wait to stay here again!,"Our company booked this hotel for MWC 2011. I was actually the very first guest to stay here. Yes.. I was #1 on the guest book! We checked in on the very first day it opened and every one was super nice and helpful. The restaurant and the bar had pretty good food. The rooms are spacious and swanky. I love the shower in the middle of the room! Overall the hotel was nice, modern, and clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. They even gave my co-worker and I a going away gift for being the first people to stay there! I can't wait until February of 2012 (MWC again!) to stay there again!",5,2011,11,12
23,Five Star Hotel with Five Start Service,"Stayed here for the last two nights of our honeymoon.  Beautiful hotel with modern rooms and decor in a great location.  The restaurants and bar in the hotel are both very high quality.  The roof top pool and lounge is an added bonus.  Only potential negative is the shower is all glass so if you're staying with someone that is not your partner, prepare to bare it all!",5,2011,11,09
23,Loved it!," Loved this hotel! Great location, excellent food at reasonable prices, fantasic cocktail bar. 

The room had a shower in the middle of the room - quirky and not as uncomfortable as you may think, given that it steamed up really quickly! Bed was incredibly comfy and both my husband and me really chilled out on our short, 3 night trip.

Negatives would be that the staff in the bar area were sometimes inattentive. My main bug-bear was when we went to the tapas restaurant at 11.30 and the manager told us that it was soon to shut - it was advertised as open till 
1am. He looked very perturbed by our 'late' arrival and told us that there were many things not on the menu - still that which we did order was unproblematic. I got the impression that he thought we had wandered in off the street and when we lay our room keys on the bar the service improved. Still, not what you expect from a 5* establishment.

That said, I would definitely return to Hola on future trips. Very recommended. ",5,2011,11,06
23,Part Very Good. Part Bad.,"The hotel is very mod.  Possibly not a first choice for our age group.

First the good.
Excellent location, very close to Palau de la Musica and Cathedral. Stunning roof top terrace, guests only, with great mojitos.  Groundfloor casual restaurant has very good food in tapas form.  Unfortunately the night we wanted to dine in the main restaurant, Michelin 1 Star, it was closed.  The junior suites are very comfortable and spacious enough for a modern hotel.  Cocktail Bar impressive.  Staff very good.

The Bad
You cannot open the windows to let fresh air in.  Air conditioning only.  The bathrooms are open plan to the living area emitting drain odours when the air conditioner is not running.  So leave the air conditioner on even when not in the room.",4,2011,10,26
23,A great Hotel!,"This was my first visit to Barcelona. I picked this hotel based on reviews of other travelling and i was very pleased with my choice. central location, brand new hotel (less than a year old). very pleasant staff who were quite humble and helpful. very quick room service. nice breakfast buffet. clean and quiet rooms. A few stuff missing to make it a superb hotel: 
1. Movie services ( they must have been kidding me when they brought me a DVD player when i requested watching some paid movies!) 
2. make sure you dont get two adjacent twin beds when u requested specifically a king size bed!
3. Lower the prices a bit (I paid 330 dollars a night!)",4,2011,10,15
23,Nearly perfect!,"Stayed 4 nights - so we had plenty of time to assess the hotel. 

Concierge - excellent - they will listen to your needs and advise well. 

Breakfast - very good, Tapas - absolutly excellent - sometimes it seems as though you are not venturing out but the food was outstanding and reasonably priced- don't waste the opportunity on your doorstep. 

Location - fantastic - next to metro - metro is very easy to understand and use. The Hotel is easy walking distance to beach, best restaurants, Ramblas, shopping, Gaudis architecture. 

Rooms were exceptionally clean, well finished and contemporary- we had a Design Room which was adequate in size , excellent shower in the middle of the room -  people whom want privacy when showering need to request a different type of room.

If you are new to Barcelona - we quickly got our bearings by going to the rooftop area to view the city. We highly recommend this Hotel and it has only been open since Feb this year. 

Very minor points against - cant believe they did not promote the michelin star restaurant. Sometimes contemporary is not the most practical - ie no plug for sink and little too dark to shave",5,2011,10,15
23,Out of 10 I give it an 11.,"We spent 2 nights at the hotel, Sept 30th and Oct 1st, everything was spot on fabulous, the decor elegant with a hip vibe, the food was excellent, best coffee in the world! Concierge Albert and his staff could not have been more friendly or better informed, an allover delightful experience.",5,2011,10,10
23,Great Hotel & Location,"Really loved the room.  Concierge Mattheu was very helpful.  The bartender made drinks with such a precision and spectacle, I have never seen anybody ever.  They were delicious too.  The lobby is just ok, almost a little retro feeling.  The check-in however was annoying as they only had one person taking care of several guests.  The lady herself was nice though.  Service altogether was great.  My dad went to the pool and thought it was tiny.  The location was very convenient.
I would definitely go back, mostly because of the room and location.",5,2011,10,07
23,Great Hotel!,"We checked into the Ohla Hotel on September 23, 2011 for a good night's rest before we embarked on our Mediterranean cruise and we were not disappointed! The hotel is in a great location and not far from La Rambla (Barcelona's touristy street). The exterior of the hotel is beautifully done and the interior was interesting and funky. The staff were courteous, helpful and spoke English very well. The rooms are spacious, well decorated and well maintained. The in-room dining was well above average as was the restaurant and bar area. If you are looking for five star accommodations in a great location in Barcelona; look no further!",5,2011,10,05
23,Made for an incredible stay in Barcelona.,"My partner and I stayed at the Ohla Hotel for 7 days and nights at the end of September during La Merce.  We had an awesome time.  Ohla is situated in a perfect area to explore all parts of the city.  We only used public transportation one time during our stay... and it was only because we were late for a reservation.  The hotel was extremely clean and the staff was attentive.  We honestly did not have a single bad experience here.  

Tip:  We had the opportunity to stay in both a Junior Suite and a Design Suite.  We actually ended up enjoying the layout of the Design Suite more... maybe it was the shower situated in the middle of the room.  If you are looking for more privacy when traveling then I would definitely suggest the Junior Suite as they have an area separate from the bedroom for the bath, shower and toilet.  The Junior Suite also provides a bit larger bed then the Design.  The showers are amazing and the beds are very comfortable in both. 

I highly recommend the cocktail bar and the Gastro tapas bar.  We had some of the best cocktails we've ever experienced at the cocktail bar... and some of the best tapas in BCN at the Gastro restaurant.  

I hope this was helpful!  Enjoy!",4,2011,10,02
23,Ohla was oh-my fantastico!,"My friends and I met here for a fabulous reunion weekend, and agreed the place is just delightful.  Great location, outstanding restaurant, spacious rooms, swanky bathrooms, and a rooftop pool and bar / terrace that overlooks the Barcelona skyline, down to the sea.  Bliss.",5,2011,09,25
23,Go!!!!!,"Great tapas, this place is a must go to, try the confit of lamb neck fillet, and steak tartare is just fantastic .can't wait to go again next year.",5,2011,09,25
23,"Rooms great, service great, public areas poor","We stayed in Junior suite which is well appointed with seating area, extensive wardrobes, spacious and functional modern bathroom.  The tub was deep and a big shower with overhead shower or hand held. Towels and bedding excellent and in room tea and coffee facilities.

The television is fixed to the wall and not able to be angled for different viewing positions. The mini bar is extensive and very expensive.

We turned right at the front corner of the hotel into a small foot traffic only street next to the hotel and found many eating options.  We did not eat at the hotel.

We missed having a comfortable communal seating/lobby area where you can sit and have coffee, read the paper, or be sociable. I found the hotel a little more like a serviced apartment building in this regard.

The staff were really good, pleasant and a strong point of the hotel.

Sound travels up to the rooms from the street, which is busy even through the night.",4,2011,09,25
23,"Excellent, chic restaraunt","We did not have the pleasure of staying at this hotel, but did enjoy wonderful Tapas for lunch today.
The entire meal was beautiful
Lly cooked and very plateful, staff were polite and courteous and the entire experience was a treat.
The ambience at lunch is one of chic, stylish cool and our party of 10 was thoroughly impressed. The restaurant was air conditioned and gives the chance to watch the world go by while enjoying their finest fare.
This one is recommended!",5,2011,09,19
23,Definitely one to stay at again,"I stayed with 3 friends for a weekend trip and the Ohla was a great find. Close enough to everything in downtown Barça but not on the main Ramblas (which is noisy, over priced and over rated!). I would definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona.

The good stuff:

The staff couldn't have been more helpful, from check in staff to the consierge service and housekeeping staff.

Our rooms were an excellent size with everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel. Spotlessly clean and well equiped with ipod docking stations, HD TV and the biggest towels I've seen!

The rooftop pool and terrace - a real joy and just what you need after a days sightseeing in the summer heat. Great views out over the city too.

The not so good:

As with all boutique hotels they have their style quirks - here it is the bathrooms which is the only slight negative to the design. The glass shower cubicle is on full view to bedroom so if you value your privacy be warned.

The lifts - it's an old building so the lifts are small and slow.

Breakfast & mini bar - very expensive. 2 of our group arrived a day early and hadn't realised that breakfast wasn't included. Breakfast for 2 people came to €38 for bacon and egg. The next day we went out to a cafe nearby where 4 of us ate for less than half the price!",4,2011,09,12
23,Really feel the City vibe,"great hotel, service, rooms, staff, and a fabulous location to enjoy all of Barcelona's delights, great chill out roof terrace(even if the mojitos are way over priced) funky roof top pool, with glass sides, makes interesting viewing of some guests antics in it.

Car parking is also too expensive at 30 euros a day, but overall a great place to base yourself and enjoy this incredible city,  

i would reccomend to avoid Las Ramblas, tacky dirty smelly full of pickpockets and hookers, instead hit Paeso El Born, very cool great bars, restaraunts and shops.

If you like football it is worth every euro to see Barcelona play at Camp Nou, obtain ticktes from atourist info office, all very easy, cost determined by oppostion, so not cheap, but incredible.,

For a eating experience try Comerc 24....... Calle Comerc, ex El Bulli.",4,2011,09,07
23,Perfect Location,"This new hotel is situated right where you want to be. Walking distance to everything.
Staff is very helpfull and friendly. Price is on the rich side but well worth it compared to other hotels in Barcelona.",5,2011,08,31
23,"Excellent Service, Fantastic Room, Brilliant Location","This was by far one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.  The location was perfect, walking distance to the Ramblas (5mins), seafront (15 mins)  and enough shopping to tire anyone out (starts on your doorstep).  The hotel staff were excellent.  We had an issue with the lights in our room and this was sorted out quickly and efficiently and you could not fault the team for ensuring that our stay was not disrupted, this type of excellence is service is hard to come by and the Ohla hotel surpassed itself. The concierge was  excellent helping us miss all the queues to the key sites, definitely speak to them before heading out.  We would highly recommend hotel to friends, looking for a luxurious and relaxing break.",5,2011,08,30
23,The Best Possible location !,Certainly a 5 star hotel. Nice designed rooms with minimalistic decoration. Loved the bathroom amenities. The service was very polite and willing to answer or find solutions to occurring problems. The location is IDEAL! Right next to metro station and within a walking distance to Barcelona downtown. We hope we'll come back again!,5,2011,08,20
23,Wonderful Barcelona Experience,"We are a family of four (two adults, two kids under 14). We had weekend at the Ohla and really enjoyed it. The pool on the roof is lovely and lounging in the day-beds with a Sangria while the kids swam, was a real treat after a day of wondering around Barcelona. 
The food is superb. We sat up at the bar watching the chef cook our tapas.
Yes its not cheap, but if a budget holiday is what you want go to Travelodge.
We'd go back to Ohla.",5,2011,08,16
23,Great Hotel!,"We recently vacationed in Barcelona at the Ohla Hotel at the end of July and truly enjoyed our stay. We booked the Design Deluxe room, and were given a room on the 1st floor which was not optimal due to the noise from the metro and the noise from the street. I immediately asked reception if they could switch the room, but was told they were completely sold out. But after being awoken the next morning at 8am from the noise I called reception and they were extremely accommodating moving us to the 6th floor and even let us look at the room to make sure we were happy before making the change. The hotel is in a great location in the Barri Gotic neighborhood with an extremely friendly staff. The decor is modern and clean with a fantastic roof top deck with incredible views. I would definitely stay at the Ohla Hotel on my next visit to Barcelona!",5,2011,08,15
23,"Great Location, Great rooms!","This is a great hotel. The rooms are really different from what you have seen. We stayed on the Junior suite room which had a great view of the road and was very sunny. The shower is exposed to the rest of the room and so is the bathtub. I believe that the room meets more the needs of a couple than a family's. 

Rooms were extremely clean and the cleaning staff did a really thorough job. 

I read some reviews saying that staff is not that good. I strongly disagree. Whatever we asked was delivered fast and the staff was very polite. Information was provided regarding restaurants in the town, bars, tickets for theaters and so on. 

Beds and pillows were really comfortable and felt great. 

Mini bar was very extensive but ridiculously overpriced. They charged 8 euros for an energy drink and 4,75 euros for 330 ml of still water.  

Cuisine was very good and atmosphere on the gastronomy restaurant was really fantastic. A bit overpriced again but it worths having a dinner. 

The terrace is unique with great panoramic view and nice lounge atmosphere at any time (day or night). 

Location is perfect because while you are in the center you are just a 5 minute walk from the main touristic street which is La Rambla. Also while it is on a main avenue the hotel is really quiet due to good insulation of the windows. 

Overall a great choice for Barcelona we were totally satisfied by our stay there.",5,2011,08,15
23,It's a great hotel in a perfect location,"I took my mother to Barcelona for a few days and stayed in Ohla Hotel. The location was perfect - it's on the edge of the old part of the city and only 20mins by taxi from the airport. It's a great area to walk around, particularly for the older generation as it's mostly flat. The hotel is  only 10mins walk to the beach through small, winding and quaint streets which comprise lovely small boutique shops, cafes and bars. The main shopping streets are close by so if you want to shop for clothes you can go to bigger high street shops (Zara, H&M, Mango etc) although I preferred the smaller boutiques.

Take care when walking around Barcelona - it's well sign posted in the guide books but there are pick pockets waiting to take advantage of the tourists - we saw it first hand in our first stroll out in the streets. Just be sensible when you're out and keeping bags close to you.

The great thing about Ohla is it's bar and pool located on the 8th floor roof terrace. It's breezy, has stunning views across the city (including the port) and has lovely seating where you can relax to soft music. After a few hours walking the streets it was great to go to the pool and sunbathe with a glass of wine. It's open in the evening too, so pre dinner drinks are a must. It's also the perfect way to kill those last few hours waiting for your flight home.

Breakfast was great if you don't want to try the local food. If you choose the hotel buffet then book in advance as it's a little cheaper than turning up on the day.

The only down side to this hotel is that if you aren't travelling as a couple then there is very little privacy in the hotel rooms. As you would expect in a new boutique hotel, it's decoration is very stylish - and that means the lovely big shower is encased in a glass cubicle within the bedroom. If you're not travelling with your partner then you may not like the lack of privacy!

I would recommend this hotel to anyone - service, location and facilities were perfect and even though we were on the first floor there was no noise from the street below.",5,2011,08,12
23,"Beautiful hotel, poor service","We kicked off our honeymoon in this beautiful recently renovated hotel in our favorite city. The staff were lovely, the food in both the restaurants was excellent (one of them is one star Michelin) and the roof terrace was lovely. However their ability to answer the reception phone and to service  rooms was poor. For me this is basic stuff. If I thought that this was just a one off issue I would happily say so but in fact my friends who were also staying there encountered the same issue.  It is just not acceptable for a five star hotel not to answer the phone and then when you go down 
to reception to find it empty. It is also not acceptable to request a room to be cleaned and to come back three hours later and find it not done. When I raised the issue upon check out I received only an apology and was informed that "" we are only open 4 months"" Extremely poor response. I was so disappointed it's a really lovely space. ",3,2011,08,09
23,Great modern hotel in perfect location!,"We loved this very modern and minimalist hotel! The small rooftop pool had a really nice  deck/lounge area to enjoy a drink and look over the rooftops of Barcelona. We booked a junior suite and while the room was not huge, it was very well designed. The bed was very comfortable and we had plenty of space for the extra bed for our 5 year old. The hotel provided lots of toiletries and plenty of soft towels throughout our stay. Our room looked out onto the busy street (Via Laietana) and although there was some slight noise, none of it was bothersome enough to disrupt our sleep or any part of our stay. The blackout curtains were a nice touch as well and very helpful as we got over our jetlag! The service at both the reception desk and at the concierge desk were personable and helpful. There were many sites within a 15 minute walk. 

There were a few minor things that were a little off - the small separate bathroom smelled strongly of fresh paint throughout our four days there, you can feel the metro below but not enough to be problematic, the 40 euro per day supplement for an extra bed didn't include breakfast for our child and seemed a little pricey - but overall, we really loved this hotel! If you are into modern design, you would also enjoy this hotel.",5,2011,08,08
23,"Very cool, excellent food, excellent position, excellent cocktail bar","A brand new hotel with an excellent location and excellent facilities. They have headhunted the best restaurant and bar staff from around the World, (make sure you get Max to make you a Martini). It may be considered expensive, BUT, you do get what you pay for and therefore I would consider it excellent value for money. We will be back without hesitation.",5,2011,07,24
23,Enjoyed our stay,"As one other reviewer mentioned - the longer I stayed the more I liked it.
The rooms were minimalist but had everything you needed.  Comfortable beds, beautiful linen, great shower and shower products, very quiet, turn-down with a chocolate, free wi-fi.
We used the rooftop pool and were lucky enough to be the only ones there as it is a small pool with not a lot of area around it to sit or sun-bake.
The concierge service is what made our stay at the Ohla great as well.  Mathieu and Albert were very helpful and delightful to deal with.
The location was great.  Close to Las Ramblas but without the chaos.",4,2011,07,16
23,"Nice location, bad value, will not be back","I think you have to take into account that this is a new hotel and they are trying very hard to be different. We made the mistake of not doing enough research and I we could have got much better value from a four star hotel in the same area. The location is great, right in the middle of the old town. The concierges were okay and tried hard but didn’t really know much about Barcelona and didn't have much advice by way of restaurants to eat in. The hotel is trying very hard to be minimalist and different but it really doesn’t work and makes for a very impersonal experience. We booked a junior suite but in reality it was just a small room with a shower and bath in the room! The mini bar and snacks are very overpriced and the room was noisy from the street despite being on the 4th floor. The roof chill out area with pool was very disappointing, very small pool and no atmosphere at all. Overall we were disappointed, I think it would be a good hotel for a business traveller. If you are paying, go elsewhere! Nice hotel but tried way too hard and cost far too much, sorry won’t be back... ",3,2011,07,05
23,Fabulous modern funky  hotel with great staff and great amenties,"We had 4 nights at the Ohla and we were very impressed.  The hotel is very clean and modern with everything you need to make a stay comfortable and enjoyable.  One of the criteria for choosing the hotel was for the swimming pool...which is pretty small, but the pool deck is a lovely area..(they could do with a few more sun lounges though)
The rooms have very comfortable king sized beds and are quiet and the hotel is within walking distance from most major attractions, or easy metro travelling.
The hotel conceirge were very professional and helpful.
Fabulous cocktails in the downstairs hotel bar
The only thing I didnt personally ""like"" about the room we stayed in was the ""Open"" shower....its only a room for couples....
We would definitely return to this hotel!! Really enjoyed our stay",5,2011,06,29
23,Great find!,"Spent 4 nights at Ohla in June and was very impressed with the hotel. The longer we stayed the more we enjoyed it. Excellent concierge service, smart modern rooms although smallish were well designed with excellent finishes and a delightful rooftop with pool and sun deck. The location places you within easy walking distance to Ramblas, Borne district, food markets, Passieg de Gracia, metro etc. The cocktail bar adjacent the entrance gets a special mention - superb drinks and great people watching. Thoroughly recommend.",5,2011,06,29
23,What a find!,"Found this hotel via Trip Advisor and used it for three days after leaving a cruise ship in Barcelona; arrived at 0900 but the very helpful concierges were able to safely store our bags until we could check in. 

Great location about five minutes from La Rambla so is much quieter than hotels on that (noisy) road plus it is close to Plaza Catalunya for the hop on/off buses and there is a metro station almost outside the hotel front door.

Ultra modern hotel with very high quality towels, bed linen, showers etc and spotlessly clean but best of all are the helpful staff who made our short stay so enjoyable. We were given help with where to go, where to eat and finding our way around plus the bar staff and restaurant staff were helpful too; even managed to get a late checkout which helped with our last day.

Breakfast and a lunch we ate there were all good and by Barcelona standards very good value.

Has a decent size gym for this size of hotel but best of all a roof top pool and area to chill out - not a large pool but ideal for a cool off and a haven of peace - great place to chill and it even has bar service!

All in all faultless and cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2011,06,17
23,Interesting and different,"My daughter and I spent four nights in the Ohla after traveling from Madrid. I had read previous reviews, so I was prepared for the 'interesting"" shower location!! My daughter had a puzzled look though! I love the fact that everything was new and had a bit hipflavor. This hotel was not my first choice, howevever the roof lounge area was my incentive for booking the Ohla. I did use it each day to relax and read for an hour. The concierge staff was very helpful. I too was not impressed with the check-in staff. We did have some difficulty with our hair dryer. It kept going out on us. Finally we were given another, however, it must have been more of an electrical issue. The bar and drinks were a real show!!  Met interesting people and the mixologist's creations were impressive.  Someone else mentioned the card-key being necessary for lights. For me this was not the first time I've experienced this in European hotels, so it was not an issue. To me the great thing about traveling to other countries is things can be a bit different. Chalk it up to a learning experience!!!The location of the hotel was perfect. We were able to walk everywhere. I love the winding,old streets. Barcelona is a lovely city and I feel as though I just touched the surface in four days. If I ever return I would try another hotel just to get another flavor, not because I was dissatisfied for the most part.",4,2011,06,16
23,Great hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"We have just returned from a week-end in Barcelona. We stayed at the Ohla and had a great time.  The highlights included:

- The great cocktail bar downstairs - the gold leaf topping was a real plus!
- The brasserie restaurant - pop in for Tapas, a little pricey, but worth it
- The hotel room. Well designed and well finished. 
- The pool bar - head for the roof
- The central location - 5 mins walk and your on the Rambla, 10-15 mins walk at the beach
- Friendly, professional service

We'd stay there again for sure.",5,2011,06,14
23,Service Needs Improvement,"Although they claim to be a 5 star hotel, I would say it is more of a 4 star property.  I've never been to a 5 star hotel that does not offer turn down service in the evening.  The design of the rooms are very modern and unique with the shower being located in the middle of the bedroom.  However, this didn't work too well for our teenage daughter and son who each wanted their privacy.  The shower also leaked all over the floor of the room.  I found the concierge staff to be very friendly, but not very knowledgable and I found the reception staff to be somewhat rude.  I understand the hotel just opened in February, but they will need to work out the kinks in both their service and rooms before I would stay there again.",3,2011,06,12
23,Excellent location & bar - TERRIBLE service!,"Barcelona seems to really lack great hotels in great location! The Ohla hotel was nice and clean, but had TERRIBLE service and young, incompetent staff. After checking in, our room was ready which was nice, but the reception staff is hardly competent. After immediately asking for a hypoallergenic pillow and calling down to reception (which is only one place to call - forcing you to be on hold for 10 minutes waiting)... I never got my pillows. Then, I had to call downstairs again, the one number to reach anybody.., and ask for wash cloths. Waited a couple of hours - no wash cloths ever showed up. Finally before going to bed, I called down again and the concierge explained that in Spain they are more like an in b/w size from an american small wash cloth and a towel....strange... I said ""well tahnk you for finally lettting me know this - and we had ZERO of those in our room."" He said he'd send some up, they never showed up. Another annoying thing about this place - everytime you turn the lights on - you have to leave you room key (the only ONE you get) in the slot by the door. Beyond annoying! When my husband ran out for a hot sec, we had no lights on for a good ten minutes! 
Overall, i would not stay here again because of the terrible service. But I will say that the rooftop terrace is beautiful, but not great since they don't have a full bar up tehre - only wine/beer/coffee. So we had to go downstairs to the super-modern bar area which was the best part of our stay there. The drinks! The location is also great, but still would stay elsewhere. This property is also a four-star property. It could never compare to any five stars I've ever stayed at.
(We stayed a the Hilton Metropole at the end of our trip and it was a million times nicer, but in a terrible location!)",3,2011,06,07
23,not such a positive experience!!,"we have returned from a trip to barcelona which we split between the wonderful Neri hotel(amazing experience) and the Ohla..we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday..so,as it was my treat to him and wanting everything to be just right,I had phoned the hotel before booking on their site,explaining that I wanted a jnr suite with all of the trimmings as this was a birthday treat..(they did kindly leave a bottle of cava for my husband)however the room was not the jnr suite as seen in the photos,it was small and on the 1st floor and no matter how brightly the beautiful Barcelona sun was shining,it remained dark in room 106..rather than a view of the city,we could see only traffick and the rumble of the metro shook our foundations every few minutes..I returned to reception straight away with the very courteous concierge(who understood my issue),only to be told by the surly receptionist(who asked the concierge to tell us and barely looked up herself)that they were booked out and that we could not move tomorrow to another suite as she had grand prix visitors staying in them from the thurs(the day we were leaving)??this made little sense as we were there now! but she was not moving us..she said we could downgrade though(wouldn't that be nice!!!!}we were not happy,but it was hardly a third world problem and we returned to the room and got on with the holiday,though it left a very sour taste..I was awoken early on checkout day by the traffick and metro rumbling,so I decided to go and speak with the front of house mgr,who had left the obligatory""we hope you enjoyed your stay""note.she was a very polite girl who listened,but insisted she had not been informed of our complaint,and most annoyingly of all,told me had she known ""we could have moved you to a much nicer jnr suite,on your 2nd day""thus proving all is not equal in this establishment..turns out ours was the smallest and darkest of rooms in its category..she said the general mgr would be interested in speaking with me as customer service is so important to them,but surprisingly!that did not happen,nor did the email/phone call I was promised from her..I don't enjoy writing such a negative review,but feel it necessary,it really seems that while we were there they had much more important guests on their minds,ie. the grand prix visitors whom the receptionist was saving the better rooms for!!!!..on the positive side the concierge team are really wonderful as are the cocktails..the rooftop pool is great(though I've seen better)..I'm sure we would have had a much more positive view of this hotel had we indeed been given ""one of their nicer jnr suites""the one I'd booked ....",2,2011,05,23
23,Excellent service with comfortable surroundings!,"My husband and I stayed at the Ohla hotel May 9th (the night before our cruise) and came back for one more night (22nd) before flying back home.  We really enjoyed staying at this hotel.   It's modern, VERY clean, comfortable, quiet,and in a good location.  All of these things are important but what stood out about this hotel was the service!  I was especially impressed with the concierge.  The guys were exceptionally helpful and went way beyond  their ""obligation"" to me as a guest. Besides giving advice about the area, they helped fix my computer when I was unable to get online.  Even when things were busy they made time to help me out.   Customer service is evidently a high priority with them.  Albert Meier is over all the concierges and was helpful in setting up some sightseeing for us among other things.  Daniele Abbate and Beltrand Greome helped me with my computer problems in addition to seeing that our luggage was brought immediately to our room.  All three of these men were genuinely concerned, gracious, and did everything they could to make us feel at home as well as feeling special.  We had a very nice room the first night, but we got a very different room on the second night.  They put us in a beautiful suite with a great view, lots of room, and many ""extras"".  I just can't say enough about the wonderful treatment we received and I highly recommend this hotel if you want to spend some time in Barcelona.",5,2011,05,22
23,Wonderful service in a great location,"Our first time in Barcelona and we chose the new Ohla Hotel.  They say new hotels have teething problems.  Not this one - the welcome by both concierge and check in was friendly and very helpful.  During our stay nothing was too much trouble.  If the concierge desk didn't know the answer to our endless questions they found out (however their knowledge was excellent).  The hotel is located in the beautiful gothic area - a short 5-8 minute walk to the Ramlas through beautiful cobblestones streets.  The rooms are very functional, clean, free wifi and iPod docks - for some it may take a short time to get used to the open shower in the middle of the room but it's a great shower.  Room was serviced beautifully daily.  We could not fault this hotel. Food services excellent.   If you are looking for old style rooms this is not for you but in saying that I would highly recommend hotel Ohla.",5,2011,05,14
23,"Magnificent facility, superb staff and unbeatable location - Seriously stop looking elsewhere...","From beginning to end  the Ohla hotel superseded all (I must admit because of the pictures and website) my already high expectations! The staff was superb - welcoming, warm and overwhelmingly friendly yet genuine and gave us plenty of great to-do suggestions. The attention to details of the facilities, rooms and service gives you the warm fuzzy feeling and the location is simply unbeatable. Barcelona is a magnificent city and the Ohla hotel was like the cherry on the parfait and made our stay a wonderful experience. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel with the Ohla being located on Carrer Comtal there were so many wonderful breakfast bakeries and coffee shops to enjoy each morning. The room was clean lined zen-trendy, ridiculously spacious and we had a retina stretching view. I loved the hidden toilet. Finally a designer that understood a toilet bowl isn't really a feature...Barcelona has almost too much to offer and will require a swift encore. I can't imagine staying any were else but at the Ohla on my next visit. For such a new kid in the block I can see them swiftly carving a steady stream of success if they keep it up.",5,2011,05,06
23,Top shelf,"I am a 110 to 130 days traveler per year. Thus I visit quite a few hotels. I decided to bring my wife to Barcelona for her 50th birthday. So I went a bit upmarket compare to my usual business hotel. Then again I stay to good hotel like Hilton, Sheraton, intercontinental, etc.

At first it looks like a fair price to pay for a 5 stars hotel. In the end I found that it was an extraordinary deal. The room (a junior suite) was beautiful, comfortable and fairly quiet compare to some of the comment I saw on Expedia (booking site). Actually it was one of the nicest rooms I stayed. The restaurant was quite a bonus as we are foody (we only ate at the Tapas place rather the Michelin star restaurant. The pool on the last floor, while cold at this time of the year, is a piece of art surrounded by comfortable sofas and long chair. Great music and delivery from the Tapas place downstairs.

Now the icing on the cake was the bar on the ground floor. The guy behind the bar is an Award winning mixologist with friendly staff. This is a fantastic way to finish a night of food in this marvellous town with a few nightcaps. No headache in the morning!?

Note that this is located in the Gothic neighbourhood. This is in my mind where most of the thing are or the most central to all to see in this gorgeous town.

11 out of 10 in my book. Will recommend to all and certainly be back soon.",5,2011,05,01
23,"WOW, really nice...","Stayed 9-15 March Junior suite # 511

Brand new design hotel. Excellent location. Wonderful, helpful and service minded staff (I don’t agree with previous negative reviews regarding the service). Interior design fabulous. Cool roof top pool/bar area which will be the hot spot this summer in Barcelona! Great restaurant with wonderful food. Room service very quick and good (club sandwich and gaspacho excellent although didn’t like their hamburger which despite asking it to be well done it was served very red and not tasty). Cool bar and great cocktails! Bed very comfortable. Possibility to choose bed sheets, pillows and the scent of your bed linen. Beautiful bathroom with 2 sinks, bathtub and separate shower. Almost all lightening in the room can be dimmed.

Few drawbacks though (and could be start up issues):
- TV in room should have an arm to swing it in different positions to make easier watch from bed or from the sofa.
- IPOD docks in all rooms should be standard (had to ask for one).
- Despite being 5th floor and towards quiet street heard noise during night from garbage collection.
- Room had French balconies but windows could not be opened.
- Lacking a full body mirror in the room.
- Junior suite has a kettle however set for 5 cups of Nescafe cost €25, which should be free of charge. Starbucks is just across the street.
- Bathroom lightening could be better. Should be 2 more spots above the sinks.
- The gym is small (1 cross trainer, 1 bicycle and 2 treadmills) and lacking free weights and a bench.
- The reception area (half floor up) feels very cramped and doesn’t match with the rest of the hotel’s design. I hope this was a temporary solution.
- Unfortunately hotel missed room upgrade and bottle champagne which was supposed to be arranged on our arrival.

All in all, I was very impressed with the hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,03,29
23,Barcelona's Best Kept Secret,"Stayed here last Tuesday and I was well impressed with the hotel. I took the taxi from the airport and the taxi driver had not even heard of the hotel before ( only opened last month ).
When we got there he was suitably impressed by the facade. 'Nice hotel' he said and as soon as I entered the premises I knew the taxi driver was right. Very warm welcome by the concierge and a friendly check in receptionist made the check in experience pleasant. 
The room was spacious and well designed though I wasn't quite sure about the location of the shower cubicle in the middle of the room.
That aside the facilities were topnotch. The two restaurants were superb. One of them Sauc has a Michelin star.
Location wise it is perfect too. Only a short walk from Placa Catalunya and a metro station right across the road. I discovered that the main stop for the airport buses was just a few minutes walk away....could have saved myself some euros if I had taken the Aerobus instead of the taxi from the airport.
Overall I will definitely return to this hotel and hopefully my team will do better the next time we play Barcelona!",5,2011,03,12
23,great hotel with exceptionally friendly and helpful staff,We stayed in this hotel for five nights. From the very beginning we were aware of the friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The rooms were very modern and despite the very central location we slept soundly at night. Everywhere was spotlessly clean. The rooms weree spacious and airy. The front of house staff were excellent and gave us wonderful recommendations for restaurants. What a great place. Keep up the good work!,5,2011,03,07
23,'Eye' catching,"The only sign of this beautiful building being a hotel is the name on the front door.  This gives you an idea of the hotel theme; Minimalistic, black and chic.  
Our room was one of the junior suites.  It was a good size had a large, very comfortable bed and a sofa.  The room had a double ended bath and a large shower.  There were plenty of towels and toiletries supplied.
We were able to access the roof top ‘chill’ area on one evening and one day of our 3 day stay.  The hotel had been open less than a week and were photographing and putting the finishing touches around the hotel.  The space will be a great area in the summer.
We had an evening meal and spent time in the bar area.  The food was excellent and the service from their knowledgeable staff was an asset, particularly Donald in the restaurant and Max in the bar.
The ONLY downside of the hotel was the rumbling of the metro that could be heard in our room periodically.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a short stay in the city.",5,2011,02,26
23,Nice new hotel - very mixed staff attitude,"The Ohla is a new hotel I happened to come across and decided to book for a weekend stay due to attractive soft opening rates.
It has a boutique feel about it; still quite a few traces of a refurbishment, but thats ok for soft-opening. The room was very nice with some smart features - very nice and actually working power shower, nice bathtub and smartly hidden separate toilet; nevertheless slightly coldish feel of the room decor - maybe because there is nothing in terms of pictures photos etc. on the walls. All in - a good product.
However, staff attitude is quite inconsistent: warm welcome with an offer of something to drink by the receptionist; however, very disinterested concierge and the -by far- rudest check-out person I have had in years. No smile, no hello, no how was your stay, no good bye - just a rustiquely snorted ""Check-out?!"" 
the locationn is quite good - a few minutes walk from the ramblas, but Via Laietana is not all that charming with lots of traffic. Prefer to stay up in the Eixample. Rooms dont block out noise from busy road. However, comfy bed is still conducive to slumber.
Actually intended to go back for a nice weekend with my partner, but it left such an unpleasant aftertaste that we decided to book an alternative. Plenty of nice places in this wonderful city.
So - mixed experience. Try for yourself.",3,2011,02,26
23,"Modern, sophisticated and easy","The Ohla Hotel is new to Barcelona and its recently opened rooms are immaculate and staff are super-keen as a result. 

The exterior may be historic, as is the nature of Barcelona, but the inside is ultra-modern and minimalist. How minimalist? It's tough to find the toilet in your room. It's actually hidden behind a moving wall. 

The amenities are new, clean and slick, though. My room had a big TV, a queen-size bed with extra large pillows, a large window and free Wi-Fi (very important). 

The only potential problem with my room (a luxury one) was that the shower and its transparent doors are plonked in the middle of the room. Not one to share with someone you don't know, then. 

The staff were very helpful, ordering taxis and arranging for the arrival of lost luggage. The turn-down service was also prompt and everyone put up with my English. 

The breakfast menu could be better, and the room service burgers are tiny (order dessert!), but the overall experience was great and I would definitely return.",5,2011,02,21
23,a great stay,"I stayed over at the ohla for the mobile congress and have to say, for a hotel that has so newly opened, they got it right first time. Great location, great building, the staff couldn't be more helpful and attentive. My room was immaculate. I would firmly recommend the experience.",5,2011,02,19
23,Had great stay,"I was in town for the Mobile World Congress and I had great service and treatment for the duration of my stay.  Having stayed in Barcelona several times previously, I can say that this hotel, although new, exceeded my expectations.  Had a great night sleep and a great conference.  I would certainly recommend staying here for the business traveler, romantic getaway, or just to explore Europe.",5,2011,02,17
23,Rude  Front desk Service So much For 5 Star,"For a 5 star hotel the staff is untrained in the word service.
A bare lobby passes off as minimalist but there is no luxe to be found.",1,2011,02,15
23,Qualitative city break,"Very clean and well maintained hotel in the middle of town. A lot is within walking distance. Our room was very spacious and quiet.

Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fine. Highly recommended for a city break.",4,2024,09,01
23,"Excellent, but shame about the breakfast","Beautiful hotel, modern and ""artistic"" at the same time, convenient to the main attractions of Barcelona. The reception staff were very kind, truly compliments for the welcome and care towards the customer. Excellent rooms and a breathtaking rooftoop. The only flaw, but not a small one, is a breakfast that is too international, with hot drinks not freshly prepared by the staff, and a truly paltry brioche/croissant section. For the rest, a good experience.",4,2024,05,29
23,Perfect for a city stay,"A beautiful hotel with very attentive and friendly staff located in the middle of the Gothic Quarter.
We stayed there for three nights with our two boys (16 and 12 years) and really enjoyed it.
Particularly worth mentioning is the beautiful roof terrace with rooftop bar. There are lots of comfortable seating areas that invite you to linger.
The pool is a bit too small to swim in, but the view of the city roofs and the cathedral is phenomenal. The drinks are in the upper price segment, but very tasty. The rooftop bar is also very popular with external guests. Hotel guests always have priority and always get a table.
 
We have rarely experienced such good service in a hotel as we did here. The hotel staff is incredibly friendly and attentive! Drinks and chocolate are offered when checking in.
For breakfast there is a delicious buffet with Spanish cheeses, salami and ham. Fresh fruit and varieties of muesli and yoghurt are on the counter. Everyone takes bread, rolls and confectionery as they please.
 
The rooms were spotlessly clean. We had a nice, large and bright room. The rooms are very modern in design. The towels are changed every day. The beds were excellent. Despite the fact that our room faced the street, it was pleasantly quiet and there was little traffic noise.
Every day there was a bottle of water for each person without charge. There was also a Nespresso machine with coffee available. The room had a large shower.
A small wellness area and a fitness room are available on the first floor.
The hotel is very centrally located. Many attractions are in the immediate vicinity. La Ramblas is two minutes walk. Many cafes, restaurants and shops nearby.
If we are in Barcelona again we will book this top hotel again! We had a very nice short vacation and would love to come back.",5,2024,04,01
23,Top 👍,"SUPER HOTEL in a central location with great service!

23,Birthday weekend at Ohla Barcelona!!,"I celebrated my birthday in Barcelona with friends and I was very positively surprised by the experience team. We received an upgrade and a beautiful room. There were birthday greetings in all kinds of forms, balloons, chocolates, a bottle of champagne, etc. Overall, we were treated very warmly and received great tips for the area and restaurants. The hotel is in a super central location. The terrace with the great view is unique. The breakfast is excellent! I will definitely be back.",5,2024,01,29
23,My best 5 star hotel so far,"The Ohla Hotel Barcelona impressed with its immaculate cleanliness, extremely friendly and helpful staff and regular room service with fresh water. Breakfast offered a wide selection, from freshly squeezed juices to vegetarian and vegan options and the option to prepare eggs according to personal taste. The central location made it easy to explore. The breathtaking view from the rooftop rounded off the first-class stay.",5,2024,01,26
23,Excellent 5 star hotel in the center of Barcelona.,"Beautiful 5 star boutique hotel in the center of Barcelona. A few steps from La Rambla, Plaza de la Catalunya and all the main attractions of central Barcelona. Excellent cleanliness of the rooms and bathrooms. Very friendly and efficient service. Excellent breakfast in the morning. I will definitely go back.",5,2024,01,19
23,Great stay,"The staff is extremely attentive, friendly and helpful. The hotel with its location and roof terrace is a highlight. The room is modern and every corner has been used sensibly. The only thing that took some getting used to at our age was the open shower. But we quickly got used to it. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The fact that the hotel is in the middle of the city could not be heard in the room and the city was overcrowded. If there is anything to complain about here, it is the breakfast. The choice of toppings was very one-sided and the slices of bread were simply too thick for our standards. In summary: we were completely satisfied and would gladly come back.",4,2023,12,11

23,A great city hotel,"The whole family was there in May, and the experience was very good. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are very nice, the service exceptional. Breakfast is very good. It has a pool and a bar at the top of the hotel, and the only drawback is that it is open to people outside the hotel and has a lot of people, so in the afternoon it is usually full after 6pm.
The reception staff treated us great.",5,2023,08,17

23,TOP HOTEL in zentraler LAGE !!!,"Das Hotel Ohla befindet sich direkt im Herzen Barcelonas (Stadtzentrum). 
Vieles ist zu Fuß erreichbar. Das gesamte Hotelpersonal ist sehr höflich, kompetent und zuvorkommend. Javi und Zak sprechen Deutsch und waren wie alle anderen immer sehr hilfsbereit.

Das Zimmer wird 2x täglich gereinigt. Frühstück war für uns Vegetarier mehr als zufriedenstellend.

Toller Rooftop mit einem einzigartigen Rundblick über die Stadt Barcelona.
Leider waren zum Zeitpunkt unseres Aufenthaltes direkt vor dem Hotel Straßenbauarbeiten im Gange, die doch einen gewissen Lärm verursachten und sicherlich noch eine gewisse Zeit in Anspruch nehmen.

Zusammengefasst ist das Hotel OHLA sehr zu empfehlen. Danke dem gesamten Ohla-Team für den angenehmen und tollen Aufenthalt!!!",5,2023,07,10

23,Ein wunderbarer Ort in Barcelona! Wir können es uneingeschränkt empfehlen.,"Das Hotel wird seinen Ansprüchen vollkommen gerecht. Gleich zu Beginn gibt es ein warmes Willkommen und man fühlt sich angekommen. 
Die Zimmer sind modern ausgestattet und man kann sehr gut auf den Matrazen schlafen. Insgesamt ist im Hotel viel Kunst zu entdecken. Es hat eine ganz wunderbare Lage nahe am zentralen Platz de Catalonia und dem wunderbaren Viertel El Born. 
Vor dem Hotel befindet sich derzeit eine Baustelle mit Straßenarbeiten. Hiervon war in keiner Weise etwas mitzubekommen. Es war ruhige d hat uns nicht gestört. 
Das Frühstück ist wirklich toll mit Köstlichkeiten aus allen Bereichen. Der Müsli Anteil könnte sich noch erhöhen, das ist aber klagen auf hohem Niveau. Toll ist natürlich auch die Rooftop Bar! 
Sehr zuvorkommend bleibt und der Page Zack in Erinnerung. Immer freundlich, hilfsbereit und mit gepflegtem Smalltalk unterwegs. Wir würden immer wieder kommen.",5,2023,03,17
23,Hotel TOP!,"Estuvimos en este hotel un finde de semana para celebrar nuestro aniversario.
Es un hotel boutique en el centro de Barcelona con una atención extremadamente personalizada, desde que cruzas la puerta.
Nos recibió el Mayordomo Javier y nos acompañó hasta donde se realiza el checking privado, en la planta 1.
Servicio muy rápido y profesional poniendo todo tipo de facilidades para sentirnos como en casa.
La habitación, en nuestro caso fue la suite: moderna, amplia con mucha luz, bonito diseño y buena distribución, la cama muy comoda con menu de almohadas y olor personalizado.
Nos encontramos con la primera sorpresa, un precioso ramo de flores preparado por Alba (de equipo de Guest Experience) y con una botella de cava de bienvenida.
Durante toda nuestra estancia todo el personal ha estado muy pendiente de nosotros sin ser intrusivos. Se nota qué realizan su trabajo de manera honesta y con pasión.
Ahí no terminaron las sorpresas, día siguiente nos sorprendieron con servicio de preparación de baño (algo que recomendamos a todos los huéspedes).
Y para poner el broche de oro en nuestra estancia, nos sorprendieron el último día subiéndonos el desayuno a la habitación.
Queríamos destacar especialmente la atención por parte de Saul, Alba y Javier y dar las gracias de todo corazón a Ana, directora del Hotel.
Sin su buen hacer todo esto no hubiera sido posible.
Si tenéis previsto celebrar algún acontecimiento como cumpleaños o aniversario,  sin duda ninguna no vais a encontrar mejor lugar para realizarlo.
Nunca hemos estado en un hotel con la atención tan detalladamente personalizada y cercana.

La sera della vigilia ha bussato alla nostra porta Babbo Natale in persona 😂 e ha portato dei regalini! Hanno reso la nostra permanenza a Barcellona ancora più bella!",5,2023,01,11
23,Un hotel que amerita volver! ,"Estuve por 4 noches en este hotel y fue fantástico. Excelente la ubicación, tiene una estación de metro casi al frente y la mayoría de lugares turísticos están muy cerca, se puede ir caminando. La atención de todo el personal es maravillosa, una de las noches que nos hospedamos fue año nuevo por lo que nos obsequiaron una botella de champagne y chocolates para el brindis. El desayuno muy bueno y con buen horario. Y la terreza es un lugar muy agradable, con una vista fantástica. ",5,2023,01,08

Avise al hotel a las 20:30 cuando salía a cenar, cuando volví seguía estropeado sin solución de arreglo a media noche. 

Al día siguiente las soluciones ofrecidas eran un misero descuento de 15euros, no tenían hojas de reclamaciones que son obligatorias por ley …

Claramente no merece las 5*. He estado en muchos hoteles de muchas menos estrellas donde la atención al cliente ha sido infinitamente mejor (y por supuesto tenían agua para lavarse los dientes)",1,2022,11,09
23,Luxuriöser Rückzugsort mit tollem Service  und Persönlichkeit in Bestlage!,Wir haben das Boutique-Hotel aufgrund seiner Lage und der bisherigen Bewertungen für unseren 4-tägigen Kurztripp nach Barcelona gewählt.

23,Grossartiges Hotel!,"Die perfekte Lage im Zentrum von Barcelona macht dieses Hotel ideal für einen Städtetrip. Aber nicht nur die Lage überzeugt, sondern auch Zimmer und Service. Innen ist das Hotel stylish, hochwertig und komfortable, die Betten sind superbequem und trotz dass unser Zimmer strassenseitig lag, war vom Verkehr kaum etwas zu hören. Die Mitarbeiter:innen waren alle aussergewöhnlich freundlich und zuvorkommend. Ein Highlight ist definitiv die Dachterrasse mit Blick über die Stadt; wir haben immer einen Platz bekommen und haben die Aussicht und Cocktails sehr genossen. Das Einzige, was noch verbessert werden könnte, ist das Frühstück, das einem sonst 5 Sterne-Hotel nicht ganz angemessen ist (Kaffeemaschine war kaputt, Eivariationen nur widerwillig und auf Nachfrage serviert). Diese minimalen Mängel macht dieses Hotel mit allem anderen aber absolut wett.",5,2022,07,25

Das Zimmer war immer super sauber.",3,2022,04,24
23,Buen hotel en el centro,"Nos hemos alojado en este hotel y nuestra valoración es buena. Es hotel es chulo, moderno, está muy impecable y titne una sitición immejorable.

Zu Fuß 7 Minuten zur La Rambla , 5 Minuten zum Plaza Catalunya und 15 Minuten zum Casa  Batllo.
Fenster sind nicht zu öffnen !!!
Zur Straße ziemlich laut.
Ausgesprochen nettes und hilfsbereites Personal.
Frühstück lecker - Spiegelei nicht im Angebot , aber sonst Alles vorhanden.
Zimmer stylish mit sehr harten Matratzen.
Dusche mitten im Zimmer , aber toller Wasserdruck !!
Leider Rooftop- Pool wegen Reparatur geschlossen , und Rooftop-Bar ebenfalls geschlossen da zu kalt und nass draußen.
Sternerestaurant ""Caelis"" ist einen Besuch wert - das ""kleine Menü"" Earth and Sea ist sehr lecker und im Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ausgesprochen gut.
Die Tapasbar ""La Passohla"" überzeugt weder mit Leistung noch mit Preis.",4,2022,03,14
23,Preis Leistung stimmt nicht,"Personal zum Teil sehr freundlich, zum Teil weniger (junge Mitarbeiter z.T. Sehr wortkarg. Besonders beim Frühstück)
Zimmer nett, für 5* allerdings nicht ausreichend.
Rooftop Bar wegen technischer Probleme geschlossen. Sauna wegen technischer Probleme geschlossen.
Was uns sehr geärgert hat: beim Frühstück muss man für jeden kleinen Sonderwunsch extra bezahlen. Das Buffet ist sehr basic. Alles andere ist mit zusätzlichen Kosten verbunden. Nicht einmal Pancakes sind kostenlos. Da stimmt in meinen Augen das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis nicht zusammen!
Nett, aber definitiv zu teuer für das, was geboten ist",3,2022,02,21

23,¡Planazo sin salir de la ciudad! ,"En unos tiempos donde hacer planes parece un drama, ya que las cosas cambian rápidamente decidimos organizar una “escapada de fin de semana” dentro de nuestra ciudad y elegimos este hotel porque reunía lo que buscábamos. Habitación ideal, ducha divertida, terraza perfecta y hasta un restaurante con estrella Michelin. ¡La gastronomía nos pierde! Además en este momento de restricciones el poder cenar en un restaurante es ya un lujo. 😊
Queremos destacar la atención en recepción de Jorge, que estuvo pendiente de que pudiésemos disfrutar en todo momento de la estancia. ¡Y sin duda lo hicimos! ¡Super recomendable! ",5,2021,02,09

Pues con maletas arrastrando hasta el hotel
Y llegas, y aunque tu agencia te ha reservado, pues no, y la persona en recepción, Jessi, pues ni caso y como que le da lo mismo... al

La estancia ha sido perfecta y destaco por encima de todo la atención del personal. Especial agradecimiento a Jenny y Belen de recepción y al maitre del restaurante La Plassohla (no recuerdo el nombre).
Habitación espaciosa y muy confortable. En nuestro caso una Junior Suite con excelentes vistas a Via Laietana. Amenities de lujo y se agradece la cafetera donde además tienen cápsulas biodegradables (buen gesto en la protección del medioambiente).
Cenamos en el restaurante y nos dejamos aconsejar por el maitre. Nos fue sirviendo varias tapas y hasta que le dijimos de parar. Todo buenísimo y muy buena selección de vinos y cavas.

Was ein riesen Pluspunkt für uns war, ist die absolut sensationelle Gastfreundschaft der Mitarbeiter. Alle sind sehr zuvorkommend und helfen, wo sie können. Da wir einen ganzen Tag noch auf die Fähre nach Mallorca warten mussten, machten wir ein Late Checkout, das sie uns gratis gegeben haben! Wir konnten dann gehen, wann wir wollten. Ausserdem vergassen Sie zwei Drinks auf die Rechnung zunehmen - wir machten sie darauf aufmerksam - sie schenkten uns diese zwei Drinks „aufs Haus“...das nennen wir Gastfreundschaft.
Wir kommen definitiv wieder! Herzlichen Dank

Nos quedamos en una junior suite muy cómoda espaciosa y moderna, a pesar de estar ubicada en frente a la avenida era muy silenciosa y el ruido no molestaba (4to piso). Una de las mejores cosas que tiene el Hotel es su ubicación a pasos del paseo de Gracia, El Born, La Rambla y el Gótico. Justo al lado hay un banco con ATH, al cruzar la avenida hay supermercado y farmacia, además de los restaurantes.

Un NO può essere: le finestre in camera , forse per il motivo di sicurezza, sono bloccate. La colazione è buona. Manca un po’ la varietà dei prodotti. Non a tutti può piacere la doccia tutta trasparente in stanza , nel ricompenso la stanza è di design e molto luminosa.

Mientras haces el check-in, después de un largo viaje, copa de cava, perfecto.

La habitación amplia y con una ducha de cristal a 3 bandas, curioso pero amplia y con ducha de techo, se agradece. 
El desayuno es muy bueno y con un poco de todo, ademas de tener a un cocinero por si deseas que te preparen algo al momento.

Der Empfang beim check in ist sehr freundlich und informativ das Zimmer im 6. Stock war tuhig allerdings ist die in der Mitte des Zimmer befindliche verglaste Dusche gewöhnungsbedürftig das sie keine Privatsphäre zulässt.Desweiteren ist die in der Wand versteckte Toilettentüre nachts nicht leicht zu finden.  Das Frühstück ist nicht zu empfehlen das man ungemütlich sitzt die Tische nicht richtig sauber gemacht sind und der Service nicht von sich aus fragt ob man Kaffee o.ä,möchte. Frische Semmeln sucht man vergebens und der Toaster ist nicht sehr effektiv. Eier muss man sich ebenfalls selber kochen.

El edificio que vemos se ubicó en chaflán con la Via Laietana, construido tras la apertura de la avenida. En 1935 el inmueble fue ocupado por el comercio de moda Casa Vilardell. El arquitecto Eusebi Bona llevó a cabo las obras de remodelación para albergar los grandes almacenes. Funcionaron hasta los años 1980, cuando el edificio fue transformado en una ampliación de la vecina comisaría de la Policía Nacional. En 2011 la finca fue remodelada integralmente, según un proyecto del arquitecto Luis Alonso, para albergar el hotel Ohla. Del edificio original únicamente conserva la fachada, a la que se añadió la intervención artística «Mur d'ulls» del escultor Frederic Amat, formada por un millar de globos oculares de porcelana policromados.",4,2018,11,07

Lounge ohne dass wir vom Personal angesprochen wurden, da war die Verständigung schwierig: unsere Seite rudimentäres Spanisch, er kein verständliches Englisch.
Aber CAVA ging dann doch 🙏
Der Service beim frühstücken ist dann aber noch die Steigerung: in einem 5 Sterne 
Hotel im Dreck der Vorganger auf den Banken und stühlen wie auch auf dem Fußboden zu sitzen ist wirklich ein starkes Stück.
Dafür besteht das Frühstück allerdings auch nur aus je 3 Sorten Käse und Wurst, die dafür aber schon mal gerne etwas angeschwitzt, getrocknet ob der Wärme geworden sind. Dafür waren Spiegel- und Rühreier auch am 5 Tag nicht wirklich warm. 
Kaffe uns Tee im SelfService, 2 Sorten Toast, 2 Sorten trockenes kaltes Brot, ein Dreh-Toaster, der 5min für eine Lage Toast benötigt.
Einen Weckdienst der besonderen Art stellten die Servicekräfte jeden Morgen um 08:00 dar, die irgendwo im Haus sehr geräuschvoll Tische und Stühle 5 min lang über den Boden gezogen zu haben. Das wiederholte sich dann 10min später nochmals.

Dafür erledigte das Housekeeping jeden Tag ohne besondere Aufforderung unser tägliches Zimmerchaos derart toll, dass wir mehr als angetan davon waren und das gerne und ausdrücklich loben.

Beim CheckOut hat es dann auch niemanden interessiert, ob wir zufriedenen waren, sondern es wurde nur nach dem eventuellen Verzehr aus der minibar gefragt.

Beim nächsten Bareclona Besuch steht bestimmt ein anderes 5Sterne Hotel auf dem Plan, in der Hoffnung, dass es dann wirklich 5 anstelle der gebotenen 4 Sterne sind.",3,2018,10,05
23,Alles Gut,"Das Hotel liegt perfekt um fussläufig in den Vierteln Gotico, Born, Raval, Eixample vieles zu erreichen.
Die Via Laietana an der das Hotel liegt ist stark befahren, die Zimmer aber recht gut isoliert, die U-Bahn ist aber hör und spürbar.
Unser Zimmer war sehr gross und gut ausgestattet, kein unnötiger SchnickSchnack, dafür ein grosses Bad und ein sehr bequemes Bett. Zimmer wird 2x täglich gemacht.
Nettes Personal, Concierge am Empfang sehr zuvorkommend.
Schöne Bar auf dem Dach mit Blick bis zum Meer und viele Sehenswürdigkeiten.
Preise recht hoch, allles in allem stimmt Preis/Leistung aber.",4,2018,09,29
23,"Schönes Hotel, ginge noch besser","Das Hotel liegt recht zentral in Barcelona. Mit ein bisschen Ausdauer schafft man die meisten Unternehmungen zu Fuß. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, feuchte Handtücher zur Erfrischung an einem heissen Sommertag habe ich anderswo noch nicht bekommen. Zusätzlich gab es frische Limonade. Das Zimmer entsprach nicht 100% unseren Vorstellungen eines ""Deluxe"" Zimmers. Man kam durch die Eingangstüre direkt in den Badbereich, die Dusche stand vollverglast mitten im Zimmer. Leider war eine Dichtung fehlerhaft, so dass jedes Duschen in einer kleineren Überschwemmung resultierte. An einigen weiteren Ecken und Stellen zeigt sich eine eklatant schlechte Verarbeitung, vor allem im Sanitärbereich. Teilweise musste man etwas länger auf frische Handtücher warten. Die Rooftop Bar ist ok, guter Barkeeper, sehr gute Musik, geschwommen sind wir in dem doch recht kleinen und nicht sehr sauber erscheinenden Pool nicht.",4,2018,08,29
23,Aperitivo roofTop!,"Trovato per caso, ci siamo ritrovate a fare un Aperitivo tra amiche su questo rooftop al Top! Location spettacolare, vista meravigliosa, aperitivo chic, piscina suggestiva. Personale affabile e accogliente. Merita davvero! ",5,2018,08,18
23,lindo!,"Rooftop muy lindo en pleno centro de Barcelona,
hay una vista increible y el citio es encantador, el personal es super prefesional y Giacomo nos trata cada vez muy bien.
Voy a menudo despues del trabajo para desconectar y siempre salgo muy contenta...

23,Eine unpraktische Augenweide: Boutique-Hotel,"Hervorragende Lage im Zentrum Barcelonas. Unsere Junior Suite Deluxe war geräumig aber unpraktisch. Dusche im Halbdunkel, nur zwei Mini-Halogenlämpchen in der Decke. WC-Eingang muss ertastet werden, da Türe nicht ersichtlich weil in Wand eingebracht. Waschbecken futuristisch und klein. Die Böden nahe der sanitären Einrichtungen werden zwangsläufig nass... Toller Ausblick von der Dach-Bar mit Mini-Pool und Sitzecken.
Bier aber dafür 10 Euro... (es sagt niemand was, wenn man seine eigenen Getränke nach oben bringt).
Dank der Lage und dem ordentlichen Service jederzeit zu empfehlen.",4,2018,08,08
23,Empfehlenswertes Hotel in Barcelona,"Wir waren für 3 Nächte im Hotel Ohla und haben uns super wohlgefühlt. Die Zimmer sind schön, modern eingerichtet. Wir hatten ein Zimmer zur Seitenstraße und damit sehr ruhig. Die Betten sind großartig. Eine schöne Rooftopbar mit Pool, ein wenig klein, aber zum erfrischen reicht es unbedingt. Das Personal ist superfreundlich und hilfsbereit.
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist ok, wenngleich die Spiegeleier leider immer kalt waren, aber es gab ja genug anders.Besonders hervorheben möchte ich den Service beim Empfang und den exzellenten Service des Concierges, ein schönes Hotel wunderbar gelegen sehr zu empfehlen, wir kommen sicher wieder zurück.",5,2018,07,24
23,Toller Rooftop-Pool,"Wir sind um ca. Mitternacht angekommen. Concierge hat uns freundlich empfangen und uns gleich zur Reception begleitet. Eduardo an der Reception hat uns Cava und Süssigkeiten offeriert, wir fühlten uns sehr willkommen. Das Design-Zimmer 105 war sauber, aber ich fand es sehr dunkel und wegem dem kleinen Fenster erdrückend. Die ägyptische Baumwoll-Bettwäsche und das Kissenangebot waren dafür ein Traum. Da das Zimmer gleich an der Hauptstrasse liegt und die U-Bahn untendurch fährt, haben wir (trotz Ohrenstöpsel) die drei Tage gar nicht gut geschlafen. Die Dachterrasse mit Pool und Bar fanden wir am Besten. Ich war ein bisschen enttäuscht, dass es keine Liegestühle gab, wie ich es auf den Bewertungsfotos gesehen hatte, aber dafür hatten wir Glück und fanden jedes Mal in einer Lounge Platz und konnten ein bisschen relaxen und den Schlaf nachholen. Service war super nett und die Drinks teuer, aber für diese Aussicht zahlt man gerne ein bisschen mehr. Frühstück war okay, aber für ein 5-Sterne Hotel würde man jedoch mehr erwarten. Ich würde empfehlen auswärts zu Frühstücken, bei der super guten Lage des Hotels ist es nicht schwer, was Gutes zu finden. Ich hoffe, dass wir beim nächsten Mal ein besseres, ruhigeres Zimmer bekommen.",4,2018,07,22
23,Buena terraza,"Terracita con vista en la planta octava, no son las mejores vistas pero es muy coqueta, sobretodo por la noche con el reflejo de la piscina.
Mi pareja y yo pedimos dos bebidas y estaban muy buenas la verdad. Sí que es un poco caro pero pagas por el servicio que es muy bueno sobre todo el camarero que nos atendió Daniel, muy agradable y simpatico.
Lo recomiendo",4,2018,07,14
23,Toller Städtetrip,"Super Lage, schöne Zimmer, sehr sauber, super freundliches Personal, schöne Rooftopbar, wobei der Pool auf den Fotos deutlich größer erscheint als er dann tatsächlich ist.
Also alles gut .....
Bis auf das Frühstück, das hat kein 5 Sterneniveau - die Spiegeleier wie das Rühren waren jeden Tag kalt, das habe ich weltweit noch nicht erlebt - schade.",4,2018,06,09
23,Dieses Hotel hat was,"Es handelt sich um ein sehr interessantes Design-Hotel in absolut zentraler Lage. Top modern mit viel Liebe zum Detail. 
Fast alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fußläufig erreichbar. Ansonsten ist die U-Bahnstation direkt vor dem Hotel. Wir hatten Design-Zimmer mit sehr hochwertiger Ausstattung. Rooftop-Bar ist grandios. Sehr hilfreich ist der Concierge-Service des Hotels für die Buchung der Tickets der Sehenswürdigkeiten. Tappa-Restaurant ist ebenfalls zu empfehlen.",5,2018,06,06
23,Impresionante,"Tarde de relax y disfrute en la impresionante terraza de este hotel, servicio y vistas de 10 , ideal para relajarse y pasar un buen rato. El personal este pendiente de ti en todo momento para que todo en conjunto sea excepcional. Recomendado 100%.",5,2018,05,15
23,Tolle Lage,"Die Lage eignet sich hervorragend um die Stadt zu Fuß oder auch mit dem Fahrrad zu erkunden. In unmittelbarer Nähe befinden sich viele Sehenswürdigkeiten und empfehlenswerte Restaurants. Fast gegenüber ist die Palau de la Musica und nicht weit die Oper Gran Teatre. 

Das Hotel selbst verfügt über eine Rooftopbar mit schönem Schwimmbad; hat schöne Zimmer und eine schöne Fassade. Die Frühstück ist leider etwas lieblos. Nicht selten sind die Spiegeleier kalt etc. Leider ist die Lüftung im Frühstücksraum so eingestellt, dass es permanent zieht und ohne entsprechend warme Kleidung ein längerer Aufenthalt nicht möglich ist. 

Das Personal ist nicht professionell- jedoch bemüht.",4,2018,05,02
23,Pasqua a Barcellona,"Hotel situato in posizione ottimale, vicino alle principali attrazioni della città. Camere ampie e pulitissime dotate di ogni comfort.

23,Excelente atención y el lugar inmejorable.,"Nos hospedamos una semana en este hotel, las habitaciones son excelentes, la ubicación inmejorable y sobre todo la atención es de primera, el personal es sumamente amable sobre todo en concierge, te ayudan a que tu viaje sea la mejor experiencia posible, nos han ayudado a organizar visitas a lugares que difícilmente podríamos haberlo hecho solos, nos consiguieron reservas en restaurantes a los cuales no había podido por nuestra cuenta. Sin lugar a duda uno de los mejores lugares para quedarse en Barcelona.",5,2018,03,20

Un saludo a todo el equipo en general.",5,2018,03,16
23,Bien,"Buenas vistas, bonito hotel, gente amable, aveces un poco pesados ( terraza), cocteles servidos en plastico, que lo entiendo al ser una terraza a 16 euros.. lo encuentro excesivo... dry martini k es la mejor cocteleria de bcn tiene los cocteles a 12 euros ojo!! ",3,2018,03,12
23,Das certificat of excellence ist absolut gerechtfertigt,"Kurztrip im Dezember - geniales Hotel mit genialer Lage.

Stehts freundliches Personal - saubere Zimmer. Hatten ein Zimmer mit Frühstück - Büffet sehr gut - leider wurde für das Omelett ein Aufpreis verrechnet - war bei den vergangengen Aufenthalten nicht so (war schon mehrmals dort)

Nichts destotrotz ist das Hotel eine klare Empfehlung",5,2018,03,04
23,Comida excelente,"Si uno se da un paseo por el centro de barcelona y le apetece comer bien, realmente bien, con una relación calidad precio excelente , no dejar de visitar la parte de restaurante “normal” del hotel. Buenísimo trato, y mejor comida a un precio correctisimo. Un menú sensacional.",5,2018,02,25
23,Tutto molto bello,"Ci siamo soffermati per 4 giorni e devo dire che è stato quasi tutto perfetto! Tutto il personale è stato molto cordiale, gentile e disponibile. Stanze meravigliose e molto romantiche. Colazione deliziosa. Unica pecca: le stanze ci sono state assegnate solo dopo le 15... per il resto nulla da dire! Vale la pena aspettare😉",5,2018,01,10

Ottima la camera, spaziosa e pulitissima (ci mancherebbe) con doccia a vista (figata!).
Sul tetto piscina e lounge bar a disposizione.
Ottimo il servizio di concierge che ci ha permesso di lasciare le valige l'ultimo giorno tutta la giornata in albergo ed avremmo avuto la possibilità, in un'apposita camera, di fare una doccia prima di prendere il volo di ritorno della sera.
Sicuramente ci torneremo.",5,2017,11,16
23,5 Sterne Hotel mit Abstrichen,"Dass 5 Sterne Hotel ist sauber und dass Personal freundlich. Die Lage ist wirklich genial für Ausflüge jedweder Art oder einfach um dass Abend und Nachtleben zu genießen! Leider fährt unter dem Hotel die Straßenbahn in der U-Bahn und der Donner bzw. dass Grollen der Bahn ist zumindest in unserer Junior Suite 108 gut zu hören gewesen. Ohne Oropax ist schlafen schwierig. Dass Zimmer ist riesig aber gerade in den Waschräumen mit schwarzen Fliesen und Wänden sehr dunkel gehalten. Die Lichtverhältnisse sind sehr schlecht! In der Dusche war die Brause an der Decke defekt und es Spritze alles an die Decke. Die Duschtüre schließt nicht bündig ab und Wasser spritzt nach draußen. Es gibt in der Dusche ein kleines Licht, was zum Duschen so gerade ausreischt, gleiches gilt an der Badewanne. Dass Licht am Bett funktionierte nicht. Ansonsten war die Suite geräumig und einem 5 Sterne Hotel entsprechend, aber eben nicht mit deutschem Standard zu vergleichen. Die Dachterasse ist sensationell mit einem Aquarium Pool aber gesalzenen Preisen (Bier 6,00 €). Dass Frühstücksbüffet ist ausreichend, aber nicht üppig oder abwechselnd, es gibt jeden Tag exakt das Gleiche Angebot. Zum Michelin Sterne Restaurant kann ich nichts sagen da wir dort nicht gegessen haben. 285,00 € pro Nacht/Suite ist extrem teuer und wird den Ansprüchen auch im Hinblick auf dass übersichtliche Frühstück nicht gerecht. Aber: wir würden wieder kommen!",3,2017,11,08
23,Cocktails y vistas impresionantes en la terraza ,"He acudido a la terraza, ya llevaba tiempo con ganas de ver sus vistas, y ha superado con creces mis expectativas.
El trato de Luis, el barman, muy profesional y exquisito, las vistas, la decoración, el ambiente, la música de fondo... todo ha contribuido a una gran experiencia. Volveré, sin dudarlo. ",5,2017,11,04
23,Perfektes Hotel mit super Lage,"Die wunderschöne Dachterrasse mit kleinem Schwimmbecken und Bar auf der 8ten Etage verfügt über eine tolle Aussicht über Barcelona. Sehr freundliches und hilfsbereite Personal, das sehr schöne Zimmer mit einer Glasdusche in der Mitte vom Raum war umwerfend. Am Frühstück ist nichts auszusetzen. Die Lage des Hotels ist perfekt wenn man gerne Sehenswürdigkeiten wie die Altstadt, die Kathedrale oder die Fussgängerzone besucht. Auch die La Rambla ist in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen. Mit gutem Gewissen kann man das Ohla weiter empfehlen.",5,2017,10,07
23,Spitzenhotel im Zentrum von Barcelona,"Wir haben uns zum Anlaß von meinem Geburtstag hier ein verlängertes Wochenende gegönnt. Das Hotel Ohla ist ein sehr modern gestaltetes und eingerichtetes Hotel. Im Eingangsbereich befindet sich nur der Concierge. Der Check-In/Out befindet sich im Zwischengeschoß einen Stock höher. Zu Stoßzeiten kann es hier leider schon eine Weile dauern - bei uns hat der Check-In fast 30 Minuten gedauert - das läßt noch ordentlich Luft nach oben!
Die Zimmer sind sehr modern und geräumig - sehr gut ausgestattet und teils etwas futuristisch beleuchtet. Die Aufzüge sind etwas lahm was ab und an etwas nervt. Das Frühstück ist sehr reichhaltig und wird in den Räumen des Restaurants serviert. Es wird auch bis zum Schluß nachgelegt. Das Service ist auf Zack und der Kaffee sehr lecker. 

Absolut zu empfehlen ist die Roof-Top-Bar wo man auf dem Dach des Hotels mit gutem Blick über die Stadt am Abend leckere (teure) Cocktails schlürfen kann. Der hauseigene Pool befindet sich vor der Bar und ist von 3 Seiten her wie ein Aquarium verglast. Was die größe des Pools anbelangt sollte man sich nicht von den Bildern teuschen lassen - das ist nur eine Pfütze und mit zwei Zügen schwimmt man von Seite zu Seite.

Ein Aufenthalt im Ohla ist ein teures Vergnügen, aber die Spitzenlage mit U-Bahn direkt vor der Tür oder auch der Plaza de Catalunya nur wenige Geh-Minuten entfernt, sowie die Ausstattung der Zimmer und das tolle Frühstück rechtfertigt den Preis.",5,2017,10,05
23,Spitzenhotel für die Erkundung Barcelonas,"Das Ohla ist unserer Meinung nach, das Beste Hotel um in Ruhe Barcelona zu erkunden. Es ist ein wahrer Ruhepol mitten in der hektischen Stadt. Die Isolierung ist extrem gut, so dass kaum Außengeräusche ins Zimmer dringen. Der Service ist stets Aufmerksam und unaufdringlich. Außerdem ist es keine Bettenburg - je Etage gibt es maximal ca. 12 Zimmer. Die Ausstattung ist Phänomenal: Auf dem Dach, eine der schönsten Dachterassen in ganz Barcelona, inkl. Cabanas und Infinity-Glaspool. Tagsüber zum Sonnen - abends als Chill-out Lounge genutzt, bietet sie einen Überblick über die ganze Stadt. Die Zimmer sind groß und zum Wohlfühlen gemacht. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist gut, wenn auch nicht groß. Alles was man vermisst, kann man jedoch bestellen. 
Die Lage spricht ebenfalls für das Hotel: ca. 500 m zu den Ramblas - 900 m ins Barri Gotic. Man kann von hier den größten Teil der Stadt zu Fuß erkunden. Sollte man das nicht wollen, so hat man unweit des Hotels die Metro oder kann direkt davor ein Taxi nehmen - Perfekt.
Besonders hervorheben möchte ich an dieser Stelle den Concierge: Albert.
Dieser spricht viele unterschiedliche Sprachen, so auch deutsch fließend. Dadurch haben auch Gäste ohne gute Englischkenntnisse immer einen Ansprechpartner haben. Außerdem ist er eine Seele von Mensch - immer aufmerksam und nett, stets hilfsbereit und er findet immer eine Lösung.
Alles in allem: Das Ohla ist eine Adresse um die man in Barcelona nicht herumkommt.",5,2017,09,22
23,Perfektes Hotel,"Dieses Hotel überzeugt hinsichtlich Service, Gastfreundschaft, Infrastruktur, sehr gute Betten, Sauberkeit. Das Frühstück ist sehr vielfältig. Die Lage des Hotels könnte nicht besser sein. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten wie Markthallen, Kathedrale, Fussgängerzone der Altstadt, La Rambla, etc. befinden sich in unmittelbarer Nähe.",5,2017,09,17
23,Bonita terraza para tomar algo,"Hemos venido a la terraza de este hotel, motivados por el calor asfixiante y una búsqueda rápida en google de terrazas en Barcelona.

Es una pequeña y acogedora terraza, con bonitas vistas, pequeños espacios agradables donde tomar algo por unos 14 euros  (mojito) aproximadamente con música agradable y no muy fuerte

Todo ha ido espectacular, excepto en el momento de pagar que han hecho una cosa muy rara y algo molesta para nosotros. Han juntado todo en una única nota, a pesar de decirles que pagaríamos por separado, y luego han dicho que solo podían cobrar 3 transacciones por tiquet...pagando en metálico!, lo cual nos ha hecho hacer ingeniería financiera entre los amigos para poder pagar con este estrambótico sistema.

Una lástima, pues es un punto negativo para una experiencia que podria haber sido perfecta.",4,2017,08,04
23,Fantástica experiencia,"El hotel está muy bien situado a pocos minutos del barrio histórico, de las Ramblas, de la Plaza de Catalunya y del Paseo de Gracia. La decoración es muy moderna y de muy buen gusto. Las habitaciones espaciosas, limpias y con todos los servicios necesarios.

23,WOW,"Angefangen beim Service beim Einchecken bis zu der Putzequippe, einfach der Hammer. 

Herzlichen Dank an den Service in der Tapas Bar und für die nette Geste.

Die Zimmer sind sehr stillvoll eingerichtet mit tollen Lichteffekten. Die Poolbar ist der absolute Hammer, Infinitypool über die Dächer von Barcelona. Im Allgemeinen auch gutes Preis/Leistung!

Einzig das Parking ist sehr teuer, bei Onlinebuchung auf der Homepage des Hotels inkl Promocode muss dies nicht bezahlt werden.",5,2017,07,20

La sala del desayuno es realmente pequeña para el numero de personas  donde las mesitas tienen una separación de 50 cm. es que si te levantes del banco fijo a la pared tienes que disculparte por rosar con el vecino  de la mesa de al lado esto no corresponde  a su categoría. Por cierto el desayuno aunque muy apretados tiene un jamon salado muy bueno, no asi el jamon york, unos croisants bonísimos pero huevos ?? revueltos harinosas. una selécion de fruta fresca que es de agradecer. conclusion consideramos precio calidad(comodidad) nada bueno mas bien excesivo",3,2017,04,26
23,"Tolles Hotel, super Lage! ","Wir waren für ein Wochenende im ohla Barcelona und wären am liebsten länger geblieben! Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und kümmert sich gut um einen. Die Zimmer waren groß genug und schön eingerichtet. Das Bett war sehr gemütlich! Da das Hotel mitten in der Stadt liegt, hört man natürlich etwas vom Straßenlärm. Es ist jedoch an dich sehr gut isoliert. Zudem ist es abends so dunkel im Zimmer, dass man nichts von draußen mitbekommt. 
Die Dachterasse ist sehr schön gestaltet. Der Pool ist nicht beheizt, im Sommer aber sicherlich eine willkommene Abkühlung. Alles in allem ist das Hotel super gelegen für einen Städtetrip. Zwischendurch kann man immer wieder zurück ins Hotel und die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß gut zu erreichen! Das WLAN ist kostenlos und auch sehr gut. Vom Flughafen aus gelangt man schnell und unkompliziert mit dem Aerobus, der ganz in der Nähe hält, ins Hotel. Wir kommen gerne wieder!! ",5,2017,04,02
23,"In vielem erstklassig, in Kleinigeiten Optimierungsbedarf","Tolle Lage, zentral und verkehrstechnisch perfekt gelegen. Sehr umfassender Service (Zimmerreinigung zwei mal am Tag, eine Flasche Wasser jeden Tag umsonst, Süßigkeit und Wetterbericht abends auf dem Kopfkissen). Zimmer topmodern, perfekt in Ordnung und sehr komfortabel. Schade, dass so ein Hotel keine richtige, repräsentative Lobby hat. Check-in und Check-out ist in einer kleinen Zwischenetage, irgendwie unpassend.

Das einzige, was nicht so optimal war, ist m.E. das Frühstück. Für ein 5-Sterne-Hotel wünsche ich mir etwas mehr und ausgefallenere Auswahl von allem und eine Kaffespezialitätenmaschine. Zwar kann man Kaffespezialitäten individuell bestellen, anders wäre es aber einfacher. In absolutem Widerspruch zu allem war die Tatsache, dass die ausladenden Fensterbänke im Restaurant gänzlich ungeputzt waren, der Staub sammelte sich dort millimeterdick. Fraglich, warum das keiner merkt bzw. putzt.
Schön hingegen die Dachterasse mit Pool und Ausblick. Schade wiederum, dass ich bei der Abreise relativ knapp abgefertigt wurde und nicht gefragt wurde, wie mein Aufenthalt war.",4,2017,03,31

Il divano un po' troppo ingombrante

Colazione scarna
Camera rumorosissima al punto che abbiamo chiesto in cambio non riuscendo a dormire, ma anche al sesto piano.
Pregio assoluto, la grande cortesia del personale tutto, in primo luogo dello staff concierge.
Decisamente buona la posizione.

23,Top Lage für die Städtereise,"Zur Erkundung von Barcelona sehr gut gelegen. Wir hatten Mitte Januar 2017 über Lufthansa Holidays 3 Nächte in einer Juniorsuite in der oberen Etage (wichtig) gebucht. Tolle Ausstattung, Allerdings sollte man sich dies gönnen, denn die Lage nach vorne ist schöner aber auch die Straße ein wenig zu hören. Wir sind empfindlich und konnten dennoch sehr gut schlafen. Es gab den Cava im Zimmer, wie vereinbart, am Anreisetag und selbst der folgende Geburtstag wurde mit einer tollen Flasche Wein (Geschenk des Hauses) nicht vergessen. Einer der Concierge spricht sehr gut Deutsch und hilft sehr gut weiter, sehr freundlich. An einem Abend haben wir die Tapas im Hotel - Restaurant gegessen, ganz toll gemacht. In der Umgebung gibt es eine katalanische Tapas-Kette das Orio, eine Empfehlung.

23,buona esperienza,"Barcelona è fantastica, bei posti da visitare, ottimo clima e grande cibo.
Veniamo all'hotel: in ottima posizione per visitare la città.
All'ingresso c'è la congierge e non la reception...un po' strano. Poi la reception è al piano rialzato. 
Non mi piace troppo che non ci sia una hall con qualche divano, angolo lettura o zona relax...del resto è un 5 stelle. Invece al piano terra hanno inserito un cocktail bar sulla destra e un ristorante sulla sinistra...non lo trovo molto sensato...il ristorante è moderno con la cucina a vista e un grande bancone...perchè non fare lì anche il cocktail bar? che darebbe più vita anche al ristorante rendendolo meno freddo e più movimentato e darebbe poi spazio per ricavare una hall di ingresso....ok tutte considerazioni architettoniche...ma questo mi è rimasto come esperienza dell'hotel..
Le camere: minimaliste, ben arredate, moderne, tutto ok se ti piace quel genere..con bagno a vista come va di moda adesso ma non a tutti piace e comunque abbastanza piccola la camera per essere un 5 stelle.
All'ultimo piano terrazza con piscina e bar...simpatico e di effetto
Staff: gentili e di aiuto. Bravo Miguel della congierge, con i suoi consigli su come muoversi a Barcelona. Grazie al direttore, Javier, che ci ha offerto un ottima bottiglia di Cava.
Pulizie: buono. Insonorizzazione: ero al 5 piano e lì era ok, ma immagino anche ai piani più bassi dato che la struttura è molto recente e ben ristrutturata.
Colazione: buona, con scelta sia di dolce che di salato, frutta fresca, e tutto il resto per un 5 stelle, caffè, cappuccino, ecc, Il primo giorno in sala colazioni però c'era solo una persona a servire...non so, mi sembrava un po' poco, anche se devo dire che il servizio era comunque veloce e puntuale.",4,2016,11,02
23,Un posto da sogno...,"Perfetto. Una parola per racchiudere il tutto. Posizione, servizio, camera, pulizia, spazi comuni: eccezionali. Terrazza panoramica con piscina, incantevole. Colazione variegata e di ottima qualità. Abbiamo cenato svariate volte in hotel e confermo quanto fin ora detto. Ricordo ancora il polpo su letto di patate, squisitoooo!!",5,2016,11,01
23,Bar eccellente e di gran gusto estetico,"Passeggiando prima di andare a cena ci siamo imbattuti nella ""vetrina"" del bar di questo albergo e non siamo riusciti a non entrarci e ordinare 2 giri di cocktail... a dir poco eccellenti e anche Ines - la bartender - è stata estremamente cortese e disponibile. Andateci e non ne rimarrete delusi.",5,2016,10,02
23,Ottimo hotel!,"Ho soggiornato in questo fantastico hotel per 4 notti in una bellissima junior suite deluxe dall'arredamento minimal e moderno come piace a me. 
Il personale di tutto l'hotel si è sempre rivelato molto gentile e disponibile, la terrazza era meravigliosa anche solo per prende un caffè e godersi la fantastica vista, l'arredamento generale dell'hotel molto d'effetto! 
La colazione era abbastanza ricca e il ristorante di sera prepara ottime tapas, forse le migliori che io abbia mangiato a Barcellona. 
Forse l'unica nota dolente riguarda il rumore del traffico proveniente dalla strada per le stanze che vi si affacciano, nonostante i doppi vetri. Ma penso che più di quanto è stato fatto non si possa fare.
Penso che sia un'ottima scelta per chi decide di andare a Barcellona ed inoltre ho trovato prezzi veramente competitivi rispetto alla concorrenza! Non è un 5 stelle caro rispetto ad altri che si trovano a Barcellona! 
Grazie a tutto lo staff!

23,Perfekter Aufenthalt … und zwei Tipps,"Was soll man sagen…es war einfach perfekt. Das Hotel beeindruckt von A-Z. Die tollen Suiten, mit Ihren bis zum Boden gehenden Fenstern, die den Räumen das gewisse Etwas verleihen, das allgemeine Design, der Boutique-Character, das Restaurant, das unglaubliche Pool mit seiner coolen Dachterrasse/Bar/tollen Ausblick am Dach (keine Sorge, auch wenn diese eher klein geraten ist, findet sich immer ne Liege oder Lounge) oder der unserer Meinung nach perfekten Lage. Zwei kleine Tipps am Rande: Wenn sie ins Zentrum spazieren, nützen sie gleich die erste, rechte Gasse Richtung „Ramblas“. Dort finden sie nette Tapas Läden, Restaurants, einen Starbucks für Coffee to go, einen supertollen Bio Eisladen (ein MUSS!), kleine Supermärkte, Bäckerein, etc…, und gelangen nach ca 200m auf eine der größten Einkaufsstrassen Barcelonas! Und falls Sie wie wir mit Kind reisen, besuchen Sie nebst den üblichen Seehenswürdigkeiten vielleicht mal den sehr zentral liegenden ZOO (nache Strand), echt einen Besuch wert! Wir freuen uns jetzt schon auf den nächsten Aufenthalt: denn wenn Barcelona, dann nur mehr im Ohla :-)!",5,2016,09,12
23,Alternativa ,"Hotel situato in ottima posizione centrale per visitare tutto quello che si può a Barcellona. Arredamento design domina il nero forse non è da tutti, per noi è il nostro colore preferito. Il personale molto gentile e disponibile. ",5,2016,09,08
23,"Ottimo Albergo, piscina ottima, ma...","L'albergo è posizionato in una zona centrale  ed equidistante da tutti i punti di attrazione. Le camere con arredamento moderno, pulite e il servizio in camera perfetto. La piscina meravigliosa !!! Colazione ottima. Concierge perfetta e il personale molto disponibile. Rapporto qualita/prezzo ottimo. Unico aspetto negativo è il servizio bagagli, in quanto ce le siamo portate da soli e non capisco il motivo di togliere questo servizio in un albergo a 5 stelle. Voto complessivo 8,5",4,2016,08,31
23,SENCILLAMENTE SENSACIONAL,"El trato es exquisito, la comida espectacular, las vistas desde la terraza te envuelven de tal manera que no quieres hacer nada más, el personal te atiende con una amabilidad que muchos hoteles de cinco estrellas deberían de copiar y en general tanto el servicio, la calidad, precio y la estancia ha sido excelente. Yo viajo demasiado, más de lo que quisiera y suelo alojarme en hoteles de la misma categoría y este se ha llevado la palma en cuanto a excelencia, más le valdría alguna cadena aprender lo que realmente es un cinco estrellas o un GL, porque este tiene categoría para lo segundo y es humilde y no se excede, para que muchos más puedan disfrutar de sus placeres. Como vamos semana al mes a BCN este será nuestro hotel de referencia. El único consejo es, que han de dejar más jabón en el baño que el que dejan es justo para una estancia de dos días y los que vamos a semana se nos queda algo ""corto"". Sensacional. GRACIAS por tan buena estancia.",5,2016,08,28
23,Pessimo hotel!!,"Pessimo hotel. Siamo usciti stamani alle 8.00 e quando siamo tornati (alle 17.00 !!) letti ancora disfatti e camere come le avevamo lasciate.

Auch das Frühstück und Lunch oder Abendessen absolut zu empfehlen.",5,2016,05,22
23,nicht bereut,"super Lage, Personal freundlich, Design sehr ansprechend aber in der Ausführung Mängel in Lichtgestaltung (unpraktische Kombinationen der Lichtschaltung) nur 1 Steckdose in Juniorsuite, Sauberkeit im Zimmer nur mittelmässig (im Bad gab es Nischen voller Staub), Betten hervorragend und sauber, Fenster nicht zu öffnen, dadurch nur Klimaanlagengefilterte Luft und permanente Geräusche der Anlage, Espressomaschine und gratis Kapseln im Zimmer. 
Da durch vorheriges Telefonat ein Eintrag gemacht wurde dass es sich um ein Geburtstagsgeschenk handelte, stand eine Flasche Extra Brut auf dem Zimmer.
Wir wollten auf dem Zimmer frühstücken und es sollte trotz der im Vorraus bezahlten 50€ nochmals 26,-pP. kosten, dh. 102,-€ für ein Frühstück für 2 Personen. Wir haben protestiert und erst bei Abreise gemerkt dass es nicht extra berechnet wurde.
Das Frühstück an sich war nicht besonders, Schinken, Käse, Marmelade und Honig in Großmarktqualität, aber das mit dem Frühstück ist ja in Spanien sowieso schwierig.
Das Restaurant war geschlossen weil wohl der berühmte Koch gegangen ist. Die Tapasbar war im Frühstücksraum, die haben wir nicht probiert.
Ein Mojito auf der Poolterasse kostet 15€.",4,2016,05,22

23,"Hotel di design ""minimalista"" in posizione ideale.","L'ubicazione dell'hotel consente di raggiungere a piedi in pochi minuti  le più importanti attrazioni dello shopping e del turismo.
Hotel comodo e silenzioso. Colore predominante: il nero ovunque, eccessivo. Servizio efficiente, senza fronzoli. Staff gentile ed efficiente. Prima colazione e pasti di buon livello, ma non ""super"" come la categoria farebbe immaginare. Camera splendida, per vista e confort del lettone, essenziale nel suo design minimalista. Zona bagno poco funzionale.",5,2016,04,25

23,Hotel espectacular con la mejor ubicación en Barcelona ,"Un hotel fantástico, desde el servicio hasta la decoración. 
La ubicación espectacular, a metros del Barrio Gótico y de la Plaza de Cataluña.
Tienen un hermoso bar. La suites son preciosas, con vista al exterior, amplias, con todas las comodidades que uno puede esperar;  cafetera, calentador electrico para agua y una amplia gama de amenities. Todo lo mencionado  y mucho más, hacen que uno pueda sentirse cómodo como en su propia casa.
La atención del personal es espectacular, hacen de todo para agradar al huesped, te llaman a preguntar si necesitas algo, a la tarde te ofrecen nuevas toallas y limpieza.
Super recomendado este hermoso lugar! !!!!",5,2016,03,19
23,Excelente ,"Moderno, cómodo, chic hotel estilo boutique con perfecta ubicación en el puro centro del casco antiguo de Barcelona. La atención es tan buena que hace la estadía perfecta. Cuenta con servicio de parqueo a 36 euros por día, lo que al inicio nos pareció caro, pero después al comparar con otros parques no lo es. 
La terraza es simplemente espectacular. Ni hablar de la piscina. Aunque fuera invierno hay que ir a verla. 
El hotel cuenta con detalles de cinco estrellas, sin embargo le pongo 4 porque no tiene las dimensiones de un 5 estrellas, y no nos permitieron abrir la ventana hacia el balcón. Si pudiera, les pondría 4,5.  Un lugar formidable. ",4,2016,02,28
23,Buen servicio,"El trato excelente. Entraron por error en la habitación para limpiar con el cartel de no molestar y a cambio nos regalaron el desayuno. Fue el único fallo de nuestra estancia y lo subsanaron de manera elegante. El WIFI era muy bueno y potente, y gratis, no como en otros hoteles que para tener un buen WIFI te hacen pagar.",4,2016,02,21
23,Familienwochenende,"Zum zweiten Mal haben wir das Ohla-Hotel für unseren Barcelona-Besuch gebucht.

Wir können dieses Hotel vorbehaltlos empfehlen. Mitten in der Stadt, direkt an den den angesagtesten Shopping-Areas, sowie den Hot-Spots.

Angenehmer Service, tolles Essen und stets zuvorkommendes Personal.

Das Hotel ist stylisch, jung und modern. Eine Rooftopbar-Bar mit einzigartigem Blick über die Dächer Barcelonas. Die Zimmer sind modern und reduziert, sauber und sehr stylish. Einfach toll!

WE will be back! Uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen für Gäste, die den modernen Stil mögen.

Die Bar ist wirklich einzigartig mit fantastischen Drinks.

Alles in allem ein Top-Hotel.

23,Weekend da 6 stelle! Semplicemente perfetto!,"Ho soggiornato una notte con la mia ragazza per il weekend di San Valentino. A 3 minuti da piazza Catalunya e dalla Rambla, questo hotel é comodissimo per raggiungere tutti i luoghi d'interesse della città. Camera stupenda e pulitissima. Cura dei dettagli elevata. Alle 20 ci hanno chiamato in camera per sapere se era tutto ok e se volevamo che ci riordinassero la camera mentre eravamo fuori a cena. Quando siamo rientrati era tutto in ordine e pulito, con tanto di salviette pulite! Colazione ottima con un ricco buffet anche cucinato al momento. Consigliatissimo! Ci torneremo sicuramente!",5,2016,02,16
23,"5 stelle di classe, design, servizio e posizione.","Soggiornare in questo albergo è come avere un alloggio di extra lusso nel cuore della città: a piedi si arriva praticamente ovunque e quando si ritorna è bello rilassarsi in camere comode e ricche di comfort. L'arredo è minimalista ma funzionale e il design decisamente contemporaneo. Può non piacere ma è ineccepibile.
Non abbiamo utilizzato i ristoranti perchè Barcellona offre tantissimo per ogni tasca e con una qualità media altissima che non ha senso pranzare o cenare in un albergo.
Personale disponibilissimo e attento. Posto auto davanti all'albergo per scaricare e caricare e servizio parking. 
Terrazza con vista mozzafiato e piscina piccola ma molto scenografica.
Ottimo.",4,2016,02,12

23,Día muy especial,"Fui con mi pareja un día muy especial: a celebrar que le acababa de pedir la mano. La verdad que todo el personal súper atento y me ayudaron en todo momento a que la noche fuera inmejorable. Cuidaron todos los detalles además de ofrecernos todas las facilidades del mundo. Además las habitaciones son una pasada y muy cómodas, y que decir de la pedazo terraza con piscina que tienen en la azotea. En definitiva, 100% recomendable",5,2016,01,24
23,¡Muchas gracias!,"Wir möchten uns bei dem gesamten Team des Ohla Hotels bedanken. 
Mit ihrem Service und ihrer Aufmerksamkeit haben sie zu einem, für uns wundervollen Wochenende beigetragen.
Die Lage ist sehr zentral - Was sich aus dem Standort ergibt. 
Doch das die Zimmer den Bildern entsprechen, der Service ausgezeichnet ist, die Aussicht bezaubernd, das sieht man erst, wenn man dort ist. 
Der Ausblick von der Dachterasse über die Dächer von Barcelona muss erlebt werden. 
Das Frühstück ist ausgewählt. Nicht das übliche , gleiche, eher langweilige Angebot. Qualität geht hier vor Quantität und das ist sehr erfreulich.
 Eben wie das gesamte Hotel, nicht beliebig. 
Wir hatten einen wunderbaren Aufenthalt und wir kommen gerne wieder",5,2016,01,24
23,Fantástico trato,"Estuvimos tomando una copa en el restaurante de la planta baja mientras haciemos algo de tiempo para ir al teatro. El ambiente es muy acogedor. El maître Adrià nos atendió con un trato exquisito. Hemos decidido que volveremos, pero esta vez a alojarnos. ",5,2016,01,23
23,Los mejores cocktails de la Ciudad,"Conocemos alguna de las más destacadas cocteleras de Barcelona pero, diría que ninguna la puede superar. El nivel profesional es altísimo, la diversidad de bebidas es fantástica y el resultado de las combinaciones, excelente. Desconozco y no puedo opinar sobre el Hotel en sí ni del restaurante (qué sí voy a probar pronto) porque no he estado pero, les servicio de coctelería es de lo mejor de Barcelona",5,2015,12,31

Es ist ein kleines aber sehr feines Hotel - trendig, stylisch. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war für die gebotene Leistung durchaus okay - Zimmer sauber und lässig eingerichtet. Kleinigkeiten wie Nespresso Kapseln immer aufgefüllt oder Betten am Abend hergerichtet erwarten wir einerseits grundsätzlich von einem Haus dieser Kategorie, die Erwartungen wurden auch erfüllt. Ein paar Kleinigkeiten findet man immer - keine Stoffhandtücher am allgemeinen WC ... aber die trügen den Gesamteindruck nicht.",4,2015,10,28
23,Unbehaglich ,"Ein modernistisches Design-Hotel mit etlichen unpraktischen Details wie z.B.
Waschbecken, Lichtschalter ,Treppen, die sich kaum benutzen lassen. Lage zentral.
Empfang und Service professionell und freundlich.
Preise gehoben, vor allem im zugehörige Sternerestaurat ""Saüc"".",3,2015,10,24
23,Super-Lage,"Die Lage des Hotels ist optimal. Das Zimmer war sehr modern eingerichtet. Besonders die Glas-Dusche im Zimmer war ein Hingucker. Das Restaurant im Erdgeschoss (morgens Frühstück, mittags und abends eine Tapas-Bar) hatte morgens zuwenig Kapazität zu verzeichnen, um dem Gäste-Ansturm bestehen zu können. Das Essen war hervorragend, guter Kaffee (sehr wichtig!!) und die Fruchtsäfte waren frisch gepresst. 
Die Dach-Terrasse ist sehr schön angelegt, aber leider war es zu kalt für Drinks auf dem Dach. Wir bevorzugten die Boutique-Bar im Erdgeschoss, gegenüber von der Tapas-Bar. Die Barkeeper mixten uns sehr gute Drinks... kann man nur empfehlen. Die Concierges beim Hoteleingang waren unglaublich hilfsbereit und waren immer gleich zur Stelle, wenn man ein Anliegen hatte.
In wenigen Minuten befindet man sich in den Ramblas und das Shopping-Fieber kann ausgelebt werden :-)
Kurz zusammengefasst: ein perfektes Hotel.... wir kommen gerne jederzeit wieder",4,2015,10,20
23,Moderno Hotel % Estrellas con excelente ubicaciony servicio.,"El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, y es un hotel moderno, en un edificio antiguo que fue remozado. 
Las habitaciones son algo pequeñas , por lo que nos alojamos en una Jr. Suit . 
Muy buena cafeteria , y rastaurant con 1 estrella Michelin. Servicio de Concierge , Room Service. 
Servicio de Spa previa cita con precios de Mercado . Servivio de Peluqueria , tambien previa cita , pero con precios exorbitantes , imposible utilizarlos. En una peluqueria cerca un shampoo y peinado cuesta alrededor de 28 euros y en los servicios del hotel lo tienen a 100 euros. !! 

Una  desventaja del hotel es que insiten en tener las camas con las pequeñas medidas europeas , habiendo espacio en las habitaciones para poner una cama king size medida americana ,  o  2  individuales tambien en medidas americanas de 1.00 mts - 1.10 mts. ; en ves de la europeas que son muy chicas e incomodas. !! 
O la pequeña cama que llaman de matrimonio y mide cerca de 1:40 mts . 

Otro punto importante, el area del baño esta integrada a la habitacion , la regadera y lavabo estan  a la vista , por lo que puede ser incomodo , dependiendo con quien se comparta la habitacion. El inodoro si esta en un cuartito que ofrece privacidad.",5,2015,10,20
23,Empfehlenswert und sehr zentral gelegen,"Wir wollten noch ein Stück Sommer in Spanien genießen und die Wahl fiel auf Barcelona. 
Das Ohla Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen und ideal die Stadt zu Fuß zu erkunden. Viele kleine Restaurants findet der Besucher in unmittelbarer Nähe und natürlich die gesamte Altstadt. 
Der Service im Hotel ist sehr gut, bequeme Betten, schöne Zimmer, wenn auch ein wenig laut, was durch die zentralen Lage bedingt ist. 
Gewöhnungsbedürftig ist das offene Badezimmer, das sollte der Gast einfach wissen. 
Einen kleinen Kritikpunkt muss ich dennoch anbringen, die Zimmer waren wirklich erst ab 15:00 Uhr zu beziehen und oftmals erst nachmittags und nach Aufforderung gereinigt. 
Besonders empfehlenswert ist die Dachterrasse mit einem zauberhaften Pool und natürlich die hervorragende Küche im Restaurant mit dem perfekten Service.",4,2015,10,07
23,Urlaub,"Das Hotel liegt sehr Central und man kann im Umkreis von 3-4 km einiges sich zu Fuß erarbeiten. Wer lieber mit dem Bus Fährt die Haltestelle ist direkt vor dem Hotel. Das Hotelpersonal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer waren sehr sauber aber man hört die Hauptstraße und die U-Bahn auch im vierten OG was gewöhnungsbedürftig ist. Auf dem Flur im vierten OG roch es mehrere Tage sehr schlecht, was aber am letzten Tag weg war. Zum Frühstück möchte ich nur sagen das es sehr gut ist aber es gibt keine Laktose freien Milchprodukte was sehr schade ist. Die zum Hotel gehörende Tapas-Bar ist sehr zu empfehlen und wirklich gut,trotzdem sollte man darauf achten das die Speisen nacheinanderkommen weil das Personal sehr schnell mit dem servieren ist und dann ist das Essen lau warm.(vielleicht ist das aber richtig und ich sehe das falsch) 
 ",4,2015,10,06
23,Tolle Lage,"Die Lage des Hotel Ohla ist toll. Man erreicht alles bequem zu Fuss. Die Dachterrasse ist ebenfalls sehr schön, dort war auch der Service im Gegensatz zu Empfang und Bar stets äusserst freundlich und zuvorkommend. Nicht das der Service oder das Personal unfreundlich waren, aber desinteressiert und etwas langsam. Die Zimmer sind geschmackvoll und schön eingerichtet. Leider kann man die Fenster nicht öffnen. Alles in allem waren wir zufrieden aber für fünf Sterne erwartet man doch etwas mehr Gastfreundschaft und Service. Frühstück haben wir jeweils ausser Haus eingenommen.",3,2015,10,01
23,"Gute Lage, aber sehr laut","Das Zimmer war ordentlich eingerichtet und ausgestattet. Leider hört (und spürt!) man die Metro, welche bis tief in die Nacht verkehrt. Das hat sich auch nicht viel gebessert nachdem wir vom ersten in den sechsten Stock umgezogen sind. Mir ist klar, das es in der Innenstadt immer etwas lauter ist. Aber das rechfertigt keine vibrierenden Nachttische.
Auch das Frühstücksbuffet war für ein 5-Sterne-Hotel eher dürftig. Dia Auswahl an Brot und Aufschnitt war übersichtlich (jeweils 2-3 Sorten) und der Kaffee war sehr bitter, da er schon länger auf der Warmhalteplatte stand. Das Personal hinter dem Tresen wirkte ebenfalls nicht sehr souverän - z. B. mussten wir häufiger auf ""Nachschub"" warten.
Diese fundamentalen Mängel können leider nicht die schöne Dachterasse, den gut ausgestatteten Fitnessraum sowie die zentrale Lage hinwegtrösten.",2,2015,09,29
23,Schönes Hotel im Zentrum von Barcelona,"Sehr gute Lage, Tiefgarage im Hotel. Guter Service, Schönes Zimmer. Ausgezeichnete Küche im Sterne-Restaurant. Das Frühstücksbuffet entsprach leider nicht dem Preis. Pech hatten wir mit dem Auto in der Tiefgarage. Die Mitarbeiter hatten alles verstellt und die Kofferraumklappe ging nicht mehr auf.",5,2015,09,10
23,Nach wie vor ein tolles Hotel für die Erkundung der Stadt und zum Shopping,"Das Hotel Ohla gehört unserer Auffassung nach zu den besten Hotels in Barcelona. Wir waren nun zum zweiten Mal Gast in diesem Hause. Wir wollten eigentlich ein neues Hotel ausprobieren, letztendlich gab es jedoch immer Punkte, die uns dann wieder zu diesem Hotel führten:
- Unserer Auffassung nach, mit die schönste Dachterasse in Barcelona
- Die Zimmer sind sehr schön (Deluxe Design Room) in ausreichender Größe
- Die ""Paseo di Gracia"" und die Ramblas sind Fußläufig erreichbar. Ebenso das ""Barri Gotic"" um abends noch ein paar leckere Tapas zu genießen.
- Der Service ist toll.
- Die Sauberkeit ist hervorragend
- Der Schlafkomfort ist, obwohl das Hotel an einer Hauptstraße und direkt an der Metro liegt, hervorragend. Die Zimmer sind extrem gut Schallisoliert.

Kleiner Tipp: Wenn man einen anstrengen Tag in Barcelona hinter sich hat und einem die Füße weh tun, ist hinter dem Hotel ein kleines ""Knabberfisch""-Spa, bei dem man sehr gute Fußmassagen erhalten kann.",5,2015,09,07
23,Hotel di gran classe con ottima gastronomia.,"Nella centralissima via Laietana un 5 stelle d'impostazione classica riattualizzato, esternamente ed internamente, con grandi interventi di design. Da segnalare anche per la piscina sul tetto (con annesso lounge bar) ma sopratutto per l'ottima gastronomia; il ristorante Sauc si caratterizza per la tipica cucina catalana reinterpretata da uno chef di grido; La Plassohla offre un assortimento ricco e fantasioso di tapas di gran livello.",5,2015,08,29
23,Si può fare di piu,"Posizionato al centro di barcellona tutto molto scenografico ,tutto apparentemente bello ma poco funzionale la concierge al piano terra reception inesistente ,la camera angusta e con una pavimentazione del bagno mal concepita in modo particolare la doccia che allaga l'area lavandino 
Tutto apparentemente elegante ma abbastanza mal progettato
Servizio mediocre con prezzi nn dimensionato alla qualità 
La colazione assolutamente insoddisfacente per la reception e l'accoglienza del maitre di sala che si occupa solo di verificare se sei nella lista degli aventi diritto nn ti accompagna nn ti dà indicazioni sul buffet e la cucina espressa che anche qui é solo scena !!
Ho ordinato le uova con bacon pietose ed invisibili nel piatto!! 
La qualità è altra cosa!!
Il livello è altra cosa !!",3,2015,08,09
23,Super terraza!!!,"Esta terraza es un gran descubrimiento. Es un poco pequeña y  los fines de semana esta demasiado llena para mi, pero es una maravilla. 

Bonitas vistas de Barcelona, muy buen ambiente y lo mejor de todo ....los cocktails que sirven y el buen trato del personal.",5,2015,08,06
23,Excelente hotel en una inmejorable ubicación,"En general todo estaba muy bien. La habitación era amplia, limpia, la cama muy cómodo, una ducha de diseño fantástica y en el mueble bar había de todo.
La terraza y piscina tienen de las mejores vistas de Barcelona, donde además hacen cócteles y ""mojitos"" excelentes (eso si a 16€).
El trato del personal es de 10.",5,2015,07,28
23,Gute Lage,"Wir waren 3 Nächte im Ohla zu Gast weil es einem 5* Boutique Hotel entsprechen sollte. 

Das Hotel ist sehr modern gestaltet aber dennoch angenehm. Das Personal beim Einchecken war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. 

Unser Zimmer war sauber und zweckdienlich eingerichtet. Aufgrund der Einteilung mit der Glasdusche in der Mitte des Zimmers fallen die Zimmer ziemlich klein aus. Die im Zimmer integrierte Ecke mit dem Waschbecken war leider etwas dunkel. Wir hatten direkten Blick auf die betriebsame Hauptstrasse. Von dieser haben wir jedoch, im Gegensatz zu der U-Bahn, kaum etwas gehört.

Das Frühstücksbuffet fiel eher bescheiden aus. Das Angebot war jeden Morgen identisch. Enttäuscht waren wir vom nicht vorhandenen Service beim Frühstück. Wenn man à la carte bestellen wollte, musste man als Gast auf das Personal zugehen.

Der Blick über die Stadt von der Dachterrasse aus, ist sehr schön. Das Platzangebot ist leider sehr beschränkt. Der kleine Pool ist für eine kurze Abkühlung ausreichend.

Zum Geburtstag gab es zu unserem Erstaunen keinerlei Aufmerksamkeit Seitens des Hotels. 

Das Auschecken haben wir im Gegensatz zum Check-in als Abfertigung empfunden.

Für uns entspricht das Hotel keinem Boutique Hotel und wird unserer Meinung den 5* nicht gerecht. Daher stimmt das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis leider nicht.",3,2015,07,25
23,Aktuell unser Favorit in Barcelona!,"Lage
Absolute Top-Lage, wir waren ausschließlich zu Fuß unterwegs: Passeig de Gracia, Hafen, Sagrada Familia, Strand, El Born, Ramblas - alles gut zu erreichen. Direkt an der Via Laietana ist natürlich viel Verkehr, aber laut und voll ist es eigentlich überall in Barcelona. Vom Flughafen haben wir einTaxi genommen, kostete ca. 30€, man kann auch den Aérobus nehmen, die Haltestelle ist zu Fuß gute 5 Minuten entfernt. 

Zimmer
Wir hatten ein Standard-Zimmer (3 Nächte à 280€), was für einen Stadt-Wochenende von der Größe her absolut ausreichend war. Es lag zum Innenhof (Zimmer 301) und war daher herrlich ruhig. Das Bett war bequem und der abendliche Lavendelduft hat zu einem äußerst tiefen Schlaf beigetragen. Lediglich die Dusche bekommt einen kleinen Punktabzug, es roch ein wenig muffig, der Wasserdruck war recht schwach und die Temperatur ließ sich auch nicht gut zu regulieren; das Wasser war entweder heiß oder kalt. Das Wifi war in der Zimmerrrate inkludiert, allerdings recht langsam und auch nicht immer stabil. 

Frühstück
Das Frühstück war in unserer Zimmerrate inkludiert und wurde in Buffetform angeboten. Typisch spanisch, frisches Obst, süße Teilchen und Kuchen, Joghurt, Toast und Marmelade, Baguette, Käse und Schinken, Cerealien, Saft, Cava. Eierspeisen konnte man à la carte bestellen. Eigentlich alles da, was man so braucht. Alles in Ordnung, im Vergleich mit anderen 5-Sterne-Hotels in Barcelona (Grand Hotel Central, Claris), auf dem gleichen Niveau. Aber es gibt noch Luft nach oben, insbesondere was den Service betrifft, der war nämlich nicht vorhanden. Wir wurden in drei Tagen nicht einmal gefragt, ob wir etwas aus der Karte bestellen möchten...

Service
Generell ist das Ohla jedoch sehr auf guten Service bedacht. Das fängt bereits bei der Buchung an und setzt sich fort beim Check In und auch bei den Concierges. Wir haben uns hier sehr gut aufgehoben gefühlt. Vielen Dank auch für die Glückwünsche zu meinem Geburtstag und die Flasche Cava, sehr aufmerksam! 

Fazit
Von der Lage her hat uns das Ohla noch besser gefallen als das Claris oder das Grand Hotel Central. Das Hotel ist außerdem modern und stylisch und wir werden sehr gern wieder herkommen!",4,2015,07,19
23,"Sehr gute Lage, klare Empfehlung, sehr modern (wirkt möglicherweise kühl)",Wir waren im Anschluss an eine Kreuzfahrt für 3 Nächte im Hotel Ohla. Die Lage ist für eine Erkundung der Stadt wirklich absolut perfekt. Besser geht es nicht. Die freundlichen Mitarbeiter sind stets hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer ziemlich modern und minimalistisch gestaltet. Insgesamt absolut fein aber etwas zu kühl für unseren Geschmack gestaltet. Keine separate Tür zum Bad und offene Dusche mit Glaswand Richtung Bett. Toilette natürlich separat. Größe ausreichend. Fenster lassen sich nicht öffnen. Klimaanlage sehr gut. Super Dachterrasse mit tollem Blick über die Stadt. Dort ist auch der Infinitypool. Absolutes Highlight ist das La Plassohla (Restaurant wo es auch das Frühstück gibt). Unbedingt dort Abendessen und die vielfältigen Tapas probieren.,4,2015,07,08
23,Toplage in Barcelona,"Sehr gutes Hotel mit schönen Details. Zimmer sind sehr frisch und modern eingerichtet. Kleiner Gag ist die Tür zur Toilette. Der Holzboden im Zimmer ist sehr angenehm, besser als der übliche Teppich. Top ist die Dachterasse mit einem hervorragendem Blick über die Stadt.",5,2015,06,20
23,Wohnlich-modernes Design in zentralster Lage,"Hier zu übernachten ist jedesmal wieder ein absolut tolles Erlebnis. Die Zimmer sind sehr modern gestaltet und TROTZDEM gemütlich. Die Gastro-Bar im Erdgeschoss verwöhnt einem mit bester spanischer Küche - allein dafür zahlt es sich aus, hier zu wohnen. Wir kommen sicher wieder!",5,2015,06,02
23,Design Hotel in Super-Lage,"Das Hotel ist nur ein paar Gehminuten von Plaza Catalunia entfernt, wo der Aerobus vom bzw. zum Flughafen hält.

Ungewöhnlich ist die Rezeption im ersten Stock. Man wird dort hinbegleitet und freundlich mit einem Glas Wasser oder Cava empfangen. Die Zimmer sind sehr modern eingerichtet. Das Bad ist allerdings sehr dunkel gehalten, auch von den Lichtverhältnissen. Zum Schminken ist das eher ungünstig. Im Vorfeld kann man Wünsche zum Pillowmenu oder Bettwäsche äußern. Das Zimmer ist mit einem angenehmen Raumduft versehen. Man sollte das mögen, da sich die Fenster nicht öffnen lassen. Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber, da die Reinigung mehrmals täglich erfolgt.

Das Hotel verfügt über einen kleinen Fitnessraum und eine kleine Sauna ( 2. Personen max). Insgesamt ist der Wellnessbereich eher spartan und ungemütlich als entspannend. So werden nur 2 Liegen angeboten mit direkten Blick auf die Behandlungsräume im Spa.

Die Dachterasse hat eine sehr schöne Aussicht. Leider ist der Pool ungeheizt und nicht besonders groß.

Das Frühstücksbüffet ist klein aber fein. Es gibt eine kleine Auswahl an Käse, Aufschnitt und Brot. Dafür ist die Qualität durchgängig gut. Schade ist, dass man von der Frühstückskarte nur ein Gericht bestellen kann (Hierzu zählt auch das Frühstücksei). Jedes weitere Gericht kostet 4€.

Wirklich gut ist die Cocktailbar im Eingangsbereich. Hier hatte ich den vielleicht besten Long Island Ice Tea meines Lebens.

Insgesamt ist das Hotel aufgrund seiner Lage, seines freundlichen, hilfsbereiten Services und der schicken Zimmer absolut empfehlenswert.",4,2015,05,31
23,Excelente ubicación y restaurantes,"Estuvimos alojados con mi marido por 5 noches. Tiene una ubicación excelente ya que hay muchísimas cosas que se pueden hacer caminando: la Catedral, Mercado de la Boquería, la Rambla, Palau de Música, Casa Batllo, 4 Gats, Kokua, el puerto, Museo Picasso, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo, etc. Sauc es un restaurant exclusivo con un menú muy atractivo, cenamos allí y estuvo muy bien, tranquilo, bien atendidos. El restaurant de abajo tiene más mesas y comida mas común pero muy rica. La habitación bien y el servicio del personal muy amable y colaborador. Una decepción fue que la tan publicada terraza estuviera cerrada, a pesar de ser fin de semana largo y un clima espléndido, caluroso y soleado. Me parecieron un poco caras las tarifas en relación al tamaño de la habitación y que el desayuno no estaba incluido.",4,2015,05,23
23,Bello ma dipende dai gusti,"L'hotel è situato nel barrio gotico, fulcro della vita e dello shopping di Barcellona.
L'Hotel è stato concepito per essere ristorante di classe aperto a tutti e hotel di design. Design molto essenziale, fatto di bianco e nero, che si percepisce appena entrati.
A noi a dato una sensazione fredda e spoglia.
Le camere sono pulite, ottimamente equipaggiate e silenziose . L'unico aspetto che non ci è piaciuto é il bagno (nero), aperto sulla stanza con la doccia a vista, privo di bidet e con il wc separato in un piccolo locale.
Colazione ottima per qualità e scelta.
Personale gentile ma freddo e non parla assolutamente l'italiano.",4,2015,04,26
23,Ein ordentliches Hotel in einer sehr angenehmer Lage,"Wenn man den Maßstab eines 5 Sterne Hauses anlegt wird dieses Haus den Sternen nicht ganz gerecht.Dazu fehlen ganz einfach viele Dinge innerhalb des Hauses und deshalb stimmt auch das Preis.-Leistungsverhältnis nicht ganz,da kann auch die schöne Aussicht auf der Dachterrasse unseren Gesamteindruck nicht trüben.Die Lage ist sehr gut und man erreicht alles in wenigen Gehminuten.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit,das Frühstück ist recht ordentlich aber eben nicht 5 Sterne Kategorie.",3,2015,04,03
23,Excelente!!!,"Excelenteeeeeeeeeeee

23,Elegantes Hotel mitten in der Altstadt von barcelona.,"Hotel ist vom Flughafen aus in 15 Minuten mit dem Taxi zu erreichen.
Rezeption ein wenig gewöhnungsbedürftig im 1. Stock gelegen.
Empfang mit einem Glas Champagner sehr herzlich. Man wird von den Mitarbeitern aufs Zimmer geführt dort wird einem die Elektronik ausführlich erläutert.
Hatten eine Junior Ecksuite im 5.Stock .Zimmer war sehr ruhig dafür das man sich mitten im Zentrum befindet. Einzig schade war das man die Fenster nicht öffnen kann.
Raucher müssen deshalb jeweils vor die Eingangstüre stehen oder auf die Dachterrasse im 8. Stock gehen.Dachterrasse lohnt sich aber wegen der wunderbaren Aussicht über die Stadt.
 Bad ist direkt im Zimmer und wunderbar eingerichtet.Das Gourmetrestaurant und die bar sind auf alle Fälle einen Besuch wert.",5,2015,03,10
23,Zentral in ruhiger Lage mit Pool,"wir waehlten dieses Hotel wegen der zentralen Lage, grossen Fenstern, ( deluxe junior suite) sehr modernen  Einrichtung der Zimmer und des Michelin Restaurants.

23,Fantastico,"Hotel ubicado en el centro de Barcelona,con todos los servicios cerca.
Habitación muy espaciosa,con bañera y ducha,la cama muy grande y cómodisima y el desayuno servido en la misma habitación fantástico.
Todo super correcto,para repetir.

23,Luxus im Zentrum,"Mitten im Zentrum, unweit der Altstadt liegt dieses Luxushotel direkt an der Via Laietana. Die Zimmer sind top, bieten viel Platz und sind sehr modern eingerichtet mit einem offenen Bad, das dem Raum nochmals mehr Grösse verleiht. Die grossen Fenster sorgen zudem für viel Licht im Raum, doch während der Nacht hört man dadurch auch die Strasse und den Verkehr.
Das hauseigene Restaurant Saüc ist exquisit, vielleicht die Gänge manchmal gar etwas zu speziell. Der Gele aus Oliven und Zucker zum Apéro oder auch die kleinen süssen Plätterteigröllchen mit der salzigen Füllig nicht unbedingt jedermanns Sache. Und das Wild zum Hauptgang war sah zwar super aus, war dann aber doch recht faserig und auch etwas zu stark gebraten, schade.",4,2015,02,01
23,"gut gelegenes, stylisches Hotel","Das Hotel ist super gelegen. Tolles Design und das Personal ist auch sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Tolle Aussicht vom Pool auf dem Dach. Das Frühstück ist auch echt super. Eierspeisen werden frisch auf Bestellung gemacht. Und es gibt vom Müsli, Früchten, Kuchen bis zum Cava echt alles. Ich würde in Barcelona wieder dieses Hotel buchen.",5,2014,12,29
23,Spitzen Hotel,"Super Lage im Stadtzentrum. Die Zimmer sind guter Standrad und entsprechend ausgestattet. Pool und Bar auf dem Dach sind sehr speziell und sollten unbedingt mit einem Besuch gewürdigt werden. 
Frühstück wir in Buffetform angeboten und lässt keine Wünsche offen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich. Das Essen im Restaurant haben wir nicht versucht, soll aber toll sein. Vom Hotel erreicht man in wenigen Minuten das Stadtzentrum, die Metro und die Rambas. Das Hotel ist für einen Citytripp der ideale Ausgangspunkt.",5,2014,12,29
23,"Cocktails en el bar ok, en la terraza, mejor vino.","Terraza simple pero con unas vistas preciosas sobre los tejados del Gótico.
Buena ubicación y servicio.
Cocktails en el bar ok, en la terraza, mejor vino.
Restaurant bueno,, pero no pedir comida en la terraza.
La terraza es preciosa, pero pedir un simple vino es lo mejor.",4,2014,11,02
23,Mal was Anderes,"Cooles Design. 

Am Besten ist aber der Pool auf dem Dach. Nicht dass man darin wirklich toll schwimmen kann. Aber es ist einfach spektakulär. Genauso wie die Aussicht. Allein deswegen ist das Hotel schon toll. Schnell mal nach dem Bummel ausruhen und dann trotzdem nicht das Gefühl haben man verpasst was. Weil man ist ja mittendrin.

Allerdings durch den Trubel auch nicht ganz ruhig. Die U-Bahn hört man im 1. OG schon recht gut. Aber wie gesagt: Man geht raus und ist direkt in der Altstadt.

Gewöhnungsbedürftig ist die offene Dusche aus Glas. Ein Vorhang zum Zimmer hin wäre vielleicht ganz sinnvoll gewesen.",5,2014,10,25
23,Ohla...che hotel,"Ci siamo concessi 3 gg romantici a Barcellona...e non potevamo scegliere hotel migliore per questa occasione. Tutto, è stato stupendamente perfetto... fin da subito, quando appena arrivati ci siamo sorseggiati un aperitivo...sulla terrazza all'ottavo piano: un mohijto così ti rigenera anche dopo giornate estenuanti di lavoro...ed è subito fiesta!!! Il profumo inebriante che ti accompagna per tutto l'hotel...è un vero senso di piacere, a conferma della cura dei dettagli. E poi la nostra stanza...una junior suite...è stata sicuramente la parte che più di tutte abbiamo apprezzato...minimal ma esclusiva,elegante, raffinata, di lusso e sempre con questo profumo... ci ha regalato sensazioni piacevolissime. Anche la qualità del sonno è garantita !! Grazie allo staff per la gentilezza, la cortesia e i preziosi consigli che ci ha dato sui vari locali di tapas e chiringuitos : che meraviglia, che squisitezza ! 
Noi in questo hotel e in questa splendida città  ci abbiamo lasciato un pezzetto di cuore...buon motivo per ritornare a prendercelo ! Sicuramente torneremo...

23,Bester Barkeeper! Alles TOP!,"Hatte die besten Coktails in diesem Hotel. Zimmer und  Lage ist super. Auch der Ausblick von der Dachterrasse ist genial. Besonders hervorzuheben ist das Frühstück, was normal im Mittelmeerraum nicht auffällig ist, hier einfach ein Traum und sehr ausgefallen.",5,2014,09,27
23,Design und Service vom feinsten,"Das ganze Haus besticht durch seinen eigenen Designstil - von den schönen Zimmern über die verschiedenen Bars und dem Restaurant bis zur beeindruckenden Dachterrasse mit Pool. Das Frühstück ist fantastisch. Das Personal ist äusserst freundlich, dies möchte ich besonders hervorheben. Das Preisleistungsverhältniss stimmt, der hier gebotene Service ist von A-Z einwandfrei. Die Lage ist optimal, 3 Minuten zu Fuss von den Ramblas und dem Catalunya-Platz. Zu erwähnen ist lediglich, dass die Zimmer nur für Paare geeignet sind - die Dusche befindet sich offen im Raum, und auch das Bad ist nicht abgetrennt mit einer Wand. Ich fand das toll - da ich mit meinem Freund da war. Viel Vergnügen im Ohla! :)",5,2014,08,31
23,Un mix di raffinatezza e accoglienza,"L'Hotel Ohla di Barcellona  è un luogo incantevole, raffinato, delizioso. Ho riscontrato grande attenzione al design e alla cura dei dettagli, all'igiene e al culto del bello. Gentilezza  e professionalità alle stelle sono le caratteristiche del personale. Nel bar  annesso all'albergo si possono fare degli spuntini squisiti come le papas bravas o le bruschette sfiziosissime o mangiare del prosciutto appena tagliato. Mi ha colpito il calore e la magia di un posto moderno, elegante, ricercato, ma nello stesso tempo intimo, capace di fondere al lusso, l'atmosfera della propria casa. Tutto in questo posto mi ha  trasmesso gioia e bellezza. Internet è gratis ed è velocissimo. Eccellente rapporto qualità prezzo. Si possono fare anche trattamenti estetici, massaggi e bagni  caldi con petali di rosa ed essenze inebrianti preparati nella vasca della propria stanza. Stupendo!!!! La piscina scoperta, piccolina, ma di forte impatto, è sul tetto, con una vista che toglie il respiro, fra le cattedrali e le cupole. Un sogno!!! Poi c'è anche un bar all'aperto accanto alla piscina dove gustare cocktail e aperitivi. Ci tornerei subito!!!!Tutto favoloso!!!I",5,2014,08,02
23,Bellissimo e molto chic,"Hotel bellissimo posizione perfetta! All'ottavo piano c'e una piscina piccola ma molto bella dove abbiamo fatto un aperitivo il cui costo nn è stato eccessivo considerando che da li si ha la visulale completa di tutta la città e della cattedrale. L'unica pecca:vino versato su calici di plastica! Lo staff è molto giovane e gentile! Si sono sforzati di parlare in italiano,cosa non fatta in nessun altro posto visto a barcellona! Lo consiglio! 😀✌️",5,2014,07,22
23,Top-Hotel mitten in Barcelona,"Das Hotel liegt zentral mitten in der Stadt. Von hier ist es nur ein kleines Stück zu Fuss zu den Stadtvierteln Barri Gotic, La Ribera und Ciutat Vella. In letzteres sollte man gehen um gute Tapas zu Essen. Die Ramblas und Einkaufsstrassen sind alle innerhalb weniger Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen. 
Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind gut zu Fuss, per taxi, Bus oder U-Bahn von hier zu erreichen. Die U-Bahn-Station liegt direkt vor der Tür. Trotz der zentralen Lage ist es im Hotel und auf den Zimmern sehr ruhig. Das Hotel verfügt über einen Pool auf dem Dach, tagsüber kann man sich hier gut sonnen und ab und an abkühlen. Abends wird der Bereich zu einer Lounge-Area umgewandelt in der man sehr gute, wenn auch recht teure Cocktails bekommt. Der Blick auf Barcelona ist aber toll. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und modern eingerichtet. Der Badbereich ist schön und kann sich sehen lassen. Der Service im Hotel stimmt in jedem einzelnen Bereich. Englisch ist Standard beim Personal, Deutsch wird vereinzelt gesprochen. Vorteil ist einer der Concierges, welcher Deutsch spricht und einem viele gute und wertvolle Tipps geben kann. Rundum ein tolles Hotel!!!",5,2014,07,15
23,Ideal para unos días de relax,"Un hotel céntrico, con atención exquisita, mejor comida y piscina chillout con vista maravillosas de Barcelona. Y en el bar de la terraza de la piscina preparan unos cócteles espectaculares.
Los conserjes son especialmente atentos y te aconsejan e indican muy por encima de su cometido, ayudándote a que la estancia sea aún más grata.",4,2014,07,07
23,Sehr schönes Hotel in sehr schöner Stadt,"Habe dieses Hotel auf Empfehlung eines Reisebüros gewählt. Mir hat es sehr gut gefallen, wie schon in den letzten Bewertungen steht. Geniale Lage, wunderschöne Junior Suit in ausgefallenem aber praktischem und modernem Design. Sehr freundlich betreut worden bei Fragen zu Restaurant, Stadt und vieles mehr. Ich werde sicher wieder nach Barcelona reisen und das nächste mal muss ich kein Hotel suchen sondern buche wieder im Ohla. Und ja - auf der Dachterasse fühlt man sich wie im Himmel - rundum.",5,2014,07,04
23,Angenehmer Aufenhalt,"Nach meinen Recherchen auf Tripadvisor und Kombination mit Amex-Meilenpaket, muss ich sagen, dass der  Aufenhalt sein Geld bzw. seine Meilen wert war. Die Lage ist Spitze, nur 2 min zu Fuss durch eine kleine Fussgängerzone zum Corte Ingles, 5 min zu Fuss zur Rambla, direkt gegenüber ein schönes Starbucks Cafe..
Das Tapas Restaurant war qualitätsmässig sehr gut, jedoch wollte mich der Kellner (Frau allein) erst mal in die Bar zurücklotsen, da könne man auch trinken und Tapas essen (wo gibt's denn so was??) Zum Glück waren noch andere Mitarbeiter in dem Restaurant, die sehr freundlich und hilfreich waren, so dass ich am Ende doch ein sehr leckeres und ausgefallenes Abendessen geniessen konnte. 
Der Pool ist wirklich sehr klein, sieht auf den Fotos groesser aus. Die Mitarbeiter rotieren auf allen Ebenen im Hotel und mit den Cocktails geben sie sich grosse Mühe und je nach Bedienung, werden auch Sonderwünsche erfüllt. Schöne Aussicht auf der Dachterrasse. 
Trotz Hauptverkehrsstrasse war das Zimmer ruhig und konnte gut verdunkelt werden. Ich habe sehr gut geschlafen, was für mich nicht selbstverständlich ist. 
Alles in allem ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt.",4,2014,06,29
23,Einzigartiges 5* Hotel im Herzen von Barcelona,"Das Ohla Hotel ist zweifelsohne eines der besten 5* Stadthotels die ich kenne. Ideale Lage (4 Gehminuten von der La Rambla entfernt), tolle Architektur und ein einzigartiger Pool mit Bar am Dach des Hotels. Personal war stets bemüht und freundlich, wenn Barcelona dann sicher wieder ins Ohla Hotel.",5,2014,06,22
23,Super Lage,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, an bester Lage, um die Stadt zu besichtigen. Die Zimmer sind sauber und mit dem nötigen Komfort eingerichtet. Sehr speziell ist der gläserne Swimmingpool auf dem Dach, wo man eine Top-Aussicht geniessen darf.",4,2014,06,13
23,Super Hotel  - in super Lage,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral in der Nähe vieler Sehenswürdigkeiten und einer Menge Shopping-Möglichkeiten. Wir hatten das Hotel für 2 Nchte nach einer Kreuzfahrt gebucht und kamen früh morgens um ca. 10:00 Uhr dort an. Der sehr nette, deutschsprechende Concierge kam direkt raus, als er uns ankommen sah und nahm uns unser Gepäck ab. Unser Zimmer war noch nicht fertig und uns wurde angeboten die Koffer dort zu verstuen und es wurde uns angeboten die Wellness und Gym-EInrichtungen des Hotels sowie die wunderschöne Dachterasse mit Pool zu nutzen. Wir haben uns allerdings entschieden eine Stadrundfahrt mit den Hop-on/Hop-off-Bussen zu machen. Hierzu bekamen wir vom Concierge sehr gute Informationen und ein paar wirklich hilfreiche Tipps. Um ca. 14:00 Uhr fragten wir nach, ob unser Zimmer fertig ist und wir hatten Glück. Wir bekamen ein schönes Deluxe-Zimmer im 4. Stock. An der Rezeption wurden wir erstmal gefragt, ob wir ein paar sind, warum haben wir dann im Zimmer gesehen. Ein Concierge brachte uns zu unserem Zimmer und zeigte uns, wo was ist (Minibar, Safe etc.) und brachte uns kurz darauf unsere Koffer. Wir fühlten uns vom ersten Moment an sehr willkommen. Als wir am Abend zurück kamen waren waren die Betten aufgeschlagen, die Vorhänge zugezogen, es langen kleine Bonbons auf den Kopfkissen und ein kleiner Brief mit einer Karte mit der Wettervorhersage für den nächsten Tag! Was uns freute und auch ein wenig verwunderte war, das man von der Hauptstraße die direkt vor dem Hotel verlläuft nichts hörte. Das Frühstück war gut, aber nicht überragend was die Auswahl angeht, es gab etwas Käse und Aufschnitt, Obst Joghurt und eine kleine Karte mit waremn gerichten, wie z.B. Rührei oder Pancakes, welche allerdings sehr, sehr klein waren. Das Personal beim Frühstück war leider auch nicht gerade sehr freundlich. Am Abreisetag konnten wir unsere Koffer bis zum Nachmittag im Hotel lassen und wieder alle Annehmlichkeiten des Hauses nutzen. Wenn das Hotel nicht ausgebucht gewesen wäre, hätten w ir auch unser Zimmer noch länger behalten können. Im Großen und Ganzen waren wir sehr zufrieden mit dem Ohla Hotel und würden es immer weiter empfehlen.",4,2014,06,05
23,"Viel Design, wenig dahinter...","Zunächst wird man etwas durch die ""Lobby"" geschockt - schwarz in schwarz gehalten - vor allem ein ""Erlebnis"" wenn man gerade aus der grellen Sonne in das Hotel reinkommt - man sieht definitv nichts ! Unten im Erdgeschoss bedfindet sich dann nur der Consierge hinter einem kleinen Pult. Zu einchecken muss man dann umständlicherweise in die erste Etage. Dort nimmt man dann relativ privat an einem Schreibtisch Platz - habe mich an irgdendein Amt erinnert...  Das Personal war sehr rerserviert - eine coolness, die aber für den den Wohlfühlcharakter tödlich sind !! Die Personen beim einchecken haben sich mindestens so wichtig gefühlt wie manche Gäste selber...absolute Hochnäsigkeit - hier total fehl am Platz ! Wohne größtenteils in top (!) Hotels und kann dies einschätzen. Keine Frage, ob die Anreise angenehm war, keine Frage nach Preferencen, keine Frage ob man eine Begleitung zu den Zimmern wünscht...etc.  Nicht das dies alles zwingend notwendig ist, allerdings sollte ein 5 (!) Sterne Hotel doch mit anderem Maßstab beurteilt werden als ein 4 Sterne für den halben Preis ! Nun, das Zimmer dann: winzig ! Ein kleiner Drehhocker als Sitzmöglichkeit - und das für zwei Personen. Keine Ablage für den Koffer oder die Einkäufe. Die Dusche mitten im Raum (von allen Seiten Glas, was dann bei Benutzung die ganze Zeit schmutzig und schlierig ist! ....bis das Housekeeping kommt). Design hin oder her - absolut ungemütlich und wiederum das schwarz tonangebend - kalter schwarzer Boden, kalte schwarze Wände, und schwarze Schränke. Die Toilette ist ein Loch - schlimmer als jede Gefängniszelle. Nirgends Fenster zum öffnen. Das Bett ist allerdings gut ! 
Wir haben mit Frühstück gebucht - ein großer Fehler: 40 iInuten hat es gedauert, bis mal ein Kellner unseren 1qm Tisch abgeräumt hatte um Platz zu schaffen. Kaffee ist von minderer Qualität und wärmt wie in billigen US Motels auf einer Heizplatte. Der Espresso (einzige Kaffeespezialität) ist von Kaffeepads unterirdischer Qualität. Die Dame hat mich sowas von entnervt angeschaut, als ich nach dem wie und warum der Padmaschine gefragt hatte - kein Wunder: die Beschriftung der Macheine war schon ganz aufgelöst. Null Vielfalt bei den Speisen - nur eine Sorte Rohschinken und eine Sorte Salami...und das im Land des Jamon ! Wirklich enttäuschend...  Gehen SIe besser in eines der umliegenden Bars - dort gibt es leckere Speisen in Hülle und Fülle und das zu einem wesentlich günstigeren Preis ! 

Das Highlight des Hotels ist die Dachterasse - schöner Blick zum Dom und kleines Becken zum plantschen. Nur leider sind nahezu immer (!) alle Stühle und Liegen besetzt. Sieht dann aus wie auf dem Strand von El Arenal, wenn da all die Gäste auf dem Boden liegen...aber trotzdem - hier für die 2 Sterne....

Zum guten Schluss ist das Hotel nicht zu empfehlen - viel Design und Schein zu einem überteuerten Preis. Da gibt es wesentlich besseres in Barca - und in Europa sowieso ! Und an den Personalchef: Ihre Mitarbeiter sollten sich nicht zu wichtig nehmen - eine natürliche Freundlichekeit und Servicebereitschaft kommt immer weiter !",2,2014,06,02
23,Perfektes Stadthotel,"Das Hotel ist an der Via Laietana perfekt gelegen, die Zimmer (Junior Suite) großzügig, modern und absolut sauber. Der Knaller ist die Dachterrasse: ein Glaspool, sehr chillige Sitzecken, ein Traumhafter Blick auf die Stadt. Das Personal an Rezeption und Frühstück ist unglaublich freundlich, mehrsprachig und gibt sehr tolle Tips für den individuellen Stadtausflug. Wellness und Fitness (Sauna und Studio) sind recht klein, aber top modern ausgestattet (dafür sollte man eh nicht in das Hotel gehen). Die Gastronomie ist exzellent. Ein ideales Refugium für den Stadttrip zu zweit; für Familien mit kleinen Kindern eher nicht geeignet, da es keine Betreuung oder Spielecken gibt. (Fanden wir aber super, da wir unsere Kinder für das Wochenende daheim gelassen haben :-) ). Es ist ein Spitzenstadthotel, das seinen recht hohen Preis jeden Euro wert ist. Wir kommen wieder.",5,2014,05,23

23,Cooles Hotel an top Lage,"Das trendige Hotel steht mitten im Zentrum von Barcelona an Bester Lage. Die moderne Einrichtung hatte uns sehr gut gefallen. Schade, dass man die Fenster in den Zimmern nicht öffnen kann. Die Luft wäre dann etwas frischer in den Zimmer. Die Terrasse mit dem Pool ist auch ganz toll. Die Bar könnte etwas besser sein. Uns hat es im Ohla sehr gut gefallen und wir können es nur weiter empfehlen.",4,2014,05,14
23,Perfecto!,"Excelente servicio y atención al cliente con unas buenas instalaciones.
Faltan espacios comunes, el restaurante esta bastante bien con un bien desayuno y un menú más que correcto. Si viajas en pareja es una buena elección y puedes tomarte una copa en la cockteleria!",5,2014,05,11
23,Muy buenos cocktails,"Expertos bartenders detrás de la barra y una oferta de alta mixología! Es caro pero vale la pena y si querés probar tragos realmente trabajados, pensados y con productos premium, es un must en Barcelona. Te recomiendo el Bloomsbury Fizz, cóctel con Tanqueray Ten y Oporto. El cóctel 5 Drop Ritual también es muy bueno y diferente, con whisky japonés, St. Germain y Angostura. Y si te animás a sabores diferentes el Oaxaca Bijou con Mezcal, Chartreuse Amarillo y vermut seco. Muy buenos todos!",4,2014,05,08
23,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel an bester Lage,"Die Junior Suite im Ohla Hotel ist ein echtes Erlebnis: ein geräumiges Zimmer mit riesigem Doppelbett und einer frei im Raum stehenden Badewanne. Die Toilette verschwindet im Wandschrank, alles sehr stylisch und top modern eingerichtet. Die Sicht auf die herrlichen Gebäude des gotischen Viertels ist einzigartig.
Das Personal an der Rezeption ist extrem freundlich und hilfsbereit. Sie machen alles möglich. Reservierungen von Museen bzw. der Gaudi Attraktionen sowie von Restaurants lässt man am besten an der Rezeption erledigen. Das klappt perfekt und man spart sehr viel Zeit.
Die Dachterrasse mit Glaspool ist die Krönung: perfekt für eine Siesta mit Poolbar und Ausblick!

23,Hotel boutique: pro e contro,"Ottima posizione per raggiungere i punti di maggior interesse anche a piedi. Tipico albergo di design, elegante ma un po' freddo. Stanze eleganti, ma non impeccabili nella pulizia (una federe macchiata e lisa non è da albergo 5*). La colazione, adeguata al livello dell'albergo, ha tutto l'essenziale, ma nulla più. Il personale è cortese, ma dà l'impressione di essere ancora in formazione e non del tutto pronto per un albergo di questa categoria. Complessivamente una esperienza positiva, ma non memorabile. Migliorabile.",4,2014,04,30
23,Top Hotel,"Super Lage, die optimale Ausgangslage um Barcelona zu erkunden. Nur 200 m von der gotischen Kathedrale entfert, ca. 500 m zum Placa de Catalunya und Las Ramblas - also wirklich perfekt. Frühstück könnte vielleicht etwas variabler und größer sein, aber ansonsten gibt es nichts zu mäkeln. Saubere schöne Zimmer, nettes zuvorkommendes Personal, gute Betten - alles in allem - ausgezeichnet.",5,2014,04,30
23,Stylisches Hotel an Top Lage!,"Schönes, stylisches Hotel an Top Lage. In 2 Min erreicht man zu Fuss las Ramblas, Altstadt, Paseo de Gracia etc. Gutes Frühsück, gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Ruhiges Zimmer allenfalls bei Reservation wünschen, falls wichtig. Wir würden wieder dieses Hotel wählen.",4,2014,04,15
23,albergo design,"L'albergo è molto bello ed in una posizione magnifica. Il personale è molto gentile anche se il concierge ci aveva consigliato un ristorante dove non siamo andati perchè proprio non ci piaceva, sembrava una tavola calda e neppure delle più belle. Nella stanza c'erano dei gradini e di notte dovevamo stare molto attenti perchè erano neri e un pò pericolosi.  E' tutto troppo scuro e sinceramente le scale nere non mi sono piaciute nè in stanza nè fuori. I letti sono eccezionali. La terrazza è spettacolare. La colazione buonissima e ripeto, il personale è gentilissimo.",4,2014,04,15
23,Optimales 5* Hotel für eine Städtereise,"Aufgrund der vielen guten Bewertungen auf tripadvisor und der optimalen Lage entschieden wir uns für das Hotel Ohla. Vom Flughafen nimmt man am besten den ""Aerobús"" (eine einfache Fahrt kostet 5.90 €) bis zur ""Plaça de Catalunya"". Von dort aus sind es nur noch 5min zu Fuss bis zum Hotel. Ausserdem lassen sich die ""La Rambla"" und das ""Barri Gòtic"" bequem zu Fuss erkunden.
Der Empfang im Hotel war sehr freundlich. Das Check-in erfolgte prompt. Danach wurden wir auf unser Zimmer begleitet. Wir buchten ein Zimmer der Kategorie ""Design Deluxe"". Beim Betreten fällt einem gleich das moderne, minimalistische Design auf. Der Flur und das Bad sind eher dunkel gestaltet. Das Schlafzimmer bildet mit seinen hellen Farbtönen den perfekten Kontrast dazu. Unser Zimmer war ca. 30 m2 gross. Neben dem Schlafzimmer befindet sich gleich das offene Bad und eine separate Toilette. Wer beim Duschen ungestört sein möchte, wird sich in diesen Zimmern nicht besonders wohl fühlen, da man vom Bett aus freien Blick auf die Dusche hat. Jeden Abend gibt es einen sogenannten ""Turndown-Service"" bei dem die Betten für die Nacht hergerichtet werden und das Zimmer nochmals kurz auf Vordermann gebracht wird. Als wir nach unserem ersten Abend zurück kamen, wurden wir mit einer Flasche Cava und Blumen überrascht, was uns sehr beeindruckte. 
Zwei Stockwerke über uns befand sich der ""Rooftop-Pool"". Leider ist dieser nicht beheizt, so dass man ihn in der kälteren Jahreszeit nicht nutzen kann. Einige Liegen und Lounges laden dazu ein, die wundervolle Aussicht über Barcelona zu geniessen. Ausserdem verfügt das Hotel über einen Fitnessraum und eine Sauna. Im ganzen Hotel gibt es freies W-LAN. Die Ohla-Boutique-Bar und die Ohla-Gastrobar, wo auch das Frühstück serviert wird, befinden sich im Erdgeschoss. Das Frühstücksbuffet lässt praktisch keine Wünsche offen. Von frischen Säften, Käse, Fleisch, Brötchen, Lachs, bis zu selbst gemachten Pancakes ist für jeden etwas dabei. Das Gourmetrestaurant ""Saüc"" haben wir nicht getestet.
Was ich an dieser Stelle speziell hervorheben möchte, ist der sehr gute Concierge-Service. Ein sehr netter, etwas älterer Herr (leider weiss ich seinen Namen nicht mehr) hat uns die richtigen Restaurants empfohlen und unsere Ausflüge organisiert.
Die optimale Lage, das moderne Design und der gute Service machten unseren Barcelona-Aufenthalt perfekt. Da auch das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis stimmt, werden wir bestimmt ins Hotel Ohla zurückkehren. Ich kann das Hotel gerne weiter empfehlen und wünsche eine gute Reise!",5,2014,04,03
23,Excelente Hotel en una Excelente ubicacion!,"Fuimos con mi mujer y mi hija, el trato fue muy bueno y las intalaciones del hotel acordes a lo que esperabamos.
Sin dudas volveriamos. El Desayuno es Excelente asi tambien los menus del mediodia. La ubicacion es perfecta, estas a pocas cuadras del Born y a pocas de plaza cataluña.",4,2014,03,17
23,Prestigioso a dimensione umana,"Soggiorno dal 29 gennaio al 2 febbraio, con mio marito e con una coppia di amici. Direi palazzo signorile, camere molto curate e accoglienti, con spazi non grandi ma agevoli. Personale gentile, ragazzi italiani che hanno dato il massimo per farci vivere al meglio questi 5 giorni a Barcellona, avendo capito quel che noi volevamo oltre ai ristoranti che avevamo già programmato dall'Italia con notevole anticipo. Sono proprio riusciti a farci innamorare di Barcellona. Il bar dell'hotel ci ha fatto gustare i più buoni cocktail mai bevuti, il barman e' tra i primi al mondo e oltre alla bellezza della presentazione, l'equilibrio dei sapori era veramente eccezionale. Questo hotel e' veramente da consigliare e noi sicuramente al prossimo giro ritorneremo perché raramente viaggiando si trova una sinergia così grande. Anche i locali consigliati ci son piaciuti moltissimo. Abbiamo capito come mai molti giovani e non ...decidono di andare a lavorare, a studiare o a fare l'anno sabatico in questa città. Prezzo interessante per i servizi dati.",4,2014,03,04
23,Ideal,"Sehr zentral, super Service. Auch das Restaurant ist sehr gut.Kommen gerne wieder hierher. Wir sind nur zufällig hier her gekommen, aber es war ein Glücksfall. Alle Restaurants und Sehenswürdigkeiten sind in direkter Umgebung. Pool konnten wir im Februar nicht nutzen, sah aber gut aus.",5,2014,02,22
23,La classe non è acqua,"Bellissimo e vero 5 stelle posizionato in location ideale , nel centro storico ma fuori dal trambusto della ramblas  distante solo 200 mt.

Molti parlano in italiano. Consigliatissimo",5,2014,02,18
23,Buen hotel,"Un buen servicio, buenas instalaciones y un inmejorable desayuno.

En el centro de la ciudad, un servicio impecable y no olvides tomarte una copa en la cockteria...",5,2014,01,20
23,No esta a la altura de un 5 estrellas,"Acabamos de regresar de una noche en el hotel Ohla.
El hotel y el servicio no esta a la altura de un 5 estrellas.
Al llegar al hotel nadie te recoge o te lleva las maletas. Tu debes cargar con ellas tanto al entrar como al salir.
Llegamos el 18.01 a las 19h y nos fuimos el 19.01 a las 12h. Todo este tiempo el carro del servicio de limpieza estuvo en el pasillo al lado de la puerta de la habitación, lo que molestaba al entrar y salir.
En la habitación (estábamos en la 202) se oía el metro y se notaba la vibración.
La presion del agua no era suficiente. Si uno se duchaba el otro no podía tirar de la cadena o abrir el agua para lavarse los dientes, ya que entonces la ducha se quedaba sin agua.
No había agua caliente en la habitación. Al intentar llamar a recepción tampoco funcionaba el teléfono. Llamamos desde el movil y después de esperar 10 minutos tuve que ponerme el albornoz y bajar a recepción a quejarme. Finalmente vino un técnico a arreglarlo.
Al llegar al restaurante (teníamos un pack con cena) te ofrecen un aperitivo de bienvenida, que luego te lo cobran. Avise en el restaurante que no era tolerante a los lácticos, no me trajeron el queso del menú, no me lo cambiaron por nada y de postre me trajeron arroz con leche.
En resumen, una experiencia decepcionante, y desde luego no se corresponde el precio con la calidad, ni de un hotel de 5 estrellas ni de un restaurante de 1 estrella Michelin.",2,2014,01,19
23,Perfetto o quasi,"Hotel di design, molto curato e dal servizio impeccabile. 
Stanza deluxe, abbastanza grande e con il bagno ""a vista"" (la doccia è in mezzo alla stanza, per capirci), come pare imponga una nuova moda...
Personale gentilissimo (molti sono italiani) e competente, due ristornati di livello (uno stellato michelin) e un cocktail bar dalla qualità eccelsa (pare che sia famoso in città).
La nostra stanza era bella e silenziosissima, direi il letto più comodo che ricordi (uniche pecche: poteva essere un po' più grande e non si può aprire la finestra per accedere al balcone).
E' assai meritorio che, a differenza di quanto avviene in italia, non ci abbiano fatto pagare alcunchè per nostro figlio di 16 mesi, pur avendoci fornito il lettino e dei prodotti da bagno appositamente per lui.
Colazione di qualità davvero ottima, non manca quasi nulla ed è servita in maniera elegante, senza inutili affastellamenti di cibo.
Posizione perfetta per visitare la città.
Promosso a pieni voti e senza dubbi.
Prezzo: 1415 euro per 5 notti con colazione a cavallo di capodanno. Li vale.",5,2014,01,10
23,Esperienza positiva,"Molto comodo per posizione è un boutique hotel ben riuscito e ben concepito. Affascinante la facciata esterna e molto design all'interno.
Bar ottimo (personale italiano) così come tutto lo staff (molti italiani) cordiale ed efficiente. Piscina all'ultimo piano affascinante (peccato che siamo a gennaio!!!)",4,2014,01,04
23,Ideal für Städtereisen,"Wir übernachteten für fünf Nächte im Ohla Hotel. Der Empfang mit einem Glas Sekt war überaus freundlich und warmherzig. Das Hotel entsprach durch moderne, Freundlichkeit des Personals sowie Sauberkeit unsere Erwartungen für ein 5* Hotel. Für Informationen jeweiliger Art wie Metro/Bus, Tapas-Empfehlung, oder sonstige nicht touristische Sehenswürdigkeiten wird man sehr freundlich, sowie kompetent beraten.
Wir hatten bewusst ein Design-Zimmer (6 Stock) aufgrund Lärmemission gebucht. Die Aussicht war toll, Betten sehr bequem, Sauberkeit Top. Zimmerservice gut mit jeweiligen Wetterangaben für den darauffolgenden Tag und ein kleines Present a Schockolade.
Das Frühstücksbüffet ist unserer Meinung nach knapp 4* würdig. Die Backwaren waren hart oder gummig, die Auswahl an Möglichkeiten begrenzt. Eine Portion nach Wahl zubereitetes warmes Frühstück (Ei/Speck/Pfannkucken) ist inbegriffen.
Zu empfehlen ist die Dachterasse mit einem Tollen Blick auf einen Teil von Barcelona.
Die Lage ist Ideal, in wenigen Gehminuten befindet man sich an der rambla/Bus-/Metrostation.
Somit war dieses Hotel für uns optimal für unseren Städtereisetrip.",4,2013,12,30
23,Perfekter Kurzurlaub!,"Für einen Kurzurlaub in Barcelona das perfekte Hotel. Zentral gelegen, wunderbare Restaurants und klasse Service! Dachterrasse mit Pool. Die nächste U-Bahn Station schräg gegenüber, in ein paar Minuten zu Fuss im Gotischen Viertel und Abfaht Hop on Hop off Bus.",5,2013,12,14
23,Toller Kurzurlaub im Ohla Hotel,"Wir haben ein tolles Wochenende im Ohla Hotel in Barcelona verbracht.

LAGE
Das Hotel ist zu Fuß ca. 5 min vom Placa de Catalunya entfernt, an dem auch die Flughafenbusse halten (5/10 min Takt). Direkt vor dem Hotel ist eine U-Bahn Station. Die Altstadt mit Kathedrale ist in wenigen Minuten genauso wie die La Rambla zu erreichen. 

SERVICE
Der Service hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Zur Begrüßung gibt es ein Glas Cava oder etwas anderes an der Rezeption. Wir waren leider etwas zu früh da und das Zimmer war noch nicht fertig. Uns wurde aber sofort angeboten das Gepäck dort zu lassen. 
Abends gibt es einen Turn-Down Service mit Schokolade und dem Wetter für den nächsten Tag.

ZIMMER
Wir hatten eine Junior Suite. Diese war stilvoll eingerichtet und hatte ein großartiges sehr bequemes Bett. Auch die Pflegeprodukte die zur Verfügung stehen sind ausgezeichnet. Etwas schade ist, das man das Fenster nicht öffnen konnte - wir hatten aber die Lüfung in Betrieb (sehr leise)

HOTEL
Großartige Dachterasse mit Blick auf die Kathedrale. Auch das Meer kann man sehen. Im Sommer sicher noch besser als im November. Tolle Atmosphäre am Abend. 
Die Fassade des Hotels ist ein Hingucker. Auch toll ist das man nur mit einer Zimmerkarte im Aufzug nach oben fahren kann.

FRÜHSTÜCK
Tolle Auswahl an frisch gepressten Säften. Auswahl an Marmeladen und herzhaften Speisen sehr gut. Genau so wie die Auswahl an Joghurt. Einzig die Auswahl an Brot und Obst könnte größer sein. Omlette und andere Gerichte gehören zum Frühstück dazu, stehen aber nicht auf dem Buffet (wird für jeden individuell zubereitet.

RESTAURANT
Erstklassiges Essen im Saüc-Restaurant. Wir hatten ein tolles Menü mit tollem Service.",5,2013,12,09
23,Perfekte Lage! Sauber & Ruhig!,"Das Hotel an sich liegt perfekt mitten in Barcelona! Zu Fuss ist man in 5-10 Minuten direkt an der Rambla, aber auch in der Altstadt oder dem schöneren Stadtteil Born. Direkt gegenüber des Hotel ist die U-Bahn Station L4, was zum Sightseeing sehr hilfreich war.
Empfangen wurden wir an der Rezeption mit einem Glas Sekt was wirklich super angenehm war.
Das Zimmer in der 6. Etage hat uns sehr gut gefallen und war auch ruhig. einziges Manko war, dass man die Fenster nicht öffnen konnte. U-Bahn hört man nachts dennoch ein wenig, trotz 6. Etage!

Die Sauna ist winzig und findet Platz für 2 Personen! Da wir immer die einzigen Gäste dort waren, war dies ebenfalls ausreichend. Manko hier: Sauna, Friseur, Massage und Fitnessbereich ist ein großer Raum mit schmalen Glastüren getrennt. Die Musik lud nicht zum entspannen ein. Während des Saunaganges kam dann ein Gast für den Friseur welcher sich im gleichen Raum befindet!!! Also nichts zum entspannen, sondern nur zum aufwärmen gut.

Das Frühstück war gut, Aber nicht den Bildern der Homepage entsprechend. Brötchen jeden Tag alt/vertrocknet und für ein 5* Hotel nicht Standard! Die Auswahl der sonstigen Speisen war gut, aber definitiv max. 4* Niveau! Service jedoch sehr gut.

Die Hotelbar soll 2012 als beste Bar Barcelonas ausgezeichnet worden sein. Nach einem Cocktail dort, konnten wir dies jedoch nicht bestätigen. Die Drinks mögen ausgefallen sein, jedoch nichts besonderes. Kleine Karte..

An einem Abend wollten wir uns nach dem Sightseeing ein wenig ausruhen. Die Putzfrau klopfte dann um 18:30 an die Tür!!! Nachdem wir ihr zu verstehen gaben, dass das Zimmer nicht gereinigt werden muss, rief dennoch die Rezeption 15 min später an!!! Keine gute Abstimmung und wir fühlten uns gestört und belästigt.

Das Zimmer wird generell wohl mehrmals am Tag geputzt oder gecheckt! Selbst wenn man für nur 20 min in die Sauna verschwand war das Zimmer danach wieder aufgeräumt. Fpür uns etwas befremdlich aber okay..",4,2013,12,06
23,perfekte Lage/tolles Ambiente,"Hotelpersonal/Hotel: zuvorkommendenes, freundliches und  hilfsbereites Personal. Zimmer waren modern eingerichtet, im voraus aufgegebende Wünsche bezgl. Kopfkissen, Bettwäsche und Raumduft wurden erfüllt. Jeden Abend eine kleine Aufmerksamkeit und Informationen vorhanden.Leider konnte aufgrund der Jahrszeit die tolle Dachterrasse nicht genutzt werden, 
Lage: zentral, so dass viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß erreichbar sind. Um das Hotel herum sehr schöne kleine verwinkelte Gasse, Geschäft, Tapasbars

Wir würden wieder kommen.... :-)",4,2013,12,02
23,Un vero 5 stelle!,"Ottimo hotel vicino al centro di Barcellona, ma in una via molto tranquilla. Hotel di design, moderno e dotato di tutti i confort. Camere spaziose, molto pulite e con tutto il necessario. Piccolo neo, mancava il ferro da stiro che era da richiedere alla reception...
Ottimi prodotti da bagno. 
Menzione speciale per la colazione....veramente super!!! Ottima scelta di succhi di frutta, piatti salati (mi manca già il prosciutto....) e ottimi dolci!!!!
Spettacolare la piscina all'ultimo piano con vista sulla città!!!
Personale cortese e disponibile. Non parlano italiano...
Da consigliare!!!",5,2013,11,07
23,Ausgesprochen freundlicher Service,"Die Lage ist perfekt, um die Stadt zu erkunden. Die Altstadt, die Ramblas, zahlreiche Museen sind zu Fuß erreichbar, der Stopp für die Sightseeingbusse um die Ecke. Die Zimmer sind modern und sauber, die Betten ausgesprochen bequem. Sehr ruhig, angenehme Klimaanlage und die Fenster sind komplett verdunkelbar. Das Frühstück war sehr lecker und der Service ist ausgesprochen freundlich. Auch unsere Kinder haben sich sehr wohlgefühlt. Die Dachterrasse ist hübsch, jedoch sehr klein. Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen.",5,2013,11,05
23,Wunderbar - ohla!!!,"Wir - mein Sohn und ich - haben - leider nur für eine Nacht - ein design room im Ohla-Hotel in Barcelona gebucht; wurden ohne Anfrage upgraded in die Junior-Suite, die uns so gut gefallen hat, dass wir abends den room service des Hotels nutzten, um das schöne Zimmer mit herrlichem Blick länger zu genießen. Auch das Bad mit sehr schöner Badewanne hat uns zum Relaxen animiert und wir haben uns den ganzen Tag darauf gefreut! Vor allem aus architektonischer Sichtweise - ich bin Architektin - ist dieses Hotel, angefangen von der Rezeption bis zu den Zimmern, dem Wellnessbereich und der Bar und den Restaurants ein Augen- und - nicht zu vergessen! - Gaumenschmaus! Leider konnten wir den Roof-Pool aufgrund des herbstlichen Wetters nicht nutzen; werden aber dafür extra im Sommer noch einmal gerne in das schöne gut gelegene Hotel wieder kommen! Die Aussicht von dort konnten wir trotzdem genießen! Vielen Dank! Christine und Hendrik Hölzenbein",5,2013,11,04
23,Eccellente!,"Ottimo albergo di lusso, siamo stati in un junior suite che è veramente accogliente e spaziosa, personale gentile e disponibile senza affettazione, colazione varia ed abbondante, ristoranti di livello, soprattutto il sauc insignito di una stella michelin è da provare assolutamente. Ci torneremo!",5,2013,10,09
23,4 gute Gründe um im OHLA Hotel zu übernachten!,"1. Die Lage: sehr zentral, man erreicht viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß, U Bahn Zugang  vor dem Hotel
2. Das Design: Zimmer (besonders die jun. Suite zahlt sich aus) Pool am Dach, die Aussicht, das Feeling: fantastisch
3. Das Essen: Sehr gute Qualität, besonders die Gastro (Tapas) Bar und  die Boutique Bar mit tollen Drinks
4. Das freundliche Personal

Zur Lage:
Anfahrtszeit vom Flughafen Bcn max. 30 Minuten, Kosten für eine Taxifahrt ca. € 30,00 und für einen Privattransfer vom Hotel ca. € 80,00 pro Wagen.  Direkt neben dem Hotel beginnt die Fußgängerzone, Am Hafen ist man zu Fuß in ca. 15 Minuten, die Ramblas erreicht man in ca. 5 Minuten, das Altstadtviertel liegt vor der Haustüre.  U-Bahn Station Urquinaona gleich  gegenüber vom Hotel. Auf dieser Seite des Hotels führt eine stark befahrene Straße vorbei. Der Vorteil der zentralen Lage ist auch ein kleiner Nachteil: Straßen- und U-Bahnlärm ist vorhanden, stört nicht wirklich, man hört aber auch im Zimmer immer etwas von der Straße und der U-Bahn. 
Empfehlung: mit dem Taxi kommt schnell und günstig zu den weiteren Sehenswürdigkeiten wie  Z.B. Sagrada Familia (ca. 10 Minuten und € 7,00); Parc Guel oder Montjuic (unbedingt Fahrt mit der alten Seilbahn zum Hafen machen).

Das Hotel: Sehr gefälliges Design, man trifft immer wieder auf die Farbe schwarz vor allem im den öffentlichen Bereichen. Dafür ist die Beleuchtung  zu dunkel/düster. Hier sollte man eine etwas stärkere Beleuchtung einsetzen.

Dachterrasse: sicher das Highlight, toller Blick  über Barcelona. Glaspool, ca. 16 Liegen (war ausreichend), Bar und Loungearea. Am Abend werden die Liegen weggeräumt und alles wird zur Loungearea.

Ein kleiner Wellnessbereich ist vorhanden (Fitness, Sauna).

Zimmer: hier überwiegt die Farbe weiß, der Badbereich ist in schwarz gehalten. Die Junior Suite ist wirklich ausgesprochen schön und großzügig gestaltet. Der Mehrpreis zu den kleinen Standardzimmern zahlt sich meiner Meinung auf jeden Fall aus, wenn man dafür auch mehr ausgeben möchte.

Essen: die Gastro Bar bietet hervorragende Tapas und Weine, unbedingt probieren. Restaurant Saüc: wir schauten uns nur die Räumlichkeiten an, die waren für unseren Geschmack nicht unbedingt einladend im Vergleich zum restl. Hotel (sehr nieder - erdrückend), haben deshalb dort keine Essen probiert. 

Die Boutique Bar ist wiederum sehr einladend gestaltet und bietet hervorragende Drinks an.

Was man sonst noch wissen sollte:

Viele kleine Bars, Restaurants in der in unmittelbarer Umgebung vorhanden. Unbedingt einmal zu Mittag auf der Rambla bei  der Metrostation Liceu in die Markthalle Mercat de la Boqueria gehen und dort z.B. im Restaurant oder Bar ""Universal"" den frischen Fisch und die Meeresfrüchte vom Markt essen - ein Erlebnis. Auch erwähnenswert die ""neue Markthalle"" Mercat de Sta. Caterina mit dem einzigen Restaurant Cuines Santa Catarina. Überraschend anders, auch die Speisekarte.

Fazit: 
Wer nicht in den großen Hotels absteigen möchte, trotzdem alle Annehmlichkeiten wie Bar, gutes Essen, tolles  Design haben will ist hier genau richtig. Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen.",5,2013,10,04
23,Best hotel ever,"Mai stati in un hotel più bello. Camera super [--] con doccia ""panoramica"", ma il meglio del meglio è la piscina in vetro sul tetto. Chiedete del barman toscano, vi farà un cocktail piccante che è una delizia sopraffina. Tutto molto free, bello, di classe. Andateci, ne vale la pena.",5,2013,09,05
23,Consigliatissimo!,"Bellissimo hotel, posizione perfetta ad un passo da metropolitana, camere pulite, arredamento di design, colazione abbondante e buonissima, piscina all'ottavo piano con vista da sogno.Ci ritornerei! Unica pecca, pochi saluti, pochi sorrisi da parte dei dipendenti!",5,2013,09,03
23,Hotel meraviglioso,"Hotel di design molto bello. la posizione è perfetta e si trova vicinissimo a molti punti di interesse come la cattedrale di Barcellona, la rambla, le vie dello shopping e la casa della musica. La metropolitana è a 20 metri di distanza. 
Le camere sono molto belle e confortevoli. La piscina sul terrazzo anche se piccola è bellissima ed offre un panorama stupendo.
Il gastro bar ha dei piatti molto stuzzicanti (consiglio le ostriche con spuma di lime e mela verde).
Il ristorante Sauc (con una stella michelin) non vi deluderà.
Lo staff è molto gentile e premuroso.
Che dire di più !!!",5,2013,09,03
23,un'ottima scelta,"Ho scelto questo hotel per festeggiare una data importante e non mi ha deluso in niente: ottima accoglienza, tutto è curato nei dettagli e una terrazza con piscina che ci ha lasciati senza fiato, regalandoci delle fantastiche ore di relax tra una passeggiata e l'altra.
Abbiamo inoltre provato il gastronomic bar per un pranzo a base di tapas eccezionali, di altissimo livello: combinazioni particolari in porzioni giuste perfettamente consigliate dal personale di sala, gentile e cordiale.
Non ci siamo lasciati scappare una cena al Sauc, ristorante presente nell'albergo premiato con una stella michelin: tutto perfetto, davvero.
Insomma il mio voto è decisamente positivo, ci ritornerò sicuramente.",5,2013,09,02
23,Semplicemente perfetto,"Hotel di lusso, con personale gentilissimo, all'arrivo ci hanno offerto il loro champagne.
Posizione ottimale per visitare la splendida Barcellona.
Stanze con arredamento minimalista, curate e pulite. Buon rapporto qualità-prezzo.
Da ritornarci. 
Lo consiglio.",5,2013,08,18
23,NO ESTÁ A LA ALTURA DE UN 5 ESTRELLAS,"es un hotel normal, en el que tienes que entrar exigiendo para que no te den una de sus peores habitaciones, me pareció excesivamente cara la habitación para lo que es, si que es verdad que tienen un diseño muy bonito y son de un tamaño normal, pero si pueden te meten en la primera planta, que no es que sea excesivamente ruidosa, pero se escucha el metro cada 5 minutos y tiembla la habitación, además de que la primera planta está demasiado baja y si no tienes las cortinas te ven desde la calle.
en cuanto al desayuno, no lo hemos probado,  porque nos pareció excesivamente caro, 25 € por persona.
en la habitación tienes un montón de amenities, aunque alguna como la crema hidratante ya estaba medidada y no la cambiaron y también el minibar es muy extenso, tienes de todo, pero eso sí a precios de hotel.
en la azotea tienen una piscina que está muy bien con bar que por la noche está muy bién porque tiene unas vistas impresionantes de toda barcelona, pero como siempre excesivamente caro y poca calidad, el vino te lo dan en copa de plástico, aunque me imagino que es por seguridad, pero ya no es lo mismo.
en general el hotel está bien, pero  para lo que cuesta, no es como para tirar cohetes, eso si el personal es super amable.",3,2013,08,16
23,Ein perfektes Stadthotel an sensationeller Lage,"Zentrale Lage, moderne ruhige klimatisierte Zimmer mit WIFI, das Frühstücksbuffet ist ausgezeichnet. Wir wurden rundum verwöhnt. Die Concierges waren sehr hilfsbereit. Der Pool auf dem Dach und die Lounge mit Blick über die ganze Stadt runden den perfekten Aufenthalt ab. Wir werden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen.",5,2013,08,07
23,Ein gelungenes Wochenende im Ohla Hotel,"Das ohla-hotel liegt sehr zentral am Randes des Barri Gotic, nur ein paar Meter zur Placa Catalunya und zur Rambla. 
Busse und Metro fahren ebenfallst in der Nachbarschaft ab. 
Unser Zimmer (Standart) war modern gestaltet, gut ausgestattet (tolle Klimaanlage) und ausreichend groß. 
Die Dachterrasse mit Swimmingpool , Bar und einem Superblick über Barcelona dazu drei Chill-Out-Lounges - Herrlich. Einziger Vermutstropfen - Caipi oder Mojito ...16,-€...;-((
Eine Flasche Cava oder Rose hingegen nur 25,-€...geht doch!
Das ganze wäre nicht perfekt, wenn nicht das Personal sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und kompetent wäre - sie sind es...! Ein rundum gelungenes Wochenende im Hotel ohla in Barcelona.....Wir kommen wieder zurück - ins Hotel Ohla",5,2013,07,30
23,"Gute Lage, netter Service","Die Lage ist gut zentral, wir hatten ein ruhiges Zimmer zur Seitenstraße hin. Das Frühstück ist leider wie in Spanien meist nur etwas spartanisch.Das Zimmer was sehr schön, groß und gut durchdacht, nur leider ist das Bad sehr dunkel und hat keine gute Lampe, wer also als Frau in offizieller Mission hier ist, könnte sich mit dem perfekten Styling schwer tun.",4,2013,07,29
23,Perfetto in tutto 5* vere !,"Perfetto in tutto, questo hotel offre tutti i servizi ad alto livello !
Perfette le camere,molto ben arredate e pulite .
Arredamento moderno e  minimalista.
Servizi al piano ben eseguiti e celeri.
Fantastico il ristorante delle "" tapas "" dove il buon Filippo , cameriere di origine italiana, marchigiano per esattezza, ci ha proposto un percorso gastronimoco veramente gustoso e ricco di grande originalità.
Il loro cuoco gode di una stella Michelin !
A seguire segnalo il grande bar della terrazza con piscina che offre una vista meravigliosa della città, aperitivi e stuzzichini e... volendo ' relax in acqua se vi piace!
Ricevimento veramente efficiente e alla vera prezza dei 5 stelle.
Cinque giorni bellissimi ed indimenticabili.
Consiglio sicuramente questa struttura, vicina alle grandi vie dei negozi e molto ben servita da Taxi veramente onesti.
Mio voto 9
Merita andateci e buona Barcellona.",5,2013,07,28
23,Céntrico y buen servicio,"Es buen hotel, pero no un gran hotel de 5 estrellas. Es un hotel boutique, cerca de la Catedral y con servicio personalizado. Tratar de evitar las habitaciones de la primera planta que son muy ruidosas, y están divididas en dos niveles con escaleras en medio de la habitación.
El desayuno sencillo, pero rico, en unas instalaciones sin grandes ostentaciones. 
En definitiva, hotel de 5 estrellas normalito, con buen servicio y buena relación calidad-precio.",4,2013,07,05
23,Besonderes Flair,"Wir haben 5 Nächte in diesem Hotel verbracht und werden es, sollten wir wieder einmal Barcelona besuchen ganz sicher wieder buchen. Die Lage ist sehr Zentral aber nicht übermäßig laut. Die Ausstattung ist modern, es ist sauber, das Frühstück ist guter Durchschnitt.das Personal ist sehr freundlich, ein Highlight ist die Dachterrasse mit kleinem Pool, einigen allerdings sehr umkämpften Liegen und atemberaubenden Ausblick auf die Kathedrale. Ausserdem wurde ich gleich nach der Heimkehr per Mail informiert dass im Kasten ein Kleidungsstück gefunden wurde und dieses wurde mir ziemlich unbürokratisch prompt nachgesendet. Aus meiner Sicht ist dieses Hotel absolut empfehlenswert.",5,2013,06,18
23,Excelente!,Genial. Mas que un hotel. Sobretodo los cocktails de la mano de giuseppe santamaria y mikele. Todo un gastrobar. En Barcelona hacia falta. El restaurante sin desperdicio. Comodidad y atención insuperable. ,5,2013,05,27
23,TOP-Lage,"sehr gutes, komfortables Stadthotel an absoluter TOP-Lage, schöne und zweckmässige Junior-Suite, sehr schöne Dachterasse jedoch mit kleinem Pool, Saüc-Gourmet-Restaurant hat ausgezeichnete Küche jedoch Lokal ohne Charme und Ambiente.",5,2013,05,09
23,Gerne wieder,"Das Hotel hat die perfekte Lage um Barcelona zu Fuß zu erkunden. Das Zimmer war modern gestaltet und sehr sauber. Wer im Zentrum wohnen möchte lebt etwas lauter, der Lärm der Straße ist zu hören, aber nicht laut. Der Service war 1A das gesamte Personal war ausgesprochen freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Dachterasse ist der Hit, einfach schön eingerichtet, mit toller Aussicht über Barcelona. Das Frühstück war gut, die Auswahl völlig ausreichend und die frisch zubereiteten Eierspeisen köstlich. Die in der stylischen Bar servierten Cocktails waren perfekt zubereitet und dekoriert. Alles in allem würden wir dieses Hotel bei unserem nächsten Barcelona Urlaub sofort wieder buchen.",5,2013,04,22
23,Uno de los mejores Hoteles de Barcelona,"Mi experiencia en el Ohla Hotel de Barcelona fue muy gratificante, decoración exquisita,  desde el momento en que llegamos y entramos al hotel nos recibio Xavi (consierge) nos dio la bienvenida y nos pidio que pasaramos a registrarnos al piso 0.5 donde nos atendieron sentados comodamente con vino blanco y cava solo esto fue en el momento en el que te registras, muy educados y serviciales todas las personas que trabajan en el hotel, las habitaciones de buen tamaño, lujosas  y muy limpias y tienen un olor muy especial, huelen delicioso. Desayunamos y comimos en el restaurante del hotel donde la comida estaba a muy buen precio y muy rica, otra vez el servicio fue calido y de primera. Los jovenes que trabajan en el concierge son muy educados y muy serviciales, y tambien la chica que es la Hostess de los desayunos, un encanto. Claro que lo recomiendo al 100%. Por cierto, excelente ubicación!!!!",5,2013,04,15
23,Muy bien ubicado,"Muy bien ubidado, cuarto comodo y amplio, con un balconcito, nos lo dieron en una calle lateral no tuvimos nada de ruido. Un desayuno muy variado y se puede pedir a la carta, esta incluido con el precio del cuarto. Muy amables en todo momento, tanto el concierge como el staff del hotel. El hotel tiene en el ultimo piso una piscina  de cristal muy bella y con una vista espectacular. Al entrar al hotel tiene un bar pequeño, vinos buenos, tienen  en el menu una propuesta de degustacion y el servicio bastante rapido y muy atentos. Las areas internas del hotel son un poco oscuras pero no me molesto. Precio calidad bueno.",4,2013,04,13
23,Diseño vanguardista y piscina espectacular,"Muy bien situado en el mismo centro de la via laietana, entre el barrio gotico y el born este hotel te ofrece comodidad, diseño, unas magnificas camas y un restaurante diferente y de gran calidad. El problema es el precio, peero si estas dispuesto a pagar un poco no debes faltar. Lo de la piscina de cristal merece punto y aparte. Chapó por el diseño",4,2013,03,27
23,Gli occhi su Barcellona,"Eh si un hotel veramente eccezionale. Il ""palazzo con gli occhi"" quei mille piccoli occhi che costellano la facciata dell'hotel ti accoglie con incantevole eleganza. Sei veramente nel cuore di Barcellona e allo stesso tempo la puoi osservare in tutto il suo incanto. Stanze minimaliste, ottimamente insonorizzate, arredate con originalità e sapientemente iiluminate. Mentre fai colazione, dalla elegante sala, osservi la Barcelllona che pulsa di vita, di sobria allegria e ti senti in qualche modo partecipe della vita di questa meravigliosa città. Da non perdere il boutique bar incastonato nell'hotel in cui tre geniali ragazzi italiani, in una piacevole atmosfera, preparano incredibili cocktail per me superiori ai più famosi roof hotel di New York. Hotel da Cinquestelle e una cometa si direbbe dalle mie parti.",5,2013,03,18
23,"gut, aber keine 5 sterne","wirklich schönes, wenn auch wirklich teures hotel!
tolle aussicht von der dachterasse.

junior suite was ganz nett, aber nicht weltbewegend! fand nicht das sich der aufpreis (zum standard zimmer) lohnte...

frühstück fand ich wirklich sehr gut, frische eierspeißen.

concierge super!!! beste restaurant empfehlungen...

insgesamt gut, aber nicht sehr gut!
haben mir vom buchen bis 4 tage nach abresie, insgesamt 8 mails geschrieben, empfinde ich persönlich als ein bißchen viel!

23,Aceptable,"Me acerqué a comer al Ohla , no subi´r al Sahüc, pero en el Bar pude degustar una propuesta de menú muy aceptable, relación precio calidad.
Excelente ensalada de cusucús con escabetche , y un suculento padacito de Dorada salvaje, a la brasa , en su punto, una tartita de zanahoria con crema de queso, riquísima, vinos por copas, servicio muy muy atento, bastante ràpido y buen trato.
Para mi gusto, el espacio es excesicvamente frío, oscuro, sin personalidad, a pesar de que se percive un esfuerzo importante de diseño, no consigue crear un atmósfera pareja con el servicio y la oferta.",4,2013,01,23
23,Keine 5 Sterne,"Die Lage des Hotels ist gut. Man erreicht ohne Auto die angrenzenden Sehenswürdigkeiten. Die Zimmer sind angenehm eingerichtet aber laut!!! Vor dem Hotel verläuft eine stark befahrene Straße und unter dem Hotel eine U-Bahn. Der Empfang sowie die Verabschiedung im Hotel waren nicht angemessen für ein 5-Sterne Hotel. (Unbedingt die Rechnung prüfen, bei uns war eine Fehlbuchung über 444,00 €)
Der Service des Concierge war hingegen angenehm.
Wir haben beide Restaurants des Hotels besucht. Das 1-Sterne Restaurant verdient unserer Ansicht nach keinen Stern. Aufgrund des Essens eines Hamburgers in dem anderen Restaurant waren alle Teilnehmer (wir waren zu sechst) am Abflugtag und am folgenden Tag mit einer Lebensmittelvergiftung im Bett bzw. an sonstigen Orten.",3,2012,12,29

23,una grata sorpresa,"Personal muy amable, atentos a todo y siempre dispuestos a ayudar en lo que haga falta.
El hotel està en una ubicación excelente, céntrico y cercano a todo.

Detalle feo: a los cinco días de estar alojados encontramos una nota en la puerta en que debíamos ir a recepción ""para detallar como ibamos a efectuar el pago"", mientras nos bloquearon la puerta de entrada a la habitación... Aparte de este detalle feo, el resto genial.",4,2012,12,01
23,"Schön, laut, modern einfach städtisch!","Lärmige Lage, dank guten Fenstern jedoch kein Problem. Junior Suite sehr modern mit Blick auf 6-spurige Strasse... Fenster können nicht geöffnet werden, was angesichts des Strassenlärms auch kein Bedürfnis ist. Concierge und Receptinist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, jedoch immer sehr hektisch. Verschiedene Einrichtungen glänzen durch tolles Designe jedoch eher unpraktisch. Gutes Frühstück jedoch auch hier viel Hektick und etwas wenig Tische, wenn das Hotel voll ist. Preis-Leistung ist gut aber nur wenn man von Specials profitieren kann. Ja nicht mit dem Mietwagen anreisen, beim Hotel kann kaum zum Gepaekausladen parkiert werden.
Zahlreiche gute Restaurants in nächster Umgebung zu vernueftigeren Preisen als im Hotel. Guter Ausgangspunkt fuer Shopping.

Ristrutturato con criteri moderni, design curato nei dettagli e con linee essenziali, quasi minimaliste, ma molto eleganti.

Ottima cucina, colazione con imbarazzo della scelta.

23,ohla...una stella di troppo,"..è iniziata da Barcellona la nostra zingarata in Spagna senza alcuna protazione. Dopo innumerevoli ""lo siento mucho"" ricevuti da altrettanti innumerevoli addetti alla reception degli innumerevoli hotel del centro di barcellona approdiamo all'Ohla hotel preparati all'ennesimo"" lo siento"". Una gentilissima ragazza , come un'esperta giocatrice di Domino, incomincia spostare caselle e camere e dopo quaranta minuti trova l'incastro giusto e spunta  una fantastica camera  al quinto piano.Pulitissima e curata nei dettagli , peccato per il water che viene giustamente sistemato a parte, ma in una sorta di sgabuzzino per le scope ( sconsigliato mangiare la cazuela de habas o cenare con  cibi a base di legumi onde trasformare il tutto in una camera a gas) ed inoltre, come nella migliore tradizione francese , il bidet non è previsto.Per il resto la camera gode di un'ottima vista ed è ben insonorizzata , materassi ottimi , il personale addetto al piano disponibilissimo. La colazione é compresa ma anonima.
Attenti a non dimenticare nulla in macchina, viene parcheggiata non so dove dal personale addetto (costo 35€ giorno)e solo loro possono accedervi . Il prezzo ? ? 270 € a notte...ma per una zingarata come la ns ci possono anche stare..",4,2012,08,11
23,Oase der Ruhe mitten im Zentrum,"das moderne und sehr zentral gelegene Hotel bietet alles für einen erholsamen Städtetrip. Der auf der Dachterasse, aussenverglaste Pool, die gediegene Lounge laden zum Verweilen ein. Die Zimmer waren tip top sauber und sehr modern. Zwar hört man das Rütteln der unteridisch durchdonnernden U-Bahn, jedoch hat uns dies nicht gestört. Einzig die Plastikglässer für den Weisswein auf der Dachterasse waren dem 5* Haus unwürdig. Da man sich jedoch sehr wohl fühlt würde ich dieses Hotel wieder wählen.",5,2012,08,09
23,porzioni misere e servizio da rivedere,"premesso che ho solo cenato, io e il mio amor siamo entrati in questo ristorante passando per caso in via laietiana  e ci richiamava l'attenzione lo stile del locale minimal ed elegante.

abbiamo ordinato 
1 insalata cesar
1 uovo strapazzato con funghi
1 filetto !!!
1 tartara
2 acqua 
1 pane con tamate

23,"Ottimo ristorante di hotel 5 stelle, ma il prezzo....","Premetto che non ho pernottato nell'hotel, ma solo cenato unitamente a mia moglie in questo elegante gastrobar. Il giudizio complessivo è positivo ma bisogna considerare che il prezzo e la quantità delle porzioni dei cibi sono inversamente proporzionali. Diciamo che le porzioni in reltà sono mezze porzioni. Abbiamo assaggiato delle tapas di livello elevato. Il locale è veramente confortevole, elegante ed in stile moderno. Buono il servizio (per fortuna c'era un cameriere italiano che ci ha aiutato con la prenotazione, altrimenti sarebbe stato un vero problema).  Come apertura abbiamo ordinato dell'ottimo jamon iberico con pane e pomodoro (4pezzettini), un filetto ed un vitellino cotti alla brace, una crema catalana, una mousse al cioccolato, un'acqua piccola, un calice di buon vino al costo di 70 euro. Veramente tantini per quanto abbiamo mangiato, ma forse giusti per la qualità e tipo di locale. Forse ci ritornerei.",4,2012,05,02
23,Opinión solo del RESTAURANTE- el mejor puré de patata que he comido,"Bueno, benísimo todo. La carne excelente, la ensalada cesar muy buena, el risoto no tanto, el pure de patata el mejor que he probado nunca y el postre muy bueno. El Vino de la casa muy digno. Quizás alguien para ser medias raciones lo encuentre caro pero yo realmente disfruté.",4,2012,04,24
23,nuovo Hotel design molto ben piazzato,"Abbiamo scelto l' ohla per festeggiare il nostro anniversario a Barcellona. Posizione ideale per visitare e godere della magnifica città. L' hotel é in stile piuttosto minimal ma ha tutto quanto serve per accogliere e viziare i suoi ospiti. Abbiamo scelto una junior suite al secondo piano. Consiglio di farsi assegnare una camera ai piani alti per una maggiore tranquillità.
Notevolissimo il ristorante annesso all' hotel Saucc cosi' come il bar con ottimi ed originali cockteils. Ci ritorneremo senz' altro.",5,2012,03,02
23,"Toll, freundlich und viel Design","Angenehmes Hotel für Geschäft und privat. Design für Schwarzverliebte aber kann als durchaus interessant angesehent werden. Service: freundlich und kompetent. Die Bezeichnung Juniorsuite ist etwas irreführend, da die Räume nicht sonderlich groß sind, jedoch für Kurzaufenthalt geeignet. Das mit Michelin-Auszeichnung gekürte  Restaurant ist großartig und sollte man sich gönnen! Ebenso ist die kleine Bar hervorragend, die Jungs verstehen den Job. WIFI funzt problemlos.",5,2012,02,12

23,Hotel  di design con una stella di troppo nella valutazione complessiva,"L'hotel e' ubicato  in posizione centrale, baricentrica fra le Ramblas ( una mezza delusione!) e il quartiere Gotico.
Il personale e' disponibile e cortese sforzandosi di metterti a tuo agio. Le stanze sono molto ben insonorizzate e i materassi comodissimi, la pulizia della camere ottima, la differenza la fa il modo in cui l'architetto ha concepito la camera, non esiste il bidet, il lavello e la doccia si trovano in camera in una specie di open space  con qualche difficoltà oggettiva nell'illuminazione necessaria per farsi la barba con il rasoio a lametta....., nella valutazione globale chi ha dato la 5a stella e' stato un poco largo di manica, tutto sommato e' comparato con altri hotel un ottimo 4 stelle.",3,2012,01,02
23,Una muy buena opción en BCN,"Estuvimos en el hotel como parte de nuestra luna de miel recorriendo Europa. Barcelona fue un destino del medio y si bien la ciudad no nos sorprendió (venimos de Londres y París), el hotel nos pareció muy bueno. Sabían de entrada que estábamos de luna de miel y por eso nos actualizaron a una habitación ""design"". Al segundo día nos golpean la puerta de la habitación y un camarero nos alcanzó una frapera con una botella de champagne de cortesía por nuestra luna de miel. El restaurante de abajo nos pareció excelente y el precio más que razonable. Comiendo tapas pagamos promedio de €45 la pareja tomando dos cervezas cada uno. Cuando quisimos comer en los restaurantes de la zona no comimos mejor y pagamos más caro (€55 a €60). Sólo tuvimos dos problemas con la habitación. Una es que el baño está integrado de manera tal que cuando uno se baña se lo ve desde todos lados de la habitación. Y el vapor humidifica todo el ambiente. Como las ventanas están cerradas, la humedad queda presente durante largo rato y el equipo de aire parece no hacer demasiado efecto. El segundo problema fué eléctrico. La anteúltima noche, a eso de las 4 de la mañana cuando dormíamos se nos prendieron todas las luces de la habitación. Se apagaron solas y se prendieron de nuevo. Esto sucedió 5 veces en menos de 30 segundos. El susto que nos pegamos no tiene nombre. Pensamos que alguien había entrado en la habitación pero luego nos comentaron los del hotel que estaban viendo que era porque en otras habitaciones pasaba lo mismo.
Sacando esto, la ubicación y la amabilidad del personal fué excelente en todo momento.",4,2011,12,06

Wohlfühlatmoshäre durch indirektes und dimmbares Licht. Schöne, kleine Bar mit sehr nettem Barkeeper und leckeren Cocktails. Tolles Frühstücksbuffet mit allem was das Herz begehrt und sehr nett serviert (Marmelade und Honig in Mini-Einweckgläsern etc.). Perfekte Lage zu den meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten und viele Restaurants in unmittelbarer Lage, gut zu Fuß zu erreichen.

Wenn man etwas bemängeln möchte, dann höchstens die nicht öffnenbaren Fenster, so dass die Klimaanlage benutzt werden muss.",5,2011,11,06
23,"Design, Austattung und Lage passen","Da es in Barcelona eine größere Anzahl an guten Hotels gibt, haben wir mit unserer Wahl länger als sonst überlegt. Ausschlaggebend war zuletzt die hervorragende Lage. Das Hotel ist ein besonders gelungenes Beispiel für ein perfekt saniertes altes Gebäude. Wir bewohnten eine Juniorsuite. Da vor dem Hotel Strassenbauarbeiten stattfanden, tauschten wir das Hotelzimmer nach einer Nacht aufgrund der Lärmbelästigung gegen eine höhergelegene Juniorsuite. Dieses war mithilfe des aufmerksamen Personals ohne Probleme möglich.
Die Zimmer (JS) sind hell, geräumig, gepflegt und sehr geschmackvoll und designorientiert eingerichtet. Große bodentiefe Fenster (nicht zum Öffnen) bieten schöne Ausblicke auf die umgebenden Häüser. Der Empfang ist freundlich und herzlich, alle Mitarbeiter/innen machen einen guten Eindruck. Schlechte Erfahrungen (2 mal) gab es mit Restaurantempfehlungen des Concierges - Vorsicht, hier besser auf Tripadvisor-Empfehlungen verlassen. Der Spa und Fitnessbereich ist  klein aber ok. Der kleine Pool (auf dem Dach) war eher etwas enttäuschend. Gut regelbare und geräuscharme Klimaanlage in den Zimmern. 
Für eine Städtetour ist das Hotel bestens geeignet und absolut empfehlenswert.",4,2011,10,27
23,"Buen hotel, pobre servicio","Escogimos este hotel para una escapada romántica a Barcelona. Lo vimos con una muy buena oferta, hotel nuevo, buena ubicación y nos dimos el capricho. La estética muy cuidada y minimalista, mucha harmonía en la docoración pero le falta vida, personalidad. 

Supongo que es porque es nuevo y falta pulir detalles. El desayuno es pésimo, escaso y no es de la calidad que merece un 5 estrellas, zumo de naranja aguado... en fin, mucho margen de mejora, algunos hoteles de 3 estrellas sirven mejores desayunos que en el Ohla! 

A nivel gastronómico, el restaurante... no comments, pero parece que no son conscientes de que tienen 5 estrellas.

La conclusión es de un quiero y no puedo. No repetiré y no lo recomiendo.",2,2011,10,17
23,Sehr elegant aber etwas zu dunkel gehalten,"Ein modernes stillvolles Hotel. Für unseren Geschmack etwas zu dunkel. Die Möbel sind schwarz und auch die Vorhänge. Trotzdem sind die Zimmer ausreichend beleuchtet. Die Dusche befindet sich in der Mitte des Zimmers, was wiederum die Zimmer sehr interessant macht. Am Dach befindet sich ein Pool. Dieser ist eher klein und nicht sehr warm. Dafür ist die Aussicht vom Dach des Hotels traumhaft. Alles in allem zufriedenstellend. Die U-Bahn befindet sich gleich vis a vis und auch sonst ist man fast Mitten in der Stadt.",4,2011,10,13

23,Spitzenklasse,"Wir sind zu zweit im Juni 2011 in diesem wunderschönen Hotel gewesen. Das Hotel ist sehr puristisch und ein Muss für Jeden, der Wert auf schönes Design gepaart mit einem exzellentem Service legt. Das Personal war ausnahmslos sehr nett und hatte bei allen Fragen und Wünsche ein offenes Ohr. Die Zimmer sind sehr durchgestyled, dennoch absolut gemütlich, der Aussenpool ein absoluter Hingucker, die Loungeecken gemütlich und der Blich über die Stadt einfach sagenhaft. such die Lage sollte man erwähnen, denn die Via Laietana ist eine paralell Strasse zur Ramblas und dass Gothische Viertel und das angesagte El Born sind in nur wenigen Minuten zu erreichen. Auch die nächste Metrostation ist um die Ecke. Wir hatten eine 
traumhafte Zeit dort und werden sicherlich diese Hotel wieder wählen, wenn wir die tolle Metropole Barcelona besuchen.",5,2011,06,19
23,Hotel di design,"Un albergo in ottima posizione con un ottimo servizio. Il personale è sempre disponibile ed efficente.  Purtroppo l'eccesso di sperimentazione dell'architetto ha fatto sì che le stanze sia pur belle e di tendenza siano estremamente poco pratiche, a danno del confort. Passi per la doccia in camera (sembra sia l'ultima moda!). ma sarebbe stato gradevole almeno avere un vetro satinato e non completamente trasparente... Passi per il lavandino vicino al letto, ma se gli occupanti della camera hanno orari differenti, risulta impossibile svegliarsi in momenti diversi: provate voi a dormire con qualcuno che si fa la doccia o la barba accanto al letto! Fortunatamente il personale ti fa subito vedere dove è nascosto il WC: parete segreta che si apre a spinta... Ultimo ma non meno importante: perchè non c'è un bidet? In un 5 stelle sarebbe stata una gradita presenza.
Credo inoltre che non sia stato molto curato il sistema d'illuminazione, che risulta molto suggestivo e d'impatto, ma assolutamente carente per le necessità pratiche tipo farsi la barba evitando tagli e taglietti....
I letti sono comodissimi e le stanze sono ben insonorizzate.
La piscina sul tetto è piccola ma bella e il panorama sui tetti di Barcellona spettacolare.
Nel complesso è un bell'albergo e si trova in ottima posizione per visitare la città.",4,2011,05,16

En el hotel está ubicado el Restaurante Saüc con una estrella Michelin, donde cenamos excelentemente. Resumiendo, el placer del lujo. Un hotel para recomendar.",5,2011,03,22
23,Questo hotel non è un 5 stelle!!!!!,"Ciao a tutti!
Durante il mio soggiorno a Barcellona ho scelto proprio questo hotel e appena sono arrivato in albergo mi sono completamente deluso.
Da fuori senz'altro è un bellissimo palazzo invece all'ingresso un hotel senza personalità,senza anima,vuoto,con il servizio concierge davanti al ristorante invece la receprion si trova al 3 piano e assomiglia nient'altro che un tavolino in un bar!!!!
Secondo me non un hotel di 5 stelle non si puo permettere di accogliere gli ospiti in questo modo!!!

Inoltre la camera molto bella,col led meraviglioso,il letto molto confortevole ma l'unico difetto della stanza è la doccia(trasparente) ,perche uscendo allaghi tutta la stanza!!!

Riepilogando è un hotel di max 4 stelle in una zona centrale ma non soggiornerei qui la prossima volta, perche ci sono i posti piu belli da scegliere.",3,2011,03,16
23,5* sin escrúpulos,"De todas las tomaduras de pelo a las que los viajeros nos arriesgamos en nuestras escapadas, la peor que podamos soportar es que nos tomen por completos y absolutos idiotas. Pues esto es lo que uno siente cuando visita las instalaciones de este recinto cualificado de Hotel de 5 Estrellas, y es que ahora parece que las estrellas se compran en cualquier puesto callejero. Comprendo que el problema de no tener un equipo cualificado es muy frecuente debido a la gran demanda de personal para ocupar puestos en un mercado al alza como el de la Hostelería y la Hotelería en el que el aparato formativo de nuestro país todavía no tuvo tiempo de adaptar. Pero de ahí a que se contrate gente para atender a personas en un recinto que requiere una esmerada atención sin previamente haber recibido unos conocimientos básicos de atención al cliente me parece ya lo peor. No entraré en polemizar acerca de la decoración (bastante mejorable) , ni de los espacios para disfrutar del recinto (muy incómodos por cierto, sobre todo para personas con movilidad reducida), pero no puedo evitar lanzar el grito al cielo en cuanto a una lamentable oferta gastronómica mas propia de una tasca de polígono industrial que de un hotel de esta calificación. Entiendo que la crisis obligue a esmerar más los costos del producto en la oferta ofrecida, pero de ahí a tener que utilizar las partes más grasas y perjudiciales del cerdo como centro de una carta me parece demasiado drástico, más cuando esta estaría indicada para trabajadores del campo, construcción o minería donde su consumo calórico diario es extremadamente elevado, y ni aún así es recomendable este tipo de alimentación. La oferta del desayuno es por si escasa, triste y de muy mala calidad: el té (preparado con agua sin tratar) sabe tan raro como el nombre da la marca que utilizan, el zumo aguado de naranja es simplemente un insulto al paladar, lo del croissant a la plancha debe de ser para así intentar disimular la mala calidad del mazacote de masa mal horneada que te sirven, la mantequilla de Normandie está a años luz de la que refiere su nombre pues lo que sirven es un pedazo de pseudomargarina insípida sin envoltura que verifique su autenticidad. Y qué decir del impresentable surtido de panes, simplemente de juzgado de guardia, pero lo que culmina la desfachatez culinaria de lo que ya se había convertido en un fiasco de desayuno fue el Club Sandwich, esto si que es ya para resolución condenatoria a cadena perpetua : Pan de molde mal tostado en plancha y con dura corteza, lechuga con restos de haber sido comida por las orugas (si, con esas marquitas ondulantes de color parduzco), rodaja de tomate cortada con el centro pedicular sin extraer (es decir con la parte dura inmasticable donde el tomate se une al pedículo de la rama), pechuga de pollo (lo único medio decente del plato), un huevo asado a la plancha y como colofón dos pedazos de tocino graso de cerdo que hacen envidiar a los días de recogida de aceitunas en los olivares andaluces, eso sí el tocino con toda su grasa. Ah, y la guarnición se la debieron de comer por el camino por que por primera vez en mi vida me sirvieron un Sandwich Club sin acompañamiento (digo yo que debe de ser por que en este Club el acceso está muy restringido). Vergonzoso, simplemente vergonzoso que a los habituales usuarios de servicios de lujo nos quieran hacer entender que esta oferta es adecuada a este tipo de establecimientos, aunque uno comprende todo después de ver el aspecto de su Chef (si uno no cuida su dieta ¿Cómo va a cuidar la de los demás?).En fin otra de esas experiencias que no recomiendo pasar a nadie y que obviamente no volveré a pasar, al menos en este mismo lugar.",1,2011,02,21
