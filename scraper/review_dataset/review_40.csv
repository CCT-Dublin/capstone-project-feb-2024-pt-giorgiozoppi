40,Highly recommended,"Stayed 3 nights at this lovely 5 star boutique hotel. The friendly service was beyond our expectations. The room was spacious and our king bed had separate duvets for each of us. We enjoyed morning coffee in the courtyard, and one morning on the rooftop. Special thanks to Noa in reception who spent lots of time helping us change a train reservation. The location was great too.",5,2024,10,07
40,Really enjoyable stay at Hotel Alma,"Fab hotel. Loved our roomy room. Wonderful staff. The gym and pool were great. There was also a sauna and steam room. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Mario and Irene. 
One of the things we most enjoyed was the breakfast. Very healthy. Generous portions. Lots of fruit and berries. The eggs were very tasty and soft poached, just how we like them. Top notch coffee too. Fresh baked bread which you could toast if you wanted.

Thanks Hotel Alma. We really enjoyed our stay!!",5,2024,10,07
40,Excellent Hotel,"Really nice Hotel with attentive and gracious staff. Excellent bar,Patio and roof top! Comfortable beds, spacious bathrooms. The breakfast choices were amazing. Lots of breads a fruit as well. Confidently located in downtownish Barcelona. If you want ice you can get some!",5,2024,10,06
40,Pleasant stay,"Lovey, inviting lobby and bar with beautiful garden in courtyard. Pleasant to sit outside  for a drink, coffee  or afternoon snack. The bedrooms were spacious but lacking in good lighting of which the hotel is aware. They brought me extra lamps. The bathroom is separated from the bedroom only by a screen. If you don't mind open plan then this is a great hotel in an ideal location. Staff was very helpful and friendly. I would go back.",4,2024,10,01
40,Amazing wonderful,"Wonderful, everything was super great. Smooth check in, lovely breakfast, great location, easy to walk for historic sites,shopping, restaurants and so many things.very friendly staff to be honest you can’t find any reason to say it was okay because it was very amazing experience after all .",5,2024,09,20
40,First Time in Barcelona!,"Excellent service, the staff was very attentive and helpful as we navigated Barcelona for the first time.  We also had a welcome toast on the rooftop!  Loved the updated technology in the hotel. I also loved that it wasn't in the heart of a busy area so you could enjoy quiet time with a beautiful view. I would absolutely stay here again!",5,2024,09,05
40,Great First Visit to Barcelona,"This beautiful urban, boutique-style hotel is in a fantastic, convenient location. The lobby, restaurant, garden, and room design are all very contemporary and promote a very edgy vibe. The staff were incredibly accommodating and very service-oriented, yet were very subtle and not pushy in their approach. We would stay here again!",5,2024,09,03
40,The perfect hotel- an oasis in Barcelona,"An absolute gem right in the middle of everything - the best location ever, and yet it’s so peaceful and quiet once you walk through the doors. A true oasis.
This would have to be one of the highlights of our trip to Europe, right from the moment you arrive you feel like you’ve arrived home. The staff and service is exceptional. The room was beautifully appointed with high quality amenities, big and the bed so comfortable. Our room overlooked the little garden which was truly divine. 
We had drinks in the garden most nights before dinner and loved it .
It’s about 2 mins walk to main shopping streets and surrounded by the best restaurants in Barcelona. We walked everywhere and loved the walks along the streets of Barcelona, the location is unbeatable. The staff couldn’t do enough for us , they organised our hairdresser appointments, airport transfers both to the airport and at our destination, bookings for attractions and dinner and gave us the best tips for an amazing holiday. We can’t recommend this hotel enough. Thank you to the wonderful staff at the front desk and the door, you made our holiday very special. Ohh… and the breakfast is divine - fresh healthy and peaceful. A perfect start to the day. If you go to Barcelona, this is a perfect choice for your hotel. Can’t wait to return. I never take the time to write reviews but Hotel Alma deserves the time to share our wonderful experience.",5,2024,09,01
40,A calm in the oasis of the city! Amazing!,"What a place of calm in the hustle of the city! We had a great time - amazing breakfast options!! We had a wonderful tasting dinner which was so tasting and paired with drinks amazingly. 

A calm oasis with an amazing pool and sauna and steam. 

Loved our stay there and would love to go back!",5,2024,08,31
40,3 star service for 5 star hotel prices,"This was one of the most disappointing hotel experiences I've ever had. The staff in F&B were extremely unprofessional, and the individual at reception claiming to be the manager was particularly disrespectful. The staff showed visible disdain at our requests, pursued us with bills and repeated requests to confirm our room numbers , double-charged us, and the manager publicly accused me of not wanting to pay my fees in front of other guests.
One morning I had invited some friends the manager runs after me saying we ordered one omelet too many and he needs to charge for it.. which I didn’t mind but the manner and attitude was appalling.
mind u this is a 500 euro a night hotel and breakfast is 55 euros. No one is running away over a 15euro omelette.
On some mornings minutes after receiving our coffees at breakfast we are told the table needs to be cleared we need to leave immediately. I had recommended this hotel to our group, which booked at least 10-15 rooms, but everyone regretted the decision. For the level of service we felt overcharged and poorly treated. No apologies, no trying to rectify after staying at the hotel for a full week.
Quite shocking that hotels like this remaining in business even while charging an arm and leg. I've never written a review before, but I felt compelled to share this experience.",1,2024,08,06
40,"wonderful experience, cannot wait to return.","We had a great experience! The hotel was very classy, the staff were so  friendly and incredibly  helpful, and the room was always well kept! Attentive to every detail. Fabulous location, beautiful courtyard and restaurant. Thank you for making our trip one to remember!",5,2024,07,24
40,Amazing Hotel,This was an amazing hotel with a great location in Barcelona!  The rooms were large and clean and the staff was great.   We had a fantastic time.  They have a beautiful terrace area and there is also a great gelato place right next door.  Highly recommend staying at Hotel Alma!!,5,2024,07,12
40,This is THE place to stay in Barcelona,"One of the best hotels we’ve stayed in. Great location, extremely attentive staff, beautiful room. Breakfast offers everything you could want including healthy alternatives at the buffet and specialty items from the menu. There’s also a beautiful and very large garden area where you can have drinks in the afternoon and snack items (e.g. hummus, guacamole and terrific patatas bravas). All in all, could not recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2024,06,27
40,George,"One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. Very large room, fantastic breakfast. Minimalist decor and great architectural lighting. The inner courtyard is an oasis in the city. Its location right in the center of town next to La Pedrera and the best shopping. The staff polite and helpful",5,2024,06,25
40,"Beautiful hotel, would love to visit again","I would have given this hotel a score of 5 if they hadn’t messed up our check in by giving us the wrong room which resulted in an hour of wasted time whilst they found our luggage and then reappointed us to the right room (which wasn’t as nice as the one they originally sent us to).

The hotel was sleek, modern, beautifully clean and the rooms well appointed. 

We were there on a bed and breakfast basis although we did also dine on one of our evenings and had the 7 course tasting menu accompanied by pairing wines.

The breakfast was lovely although on the second day the service was somewhat lacking.

The tasting menu however, was fantastic! It completely surpassed our expectations. The pairing wines were excellent and the service second to none! We would absolutely recommend it and would definitely revisit if we ever got the opportunity. 

The rooftop terrace was disappointing. In fact they admitted it wasn’t officially open but if we wanted to use it we could. We did ask a member of staff to take us up there with a view to relaxing in the sun but there was nowhere to get a drink there and other than a handful of sun-beds there was nothing up there, not even a potted plant! It was quite drab to be honest. 

The pool was closed too. It didn’t really matter to us as we were only there for a couple days but other guests may have found this to be inconvenient.

The staff were lovely, polite and friendly and the hotel was very close to las Ramblas so convenient for sightseeing.",4,2024,06,15
40,Elegant Stay and Steps away from City Center.,"The hotel was perfectly positioned to make movement around the city on foot. From high in shopping to all of the must see locations. The hotel was clean, quiet and the food delicious. The pillows were fluffy and the room upkeep was on point. There was always a doorman to greet you and  give directions. The perfect spot to begin a vacation.",5,2024,06,14
40,Great experience at Hotel Alma,"Elegant yet relaxed hotel in a perfect location to serve as our base while exploring Barcelona.  Staff are friendly and professional. The garden area is tranquil and the perfect spot to relax with tapas and cava after a busy day site seeing. Loved the view of the La Predrera rooftop from our room. Also, the breakfasts they serve are amazing.",5,2024,06,12
40,Nice but super dark and awful gym!,"Very elegant and a lovely location. 
But, its dark and depressing. No lights in the rooms, not enough light. We just could not see. No full length mirror. And the gym.... for a five star hotel, I expect more. Its teeny, tiny. Enough space for one person. You have to make a reservation to use the gym because its so tiny. They just remodeled- should have expanded!!",4,2024,06,11
40,Fantastic stay!,"Alma Barcelona was a wonderful experience!  Beautiful hotel, fantastic location, rooms were great and the courtyard for breakfast and an afternoon or evening cocktail was the best!  Loved our stay here - highly recommend to everyone who visits.",5,2024,06,03
40,One of the best stays I’ve had,This has become now one of my favorite hotels in europe. Perfectly situated and a beautiful property. The staff is superb without being too formal - wonderful sense of humor and kind. The rooms are stylish but very comfortable and spacious. There is a lovely garden which is an oasis in a beautiful but busy city.,5,2024,06,02
40,Mediocre and not comfortable,"This would have been a good review except for the breakfast. We pre-paid for breakfast for 7 people for 4 days--45 euro per person per day. The breakfast manager has been rude and brusque every single day.  We order coffee and juice and never get it.  The orders are very slow, and are often just wrong--I ordered an omlet and they kept asking me if I want mushrooms and I said, ""No."" Then it came out with mushrooms and I gave up and just ate it.   If you order coffee with milk, you don't get the milk until 20 minutes after the coffee is cold.  They just don't give you water and the water glasses lie empty.  The manager lectured my brother on what to order in a rude way, suggesting he was taking too much breakfast when there are no restrictions.   45 euros is a lot for the minimal offerings and bad service. Then they try to double charge you and get you to sign something paying for breakfast again. We saw them do this to another table who had pre-paid for breakfast as well.  They also try to rush you out of there.  It's an unpleasant experience.  The rooms are dark and the beds are very firm, but they are extremely clean and minimalist.  The products are minimal but fine. Housekeeping is wonderful.  There's not a bit of dust in my room; however, my mother's housekeeper left her sink blocked up and her bathroom door would not close and it took them three days to fix it.",2,2024,05,24
40,What a wonderful stay!,"The location as such is excellent, the room was wonderful, and the breakfast proved to be really delicious. However, the staff topped everything! They were so friendly and very, very helpful! Thank you! We will come back. Best regards from Zurich.",5,2024,05,20
40,Charming and intimate experience,"The room size was good; some other hotels in the same category I stayed at had tighter rooms. I always appreciate full-length windows, particularly when overlooking a beautiful backyard garden. In general, the food and service were very good.",4,2024,05,17
40,Not a 5 * experience,"Pros: nice room, nice bed
Cons: check in congested
            Breakfast congested , had have it in the bar, and poor selection
            Only 1 restaurant 
           Three people entered my room at 10.30pm!11 The reception gave my room keys to someone else. No come back from the hotel even though I alerted them to the issue, not up to standard

Would not stay again and would recommend Majestic or Ohla.",2,2024,05,01
40,First Class All the Way.,"Concierge Staff worked extremely hard to insure your stay was first class. From housekeeping, restaurant, bar, etc the personnel were friendly, professional, with you being their # 1 goal. First Class all the way!",5,2024,04,30
40,Perfect!,"Beautiful hotel, very comfortable room, gracious and friendly staff, and located in a safe, lovely area of Barcelona. 
Would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2024,04,21
40,A Beautiful Hotel in a Nice Area of Barcelona,"Hotel Alma is a beautiful 5 Star hotel located in a very nice part of Barcelona surrounded by high end shops. The hotel is beautiful inside and out. The staff is excellent, kind, helpful and willing to go the extra mile. They serve an incredible breakfast every morning with fresh squeezed juices, fresh fruits, pastries, breads, meats and cheeses, as well as cooked to order items off the menu.  The restaurant serves an excellent lunch and dinner daily and there is a bar in the lobby as well. The hotel has a beautiful garden to the rear, it's surrounded by other buildings, but you'd never know it. 

My hotel room was large (especially for European standards) and the mattress comfortable, but firm. If you refer a soft mattress, you may want to request a mattress topper.  The rooms and most of the hotel, has beautiful hard wood floors throughout. The shower was large and tall, a 7+ foot person would have duct to shower. The towels were large and fully. They even service your room twice a day (who does that anymore?)

My only issue with the hotel is that it is very dark inside. The colors are dark (black, dark brown. dark green, etc.) and all the lighting is diffused and indirect. Even in the rooms, it's very dark. Again, the lights are indirect and/or diffused. There are lights on the mirror, but it was like they were dimmed or low voltage, making it difficult to see yourself in the mirror.  

Overall it's a lovely hotel in a great neighborhood and highly recommended.",5,2024,04,18
40,Amazing,"How wonderful experience with Alma Barcelona! The station is perfect, I could go to Gaudí on foot. Their service is excellent. The staffs are very nice and helpful. They do house keeping two or three times everyday, that makes me feel comfortable. They helped me to rent a car go to tossa, safe and convenient .  I will be back!",5,2024,04,18
40,No bathroom door,"Love the location and food. Staff are very helpful.  The man who is at the breakfast room  who consign tables and the waiter with beard are not quite welcomed  Asian, in my opinion.  Not quite friendly .  However, The other waiter, the man with shaved head is so polite and friendly though.  Also, the waitress who served me for breakfast is so friendly and helpful. I should have asked her name as she shows us how she has service mind .  Unlike the two guys I talked about.     Talking about room; Room is well appointed; however, there’s not a convenience for separate toilet, not in the same area of bathroom.  Moreover, , there is no bathroom door on the main bathroom for shower and sink room. No shower door and bathroom which is too hip for me.  When taking shower, it’s so cold even if we have turned off the air conditioning.  Towels provided only big and the long towels for each persons which are two each. Usually in other hotels, there always are 3 sets of towels though.  In addition, No hand towels to dry hands  or to wipe the wetness on the sink.  Tissue box is put outside of bathroom.  Only one small tissue box per room.  This is the unpleasant things which we don’t like.  The rest is superb.",4,2024,04,16
40,Great place to stay in wonderful location.,"Amazing hotel with lovely and helpful staff, wonderful location, great food and fabulous cocktails! We spent a great weekend at Hotel Alma and would definitely return but hopefully for longer in the future as we didn’t have time to experience the spa.",5,2024,04,15
40,Absolutely delightful and decadent stay,"Sublime and decadent. Outstanding service. Kind and thoughtful touches throughout. Super location and close to a lot of landmarks. Easy to grab a cab or walk. Right off Passeig de Gràcia. Two things this American found odd: it’s super dark inside everywhere but still tasteful, and housekeeping does not knock but rather enters the room and then announces self. So be advised 😂. Absolutely worth the money and experience",5,2024,04,09
40,Lovely Hotel,The room was perfect. The people at the front desk were so helpful. The beds were yummy. Best sleep. Breakfast was included with our stay. When we arrived they actually asked if we would like a glass of champagne. The bar area was a delight. They have an outside area to sit as well.,5,2024,04,03
40,Staff were very friendly and helpful.,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. They made any reservations and taxi bookings that I needed. The hotel was very clean and tidy. The superior room was amazing and we had more than enough space. The location of the hotel is perfect for food, shopping and getting around the city",5,2024,04,01
40,Magical Hotel,"This hotel is magical. The rooms are spacious, immaculate, and comfortable. The staff is phenomenal. They are dedicated to customer service and it shows. The outdoor bar is peaceful and relaxing. We will definitely return to this hotel when in Barcelona.",5,2024,03,26
40,A nice place but some unpleasant moments to my stay,"The reception team were really friendly and welcoming on arrival and the breakfast was lovely. However on the first night someone came into my room at 2am in the morning and woke me up and nobody in reception could explain to me who/ how or why someone had managed to get into my room at the middle of the night. On the second day I was followed through the lobby by a staff member who rudely asked me what I was doing there, clearly feeling like I didn’t look like I should be there and I had to produce my room key - he then looked embarrassed but said no apology.",2,2024,03,22
40,Sublime,"We stayed at the Alma Hotel for 7 days.  Our stay was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. Staff were warm, welcoming and helpful.  The room was spacious and elegantly appointed, and the location could not have been better.  

Best of all, the food was fantastic!  The breakfast served was amazing in terms of the variety and quality of offerings:  fresh fruit at the peak of ripeness; pastries to die for;  magnificent freshly baked breads;  and, omelettes that were a source of awe. 

Other things we especially appreciated — it was very quiet.  The bathtub was fabulous.",5,2024,03,18
40,A++ Alma,"Exceptional service, food, room quality and location. Staff was always present, knowledgeable and helpful. The prices were also quite reasonable in comparison to other luxury hotels in the area. I will always stay at the Alma on my future visits to Barcelona.",5,2024,03,12
40,Amazing experience with Alma,"I stayed in Alma for three nights and it’s completely meet my expectations. It is very well located, close to the main attractions but in the quiet area. The design and attention to the details is just above all praises. They also serve an amazing breakfast and have a small but very nice Spa inside. The staff was very helpful and friendly, definitely gonna be back again",5,2024,03,10
40,Amazing Hotel in a great location,"The service at Alma is amazing. Everyone anticipates what you need and they provide it even before you have to ask. We upgraded to an executive suite and it was worth it. Plenty of space and amazing bathroom. The pool and gym were excellent as they could be reserved just for us. My family was so happy being there. I have been to Barcelona several times but it was the first time for my wife and daughter. We would go out and they would ask ""when can we go back to the hotel?"" because they loved it there so much. The breakfast is as amazing as all the reviews say. My daughter would wake up and the first words were ""is it breakfast time yet?"" Alma is an amazing hotel and I highly recommend it.

The ""downsides"" of the hotel are that the room service is really expensive. Also, the pillows are a bit funky in that they are either too firm or too soft. Both of these things do not detract from the experience. Truly a wonderful stay.",5,2024,03,05
40,"Stylish , comfortable, and centrally located hotel with highly personalized service!","Excellent location, fantastic personalized service, attentive staff on all levels, beautiful and art decorated interiors, cleanness and comfort of this hotel made our stay in Barcelona unforgettable.
The restaurant offers variety of choices for breakfast but also fine dining for lunch and dinner.",5,2024,03,04
40,A touch of luxury in the heart of Barcelona,Everything about this hotel is pure class. The rooms are large and airy ( we had a deluxe room) a special thank you to all the staff who make you feel special. The location is very good and feels much safer and quieter than Las Rambles where we also stayed. Fully recommend the restaurant in the hotel if you want authentic fresh local cuisine.,5,2024,03,04
40,Excellent,"Alma Hotel is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in, we highly recommend it. It’s privately owned and operated; therefore, their services and their hospitality is truly a five star rating, even plus. Staff are extremely friendly, professional, and caring. Rooms are elegantly decorated and clean. The restaurant has a Michelin chef and the bar and patio is elegantly attractive.
In short, it is indeed and truly a wonderful place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,02,20
40,best hotel in Barcelona,"Best hotel ever ! I stayed at ALMA for 6 nights. I highly recommend this luxury hotel Beautiful and spacious room with a city view , excellent bed, delicious breakfast , friendly and helpful staff , super well located , can't wait to be back .

40,An Absolute Gem in Barcelona,"Totally understated class, great staff, lovely demure decor, book the leisure complex exclusively for yourself and a brilliant chef who produced a delicious tasting menu just for us veggies. Located right next to all the designer shops, loved by my wife! Will definitely return for another chilling weekend when life in the U.K. becomes too much again.",5,2024,02,11
40,Relaxed and quiet luxury just off the Passeig de Gracia.,"The hotel is in a fanatic location just off the Passeig de Gracia. Our room (grand deluxe on the second floor) overlooked the garden at the rear of the hotel, and was quiet and comfortable. The lighting is very subdued which we appreciated, although it was a slight challenge walking down the stairwell. 

The walk-in shower was powerful and spacious, and it was nice to have a bath in the room. The king bed was comfortable but we would have preferred one large duvet rather than two separate single duvets.

The complimentary minibar was topped up twice daily. A kettle was provided upon request. We enjoyed the breakfast but felt it was expensive and so opted to go elsewhere for the rest of our trip. There is certainly plenty of choice nearby. 

We have stayed twice at Alma now and overall really enjoyed our time there. We would definitely stay there again, although we might be tempted to try one of the other luxury hotels on our next trip.",5,2024,02,10
40,Sublime,"We are just back from a sublime stay at one of our favourite hotels in one of our favourite cities. The frenetic pace of life in this metropolis is only endurable by being able to recharge the batteries in this haven of calm and tranquility. The staff are amazing - so professional but human. Special thanks for their service above and beyond the call of duty go to Miguel, Francisco and Alex at reception and also to Aldo who accompanied us so far into the airport with our bags that I thought he was also going to fly us home........",5,2024,02,07
40,Long weekend at the Alma Barcelona,"We had a lovely long weekend at Alma Barcelona, staying in a grand suite room on the 4th floor.  The hotel is excellent, ideally located with a decent but intimate restaurant and relaxing outside area. We had one evening meal whilst there, as well as breakfast each day - all were great! Hotel staff were really helpful and professional, and enabled us to make the most of our short stay.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time to use the spa facilities but always next time!",5,2024,02,02
40,Five star hotel with even better service,"A beautiful hotel centrally located to shopping, near the Gothic quarter and so many of the best sites within Barcelona. There is almost no need to get in a car when staying at the Alma as so much is within walking distance. 

But beyond the location was the gracious and attentive staff. It was personal touches from the warm staff that made our holiday trip so special. From the front door to the cleaning staff, everyone was so nice and professional. They made us feel as if we’d known them for years even though it was our first (but not last) stay there. 

We can’t wait to return to the Alma.",5,2024,01,04
40,Falling in Love with Barcelona ,"From the time we got there, to the time we left, the stay at the Alma hotel was amazing.  The staff was always welcoming and very responsive to any requests. Including breakfast delivered to our room, earlier than service time, due to an early departure.  The espresso martinis at the bar were/and still are the best I have ever had.  ",5,2023,12,01
40,Fantastic stay lovely hotel highly recommended ,"Loved this hotel. All the staff are super helpful and very friendly.  Had 2 lovely meals, including a 5 course tasting menu paired wine, excellent.    The desert was one of the nicest deserts I have ever had! The hotel had a calm and peaceful vibe, with modern decoration. The rooms was lovely, plent of space and a huge comfortable bed. Located very centrally within easy walking distance of all the main attractions and a few steps from the main shopping street. Highly recommended.  I would absolutely stay again. ",5,2023,11,12

Housekeeping is not great 
The location is very good

The sun deck is nice 
The spa is ok, but we have seen better ",3,2023,11,05
40,Great staff make a great hotel,"I had a fantastic stay in Alma Barcelona, location great, rooms are great, garden is very pleasant, breakfast, lunch and dinner all really good. But most important; all the people that work there are great, very helpful, very friendly and they try to make you feel at home. This is the main reason why this is my favourite hotel in Barcelona. Regards, Joof Verhees",5,2023,11,04
40,Very nice hotel with great service!,"located across Louis Vuitton Store, no noise from street. Excellent customer service, was helped by LIDIA-super welcomed lady. super delicious and healthy breakfast. Sauna and pool very nice BUT Very Slippery Floor, it’s not safe and liability issue! Bed pillows are not comfortable, not l possible for quality sleep, need be to be replaced.  Other than that very recommended. ",5,2023,10,24
40,Good hotel with some issues ,"This hotel has some great things going for it, but also a few negatives. First, the best part is the location. Very central in one of the top parts of Barcelona. Walking distance to amazing restaurants, shops, and Casa Mila. Safe area. Could not be happier with the location. Hotel is very quiet and sleek. There were some difficulties with our stay however. The biggest being WIFI. It is very inconsistent throughout the hotel. I would definitely not recommend this place for an important work trip. Second, service, while friendly, was slow. It seemed like they were understaffed. For example, we had an issue with our room that took hours to resolve. Also, once it was resolved, nobody checked in on us.  Not a big deal, but would have been nice.
As others have mentioned, rooms are modern, but they are very dark. The bathroom lighting is so dim, expect to get ready in the dark. Also important to note, we  sat in the back garden and both got about 4-5 mosquito bites each. ",3,2023,10,19
40,Barcelona 2023,Lovely. hotel in great location. The patio bar is the best!  Lovely outside with great service.  We also had services in the spa which were great.  Very attentive staff!  Would definitely stay there again.  ,5,2023,10,15
40,Good Location ,"The hotel is centrally located in a  beautiful neighbor..   I could walk to the Sagrada Familia.  Also, walk to coffee shops and restaurants.   The  subway is only one block away as well as the buses.  I  took the buses and subway to get to other areas.  The staff is friendly.  The reception staff able to answer  questions and give recommendations.   I am giving it a 4 due to the hotel being a bit dark, dim lighting ..  Also,  the maids were not consistent in replacing items in the mini bars,  especially the water,   Also , towels and toilet paper.  ",4,2023,10,13
40,Graceful & Quiet Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Alma Barcelona in the Eixample District of Barcelona. We were steps from the busy Passeig de Gracia but unaware as the Alma is a very quiet oasis with a large, laid back garden. All the hotel staff were truly helpful & hospitable. (Among many plusses, the windows actually open if you want fresh air.) The interiors and amenities are all fairly new/modern (e.g., lots of black & low lighting in the interiors) but the building itself appears to be older and had a ""Monument"" designation at the front door.  (I never had time to find out why.)  My only frustration was that I elected to use fingerprint recognition instead of an electronic door pass and was frequently stuck at the elevator or my room door.  I could have gotten a door pass but did not have enough motivation.  This is a very good find.",5,2023,10,13
40,"Our stay in the hotel ALMA, Barcelona","Everything was amazing. It was wonderful to stay in this hotel. The hotel service and staff were very friendly. I express my personal best wishes to them.

40,Great location and staff,"We had a wonderful stay and staff were friendly, the location was terrific for our stay and nearby so everything was within walking distance. Our room was comfortable with a terrific breakfast. Our first stay in Spain. We were out enjoying the tapas and amazing architecture right away.",5,2023,09,22
40,5 star perfection,"The experience was one of total perfection. The staff couldn't do more to make us feel more welcome and ensure our experience was a perfect one. 
The hotel is beautiful, with art and fabulous décor through out. 

We were welcomed on arrival and check in with drinks whilst we checked in, then as we were earlier then the given check in time on arrival, we were invited to the garden to enjoy a complimentary welcome drink while the hotel made sure our room was made ready. 

The concierge came out to us and informed us our room had been made ready and told us our bags had already been taken to the room. 

Upon entering the room, we were greeted with yet more art, stylish furniture and beautiful fixtures and fittings to ensure our total comfort. The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom and with bath, twin sinks and massive shower was a dream. The mini bar stocked with water, soft drinks and a couple of local beers, Perfecto!

We had robes, slippers and extremely fluffy towels, and a massive bed with great pillows. It was perfect in every way. 

We left the room to head out for dinner on the first night, and when we came back, our room had been made up again, and the mini bar replenished and  extra complimentary water and chocolate placed on the bedside tables. This was un-expected, but so very welcome!

On our second night, we stayed at the hotel for dinner and enjoyed the most amazing  8 course tasting menu with paired wines. The dinner, the service, everything was amazing and it made our time and experience a magical one. A lady called Maria looked after us that night, and she was amazing. Once we had finished dinner, and after expressing my shear enjoyment at everything, how it was so artisanal, beautifully presented, lovingly crafted and carefully considered meal, I wanted to pass my compliments to the chef, and the maître d asked the chef to see us, so we had the opportunity to thank him in person for the amazing work he does and for what had been prepared for us to enjoy that night. 
I hope it made him feel good to see how his guests enjoyed the dinner he prepared, as he deserved to feel good about it. It made the whole night feel so personal. It was just amazing!

We enjoyed dinner in the garden, which was so peaceful and relaxing. It was serene and added to the experience. 

I paid top money for our experience and the overall trip to Barcelona at a charity ball dinner, and this experience was part of the package of prizes that were available to bid on at the dinner that night, with some of the money I paid going to charity. 
I chose to bid on this experience as it looked to be just the type of thing we'd enjoy, and I am so glad I won it. It was worth every penny! 

I would not hesitate to stay at the Alma again as a normal guest, and I hope to so in the near future. 

Thank you all at the Alma for making us feel so special and welcomed to the beautiful city of Barcelona and your amazing hotel. I will see you again soon.

40,Great boutique hotel!,"Finishing our last night of a 5 day trip here. Its our second stay, and it was equally as wonderful. Very low key place, staff is incredibly friendly and helpful,  pretty design, and a really nice courtyard in the back. I emailed ahead asking for early check-in since we were coming overnight from another country and would be tired and they responded quickly and helped accommodate! We booked their larger rooms both times and would recommend, very spacious and nice. Only one recommendation is if you have the option, the rooms on the courtyard side are quieter than the street side. Not that street side is bad, but there is light road noise on that side. 
Overall a really wonderful hotel and I would recommend it to all. ",5,2023,09,12
40,Great Hotel,"Kind, considerate and attentive staff.  Great rooms. Very happy with my stay relative to other hotels I’ve stayed at in the area. Close to everything you want to be close to and the staff was really great ",5,2023,08,22
40,Fantastic boutique hotel,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Alma hotel. A boutique  hotel with beautiful, stylish interiors and bedrooms. We had a spacious bedroom, looking onto the rear garden, which was surprisingly quiet. There is also a large hotel garden, which offers a tranquil haven in the city, especially in summer. Central location of the hotel meant that we could walk everywhere! Special mention to the taster menu experience that we had in the restaurant. We had the most fantastic dishes, superb wine and personal service throughout the meal from the lovely and knowledgeable Maria. Highly recommend and would definitely return to the Alma! ",5,2023,08,20
40,Our family enjoyed our stay,"The swimming pool is very kids friendly, it’s by appointment so we can enjoy the pool/gym by ourselves. Room is spacious and the garden brings tranquility. The only thing we didn’t like was the stairs to lobby, we have to carry the stroller every time we enter the hotel, doorman was nice and helpful, helped us carry the stroller all the time.",5,2023,08,10

40,"Peaceful, stylish and luxurious stay in the perfect location","From the moment I booked to the moment we left the service at this beautiful hotel was impeccable, such kindness and attention to detail. The room was such a restorative space, beautiful wooden floor, calm lighting, huge comfortable bed, luxurious bathroom. Love the Aesop products too. A lovely lady came to offer us water and chocolates each night too! 

The spa was heavenly, really spacious hot sauna, wonderful big showers for cold splashes, long and shallow pool for floating and morning lengths. We barely saw another person even though the hotel was full. It’s such a well designed calm space, and the only hotel I could find with a beautiful garden, perfect for grounding, tea and cocktails and more.

I researched over twenty Barcelona hotels and am so glad I chose this one.",5,2023,05,20

40,An Oasis in the City,"Stayed here for 2 nights and from the moment we arrived we loved it. The staff are all so helpful and welcoming, can't do enough for you. The hotel itself is so calming, it's super modern without being vulgar and has simple touches everywhere to take away the bustle if Barcelona. The rooms have everything you need, we were in 306. Complimentary mini bar which was stocked with plenty water, juice and coke zero. Lovely views into the garden below, where it is lovely just to sit and relax. We both had massages which were great. Breakfast is lovely, they cook a great poached egg! If you want a hotel which is calming and so relaxing, not like some of the huge chain hotels, this is the place for you.....we loved it! Thank you. ",5,2023,05,08
40,Skip this one,"The room we stayed in was very dark. There was a barrier between the bed and the sink and too dark to apply makeup. Although a light was brought in, it did nothing to brighten the room. There was also no makeup mirror(I had to request one) so at least I could move to a table by a table by a lamp. For the price of this hotel, it was insulting to charge 90 Euros a couple for breakfast—which wasn’t very good. And wouldn’t it be nice to have a full length mirror?  This wasn’t a 2 star hotel. We asked the concierge to obtain a taxi for us for dinner, many hours prior to us leaving. We believe she forgot and we missed our reservation. The bartenders and staff were very nice and the room we stayed in large and clean ..those are the positives.",2,2023,05,06

40,A gem of a hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel. The staff is incredibly helpful; every day it felt like coming home to our own apartment in a busy city. The room was beautiful, with very comfortable bedding. It also was extremely QUIET which is a huge bonus. 

Breakfast was included in our room; I highly recommend it. We also had tapas in the garden twice. Even though they were a little expensive, the ambiance was worth it. We also had dinner in the restaurant on our last night. I think they were a little in the weeds (in terms of service - the chef was bringing out the food at times) but the food was delicious.

The restaurant exquisite the rice we enjoy.

40,Amazing stay at the Alma Hotel in Barcelona,We planned a trip for our 10 year anniversary for 2 nights and we had an amazing time. The hotel is of High Quality and our room was just outstanding. The staff where on hand all the time and so helpful. The restaurant food was the best you can get and the spa facilities where very good.,5,2023,02,01
40,Peaceful,I stayed at the Alma for one night on business. It was a very smooth experience and the location was central/convenient for my trip. Most importantly I slept like a baby and loved the breakfast buffet -- would recommend!,5,2023,01,18
40,My second home in Barcelona,"I love everything in this hotel. Friendly and professionnal staff. High level service. Perfect location. The garden in the middle of barcelona is a must. Teh restaurant is very good. The bar is cosy and really pro too. Breakfast is a must : lot of choices with all high level quality. Local products and all home made fresh bakeries. You can't miss the breakfast.
Plus : the valet service in the middle of Barcelona. 
No doubt : Alma hotel is my second location.",5,2023,01,18
40,Beautiful oasis in the center of Barcelona,"Alma is an understated intimate luxury hotel which is around the corner from Passeig de Gracia, where all the top fashion and luxury boutiques are located. 
The minimalist rooms are of a good size, quiet, and well designed. 
Besides a gym and spa, there is a pool which you have to book your solo slot for. Swimming in that pool was heavenly. 
The Alma has a top notch restaurant with a garden, which I still have to try. If the outstanding breakfast (lots of appetizing and healthy choices, the Bikini Alma sandwich with Iberico ham, Brie and truffles was out of this world) is anything to go by, dinner should be amazing. 
The best part is the staff. They are warm and welcoming starting with the lovely and helpful doormen, reception, bar and breakfast. The breakfast team are especially to be commended during this stay and my prior one. 
I can’t wait to come back again!",5,2023,01,09
40,"A Gem with outstanding service, Home away from Home","We had the pleasure on staying for an extended stay in the Alma Hotel over the NY 2022/23. 

From the 1st contact to receive suggestions regarding restaurants, museums, etc which had been handled swiftly and to our fullest satisfaction, the staff kept fulfilling any and all of our wishes, throughout our stay.

Located right in the heart of Barcelona,  simply perfect in regards to closeness to shops, top restaurants and sights. 

Design is very elegant, chique, classical and modernist. Pleasant reception area to relax, clever bar and breakfast areas. Rooms to the courtyard, very sizeable, spacious and well planned. In summer' outdoor sitting in spacious courtyard under the trees must be wonderful.

Spa  and gym area very pleasant and functional, with pool.

A place were we will definately return to with great pleasures.",5,2023,01,05
40,"No communication from hotel around reservation, not 5-stars. ","The communication from this hotel leading up to your reservation is completely non-existent. Do not expect any communication around booking spa treatments, asking about special accommodations, and most importantly, confirming your reservation.

I had originally booked a reservation for late December in early September. My travel dates changed a couple of times so I had to cancel and rebook twice. When my trip to Barcelona got moved altogether, I went to cancel one of the reservations on Nov 12th. I mistakenly forgot about my other reservation for different dates that I made when my travel schedule was still uncertain.

Leading up to the reservation date, I was never contacted by the hotel for anything at all that would have alerted me that I still had an existing reservation. Not even a “we’re looking forward to your upcoming stay” email. The hotel never even contacted me after I did not show up to see if we were safe. The only reason I know I still had a reservation was the hotel charged $400+ on my credit card.

When I called to try to explain what happened, the hotel staff was unable to speak to me in English which is strange for a 5-star hotel. Ultimately, the hotel was unwilling to work with me on the $400+ charge they placed on my credit card.

I would not recommend this hotel as their communication is not up to the standard of a 5-star hotel.",1,2022,12,26
40,Flawless stay.,"Absolutely flawless service with a constant smile.  Not pretentious at all and simply genuine concern to make our stay comfortable and relaxing.   I would highly recommend and fully understand why this hotel is ranked #1 in Trip Advisor.  From the check in, to the beautiful rooms, history or the hotel, excellent breakfasts and top notch concierge service.  They are simply the best.",5,2022,12,13
40,Outstanding!,"Best part of our Barcelona trip, was Alma hotel and the staff! 
The room is clean, stylish, beautiful, comfortable, and pleasant. The bed is super comfortable it's hard to get out! 
The breakfast is great, and the staff are so kind and accommodating!",5,2022,12,11
40,Amazing from A to Z,"I stayed at the Alma Barcelona for 4 nights. I absolutely loved it!! 
The staff was amazing and friendly. 
Breakfast, Lunch and dinner was delicious and waiters were always smiley. 
Bedroom was big and everything complimentary!
Amazing from A to Z!!",5,2022,12,05
40,Fantastic Pre-Cruise Stay,"Was interested in finding a well located nice location for our four day visit before our transatlantic cruise out of the port at Barcelona and this hotel caught our eye given the reviews here and the central location (we like to walk).

The staff was very accommodating and made our room available early upon arrival from the airport.  As others have stated, the style is modern but very comfortable. The property is spotless.

Our room was good sized and the bathroom includes a separate tub and rain shower.  Bedding was very comfortable and our room overlooked the garden.

Yes, the property has an outdoor garden/courtyard with bar service and restaurant.

Bar service was great.

We had room service one evening and dined at the on property, Jardín del Alma. Very good. Thoroughly enjoyed all.  

As others have stated, the property is very nice and has a great, quite location.  The staff was superior from the initial greeting and checkin, the bar and restaurant and housekeeping. Fantastic stay and would recommend to any and defiantly will return when we next travel to Barcelona.",5,2022,11,27
40,Stylish friendly hotel,"Stunning hotel, fabulous staff, amazing restaurant, well done! Really enjoyed our visit. Had a superb lunch in the restaurant and we were so well looked after by the staff throughout. Hotel is brilliantly located in the centre of the city.",5,2022,11,27
40,"Charming, elegant, personalized hotel in gorgeous Barcelona neighborhood.","The hotel is charming and elegant, and much more personalized than a large chain.  The finishes and products were lovely.  The neighborhood was unbeatable and the hotel staff recommended a fantastic restaurant just a five minute walk from the hotel.",5,2022,11,16
40,Excellent hotel made even better by exceptional staff,"Cannot fault this hotel. From arrival - you were made to feel welcome. Rooms are lovely - clean and have a mini bar and nice coffee facilities. Breakfast was exceptional with range of hot and cold choices. However, the element that takes this hotel above many others that have equally nice rooms and food is the staff. They were so helpful and engaged. We arrived late and tired and were immediately offered a complimentary drink and told about the facilities. Fingerprint room access is a bit of a gimmick (but i like gimmicks so completely happy with that). Went to the bar after for some food and again the staff were helpful and informative. Like a lot of things in life - place can be nice but it will always be the staff that make it or break it. Definitely hope to come back.",5,2022,11,13
40,Outstanding hotel option in Barcelona,"A fantastic hotel in the central area of Barcelona. What I love of the Alma is the obsession behind the quality of every little detail. This makes the stay there absolutely stunning. The breakfast is excellent, and it perfectly addresses the requirements of every type of guest.",5,2022,11,13
40,Touring Barcelona Spain,"It was to our great surprise to  have had the opportunity to stay in the best motel in the city that was located perfectly by everything that were were touring in Barcelona!  It must be in the heart of Barcelona as we could walk everywhere safely!  
Food at their personal restaurant was just absolutely exquisitely tasty.  Truly loved those breakfast meals!  
The rooms were beautiful and so comfortable!  I loved those shutters that we could close off all light and found we rested extremely well!  
The bath tub and shower were so perfect… as the water was a wonderful speed.  
The toilet closet had its own awesome lay out that is a must see and appreciated by us.  
It was so easy to have room service to care for our needs… as they visit our room every day to keep it picked up.   
And we ended our last day in the most convenient well put together Spa downstairs.   It has swimming, and a gym with the dry sauna and the steam sauna.  We were able to gain our last meditation and relaxation in that room. .. and all that made our stay in Barcelona perfect!
Believe that where you stay will satisfy the days.  And the Alma definitely was the best of our stays.",5,2022,11,12
40,A calm oasis in the city,"From the moment we entered, the staff members were fantastic—very attentive, kind and professional. Our room was quiet and spacious — modernist but not cold. The shower was a dream — just the right amount of water pressure. And the products (Malin + Goetz) smelled so good. Booking the spa was easy, and I was grateful to not have to share the space, and just enjoy the solitude. The pool was even big enough to swim in, and the two saunas (wet and dry) were a great way to end the spa session. It was a calm oasis in a busy city. The breakfast was also incredible — so many options to choose from, in a beautiful garden setting. It was a space to make the most of. Highly recommended.",5,2022,11,06
40,Best stay ever,"There are not enough superlatives to describe our wonderful experience.  Everything about it was exceptional.  The helpful staff, the facilities, the food, the location.  We were there with 10 business associates who would all say the same.",5,2022,11,01
40,Sadly not a 5 star experience,"We did enjoy our stay at the hotel In Barcelona and were pleased with the wonderful breakfast buffet and a la carte ordering and the fantastic woman from Brazil who served eggs for us. She was amazing. Also we found our suite to be very clean and spacious. 

However, I was rather disappointed with the general atmosphere in the hotel - an atmosphere that is generated nad created by the people who work there and meet the guests. 

Check-in service flawed
For example, the check-in procedure and the way we were welcomed was not a memorable one. The person at the front desk did not seem to care much about us or the hotel. Checking us in seemed like a task that just needed to be done as fast as possible. Also, we were not offered a glass of wine or coffee as I saw other guests were. 

In general we are used to a much more personal and intimate atmosphere in the hotels we stay in. We mostly stay at 5 star hotels around the world and I must sadly point out that the front desk service is not a five star service/experience according to our experience.

The hotel needs to upgrade that experience and make the guests feel welcome. 

In general the staff except for the Brazilian woman seemed like they wanted to be somewhere else than at work, Which is a s sad thing to remember about Alma. 

However, we liked the room and the garden but will probably chooe another hotel next time.

AND the hotel has not even responded to the mail we sent them before making a Tripadvisor review - that says it all. ",3,2022,10,18
40,Incredible Experience!,"This hotel is really special - the staff are so welcoming, kind, and helpful.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with really nice touches like a privacy screen on the windows.  The housekeeping staff was beyond, and the room was made up so nicely at night.  There is a spa and a gym, both available to use by appointment for privacy.  The staff have these really wonderful gestures, such as opening the door for you every time you exit and enter - I did not touch a door once!  The restaurant is lovely, the bar is excellent for relaxing, and the bartender makes a delicious espresso martini.  I cannot wait to return!",5,2022,10,08
40,Outstanding,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. The entire staff was friendly and very helpful. The location is perfect and the rooms are large. 
The restaurant is a gem. Breakfast every day was incredible and dinner was extraordinary.
We will definitely stay again.",5,2022,10,01
40,"Alma... A ""Soul"" for Barcelona","Alma hotel in Barcelona is very well located. It gives you walking access to all you want to do in Barcelona. Staff at reception desk is very well trained and very nice. Check-in was done efficiently and without problems. Rooms are well fixed, nice toiletries for the bathroom, comfortable bed and pillows. Breakfast was well served and with great variety. Don't miss the detox juice... excellent.
The restaurant is expensive (we had dinner there) and the food was not memorable. Good ambiance but nothing to write home about.
Two factors that detracted from our stay; the air condition had trouble at nights (or it was turned off during the late night for energy saving) which made the room hot and not very comfortable. Also, the bar lacks variety of liquors (didn't have JW Black label which is a standard in any bar).
Not a economic alternative but among the competitors for sure a great option.",4,2022,10,01
40,Super cool backyard and one of the best locations,"Love the Alma. We have stayed there over the years many times. Lovely decoration,
spacious rooms and that backyard in the middle of Barna is to die for! The staff are very professional and wonderful, it is a better option than one of the big hotels.",5,2022,09,20

I have no complaints worthy of mentioning here

40,Best hotel ever,We spent 3 nights at Hotel Alma. It was literally the best hotel ever. Our room was spotless. The bed was so comfortable. The shower was strong. The staff were at their best at all times. They made us feel so incredibly welcome. Nothing was too much for them. Laundry turn around within a few hours. The food was absolutely amazing. The taste and the availability. During the day I just ordered what I felt like having and they somehow just created it. We cannot think of one negative thing to say. To all staff at Hotel Alma thank you so much. We were emotional leaving you and will definitely be back.,5,2022,09,13
40,Beautiful oasis of calm,"A real oasis of serenity, luxury and calm. Very attentive staff. Beautifully appointed rooms. Loved our stay here. The tasting menu was divine.

40,About breakfast and check out,"The design was nice.very minimalistic and even swimming pool was dope.but not big nor so private feeling.
And we couldn’t get breakfast but we couldn’t get any vouchers too and had to pay lunch even coffee and orange juice…
And 12:00 check out time they calling the room for twice.this kind 5 stars hotel should be chill vibes for check out time.",3,2022,08,27

40,Exceptional stay.,"We spent one night in this hotel prior to boarding a cruise. It is small and friendly with exceptional and professional staff. We recommend the Jardin Del Alma highly having eaten lunch, dinner and breakfast. We have stayed in many 5* establishments during our travels and rate this one of the best.",5,2022,07,22
40,Amazing sanctuary in Barcelona,"We regret that we only had one night at this stylish and delightful hotel in the heart of Barcelona. From the moment we arrived we were treated with such grace and the amazing Alexandra on reception was an absolute gem. My husband had contacted the hotel before we arrived, as it was my birthday. Alexandra went above and beyond to organise flowers and champagne in our room as a surprise. Our room was gorgeous - very spacious and had a wonderful view over the courtyard with a large window that opened! The breakfast was delicious and overall the whole experience was wonderful. I would highly recommend this hotel - the area is also amazing for shopping!",5,2022,07,19
40,Top notch,"Some outstanding features that very few if any other hotels in Barcelona can replicate. Their brilliant team - like a United Nations and I counted people from India, Pakistan, Ecuador, Venezuela and surely many others. Selene at Concierge, the excellent masseuse, the Indian hostess at the restaurant with excellent suggestions were all very good and took good care of everyone with great charm. The garden area is the high point - magical, tranquil, clean, very well laid out, comfortable, and a place that feels like home. Rooms are clean - but for some reason they were really skimping on soaps and shampoos. Restaurant and bar menu could include more options but overall a very good experience and a repeat venue.",4,2022,07,02

40,Friendly staff & amazing food.,"Hotel Alma is in a great location in the heart of downtown, round the corner from Casa Battlo & La Pedrera. The room was lovely with the huge shower & bath big enough for 2 my favourite. The staff were friendly & couldn't do enough for us. The courtyard was a relaxing oasis & a great spot for an early evening gin & tonic. The food was amazing with generous breakfast included. On our first night we had a 7 course dinner in the restaurant which was delicious, featuring seasonal local produce with wine chosen by the sommelier. We would love to come back again.",5,2022,05,10

40,Heavenly,"On our 3rd day at the hotel, my wife asked me if I had noticed how the room had nothing that could induce a reaction in people with allergies. It's true. None of those draperies, useless bed runner, little carpets, and annoying decorative pillows that other hotels bother us with. This room was simply perfect: clean, beautiful, one of the quietest (if not the quietest) hotel rooms we've ever been to. The staff is incredibly nice and responsive. We haven't tried the restaurant or the spa, so I can't comment on those.
So, the location is absolutely perfect, in the center of it all, but with a room facing the garden in the back, you'll feel you're in an oasis of quietness. I recommend it.",5,2022,05,07

40,A perfect hotel in every way,This is a wonderful place to stay right in the centre of everything. The service is exemplary and nothing was too much trouble. My only little niggle is the fingerprint system to open doors and lifts did not work for us. We dined in the restaurant one night during our stay and the food was superb.,5,2022,04,19
40,Beautiful and stylish hotel in central Barcelona,We stayed two nights at this beautiful and stylish hotel in the centre of Barcelona. The room was fabulous. The quality of everything in the room was exceptional. The room looked into the lovely indoor terrace and garden. So quiet considering the location. We dined one evening and the food and service was just perfect. I had a massage by Rossi (hope this is the correct spelling?) which was the best massage I’ve ever had . She is amazing. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2022,04,16

Very nice breakfast with lots of cooked dishes to choose from.",5,2022,04,11
40,Excellent Hotel,"Just had 4-night stay, couple with a toddler; room was all set up on arrival, as requested, for the baby.

Stayed in Executive Suite, really well thought-out bedroom, spacious, classy - but the bed itself was the highlight, incredibly comfortable.

Breakfast is very good: quality cooking and really attentive and friendly service every morning, staff went above and beyond. 

The dining room, bar, lobby and garden are all very stylish (dark, moody, trendy), a proper “architect’s hotel”.

Only had a couple of drinks, but cocktails were excellent (if a bit pricey).

Location is good, classy neighbourhood, easy walk to many attractions. Very quiet to rear, and street not very busy or loud at night (suites are to the front), no noise disturbance. 

Overall, a very impressive hotel, and would certainly stay again if back in Barcelona.",5,2022,04,05

40,Exceptional Service,"Very nice hotel, with a wonderful garden area for food/drinks. The exceptional part of this hotel is the impeccable service from every staff member. No matter the peculiarity of the request, the staff went out of its way to support, delivering on every ask with a small and absolute follow up. Despite having a fair bit of rooms and a large staff, it seemed like every staff member recalled my name and preferences.",5,2022,03,03
40,Great Hotel and Great Location,Loved the hotel . Room was great ! The hotel is Across the street from the Louis Vuitton store and other designer stores. The hotel is also walking distance to La Sagrada Familia cathedral and the Gaudi House.,5,2022,02,28
40,"Best 5-star experience, ever!","I cannot say enough about how wonderful our stay is. I went on a girls trip with my bestie, and we decided to pamper ourselves by going all out, so you can imagine our expectation is quite high. Hotel Alma exceed our expectation in every aspect. The friendly staff are so personal and approachable. The level off attention-to-detail. The quality of the interior, room, and services. The food!!! Definetely don't miss out the extensive breakfast and if time allows, do a dinner there too. We loved our stay. It was perfect.",5,2022,02,15
40,Made our stay perfect,We stayed for Valentines and the hotel was such a good frame for our special time. I think we might have fallen a little extra in love that weekend at Alma. Service was impeccable. We loved it down to every single detail. We will be back and I recommend it to everyone I care about.,5,2022,02,15
40,Fantastic service,Visited Alma Barcelona second time this year. I had to change my reservation multiple times due to COVID and got very friendly service - the staff understood my reasons well. Visit was great and we really enjoyed the place. Highly recommended. nice location but still very quiet.,5,2022,02,12
40,a quite spot in a busy area,"Very Calm hotel. Super friendly staff, perfect location and delicious breakfast.

The staff will also run the extra mile for you, contacting your airline or buying you a necessary item when you are running out of time.

Highly recommend for couples, solos or business travelers.",5,2022,01,17
40,Perfect stay,"I could write an entire book about how much we enjoyed our stay here. From the moment you step into the hotel you know you are somewhere special. We were warmly greeted by the very friendly and courteous staff who provided us with a drink as we checked in then personally showedus to to our room, carrying our bags for us. The entire building is very tastefully decorated and gives the feeling of an oasis of calm. The room was very spacious and well appointed with the largest, most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The bath room was again spacious with a separate bath, shower and two sinks. There was a well stocked mini-bar which was replenished often. Everything was of course immaculately clean. We had an evening meal and two breakfasts which were all exquisite, the waiters were very knowledgeable about the dishes they were serving and attentive but in no way intrusive. The spa is beautiful and a great place to unwind. We felt very well taken care of and were very sorry to leave.",5,2022,01,10
40,Our favorite hotel in Barcelona!,"Great location, amazing breakfast, spacious rooms and very friendly staff.
In my opinion the Grand Deluxe rooms are the best since they're on the garden side of the hotel where the suites are on the street side.",5,2022,01,10
40,10/10,"I could go on and on about my experience here. 10/10 start to finish. When we first arrived their concierge was extremely welcoming & friendly, not only getting us set up with everything but going the extra mile to recommend the best things to do including restaurants, and calling to make reservations for us. Next the room itself was fantastic & super comfortable. But the most memorable was my girlfriend and I ended up testing positive for COVID the day before we were supposed to leave which happened to be NYE so our plans for the night changed. We got a call from their director who helped get us at home tests, extended or stay extra days, coordinated the set menu they had for room service for the evening, and checked in ever day to ensure we had everything we needed. Service wins in any business and this hotel has it down!",5,2022,01,04
40,If you are privileged too,From the moment your car arrives at the front door. The staff is waiting for you with a smile. They make check in easy and quick. They unload all ur bags.

40,El Alma de Barcelona,"We had a lovely 3 night stay in this beautiful, stylish and comfortable hotel. I had a few extra requests due to an injury and everything was taken care of sympathetically.

The first impression when entering is wonderful in terms of absolute charm. Checking in was a breeze and then we were given a thorough explanation of facilities.

Our room with garden view was outstanding. The garden with restaurant and very well served bar is a haven of tranquillity in busy central Barcelona. Service at every was excellent. 

Beautiful decor; the owners and staff have done an outstanding job.

And the lovely garden inside will blow you away.",5,2021,08,12
40,A little paradise in the centre of Barcelona,"A boutique hotel that gives unique experience and knows how to please their customer. First the hotel is beautiful. The style is chic and cosy. Beautiful terrasse and garden. Second the people. From the concierge who encourages you to try the paella from their restaurant (and god we loved the food!) to the owner who explains to you the menu in a poetic way, opens a bottle of wine for you to try and many other great staff members (welcoming was great, waiters of the restaurant), that is quite unique in Barcelona! Third a private spa for the 2 of us (sauna, pool, steamer). Last a great bed, pillows and location of the hotel is spot on. Net net an amazing experience and we highly recommend this place. Definitely value for money.",5,2021,07,24
40,5 star experience,"The staff is amazing, the room is big considering we r in Europe, very clean, very calming colors.. location is nice close to lot of sights and shopping stores 
I booked a suite and they added a crib for my new born son.
They arranged a boat trip for us which was amazing..
They arranged all are restaurants reservations and suggested some.. 
The only thing that bothered me was the pillows i don’t know if its a Barcelona thing or something els.. the pillows are just weird. 
Other wise It was a 5 star experience",5,2021,07,21
40,Great location and wonderful service,Great and personal service. Well designed rooms with very comfortable beds. The garden is delightful and the restaurant excellent if a bit expensive. The spa in the basement is spacious and has a very good sized pool for swimming lengths and a steam room and sauna for relaxing.,5,2021,07,20
40,"Great location, amazing service and wonderful rooms!","After a couple days of searching for hotels and never ever being fully satisfied 100% of the hotels I’ve stayed at in the past in Barcelona, i went with the Alma Barcelona and loved it! As someone with a lot of allergies, I loved that there was no carpet in the rooms (why I chose it) and how clean everything was. Further, the decor was modern contemporary and simple, which I appreciate. Also, for being located where they are at, the room is dead quiet for great sleep! The service and warmth of the staff was what I noticed right away when I arrived, and restaurant was excellent. I look forward to coming back and staying here again. I highly recommend this hotel and the price was on point. ",5,2021,05,21
40,My Birthday,"Due to circumstances you all know we could not travel far in order to celebrate my birthday.
We decided to stay in Barcelona and have lunch and spend the night at Hotel Alma, a place we knew quite well.
At hotel Alma you feel at home, the staff is so sweet and the food really tasty.
They also offer you a comfortable bed and a quiet atmosphere.

40,An exquisite stay in a perfect city,"One of the most extraordinary hotels, spaces and services I've ever encountered. The Alma's elegant stone building, plus it's verdant gardens, cool and superior service -- the moment you step in, you know you're somewhere special. Rooms are spacious and cozy. Food in the garden in extraordinary. And when you're ready to leave and explore Barcelone, Las Ramblas and Passeig de Gracia are just outside the door. 
I can't wait to return. It's worth the trip. Don't skip the pool and saunas.",5,2021,02,05
40,"Even during lockdown, you will not find a better place to relax and chill out!","Great room, amazing smiling service, the tastiest coffee and lovely food and wine in the Restaurant. 

Not to mention the 2 hour Voyage of the Alma massage which was off the charts.

I wish I go there every week.",5,2021,02,04
40,Excellent,"The reception is really friendly and personal, taking time to explain things. The restaurant is wonderful - from the moment you are greeted to the moment when you leave. The garden is quiet - so strange in the middle of Barcelona - and the interior dining room has lots of light from the large windows. The food is delicious, with fresh ingredients, many from their own farms, cooked very well to bring out all the taste with personal touches from the chef to make for very high quality dining. We have returned and every time it is a delight.",5,2020,11,27
40,Not to be missed !! ,"If you are visiting Barcelona you must visit the alma hotel just for the restaurant ! The food is presented with such style , taste  what can I say more !!! The staff are wonderfull very on the ball !! We had a tasting menu and every portion was to die for , and as for the wine need I say more !! Forget about the price , if you want a great night out , great food , great service , just go to the alma , the chef is French , ola la ",5,2020,09,20

An unforgettable stay thanks to all the Alma’s team!",5,2020,09,13
40,Birthday Treat,"Loved everything that the hotel offered except that the pool was not open due to Covid, even though other hotel pools were open. The service I received from the hotel staff (Oscar and his colleague) was impeccable and very personalized (5 stars for service - even in the garden at the back). I even received a birthday cupcake with a candle from room service in my room on my birthday. I will return again for sure, but most likely when the pool reopens!",4,2020,07,08

despite the ongoing crisis, the service was perfect while security maximized. 
it was my first time in this hotel, but i like the atmosphere and the rooms. i will certainly back",5,2020,07,03
40,The worst receptionist of a 5 star hotel,I never had a bad experience like that. The most arrogant receptionist that I meet in my life. The name is Maria. She is very arrogant and don t consider that customer necessity and also is always upset.,1,2020,06,27
40,Twice in the same month a break of absolute relaxation at the Alma Hotel,"Cozy and comfortable hotel with professional but at the same time friendly staff. Our room, Grand Deluxe with garden-view, was spacious and quiet.

Special thanks to Leyre (sales manager) and Elisabeth (at the reception) for their exquisite hospitality",5,2020,06,18
40,5 star gem in Barcelona,"Despite the covid situation, I managed to spend a lovely night in this great gem of a hotel.  Perfectly central location, near all the shopping without being overrun.  i wish I had more time to experience their michelin fine dining, but breakfast in the garden was a real treat.    Great place to start your day or to decompress from a long day.  The rooms were small but impeccable.  The darkout shutters made for excellent sleep with no noise or sound penetrating.   The only draw back was the lack of international programming on the TV.  It's quite possible i wasn't using the system to it's capacity as i gave up quickly...but your in Barcelona.  Maybe less time in the room is a good thing.",5,2020,06,01
40,Barcelona Shutdown,"We arrived in Barcelona on a cruise ship at the start of the virus shutdown of the city. We had planned this trip a year in advance. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed. During check in, we were told that all the activities we had planned for the day were closed due to the virus. My wife and I enjoyed other activities that were still open. The next day everything was shut down and we discovered we were the only guests in the hotel. The staff bent over backwards to make sure our stay was still a memorable one. The manager Elizabeth talked to us and offered all aspects of the hotel to us. She set us up in their private courtyard and personally ensured our needs were taken care off. We are planning on returning to Barcelona to enjoy the activities we missed out on. The Alma will be the hotel we will stay in. This was our second stay at the Alma and we loved it!",5,2020,04,04
40,Beautiful Property and Great Location!,"Our family took a two bedroom suite, and the rooms were extremely spacious, lots of privacy! The breakfast in this hotel was one of the best we had as well (: Hotel is also walking distance to all the major shops and attractions in Barcelona.",5,2020,02,28
40,Fantastic modern hotel in central Barcelona,We had three days city break in Feb 2020 and would highly recommend this hotel. Modern and cool venue in a great location. Bedroom was spacious with great shower and incredibly quiet given where it is. Gym and pool both excellent and during the day there were no other guests using it. Garden was lovely for light lunch and a drink and the bar and restaurant was good but we tended to eat out and take advantage of the many lovely Tapas bars and small eating places nearby.,5,2020,02,24
40,Warm and personal service.,"The hotel is in a great location, and the rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. We were made to feel like very special guests. There are no negatives. This was the perfect hotel for us.",5,2020,02,23
40,A fabulous hotel,"This was my second stay at the Alma, and I am so glad i chose to stay here for my second visit to Barcelona. The location is central, the staff is amazing, the beds are heavenly, and the hotel itself is just gorgeous. The garden is lovely, and a great place to have a tea or some wine. I will always choose this hotel when visiting Barcelona. Thank you for another wonderful stay!",5,2020,02,22
40,Outstanding service ,"This fully deserves a 5 rating. Great location. Very stylish. Quiet and reserved. Excellent service. An all round winner. Maybe they should put a coffee machine in all rooms? It’s a minor criticism. I will return for sure.
",5,2020,02,20
40,Lovvvvvvvve This Hotel,"I love boutique hotels!   I think service and approach to patrons are more personal.  This hotel is one of them!

Great location, literally a stone’s throw to high end stores.   But I didn’t pick it for that, it’s because usually a much safer location and centrally located to iconic landmarks in the city.  Did I mention shopping????? Lol

Very clean hotel, spacious enough and the staff, an absolutely delight to deal with.   Very friendly and helpful yet very professional!

Can’t wait to go back!   Hopefully when Sagrada familia finally gets completed! ",5,2020,02,19
40,The Best,"Awesome beautiful hotel, spacious rooms, excellent amenities, very helpful and friendly staff, perfect service and an unbelievably good breakfast. It was a highlight of our trip to Barcelona. I definitely recommend it.",5,2020,02,15
40,Just feeling Home,"Excellent and very friendly service !
Top location. It's 15 min to las Ramblas and a bit more to go to Sagrada familia. 
Amazing design. So cocooning !
Even the restaurant is Top !!!
We just spent 2 great nights",5,2020,02,04
40,Great hotel in a great neighborhood,"We had the best time in Hotel Alma Barcelona.
It is located in a great spot of Barcelona, just behind Casa Mila. Very nice rooms, the most comfortable blankets and pillows, and very very nice stuff. We highly recommend Alma hotel and most definitely will visit it again when we will return to the beautiful Barcelona.",5,2020,02,03
40,a fine time,from room to shower to bed to reception to room service: everything was lovely. the Mark and Marcos and my Dominican brother were all super helpful. the restaurant handled a crowd of conference goers dutifully and deftly.,4,2020,01,30
40,Best Service and Beautiful Hotel in Barcelona!,"EVERYONE at this hotel is welcoming and prioritizes top service.  The hotel is quiet, beautifully designed and clean.  Alma is in a great location, close to shopping and amazing restaurants.   Love it so much, I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",5,2020,01,26
40,My favorite hotel in Barcelona,"Still my favorite hotel in Barcelona with excellent service, spotless rooms and great breakfast! The styling is also great with a cool modern vibe. Also your fingerprint gets you into your room which is cool and they remember mine from visit to visit!",5,2020,01,22
40,Great location- great staff,"Alma Barcelona is a hidden gem, just 2 minutes from Passeig de Gràcia with it’s wide streets lined with top brands from around the world (think Boss, D&G, Chanel etc). That is also the closest Metro station which really is the best way to get around this beautiful city if you don’t want to walk it all.
The hotel is quietly swanky, we loved the keyless doors and lift (just need your fingerprint) and the smiles of every member of staff that you meet.
Breakfast was ample and the tasting menu in the evening recommended if you like trying different things. In warmer weather the terrace of the bar/ restaurant would be fantastic but we didn’t use it as although warmer than the UK, it is still January!
The spa is ok without being spectacular, but if you are using this as a base to explore you won’t go wrong.
Definitely recommended for a special family or couples trip!",5,2020,01,20
40,Very good staff,"Best location in Barcelona. Very well attended staff. Nice view. Bathroom amenities were also very good.  
Spacious room but a bit too dark in the night.
Would be much better if the lighting were more guest friendly.",5,2020,01,19
40,"Fantastic hotel, with a couple of caveats","I really would like to give this hotel a 5, and in so many respects it is deserved. In a modern styling, it presents as a classy minimalist hotel on entry. The lobby, bar and restaurant are gorgeous, as is the outdoor garden area (though we didnt use it much in January!). The staff are wonderfully friendly and always keen to engage in a bit of conversation as you come and go from the hotel. The room we booked was one of the more expensive ones - an Executive Suite, which was a fantastic size, with an elegant bathroom. But this is where there were a couple of issues. First, these rooms - amongst the more expensive in the hotel - front on to a busy street and there is absolutely no sound proofing. If you are a light sleeper, forget it. Also, not unlike many modern hotels, the minimalist tradition extends to the lighting - without exaggeration, we sometimes needed a flashlight to find things at night. And the way the switching works remained a mystery to us throughout our stay. Our other quibble was that at times, getting things done took time. In the end, during our 5 night stay the phone in the room never worked. And, there were some other things that we needed to ask for several times before they were attended to. I would stay there again, because it is a good hotel, but it was not without fault. The restaurant is also fantastic, which I review seperately.",4,2020,01,18
40,"Great service, food, with only one issue ","We stayed at the Alma in a family suite.  The room consisted of two adjoining bedrooms which was perfect for our family of four.  The staff couldn’t have been more friendly and hospitable.  Alma’s location is perfect for a tourist - within walking distance to Sagrada Familia, other Gaudi landmarks, La Rambla, etc.  The quality of the food - both the included breakfast and a dinner at the sit down restaurant - was excellent.  Only one complaint:  our room was very noisy due to proximity to the street.  The noise level was pronounced and amongst the worst we’ve experienced.  It’s possible that our room location was a key factor, and other rooms would be much better.  The windows are clearly not noise proof.  ",4,2019,12,29
40,This is it,"I have stayed in various boutique luxury hotels in Barcelona. Hands down, this is the best. The taste, the style, coziness and especially the people make it a not only a beautiful place to stay at, but a place where you really feel like you are in Barcelona. The breakfast is one of the best I have ever seen worldwide, not huge but outstanding quality, beautifully presented, clean and just perfect. In general food was on a top level, so was the Bar service at night. The rooms are spacious and they really do the details right, e.g. the amenities. The garden is a quiet and peaceful haven right next to the main shopping street. Whenever I return to Barcelona, I don’t need to look further. 
",5,2019,12,18
40,Best Customer Service Ever!,"This hotel, the people and their policies, saved us on our trip to Barcelona after having been pickpocketed, losing our passports and all forms of payment. Concierge, specifically, Sergi, spent hours with us, filing out a police report online, finding all the forms we needed to fill out for new passports, and getting us some cash so we could get a taxi to the U.S. Consulate. It was really so above and beyond and we were so lucky to have been staying at such a top notch place when this happened. They made us feel safe and like we were at a home away from home. Throughout our entire trip, they were all so kind and attentive. The room was beautiful, the breakfast delicious, housekeeping on top of everything! We used the pool and steam room almost nightly and it was a wonderful way to end the day. The location is within walking distance to many of Gaudi's best works including Sagrada Familia and if you like to shop, it's close to all kinds of shops and high end boutiques too. I cannot express enough, what an amazing experience they gave us.",5,2019,12,01
40,Incredible Experience,"Incredible experience, thru-and-thru.  One of our finer hotel experiences ... from warmhearted reception/check-in, to all the various details of our general stay, to our departure --- service was on point!",5,2019,11,30

Arguably one of the best hotels in Barcelona. Its terrace is like an oasis in the heart of the city. I strongly recommend this property. Thank you for making our stay so fantastic.",5,2019,11,29
40,Just - amazing ,Stayed here for two days my second visit this time with my adult daughter and her boyfriend. The staff at Alma are just amazing so kind and knowledgeable. The hotel kind of leaves you speechless and the breakfast for gods sake don’t miss it,5,2019,11,24
40,A hidden gem ,"One of my favorite hotels ! and I love that it is a bit hidden. 
I was not a fan of Barcelona until I stayed at Alma. It is because of this hotel that I now love Barcelona :) 
The service is 10 out of 10, the spa is practical and clean (could use a couple more sofa beds though, there are only 2 down there), the design overall is sleek and modern and clean, you can access everything with your finger print as your key, the bar area is very cozy (they make a great espresso martini) their patio in the warmer days is beautiful and romantic, the restaurant is amazing (deserves a michelin star) the breakfast if you’re hungry is also great. 
And my favorite part are the pillows. Hands down the best pillows I have ever slept on. 
The down side are the Q-tips.. need better Q-tips. 
I Look forward to going back! ",5,2019,11,21
40,An absolute AMAZING hotel,"Unbelievable. Really. By far the nicest hotel I've been in lately (and I've been to quite a few).Great, quiet location, minutes from the center of town. An elegant, super comfortable, super clean, spacious room, and an amazing, friendly, professional staff that attends to your every call. Real nice spa (had a great massage). We had a great time. Highly recommended.",5,2019,11,11
40,Thank you Hotel Alma ,"We stayed here as a family of four in two rooms for my daughters 18th birthday.
From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and at home. Really helpful concierge who arranged a cake for the birthday girl and recommended a restaurant and near by bar.
We enjoyed the peace, great breakfast, comfortable rooms and the pool.
The pool is small but does the job and perfect for a winter stay. 

Thank you to all the staff, you should be proud! ",5,2019,11,10
40,Hotel👍 location 👍 staff👍👍👍👍👍,Great location a few minutes walk to the underground. Super friendly staff always helpful and guided our 4 day visit outlining all the locations to visit on the map. They also booked some of the attractions and recommended some good restaurants nearby. If you are visiting take note majority of the shops are closed on Sunday.,5,2019,11,10
40,"Amazing room, service and hotel.","I travel to Barcelona a few times every year and the Alma is the best hotel i have had the pleasure of staying in. The service from the staff is top-notch. The rooms are big, modern and extremely comfortable and the location is great. I didn't have a chance to use too many of the amenities but ill be back to try them out",5,2019,11,08
40,Awesome costumer service,"My wife and I stayed at Alma Barcelona for our Europe trip! After we check out and head it to Madrid I got phone call from 
Sergi López
Front Office Assistant Manager. He mention that I left some cash in the safety box,he said no worries give me adress than we can ship it to you overnight and I can get very next day! So next morning I received the full money nothing was missing, I am not sure how many hotels can offer that high level costumer service.. hotel was clean and location is prime! You can walk pretty much anywhere in bercolana, I definitely will stay again. Huge thanks to Sergi Lopez.👍",5,2019,11,07
40,One of the best hotel experiences ever!,"I stayed at the Alma Barcelona, part of the time solo and part of the time with my 9-year old son.  From start to finish, the team made our stay absolutely incredible.  Our room was very chic with a gorgeous bathroom, the most comfortable bed ever and wonderful luxury toiletries.  The hotel was super quiet and we never once felt disrupted by outside noises or noises from other guests.  The housekeeping service was too notch and always reliable!

I took the opportunity to dine in the bar several times and thought both the food and wines by the glass were fantastic, as was the service I received from the waitstaff!

While I was wowed by every aspect of my stay, the most special part for me was the friendliness and “above and beyond” mentality of the team.  They never failed to greet me with a smile, hold doors for me, provide recommendations as needed and be much more helpful than expected.  One night my son and I got stuck on the outskirts of town and were unable to get back to the hotel via Cabify or a taxi due to the protests.  The hotel front desk was on top of it and chatting with me via WhatsApp to find a solution.  When no car services were available, Arnold from the front desk team drove 20 minutes to get us, helped by the generous loan of the front desk manager’s car.  That level of kindness and service is rarely seen and I am forever grateful to them.  Arnold, you’re a wonderful driver and excellent conversationalist!!!!
I highly recommend staying here - I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Barcelona!",5,2019,11,06
40,Amazing people! ,"We recently finished a trip, unfortunately coinciding with the Barcelona protests occurring all around the hotel. While it curtailed some of activities, it highlighted the incredible caring staff. You could tell they genuinely had our welfare and safety in mind. We really appreciated them looking after us. 

Gabriella helped us with booking two tourist locations, Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia as well as making an excellent dinner recommendation and reservation. 

We ate at the hotel restaurant a lot, given the situation outside, and it was a great experience and great food. The bar is great, and they have what look like homemade potato chips that are highly addictive. 

Our rooms were high ceiling, rain shower, double bed with individual duvets. Comfortable, modern with a great view of the interior courtyard. The rooms were really so nice, the beds comfortable, and the bathtub was a deep luxury I enjoyed a lot. They filled up our mini bar every day with water and soda which we appreciated! 

One weird thing the toilet is on its own little room off to the side. It is very weird to have to travel to the sink to wash your hands. It’s not a complaint, just a odd thing. 

I also visited their exercise room and heated pool. It was relaxing and clean. 

Breakfast was a great buffet of cheeses, pastry and meats. There was even a cheesecake. There was a small menu we ordered off of occasionally. I enjoyed the pancakes and a scrambled egg and toast. 

Overall I have to say I will recommend this hotel to anyone that plans on visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona. ",5,2019,10,30
40,Cruise,This is a wonderful hotel. Great location and marvelous service. The breakfast buffet is amazing.  Love the gardens and the high tea service. The staff was very helpful and very professional. I would love to go back to Barcelona and this would be my hotel of choice.,5,2019,10,30
40,Fantastic,"Beautiful comfortable hotel with impeccable service. Includes breakfast which was perfect and of the highest quality. 

The only negatives are that the hotel is quite dark, which makes it more difficult for those with poor vision, and the pool did not have a handrail which made it hard to use. As well, the floors around the pool were quite slippery. 

The bar served great drinks and tapas, and all of the staff were friendly and courteous. ",5,2019,10,18
40,In Barcelona you can't do better than the Hotel Alma,"The Alma exceeds all of my expectations.  The restaurant food is excellent and the location is convenient for walking to many attractions.  The room is comfortable, they provide free drinks in the mini-bar and the wifi worked very well.  All of the staff is very accommodating, friendly and personable without being pretentious.  The day we were to leave for the airport the Catalan protests were starting all over town.  Streets blocked taxis stymied, buses unable to run, etc.  The staff, knowing we were leaving for the airport called our room to inform us of the issue and that we may want to leave ASAP!  We hustled to checkout and one of the concierges, Oscar, helped us outside to try and get a taxi.  However, the streets were already blocked.  Oscar walked us all over several blocks talking to associates at other hotels and to the police officers to try and discover an area where we might get a taxi that could get to the airport.  Things were very bad and he finally suggested we may have to take the Metro which was fine by us.  He then walked us to the Metro, guided us through the ticket process and took us directly to the platform, providing precise instructions for what trains to take.  And, he took great care in being sure we knew the best way to get there safely.  We made it in plenty of time thanks to Oscar.  Regardless of the cost of the hotel and what one may expect from such an establishment, my wife and I found this above and beyond and we thank both Oscar and the Alma immensely.  There is no other hotel I would ever stay at in Barcelona, but the Alma, and I hope that I will have that opportunity some day.",5,2019,10,18
40,Lovely Visit,"The hotel was superb and the staff are especially attentive. The ultra-modern decor may not appeal to everyone, e.g., the front desk, elevator, hallways are dimly illuminated and all of that is by design. We had a complimentary minibar (not as great as it sounds) that included soft drinks and beer. What we really wanted was San Pellegrino.",5,2019,10,14
40,Great location. Spacious Room. Friendly Service,"My friend who goes to Barcelona alot recommended me this hotel.
I found it much nicer than the pictures I saw online and in the magazine.

Locaion:  Top location. Near high end shops and easy access to everywhere
Service:  Very friendly staff
Room:    Spacious, clean

Only thing I have to say is the pool. I was looking forward to swim in the indoor pool. But when I went there late night in the basement level with no one there, super low ceiling at the narrow pool and low lighting, I got too scared and left.",4,2019,10,06
40,Simply wonderful. ,"A truly wonderful hotel. A home away from home. An oasis of calm and subdued luxury just steps away from Passeig de Gracia. Large and comfortable rooms, superb and extremely attentive service, Inner courtyard perfect for taking a respite from the bustle of the city and sipping coffee or enjoying some delicious tapas. One of my favorite hotels in Europe!",5,2019,10,03
40,A calming haven in the heart of bustling Barcelona,"We enjoyed a three day stay at Hotel Alma Barcelona. Of the three hotels we stayed at during our visit to Spain, this was our favorite. It is located in the bustling, high end shopping area of the city. Two of Gaudi's residential masterpieces, Casa Batllo and The Pedrera are only a few blocks from the hotel. The historic Gothic Quarter is a 20 minute walk or short cab ride away. It is an upscale, full service hotel with all of the expected amenities and modern, but subdued decor. On checking in, we received a complimentary room upgrade. Our room was spacious with ample closet space and a large bathroom with rain shower and a deep bathtub. The king sized bed was very comfortable with well placed reading lights. An in-room safe and a small refrigerator, restocked daily with complimentary beverages, were also provided. A buffet breakfast was available in the restaurant off the lobby. The restaurant also served gourmet dinners. Drinks, snacks and lighter fare were available throughout the day. A great feature was the lovely outdoor garden area, both for dining or just relaxing on the comfortable furniture. It was an oasis away from the high energy pace of the city. The hotel also features a full service spa with pool, steam room, sauna, lockers, shower facilities and exercise room. A full range of massage and beauty treatments are available. We can't say enough about the friendly, attentive staff. From the doorman who welcomed us back after each day of exploring the city, the helpful concierge staff, restaurant personnel and housekeepers, everyone was responsive to our needs and made us feel at home. We highly recommend a stay at the Hotel Alma Barcelona.",5,2019,10,03
40,Wonderful stay!,Alma Barcelona is ideally located. It's decor is modern but warm and elegant. The staff is extremely helpful. The outdoor garden is a haven where one can have breakfast or simply relax after a long day.,5,2019,10,02
40,Highly recommended ,"Perfect location in central Barcelona in the main high-end retail area but close to the major central sights/districts. 

Modern interior. Well appointed rooms 

Wonderful courtyard dining area.

Food a bit overpriced.  Good quality cocktail list.",5,2019,09,30
40,"very cool, modern-chic hotel in an excellent location","Terrific, personalized service in a very modern-chic hotel. The location at Mallorca and Passeig de Gracia was outstanding.  Our room faced the courtyard, with a direct view of the top of Gaudi's La Pedrera.  

The bed was wonderfully comfortable. The room was simple (albeit somewhat dark), but elegant in a modern way (no art on the walls).  I wish I had taken a picture of the simple, leather desk chair -- inspired by Gaudi -- it was amazingly supportive (I have a bad back and I was able to sit for an hour without any issues).  

The fitness room was good by european standards and more than acceptable to get a basic workout in. If you want to lift weights in circuits at your hotel [you're on the wrong continent :-) ] you'll need to find an international business hotel. 

We loved having a refrigerator, stocked with bottled water, juice, Coca-Cola, and beer -- all complimentary.  The staff was eager to please and genuinely helpful. 

Any frequent traveler recognizes that hotels serve breakfast as a profit maker: while we happily paid $365/night for our room, we drew the line at paying 29 euros per person for a continental breakfast (35 euros per person for a hot breakfast).  We walked about 5 minutes each morning to have wonderful breakfasts at a variety of nearby restaurants at less than the price of a continental breakfast for 1.",5,2019,09,28
40,Hotel,"Great hotel.  Great service and great location.   Very close to old Barcelona and attractions  like sagra familia.  The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.

40,Alma Barcelona -September 2019,"I can’t say enough about this lovely hotel!  The location was absolutely perfect and the staff was so accommodating and wonderful!  The accommodations were top notch!  It was a beautiful room with an equally beautiful view!  This hotel is fabulous!  The breakfast buffet was very delicious and waitstaff was wonderful.  The service in this hotel is excellent!!
We visited in September 15-19, 2019, and the weather was gorgeous.  We had just finished a 7 day cruise from Barcelona, and had booked an additional four days in Barcelona.  
We loved it so much that we will definitely book there when we return to Barcelona.  I just can’t say enough about this wonderful hotel!  Would highly recommend. this hotel!",5,2019,09,20
40,Standards set high,"Having stayed here on a few occasions it was pleasing to see that the high standards this hotel has set have been maintained . All, and I do mean all, the staff were friendly, helpful and professional in their attitude and diligent in approach to their individual tasks and duties. Food in the restaurant very good and cooked to a high standard, which also included the breakfasts. Service superb.
Good to see that in the garden area a portion is set aside for staying guests of the hotel as this area is extremely popular and a few years back did sometimes present a problem to hotel residents.
Surely one of the best hotels in the city and we have stayed in several.",5,2019,09,18
40,Hidden Gem,Absolutely loved this hotel and would highly recommend it! From check in to check out excellent service. The rooms are well appointed and can be completely dark. WiFi works great. The breakfast buffet is a must. I experienced a medical issue and they had a Dr to the room in 30 minutes. When we come back it will most definitely be to the Alma GL! ,5,2019,09,18
40,Beyond Expectations,"Although we were only in town for one night, we are so happy we choose the Alma hotel. The staff was welcoming and extremely helpful from the moment we walked into the lobby. The rooms were beautiful and the overall design of the hotel was stunning. Can't wait to stay at this or their other property again soon!",5,2019,09,17
40,Sophisticated hotel and heartwarming staffs,"All staffs are heartwarming and kind. The atmosphere is sophisticated and comfortable. Especially, the quality of breakfast is really high. Also, the location is great. You can go to a lot of sightseeing spots on foot. I’ll definitely choose the hotel if I get a opportunity of staying Barcelona again. ",5,2019,09,16
40,"Perfect Location, Wonderful Staff, The Best Breakfast Ever","I was returning to Barcelona for a friend's wedding, and stumbled upon Alma, as the Israeli chef and author Yotam Ottolenghi posted photos of their breakfast buffet on Instagram. I was immediately intrigued, and decided to book a four-night stay. 
Not only is the hotel fantastic, in terms of design and ambience the staff really make the difference. 
The concierge went out of their way to help me - offering to store the groceries I had bought in Italy in the fridge until my departure back to Asia; helping me with directions when receiving a package; and liaising with the airline when my partner's luggage was lost. The wait staff at breakfast were delightful, as were the staff at the bar. 
And yes - the breakfast really is phenomenal.
Alma goes straight into my little book of favourite hideaways, and I look forward to returning soon!",5,2019,09,16
40,Hotel Alma Best Hotel Stay Yet,We have both traveled the world for business and pleasure. This was our favorite hotel yet as the staff were amazing and really made you feel special. You can clearly tell they like their jobs and each other and it showed from Elias at the front desk to the bar staff. I can’t speak highly enough of the staff. Rooms were beautiful and the hotel was very modern and well appointed. Cudo’s to Hotel Alma for creating such an amazing team of people loved every encounter we had with staff. Keep doing what you are doing. Thanks for a great time.,5,2019,09,15
40,amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel! Staff is incredibly lovely and helpful people, the location is perfect, the garden is beautiful! The room is excellent, great bathroom and shower! Breakfast is one of the bests I've ever had.",5,2019,09,13
40,Return visit,"The fact we returned to this hotel albeit for only one night given the choice in Barcelona says it all. The Alma continues to be an oasis just off Passeig de Gràcia with easy access to the whole of the city. The garden bar is extremely tranquil and all of the hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Great rooms whichever grade you pick with fantastic bathroom and shower. Next visit we will be back at the Alma, hopefully for a little get stay.",5,2019,09,08
40,The lap pool was simply outstanding,"An oasis of cool in a hot city.  Chill, clean, minimalist lines. Great Tapas, helpful staff, recognized needs without having to articulate them.  Thanks for the Sitges beach idea! Look out for the towering Palo borracho.",5,2019,09,05
40,Beautiful garden,"I’be been to Alma many times for drinks and once for dinner. Their garden is an oasis in the middle of Barcelona! Drinks are expensive but worth it for the ambiance, dinner was very good but also on the pricey side. ",5,2019,09,04
40,Best of Barcelona,"My husband and I booked at Alma Barcelona to accommodate us for a couple nights before a cruise and another night upon our return from said cruise. We were originally planning to book at the Hilton, but ended up looking for alternatives when the Hilton was sold out for our dates. We chose Alma based on the glowing reviews and are happy to report that it exceeded our expectations.

First, we arrived much earlier than their check in times on both arrival dates, but Alma staff never batted an eyelash over our showing up so much earlier than expected. From the moment we walked through the door exhausted from our travels, Alma staff made us feel instantly at home. The reception and doorman service was impeccable from start to finish for each of our two stays and we were happily surprised by a free upgrade upon our second stay (the original room was impressive enough, so we were grateful for a chance to see higher level rooms too at no extra cost). 

The hotel building itself is by far the best and most unique I’ve ever seen. With dim lighting and sleek modern decor, it has a very elegant vibe. Rather than use a traditional key (although one is available), we opted for fingerprint access to our room and hotel amenities, which was very convenient and more high-tech than we’ve seen in other hotels. The rooms are open-concept with beautiful, modern decor, impressive showers with rainfall shower heads. There are no doors for the showers but one for the toilet area (something to consider if traveling with someone other than a romantic partner, but I believe they do have some rooms with closed showers upon request). A complimentary minibar with water, juice, soda and beer is included and restocked daily. 

The best thing about the rooms at Alma are the beds. Those have to be the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Super soft with tons of pillows and down comforters. I have missed that bed tremendously since we left! They thought of every detail and provided disposable toothbrushes, toothpaste and yummy smelling soaps, shampoos and conditioners in every room along with large comfortable towels and robes with slippers too. Converters for the outlets are available from the reception upon request. 

The location is perfect. It’s close enough to all the touristy parts of Barcelona, so that you can easily take in all the sights by walking, subway or bus, but also close enough that if you walk a few blocks in the other direction, you can explore the more local areas too. 

There is a free gym and spa included in your stay at Alma. We loved the spa, which has a couple of saunas and a beautiful, indoor pool to cool off in afterwards. The bar, restaurant and garden area are all very nice and offer excellent service, just like the rest of the hotel. The restaurant food and bar snacks were top notch! 

I was most impressed by Alma overall with the level of service the staff provides. They certainly live up to their five star rating and in my opinion, they surpass it. Each staff member goes above and beyond to ensure that their guests have the most enjoyable experience and my husband and I truly appreciated that. We loved Barcelona as much as we did, in large part, because of Alma Hotel. 

We will most definitely be back to Barcelona and the Alma Hotel. They set the bar high for all other hotels and despite having stayed in some fancy five-star hotels in other parts of the world, none come even close to comparing to Alma. We are so grateful to have discovered such an amazing gem and are eagerly looking forward to spending a lot more time there in the future.❤️

If you are considering a stay at Alma, I highly recommend you book it asap. There simply is no better option in Barcelona (or possibly even anywhere else in the world). Enjoy your trip!",5,2019,09,02
40,Very good hotel but...,"My husband & I stayed for 2 nights after touring & cruising for almost 3 weeks. We would consider staying here again if we come back to Barcelona, but there is room for improvement.
Reservation & private transfer booking was easy & Concierge was very proactive. Great location. Exec Suite was roomy, we’ll appointed, clean & comfy, prompt housekeeping services. Great spa. Doorman was very helpful during our arrival, departure & all times in between. Check-in & out process was very quick & gracious. Always nice to be escorted to our room after check-in. Breakfast was very good, staff attentive. Our room rate included the tasting menu dinner - good but not memorable; service excellent though.
Room for improvement: 
1. We checked in at around 10:30pm after flying in from Florence. After freshening up we went to the bar to have a drink & maybe something to eat. Drinks order took about 15 minutes to serve (we were the only ones inside the bar except for 1 man who left soon after we sat down) since the staff made cleaning up glasses & dishes their 1st priority (I guess they wanted to close up & go home as soon as possible) rather than serving us drinks. We asked for the tapas menu & were told by a male server that the kitchen was closed.  No apology. If I were a well trained server I would have suggested maybe ordering off the room service menu & being served our order at the bar. We didn’t know it at that time but we later found out that room service was available round the clock. We asked for bar snacks so they gave us almonds  & potato chips.
2. During check-in we were warmly greeted & helped by a very nice young lady at the Front Desk. There was one other person at the desk. This other person never once looked at us nor greeted us the whole time we were checking in; he looked at his computer screen the whole time. We encountered the same guy the next afternoon, same thing: no greeting, no smile, no direct eye contact - like we were not even there. Not the type of person you want at a hotel reception desk.
We had stayed at the Mercer Hotel at the beginning of our trip & the great service we received there set the bar very high in terms of customer service.  ALL the Mercer staff couldn’t do enough for us & made us feel they were truly delighted to have us at their hotel. We were looking for that same feeling at Alma but did not get it. ",4,2019,08,30
40,Out of the world service! Tremendous rooms!,"As soon as you check into the Alma, you get a feeling that you are the most important guest they've received. The level of customer service, and attentiveness is out of the world. They have a policy that if they can do something for you, they will, and they make sure of it. As soon as I checked in, they gave me a complimentary upgrade, and said, if we can do something to make you happy, we will. The rooms, the garden, the quality of amenities, staff - all of the above, made it a splendid stay in Barcelona. The area in which the hotel is located, is also fantastic. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay at the Alma, and will stay here again if given the opportunity.",5,2019,08,26
40,GREAT STAY AT HOTEL ALMA,"My wife and I spent a fabulous week in Barcelona and our stay at this hotel was excellent.
Room was clean, hotel was stylish, staff was VERY friendly and helpful. Location of hotel in the city was close to major attractions as well.
Rooftop Terrace especially was quaint and inviting.

Alan N.",5,2019,08,17
40,Fantastic Stay,"My wife and I booked a cruise from Barcelona. The goal was to return to Barcelona and explore the city afterwards. With the help of testimonials, pictures and a little research we made reservations at the Alma Barcelona, sight unseen.  This proved to be a great decision!  We arrived at our hotel at 7:15am, and though this was significantly earlier than normal check in time, the staff was not only incredibly accommodating, but SUPER friendly.  While their team changed shifts, they invited us into their restaurant for complimentary coffee and tea.  After officially checking in, we were presented with plenty of information to make our stay more comfortable, including a map of the area, must-see attractions, restaurant recommendations, etc.  Our luggage was brought to our room promptly as well.
Each morning, everyone was pleasant as well as willing and able to assist with anything we needed.
While I certainly forgot most of the spanish I once knew, the staff even sent a technician to our room to change the language on the television to English.
There was even a quality control person to verify that our room was cleaned and prepared to our satisfaction.
The Alma Barcelona is in a very nice part of town, approximately 15 minute walk to Sagrada Familia, and around the corner from luxury shopping.
The property is quite modern, and has all of the amenities you'd expect.  The bed was very comfortable as well.
I would highly recommend a visit to the Alma Barcelona. We will certainly be back!",5,2019,08,14
40,"Great Location, 5 Star Service","We stayed at the Alma for 4 nights in July on our first trip to Barcelona.  The location was excellent, a half block away from Passeig de Gracia yet very quiet in the evening.  The service was outstanding.  When we checked in I felt like I had a personal consultant who provided a wealth of information on the city along with their recommendations which were very helpful.  The night we arrived we were tired from traveling all day but wanted to get some dinner nearby.  The restaurant that was recommended was outstanding and a 2 block walk.  Would definitely return on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,08,10
40,Short trip do Barcelona,"Amazing, big, clean and nive view in the room, wonderful restaurant between trees and whole staff. It was only one day but we are very happy. I recommend this hotel, in the centre of Barcelona, near to Casa Milo and Casa Battlo.",5,2019,08,10
40,Review,"This was a lovely hotel. Where do I start. Our deluxe room was impressively large, clean and modern. I loved the large shower and the modern bathroom. Free daily mini bar and twice a day room service. The bed was so comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is central to everything. We would definitely come back here again. Breakfast was lovely, however my son would have liked to eat a full english breakfast too,which is not available. He did however enjoy the hot breakfast items very much.I'm also a vegetarian and enjoyed the breakfast,however felt very limited to what I could eat, as there was not much available.",5,2019,08,10

Will be back next time we are in Barcelona :)",5,2019,07,24
40,A wonderful treasure,My husband and I just adored this gem of a hotel. What a lovely surprise to have a bottle of champagne on ice delivered to our door after mentioning we were celebrating our anniversary. As extraordinary as the service was at Alma I must say the best part was a gentleman that works there named Marcos. He was so wonderful and made us feel at home in a new city and culture. He helped make what could have been a disappointing trip (airlines lost our luggage!) a fantastic experience. Thank you Marcos and Hotel Alma!,5,2019,07,19
40,Alma Barcelona is Amazing,Great location!!!  Great staff and beautiful rooms.  Boutique hotel that hits all of the notes.  Staff are very knowledgeable and willing to help.  Beautiful gardens to have a drink or eat a meal.  Everything is within walking distance from hotel.,5,2019,07,08
40,Wonderful Experience!,"My husband and I had a wonderful 3 days at Alma.  The terrific experience started with check in...the staff could not have been nicer and so helpful with helping us map out the sights we wanted to see in 3 days.  They recommended restaurants for tapas as well as casual eating.  All great!  
The room was clean, large and comfortable.
AND my favorite part, the breakfast every morning was so delicious.  We had one dinner in the bar one night and",5,2019,07,08
40,EXOTIC ALMA,"Very friendly staff and an amazing location with a great atmosphere.  Only downside is the size of the swimming pool - Located in the basement and quite small.
Located just 10 minutes from the Rambler and easy access to the Metro train system.",5,2019,07,08
40,Pure Excellence. An Oasis in the City.,"We are 4 friends celebrating “milestone” birthdays this year, and we spent 6 nights in Barcelona’s Hotel Alma. There cannot be a better hotel than Alma in the summer. The rooms are quite large for Europe (we were in the “deluxe” rooms. 2 persons per room.) Temperature in the room was perfect despite a very hot week in Barcelona. Our rooms opened to the back terrace, and when we chose to open the large window/door, we were greeted with either the birds singing, or soft music emanating from the terrace, depending on the time of day. Beds, bedding and pillows are extremely comfortable here. Bathroom and shower is a clever design: open concept to shower and sink area, gives enough space for 2 sinks, a large shower, and even a bath! Separate room for toilet. The mini fridge was filled daily with small water bottles, juice, beer and coke. All free! This convenience was wonderful. Each staff person was kind and helpful. When we arrived from an overnight flight, we were offered drinks to refresh us (hint: sample the orange juice). Even though it was morning, they were able to get us into a room quickly so we could freshen up and start exploring the city. The staff hailed taxis for us regularly, made restaurant reservations, and did research for us on possible tours outside of the city. There was always someone to welcome us to the hotel, or wish us a good day as we departed. And the back terrace area.... we used this at least once per day. The terrace is a quiet oasis. Deceptively large, there are couches and chairs scattered throughout. We had wine/beer/cava/sangria/gin & tonic, here every evening before heading out to dinner. The waitstaff here were absolutely lovely. Exceptionally professional yet fun and personable. Finally, I should mention the location which we found to be perfect! Just off Passeig de Gracia in Eixample yet somehow very quiet. Only one block from La Pedrera! (We literally booked our tickets on our phone from the room and showed up 15 minutes later for direct entry into La Pedrera!) 10-15 minute walk to the Passeig de Gracia metro and train station - where the yellow line takes you up to Alfons X station for the Park Guell bus, or the train line takes you to Sitges for a beach day!  Walking distance to Sagrada Familia. While this is a high-end area, you will still be less than a 10 minute walk from a number of really good, reasonably priced restaurants that aren’t just for tourists. Being near the Rambla de Catalunya was very nice. Truly we feel that we chose the perfect hotel in Barcelona, for comfort, style, wonderful staff, and location. ",5,2019,07,07
40,100% would stay here again,"I love this hotel. I did quite a bit of research before selecting this as my hotel and the stellar reviews they have are all true! I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The staff is friendly and helpful, always greeting you with a smile. The check in was fantastic and they even offered a welcome beverage. My room was ready upon arrival (and after an 8 hour flight this made a huge difference). The location is so central and walkable to Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, Sagrada Familia and the Barri Gotic. The breakfast is PHENOMENAL. Omg guys, this alone is a reason to stay here. Vera, our hostess was so lovely and remembered our coffee preferences and would have them ready every day when we arrived. The only thing I'd caution is that the bathroom has an open concept - this was not an issue for us, but if you are traveling with friends, you should call the hotel and inquire if they have alternative rooms that offer more privacy (I believe they do). The other feedback I'd offer is that they have the cutest items in display cases for various shops in town, they should allow hotel guests to be able to purchase them on site. There was a ring I really loved but I had to walk all the way to the shop to inquire about it.",5,2019,07,04
40,Great service and awesome garden,"We stayed for 4 nights. Staff is very cordial and attentive, especially Marcos. Cappuccino and food at the restaurant is excellent. 

However, room service needs more selections and food and beverages need to be delivered covered. Executive suite is very spacious with a large bathroom. Hotel and room were very clean. Didn't not like the dark blue color of our room.

Overall, happy with the our stay. Would highly recommend the Alma Barcelona Hotel. ",5,2019,07,02
40,Our fantastic stay at the Alma,"What a haven of peace in a vibrant city. The customer service was 5 star and all the team at the Alma were very genuinely interested in you having a great time.
The food was amazing and the garden area totally relaxing.
Everything was superb and we will return for sure :)",5,2019,07,01
40,Vacation,"We stayed at the alma hotel for 5 nights. It is in a wonderful location, the staff were great especially Isaac at breakfast. All the concierge staff were very helpful and friendly with directions, especially Marcos. It is a quite location and steps away from my favorite Paseo de gracias where you can shop till you drop or walk to the ramblas and other parts of Barcelona. 
 They do have a stocked minibar( no liquor) which was great . All we needed was water and soft drinks. 
It is indeed quite here after a long day at the beautiful bustling city of Barcelona. 

My only gripe was I was told my room overlooked the garden at check in but when I went up to my room it didn't.
Also my 11 course meal which was included in my package on booking suddenly changed to 6 course on the night of the dinner without notice. 

All in all, it was a pleasant experience staying at alma Barcelona.",4,2019,06,29
40,Outstanding service and location in Barcelona,"We recently visited Barcelona with x6 other couples (old friends) who traveled from all over the world to get there - a mini reunion of friends from our childhood days north of Boston. Our friends stayed 4 nights each, but my husband and I stayed for a week in total. I have to say, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves staying at the Alma Barcelona. It was awesome just to walk outside the hotel entrance and be right in the middle of the city itself and all the marvelous sights. The staff at the hotel were exceptional in terms of their attentive customer service. The front desk and concierge teams in particular bent over backwards to help with with anything we wanted - and always with a big smile on their faces. Our room faced the courtyard in the back of the hotel which was attractive, although a bit noisy. The room itself was very spacious (albiet additional lighting was needed as a bit dark) and the bathroom's walk-in shower wonderful (not to mention the amenities). We loved using the finger print entry into the room instead of carrying a key all the time. It made life so easy. Thank you to all at the hotel for making our holiday and reunion in your lovely city so memorable!",5,2019,06,29
40,Everything you can ask for!,"Great place, outstanding service, very convenient location: on a quiet street but next to Paseig de Gràcia and few steps from underground.. the garden at the back is a paradise with great service but quite steep prices..",5,2019,06,26
40,A fantastic 5 star hotel with excellent service,"Alam Barcelona is perfectly located in the Example district surrounded by amazing restaurants (see my other reviews) and within a 15-20 minute walk to Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas. The service is very attentive and professional. Welcome drink provided. The executive suite was outstanding, spacious, with high class bedding and toiletries (Bulgari). The bathroom and shower was top notch. We really liked the fingerprint access to the room which definitely beats using a card or key. We did not get breakfast at the hotel as it was over 30 euros per person. Lots of places nearby for breakfast so that was not an issue. This hotel also has a really nice large courtyard which looks like a small park with lots of trees and plants, a really nice place to have a drink. We have stayed in 5 star hotels before that in our opinion are just glorified 4 star establishments. Alma Barcelona is a true 5 star experience. Would definitely return. Overall grade: A.",5,2019,06,20
40,A stylish experience in the center of town,"A stylish and smart hotel with exceptionally  well equipped large rooms. Excellent location, yet quiet!
Charming restaurant and tapas bar in a nice garden with large trees, cool in summer. Excellent breakfast! ",5,2019,06,19
40,Drinks in the bar... Finally a good drink,We had a recomendation to stop at the bar at the Alma Hotel to have a cocktail. Finally someone knew how to make a good drink  Martin made a dirty martini and another concoction of his choice that was amazing. Next time we come back to Barcelona we will stop back in for a drink! ,5,2019,06,18
40,A lovely discreet 5-star hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in every way, from its discreet presence on Carrer de Mallorca, just off the Passeig de Gracia, to the contemporary styling of the public rooms and of the bedrooms, with timber as its main theme. The staff were unfailingly helpful, and the welcome we got from Vera for breakfast in the morning brightened up our day. The garden is a green oasis in the middle of a classic 19th century Barcelona block.",5,2019,06,18
40,A great gem in the heart of Barcelona,"From the moment you step into the Alma hotel, you know the service is going to top notch. Everyone from the front desk to cleaners were absolutely amazing. Looking forward to staying there again in the future. ",5,2019,06,17
40,Outstanding European Hotel,"The Alma Barcelona Hotel is a beautiful hotel with amazing contemporary rooms. The hotel restaurant provides excellent food and service on a beautiful outdoor terrace. 
Reception at the hotel is excellent: both courteous and convenient. The concierge can arrange everything from tickets to La Sagrada Familia to taxis and restaurant recommendations. Actually, I found the hotel's own restaurant to be better than anything else I had while in Barcelona. The location is excellent and the staff is fluent in English and other languages as well. I felt at home while staying at this hotel. I have stayed in many cities in Europe, but this hotel is one of the best.",5,2019,06,17
40,Our new favorite hotel in Barcelona.,"We had a perfect stay at the Alma Barcelona.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful.  The decor is a dream - chic and minimalist, but still cozy.  We had great massages at the spa, a fabulous meal on the patio, and the beds are so comfortable.  Central location to shopping and restaurants, while still walkable to all of the sites you would want to see.  It is our new home base in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,16
40,Mrs Tian,"The stuff was very helpful and fluent in English. The service and location is excellent and convenient to restaurants, shoppings and sightseeing. I have to say I really enjoyed staying at Alma and will go back next time in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,09

40,Great Hotel,"Had a 3 night stay here. We were upgraded on arrival to a suite. Free mini bar with soft drinks and water which was lovely. The gardens were nice with scattered seating and a lovely place to have a drink. Very convenient position in centre, so walking distance to most attractions. The staff here are amazing and really try to make your stay enjoyable and nothing is too much trouble. We would definitely stay again next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,07
40,Great location,Location is perfect for walking through Barcelona; staff was really helpful in getting reservations at hard-to-get-into restaurants as well as offering excellent advice about other things to do in the city,5,2019,06,04
40,Amazing stay!,"Fantastic hotel.  Went there with my son, to watch Barcelona versus Liverpool in the Champions League (May 1st) and stayed for one night.  Staff is amazing (always goes the extra mile), rooms are huge and very confortable, and the hotel is in a great location.  Rooms have your fingerprints as room cards.  Food was also delicious.  Will of course be back.",5,2019,06,04
40,"One-Of-A-Kind, Chic, Classy but Homely","My hubby and I stayed at Alma Barcelona for two nights. We felt like living in a fancy, classy apartment with a high-caliber team of kind and handsome staff. The location is the very center of Eixample. We enjoyed some of the good restaurants within a few blocks away. It has a beautiful courtyard. When we opened the floor-to-ceiling windows, we could heard some exotic sounds of birds and have some fresh air. We did enjoy staying in our room with the exceptional modern interior. I liked the spa area a lot too. It has a serene atmosphere with an onsen-water pool and a nice dry sauna. We would definitely come back for a next visit to Barcelona.",5,2019,06,03
40,Wonderful Stay!,"We stayed at the Alma, pre and post cruise out of Barcelona port. From the moment our taxi arrived at the curb,the staff was  ready to move our luggage, offer us a place to sit while checking in, offering water and explaining the hotel. The room was large, clean, modern and offered a view of one one of Gaudi’s buildings, La Pedrera. The bed was outstanding, a mini bar was stocked with water, beer, soda and juice (all included with the room rate). The rooms are minimalist/modern and provide a calm retreat in such a busy city. The Sagrada Familia is a short 15 minute walk and there are numerous coffee shops, bodegas and restaurants, along with high end shopping within 1-2 blocks of the hotel in a very safe, pedestrian friendly part of town.

The best part of the stay was the staff. Any request, issue, recommendation or accommodation they could provide was done so without complaint in quick, polite and efficient manner. Every staff member we had contact with was over the top when it came to customer service and no matter what their function was equal and consistent throughout our stay.

We would not stay in any other hotel in Barcelona. This retreat, with the gardens, bar, restaurant and facility is by far one of the best in the world that we have stayed. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a wonderful getaway or base while in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,02
40,Ellen Pagan,What a beautiful hotel! We arrived on a Monday and got upgraded to an executive suite. The accommodations were exceptional. The staff was superb! The gardens were a beautiful place to relax but thought the menu was quite steep.,5,2019,05,25
40,Outstanding,"This is a outstanding hotel with a wonderful staff and ideally situated in barcelona center, walking  distance lot of shops and restaurants  Rooms are large, beautiful, new  and modern , the bed was very comfortable. I hope highly recommend it.",5,2019,05,24
40,"Excellent location, amazing staff","My husband and I stayed at Alma Hotel for 6 nights in May. We arrived and was immediately greeted by one of the staff members who helped us with our bags and offered us welcome drinks. Check-in was so seamless! We were even give a free upgrade to the Grand Deluxe corner room. 

I loved the location of the hotel. Right in the middle Eixample’s luxury shopping district. Close to attractions like La Pedrera and Casa Batllo. Everything is pretty much in walking distance. Metro station and taxis are all within reach. 

We really appreciated how all staff were so incredibly friendly and welcoming. Even though we were on vacation, the staff made us feel like home. If we go back to Barcelona we would absolutely choose to stay at Alma. ",5,2019,05,23
40,Brilliant,"Fantastic location in the heart of Barcelona. Modern, immaculately clean, comfortable no nonsense, Absolutely top service. Good food, especially enjoyed breakfast. Every aspect of the hotel and service is organised to make one's stay smooth and easy. Garden is a bonus. Highly recommend.",5,2019,05,22
40,Good place,Lovely food and a wonderful area to stay in with friendly staff a great way to start a trip overseas. The best of the European hotels we have ever stayed in. A really credit to Spain and the city it is in,4,2019,05,22
40,A quiet oasis in the center of the city,"Located just off Passeig de Gracia and one block from the Pedrera is this lovely hotel with fabulous service in a great location.  The hotel is nicely and comfortably furnished with very efficient task lighting and a foyer brining in natural light.  The rooms are very comfortable and secure with fingerprint readers to access the guest rooms.  The room had a very comfortable bed and pillows, a quiet air handling system and a room that was dark at night.  The service throughout our stay was excellent, from the moment we checked in until we left in a taxi for our boat.  Arriving later than expected due a delayed flight over the pond and a missed connection, we opted for tapas in the lounge after we checked in.  The tapas were terrific and the lounge had a good wine selection.  They also offer a very good and attractive restaurant for breakfast and dinner.  In addition to the wonderful staff of people that make the place work, perhaps the best feature is the large outdoor wooded areas in a plaza off the dining room and lounge.  It is a very relaxing oasis in the city.",5,2019,05,22
40,Fabulous service oriented hotel.,"Simply put, the staff is there for you the moment your car/taxi pulls up.  They sat us down and took care of reservations for key sites and were always there for us.  The hotel has a well trained staff like top 5 star hotels but a much more intimate size.  The rooftop views are amazing although not open until June for access.",5,2019,05,20
40,Fantastic!!!,"We loved our stay!! The staff was very kind and helpful👍we would only go to this top hotel in Bsrcelona. The quality of the breakfast is exceptional and the garden is very lovely. The location is also perfect. 
Marc and Adriana from Zürich",5,2019,05,20
40,Hidden jewel in Barcelona,"Highly recommend this wonderful hotel.  The staff is outstanding - very friendly and accommodating. Everyone speaks very good English, in case your Spanish is not good,  and they go the extra mile to ensure you have a great guest experience.  Rooms are well-appointed, modern, spacious and clean; love, love, love the huge walk-in shower.  Water pressure was good. 

Both the bar and restaurant have good food and service. We ate breakfast every morning in the restaurant.  Breakfast consisted of a large buffet of fresh fruits, juices, pastries, cheeses and breads along with cooked to order items, such as omelettes and pancakes, available to order from the menu.  Lattes and cappuccinos were very good. We also ate one dinner in the restaurant, again, great experience.  The bar has a nice wine selection and delicious tapas.  We recommend the fried artichokes and Iberian ham.  In nice weather, you can also eat in the pleasant garden.  

The hotel is located on a side street around the corner from the Passeig de Grácia, a busy street with a multitude of shops and restaurants and close to several metro stations.  None of the street noise permeates into the rooms, however.  

Overall, this is one of the best hotel experiences I’ve had.  Will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,05,14
40,Great boutique hotel!,"I stayed with my husband and child in the grand deluxe room for 4 nights. We were very satisfied with this hotel. The room was spacious, the bed very comfortable, enough closet space, nice amenities in the bathroom and a complimentary mini bar with water,beer, soda and juices. They provide a nightly turn down service. Our room overlooked a nice garden area where you can have some drinks before dinner. We didn’t eat in the restaurant so we can’t comment on that. The shower had good water pressure, they have a separate bathtub and toilet area. The only minor comment we had was that there was no door to the bath area so it can get a bit cold when you get out of the shower. There’s also a sauna available and small indoor pool but we didn’t get to use it during our time.

The location is excellent as it is right off the Passeig de Gràcia where there are plenty of shops,cafes, and restos. It is walking distance to the Casa mila, Casa batllo, And to the bus stop where la roca express picks up and drops off. There is also a 24 hr supermercado nearby. It is easy to get on the metro from here and taxis as well.

The staff are all helpful and pleasant.they attend to your needs and concerns immediately. I emailed them something to print at night and it was brought up within minutes. They also sent me a cake for my birthday. We are very happy with the service and would recommend this homey hotel with 5 star service!",5,2019,05,12

40,Amazing Boutique Hotel,"Everything about our stay was top notch! The employees at the hotel are simply amazing, the beds SO comfortable, the room was very clean, the location is perfect - I would return to the Alma over and over.",5,2019,05,06
40,Boutique hotel with great staff,"I stayed there for 5 nights with friends. It is a stylish and chic hotel located in a perfect neighborhood. It takes a few minutes to walk to La Pedrera, Casa Battlo as well as luxury shops and metro station. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. The staff is very kind, attentive and friendly - special thanks to Gabriela, Adrian and Oscar for all your help!

The only thing that we think needs to be improved is the bathroom - there is no shower curtain or doors in the bathroom to prevent water from falling all over the floor.

Other than that, we think it is perfect and will come again for the next visit and would highly recommend to our friends.",5,2019,05,04
40,Very nice hotel in a great quiet location.,"The only thing that could use some improvement is the bar/wait staff.  The service could be improved.  Took a while to be served and asked for something in room and never received from bar.  The breakfast spread was excellent and our room was spacious, quiet, with a very large shower.",4,2019,05,04
40,Alma is amazing,"I have stayed at many nice hotels all over the world and the Alma in Barcelona was one of my best experiences! The staff is friendly and hospitable, the room was spacious and very modern. The bed was so comfortable with clean fresh linens and a wide variety of pillows (which was my favorite part!!! I love pillows!!!). Every night the turn down service came with little chocolates. The hotel even gave me a rose for saint Jordi day which was a super cute touch. I was happy to have the Alma to go back to every night and would 100% stay here again when visiting Barcelona. Also hotel is located perfect distance from all the sights and in a super safe neighborhood.",5,2019,04,27

One of the best hotel breakfast we have ever had.

And also worked great with kids.

40,True 5 Star Experience,"In addition to the outstanding quality of our hotel room ( most comfortable bed) and hotel facilities, it is the always pleasant, warm, genuine attitude of the staff that my wife and I will remember.

40,Perfect Hotel in Barcelona,"What a gem!  Small and discreet but once you walk in, discover beautiful living room leading to a lovely dining area. Had lunch in the garden one afternoon and it was perfect - birds chirping, but you can’t hear the busy Passeig de Garcia traffic just outside. But once you step out of hotel, it’s shopping street, next door to La Pedrera, a few streets to Casa Battlo. The highlight to mention - the service from every staff. Take a swimsuit to use the spa pool. One note - our room did not have a separate room for the shower. It was shielded by a screen. No issues - just to keep in mind on who you are traveling with. I can’t wait to return!",5,2019,04,14
40,"Well-designed Hotel, attentive staff","Central hotel at Passeig de Gracia. Rooms are nice, solid and well thought-through. In my case the Grand Deluxe is spacious (room and bathroom), lots of space to store stuff. Corridor in room & extra door / shutter shuts of potential noise from hotel corridor. Windows likewise have own interior wooden shutters. So everything is arranged for a quiet sleep. 
Nice bar with good food in the evenings as well as good breakfast offer (extensive, high quality buffet plus small range of cooked-to-order items).

Definitely will come back again!",5,2019,04,10
40,"Fabulous Room, Location, Staff and Dining","Spent four nights at the ALMA, and couldn't say enough positives!

Bring your swimsuit: the spa is sweet.",5,2019,04,09
40,Perfect place to stay,"This hotel was recommended by our travel agent and I can see why. Right from reception at the outset there wasn’t anything they couldn’t do for us.

40,A nice hotel with a garden view and easy acsess to Passeig de Gràcia,"It is a value hotel overviewing a garden with easy acsess to Passeig de Gràcia. Staff are very friendly in a Spanish way. In particular, door men and women are so nice. One thing I have to point out is a very bad internet connectivity, which I got so stressed.",5,2019,03,30
40,Style but no substance,"The reception and bar area are gorgeous and the hotel certainly does have great style. However, there are some really frustratingly bad things at this hotel which are not acceptable given it's 5* rating.

Namely: 

THE SPA - The pool was filthily, it was full of horrid floating decay in the pool. Upon closer examination the walls of the pool were unclean appeared to be some sort of limescale. Secondly, the pool is so shallow you cannot do proper lengths as your arms and hands hit the bottom as you swim. Not fit for purpose. The steam room was so bad, barely any steam - again not fit for purpose. Sauna was good. Gym - if you call it that, was very minimal and unimpressive - no free weights, few treadmills/cross trainers.

THE BAR: 
Terrible service, I mean, once we were waiting almost 30 minutes for a beer for crying out loud! I looked over at the barman was doing a promo video. Mildly improved next few nights, but on average, drinks can take 20 minutes. Bar area and garden are good however. 

ROOMS:
The air conditioning is not good, kept waking up in sweats throughout the night. You can’t seem to pre-set a specific temperature, you have to increase and decrease by 3 degrees. 
The lights switches – my god, you need to be a commercial pilot to work out the switches, there are about 10 and they all do something different. I just wanted to charge my phone by my bed but if you turn the lights off, the plug turns off too. After all of this, the rooms are so dark! 
The toilet was positioned next to the door, so your legs constantly whack the door as it swings open and closed. It’s like they didn’t think anything through. Free minibar is a nice touch though and the rooms are smart. 

BREAKFAST:
Was lovely and so were the staff. To be fair, all the staff in this hotel are lovely. 

To quote Forest Gump 'that's all i gotta say about that'.",3,2019,03,26
40,Excellent dinner and cocktails,"We were visiting Barcelona on holiday and went for a meal with my cousin Stuart who lives here.
We had cocktails in the lovely garden at the rear of the hotel. My Moscow mule was very well made.
We had dinner in the restaurant and the service, food and wine were excellent. I had the Catalan peas followed by duck liver. It was well balanced and the duck liver was tender and cooked perfectly. We had some tomato bread to accompany the meal and this, again, was of very good quality and crispy. We drank a white Rioja - this was crisp and they have a good cellar
We finished with coffees which were accompanied with some delicious chocolate.
Highly recommended and a good choice by Stuart ",5,2019,03,25
40,Alma Barcelona -- The Best,"We have recently returned from a 3 week holiday in Spain which ended with a 4 night stay at the Alma Barcelona, our second stay there.

We absolutely loved staying at the Alma.  

First and foremost, the staff made us so very welcome.  We were delighted to see Marcos there once again to greet us, make sure our bags were taken up to our room and to offer us advice and assistance whenever we needed it. ¡Gracias!

Gabriela welcomed us at check-in with an offer of a glass of cava (although all we needed was some sparkling water), a welcome room upgrade and helpfully provided some advice to the beautiful city of Barcelona.  ¡Gracias!

Arnau graciously guided us to a spot from which we were able to see the Sagrada Familia in the distance and the chimney pots of La Pedrera on the next block.  ¡Gracias!

The other front desk and front door staff quickly learned our room number and were always helpful and cheerful greeting us and offering assistance coming or going.  We didn't get their names, but they were all great.  Gracias señores.

And the housekeeping staff were unfailingly pleasant and efficient.  Gracias, señoras.

The room was very nice, with an extraordinarily comfortable king-sized (or maybe California king) bed.  The room overlooked the peaceful garden which made it very quiet.  The bathroom was very modern, with a large shower, and an enormous bathtub and double-sink vanity.  There was no door between the ""wet"" room and the passage leading to the sleeping area, but the toilet was located in its own ""water closet"" with a door so no issues there.  The room was furnished with a comfortable version of a Barcelona chair (of course) and small desk and chair.  Lots of storage and even an iron and ironing board, not common in hotels in Spain.

We enjoyed tea in the garden one afternoon and a fabulous dinner in the Alma restaurant which I will hopefully write up as a separate entry---but it was delicious and the service was excellent and the talented chef even came out to chat to us about the meal afterwards.. . Like how nice is that?  

For us, the location of the Alma, just off Passeig de Gracia, on pleasant Carrer Mallorca, was perfect.  The Alma is within a reasonable walking radius of several well-known apartment buildings designed by Gaudí, the Sagrada Familia, Plaça Catalunya, the Barri Gótico and Las Ramblas.  The Passeig de Gracia is itself a high end shopping street in a higher end shopping area. The area is packed with fanciful early 20th century Beaux-Arts-Barcelona buildings.   Before having dinner at the hotel restaurant, we also found a couple of excellent restaurants within walking distance.

If we return to Barcelona we would stay again at the Alma Hotel Barcelona without a second thought.",5,2019,03,24

40,Another great stay at the Alma,"The Alma is truly the finest hotel in Barcelona.  From the wonderful  rooms with incredible beds and  modern decor. The peaceful back garden and exceptional bar and restaurant. This hotel offers a truly remarkably experience for the most discerning traveler. Located in the Eixample District, very close to shops and fantastic restaurants. The staff  is incredible and always makes our stay special. They concierge service is superior and will always recommends great restaurants  and gives level of service that is second to none.  If you are looking for a luxury experience in Barcelona, choose the Alma Barcelona",5,2019,03,04
40,Couldn't have been better,"We have just come back from a 4 day stay in the Alma hotel. We know the city well and have stayed in other hotels, but this surpasses them all. The design is beautiful without feeling intimidating. We had a meal in the restaurant which was superb. Our room was lovely with a fabulously comfortable bed and bathroom facilities. But over and beyond all this was the attitude of the staff who were always pleasant, helpful and went out of their way to make sure that we were happy. It was a rare pleasure to stay there.",5,2019,03,04
40,Wonderful hotel and location,We loved The Alma. It has a wonderful calm and sophisticated ambience but with a very warm heart. The staff were brilliant and they went out of their way to help us get reservations at hard to get restaurants. We will definitely return.,5,2019,02,23
40,Great hotel in an amazing city,"The Alma is modern and historic in every sense. Compared to most European hotels, large high quality rooms with ample mini bar and extremely comfortable beds.. Absolutely five star staff. Ideal location in the city and the best garden bar and restaurant I could find.",5,2019,02,17
40,stay with friends,"to summarize our stay briefly

staff is extremely kind, breakfast is perfect, rooms are good
location ideal - nearby Passeig de Gracia

we would not doubt to visit the hotel again .

thank you Hotel Alma.",5,2019,02,11
40,Perfect location for a city break in Barcelona,"Passeig de Gràcia is one of the major avenues in Barcelona – its perfect for shopping, dining and also home to one of Gaudi’s masterpieces, Casa Batlló. A stone’s throw away from this major tourist attraction is the minimalistic and elegant Hotel Alma. The beauty of this hotel is that even though it’s in the middle of the city, it has a large stunning manicured garden area for dining and a cozy, roof top garden for drinks. The property is more of a sophisticated adult retreat than a family hotel, but saying that it does cater for kids upon request. All the rooms only have fingerprint locks instead of room key; shutter blinds for curtains and the interiors are neutral and masculine toned. For the best view I would suggest requesting a Grand Deluxe room as they offer views of Gaudi's iconic wavy-stone La Pedrera building.",5,2019,02,11
40,"Lovely hotel, great service ","I just returned from a 3-day stay in Barcelona, where I lodged at the Alma. I selected the hotel based on location to my business
Meetings, and on the great Trip Advisor reviews. I couldn’t have been more pleased with the hotel, and the service. My experience started when I made a joke at check-in about needing a glass of wine instead of the water that was offered at check-in. Immediately I was asked if I really wanted a glass of wine, and one was brought to me within a minute or two. That same level of customer support was evident during my 3 days. The hotel itself has an elegantly contemporary vibe. If weather permits, take a drink on the back patio, which is a lovely green oasis.  

The hotel itself is just off of a major high-end shopping and restaurant district. Of more interest, Gracia is a 20 minute walk north, and the Gothic and El Born Barrios are 25 minutes south. Both walks are safe and pleasant. ",5,2019,02,02
40,Wonderful Relaxing Stay in a Great Part of the City!,"We stayed in the executive suite for about 5 nights. We are very picky about our accommodations and service and this hotel was top notch in its offerings, service and quality. 

We arrived while there was a taxi strike and the concierge really explained the city to us on a map in full detail. They were incredibly helpful. In our room we had a hairdryer, I asked for an iron and they also gave me an adapter for my hair iron, for those of you who are wondering what to pack or not pack.

The Turkish bath in the basement is a wonderful retreat from the busy Barcelona day. The beds were incredibly comfortable. We had a lovely stay.",5,2019,01,28
40,Perfect and peaceful place to stay!,"Brilliant experience and came for my December birthday trip with friends.Stayed here twice now and will always return.Beds so comfortable,rooms spotless,staff can't do enough for you.Restaurant comparatively expensive however,I had the best turbot I have ever tasted there.Have a beautiful cocktail in the tranquil outside courtyard or spend some time in the indoor pool. 
So convenient for shopping-trip out of the door straight to the best shops and only a 3 minute walk to the underground(clean and easy to navigate) if you wish to venture further afield. I just can't fault this stylish hotel.",5,2019,01,27
40,"Elegant, discreet, and wonderful service","Highly recommend the Alma Barcelona - beautiful and well-designed property, elegant and minimal rooms. Food is top-rate, and the common areas — restaurant, bar, courtyard, spa/pool — are all wonderful. Service is also excellent, very friendly and helpful staff.",5,2019,01,26
40,stylish hotel with great service,"I stay at the Alma regularly when in Barcelona on business. The hotel is well-located and the rooms are modern, comfortably functional and attractive. Excellent, thoughtful and consistent service. For example, once your data are on file you can go directly to your room on check in. The lobby, restaurant and bar are low-key but stylishly decorated, great to enjoy quiet time or a drink.

In fact my only complaint from the last stay is that the bar was closed for a private event, just when I was looking forward to relaxing with a beer.",4,2019,01,24
40,Alma: a hotel with soul,"Well located in Eixample near the heart of the city, in a typical Barcelona building redesigned with great style, and staffed by a refreshingly young, friendly and energetic team, this hotel has real soul: the soul of a modern, vibrant and sophisticated Barcelona. We loved our weekend stay here and, if we go back, we will return here. It is very good value for money. Our room looking onto the garden courtyard was quiet, very comfortable (huge double bed), and stylish. We slept well, and ate well. Our breakfast was generous and wholesome and (later, after walking the city all day) our tea with cake hit the spot. Our only gripe was that all our towels were changed after Day 1 which was quite unnecessary: a system needs to be put in place to discourage this practice. Stay there: you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,01,19
40,Design hotel but very confortable ,"Great location 
Nice and efficient service 
Rooms are well designed 
Good restaurant casual 
Well it’s a good deal and it’s prices are very fair .
Well done .
For once a design hotel is spacious and not at all an attitude style staff .",5,2019,01,19
40,Seniors Celebrating Anniversary,Excellent Staff! Responded to all questions and directions. Always available and accessible. Excellent Grand Deluxe Room. Amazing breakfasts. Looking forward to returning to Alma Barcelona. Thank you.,5,2019,01,13
40,Excellent - Again,"This was my third three-night stay at the Alma.  As usual, the service, room and overall experience were excellent.  On arrival, reception staff noted I had stayed there twice before and was booked into a room overlooking the street.  They offered to change that to what they said would be a quieter room above the garden area at the rear of the hotel.  After checking out the street view room, I kept it.  It was not that noisy, and offered an opportunity each morning to enjoy room service coffee and watch the neighborhood traffic below.

One reason I enjoy the Alma is its location.  It's within a modern walk to most anything a tourist would want to see, do, eat or drink.  For example, there is a convenient on-and-off bus stop nearby. and avenues lined with shops and restaurants are within one or two blocks from the hotel.

Making and confirming reservations at the Alma were easy and efficient.  Staff responded promptly to emails.  They offered suggestions on how to make sharing credit card information more secure.

As usual with European hotels, American travelers might need instruction on how to operate lighting, heating and cooling, shower controls and other amenities.  Consider taking a room that includes a bidet. Since the Alma uses fingerprint reader entry technology, there are no key cards to keep track of, misplace or replace.

The Alma remains my go-to Barcelona hotel.  I recommend it to anyone traveling there for business or pleasure.",5,2019,01,12
40,Christmas Vacation at the Alma,"I will highly recommend this Hotel. The location is exceptional, off Paseo the Gracia one block from Casa Mila and a couple from Casa Batlló. The ammenities are very nice, very modern, minimalistic, the rooms are very good size, comfy bed and great shower. Our room was overlooking the gardens and the roof of Casa Mila, which was a big plus. The staff really made the difference and made our stay a memorable one. I would definitely come back to the hotel next time I come to Barcelona.",5,2019,01,04
40,Exceptional experience,"Alma is a gem, I can’t recommend it highly enough. Why? Friendly, competent, professional staff; sleek (and spotless) rooms; elegant lobby; beautiful property; perfect location.  I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Barcelona. ",5,2019,01,01
40,Awesome ,"Quiet, elegant, but not fussy.  Close to everything and yet tucked away so it’s nice and quiet.  Great room. Great staff.  Food is delicious but we only at breakfast twice—which is a bit expensive but it is a vacation after all.   Just go already.  ",5,2018,12,31
40,Barcelona  week vacation,"My wife and I stayed for 6 nights at The Alma Hotel during Christmas week. It was a great experience, The rooms were very clean and comfortable....and the location was spot on... close to many attractions. The staff was very helpful during our stay.

40,"This is not just a hotel stay, but an experience!","This was one of three hotels I had considered when planning a trip to Barcelona with another couple.  We ended up staying at one of the others.  However, due to a flight cancellation, my husband and I stayed here instead of where the airline was putting us up.  What an amazing decision.  This is a state of the art building with zen architecture.  It has fabulous professional staff that makes you feel welcome.  The room had clean lines with a wonderful bathroom and fantastic shower.  

There is an excellent restaurant where we had lunch and dinner.  Fresh vegetables, wonderful flavors and the best beef I have had since Argentina.

This will be the place I stay for my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,11,30
40,Top Location. Top service.,"I loved the place. Nice bar. Excellent restaurant. Beautiful rooms.
And in the center of the center !
The service was fabulous.

40,OUTSTANDING,"As an experienced traveler visiting hotels over 100 days a year globally I can easily tell the best from average.
The location, service and quality of facilities is 5 star. The spa feels like you are in someones luxury home...that for me is as good as it gets.",5,2018,11,27
40,Friendly service ,"The staff bent over backwards to please. The hotel is central with good facilities. The room was comfortable and the breakfast was well provisioned. It is a modern hotel. The design has soft lighting and this is a question of taste. The rooms have open plan bathrooms which is important to know , so check when one books to ensure you are satisfied in case you want privacy. The suites have private bathrooms but are more expensive. ",5,2018,11,17
40,Hotel Alma Barcelona,"Perfect location, extremely helpful & attentive staff! Spacious room with very comfortable bedding and a very well laid out bathroom. We felt extremely comfortable the moment we stepped through the door. We love Barcelona, and when we return, we will return to the Alma.",5,2018,11,09
40,Oozing Class!!,"This hotel is very stylish but without the pretentious feel you can get in other high quality hotels. The staff are really welcoming, professional and attend to every detail without being over bearing. The bar and restaurant coupled with the most peaceful garden outside for guests to enjoy is all as good as it gets. The rooms are sophisticated and comfortable; excellent bathroom/ shower facilities and wonderfully comfortable bed. I’ll be back in Barcelona soon hopefully and I’ll be staying at the Alma!!",5,2018,11,08
40,luxury hotel,"I stayed with a friend for a week on october. The hotel is very stylish, stuff is very helpul giving tourism advices. location very central 3 min walk from the metro station - diagonl. the brekfast is delishes - buffet with a manu of hot dishes to order. buffet has a large variety of fresh juices, cheese, petit sandwiches, smoked salmon, salami, and so on. the hot dishes are cooked wounderfuly including pancakes,omlette and etc. the rooms well equiped and very stylish. you get a robe, slippers, hair dryer and more. in the bottom line staying in alma is a full part of the vacation experience for travelers who want to enjoy a luxury accomodation.",5,2018,11,07
40,Small Luxury well located,This hotel was a closed eyes bet and surprised in all areas. Small. Attentions. Good restaurant. Top notch location. Spacious rooms and no key needed for anything! Your finger prints opens you/ allows all areas. From lift to your floor to opening your hotel door. ,5,2018,10,28
40,Modern luxury,The Alma Hotel is located in a great part of town just a few blocks away from attractions and great food. We spent a week here and were immediately impressed by Sergi at the front desk. If you need anything he is sure to help. The staff working the bar and the garden are also outstanding. Highly recommend utilizing the spa downstairs. We basically had it to ourselves whenever we went down there. Incredibly relaxing. The breakfast is without a doubt exceptional but quite expensive (29 euro a person). Overall Alma is a fantastic high end modern hotel. Definitely recommend! ,5,2018,10,26
40,Absolutely Fabulous,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. from the location to the tasting dinner menu option tom its attentive employees, quiet beautiful room, comfy bed and the beautiful garden sitting area.  Id give Alma 10 starts if I could",5,2018,10,26

The only drawback is the menu of the restaurant which needs variety ..",5,2018,10,23
40,Impeccable location and services,"Walking from hotel to Casa Milà or Casa Batlló is less than 5 minutes. I stayed for 7 nights, all services were flawless. Staffs really showed their hospitality from every moment. Room is a little dark, but the mattress and pillows are the best I have ever experienced.",5,2018,10,19
40,Cool and precise.,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Alma - its was excellent, staff/food great, and rooms comfortable, if a little dark. We had kids too and they loved it - pool is useful, but the garden is absolutely fabulous. An oasis. We should have spent more time in the garden to be honest ...",5,2018,10,17
40,Visiting Barcelona for a well earned break after The Barcelona Iron man,"In every measure this is a great City Hotel. The facilities were very good, the room was beautifully designed and spacious, the restaurant and garden bar were exceptional and the staff were perfect. There was nothing that I could fault.",5,2018,10,17
40,Very pleasant and exquisite ,"The hotel is elegant and quiet, the service was outstanding and courteous, the restaurant outstanding,  taken together a wonderful experience. When I first arrived the assistant accommodated an early arrival.",5,2018,10,08
40,Very Bad experience,"I am writing this review in regards to one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had ‘thanks’ to the receptionist at the hotel. The receptionist in question was named María who’s arrogant attitude unfortunately made my stay at the hotel unenjoyable. When staying at a 5* hotel one of the crucial elements that makes it so is the service the staff at the hotel provide. However, this was not the case with María. When we arrived at the hotel María was the only member of staff at the reception and when I greeted her with ‘Hello’ looked up from her desk and then without a word continued to type on the computer. Then after more than a minute passed María finally greeted me with just the words ‘booking name?’. Despite an initial feeling of shock at this unacceptable level of service when checking-in at a hotel of this standard I just hoped it was a one off and perhaps a momentary lapse. The next day when I went down to reception I found out this unfortunately not the case with María. When I asked her for advice about local amenities and in general things to do in the area around the hotel it seemed to be a total chore. Without wanting to go on I feel I needed write this review as during our stay there were multiple times that Marías attitude and service let the hotel down massively. When an individual and staff member is the reason you would not stay at a hotel again then this is definitely something that needs to be reviewed. I am sure I will not be the only one that has experienced Marías unwarranted attitude and until her service is brought to the attention of the managers im sure I will not be the last!",1,2018,10,08
40,Large modern rooms,"We booked this last minute after a bad experience with an Airbnb. I love the Eixample neighborhood and this is a great spot close to shopping and local bistros while also within walking distance to Gaudi sites.

I was afraid this hotel was going to be too masculine, but it wasn’t at all. Superb service and darling cribs for little ones. We had a deluxe room on the second floor with views of the garden. I loved the floor to ceiling operable doors (they have glass hip level protection) for fresh air. The bathroom was large and spotless. 

The restaurant served excellent cocktails with fresh fruit and herbs. The only thing missing was an outside pool. Otherwise the hotel has comfy beds, nice room amenities for toddlers and helpful staff (although not ideal entering or exiting the hotel with a stroller-there are steps). We would stay here again. ",5,2018,10,04
40,Recent visit,"Excellent location.  Very large rooms and very quiet.  The staff was pleasant and very helpful; they gave us excellent restaurant recommendations.  The rooftop bar was closed for renovations, but the courtyard was like an oasis in this busy city.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,09,24
40,Lovely 3 night stay,"We stayed here for a few nights right after we disembarked our Mediterranean cruise.  We arrived early in the morning & requested an early check in & they accommodated us.  They quickly made arrangements to get a room ready for us... and had us return in about an hour & didn’t charge us an additional fee!  So we went in search of a place in the area for breakfast & we came across a really good bakery.  The staff was amazing!  The rooms have a fingerprint scanner for access! 

  Our room was spacious, and we had views of the rooftop of Gaudi’s La Pedera & views of the hotel gardens.  There’s a rooftop bar which is quaint.  The bed was so comfortable, my husband and I slept like babies- it was like sleeping on a cloud!  The hotel’s location is great, it’s right near the famous shopping street Passieg de Gracia and it’s close to Gaudi’s Casa Batllo.
  
  We either walked or took a taxi everywhere & it was very convenient.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The only thing I would stay away from, was the buffet breakfast in the restaurant in the lobby.  The food wasn’t good & it was very expensive, go for a walk to any of the nearby bakeries or restaurants- trust me.",5,2018,09,24
40,Almost excellent.,"Alma is in a good area of Barcelona with shops and eateries nearby. The arrival welcome is outstanding, staff are very friendly and always ready to help. The rooms are lovely and spacious with very comfortable beds. The accessible room we stayed had no bathroom door, so no privacy, a slider could easily be fitted . The breakfast was good but very expensive for what was on offer, but my greatest complaint was all the smokers in the garden, bearing in mind you are permitted to smoke in Spain whilst others are eating, it is not allowed in Australia so we had to move continually. Their inside eating was very small so not always a seat available. It would be good if the outside area was divided into smoking and non smoking areas so everyone could enjoy the garden. A very nice place to stay.",4,2018,09,24
40,Not impressed; Not for everyone,"This place is . . .  dark.  And spartan.  Read the other negative reviews.  The walls are dark, the floors are dark and the ceiling is dark.  The lighting consists of cold halogen spot lighting. The pictures on their web page have clearly been over exposed by photoshop to make them seem less dark.  This hotel was booked for me by a travel agent who handled my whole trip so I didn't personally pick this hotel.  As I said, the public areas are very dark.  I felt I was either in a max security jail or the matrix.  The rooms themselves were not dark.  They were spartan.  High ceilings, shutters on the windows, wood floor.  No carpet, no pictures on the walls.  The furniture was simple.  I felt like I was in a dorm room.  Due to the lack of softening elements the room had an echo.  In addition there was a musty smell.  This room was simply not a comfortable place to hang out it.  Very odd bathroom arrangements. The shower was difficult to operate but it did shower you with a lot of water and was comfortable.  the shower had the best shampoo holder I've ever experienced.  The storage areas were also well designed for functionality.
The staff was nice.
The hotel was apparently designed by ""award winning architects.""  I don't know. . . Frank Lloyd Wright was a great architect but his homes were unlivable.  I found this hotel just pain unpleasant.
If you are into radical modernist simplicity give it a try.  If you want plain old comfort go somewhere else.",2,2018,09,23
40,"Gorgeous, first-class hotel in great area in Barcelona","We stayed here for 4 nights and it was such a great experience! The hotel is located near Passieg de Gracia and is in a great neighborhood. If you're coming from the airport the hotel is centrally located if you take the Aerobus to Placa de Catalunya (about a 5-10 minute walk even with luggage). When we first arrived we sat in the garden for breakfast. Despite the hotel located in a popular area the garden was very quiet and peaceful and the food was delicious. The amenities are great here, too. The workout room was mostly cardio machines but had TRX and light weights too. The pool is beautiful and they have a steam room and sauna as well. Definitely check out the amenities during your stay. The hotel also has a rooftop that is beautiful and provides unique views of the city including Sagrada Familia. From our room we could see the tops of Gaudi's La Pedera. The area is safe and we walked almost everywhere, including late dinners and returning from the bars at night. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially for navigating different tourist locations, recommendations, transportation, etc. I would absolutely recommend staying here and we plan to stay here when we return to Barcelona!",5,2018,09,23
40,Barcelona in high comfort,"Barcelona is an exciting city, vibrant, soulful, rich in things and places to discover.
The Alma Barcelona turned out to be an excellent base to explore the city (from our room we could see the roof of Gaudi's La Pedrera), and a very comfortable place to relax (and possibly have dinner) in the evening after a full day strolling in the city or around.
Service is of high quality, discrete and effective.  Breakfast is amongst the best experienced in similar hotels, and enjoying it in the garden is a very cool way to start el dia.  In summary:  an excellent address and safe choice!",5,2018,09,21
40,First Class Trip,"Loved the Alma. Hotel is beautiful and the service is outstanding. When we arrived after our redeye flight from the US we were greeted with warm hospitality and relaxed in the garden until our room was ready and we were able to check in a few hours early. The concierge helped us find all the local spots to see. We had a grand deluxe room on the 3rd floor with a view of the garden and it was fantastic. Most comfortable bed in a hotel I have ever had. Room was spotless and bathroom was spacious. The service was superb, from twice daily housekeeping to the service in the bar and garden. Food was amazing, we had dinner at the restaurant and Would definitely recommend it at least once during your stay. We stayed for a week and didn’t want to go home. Located close to everything you would want to see in Barcelona with easy access to subway. The definition of a 5-star hotel. Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2018,09,20
40,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"I've stayed in hundreds of hotels and the best and most memorable experience I've ever had was at the Alma Barcelona. The service is warm, friendly and super helpful, more so than any hotel I've experienced.

40,Fabulous Hotel in Beautiful Barcelona,"There are many many luxury and 5 star hotels in Barcelona, especially in the Eixample neighborhood. It took me weeks of comparing and I was so so happy with my choice.

Firstly, this is ultra modern hotel with a perfect mix of being sleek and elegant yet staying true to the architecture and neighborhood. It is a refurbished building but the rooms are sleek, elegant and modern. My room faced the garden and was lovely and quiet.

The outdoor terrace is fantastic, the service is quick and with a smile (especially a shout out to the woman who is from India who remembered me and my drink and seat preference!).

Front desk service - AMAZING. So helpful, cheery and just wonderful. The were so welcoming with a glass of Cava after a long day of travel and just so informative and fantastic. The ultra modern lobby and desk area is like this clean and quiet paradise after the hustle and bustle of the city.

Food at hotel seems a little hit or miss. I think I missed, but it doesn't mean the food is not good. I would have given it another shot, but come on! I was in Barcelona!!

Location can't be beat. Around the corner from Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada - you name it , it is there. Plus walking distance to tons of neighborhoods. I walked down to Born for boutique shopping and all over the Ramblas area and was very happy to get back into the Eixample area. It's just the best and there are tons of lovely places to eat, drink and people watch.

In a nutshell, I was so please that I finished my holiday (after 10 days in Mallorca ) in Barcelona at this hotel. I will absolutely be back and can not wait!",5,2018,09,09
40,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location","I wrote a review in April, 2017 saying how much I loved this hotel and I would come back on my next visit to Barcelona.  My next visit came and indeed I did stay at the Alma and loved the hotel as much the 2nd time.  The staff is phenomenal.  They are so accommodating, nice and helpful.  The front office staff seems to do whatever it takes to satisfy the guests' needs even if it is not their assigned job.  I love the rooms.  We had the same room for each visit.  We splurged a bit by getting a suite.  The room, as well as the whole hotel, has such a peaceful, warm feel to it.  Our room was beautifully decorated.  The style is warm contemporary, two words that don't always go together.  There is  large courtyard in the back that is perfect for meal or just a cocktail.  again, it feel so peaceful sitting back there.  Service from the waiters and bartender was always great and friendly. The location is great.  In the middle of the city just off the Passeig de Gracia, the best shopping street in the city and a short walk to all the tourist attractions. I really can't think of a more perfect hotel.",5,2018,09,07
40,"Excellent garden - for breakfast. dinner or for a drink, weather permiting","We had a room with garden view - quite interesting for a city hotel, so centrally located. The room was big enough. Fingerprint locks are a highlight, and they operate well.
Breakfast has average choice, good quality. Service is very polite and friendly, but not extremely fast. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is very quiet. An outside pool would be a plus.",4,2018,09,05
40,Favorite Place!,"When we checked out of the Alma for the second time last fall, I never thought I would find my way back to this beautiful property in less than a year.  Circumstances brought us back to Barcelona and I felt my sister and daughter needed to experience the Alma with us.

We had been traveling for almost 3 weeks when we arrived at the Alma lobby and were greeted with a lovely glass of Cava.  Ahhhhhh.....it felt like we had arrived home.  Last time, we had upgraded to a larger room (executive?) but I had my sisters budget to work with this time and we opted for the Classic rooms.  I was prepared to be disappointed but I was more than thrilled with our room.  I loved the floor to ceiling windows that opened up, the huge shower, bath and all the storage space.  We all decided if this Alma room was on a cruise ship we could travel around the world, easy!  

The highlight of the Alma room is the ""Cloud"" that is what we call their beds.  It is literally the most comfortable bed you will ever sleep in.  Ever!  We were willing to forgo Barcelona night life and late dinners so we could return to the Cloud.  After being on your feet exploring the city for 11 miles a day, the Cloud is the remedy for your aching body.

Beyond the wonders of the room, the service at the Alma is exceptional.  My sister was in awe of the evening turn down service and I love the little fridge with complimentary beverages.  Everyone who works at the Alma is helpful, friendly and wonderful.  I laughed a little to my self one day when 2 lovely employees opened both doors for my exit onto the street.  I felt like the Queen was making her grand entrance to Barcelona.

I've been fortunate to stay at some beautiful hotels in my life, but this place is extra special for me.  My husband and I could never stay at any other property in Barcelona for fear that we'd be missing the Alma.  My daughter and sister are now converts as well.  It was the hotel highlight of our trip and I hope to see her again!",5,2018,09,04
40,"Great location, great staff, nice and clean room","We enjoyed our time here at Alma.  We liked the decor and how clean the room was.  The bed was large and comfortable.  The bathroom and shower were spacious with nice bath products, I believed that other upper scale rooms have even better bath products.  The onsite restaurant was hard for us to get in because we didn't book in advance, I'd recommend that you book in advance if you'd like to enjoy a meal there.  Check in process was quick and useful and we got our room right away.  If I have a chance to stay here again, I will. Oh, the location is awesome, shop until you dropped casa battlo and la pededra is so close.",5,2018,08,27
40,"Excellent location, Brilliant Rooms, 5* property in the heard of Barca!","Alma does a great job of combining the luxuries of a 5* hotel while also delivering on the promise of providing a fantastic customer experience for its guests.

We would like to thank the following people for making our stay absolutely memorable:
1) Maria Aranda - for being an amazing reservation and reception lead. She took out time to show us the property, help out with the room requests and always being there if we needed anything. 

2) Ingrid - for always checking in to see if our stay is going great. She is the glue that keeps the team together and works behind the scenes to ensure smooth operations. 

3) Sergi, Bruno, all the doormen plus the Indian server at the bar - you all were terrific during our entire stay there. Thank you for finding our lost AMEX card, for recommending the best cocktails, for arranging a pizza at 4 am in the morning and helping out with the luggage plus hailing cabs for us. 

4) Virginie B - she is a magician at the bar. She made some amazing cocktails and also recommended the best options for us to try out in Barcelona.

A special shout out to the two people who cover the night shift. These guys were super helpful in guiding our Uber driver finding the hotel location (we had an early morning flight).

Things we loved about the hotel:
- Excellent rooms. We had the Executive Suite that was much bigger than most of the suite's we have stayed in Europe.
- Amazing toiletries from Bvlgari - housekeeping team is solid for the turndown service as well.
- The pool is fantastic. Decent enough to do a couple of laps. The steam and sauna were good as well.
- Room service was prompt and on time.

Things which the hotel can improve upon
- Better TV's? For some reason, the TV's were not of good quality and didn't offer a great watching experience.
- Improvement in the room phone system. It would be nice to have a proper headset with dial-in numbers for the right services (E.g., housekeeping, room service, etc.) - Currently, there is just a red cordless set.
- More closet space to keep clothes. That would be a significant upgrade.

All in all - great stay! Thank you for the amazing hospitality guys!",5,2018,08,23

40,5 star service and facility,"Just finished 6 nights at the Alma Barcelona. Deluxe experience. 
It's in an ideal location with nearly everything, within walking distance yet a 
very quiet retreat to return to. I can't compliment the staff enough. They did
everything possible to make our stay go flawlessly. When we returned to
Barcelona I will stay at this hotel and I will highly recommend it to anyone. 
Our room overlooked the rooftop of Gaudi's Casa Mila. 
Comfortable for any age and occasion. 5 star.",5,2018,08,15
40,Loved our stay!,"This was a fantastic hotel! The staff is the biggest asset to this hotel and made our stay extremely enjoyable.
They have a beautiful garden bar / restaurant which is amazing at night to sit and enjoy a drinks. The bartender makes some really unique and delicious cocktails - definitely worth visiting even if you aren't staying in the hotel.

The room was spacious and the bed was super comfortable! The only drawback for me was the low lighting, I love a room with bright lights.

I also missed having an outdoor pool, but their spa area was great to unwind after a long day.

Can't wait to go back and stay for a longer time!",5,2018,08,13
40,Best Hotel Stay Ever,"We just got back from 7 magical days in Barcelona. The incredibly beautiful city was amazing and we were so lucky to have found the Alma Hotel. 

Super comfortable room with drowsy beds and fine linens, a bathroom and shower to die for, lovely public areas—especially the serene hidden garden. But lots of hotels can boast of amenities like those. What makes the Alma super special is the staff. 

Smiling, friendly housekeepers, excellent front desk and door staff, great room service and restaurant. Standouts include the most beautiful woman in Barcelona, Marie, who checked is in and helped us many times through the week. We can’t say enough about the magnificent Xavi, doorman extraordinaire. Jess in the garden is perfect. And Jonatan, the barista and latte artist, started every one of our days with creatively crafted coffee with beautiful hearts and flowers in the milk foam. 

We can’t wait to return to Barcelona next year and we would never stay anywhere other than Alma. ",5,2018,08,12
40,Barcelona 2018,"We absolutely loved this hotel.  The concierge was full of information, especially since there was a taxi strike while we were visiting.  The room was super comfortable, clean and with ample room for the two of us. We really enjoyed the breakfasts, lunches in the garden and drinks in the garden on warm summer evenings.",5,2018,08,11
40,Sleek relaxing stay,This is an excellent hotel.  Very calm and relaxing with an excellent location. You get to sit down when you check in which is a nice touch Beautiful garden bar and restaurant. There is also a roof top bar with good cocktails (not cheap).  Large bed with good pillows.  ,4,2018,08,11
40,Amazing Service,"Alma Barcelona has an excellent central location , the rooms were spotless and any requests made were actioned immediately. The reception & door staff were exceptional and following a very speedy & efficient check-in we were given information on the best local restaurant and a number of tips as to the best places to visit. The garden area at the rear was a real bonus for a relaxing evening drink and we will not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone considering visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,08,10
40,Amazing Hotel,"The Alma is a beautiful and calming hotel in the Xiample area of Barcelona. It offers a calm refuge from the busy streets. Check in is a relaxed sit down service with refreshments offered. The large center garden is a lovely spot for food and cocktails. The rooms are well appointed, quiet and comfortable.
The area in which the Alma surpasses the competition is the amazing service of their staff. All are excellent and go above and beyond expectations.
I arrived for a one night transit stay in March and was greeted as a previous customer  and upgraded to an executive suite.The bartender was so lovely with his recommendations for wine and tapas I did not feel as though I was traveling alone.

When my husband and I returned to stay at the beginning and end of our July trip we were treated as old friends. Spa services are excellent and the concierges are always ready with advice and help with reservations. On our final stay before departure we were upgraded to an executive suite.
The taxis were on strike of the morning of our departure, the Ubers were not operating and the hotel shuttle was full. Javi (sp?) drove us to the airport in his own car!
Stay here is you can, it is one of our favorite hotels ever.",5,2018,08,10
40,Didn’t Ever Want to Leave,"This was the best hotel experience in my life. The staff were attentive, friendly and very gracious. The room was spacious and luxurious. The amenities were lovely, and the restaurant was top-notch. Every last detail of our stay was serviced meticulously. Highly recommended. A special thanks to Xavi, Santi, María, Jaz, Carlos, Papa, Chef, and all the rest of the amazing staff. We’ll be back soon!  ",5,2018,08,07
40,"Oustanding experience!  The hotel is beautiful, but the staff are beyond amazing.","Wonderful hotel, centrally located, spotless everywhere, including the beautiful outdoor garden area.  The rooftop bar was inviting and comfortable in the evenings.  The restaurant served the most amazing food and our favorite out of all the restaurants we visited in Barcelona. The staff are attentive, caring and try to ensure all your needs are taken care of.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona and can't wait to go back again.  Top notch for sure!",5,2018,08,06
40,Perfect!,"I booked this after reading the reviews and was not disappointed. 
The room was beautiful, spotlessly clean and stocked with a free soft drink minibar. I am one of those people who can base the success of an entire holiday on how good the shower is and this didn't disappoint! The bed was possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept in, I almost missed some important city sights because I didn't want to get out of bed! 
The staff, especially Gabriella and Alexandra, could not have been more helpful, booking tickets for attractions and recommending fabulous local restaurants. We were given advice on what would need to be booked, opening times, anything we may need to know. There was a citywide taxi strike so they provided information about buses and metro routes. Everyone was efficient and professional while being friendly and approachable. I cannot emphasise enough how wonderful they all were.
We had breakfast here the first morning and it was so good, we went on to have it every day! The food was fresh, well presented and delicious. As it is served until 11am, we even managed an early trip to Park Guell one morning and had breakfast on our return. Highly recommended.
The hotel is an easy walk from the city centre and the beautiful Sagrada Familia is just down the road. There are two stunning buildings designed by Gaudi only metres from the front door. A perfect location.
The hotel has a roof terrace where we enjoyed a cocktail on our first night and a beautiful garden, a real delight in a city. We returned each day and had a drink in the garden before heading out for dinner. 
I could go on and on but suffice to say, I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to return soon.",5,2018,07,30
40,Best hotel period,"Let me start by saying that I am travelling a lot, at least two hotel stays a month on different hotels some are big American or European chains some are boutique hotels. 

Hotel Alma is by far the best hotel I have ever been at. The luxurious feeling is eminent, staff is ridiculously good and the decor is lovely and appealing to a Scandinavian person like me. 

They deliver some a high service without bowler hats, or a stiff tuxedo. You feel welcome and I feel like I fit in. I do not have a buttler at home, brass all over etc these type of hotels just make me feel strange. 

Alma is different. Staff is tidely dresssd: black sneakers, trousers and a white shirt and then the service just feels upright and honest. 

Facilities are good, the breakfast amazing, drinks in the bar good etc etc. 

If you want a getaway this is definitely the place to go. ",5,2018,07,30
40,quality hotel,"its just a very easy high quality hotel... food, staff an all others are taken care of.

40,Friendly and stylish hotel in super location,"We had a two night stay in this beautiful hotel. 
It is very stylish especially the lobby and rooms but still comes across as very friendly and personal. 
Staff at Reception and bar were particularly nice. 
We didn’t eat in the actual restaurant but the main garden/ bar and rooftop bar were both great for food and cocktails (and views!!).
Supremely comfortable beds but a/c was a little challenging in the room! 
Would recommend and would stay again.",5,2018,07,29
40,Excellent stay,I stayed at the Alma Hotel for one night with my family. We were welcomed with a smile and made to feel very comfortable. The rooms are lovely and a comfortable size. We needed 2 rooms; a huge bonus was having fingerprint identification instead of room keys which made it easy for my husband and I to go between the 2 rooms. The breakfast is delicious with a variety to please adults and kids. I would highly recommend staying there - the location is just fantastic. It is walking distance to some amazing restaurants and the main shopping street. The decor is beauitful - it is a beautiful space to be in.,5,2018,07,27
40,Super stylish & impeccable service. We LOVED it.,"We LOVED this place & felt it was very good value for money. Our room was huge & lovely. The Alma is super chic & very tasteful. It has a glorious garden & outdoor eating area as well. The location is ideal. The staff was helpful & very nice- they seemed very genuine & cool. The lobby was stunning. We will definitely go back, it had a terrific vibe! We stayed in 4 hotels in Spain this trip and this was by far, our fave.",5,2018,07,20
40,Superior experience,"You cannot go wrong here. The hotel is super chic, tucked away on a perfect block. The garden, rooftop and pool/sauna are beyond charming and restorative. The rooms are attractive and beds super comfortable. And the staff is exceeding professional and above all, warm and welcoming. One of the best experiences I've ever had!",5,2018,07,18
40,Alma without a doubt is a place to stay when in Barcelona,"A prime of service, attention to guests is one of the treasures of this Hotel, extraordinary cleanliness, fantastic restaurant, beautiful decor. The dedication of the professionals of this hotel proves that there is passion in what they do there.",5,2018,07,18
40,Great hotel in the center of Barcelona,"We stayed three nights in a deluxe suite at the Alma and we wish we had never left. The accommodations were excellent. It is a beautiful and modern hotel located within walking distance of every place you would want to go. The restaurant in the hotel is very good - we ate lunch there and were impressed by the quality of the food. As part of the restaurant, there is an outdoor garden area, which is very pleasant. There is a small fitness center, which we used. Most of all, the service was impeccable. Everyone was extremely helpful and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. They gave us good restaurant recommendations and arranged a private tour of the Sagrada Familia with a guide who is extremely knowledgeable about the cathedral (he has even done videos with a big Chinese company and has millions of followers there; and he added a tour of a 19th century hospital, Sant Pau, which is incredibly beautiful and should be on everyone's list of places to see in Barcelona). Everyone in our family gives the Alma our highest recommendation.",5,2018,07,11
40,Excellent ,"Alma is centrally located. It has very comfortable rooms with French doors, a great patio for drinks, a rooftop bar with a view, a very nice breakfast and importantly all around excellent service - efficient and polite. It’s a great boutique hotel. ",5,2018,07,06
40,Hidden Gem in the Heart of Barcelonal,"Location is fantastic.  You can walk to the old city.   Our room had a view of the rooftop chimneys of one of Gaudi's nearby buildings.  The Alma Hotel's garden is the hidden gem.  It was a delightful place to enjoy a drink, food, or work.  The garden was unexpected in this part of town.  The staff were sensational from arrival through departure.  Overall this was an exceptional experience!!",5,2018,07,06
40,Wonderful Stay,"We just spent 3 nights at the Alma at the beginning of our 2 week stay in Spain. We could not have chosen a better hotel.  The room had every amenity and a garden view, a delicious breakfast, amazing choice of bars, a spa downstairs and and ideal location.  We were a close walk from all the sights, the market, restaurants, cafes, and shopping.  It was easy to find our way around and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Definitely would recommend it to everyone.",5,2018,07,04
40,"Great Hotel, but slightly dysfunctional rooms","First, there are many positives about the Alma Barcelona. The location is outstanding. The staff are over the top. From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming, knowledgeable, anxious to help, and highly competent. The downstairs bar/restaurant, outside patio, and rooftop patio were all 5 star experiences. We stayed nearly a week, and enjoyed many aspects of our stay.

The problem is that the rooms are very stylish, but the emphasis on style left them somewhat dysfunctional. For example, it took us a few minutes to find the toilet in the room (!). It turns out to be in a separate room, behind a door in the entryway, that blends in perfectly with the entryway woodwork. So, on casual inspection, the room appears to have no toilet at all. It seemed less amusing at 2 am when my wife couldn't find it.

The shower is a lovely big shower with both an overhead ""rain"" fixture, and a hand-held fixture. All very nice. However, there is no door to the shower. A glass pain covers about half of the entrance, and the other half is open to the room. So the floor outside the shower was invariably wet. Additionally, the lack of a door meant that there was always a slight draft when showering. So, if you weren't exactly under the fixture, part of your body was cold. It looked great, but functionally it was bizarre.

The room has well hidden fixtures. They look quite nice when on - somewhat of a relaxed lighting. However, if you need real light at night, you're out of luck. The light switches themselves made no sense. Even after being there for nearly a week, we turned on the lights in the room and bathroom primarily by trial and error.

There is a very small, stylish desk, with a stylish chair. However, the chair has fixed legs, no wheels, so I nearly fell over a couple of times getting in/out of the chair.

There was no space for our luggage.

So, the room looks great! It's quite stylish. However, it just doesn't function particularly well.",4,2018,07,03
40,Very disappointed stay,"I love alma since I walk in but unfortunately I felt very disappointed after I left the hotel.

I left 2 shirts in the closet (yes I am 100% sure) and I had called/email the hotel but they said they didn’t find anything. I tried to heck again but they didn’t provide solutions just told me they find nothing. They claimed they provide personliazed and unique service but they didn’t try to help me to find my clothes back. 

I strongly suggest not to stay at this hotel or you should keep you eyes on your personal belongings coz once you forgot, that won’t help.",1,2018,07,03
40,EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT,"EVERYTHING is just perfect from welcoming nice staff till SUPER food!!! I would recommend it over and over again to everyone.location is just perfect
 !! in the centre of everything and near the fanciest street in Barca",5,2018,07,02
40,A perfect choice in Barcelona,"We stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel is well located, if you are looking for shopping (Passeo Gracia), or eating in the best local restaurants, but it is a little bit far from the main attractions, but transportation options in Barcelona are almost unlimited (walking is the best way to reach these sites),  so this is not a disadvantage.The hotel is a modern hotel with a very nice decoration.  We had an upgrade to a grand deluxe room.  The room is spacious, very clean, and well-appointed, although some basic elements were missing in the bathroom (women's kit). The staff is very polite and helpful. The garden is a magic urban piece and a lovely place to be in, after a long day of sightseeing and shopping in Barcelona. Breakfast is excellent! No doubt, that this will be our first choice during our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,06,30
40,Week end in Barcelona,"The ALMA hotel has been warmly recommended by a friend of mine and it was an excellent choice.
What a pleasure to take the breakfast in the garden or even just a drink in the evening in that quiet place.
So a great pleasure to spend 4 days in that amazing hotel in which I will come back.",5,2018,06,27
40,Great trip to Barcelona.  Exceptional hotel.  Awesome location and wonderful staff,"This hotel is truly a five star.  On your arrival you will find incredibly helpful, friendly, and warm staff.  Everyone was so professional.  The hotel itself is charming in a very sophisicated way.  From the peaceful garden to the roof top bar, and the large rooms, you will not be disappointed.  The rooms are spacious, very clean, and exceptionally well-appointed.  I have traveled internationally a lot and sometimes when you see the stars and guest ratings you can end up disappointed.  That will not happen at Hotel Alma.  Truly exceptional in all aspects.",5,2018,06,26
40,An amazing place to stay,We stayed at Hotel Alma for three nights in June. We were fortunate to have a free upgrade and stayed in one of their executive suites...fantastic! Everything you could possibly need...nothing was too much trouble...excellent service..clean and tidy. We didn't eat in the hotel as out sightseeing but the hotel was well located and we could have walked (although we did get on the bus or uber!) to a lot of the main attractions. Lovely place and would highly recommend.,5,2018,06,26
40,"Sophisticated, quiet, and lovely","Love this hotel - and will go back. Impressed with the service, rooms, and scenery. Just a wonderful escape from the city with excellent food, wine, and rooms. Also enjoyed the spa for a massage and it was quite nice.",5,2018,06,26
40,"Great Location, service oriented hotel","Great location for everything in Barcelona. One block to experience the shopping equivalent to Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive, within walking distance to 3 of Gaudi landmark structures .
The hotel is beautifully appointed and the service staff knows the meaning of customer service.
Highly recommend.",5,2018,06,25
40,Fabulous hotel,"Great location, service and near fantastic restaurants. Close to everything but far enough away from the tourist areas.  The staff were always smiling and happy to assist with anything. Would definitely return.",5,2018,06,22
40,"Great hotel, awesome service and amazing staff","Had the pleasure of staying here for 5 nights. It was largely an amazing experience. The rooms are spacious and functional. Staff were great. We were a Large group. But for the most of it the hotel managed to take great care of us. Their location is fantastic and loads of great eating spaces around us. Had a great time. If we’re in Barca next, we’re coming back here. ",4,2018,06,21
40,Spectacular,"The Alma is, hands down, one of the finest treasures we’ve ever found! I’ll start with the five star staff. “Chubby” is at the front desk and was so kind and accommodating. He is very knowledgeable and helped us with our travel schedule around Barcelona as well as showing us around the  impressive hotel. Hamza, Xavi and Artau were very attentive at the door and helping us get taxis. We were very impressed with our spacious room (608) fantastic view of the tranquil garden terrace ( have a relaxing drink or two) and the rooftop of Gaudi’s of La Peters. The housekeeping staff did an impeccable job the 3 days we stayed. Bottled water and a chocolate next to our pillows every night, clean towels, thick bathrobes and slippers! We had the Sunday brunch and it was also fantastic, as well as the tapas we ate every evening in the garden with our drinks( great bartenders too)
I’m telling you, this place is very special. We have been to Barcelona before and both of us agreed that from now on, ALMA will always be our “home” when we visit! ",5,2018,06,17
40,Amazing time in Barcelona,"4 days in Barcelona in Alma hotel; great location and such a nice stay! What a welcoming atmosphere! Beautiful hotel and great food.
The garden of the hotel: an oasis to spend some time with a book and one of their special teas..
Certainly a place to return!",5,2018,06,17
40,"Perfect stay, one of mine, if not “the one” preferred place to stay on a city scape","Perfect service, super minimalistic, versatile and silent room. Very comfortable bed. Totally enjoyable dine service at the lovely garden, and delicious breakfast. 
Staff super efficient and friendly. 
Certainly my place in Barcelona. Hope to come soon!!!",5,2018,06,14
40,Luxe in Barcelona,"It was a very good weekend in barcelona, amazing breakfast, very good staff. Huge room, and also good ameneties.

Right in the city centre, near the mains squares, and near all types of transportation.",5,2018,06,12
40,Much more Expected,"Being central in Barcelona gets it is a high grade without even checking in. The lobby place, outside terrace, atrium are so nice that sets the whole journey into a good mood. THAT is quite reversed when you enter the rooms which lack the warm environment and set in a normal resort room (the design.... not to talk about).

However the staff is very welcoming and professional to compensate.",4,2018,06,12
40,Graceful retreat in the city,"The Alma was the first hotel we stayed in during our recent two week trip to Spain.  And it was the one we enjoyed the most starting with the glass of Cava when we checked in.  The hotel is beautiful with a relaxing courtyard for evening drinks, the most beautiful breakfast each morning and contemporary rooms with great finishes and a terrific location for seeing Barcelona.  The staff was always helpful and friendly, the vibe in the lobby and bar was energetic yet refined.  We had a junior suite and the whole experience was worth the price. We will return to the Alma.  Just wish I had taken the slippers.  Great quality. Loved the finger tip for room access.",5,2018,06,11
40,Alma made us feel premium,"Well.... where do we start?

We would certainly recommended this hotel and it was worth every penny.

We had  a superior room which was stylish, practical, comfortable, well presented and above all clean. The spa area and two lane pool were excellent. It was hard to believe while being in the garden area and restaurant that we were in a city centre, due to the greenery and relaxing atmosphere. Furthermore the hotel is relatively close to a lot of different things to go and see.

The best part of the Hotel was the staff. Our only regret is that we did not take all of their names so that we could name and thank them all individually on here. 
The staff from top to bottom (i.e. The roof terrace bar down to the reception area and garden) made us feel so welcome by their friendliness and continual genuine indulgence of our school boy / girl attempts at speaking a few words in Spanish, 

We had a wonderful dinner in the garden restaurant, the recommended main course by the manager was excellent as was the wine recommended by the waiter, the manager even brought out the chef who warmly spoke to us about her main course recipe and the rest of our meal.

We would be on here for most of the day sharing our service highlights which even extended to the locals especially the gentleman who happened to be walking past the front of the hotel when the concierge was giving us directions to a restaurant. The gentleman said ""I'll walk you there,"" without breaking stride. We then proceeded to walk us there exchanging polite conversation and a recommendation to a local cocktail bar. With a handshake and best wishes he was gone and we were at the restaurant.

All in all we had a fantastic experience in the Alma and would definitely recommend it.

Thank you Alma for making a special birthday even more special.",5,2018,06,11
40,Beautiful boutique hotel,"What a lovely find in a great location close to shops, some excellent restaurants and Gaudi houses.  What attracted us was the serene garden and spacious rooms perfectly finished. All of the staff were extremely attentive with outstanding service.  Can’t recommend enough and looking forward to my next visit!",5,2018,06,09
40,Fabulous ,"Such nice staff
Great location 
Super clean
I highly recommend it 
The atmosphere is great, the tourists are friendly 
My husband and I will be back for sure
My family stays there all the time
Restaurants are close by 
Just love that hotel",5,2018,06,07
40,Service like no other,"Well located hotel with a wonderful garden.  Aside from perfectly maintained and tasteful installations, the service is what makes this hotel so special.  Every employee strives to help, and their attitude is genuine.  It is a wonderful place to stay in Barcelona and I highly recommend it.",5,2018,06,06
40,Tranquility in the middle of the city,Ok. It is expensive but worth every dime. Perfectly situated in the best part of Barcelona. Stylish. Large rooms. A wonderful garden. I cannot think of a better hotel to stay in Barcelona. Just one minor complaint - and it is minor - that is that the service in the garden is a bit unorganised and slow. But since the staff is so friendly and the garden is so nice it is fully forgiven.....,5,2018,05,27
40,As nice a room as I have had in Europe,"We had the standard room on the second -third- floor.. It was by Euro standards HUGE
I have had smaller rooms that the combined size of the separate toilet and shower/vanityy. Not a huge fan of door less showers as the whole floor get wet but it is not my house and they provide towels that could double as a blanket. The mimi bar is free, there is an included workout and steam rooms.  The lighting is very subdued.  My room was on the inside and the only noise I heard was a soprano practicing in the am. The bed was the standard thick supportive foam on a low platform..I slept very comfortably.  Never good get a handle on how to adjust the temp exactly but there were two windows that could be opened.  Only slight complaint is the lack of a comfortable chair or two as there was certainly enough room. The location was in walking distance of many locatons of interest and several Metro stops nearby....be VERY aware of pickpockets as I saw one trying to work on a victim and heard directly from a young woman whose purse had been taken..",5,2018,05,26
40,5 star perfection,"This hotel is a wonderful oasis of calm with the most attentive and caring staff.

Checkin is a graceful affair in the sprawling lobby and feels more like a casual chat with drinks on hand, a great first impression for a 5 star hotel that has a wood/Japanese feel to it.

The rooms are huge with a Zen like Japanese feel with sliding shutter doors on the windows in Delux Rooms with plenty of work space to sprawl out with pleasant garden views.

Nothing is too much trouble, the lock on my luggage was damaged and the quickly cut it off my case... my laundry was late due to a mistake and was delivered by the Manager with an apology and no charge. 

The staff everywhere in the hotel are pleasant and they lobby staff seem to always remember your name, a very nice touch.

The restaurant/bar/outdoor dining areas are all gorgeous and again a calming relaxed vibe.

Oh and if you like truffle then you're in for a treat as it seems to be in nearly everything you eat here !

The only down side is the pool in the basement is so shallow that you bang your knees on the bottom of the pool if you're of a reasonable height and it's cold - rather refreshing but unexpected.

Bathrooms have my favourite Malin + Goez Rum Bodywash too!

Defo my favourite hotel in Barcelona to date and can't wait to go back.",5,2018,05,20
40,Relaxing weekend in Barcelona,"I stayed for the first time in this hotel 3 years ago and I already loved it then. I was anxious to see if they kept up with the service. I must say that they didn’t disappoint me in any accounts. The rooms are spacious, minimalistic and yet tasteful. The service at the front desk is extremely attentive and accommodating. The garden is a heaven of peace in the middle of busy Barcelona. My favorite part of Alma Hotel was and remains their breakfast, which is one of the best among the very many hotels that I’ve stayed in the past decades. ",5,2018,05,20
40,Fantastic hotel and location ,This is THE hotel to stay in while in Barcelona. The location is fantastic and the garden area is amazing. You can’t be but satisfied staying at the Alma. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Breakfast is delicious and the overall menu is very good! ,5,2018,05,11
40,Beautiful hotel in great location,We stayed for five nights at the Alms.  We had a beautiful room.  The staff were incredibly helpful and the location was perfect for seeing the entire city. We walked everywhere and appreciated its quiet location. Close to shopping and restaurants.,5,2018,05,10
40,Great Hotel Great Location ,"A really beautiful hotel.
Staff were very polite and quick to check us in. 
Loved the finger print door system. Saves a lot of time rummaging around for cards and keys.
Nice big room with stylish modern minimal furniture, which over looked the garden area. A big big bed with just the softest linen.
Fab walk in shower, quirky hatch in the bathroom which really worked if you wanted to chat to your husband while you were in the bath!
Plenty of lovely smelling toiletries.
We didn’t eat at the hotel, but drank cocktails in the outside space. Service was slow as they were busy.

A great location, very central.
Only gripe would be, no hot drink making facilities in the room and breakfast wasn’t included in the £250 plus per night price!

40,Always Love Alma,"Whenever I am in Barcelona I stay at the Alma. Everything about the hotel is 5 Star, including the rooms, the staff and the facilities. The bar is especially great  - very welcoming, comfortable and with a super outdoor area in the courtyard. ",5,2018,05,06
40,Before a bike tour,"I found this perfect small very very stylish elegant but simple hotel in barcelona and we loved it.  The rooms are really spacious and everything works perfect .  Also the food was a wonderful surprise, breakfast very compleat dinner was really delicious and all the bar menu was so vast and carefully presented that we end up asking for doble of almost everything. 
Great situated , definitely my house in barcelona for now on .  ",5,2018,05,04
40,Company Director,"Great location. Stylish interiors. Excellent service and fabulous food. Courtyard garden makes this place truly special. Get a rear room overlooking this if you can. Spa looks amazing, I intend to return for a personal trip to enjoy this!",5,2018,04,20
40,Awesome location ,"Spend 4 nights at Alma, the staff at the front are very helpful and polite! I enjoyed my stay! The amenities are nice and very good quality! Bed is also comfortable. One thing was weird that I didn’t get turndown service till the last night and I didn’t get daily service for one of the days.. I didn’t mind it too much but it’s a service consistency you should know about :) ",4,2018,04,19
40,"Great city, great location and a  great hotel make for a wonderful family trip.  Our kids are ages 18,21,23","Location is great!  Barcelona is a walkable city.  No problem getting a taxi or the subway if needed for further places.   The rooms were clean, quiet and well appointed.  The lobby/ restaurant bar area and garden  were quiet and peaceful to relax after a long day.   The staff were exceptionally courteous, friendly and attentive.  They helped arrange tickets for museums and other sights. Gave us great advice on where to eat and excursions to take.   We really enjoyed our stay and feel it is worth the money",5,2018,04,16
40,Nice modern hotel,Great location to Gaudi sites as well as shopping. Rooftop bar has very creative drinks. And breakfast Is a work of art. Location is also close to the train station But away from the very tourist areas,5,2018,04,14
40,Marvellous personalised service,We had three lovely days in Barcelona. The Alma Hotel helped to make it a very enjoyable indeed. The way guests are treated from the very first moment they arrive in the hotel sees the scene for the whole experience. Nothing is too much trouble.,5,2018,04,09
40,barcelona overnight,"great stay. The beds are very comfortable, the people at the desk are brilliant and very well mannered. The location is perfect. I was driving through Barcelona (Spain to Italy) so it was the rest I needed.

40,Lovely Contemporary Beauty!,"Our Grand Deluxe room overlooking the interior courtyard was a welcome respite at the end of the day. Comfortable bed, linens and spacious bathroom with walk in shower, complimentary water and beverages in mini bar and friendly helpful staff in a great area for shopping and restaurants. My only issue was the music playing in the courtyard outside the bar kept me awake until midnight until I called the front desk and asked them to turn it down. ",4,2018,04,05
40,"A four-night stay, to relax and slowly enjoy Barcelona, after a very busy 12-day tour of Israel.","Alma is a great hotel, with clean modern decor and wonderful attention from a young, energetic, very helpful staff. Our room, 302, was delightfully oversized, with a sitting and desk area divided from the sleeping area. The hotel bar, serving tapas, was a favorite spot at end of day. The garden with trees and shrubs offers a delightful escape from the heart of cosmopolitan Barcelona. Breakfast and dinner should not be missed, even with so many other good choices in the city. The location is excellent for walking and makes all attractions easily reachable. We will be back!",5,2018,03,31
40,Very nice hotel in a good location,"Very nice room, good breakfasts.  Only complaint is that the cleanup times for the room and turn down were not consistent.  Some days, clean up of the room was late, and then turn down was pretty early.  Also, the number of towels was a little skimpy.  But, otherwise a really nice property and very nice staff.",5,2018,03,24
40,Very friendly staff in great location with calm and tranquility right in the city center,"Very nice and spacious room with view into the garden. Loved the breakfast, very vast choice and nicely decorated ambiance. Hotel is very close to the city centre and close to metro stations, shopping, sightseeing locations (Pedrera, Casa Battlo) in walking distance. The staff (reception, restaurant, cleaning ladies) very friendly and always helpful and professional.",5,2018,03,19
40,Excellent hotel in the center of Barcelona,"Great hotel in the center of Barcelona with many great shops. Perfect ambiance. No hectic hotel. Quiet hotel where you can relax from doing a day working, shopping or doing touristic trips. From the check in with wine of beer until check out all was perfect. I definitely will recommend this hotel to everybody who stays in Barcelone. It is not the cheapest hotel but worth every euro.",5,2018,03,17
40,Terrific,"Wonderfully located for the sights. Quiet. Staff as friendly and helpful as possible. You can search the town for your favorite tapas but it's probably this hotel's restaurant. And the courtyard is a beautiful oasis of peace - great for morning coffee, mid-day refreshment or a nightcap. I wish they had a coffee pot in the room, but that's a small thing. Highly recommended.",5,2018,03,13
40,Best time ever ,"I have stayed at luxury hotels around the world and this concierge service is the best I’ve ever experienced. They are top notch. Never a wait. Always attentive. The bar is quiet but has everything you need. I can’t say more great things about my trip. 

The best restaurants I visited were their recomendable. ",5,2018,02,23

Love every detail in every single moment.
I will definitely stay in Alma again for my next visit Barcelona. ",5,2018,02,12
40,Number one hotel in Barcelona,"We stayed at Alma Hotel January 7-14 2018. This hotel is outstanding one - in terms of service, design, location, people, rooms, breakfast, bar...  We were located right in the heart of the city, so nice to live in that place. People working at front office are the best - they know all the details about hotel, they are so helpful and professional. Breakfast is the most refined breakfast I ever had in my travel experience, all foods are so fresh, different and bio oriented. Rooms are beautiful, big, clean and the amenities come from Malin and Goetz - so all in one sentence - this hotel is number one in Barcelona and do not even hesitate to go or not. ",5,2018,01,23
40,Amazing Hotel!,"Hotel Alma was a very quaint hotel locate in the Gracia neighborhood near Passeig de Gracia. Passeg de Gracia is the Champs de Elysee of Barcelona. This has to be one of my favorite hotels I have ever stayed at in Europe. It is very chic and trendy. The service was impeccable.The attention to detail is unlike anything that I have ever seen. It has a wonderful bar and restaurant. I was unable to visit the rooftop bar along with the outdoor area due to the cold weather, but I am looking forward to revisiting the hotel in the warmer months. I highly recommend this hotel. It is away from the touristy area of Barcelona, but still close to the sites that you are looking to see.",5,2018,01,16
40,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic service - will stay again","This is a fantastically operated hotel, right in the heart of one of Barcelona's most desirable areas. I've been to the city on many different occasions and have to admit that the Alma is by far the best I have stayed in.

Rooms are beautifully appointed, light and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in! I would love to know what brand the mattresses are for my own home!

The service was outstanding on every level and with every member of staff we encountered. 

Breakfast food was of a very high quality, albeit somewhat expensive, and service was quick yet unintrusive.

The only disappointment was that the gym and pool areas were closed during our visit - and we booked our trip hoping to be able to use these after a busy day exploring the city. Hopefully this is now back up and running and I'm sure the area will be just as nice as the rest of the hotel!

All in all, this is a beautiful boutique-style hotel that will really make your trip. Don't hesitate to book!",5,2018,01,15
40,Amazing,"It was a very pleasent stay
Nice staff. Helped us a lot with all the info we asked for and neded.

The room was nice and cozy. The bed and all the facility was great.
I would defentley recommended this hotel to all my friends ",5,2018,01,14
40,Beautiful hotel with quiet rooms,"The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, we had a babystroller with us and they helped us get it down the front stairs every day. There was a weird little lift so it is accessible but it was quicker to just carry it down the stairs. (there is a lift for the rest of the hotel though that we used every day, just the ones at the front we carried the stroller). The rooms in itself where very nice but it was weird that the bathroom didn't have a door, I was there with my brother so we had to plan our showers. The toilet does have a door, luckily. We had a room at the back of the hotel so it was really quiet and we had a wonderfull view of the garden and the tops of La pedrera. Room was very clean, beds were comfortable and the fridge was restocked every day with complementary drinks. There were panels that you could role in front of the windows so the room was pitch black.",4,2018,01,14
40,"Wonderful hotel, well located and well managed","My daughter and I recently spent New Year’s Eve and the following week at the Hotel Alma. What a wonderful experience! The staff was excellent from the moment we arrived exhausted in the early morning to the moment they sent us off to the airport with coffee “to go”. Our room was lovely, clean and was well kept by the staff. The beds were almost too comfortable- we had to tear ourselves away from them in the morning. The courtyard is magnificent!!!! What a lovely spot to relax with a drink or coffee morning or night. The bar and restaurant were top notch. The location!  Right around the corner from practically everything. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience.",5,2018,01,08
40,Going Back a Third Time,"Have stayed at the Alma Barcelona twice, so far.  Plan to lodge there every time I'm in Barcelona.  The side street location is great.  Walkable to upscale shops, the Gothic Quarter, La Rambla (including the incredible Boqueria Food Market), indoor and outdoor dining and bars.  The hotel and rooms - including bathrooms - are clean and comfortable.  (Some suites include a bidet.)  The staff are friendly and efficient.  The on-site restaurant and lounge are pleasant places to relax when you choose not to go out.  You might meet some locals there.  Overall the Alma Barcelona is an excellent value.",5,2018,01,06
40,Watch out for fraud,"Beautiful hotel/location fantastic/breakfast great/loved outdoor space - also some real gems in the staff.  Pool lacks interest due to location in basement.  Ticks all boxes, however, sadly our credit card was defrauded during our stay.  5 mins after having drinks in bar, call in our room (appeared internal as not announced) spanish man purporting to be calling from bar (music in background).  Wanted to reconfirm credit card details (had room number/exact amount just spent/name) - all details on bar slip.  With hindsight we shouldn't have confirmed details - 5 mins later £800 was taken from our card.  Hotel very embarrassed and compensated us.  However, left us distrusting everything.  Still without proof ever been reported to the Police.  If I had been convinced hotel were striving to get to bottom of it, I would have left a much better review.  I felt they just wanted to brush under the carpet.",1,2018,01,03
40,Persnicketygirl,"
Hotel Alma combines understated elegance and zen. Perfect location on a quiet side street steps away from Passeig de Gracia, the optimal location when visiting Barcelona.

Gabriela, Frank, and Xavi were so helpful.
Rooms were sooo quiet; ours faced the beautiful courtyard. 

We loved the steam sauna and pool.

I’ll be back!

40,Very Good and Thoughtful Service,"Spent 6 nights at the hotel with family.  Location is ideal and convenient. Rooms and bathrooms are well maintained, good sized with good layout . Most pleased with the all the staff who are very thoughtful , organised and helpful. ",5,2017,12,31
40,A very nice stylish & conveniently located hotel,"Great location. A block away from Casa Mila. Many good restaurants nearby, asked their Receptions (Talisa, Garbriele, and a guy who advised us on this great seafood restaurant behind the hotel).  All staff very nice & helpful. All giving great recommendations. 

Love their mattress, soft comfortable yet not too wobbly. Nice lovely, clean smell of towels. They have nice toiletries, slippers...etc. 

Plus point is once you draw the curtains it’s pitch dark so I can get my quality beauty sleep. :) ",5,2017,12,18
40,What A Unique Approach To An Accomodation,"I really enjoy creative approaches in hotel stays. Alma has been one of the recent stays I have really enjoyed where they have taken a different approach on things. The modernity, calmness, dimness is perfectly matched. The hotel looks cramped but when you enter the rooms you enter a different atmosphere altogether where you have wide open spaces. Loved the creativeness.",5,2017,12,12
40,Excellent Staff and Great Location,Very good quiet hotel in a convenient location.  Very helpful front desk staff! Very good room service! Walked to almost all of the city highlights.  Short walk to public transportation if you need to travel farther.  Room that we stayed in could have had better lighting.  Nice bar although we did not eat at the restaurant.,4,2017,12,10
40,An excellent hotel,"The hotel is excellent, the rooms are good  although I like a room with more light. It seemed to be in a disco or something like this. You can have everything from the frigobar for free. I liked that very much. 
The staff was excellent, they spent lots of time trying to help me with a problem. 
The location is perfect for me, just two minutos walk from Paseo de Gracia, where you can find all the nice boutiques. There aré also very good restaurants nearby.",4,2017,12,06
40,Must stay,I book this hotel like I book hotels around but THIS IS AN AMAZING SURPRISE. clean. Silent. No keys to go around only use your finger print ! Friendly staff. Needed extended check out and it was promptly granted ! Location is very convenient. Breakfast is delicious. Cappuccino like in Italy. Rooms modern and clean. Cozy bed. I will definitely book again,5,2017,12,06
40,excellent service in great location,"Hotel is in an excellent location. A few minutes walk to the main attractions but outside the busy old district.  Hotel design felt very welcoming with a small foyer / reception area which then opened out into an internal void which went the height of the building.
Staff provided excellent service. Very helpful and friendly.

Room - spacious with big bathroom. plenty of natural light. Bed was very comfortable. Rooms were quiet. Amenities were very good. Room was clean and well serviced.
Facilities - an awesome outside courtyard to enjoy drinks.
Gym was adequate, but as it was next to sauna it was extremely hot.

Hotel has fingerprint technology for opening room door, which is an excellent idea and saves having to carry a key around. Why I did not rate this hotel as excellent was because the fingerprint technology would not work for me, even after many attempts by the staff to re-set it for me.  Once they fix this (or if it works for you) then I would rate the hotel as excellent.",4,2017,11,22
40,Personalised and good service!,"The staff was very friendly and really tried to accomodate in all possible ways. Nice room, and the way the entire hotel is refurbished is very good - have a look at the original stairways!
Also, good was good.
I will certainly be back!",5,2017,11,13
40,Nice stay at Hotel Alma,"Again a very nice stay at hotel Alma in Barcelona. The hotel is perfectly located close to many of the more famoud sights. The hotel is very good, the staff polite and offering splendid service, and the breakfast is excuisite. Highly recommended!",5,2017,11,12
40,Very Good Hotel.,"Excellent location right in the middle of Passeig De Gracia. 

Hotel Staff are very nice but somewhat lacking consideration. We had to upgrade to a room suite as hotel does not allow our 6 yr old kid to sleep with us in the normal room (otherwise need to pay extra) .  Other than that, all was well accommodated. 

PROS:
Fluent English speaking reception and staff. Warm and accommodating. 
Good Internet speeds of approx 5-10 mbps with symmetrical DL/UL speed. 
Nice toilet kit (Bvlgari Brand) which is replenished daily. Clean bathrooms. 
Perfect shower pressure at 10/10. 
Free Bottled water. (replenished daily).
Turndown service.
Magnificent garden area for breakfast. Outstanding dining options available. 

CONS:
Limited power outlets for charging.
Limited media channels for english speaking audience.
Bedroom TV is quite outdated.
Stayed at room 101 and the desk lamp was not working and the ceiling dim light kept on flicking (did not bother reporting due noticed last minute)

TIPS: 
Do bring a power strip/extension cord",4,2017,11,07
40,"Stylish, high end, comfortable","In October 2017 I stayed at the Alma twice (5 days apart) and would like to share a positive review.  I arrived from an overnight flight in the morning and was given my room immediately. That alone made an enormous difference.  Shortly after settling in my room, I realized that a wifi hotspot I had rented from a private company was not working.  I returned to the lobby to enquire as to where i might rent another.  The staff volunteered to rent one to me for the duration of my trip which included 5 days I wouldn’t be at their hotel.  Truly exceptional service. Later that day I began having trouble getting the door to my room to lock.  I was quickly moved to another room.  This was a terrific recovery.  The room itself was stylish and quite large.  The windows were very thick and insulated me from street noise.  The linens were soft and high quality.  The amenities of the hotel were fantastic.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are a bit darker than a typical hotel, but I adapted to it and felt that it was part of the style being conveyed in the property.  If I could suggest anything, it would be that the pillows were too soft and there was a lack of electrical outlets for phones, laptops and such.  I paid extra to be in an executive suite and would gladly do it again.",5,2017,11,01
40,Nice cocktails and finger food,"We've been to this place for a public event at the terrace. The decor and the feeling is just the accurate for a sunset relax moment, unfortunately the side where you can see the sunset from was closed. The finger food was really nice as also the music.",4,2017,10,28
40,"A LUCKY PICK, BUT PERFECT","Our party of 5 needed a hotel for one night after our cruise. We are three seniors, and  our daughter with her husband. The hotel we booked pre cruise was sold out. After reading an exhausting amount of reviews, I chose this hotel and we chose a real gem. Perfect location, large, well appointed rooms. Check in was very easy, with a beverage being offered to us while going through the process. we were early, and did have to wait for our rooms to be ready, but there was a nice area with couches where we waited. The rooms are beautiful, large, and look onto a courtyard garden. Once in our rooms, we set out to explore the area. The hotel is discreetly set in a high end location. La Pedrera was visible from the french balcony in our room. We all met back up in our room and called for ice, as we wanted to have a beverage while discussing dinner plans. The ice, and glasses, were quickly delivered to our door! How nice. The beds were very comfortable, and our only issue with the room was how to work the light switches, user error. The three seniors stayed in the hotel for dinner. We started with a drink in the lovely garden area.  Wonderful food and service. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,26
40,"This hotel nails everything, down to the smallest details!","We stayed at this lovely hotel for three nights and had a wonderful experience from start to finish. Every aspect of our stay was about as close to perfect as it gets. 

Location: 10/10. The hotel sits just off of the bustling Passeig de Gracia on an attractive, quiet side street. You can walk to La Rambla, the Gothic Quarter, the beach at Barceloneta and all the major sights, but you're tucked away from the noisy crowds in a part of the city that is central without feeling overwhelmingly touristy. Excellent restaurants, countless places to grab drinks, and the best high-end shopping in Barcelona are all literally steps away. 

Checking in: 10/10. We arrived around 11:30 a.m. and were immediately offered complimentary cappuccinos in the garden. Our room was clean and ready for us and our bags were brought up. We were in and getting unpacked within 20 minutes. You're also about to exchange currency at the front desk for a better rate than you'd get at the airport -- up to $200 a day. 

The hotel experience: 10/10. The aesthetic and decor are modern and minimal and luxurious, with lots of black marble, low lighting, and some of the fluffiest mattresses and duvets you'll find at any hotel. There is a lovely garden hung with lanterns where you can sit and read a book during the day or have a cocktail and delicious tapas in the evening (evenings in the garden were typically a mix of hotel guests and locals, which is always a good sign). The keyless entry to the room was a great bonus -- with all the things you're already on high alert about when traveling (cash, passports, etc.), it was a bit of a relief to never have to think about the whereabouts of a room key. Spa-like marble rain showers and delicious Malin + Goetz products are exactly what you want on vacation, along with fluffy towels, robes and cozy slippers. There is a restaurant with excellent food, 24-hour room service, the strongest and most reliable WiFi we had in Barcelona, and a small but immaculate gym/spa area with a lap pool and steam room. 

The thing that really makes this hotel exceptional is its amazing staff. Everyone is warm, welcoming and professional to a fault. We asked for multiple recommendations from the receptionists and each wound up being fantastic (see: Gaudim for paella). Getting to talk to the charming Sonia at the bar every night made our trip truly memorable (plus, she and her colleagues whip up some of the most delicious cocktails we had in Barcelona!) 

In all, this hotel is a new favorite. There's nowhere else we'd stay in Barcelona -- and we look forward to coming back!",5,2017,10,24
40,Wow is right!  Wonderful ambiance and service,"Like others here, I cannot say enough good things about the Alma.

It's in a fantastic location -- just steps off the Passeig de Gracia, but away from the noise of that busy street.

The lobby and rooms are gorgeous.  The hotel is apparently six years old, but everything looks brand new.  The in-room amenities are first-rate:  free drinks in the minibar, Bulgari toiletries, huge bath sheets, etc.

But what really stands out is the friendly service.  As just one example, we arrived in Barcelona at about 9 am on a redeye from the U.S.  The hotel had already emailed us in advance.  At no extra charge, they had our room ready by 9:15.  They gave us coffee and tea during the very short time while we waited.  

The whole staff is kind, smiling, and great at English.  

I want to go back ASAP.  I've stayed at a number of nice hotels; this is one of the very best.  I salute the management and staff of the Alma for doing their jobs at such a high level.",5,2017,10,23
40,Wow! Best service ever and a gorgeous hotel,"I been lucky enough to stay in some gorgeous hotels and I hardly ever review them but this time I've just got too because no hotel I've ever stayed in has been a good as this! Yes it was a beautifully designed modern hotel with all the 5 star touches you would expect and what really made it exceptional was the incredible team they have at the hotel. They made me feel like the hotel was my home for the duration of my stay and that has never really happened to me before. From David at the door who welcomed me my first evening and who kept the swimming pool open for me a little longer so I could enjoy it, to Ingrid & Gerard at breakfast with their lovely smiles and did whatever they could to give me the breakfast I really wanted, to Frank at reception who was caring, thoughtful and meticulous - making sure I got to the airport on time and booking my trip for me to the Sagrada Familia and liaising with the tour provider; the attention to detail and care at this hotel is just exceptional. To all the team at the Alma - Thank you for looking after me and sending me back home refreshed and relaxed! I can't wait to come again and stay with you.",5,2017,10,18
40,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,My husband stayed at this hotel for two nights before and after our cruise.  We could not have enjoyed it more.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The location is excellent. Our room was beautiful.  My most favorite part of this hotel was the outdoor dining experience and the beautiful gardens for drinks and appetizers.  It was everything we had hoped for and more. We would never consider a different hotel if we were to go back to Barcelona.,5,2017,10,18
40,Fun and modern hotel in a really great location,"My husband and I just returned from two weeks in Spain and ended our trip with two evenings at the Alma in Barcelona. Friends from San Francisco had stayed at the Alma last year and raved about it. We liked the Alma very much. Firstly, the location is absolutely perfect. Steps from Passage de Gracia and all the high end shops and restaurants. The hotel is quiet because it's on a side street. If you get a room facing the garden - it's very lovely and tranquil. A real plus is the rear garden. You can eat and drink out of doors which is great if you like outdoor space (and I do). But the garden is popular - so if you want a drink before dinner, you must get there early to get a table. The hotels offers a wide range of rooms - some are more sparse and simple than others. If you're trying to save money, Alma offers some basic rooms for a mid range price. If you want to splurge, there are some opulent suites as well. Alma gets more points for offering a small gym and spa with steam, sauna and a small lap pool. Massages are available too. The concierges are amazing! We loved Frank and his colleagues. Gracias Frank for all of your assistance!! They really, really go above and beyond to please you. Dinner reservations and suggestions on what to do and see in Barcelona. No request is too taxing for them. We did not eat breakfast (it's a bit pricey) but it looked very nice. My only complaint is that the hotel does not offer hot pots in the room to make coffee or tea. Every other hotel we visited in Spain offers this necessary and contemporary feature. Ordering coffee from room service is available, but it takes some time and you'll pay 10 euro for a small pot barely enough for two. A hotel like Alma who prides itself on being contemporary should have a nespresso machine in the room. It's a perk guests really need and enjoy. Otherwise - Alma get's an A grade from me. I will definitely return one day.",5,2017,10,15
40,"Excellent rooms, food and service.","I highly recommend this hotel. Perfect location, great food, service and accommodations. Great location as you can walk to many of the sights, shops and restaurants. We really enjoyed the hotel and Barcelona!",5,2017,10,13
40,Fantastic hotel,"Can’t fault the Alma Barcelona. Lovely room, great atmosphere, enjoyable hidden courtyard bar area with great drinks menu. But what really made the visit special for me was the staff - five star quality from all who work there, you couldn’t really ask for more. I’d be perfectly happy staying again for both business and leisure trips.",5,2017,10,12
40,"Great Staff, Great hotel, Great location","Just spent 5 nights at Alma with my wife for vacation. The staff is superb! I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my day, both abroad and at home in the US. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us. It's also a great location! Close to La Rambla, lot's of great shops all around. Getting to the Gothic Quarter is only a 20 minute walk or a 5 minute cab walk. Alma also has a really great outdoor patio/garden area for drinks in casual chairs. There's also a nice looking restaurant although we didn't eat there. Reminded me of a cool bar I went to in Brooklyn once (can't remember the name). My favorite part was the finger print door room entry! No need to worry about losing or bringing a room key with me! Can't lose my thumb! Although my wife would tell me I'd find a way.",5,2017,10,10
40,Great hotel and very close to Casa Mila and Casa Balto,"Booked an executive suite because of the good reviews here in Tripadvisor.
The hotel occupies a historical building and a newer annex is built linking the older portion vide an atrium.  The suites are located in the heritage building facing the main street whilst the standard rooms are accommodated in the new annex with rooms facing the garden at the back.
Service of the hotel is great.  Quality of food is great, though we only had breakfast in the hotel during my stay here.  The quality of the breakfast is great but at a price; 28 Euro per person ++.
The size of the room is big by European standard, the suite has a high bathroom with separate bath and shower area.  Mini bar is free for guests staying in the suites.  They refilled the mini bar twice a day which is very generous by European standard.
The only down side is the lack of spare electric sockets to charge the phone and other electrical appliances.  Other than this, there isn't any fault which I could have picked.
Overall it's a Great hotel and particularly its great location.",4,2017,10,09
40,Fantastic!,"The hotel is very Clean, Lovely staff, the massage was amazing. The breakfast is really good whit a large choice. The only point I could find is getting your breakfast coffee take like 10-15 min. The terrace is great and quiet.",5,2017,10,08
40,An Oasis!,"We stayed at the Alma on 2 separate visits during our stay in Spain, beginning and end of trip.  I had booked it about 9 months prior to our visit, so the rates were a little lower and splurged on the executive suite.  It was spacious, luxurious and the best hotel we stayed during our 18 days in Spain.

The star system in Spain does not equal the star system in the US, but I felt the Alma was truly a 5-star by US standards.  Hospitality, soap larger than a nickle and Kleenex were not existent at the other properties we stayed at in Spain, but the Alma had it all and a lot more!  After being away from the Alma for 12 nights and saying in other ""luxury"" properties, we were so excited to get back to paradise....huge comfortable bed, multiple pillows, giant shower, giant bath tub, beautifully designed room, endless soap and toiletries, slippers, bath robes and most of all, a staff that smiled and was helpful and friendly.  

Everyone we encountered at the Alma was eager to help you and gave us excellent recommendations for dining.  The lovely garden area was also a nice respite from the busy city and a relaxing place to have a drink in the evening.  We ate tapas in the bar one night and the food was excellent.  Obviously a little pricier than on the street, like every hotel, but well worth the price for the quality.

I would highly recommend the Alma to anyone traveling to Barcelona and I would return without hesitation.  The location is excellent too.  We hiked everywhere and only needed a taxi to get to and from the airport.  The Alma and Barcelona was the best part of our trip.",5,2017,10,06
40,Great hotel,"We stayed here last year for me night prior to boarding a cruise ship and enjoyed it and vowed to come back for a longer break. One year later we arrived around 11.30am so we knew it was probably too earlier to get our room. The same concierge as last year greeted us.

Checking in though we had a beer, had our finger prints taken and chatted over various restaurants. We had a plan and that was to walk 15 minutes to Paco Meralgo a tapas restaurant which the lady on reception confirmed was her favourite too.

After lunch we reviewed a text from reception advising our restaurant for the evening was booked. We got into the room after lunch and it was a great room - an executive suite overlooking the main street. A huge bed, a very big room, double basin bathroom with separate large shower room, separate toilet and separate bath tub that was very big, easily fitting two people. Toiletries were first class, the fridge stocked with inclusive water, soft drinks and beer. 

The bar is reasonably priced for a hotel of this standing beer at €4, cava €7 and the outside area is an oasis of calm. We had dinner one night - might need a separate restaurant review but food was good. 

Breakfast is fabulous with a selection of egg cooked dishes mixed with tables of fruit, pastries, meats, fish etc. The orange juice freshly squeezed was lovely, coffee not so, in fact maybe a new blend is required or maybe that was just me. Of course you can go out and eat more cheaply but this is style and substance!

Our room was kept clean and tidy although I never saw the room maid at all - perhaps the finger print system says when you are in or out...

I tried out the pool which I had all to myself, the water temperature was fine, the water isn’t deep though at 90cm just enough to swim in and then the sauna room - repeat.

Some minor grumbles, the rooftop bar was closed for an event one evening and then closed for the season ahead of the proposed schedule so we didn’t get up there at all. I had asked for a restaurant reservation early in the morning by 15.30 it hadn’t been contacted and of course when they got through it was full - yes, I was a little miffed. Reception did call me back perhaps sensing my frustration and suggested going at opening time for a bar stool service which I decided against. The last niggle point was a description on the suite page of private transfer to/from the airport. I emailed a few days before leaving the UK to enquire and was advised of the rather steep price yet there was no mention of that on the room description page where other items which did have charges had this written in brackets and others mentioned ‘free’, please just describe services and choice can be made.

We will be back, it was a great stay.",5,2017,10,03
40,Short 3-day stay felt like a week,"Very pleasant upscale boutique hotelIn the middle of Barcelona. Spacious roomThat was well appointed.Elegant restaurant, spa services not too expensive.Spa facilitiesExcellent.Great service all around.Outdoor seating in the Courtyard if it wasn't raining.Quiet with music in the lounge but otherwise you might not even know you're In a packed hotel. Did not see/hear any families or kids. View from the roof bar was amazing.",5,2017,09,30
40,LOVED this hotel,"Everything about our experience here was well above average.  From the check-in process with the welcome drink and concierge service to the warm and friendly treatment in the bar and the restaurant, we were impressed at every turn.  The courtyard is lovely, the location is ideal and the rooms are well-appointed.  Will definitely stay here again!",5,2017,09,30
40,ALMA = A Luxury Modern Apartment in Sweet-Spot Barcelona,"On a bucket-list binge-junket to Barcelona and looking for a sweet-spot location that balanced transport, shopping, attractions, restaurants, nightlife, and sundry conveniences, ALMA was an absolute gem of a find.  

Seventy-something units inside a Rebooted 19th Century Office & Apartment Building in the Eixample Neighborhood Village, the lodging experience feels more like a pied-a-terre flat than the usual tourist-hoard hotel.....and after reveling in all the LaMerce Festival hoopla to the wee hours, it was the perfect landing for some peaceful rest just a couple miles trek from the epicenter of endless activity.

As ALMA is just steps from either the PG main train station (to the south) or the Diagnonal Metro Stop (to the north), you can get to anywhere in Barcelona-- actually in Spain for that matter-- in less than a ten minute walk from the hotel. The T10 Farecard you'll read about in travel blogs is a good deal....for less than $12, buy one at the RENFE Train to get from El Prat to PG in all of 26 minutes, and then use it nine more times on the local metro or other trains all around Barcelona.

We had an Executive Suite, listed at 500+sf, on the top floor. Check-In was somewhat hampered by the ""fingerprint coding"" system used for room access--  but a dose of Cava while you labor through it quickly dispels the angst.  We wound up with the old fashioned ""physical key"" as the desk agent coined.....and after sauntering through a modest sitting area that serves as a gathering spot from elevator banks on each side, we were off to our suite.

TA Reviewers opining on the sleek, minimalist décor themes are spot-on. The earth tones and blue-gray accents throughout the property may be too soothing for those looking for bright pastels and a lot of open sunlight.  Moreover, if your hotel druthers are for a bustling lobby and bar scene, you will likely be disappointed.  We were not-- and after getting more than enough amperage out on Las Ramblas, down in the Gothic Quarter, and over at Barcelonetta Beach, it was the perfect fit for us to quietly decompress and recuperate for more adventures in this great City.
 
The suite itself is a symmetrically square-shaped open-floor plan divided into two areas by a large center console that houses (oddly) back-to-back flat screen TVs, a mini-bar, and wardrobe storage.  Two sets of floor-to-ceiling windows flank the outside wall and bring in daylight to offset the darker-painted walls, woods, ceilings, and floors;  there are two parlor chairs and a workstation table in the living area; the sleeping area has another chair, night tables with lamps, and a king bed. The bathroom is bright and comparably large for Barcelona, with oversized rain tower stall shower, soaking tub, commode, bidet, and double vessel vanity.  Bonus Points noted for exceptional bath towels and designer toiletries too.

King Bed, linen, pillows, HVAC, power outlets, WiFI, cleanliness and comfort were all rated at or well above standard.  We crashed on the second day after the long flight and slept past midday undisturbed.....then went out on the PG for a quick bite and came back to a perfectly serviced room. We ordered breakfast through room service on the last day and it was delivered in less than 15 minutes. Most of all...every member of the hotel staff we came into was cordial, pleasant, and efficient-- and that really does make a difference.

There are two dining options at the hotel and a seasonal rooftop terrace bar.....we only ate light tapas the first night in the lovely outside garden-- it was unremarkable and somewhat pricey.....the adjoining restaurant looked better, and in fact, it was packed the couple times we peeked....but frankly with all the gastronomical pleasures in this great City, eating at the hotel is never a priority with us. The Roof-Top Terrace was open for libations only, but clearly powering down after what I suspect is a great summertime venue..... it purportedly is closing for the season in the next few days. We did not use the pool or spa.....but some incidental feedback from other guests sounded favorable.

Demerits....really hard to list without sounding picayune. The size of the storage drawers in the wardrobe dresser bank is limited; the light switches in the unit can be confusing, and do not tie-in all lamps in the suite; the windows have been locked shut so you can't go out on their balconies; and the complimentary mini-bar is somewhat lean and includes no snacks. Otherwise none of these can offset the top block rating experience IMHO. 

Bottom-Line:  Not for the budget-conscious, this is a value-proportionate choice for those who want a more relaxing residential setting in a sweet-spot Barcelona location. You can surely pay much less....and even more too for similar accommodations.....but I suspect that when evaluating ALMA in the comparables I have mentioned, you will be hard pressed to find a better alternative.  

TIP: SOLOMILLO (sounds Italian but is not) is an incredible Catalonian Steakhouse find in (of all surprising places) the Doubletree Alexandra Curio Hiltion Hotel just a couple blocks down Mallorca. Three kinds of prime beef, prepared to size and taste.....generous salads....incredible side dishes....served on rooftop courtyard with romantic ambiance. We ate at more than 20 places on this trip through Barcelona, San Sebastian, and Biarritz.....and this was  ABSOLUTELY the BEST and MOST UNEXPECTED FIND among it all.....EXTREMELY REASONABLE too.",5,2017,09,29
40,Nice Hotel,"Very nice boutique hotel in great location. Hotel has a nice feel to it - very quiet and laid back. The bar was busy every night but the restaurant had very few tables being used while we were there. 

Helpful staff - nothing seemed like too much trouble.",4,2017,09,28
40,"Amazing location, clean and cozy ! ","My friends and I stayed in Alma Barcelona for a few day while visiting Spain. Loved the location as it's in the hot shopping prestigious area of Passeig Gracia and not in the craziness of La Rambla but then walking distance from it and close to most of the best sight seeing spots ( Sagrada Familia ,Casa Batllo ,etc).
Alma is a chic contemporary style hotel with a cute garden, super friendly staff and good service. Rooms were clean and modern but make sure you get a higher level to have a nice view.We also loved the finger printing system to access our room.
Probably the only disappointment was that the garden was closed for breakfast.
All in all , highly recommended and would definitely go back there.",5,2017,09,27
40,Wonderful garden & service,Great service especially the concierge services are worth a 5*. Lovely garden too.  The price for a room and the breakfast was steep but most likely linked with the events that took place in Barcelona the week of of the trip.,4,2017,09,26
40,One of the most enjoyable stays,"I am writing this review a bit late, and really sorry, as I am just busy with too much work.

We stayed here in end of summer 2016 with my family. Must say that I am glad we chose this hotel for many reasons. We had the Alma Suite with the great Terrace outside and great View of the City and rooftops. The room was cozy with great daylight, was a bit noisy during the week, as it is right by Main Street, but nothing to bother, quiet enough to have a perfect sleep, we had chosen this room ourselves and as they also have rooms facing the courtyard. Minibar was filled with Beer and etc for free. the staff was very friendly, starting from the front desk, room service and restaurant downstairs for breakfast. the breakfast was but extensive but chic and enough I think, good selection of cheeses, bread, fruit, canapes, you can order omelettes, waffles and pancakes, had one of the best pancakes and omelettes there, fantastic.
Cannot say enough about the location, it is perfect, the whole 8 days we stayed, we basically did not need to use the taxi, great restaurants and everything walking distance, and also attractions close by.
I am really sorry that I cannot remember all the names, the young gentlemen and ladies at the front desk, the concierge, the restaurant staff, as they were all fantastic, making sure everything is perfect with your stay.
We will definitely stay at this hotel when we go back to Barcelona, would like to thank and compliment the staff and management for their great job.",5,2017,09,20
40,One of the Best Hotels I've ever stayed in,"I've stayed in Rtiz Carltons, Four Seasons, Waldorf Astorias, Peninsulas, etc... The Alma Barcelona is equally if not better than these worldwide recognized brands. 

Before we could even enter the hotel, one of the doormen rushed out to help us with our bags from the taxi and welcomed us with smiles. As soon as we sat down to start the check in process we were offered something to drink which was very much appreciated as we had just taken a bit of a long/hot taxi ride. 

When we attempted to check in early and our room wasn't available, (which we planned anyway since we arrived around 7 am) one of Alma's employees gave us a map and showed us where to walk for breakfast, tourist sites, and so forth. She was exceptionally friendly and got us all situated to check in (to include taking our fingerprints for the room key - yes how cool and futuristic is that!!!) as soon as the room was ready. 

When we returned from our quick site seeing, we rested in the lobby for about 45 minutes and next thing we knew, our room was ready around 11 am which was such a lovely surprise, especially since most hotel check inns are around 3. Additionally since we booked through hotwire I was worried I'd get treated like the scum of the hotel or given the worst room, I couldn't have been more wrong, they treated us just beautifully. 

As for the room itself, it was huge! Most rooms in Europe are small so we weren't expecting much, but this hotel room was twice maybe three times the size of a normal hotel room in the United States. The bed was so comfortable and luxurious and the shower was equally delicious.

The free mini bar was a nice little treat too, having cold water is something I always crave when staying in a hotel room.

I also want to take a moment to thank Sophie who helped us find a terrific authentic Spanish restaurant near the port that serves some of the best paella in Barcelona. We spent about 15 minutes sifting through places and she was in no rush and was extremely patient with me - not to mention she called the restaurant to secure our reservation. Sophie recommended Arrosseria L'arròs which was the best Spanish meal we had in Barcelona.

The only one minor tweak/suggestion I may offer is to improve the gym, it is very small with no free weights and only a few cardio machines. Don't get me wrong, I know people don't travel to Barcelona to work out but still it would have been nicer for those of us who enjoy our gyms. With that said, their indoor pool area was absolutely stunning, so I guess they made up for the tiny gym.

Can't wait to stay with the Alma in the future!! It was our pleasure to be your guests.",5,2017,09,19
40,Excellent Choice,"We stayed at this hotel during our anniversary trip we took to visit different places in Spain. I was very happy I chose to stay in Alma based on the reviews from Expedia and TripAdvisor. The hotel is located in a best location a tourist could ask for. Surrounded with a lot of gorgeous european architecture, high end shopping, excellent quality restaurants cafe and bars. The hotel was very very clean. The rooms were spacious, and all the furniture looked brand new. The staff were super professional and helpful. They would go over and beyond to make sure their guests are comfortable and have all they need while in Alma hotel. If i ever go back to barcelona, I will definitely stay in Alma hotel again given the fact that finding excellent quality hotels with reasonable price is almost impossible in europe.",5,2017,09,16
40,Barcelona: Boutique & Brilliant,"1week stay in grand deluxe courtyard view room. From initial reservation thru to checkout stay was seamless. Staff at every level: concierge, front desk, housekeeping, garden terrace restaurants, rooftop - impeccably courteous, high degree of personal service and efficient.  Rooms are not the pinnacle of luxury but lack in nothing - they are sleek and generous.  The green oasis of the courtyard and the stunning rooftop only emphasize what is already a beautiful hotel.  Understated luxury. 5* dining, 5* service, 5* rooms, 5* location. So looking forward to many return visits.",5,2017,09,13
40,Attention to detail,"We stayed in the the junior suite.
The hotel and staff were impeccable and their attention to detail was second to none.
We can't rate the food as we ate out in the city,but I'm guessing it would have been amazing.
The location was amazing and all the sightseeing attractions are within walking distance of between 5  to 20 minutes.
Loved our time here .",5,2017,09,12
40,Modern Hotel at a great location ,"We stayed at Alma during our couplea trip and we couldn't be more pleased. Although we arrives earlier than regular check-in time, our room was ready in 30 minutes. At first, the modern decor in the rooms made it look a little empty but we liked the simplicity of it more and more everyday of our stay. The staff was always helpful and they were spot on with their restaurant recommendations (definitely asked them first before you venture out). We drinked the best cocktails at the rooftop and enjoyed a lazy afternoon at the garden. And we definitely were amazed with the quality and the taste of the food we tried for breakfast. It wasn't cheap but definitely worth it! Lastly. The location couldn't be any better. 5 stars!!!",5,2017,09,11
40,Great hotel in an excellent location,"I enjoyed a lovely weekend stay here. The hotel is designed and decorated in a very stylish way. The staff are very professional and helpful and my room was more minimalist than luxurious but very well laid out.
The bathroom was fine but the mirror was only lit from above. Not sure why designers have not realised that mirrors should also be lit from the sides!
The breakfast was good and could be taken on the terrace...very pleasant.
One of the best features of the hotel is the garden...a great place to relax and enjoy a drink or two.
The hotel is very well located just off Passeig de Garcia.
A great hotel for either business or a leisure stay.",5,2017,09,09
40,One of the best night's sleep,"The room was very comfortable but the bed was the stand out feature - extremely comfortable (it was a shame I had to wake up at 5.30 to travel!). Very nice toiletries, free mini bar and overall good amenities.
The courtyard bar had a nice ambience.
The restaurant was excellent. Very good menu and well cooked, both for breakfast and dinner.
Only slight complaint was that the bar was meant to remain open until midnight and closed at least half an hour earlier.",4,2017,09,08
40,A few days in Barcelona,"Beautiful stay in Alma! Great check-in experience with an extremely informative concierge who booked us a fantastic dinner on our first night!! Nice lobby and very modern design!! Room is extremely modern with dim lighting! Great bathroom facilities!! Room extremely clean. Breakfast is nice for around 30 European tho there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants nearby!! This hotel is located near the high end stores like Louis Vuitton, Hermes etc so great location if you are here for a shopping trip!! Taxis are easily available or alternatively it is a nice walk down to the marina through Las ramblas!! Barcelona is a beautiful city with plenty to see and do!! The Gaudi buildings and La Sagrada familia is a must see!!
We had a lovely few days here in Alma and highly recommend it! Thankyou!!",5,2017,09,07
40,Smart and discreet,"I first stayed at this hotel last year for 2 nights and this year I was lucky enough to stay for 4 nights. I could happily stay for 8 next year but unfortunately not with the way the Euro is going at the moment! The key note of this hotel is discretion and although it looks a bit formal and stuffy it is not at all. It is a very relaxing space and has 3 great things going for it. Firstly the restaurant is uber cool (although I only had the amazing breakfast there). Secondly the roof terrace has great views with cocktails to match. Finally the garden is an oasis of calm and at night is simply gorgeous lit up by lanterns. The staff are ALL terrific too and take time to talk to you if you are interested in meeting charming people providing top class service. The only (slight) criticism is that the gym is a little depressing and the pool is very long but also very narrow, so when I'm swimming there's only one slow lane I'm afraid!",5,2017,09,06
40,FANTASTIC,"The ultimate in contemporary Spanish design, this property is centrally located opposite Louis Vuitton on Passeig de Gracia, and walking distance to anywhere you would want to go to, and Barcelona is the perfect pedestrian city.

I got the suite, and it is nothing short of fantastic, with Bulgari toiletries and hardwood floors, and fingerprint access. 

I would always stay at Hotel Alma",5,2017,09,06
40,One of our best experiences,"We spent four great nights here. Arriving late on a Thursday, Talia directed us to A nearby Restaurant where we had a beautiful Dinner of fresh fish.

The room was large  and high tech, with a large soaking tub  and a huge walk in rain shower . The bed was immense and comfortable with modern furnishings that created a Zen like ambience.  

My advice is to skip the 29 Euro breakfast in the hotel as the neighborhood is full of places to eat. The concierge made three dinner reservations for us and all were very good and within walking distance.

While not located in the bustling Las Ramblas district it's close, and delightfully quiet at night.   High end shopping is right outside as well as the centrally located Metro Station on Diagonal 

I've traveled all over Europe and this is one of my best experiences - at a very fair price . If you like a luxury hotel but need to keep to a budget, this is the place",5,2017,09,05
40,A very dark hotel,"Just about every wall in the public rooms of this hotel is painted pretty dark gray, and the lighting is kept low. I know this is supposed to be sexy, and there are hotels like it in NYC ... but I found it, well, a little hard to see where I was going. There is a flight of stairs to get into the hotel. No grab bars in the (very deluxe) bathroom. The room itself was very large, the bed huge and extremely comfortable, with separate down comforters for each person. Lots of closet space. Roof top bar that (weirdly) blocks off the view of La Pedrera (there is a better view from the hotel roof top deck on the corner across the street). Great location if you want to be in a quieter, more elegant part of Barcelona. We had to leave before breakfast, but I did notice that they charge you extra if you want eggs (!). -- I thought the hotel was a little pretentious and expensive.",4,2017,09,05
40,Central and quality,Great hotel very central with fabulous garden courtyard. Service great and welcome drink at reception. Great concierge. Quiet - rooms could do with more lighting but that is all modern hotels. Very clean. Will be back. ,5,2017,09,03
40,An overall excellent experience,"As soon as we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly, and offered complimentary drinks on arrival. Rooms are modern and immaculately clean. The food is absolutely delicious although rather pricey. Spa area is very well kept and the pool is warm and great for a morning swim. Overall a lovely hotel and would highly recommend for business trips or holidaying.",5,2017,08,31
40,Place for the soul ,"The name lives up to its promise: Alma is the place to please your soul. A very well designed (puristic and elegant) hotel. Wounderful, calm and spacious rooms,  a bar/living room to spend hours reading, a very friendly staff that truly makes you feel warmly welcomed and a great garden with terrific restaurant to completely relaxe and detach. One of my favorite hotels, will surely return again (and again and...).",5,2017,08,30
40,Excellent Service in a great neighborhood of Barcelona,I traveled with my husband for a week while he was working and so we needed a place that was comfortable after a long day but close enough to stuff that I could venture off alone. The hotel was close to the high end shopping and gaudi houses that you want to check out. The hotel staff was Exceptional. Sofia was extremely friendly and helpful. We have stayed in ritz and four seasons on previous trips and the staff here really went out of their way to make sure that the visit was a success. Ask the front desk staff for restaurant suggestions. My only  regret is that I did not ask them for every night. The roof top bar is gem. Also go to Casa Amatller. THey have English tours everyday at 11am and it is not crowded at all. NExt door at Case Batllo it is packed bu Amatller is a little known secret.,5,2017,08,30
40,"Super Hotel, authentic staff & great roof terrace","If you're looking for a quality boutique design hotel with authentic, genuine and helpful staff then this is the place. 

For our stay the roof terrace was a highlight. Take a glass of wine and enjoy the sunset and view over Barcelona. 

Happy to recommend. ",5,2017,08,28
40,"Short trip, awesome experience.","I previously read the reviews on here and am glad I did as they influenced my decision to stay here and was very happy with my choice. The staff here is outstanding, all of them. Sophia took her time to accommodate all of our needs.  The location was perfect for our needs as well. The restaurant staff was just as helpful and accommodating as well.The room was plenty big and with all the amenities we needed.   I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and anyone else. Big thanks to the staff for making our stay so welcoming!",5,2017,08,28
40,What a gem!,"We moved to this hotel rather short notice and were greeted and treated amazingly. After our previous accommodation turned out to be a tad too loud I followed one reviewer who described the alma as quiet and discreet. What a gem: the entrance is very unassuming right around the corner from Passaig de Gracia in a beautiful building. We were offered refreshments while checking out the room (yes we were so sleep deprived we needed to make sure it's quiet) and the host was incredibly nice. 
The room can be entered by finger print or old fashioned key. 
Just walking along the hallway it felt like a fortress: a little dark but  not uncomfortably so. Our room itself is gorgeous and clean and overlooked the garden. There are no carpets or window coverings made of fabric (great if youre allergic). There is a privacy screen you can slide followed by a heavy duty wooden panel to block out light and sound.
The bathroom was a dream: huge waterfall shower big enough to do yoga in and a tub and double vanity. The toilet was separate.
One thing I noticed during this trip to Europe: there is no privacy in bathrooms: either a glassdoor or no door...be sure you're traveling and sharing the room with someone your comfortable with :)
The hotel offers parking in the nearby garage at a discounted €30 a night, which is in line with other garages we checked out.
The room pricing was also very much inline: I felt I got way more than I paid! 
I can highly recommend this place and since I'm planning to come back to Barcelona I will return to this hotel! 
Thanks to Alma and the amazing staff who saved our vacation!

40,One of the best....,"Without a doubt one of the finest hotels I've stayed at. 
Beautiful rooms, incredible food, wonderful staff. 
Our family, and the family were were traveling with, enjoyed this fablulous hotel. From the minute we walked in we knew it was a special place. 
The location is superb - in an upscale neighbourhood a short distance away form the crowded tourist areas. 
The breakfast was simply outstanding, and the terrace stunning. 
The staff was professional, kind and compassionate. 
Treat yourself - you will not be disappointed.",5,2017,08,27
40,A Gem,"Alma is so discreet, it's a pleasant surprise how much they have to offer. The location is wonderful, just off a main street so you're close to all the action, but far enough away that it is still very quiet. The entrance is unassuming, and the lobby is hushed and comfortable - I don't think we ever saw other guests, so it felt like we had the entire hotel to ourselves. The rooms are lovely - beautifully decorated, well appointed, comfortable and a good size. We had two rooms - my mom in a standard and my husband and I in a suite. The staff was very accommodating and kind - my mom had been ill and befriended the cleaner who provided her with a steady supply of her favorite fruit juices. This simple gesture made a world of difference for us as my mom was very content staying in her room while my we spent time in the city. 
We were so pleasantly surprised when we went up to the rooftop, it is stunning! We had it entirely to ourselves, and the views are just incredible. I highly recommend going up for a drink.",5,2017,08,23
40,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed here for three nights in August. 
We were given a free upgrade on arrival which was brilliant as it was my birthday whilst we were staying there,so a nice surprise. 
The staff were very friendly and attentive, and knowledgeable of the city with good recommendations. 
The room was very modern and simple, very large and immaculately clean. 
The beds were so comfy, which was required after long days sight seeing.
The location is good, as you're away from the immediate hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to walk to all of it in around half an hour or so. 
The garden is beautiful, especially at night. 
The basement pool and spa is lovely, so tranquil and was actually a lovely escape from the heat outside. 
Overall a fab stay and we would highly recommend it if you're looking for a bit more than a place to just rest your head. ",5,2017,08,23
40,The Best hotel in Barcelona,"we booked two hotel for our stay in barcelona before and after the one week cruise we went to W hotel before our cruise and Alma after i wished i was booking them in Alma i loved the location , Service and more important was Staff they were very professional polite and friendly thank you for the best service will be back ..",5,2017,08,22
40,Simply the best,"Once you have found this hotel - there are no signs ! - it's absolutely fabulous . The interior design is right up to the minute , large contemporary quiet rooms with courtyard views . The staff are sensational . We were there at the time of the terrorist attack in Las Ramblas and the staff could not have been more helpful or reassuring . Don't stay anywhere else in Barcelona .",5,2017,08,19
40,Top notch hotel just at the right place downtown [new town] Barcelona.,"Stayed at the Alma from august 12th throughout the 19th 2017 and this place is great.

The best way to describe ALMA is very simple... it’s the hotel you won’t have anything to say, simply because the service is great, the restaurant is top notch and the personal remains low-key.

You never feel a big “commercial” drive of any type, No strange noises, or bad smells. The place is quiet; very quiet and discreet.

If you’re looking for hotel to party at or something similar, don’t go to ALAM. That’s the exact reason why I went there, most if not all reviews mention this peaceful environment.

Rooms are clean, very simple and contemporain design. The shower we had was immense and tall as the height of the ceiling must be around 12 feet. Really nice.

The terrasse in the back is one of the most beautiful terrasse downtown Barcelona.

Expect great things at ALAM.",5,2017,08,19
40,Stayed 1 night between cruises in April 2016,"We stayed in this hotel for one night after a transatlantic cruise before boarding another Med cruise to Venice. We had been in suite on Celebrity and this hotel room was as nice as our suite had been. We got to hotel in the afternoon after taking a tour with friends after we got off the first ship and after a short wait were able to get checked in and get our luggage up to our room. The lobby, reception area and restaurant all were clean and impressive. Since we were only staying one night we had deluxe room and ended up with one with two queen beds. The room was clean and the bathroom was nice but was one of those with an open shower which for some reason I always end up getting the whole floor wet. Seeing that we asked that they send up some extra towels which they did. Our room overlooked a garden and terrace which was nice and quiet. We had taken a rate that included a breakfast the next morning which was excellent and substantial. The only problem was getting Cafe American rather than espresso. Once that was solved it was a good breakfast. The hotel got us a driver and car rather than a taxi to go the ship the next morning as they said it was about the same cost. 

All and all I would recommend this hotel to people visiting Barcelona as it was convenient to the best parts of Barcelona including a lot of excellent restaurants.",4,2017,08,18
40,Love love love this hitel,"For someone that has travelled the equivalent of around mars four times in the last 10 years I can honestly say this is one of the best hotels I've stayed in.

Amazing service, by the concierge team by the receptionists by the people that helped us with our luggage!

The team managed to get us a reservation to one of the best restaurants in Barcelona with three hours notice.

The highlights  of our stay were the keyless entry to the rooms, the secret garden at the back of the hotel and the amazing wine selection. 

The location of the hotel was perfect and not too far to walk to some of the sights. ",5,2017,08,18
40,Great experience in Alma,"Alma is a peaceful and beautiful hotel in a good location in Barcelona. 

The room was spacious, nicely designed and well equipped. Mine was facing the courtyard and gardens so it was very quiet also. From the window I could see Casa Mila's tower. The door was opened with finger print which was very handy. 

The staff was very professional and proactive. They greeted me right when I stepped out of the taxi and were always ready to help.

The breakfast buffet was very good, food was fresh and well prepared. On the rooftop there a bar with amazing views over the city.

I recommend Alma warmly to anyone who wants the have a good hotel experince in Barcelona.",5,2017,08,17
40,Excellent service and location ,"I visited only for one night but was able to experience a very high standard of service from every single staff member I engaged with. This is a high quality hotel where you already expect a lot but the customer experience (from being friendly, helpful and effective) made this visit very personable and memorable. Congratulations to all the staff and the management in achieving this often difficult mix! 
The hotel is excellently located and provides a great refuge from the hustle just outside it's doors. The courtyard with all its greenery is perfect. 
All in all a great short visit. I would definitely return and recommend it to all. ",4,2017,08,16
40,Excellent Overall.,Very friendly helpful staff. Bed very comfortable and hotel very well located to walk or to grab a short taxi ride to points of interest. Very good restaurants close to the Hotel. A highlight for us was late night drinks in the beautiful courtyard garden located at the back of the hotel.,5,2017,08,15
40,Great hotel in excellent location.,"Staff couldn't have been better or more helpful.  Check in and out went very easy.  They gave great recommendations for shopping and restaurants, as well as which tours we may enjoy.  The bar next to the restaurant had a very nice selection of wines and tapas, as well as other sandwiches and light meals.  The roof top bar was fun and offered views of the city and the port.  We would stay here again!",5,2017,08,11
40,Great stay!!,"Wonderful experience staying at the Alma in Barcelona!   Great shopping and eateries near by and the hotel staff was super accommodating!  The front desk took care of calling us cabs, showing us points of interest on maps, booking tickets for Sagrada La Familia, and was just over all super helpful. 

Rooms were VERY clean and refreshed regularly throughout the day.  Minibar contents were included which was awesome and the hotel let us check in a bit early AND gave us an upgraded room!!

Fantastic place, location, and service overall!",5,2017,08,07
40,Location Location!,"Loved Alma Barcelona, particularly the roof top bar and the gardens!

Wonderful welcome whist checking in, restaurant tips and a couple of chilled glasses of Cava! Very civilised!

Stylish decor throughout, attentive staff and a calm and relaxed atmosphere. 

Our Junior Suite was both spacious and gorgeous, very well designed and carefully decorated with shades of taupe and mole. The bathroom was perfect with a large tub and walk in shower with lots of great toiletries. 

The free minibar was a lovely extra that meant there was always cold water in the room and a few chilled Beers after a hot day in the sun. 

Only niggle were the noise from the road, we were on the 4th floor( the highest for a junior Suite) and the cars, garbage trucks and motor bikes could be heard through the night. I did have ear plugs but these were not sufficient to block out the noise.

 I would suggest that the hotel invest in triple glazing it would take the experience from good to great!

",4,2017,08,05
40,Elegant modern design,"In the centre of  Barcelona shopping . Quiet, elegant and clean design hotel. professional staff.
Restaurant has a cute attractive outdoor court where you can  enjoy a a very good meal and listen to birds, you'd never know you are in the middle of a busy city. I loved it. Walking distance to the old city and also to the sea and marina.",5,2017,08,02
40,Beautiful hotel but with some flaws,"We stayed for eight nights in July 2017. The hotel is very well-located and is beautifully designed and furnished.  Service was also attentive , friendly and helpful.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  There are a few draw-backs though: we often did not have hot water in our room; or it took 20 minutes of running the water before it started heating up.  Fortunately this was in the middle of summer, but it can still be uncomfortable. There is not enough hooks for hanging things in the bathroom and there is no coffee or tea station in the room.  Also, housekeeping was extremely erratic; and on a number of days the housekeeping only arrived late afternoon to do a combined cleaning and ""turn-down"" service.

The breakfast is very good, but also very expensive.  The free minibar went a long way to put a smile on our faces though! All in all a good experience.",4,2017,08,02
40,Wonderful! ,"We flew into Barcelona before a cruise & chose to stay at the hotel Alma for 2 nights. We didn't get to stay long enough! It was in a great location & service was outstanding. We had the executive suite & it was spacious, immaculate & had wonderful bath products! Beds were soooo comfy & helped with the jet lag. Loved the rooftop terrace!! Food downstairs was delicious with a pretty view. Highly recommend staying here! ",5,2017,07,31
40,Perfect location,"Great place to stay, helpful friendly staff, rooms very clean & comfortable, very modern & classy, lots of space and a big long luggage shelf that was great very useful.  Bathroom beautiful, and easy finger print entry to your room and the coffee was good too.  The hotel is a little dark especially in the lift a little more lighting would be good. I'd certainly stay here again.",5,2017,07,28
40,Very nice hotel and staff,"My visit to hotel alma was very enjoyable. Everything thing was just perfect : the decoration , the servis ,the location .... My waitress Sonia was very helpful, frendly and the servis was excellent . I definitely recommend this hotel . See you soon",5,2017,07,28
40,My night in Barcelona ,"The room was very nice and clean and fully equipped. The front desk staff and also the concierge were attentive, efficient and tried to please in every way possible. The location of the hotel was very good and accessible to all parts in 
the center of the city. ",4,2017,07,27
40,Hope  to be honest but not to make it too popular!,"The Alma is a gem. Leave the hot city behind as you enter the dark and cool lobby and you are quickly invited to complimentary refreshment (something that continues in your room as free mini-bar) and offered the fingerprint room access method by very patient and caring staff.

Off to the rooms which are comfortable and classy minimalist with very nice touches and mine overlooked the tranquil private square to the north (rear) of the hotel.

I cant say enough about the kind staff and will return. The razor sharp table that lacerated my calf on the roof top view was an exceptional blip and unless this is more common than i believe will not temper by enthusiastic return.

Checkout was pain free and courteous. The lifts are utterly ridiculous and slow.",5,2017,07,27
40,Really comfortable and classy hotel in excellent location,"We were here for two nights at the end of a week's road trip across Spain, and certainly the Alma is now one of our favourite hotels. Located in Eixample, just a block away from Gaudi's Casa Mila and a short walk from the Sagrada Famiglia, it is in a nice neighborhood with high class shops like Cartier around the corner. The ambience and decor are modern and very cool. The reception staff are friendly and most eager to help; I can only remember the name of Andrea but they were all fantastic. 
The rooms are all operated on fingerprint recognition, and were well equipped and designed. Minibar items were free. USB charging slots were provided. The bed linen and mattresses were really comfortable. The only thing missing, which seems to be the case in most Spanish hotels, is a kettle for tea and coffee.
The ground floor restaurant and bar were wonderful and we had two great meals there, the gourmet tasting lunch in the outdoor garden area was especially memorable. Even more amazing were the views from the rooftop bar, where we could have stayed all evening to enjoy the lovely cocktails.Unfortunately we didn't have time to try the spa and pool.

This hotel thoroughly deserves its five star rating. We would certainly come back to stay next time in Barcelona.",5,2017,07,19
40,My fav hotel in Barcelona,"Let me list the advantages of this hotel:

1- Location
2- Very peaceful and nice garden
3- Amazing breakfast
4- Very comfortable Lobby
5- Very friendly staff
6- Clean rooms and very bright 

I just liked how comfort are the rooms and the I just felt like everything is bright in the room which I felt quiet relaxed. 
The breakfast got lots of varieties and the dining room is very convenient.

I just want to rate this boutique hotel as 5*!

Will def come again",5,2017,07,19
40,Lovely hotel in a great location ,"We stayed here just for a short layover on our honeymoon and we were very impressed with the hotel.

We were greeted with a glass of cava upon checking in and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.

The room was immaculate and the location, close to the classy district of Gracia, is perfect for exploring this fantastic city. 

Will look to stay here on future visits to Barcelona. 

",5,2017,07,18
40,Will definitely return,"First time staying at ALMA... will definitely return. The hotel we always stay at was booked so ALMA was chosen for our two night stay, Chosen mostly because of location a block from Passeio de Gracia and number of restaurants surrounding it. What a pleasant experience! Staff is incredible even escorting us to our room, welcome bottle of champagne delivered and free mini bar are just a few of so many pluses. Garden where morning tea and drinks and appetizers into late evening served seemed to be always open.",5,2017,07,14
40,Weekend in Barcelona,"We had a great time at the Alma - this is a beautiful hotel. Our room overlooked the garden and was very quiet. Everything was excellent - staff assistance, garden, roof-top cocktails... We really enjoyed escaping the heat and traffic in the garden.",5,2017,07,12
40,"Great staff, very good breakfast, perfect location.",Hotel's location is ideal for exploring Barcelona. It is close to many must-see places. Very good quality breakfast. Staff is very polite and the receptionists are always willing to help you and give you the best advices and tips about the town.,4,2017,07,12
40,Amazing stay,"What a great find.  Very friendly welcome.  Free glass of cava and room upgrade! The room had one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in!  Total black out blinds,  free mini bar. Great location, would love to be back there now! ",5,2017,07,10
40,"Amazing, Modern Hotel!","Fantastic room and service. Very helpful for first time travelers. All staff were amazing and helped with reservations and recommendations for the city. Great beds, very comfortable. Amazing food and outdoor patio. Highly recommend!",5,2017,07,09
40,Great location and wonderful service!,"Cannot speak highly enough about this hotel!  Room was wonderful, dined there at our only night in this hotel and were rewarded with a fine meal.  In addition, the concierge staff could not have been more helpful!  Fresh off the (delayed) plane from the US with timed and ticketed reservations at some of the Barcelona sites, the staff immediately checked us in, stowed our bags, and showed us to private changing rooms in the spa so we could freshen for our day in town.  Arranged for special indoor meal when their patio was full that night.  And the rooftop bar was rocking!!",5,2017,07,09
40,Service At Check-in Flawless,"We arrived in Barcelona around 9am this morning, like many travelers I like to think my expectations are reasonable, but when at at 5 star hotel I expect great service - otherwise what are you paying for! Alma staff, Chubby and Sophia, were welcoming, professional and absolutely amazingly had our room ready at 9am. After a 24 stint on on airplane this was a wonderful surprise to us, and a first at any hotel to have the room ready so early. They offered us a proper coffee or cava/beer etc. The service was seamless and the perfect blend of friendly (not over the top) but professional. Whilst I am writing the review a lady knocked on the door to give us a complimentary bottle of cava. Based on the service so far we will definitely be back",5,2017,07,09
40,Our second stay at Alma and better than the first ,"From checkin through to departure the Alma lived up to and exceeded our expectations, which were very high following our last visit 3 years ago. 

We arrived and served sparkling water on our arrival, given a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite and provided with brilliant service. Want to watch a rugby game on a Saturday morning in Barcelona being played in New Zealand? No problem sir, a message within 10 minutes identifying a bar within walking distance that would be screening the game. 

A hot day in Barcelona and a morning checkout? Yes leave your bags with us and please use the spa when you return to freshen up before your flight. The showers were like everything else's immaculate. Everything in between was excellent. One meal in the restaurant on our first night despite being fully booked was swiftly arranged. 

We've stayed in some wonderful hotels around the world and Alma Barcelona stands out as a real highlight. Great service, great location. 

See you again in 3 years or so!",5,2017,07,09
40,Again amazing ,"This is our 2nd time here & we absolutely love it. It's small & quiet, not like the big hotels, which we usually try not to stay at, only if there isn't boutique hotels available. We had a suite, which was gorgeous. They have Bvlgari amenities 🙌. The breakfast if not included is expensive. There are plenty of Cafe outside. It is right where all the shopping is. 👠👛👗
Can't wait to come back!! ",5,2017,07,07
40,The worst 5-star hotel I've ever been to.,"The hotel and rooms are very well designed aesthetically, but several of the outlets didn't work in my room, and when I asked for an outlet converter, I was given a malfunctioned one, and I had to request another to get a working one. There are visible holes and gaps between the sink pipe and the wall... Shocking quality control flaws for such a beautifully dedigned hotel, but the slack in quality control was also abundantly clear in the training and management of the hotel staff, who were unmistakably rude, cold, stiff, unfriendly, and just apathetic and uncaring about the guests' complaint, even unapologetic to the point of being arrogant, very disappointing and shocking for a 5 star hotel. The staff was so cold that you get the impression that if they were replaced by robots, you wouldn't notice any difference. Even the housekeeping staff were impolite and standoffish, I later foubd out that the entire region of Barcelona peopke despise tourists, and wouldn't hesitate to make their feelings about tourists known, this was evident the entire 4 days I was in Barcelona, and the Alma hotel experience was just totally consistent with this impression, from the private van drivers and private guides, yes, we had 3 private drivers and 3 private guides in 4 days for our various destinations around Barcelona, except for one female guide Anna who actually cracked a smile and was somewhat friendly, everyone else from the hotel to the restaurants to even the airport as we were leaving were all very rude and apathetic and impolite, further research online revealed this is a common impression shared by many who visit Barcelona, Alma is the norm, not the exception, unfortunately.",1,2017,07,05
40,Great hotel with great food.,"I stayed at this hotel with my wife in July of 2014.  It is my favorite of those I've visited in Barcelona.  The rooms are well laid out, although dark.  I've gone back to the hotel for breakfast in 2016 and just this morning, and that's why I'm writing this review now.  I read some reviews that complained about the price of breakfast.  But, it is an amazing breakfast for 29 Euros!  They have an incredible buffet in a beautiful setting with the best service you will encounter.  I regret not having the appetite to try everything.  ",5,2017,07,05
40,Good concierge service,"is a really confortable hotel, have all the necessary of the category, the hight ligth was the concierge who recomend and reserve for us, some great experiences at town, thank you for everything and for sure we will back",5,2017,07,05
40,A modern hotel close to all,"A really good hotel with a really charming team. Bed's quality was amazing !!
This hotel is quiet, close to subway, Casa Batlo, Cas Milà and Sagrada Familia.

For minus point :
Air cooler in our bedroom was a little bit noisy and bathroom's accessories could be more complete.
We have found the breakfast (really complete however) quite expensive (29€/p)",5,2017,07,04
40,It doesn't get any better than this!,"Amazing hotel in the heart of Barcelona; Perfect location, walking distance to all of the store and great restaurants as well as Casa Batlo. 
Beautiful hotel with a sleek and modern inside, spacious rooms and a not to be missed charming garden perfect for the after hour drinks. I highly recommend it.",5,2017,07,03
40,Stay HERE in Barcelona,"We had a fantastic stay in Barcelona at Alma Barcelona. We had a one day visit to the city before we met our guide for a wine tour through Ribera del Duero and La Rioja (La Dolce Vita wine tours: absolutely outstanding, btw). The staff at Alma deliver 5 star customer service. Gabriella, the woman who greeted us, could not have been nicer or more accommodating. We had timed tickets for a couple of attractions, and she processed our check in super efficiently, and even had our complimentary welcome drinks ready very quickly. We asked where to go for dinner, and she said she would see if they could accommodate us at the hotel's restaurant, or at another location. She called back quickly to tell us that they were fully booked in the garden restaurant, but they made a special accommodation and seated us inside. This is Ritz-Carlton type service, at a fraction of the price. The meal in the restaurant was excellent, and the wait staff also outstanding. The hotel staff was also very easy to work with to arrange transfers from the airport on arrival, and to the train station on departure. 

Rooms were good sized, very clean and filled with amenities. Beds were very comfortable. And a fully stocked mini-bar was included. Alma was a very pleasant surprise, and we will absolutely stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona, which will be for a bit longer; it's a wonderful city with a lot to do.

Kudos to Gabriella and her staff. She made our short stay superb, and memorable.",5,2017,07,02
40,Modern Hotel in Good Location,"My wife and I traveled to Spain with our two granddaughters and spent three nights in two rooms at the ALMA Hotel Barcelona.  The hotel was in a great location for our touring with shopping and restaurants nearby.  The hotel was quite modern and had the first fingerprint activated door ""keys"" I have ever seen. (Worked most of the time but still needs work.)  The staff was quite friendly, professional and accommodating.  Highly recommended for travel to Barcelona.",5,2017,06,30
40,Excellent hotel with amazing staff,"I have stayed in a few of hotels, but the customer service at Hotel Alma has been the best I have experienced. From the moment we arrived, staff was on hand to help and offered a drink while we checked in. Reception staff also were great at recommending places to eat and helped with arranging travel plans for the 4 days we were there for. 

The room was modern and comfy with a good little spa area to chill in after a lot of walking around in Barcelona. Also, 2 other great parts are the garden area which has a very relaxed vibe and the terrace bar. The terrace has fantastic views of the city.

Overall though, to sum up. Hotel Alma has been the best hotel I have stayed in and I would highly recommend anyone holidaying in Barcelona to book here, I will be telling work colleagues to book here as well. Definitely will be checking in again on my next visit.",5,2017,06,29
40,Short break,"Booked this hotel through Expedia not knowing what to expect. The place is at the hear of Barcelona, I have done a fair bit of traveling and rather particular. I was not disappointed and what makes this place is it's staff, pleasant, helpful, polite and treat people like friends. Defiantly look forward to come again.",4,2017,06,29
40,A great hotel to stay- definitely going to return,"Free mini bar, close to attractions and most importantly, friendly, helpful and cheerful staff.  I stayed there for four days and the service was great.   I will definitely return when I visit again.  You can get there easily via taxi.  We went there for lunch and it was great service and excellent food.",5,2017,06,28
40,The best hotel in Barcelona!,"I have stayed in a lot of hotels over my lifetime in places around the world but Hotel Alma tops them all!  They were most accommodating from the moment we set foot on their property to the moment we left bright and early (5 am) to catch our flight back to the US. We arrived at the hotel before check in time due to our cruise and they made us feel welcome by offering us coffee, drinks and even CAVA and did their best to get us a room by 10:30 am.  The rooms are ultra modern and super comfortable.  But the best part is their well trained staff.  We will be back for sure!",5,2017,06,27
40,Friendly Staff,"The Alma has the best customer service we have ever experienced.  My wife and I have stayed at hotels including the Ritz  Carlton New York, and the Alma scores equal best with the Ritz.  It begins at reception, where guests are invited to sit in armchairs, rather than standing facing a desk. It continues with the offer of a glass of Cava.  It continues with charming, friendly, and helpful staff, and the ingenious technical device of recording guest's fingerprint, to be used throughout the stay to open the room door. And that friendly reception service is there 24 hours of the day.   The room itself was excellent, quiet and comfortably air-conditioned, with daily changes of towels.  The hotel location is close to a Metro station, and it is easy to walk down the Rambla Cataluña (best shops!) to the famous Rambla itself.  As a final friendly service, some member of staff is waiting to greet and meet and open the door when you return to the hotel.  First class, deserves six stars not five.",5,2017,06,27
40,Alma Accolades,"My wife and I are staying at the Alma  Hotel in Barcelona for three nights before embarking on the Queen Victoria for a Mediterranean cruise to Venice.
We arrived early afternoon yesterday from the airport in a car arranged by the hotel. The driver pointed out places of interest on the way. At the hotel we were greeted by one of the receptionists who showed us to reception. We were seated and offered, coffee,water or sparkling wine
The receptionist did a good job of checking us in, including using our finger print in place of a key. She explained the  free wi fi and showed us the restaurant and bar.First impressions were excellent.
Our room is on the third floor and overlooks the charming garden area. The room is modern but with character. There is a wooden floor and wooden shutters for the windows which makes the room suitably dark. The bed is divine! Very deep mattress and warm but light duvets.
There is a ledge about three metres in length, so plenty of room for bags, I Pads, shopping etc.Above is a 60mm Lowe Tv with a high quality picture
The bathroom has two basins and a large walk in shower with both overhead large rain rose and a handheld wand. There is loads of hot water.The toilet is in its own room. The housekeeping is to a very high standard.
There is a more formal restaurant but we elected to have tapas and wine in the bar. We had a late breakfast in the dining room, which serves until 11am. My wife considers it the best hotel breakfast she has had.
At lunch time the restaurant is set up in the garden area which has large shade sails, it is a lovely area for a meal or drink.
I needed to have a work email printed, which the concierge sorted for me in less than two minutes.
The staff are uniformly efficient and friendly. They seem to enjoy having their guests to stay.
The Hotel is on Carrera Mallorca about 50 m to Passeig de Garcia with Lois Vuitton on the corner. Le Pedrera is about 300 m walk,Casa Batlio about 500m and Sagrada Familia 10 minutes walk away, so a wonderful location in a wonderful city
I normally review hotels after I have left and moved on, however the Alma is so good I am sharing the news now!

",5,2017,06,26
40,"Good Hotel, But Not Quite 5 Star Yet","Our feelings about this hotel is that this is a 4-Star hotel, trying to be a 5-Star hotel.  I will start with the positive:
- We had upgraded to an executive suite, and our room was huge!  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The bathroom had both a shower and tub, the products were very good, and overall, the decor was modern and top-notch.
- This location cannot be beat - right between La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.  If you do the hop on hop off, this is a perfect location as well.  We couldn't be happier with it.  

Now to the parts that we liked less:
- The breakfast cost per person was 29 Euro!  We never ate there as this price is absolutely insane for Spain, and from we could tell by glancing at the menu, they weren't serving lobster and champagne, so this felt like highway robbery
- The hotel advertises a finger scan system for room keys, but it was down when we arrived, went down the next day, so we had to re-do our scans, and generally took between 3-5 scans to actually work.  We literally never got into our room on the first scan once.
- Servicing of rooms is slow!  The second night we were there, we ordered some ice up, and it literally never arrived.  We asked for an ironing board the next night, and that took 35 minutes to come up.  Every morning at 10 AM the staff was knocking on our door to clean, which felt super early and a bit invasive.  
- Be careful when working with the concierge on reservations for activities and dinner.  What was helpful is that when we arrived, they let us know that most tourist stops, including each Gaudi attraction required tickets with times.  That being said, they made us way too nervous and we felt the need to start booking things right away.  We quickly learned we could just book through TripAdvisor ourselves, with less hassle, more flexibility, and only 24 hours in advance.  We made the mistake of booking La Sagrada Familia with them, and ended up with jus the basic ticket that couldn't be upgraded on location, and we were never asked a preference.  The restaurants they booked for us were good, but not outstanding.
- The ""spa"" is more of a basement pool, which is small, and not worth making time for.  

I would say that overall, we enjoyed our stay, but I think this hotel needs to fine-tune some things before it can be considered truly luxurious.",4,2017,06,25
40,Laid back and sweet people,"This hotel is in a pretty good location, kind of far from the beach but close to some of gaudi's work. The people that worked here were so kind and sweet. At first we diddnt understand the showe and had to call down and asked and they happily told us how to work it. They gave us a map and showed us where we should go in Barcelona. The hotel is very welcoming and I would definitely come back and recommend it. Their is a beautiful Gardin and you can have the breakfast their which is very good. They definitely deserve all the good reviews!!!",5,2017,06,25
40,Alma Hotel Barcelona,"This hotel is beautiful and stylish, the service is excellent and enthusiastic. The roof top bar has excellent views and the garden bar is relaxing. The bathroom didn't have a door and this is a little inconvenient if room service arrives whilst someone is taking a shower. Otherwise everything else was perfect.",5,2017,06,22
40,one of the best,"At Barcelona a travel like me have around 20 diferent options and for work i have visited all, this is one of the best, service outstanding, good bed, smiling team and good location, what also? don't think about and go!",5,2017,06,20
40,Wonderful hotel in Barcelona!,Stayed 2 nights in this hotel and everything was exceptional.  It is in a good location to walk to most points of interest.  The included minibar stocked with cold beverages (including beer) was a nice surprise.  Cocktails at the rooftop bar were sublime.,5,2017,06,19
40,A brilliant escape,"My daughter and I spent the May bank holiday weekend at Alma in Barcelona. What a beautiful hotel. The garden, the terrace, the rooms, the staff - all fabulous.

We did not eat as the food was expensive.
I will be back!",5,2017,06,16
40,Good but not great boutique business hotel,"Central location, very good service, spacious nice room, good buffet breakfast, very shallow warm indoor swimming pool, gym, sauna... We were staying for 2 nights paid by company otherwise it can be pricy. Everything is good but not Great!",4,2017,06,12
40,Oasis in the city,"A stunning hotel centrally located yet calm and peaceful. Staff looked after us and took time to explain about the hotel and to help us get our bearings.

The photography doesn't do the hotel justice, it is stunning.

Can't recommend highly enough",5,2017,06,11
40,"Great service, great hotel","First time in Barcelona and we acclimated well thanks to the welcoming staff at Alma.

Rooms were nice, modern, with contemporary design cues. 

The garden area was likewise very pleasant and overall the lobby, dining and lounge areas were very cozy. Perfect for summer cocktails. 

But where the hotel stood out was the service. One needs to commend the concierge / front desk. The attitude was ""can do"", and they were good at listening to what the customer needs.  

Talisa, Santiago, and (most specially) Francesco must be mentioned. Francesco patiently crafted an itinerary for us to go to Costa Brava and Girona. Very happy that we followed his recommendation/s. Even the rental car was well arranged.

Very good concierge team overall --- our needs were properly endorsed to the next shift (as opposed to the next shift being clueless for a few minutes which can be the norm elsewhere) . They did their homework.

Breakfast was likewise very good , with a nice spread of Spanish fare (which is very familiar to us from the Philippines).

Next trip definitely will stay at Alma again.

40,wonderful ,"Beautiful hotel
Very tranquil 
Lovely, polite staff 
Beds most comfortable thing ever 
All round good experience but I'd say the hotel was a little out of our league. However, we'd definitely come back and stay and would also recommend the hotel to family/friends. Big thank you to everyone there ",5,2017,06,08
40,Very good location and service.,"The Alma Hotel is the soul of Barcelonas nicest area for visitors, It is close to almost everything but not in the heart of crowded places. You can easily walk to Rambla or Catalunya square in less than 10 minutes or even better good shopping in Paseo de Gracia in just 1 minute.

The hotel is nice, clean and trendy. Good bar in the back yard, the indoor pool and Gym are quite small but works.

Bed and pillows are not as comfortable as in other hotels but they are not bad indeed. The amenities in the room are very basic, nothing special.

Breakfast is very good and hot options are tasty as well as the service in the whole hotel, people is always in good mood (everyone less one girl during check out )

One nice thing is the option for opening the  door of the room using your fingerprint, very useful.

I will return for sure !

First of all, every atmosphere is great!! 
Good location, even though it's not close to catalunya(4blocks), not complicated, conveinient, good to get along with local!
Also awsome sauna and swimming pool gave me a real rest!

Alma's backyard is fabulous to have a coffee or grab a bite!",5,2017,05,23
40,Alma Barcelona,"Wonderful Hotel!!  Very friendly and helpful staff who arranged for us to visit several of the Gaudi sites.  Also, the garden is really beautiful.  Nice place to have drinks and tapas in the evening.  Rooms are beautiful.  Ours looked out onto the garden.",5,2017,05,22
40,Couldn't have asked for better!,"The location to all the action is just amazing and it was also the most quiet.. there wasn't a sound around! I'm a travel agent and this was a fact finding mission for me. I will ALWAYS recommend ALMA first to my clients... always!  It's walking distance the a supermarket, cafe's, the high-end shopping, Latin and Gothic quarter... we walked for miles..!",5,2017,05,22
40,'Outstanding hotel and service',"The Alma is the perfect hotel in the best location - the personnel are outstanding, the rooms, bathrooms and decor are beautiful and the food is delicious. The hotel is an oasis in Barcelona - the courtyard is the perfect place to put your feet up after a long day of walking. The breakfast is a feast, for both your stomach and eyes and the beds are very comfortable.

I really must commend the Alma on their personnel - Alexandra, Talisa, the gentlemen at the front door, the staff in the dining room and bar are exceptional, kind , warm and very friendly.

We loved our stay at the Alma and would recommend everyone have the opportunity to experience this gracious hotel.",5,2017,05,22
40,Great location with outstanding services,"We stayed in the hotel for three nights.  Room size is reasonable but the location is great.  It is in the walking distance to Casa Mila, Casa Batllo and city center.  The breakfast  is good.  There is a small court yard in the back of the hotel.  The service is top notch.",5,2017,05,19
40,Perfect pleasure,"The Alma is pure pleasure - just off La Rambla - it is discretely a very fine hotel, muted colours excellent service, the rooms are elegant and very tastefully decorated - service is as you would expect brisk efficient and discrete, perfectly placed for all Barcelona's main attractions and some of the lesser known ones - would not want to stay anywhere else!",5,2017,05,17
40,Perfect,"The location, the staff and the hotel are all perfect. The hotel is within 2 minutes walk of La Pedrera and Casa Battlo.  The hotel restaurant is lovely and there's also plenty of restaurants nearby if you'd prefer not to eat at the hotel. 
We were given a complimentary room upgrade on arrival which was greatly appreciated. We stayed in an interior courtyard room on the 3rd floor and the solitude offered by this location is second to none. You would not know you were in the middle of Barcelona. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5,2017,05,17
40,Impeccable service and a great room,"On our latest trip to Barcelona we were fortunate to select a hotel that exceeded our expectations. From the great check in process, complete with a complimentary cafe courtado, we were treated with fantastic service and a great accommodation experience. We would highly recommend this hotel. To top it all off they had a fantastic garden courtyard where you could retreat for an after dinner cocktail. As an added bonus we got to see some of the cast of Game of Thrones! What a treat.",5,2017,05,16
40,Relaxed luxury,"We had a absolute wonderful stay i Barcelona and can completely recommend the Alma Hotel. Well situated, beautiful hotel with very nice rooms. Beautiful, calm and quiet courtyard. Luxurious in a nice relaxed, discreet way. 
Very nice and professional staff. Pleasant, polite and service minded in their behavior.",5,2017,05,14
40,Very overrated ,"Just stayed a few nights in lovely Barcelona. The Alma hotel has great reviews but I was so disappointed. Not a 5 star in my opinion. Housekeeping very inconsistent, staff in restaurant during breakfast were not very friendly nor accommodating. The room was comfortable but nothing luxurious.",3,2017,05,06
40,Impeccable; 11 out of 10,"Amazing atmosphere overall. The design of the hotel is very elegant and helps you to unwind after a day at the city. The location of the hotel is central and is close to several nice restaurants and a plethora of shops. Staff was very hospitable and helpful throughout our stay. Also, the garden of the hotel is beautiful, and the service was great.",5,2017,05,02
40,"Just Wow, home away from home.","Spending a week here late April to early May to visit Barcelona and watch Rafa in the Barcelona Open.  Staff, Hotel, Food, service is top notch -- even popped into the place next door for a drink that received the Top Hotel for 2016 -- not even close to the Alma.

Ask for Santi at the front desk, he was very accommodating and helped us plan days we already scheduled for.  Hit the Vinoteca de Torres next door for some great food too and the Mandarin's bar for some excellent cocktails.",5,2017,05,01
40,"Great Hotel, Central Location","I have stayed at the Alma a couple of times and absolutely love it, for a number of reasons.  The upscale hotel is very well-appointed and the rooms are quite nice.  The staff is extremely pleasant and attentive. And the hotel's central location is perfect for exploring all that Barcelona has to offer.  Lots of shopping and dining options are close-by, as is the metro.

 The Alma Barcelona also has a nice little courtyard, which is a perfect place to unwind and enjoy a crisp glass of Cava.

",5,2017,05,01
40,A beautiful home away from home with  excellent service,"The pleasure began when we arrived and were greeted with coffees, waters and an herb tea while we checked in. Rooms were comfortable, with a modern aesthetic. The staff provided intelligent and relaxed service, arranged tickets for us for a last-minute, same-day soccer match, provided recommendations for tapas and helped in every way.  Restaurant, Lounge and bar were welcoming, comfortable, filled with couches, comfortable chairs and came with thoughtful service and excellent food (small plates, meals and snacks) all day and night. Garden is gorgeous and great for  afternoon coffee! Location was perfect for walking to Gothic Quarter, the Casa Battlo and Las Pedrera and an easy taxi ride to Sagrada Familia. Neighborhood terrific for eating any time of day or night. Quiet location, with lively street scene one block away.",5,2017,04,30
40,Fabulous ,"We stayed here for three nights in a lovely room overlooking the garden.  We arrived very early (10.15am) but the hotel managed to find a room that was ready, although they would have stored our luggage if not, as they did after we checked out. Coffee was provided during the check in process. Room was well equipped with huge comfy bed and great leather chair with footstool. Also free minibar with soft drinks and a couple of beers. Bathroom had bath, separate showers and double sinks; toilet in separate area. 

Only minor quibble would be rather low lighting level in corridors and very small signs for toilets which may not suit those with poor eyesight. We didn't have the breakfast as it was very expensive at €29.50, but there are lots of local cafes serving coffee, pastries etc. Also did not visit the spa or pool. 

All of the staff were incredibly helpful, with good suggestions for local restaurants - they also went out of their way to assist when I carelessly left a credit card in one of these restaurants (later retrieved - thank you too to Vinitus restaurant).

Hotel is very well located, within 2 minutes walk of the Passeig de Gracia station which is on the train line in from the airport as well as several subway lines. 

Overall, highly recommended. 

",5,2017,04,25
40,Great small hotel,"Loved their service, great location right around the corner from the most classy shopping street. Very contemporary style big rooms. 

We got in to town in the morning and they got our room ready by 10am very impressive. Young manager went out of his way to help in anyway. ",5,2017,04,25
40,Great location and staff,"The location is one of the best in Barcelona, between two Gaudi buildings.  It is one building in from Passieg de Gracia.  It is close to the train and fine shopping yet it is quiet.  It is a discreet place with no large signs on the outside.  The rooms have thick and fluffy towels and bathrobes.  The staff contributes to the special atmosphere.  Alexandra booked all my museum trips and tours for me.  Albert provided guidance on getting around town and places to eat.  This hotel had a boutique hotel vibe and customer service, missing from some large chains.",4,2017,04,19
40,Elegant Hotel with Outstanding Service,"Alma Barcelona is a beautifully renovated, chic, perfectly located hotel in the heart of the Eixample district a half a block from Passieg de Garcia.  The room was comfortable and spacious and the bathroom had both a tub and shower with great water pressure, not always the case when traveling.  But the true star of this property is the staff who could not have been more accommodating, kind and expert.  From the email soliciting special requests a few days before we arrived, to the welcoming drink at check in to help with dinner reservations, I could go on and on.  We are grateful for their kindness and would return in a heartbeat.",5,2017,04,18
40,A Great Hotel Centrally Located in a Great City,We had a wonderful experience here starting with an extremely helpful staff all of whom could not do enough for the guests. The hotel itself is elegant and luxurious in a perfectly understated way. We loved the vibe and the furnishings. We had dinner there one night and it was excellent. The surprisingly large courtyard in the back is a peaceful respite in a busy city. The location one block from La Pedrera and a few blocks from Casa Batllo and next to the main shopping street is perfect. I will definitely go back to this hotel on my next visit to Barcelona and highly recommend it. ,5,2017,04,14
40,What a magnificent garden,"We went to Alma on
A beautiful afternoon to have some cerveza and tea 
This is a fantastic garden
Very Japanese style
Calm , relaxing , zen and ideal for the kids who run around and play around 
A little peace of heaven in the city 
",5,2017,04,11
40,Best hotel experience ever.,"The hotel and the staff are so welcoming that you feel like at home, with a 5 star treatment. 

Walk into the garden and you will literally forget being in one of the most popular and crowded cities in Spain. 

Perfectly located. I held all my business meetings in the lobby, and enjoy relaxation with the Spa and the terrace and never felt the need to leave the hotel, even with all the beautiful places the concierge was recommending.

If you have the opportunity to stop by, even just to try their delicious restaurant for breakfast or lunch, this is a must do in Barcelona.",5,2017,04,09
40,"Quiet, Elegant, Understated","We had a great experience here. The hotel is gorgeous and quiet with a very central location for exploring Barcelona's unique neighborhoods. The staff speaks English extremely well, which was helpful to us.  We would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,04,06
40,Perfect Place to Explore Barcelona ,"I have just returned from the Alma and it was brilliant. My 8 year old daughter is studying Spanish at school and so we decided to go and practice our Spanish. 

Although this is not a children's hotel,  from the moment we arrived they made us feel incredibly welcome - the staff are first class, knowledgeable and always on hand to help.

The room was large, clean and modern. There is a mini-bar with complimentary drinks. Our room over-looked the garden bar. It felt quiet and tranquil despite being moments away from the hustle and bustle of the city. 

Breakfasts were delicious - with excellent choices, a varied buffet and attentive staff. 

I am going to return soon with my wife and now wouldn't stay anywhere else. 

",5,2017,04,06
40,Chic and luxurious hotel in fabulous location,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend in March. It is very stylish, unassuming from the outside but seriously chic inside. We were greeted by the reception staff who couldn't do enough to accommodate us. Our room was minimalist but elegant with the usual 5 star touches like robes and slippers and luxury toiletries. The bed was fabulous and massive however it felt a bit weird having separate duvets on the same bed, we couldn't quite get used to it. The shower pressure is the only thing that could have been improved, it wasn't the best. Also we did order room service where we asked for virgin cocktail but ended with a very much alcohol filled one (we weren't charged for this). We had dinner one night in the restaurant and the food was sparse but tasty. The breakfast however was in a completely different league. I'd stay here again just for that, do NOT miss it if you stay here. We also visited the spa area which was small but perfectly formed. The location of the hotel is great, we visited Sagrada Familia on foot (about 20 mins away), amazing shopping (high end, think Louis Vuitton and Chanel) is on your doorstep and the bus tours stop nearby too. Overall a real gem of a hotel if you feel like a treat. We'll be back.",5,2017,04,01
40,Beach & Football Weekend,"Cosy Hotel with a perfect atmosphere and a nice air refresher parfum. Special fingerprint logins to your room. The fingerprint works as well with the spa. Very cosy spa, but we missed the rooftop bar and pool.",5,2017,03,30
40,"Fabulous Hotel in the ""RIGHT"" part of town","My husband and I stayed at the Alma for a weekend get-away. The service was impeccable. The cozy check in area is adorned with a stately desk and couch, so you feel like you are chatting with a friend, and not checking in to a hotel. They served us wine, issued us VIP (no waiting in line) tickets to the attraction we were interested in seeing (The Guadi houses and such) and then gave us the necessary information concerning the hotels' spa and gym. We booked a junior suite. The room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. The bed was fabulous! Each person was given three pillows, a robe, slippers and incredibly plush towels. Breakfast was good, but not extraordinary. For the price, I believe, we could have found something better. But it was convenient and there was nothing wrong with it... just not anything special.",5,2017,03,26
40,Stylish modern hotel in Barcelona,"Stylish modern hotel designed by Stark
Minimalist stylish room, grand atrium facility
Very practical finger print door opening system which allows fast check in (go directly to room) in case of repeat stays
Enjoyable interior garden
one disappointment: roof top bar and terrace not opened in winter ? what winter in Barcelona, it was 19 C ...!!",5,2017,03,24
40,A very relaxing stay - excellent staff,"Fantastic contemporary luxury hotel in a very desirable area of Barcelona.  Rooms are very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Amazing shower complimented by lovely products.  Soft drinks and beer in the fridge for use throughout the stay.  Fresh linen every day.  Staff are attentive, respectful and very efficient.  Our room had doors onto a lovely garden at the back of the hotel.",5,2017,03,22
40,"Lovely contemporary hotel in a great location, very helpful and knowledgeable concierge with great recommendations.","This is a great place to stay. Right off the main shopping area (similar to 5th Avenue NY) with lots of local tapas, bars and bakeries for breakfast nearby. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and nothing was too much trouble.",4,2017,03,21
40,Lovely,"First time in Barcelona and we were  so pleased to have found the Alma. I booked online and was not disappointed upon arrival. Hotel is comfortable and has a cozy feel. Staff were so friendly and inviting. The room had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Nice outdoor patio to have a drink downstairs. The steam room, sauna and gym made it perfect. I have no complaints at all. If we return to Barcelona in the future we will be staying here again. Also, they had great coffee! Always a plus ;) Just lovely.
",5,2017,03,18
40,perfect service,"Our first contact with Barcelone was through the Alma hotel : a warm welcome at the desk with a glass of cold water, then smiles everywhere and hands pour help you to carry your heavy suitcase. A perfect room with a fridge with free drinks, with a view on the garden. It was very quiet even with the open windows.
Very healthy breakfast with all what you wish, worth the price. 
The restaurant with  spanish meals with french touch  is excellent. All around you have the main places of interest and you can go on foot or take the bus near by.",5,2017,03,18
40,A nice boutique hotel at a great location,"I was traveling in Barcelona in November 2016 and stayed at 3 hotels in the city. Alma was one of them and I would like to give this hotel a compliment for its great location, facilities and services.  It is just 1 min walking distance to Passieg de Garcia, the most happening street in the city with lots shops, restaurants, and tourist points. Casa Mila is in 5 min walking distance and Casa Batllo maybe 7 min.  Compared with the luxury hotels in the Passieg de Garcia, Alma locates in a small lane which makes it more quiet and private than those on the main street.  The decoration of Alma is more like a design hotel with dark color tones which I believe will be more attracted to young and trendy guests.  I didn't try the restaurant at the lobby level but it was connected to a backyard which was very comfortable to have a sit and drink while the weather was good.
There was a spa at the basement level where you can enjoy the sauna and jacuzzi and have a cup of tea. It seemed not very crowded while I visited there so only I myself in the spa area, which was very good so that I can enjoy the quiet and relaxing time.
I was staying at the junior suite and it was quite large and comfortable in the room. I would recommend those travelers who don't like crowded guests in the luxury hotels to try the accommodation at Alma when visiting Barcelona and you will be able to experience a very relaxed trip there. ",5,2017,03,16
40,First Class,"So very attentive service;excellent location;nothing forgotten. We were in room 611 on the back quiet side. We rate hotels by their towels and were amazing..sounds a bit silly but it works.
 Only problem we had was the front interior stairs to the lobby from reception are poorly lit  and my wife tripped.",5,2017,03,15
40,Stay here!!!,"A sophisticated, beautiful and comfortable hotel which is very well located.  We had a suite and a regular room as we were 4 people.  Both were well-appointed though our suite was really elegant.  The pillows and bedding are luscious!  We had drinks in the garden after a long day of walking the city---a great spot to relax.  Highly recommended!! ",5,2017,03,13
40,The best location ever!,"Very good location, close to the most important attractions. in3 minutes walk to Cash Mila, 5 minutes walk to Cash Batllo, 12 minutes walk to Sagrada Familia. 
Rooms are clean, nicely decorated and modern. 
Staffs are very behaved. 
The only thing is they don't have;
specific staff for Conciage.
Recommend ",5,2017,03,13
40,A very comfortable base for your activities in Barcelona,"Already at the check-in very professional and help with getting a ticket for Sagrada Familia - just some 15-20 min from the hotel. 
A lovely bar area with Tapas at your fingertips!
Located just off Pasteig de Gracia it is well suited for your shopping experience.
In short, an excellent place that made my stay in Barcelona even more relaxing.",5,2017,03,11
40,Excellent urban boutique hotel,"The Alma is a truly excellent find in Barcelona which is not short of decent hotels.  It is well located and the hotel itself is a fantastic mix of upmarket chic yet very friendly and welcoming from the outset.  In fact the service is phenomenal.  This is the only hotel i have ever been too where at check in they read me perfectly and said ""You look thirsty, can we offer you a cold beer?""  Magic.  The rooms are large with high ceilings and are extremely comfortable.  Spa was very nice too.  I will definitely return.  Great hotel.",5,2017,03,05
40,"Excellent Upscale Hotel in Safe, Convenient Location With Rooftop Bar","We really loved this hotel. They were very nice at Check-in, when we were so exhausted from our transatlantic trip. Almost every staffer was nice. (Just maybe two cranky ones, both guys, during the whole stay.) Room was lovely. Restaurant was good. Rooftop Bar is a destination in itself--INCREDIBLE. A little hard to get drinks we wanted, but no biggies. Fantastic snack mix accompanied drinks. Nice touch: umbrellas for our trip out when it was pouring rain. Very modern decor--not completely my thing but it was well done & it grew on me as part of the fun. Finally, we like to walk around so we want something safe & convenient. This is more important in Barcelona, because (1) you eat dinner late in Spain, and (2) petty crime, pickpocketing, mugging, is endemic. (I was very careful and all went well--I learned my lesson in Madrid.) So this hotel is great because it's in a very nice, SAFE, AND convenient area: the upscale Eixample neighborhood. Las Ramblas is a little too much for us with all the pickpockets--same near the Sagrada Familia. The Raval is very dicey, and I wouldn't feel comfortable at night in the Barrio Gotico (The Gothic Quarter), although it's neat during the day. There are other safe neighborhoods but they don't seem too convenient.  You really need a place in Barcelona where you can relax at night. You want a room safe for your valuables. And when the craziness becomes too much, how wonderful to have a destination rooftop bar with view of a Gaudi building & the famous night-lit fountains an elevator ride away. Have a few drinks--relax--go to your room. You DO NOT want to be walking around Barcelona at night tipsy.  I don't want to scare you off--Barcelona is WONDERFUL, and apparently violent crime is low--but read the travel sites. It's no fun to have your passport, credit cards, rings, necklaces, or money stolen.  So be aware of your surroundings and backpack/purse/wallet every second. Also read up to learn the scams, like the bird poop, the thrown baby, the swarm, the escalator, the impromptu football game, the flat tire, the dropped/broken cell phone, etc., and you'll be fine. Staying at the Hotel Alma will make your stay better and safer.",5,2017,03,01
40,Fantastic Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"We stayed at the Alma a few weeks ago while passing through Barcelona for a couple of nights. Great hotel! The people are friendly, the service is amazing and the rooms are quite nice. The hotel is located in the heart of the city in a quite neighborhood that is walking distance to the Rambla and the Gothic Quarter, but far enough to escape the craziness if you so desire. Breakfast is quite good, but the real gem is the large outdoor garden where you can enjoy the outdoors in a peaceful setting. All in all a fantastic hotel...",5,2017,03,01
40,Excellent Service,"I was in Barcelona last week on a business trip, and at all times found the employees of the Alma Barcelona to be extremely courteous and helpful. The hotel itself is elegant and the rooms are comfortable. As I was leaving Barcelona, I unfortunately left my mobile phone inside of the taxi that took me to the airport. After managing to find a pay phone at the airport and calling the Alma Barcelona front desk, a friendly voice told me not to worry, and that they would find my phone and have it sent to my home in America. Sure enough, 2 days later it was delivered to my home. That's a level of service that is beyond what I would have hoped for. Thank you Alma Barcelona!",5,2017,02,23
40,Memories in 2013,"I visited this hotel in 2013 summer and it was really a good experience.

On the roof, I still remember u can go there and have a drink or something just chill there. And the hotel is well connected to the metro and center. There are some good restaurants nearby.

Highly recommended!",4,2017,02,21
40,Excellent stay,"The welcome started as our taxi arrived, a friendly smile & a helpful service. Upon checking in, personal service was evidently part of the culture. The room was well appointed, every detail taken care of & staff were very friendly. The room over looked a beautiful garden, clean & bed was very comfortable. The bar staff were attentive & service with a smile. All very welcoming after long days travelling. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,02,19
40,"Warm, Classy and Unique","I spent two nights over the weekend as part of a business trip. The hotel is stylish and warm, the service was amazing. The staff was helpful and intelligent, able to assist in any way and answer any question I had. The hotel is located in a quiet street, a walking distance from the city's high end shops. The only cons might be the location which is a little far away from the tourists attractions (Gothic quarter..), the lightning was very weak as part of the interior design, I thought that it was a little depressing. Overall a great place with a unique atmosphere",5,2017,02,18
40,Very good choice! ,"Modern, extremely well kept, very good service. Nice breakfast. Amazing view . Sits on the lake . The rooms are good , if you can upgrade a bit it's worthwhile , cause there is a big difference size wise.
The bathrooms are not as nice as the room but still very much ok .
",5,2017,02,15
40,Brilliant hotel in a buzzing city,The buzz and excitement of our family trip to Barcelona was further amplified by the outstanding customer service and friendliness of the front desk staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The quality of the  rooms and service is also par excellence  - I would recommend the hotel to anybody looking for a well located hotel for discerning travellers.,5,2017,02,14
40,Stay here when in Barcelona!,"This hotel is excellent.  The detail of the design inside was well received by both me and my wife, who is an interior designer/architect.

40,"Good location, higher end , not too touritsty","Well appointed , professional staff and modern decor.  Surrounded by restaurants and shopping districts. 20-30 min walk to las ramblas area. No pool, but  nice garden area for warmer times. More oriented for adults.",4,2017,02,13
40,Weekend away,"We spent from Friday to Sunday at The Alma & although not spending too much time at the hotel, what time we did spend there was great. Staff were pleasant, facilities were good & the champagne waiting for our return on the first night was a nice touch. ",5,2017,02,12
40,still the best,"This was my fourth or fifth stay here and it remains one of my favourite hotels. The reception is charming, the decor modern, the breakfast delicious, and the rooms are just right - beautiful bathrooms, the rooms a little minimalist, just so. Beds very comfortable. Highly recommended.",5,2017,02,10
40,Great Experience,"This is a really fantastic hotel.  Everyone on staff was exceptionally helpful and very kind.  During our visit my wife was ill and a number of folks on staff went out of their way to regularly provide tea, lemon, and honey.  The room was quiet and spacious. We've stayed at four different hotels in Barcelona over the last year and this is ""by far"" the best one. Another big plus for this hotel is the location.  Central for shopping and restaurants.",5,2017,02,07
40,Great location,"This hotel is perfectly placed to see the city sights.  It's a lovely hotel, with great rooms and a good bar/restaurant.  And the staff are really helpful and went out of their way to make sure we had a good trip. ",4,2017,02,05
40,Gorgeous hotel in a great location,"I stayed at Alma Barcelona while doing an event in the city recently. It was an absolutely stunning place. The ""spa"" on the lower level is a great place to recharge and has a pool that is just about long enough for a short swim. But the spa is just the start of your restful and pleasurable experience here. The rooms are like small studio apartments with beautiful wood floors and nice furnishings - leather chairs, french windows and a small desk. The bathroom was spacious and luxurious. In addition to the comfortable rooms, breakfast was delicious and everyone who worked at the hotel was friendly and helpful. Alma is right near the main shopping areas and a short 20 minute walk to MACBA and the ramblas. If I can afford to, I will stay here again!!",5,2017,02,04
40,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed he for a long weekend and it was a great five star hotel. The room was lovely and clean and a good size. The reception staff were outstanding, always polite and more than willing to help. The Hotel is in an amazing Location just off Playa De Gracia which is one of the main shopping streets in Barcelona and close to two stations on the Metro so getting around was very easy. The Spa are was nice not exceptional but very nice . My only complaint was the prices in the bar and restaurant and we ended up drinking and eating out all the time.",5,2017,02,02
40,Chic and well designed hotel in the heart of the shopping district,"Great property with an excellent location just off Passeg de Garcia and close to a Metro stop. The hop on/off bus tour stop is also just a block away at Casa Mila.

The service was top notch and everything was well taken care off. A great smooth check-in and they helped us with dinner recommendations and booking of attraction tickets. 

This hotel is also technologically advanced, they use fingerprint sensors instead of keyboards that up the cool factor of this hotel by a notch. Big luxurious bathrooms and rooms are great with the added bonus of a complimentary minibar.

 The only downside was that they have very flat and soft pillows, we had to ask for many additional just to get it just right for us! Also for a 5 star hotel, it was very odd they didn't have coffee/tea making facilities in the room (Management - do look into that please)

A great stay all in all and highly recommended.",5,2017,01,15
40,"Great Service, Perfect Location, Amazing Rooms...","... which comes with a price tag which is worth every cent! 

The rooms are well designed. Very modern and chic. Best of all, it is spacious. 
There is a toilet (with literally just a toilet), and a bathroom with 2 rain shower and a sink. There was a door for the toilet but for the bathroom, it is an open concept. There is no door between the bathroom and the bedroom. There is also no shower curtain or door to keep water from splashing out (that was probably the only downside but it was minor). 

There was a minibar and it was well stocked. Everything in the fridge is free... and refillable! A very pleasant surprise. 

Location wise, this place is perfect as it is close to many Gaudi buildings including Sagrada. Plus, the hop on hop off bus stops nearby.. and is easily accessible by train. 

Service was very good. I also felt very safe staying in the hotel. 

Highly recommend the hotel.",5,2017,01,03
40,Excellent!,"Beautiful hotel. Great location, right by Passeig de Gracia and a few minutes walk from Plaça de Catalunia. Very chic and clean hotel. Service is simply impeccable, from check in to check out. Staff is very friendly every single time. Highly recommend staying there!",5,2017,01,01
40,Very clean and chic,"The room and bedding are very clean and the interior is a good design, with separate toilet and shower in our premium room. Central location within 5 mins of a metro station and La Pedrera. Excellent service.",5,2016,12,22
40,Nearly perfect,"I stayed here on a short break recently. The whole experience was very good, from the very friendly and smooth check-in to the cool style of the hotel. I loved the decor, and the bed was very comfortable although I found the pillows to be too soft, as has been mentioned by another reviewer. A firmer pillow was provided when I asked, but it was too hard, so I made do with the soft ones because I didn't want to sound like Goldilocks....maybe the feather pillows just need replacing?
The only other (minor) problem with the room was the very poor quality hairdryer, which was surprising when everything else was top of the range, and a lack of mirrors in the room. I stayed in a Grand Deluxe room and the only mirror was in the bathroom, approx 2 metres away from the plug for the hairdryer. This made it difficult to see while drying my hair, which was a shame when everything else about the room was very well thought out.",4,2016,12,18
40,Service at this hotel is simply excellent - one big smile all the time,"Have just spend 3 days at this hotel during a business trip. From arrival to leaving the hotel, the service was constanctly perfect. When you check in, you are sitting down and can have cold drink/coffee/tea served:). The employees are very helpful, kind and smiling - its really outstanding. The employee at the breakfast serving was so kind and serviceminded that it was impressive. The breakfast is really delicious, a lot of local dishes. They make a great omelette! The room was great. You have to be aware that it's with an open shower to the room, didn't bother me. Many TV channels to choice from. Nice garden behind the hotel where you can enjoy coffee/drinks etc. Location is very central. Be aware that fitness room is extremely small, so is the swimming pool.",5,2016,12,16
40,Wonderful hotel,"Really lovely hotel, amazing service, comfortable and well equipped rooms. Having travelled a fair bit and stayed in plenty of hotels, I can safely say that I have stayed in few that are as well considered as this one. Comfortable and stylish are the two words that spring to mind.",5,2016,12,15
40,Fantastic hotel and service,We stayed Alma for my partners 40th Birthday staying in one of the executive suites (313). From the moment we checked in we were made to feel welcome. Having never visited Barcelona we were given fantastic recommendations for eating drinking and sightseeing. It is a special city and this hotel made it even more memorable.,5,2016,12,12
40,Modern luxury located near best shopping/tourist attractions,"We stayed at the Alma for two nights the first week of December and had the most relaxing stay. Dark and modern lobby/hallways with a gorgeous outdoor garden area to lounge (space heaters included). Fingerprint access to rooms and pool area which was very convenient. The rooms are modern, with wooden details, wet room shower and large tub. Ample wardrobe space and a comfy lounge chair. Black out sliding doors to cover the windows and complimentary (free) mini bar (water, juices, coke, and beer). 

You have the option to enjoy breakfast (25 euros/each) downstairs in the restaurant, or brought to your room. However, the hotel is situated right on the corner of Paseig de Gracia so there are plenty of places to seek out meals, which we did. The Paseig is a serious shoppers paradise so the Alma was conveniently located. There were two Metro stations five minutes in either direction, Placa Catalunya 10 minutes walk away, and teo of Gaudi's impressive buildings 3-5 minutes walk away. 

The only suggestions we would make is to have instructions on how to use the showers (as they were a bit complicated to get going), and to invest in firm pillows for guests to switch out (as the 2 pillows on the bed were abnormally soft).

Our favourite part of the Alma was the indoor pool, steam room, sauna, gym, and spa services. I had an hour massage and it was absolutely amazing, but will set you back 90 euros. Communication by the hotel was great, and when we arrived very early on Monday morning to drop our bags off they let us check in at 9:30am.

Overall, we felt we truly experienced the full 5 stars the Alma is rated, and will definitely book here again the next time we treat ourselves to a Barcelona city break!",5,2016,12,08
40,Great hotel and location,"Alma is really well located in Barcelona. The hotel is modern, sleek and very well appointed. Excellent breakfast (not included). Very friendly and professional staff. Big rooms and bathrooms. Surprised it is not more highly ranked!",5,2016,12,04
40,Perfect location and superior front-desk service,"We have been business and vacation travelers for over 30 years and recognize exceptional properties.  This is really a 5-star property. Excellent location right in the middle of the Gaudi section, walking distance to many of the Gaudi sites, local restaurants and cafes.. Upgraded to a larger room when we arrived, The sleeping rooms are lovely and beautifully decorated. The front desk service is outstanding. The staff was so knowledgeable about all situations: restaurants, sites, transportation. They all went the extra step to find answers to questions they did not know. The bar is lovely for afternoon tea and drinks. Again. very helpful staff. The pool and exercise center wonderful and appreciated since we are serious swimmers.",5,2016,11,29
40,"Fabulous hotel, luxurious service","We stayed at the Alma for four nights last week and we absolutely loved it. The staff are extremely attentive, helpful, and have excellent recommendations for local things to do - especially restaurants. The rooms themselves are stylish and minimalist, but with very comfortable beds and a nice lounge chair. We had a room facing the courtyard because we wanted a quiet room. The rooms are well designed, with an interior entryway to add sound blocking from the hallway, and sliding wooden panels on the windows. The bar is great and the garden is lovely. I can't say enough about how much we loved this place. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. The neighborhood was fine - convenient to lots of places and away from the craziness of the Ramblas or other areas, but a bit of a stuffy neighborhood. It worked for us though because we didn't want to be in the middle of a scene...and we were able to walk pretty much everywhere from there. Highly highly recommend!",5,2016,11,28
40,"Great location, Great hotel","Location is perfect- beautiful part of the city, close to everything.  Staff was incredibly helpful, making dinner reservations, calling cabs, booking tickets.  Rooms were large and comfortable.  Breakfast buffet and room service were very good.  Pool is shallow, more to relax in then to swim but my 11 year old still loved going every day.  Would recommend 100%",5,2016,11,27
40,Weekend,We spent i weekend in Barcelona and stated at Alma hotel. Great hotel with perfect service and good location in center of BC. Quiet and stylish. Breakfast is expensive but there are cafes and bakeries just around the corner. When visiting Barcelona this hotel is a very good choice.,5,2016,11,27
40,Loved it,"Alma is a great hotel.  It was comfortable, convenient, the staff was amazing and helpful.
The hotel is within a 15 minute walk of Sagrada Familia and Las Ramblas.  Enjoy the bar or restaurant at the hotel or at a nearby cafe!  I would stay again in a heartbeat!",5,2016,11,24
40,Great Location,"Perfectly located. Is a great hotel to get around, subway close by and easy access to all tourist attractions if that's what you're looking for. Terrace with a wonderful views but expensive drinks. Very helpful and kind staff.",5,2016,11,21
40,Great!,"Stayed here whilst in a weekend break to Barcelona. The hotel is in a great location, and the accommodation is fantastic. Service was excellent across the board. Food was also first rate. Would recommend the hotel and look forward to staying again. ",5,2016,11,21
40,"Very nice, but dark","This is a very nice hotel.  It’s in an excellent location within easy walking distance of many destinations, and close to bus (city and Hop-on-hop-off) and Metro.  Staff was very accommodating and spoke excellent English.  The hotel is beautifully modern, but dark.  The lobby is dark; the stairs leading from the street level to the upper lobby are dark (dangerously dark in my opinion, especially when you are coming in from the bright sunlight into the dark lobby).  The elevator is dark (we hit the wrong button several times because we couldn’t see), and the halls are dark.  I had trouble finding our keyhole.  The rooms are also dark, even with all the lights on.  If you are in a room facing the street, you hear a lot of street noise even with the windows and shutters closed; if you are facing the courtyard, it’s very quiet.  The spa area is small, but very nice.",4,2016,11,19
40,Luxury comfort ,"Very luxurious and well appointed, set in the heart of Barcelona. Stunning hotel with excellent staff. It is not cheap but is certainly worth it. Try the spa and gym. Rooms are spacious, especially liked the bottle of Cava bubbly waiting in the room.",5,2016,11,19
40,Trendy boutique hotel with great staff,"We had a large 'executive' room with a wonderful bathroom, nice wood floors, comfortable bed.  Not much wardrobe space and tiny drawers though.
Excellent breakfast but not this was not cheap.
Interesting art in the public area.
Swimming pool allows you to just about do laps, as long as no one else is there!",4,2016,11,17
40,"Great location, great service, very modern","The Alma is in a great location in Barcelona, just off Paseo de Gracia where all the stores are.  It is designed by Phillipe Starck but unlike other properties of his design, this one is warm and inviting as he used a lot of wood.  It is a small hotel but very modern, loved that the doors opened with your fingerprints.

The service is impeccable.  Unlike other hotels, the registration has the guest sit in front of the clerk who can also help the guest with restaurant reservations and purchasing tickets of all sorts.  The staff are very friendly, helpful and courteous. Highly recommend you stay there.",4,2016,11,14
40,"Quiet, Comfortable, Welcoming","My elder daughter and I have spent the week in Barcelona for some well-deserved and needed time off for her and a new city and country for me.  The room looks out on a large shared courtyard for the block but quiet and away from the shopping a block away.  Beds are comfortable, plenty of hot water, extensive storage.  Staff is all smiles and helpful.  Restaurant was very good.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,11,11
40,A tale of two rooms,"The hotel is in a good location and its inclusion in TripAdvisor's list of the quietest hotels in Barcelona sealed the deal for me. We splurged and reserved a junior suite. When we checked in I asked for a room away from traffic and was told that (1) all of the junior suites face the street; (2) there were no other types of room available that night; and (3) the soundproofing was excellent. 

The room was large and well appointed but very dark (as were the common areas in the hotel) and VERY noisy, with motor scooters whizzing by constantly. We were able to move to a  room facing the courtyard on our last night, and while smaller and lacking some amenities, e.g., a bathtub, it was both brighter and blissfully quiet.  The spa is nice, but the room was much too hot, and could use more than two lounge chairs. ",3,2016,11,10
40,A charming boutique hotel,"From the moment of check-in we were impressed with the look of the hotel and friendliness of the staff.
We found the location to be very convenient without being in the hustle and bustle of the more tourist oriented precient of the city.
Drinks in the garden was a very relaxing experience and again attentive but not intrusive service",5,2016,11,07
40,Modern luxury and well run,"Ultra modern, sleek and very clean hotel.  Well located and just a block or two away from Casa Batillo and La Padrera with about a 20 minute walk to Sagrada Familia.  Staff was very helpful and worked some issues for us.  Our friends stayed at an Executive Suite which was terrific.  Our Grand Deluxe room was nice but just one sink and not enough light over vanity.",4,2016,11,05
40,This is my new home in Barcelona,"I picked that hotel on the internet because of what I read on TripAdvisor.
This hotel is so nice, the grey walls, the people working in it, the spa and the pool, the garden....No key to enter the room only your fingerprint is brilliant. 
We stayed 3 nights, enjoyed the afternoon tea in the garden and the breakfast in the morning. 
The breakfast food is great and you have so many choices. We loved the spa because it was so quiet, we even booked massages and it was great. 
May be having a boiler in the room to make tea would be the ice on the cake ?",5,2016,11,04
40,Wonderful location and service,From our initial check in (when we offered cappuccino) though our entire 4 day stay the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are larger then usual for a small boutique hotel in Europe and the beds are very comfortable. The location is excellent for walking and restaurants and there are two famous Gaudi buildings within a few blocks. The only negatives were a very small and low closet to hang up our clothing and the shower. The large shower occupies about a third of the bathroom but there is no door or curtain so water spills out covering the floor.,5,2016,10,30
40,Elegant,Beautifully designed hotel in a great very central location with the added bonus of a gorgeous garden. All the staff were very attentive and helpful. Rooms are spacious and bright with attention to detail .. This is our third stay at the alma and we love it there.,5,2016,10,30
40,Perfection,"My wife and I had the pleasure of a 4 day visit here at The Alma. Attention to detail starts the instant you arrive at the door. We travel frequently, the staff here reminded us what Professionalism and Courtesy in the Hotel game is all about.    5 stars no less.",5,2016,10,29
40,Really nice property,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our holiday in Europe. We were deciding between Casa Fuster and Alma and this definitely suited our tastes more (we're a reasonably young couple with no kids). The design is exceptional.

I always ask for a room with lots of natural light when we check into hotels and on this occasion they gave us a free upgrade in order to accommodate this request. The room was very large and had floor to ceiling windows with an open view. The courtyard was a great place for breakfast and the bar downstairs was the perfect place to meet for a drink before heading out to dinner.

Spectacular spa/pool/gym area too. And the location of the hotel is fantastic (close to all the action/shopping/restaurants, but not on the main road so it's close but not overwhelmed).

Would definitely stay here again when we visit Barcelona.",5,2016,10,26
40,Exceptional comfort,My husband & I visited Barcelona for the first time and were extremely satisfied with our stay at the Alma.  My husband booked a few days at the hotel before our cruise and one day after our cruise. The staff cordially greeted us & graciously offered us refreshments after our arduous flight from Florida. We arrived early in the morning & yet they were able to readily accommodate us in our very cosmopolitan room. The mini bar which was stocked with bottled waters/juices/beer/sodas were free of charge! A phenomenal view of the roof top La Pedrera by Antonia Gaudi. Since we were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary they bestowed us with a bottle of cava to enjoy. Do partake of their wonderful breakfast for an additional 25 euro per person which was well worth the splurge. The hotel is centrally located to all the sites & within walking distance to the on off bus for site seeing.,5,2016,10,26
40,Great Location In Barcelona,"You cannot find a better central location in Barcelona.  The service, including 24/7 front desk is outstanding, the rooms are clean and the restaurant with its location in the outdoor garden is terrific.   The vibe is minimalist-chic.                                       
Things to consider:  The hallways leading to the rooms are dark and the room doesn't offer enough light in the evening.  The fingerprint keypad entry, sounds cool, but did not always work on first try.",4,2016,10,26
40,Great hotel and location,Only negative comment concerns the open concept of the shower.  I think a door would be beneficial rather than water on the entire bathroom floor.  Most sights are within walking distance.  Very friendly and helpful staff. ,5,2016,10,26
40,Wow,"The only reservation we had about this wonderful and centrally located hotel was the unreliable WiFi. Breakfast is a delight; the rooms, spacious and comfortable.  You will LOVE the showers.  Staff were always pleasant and helpful.  The courtyard bar and restaurant were especially lovely.  Try the Steak Tartare.",5,2016,10,25
40,Review of a hidden and quite place: the restaurant at the Alma hotel,"A rainy day, a break from a loud city...where to go?
We went into the Alma Hotel and found a Secret Garden at the bottom, not the place to sit a rainy day but a green picture to enjoy, behind the windows, in a confortable space. 
We met a friend there, and decided to stay for lunch. Perfect decision.
A friendly and discreet service, the dishes were delicious and tasty. Good timing. Very good kitchen. No noise at all. 
Everything for an affordable price. 
We really enjoyed the moment!!!
To consider when in search of a retired place to have a drink, share a tea (and a piece of cake!) with a friend, read a book alone with a coffee, or to have a meal at the restaurant.
Highly recommended!",5,2016,10,25
40,Amazing design hotel in the best location,"I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped in the lobby of Alma. Beautiful design hotel in the Passig de Gracia - the best location in Barcelona. Cava and tea or coffee was offered at check in. Service was efficient and friendly and a changing of room far from elevator was executed with no problem. The room was spacious and I like the open bathroom system with the toilet in a separate area. The shower was big and the sink area has lots of space. And I love the toiletries. Our room faces the pool area and the surrounding buildings are quite far and so there is a nice view with a glimpse of the roof Gaudi building afar. Mini bar is complimentary and complimentary champagne with biscuits delivered to our room was a nice touch. Lots of storage space in the room and I like the long ledge against the wall which can act as a luggage rack and more surface area. The bed is super comfortable and I love the two separate fluffy duvet which is not tucked in the bed. I highly recommend Alma and will no doubt stay there again on my next visit. It surpasses the other hotels (Mandarin Oriental, Casa Fuster, W Barcelona and Hotel Omm) we've stayed in Barcelona. The only negative comment is the dark lighting in the room.",5,2016,10,24
40,Perfect,We stayed a couple of nights before our cruise and couldn't have been more pleased. We were met at the taxi and hand delivered through check in to our room. We were given an upgrade and the room was big and beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and the items in the minifridge were complimentary. Service throughout was exceptional. We highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,10,23
40,"Charming, sophisticated boutique hotel in Central Barcelona","We loved the look and feel of the hotel, from the warm welcome at reception, to the modern and well thought out design/comfort of the room, and the beautiful courtyard where we could sit and relax after a day of touring. Also, I could order a cappuccino and roll for breakfast a la carte without paying the full breakfast price.of 25 Euros. There are various dining options to choose from for dinner, too. I loved the room layout and amenities, but, a bit more lighting in the hallways would be appreciated. The hotel is well-located in Central Barcelona, just a 1/2 block from the Passeig de Gracia and just a few blocks north of the Placa Catalunya. We'd be happy to stay at the Alma again and recommend it highly!

",5,2016,10,22
40,Gloomy and impractical hotel,"We stayed a couple of nights post cruise at the Alma. You can hardly notice it is a hotel from street as the Alma shows a very low profile. This hotel has very nice design and atmosphere. The design is probably intended for the young crowd because the elderly customers, who have the money to pay $500 a night, will probably have to endure many uncomfortable things at the Alma. The darkness of some areas such as rooms, elevators and hallways prevents one from doing and moving as usual.  Unlocking your room door is a hassle because it is not a card key but an old metal key that is difficult to enter the lock as you must do it in a horizontal way and the key tag is heavy and big. Probably because of complaints the Alma offers a digital entry system, which I refused. There is no overhead lighting in the room and it is hard to look for things in your luggage and move around. They only provide a 3 foot tall floor lamp that hardly gives you help. A ridiculous 28""x28"" wheeled desk (have you seen this before?) is good only for breakfast in the room, but not as a desk. You cannot control the temperature of your room because it is controlled at the Reception desk, a big inconvenience specially if you feel cold in the early morning hours. There is only one luggage rack assigned to each room and you cannot get a second one. One small dining chair in our assigned room,  completely out of order in our Grand De Luxe King Room and in a GL hotel. No make up mirror in the bathroom for the ladies. There is a rather sophisticated little red Punkt telephone in the room with no instructions as to how it works and how to get to the different hotel departments. Bedding is sort of a sleeping bag, with no cover sheet and the down pillows you practically drown on them. We requested firmer pillows and they brought us more of the same. On the positive side, service was fairly good but some unseasoned personnel was noticed. Some personnel showed pretend smiles, some with sincere smiles and attitude, like a Greek young man named Andreas who was very attentive and helpful during our stay.  Room was adequately ample. The restaurant had good quality food and service for breakfast and dinner. Bar area very comfy with good service. You could have a drink in the gardens, well kept and pleasant. The room bathroom was excellent in its layout, components and its lighting.

We felt rather insecure and very cautious walking around the Alma, their stairs to the lobby, their elevators, hallways and room, because of their dark atmosphere design although we felt the design was nicely done, only impractical for us. At our age we don't want to take more risks than those we have to. We felt the first day that we would not be returning to the Alma again.",2,2016,10,18
40,One of the best hotels we have EVER stayed at!,"From the moment our tax pulled up the hotel, the front door men at the hotel came to open our taxi door, and take our luggage inside the hotel for us. We were greeted inside by a staff member at the entrance who walked us to the lobby area to wait for check in. We were given tea, on a tray with mini biscuits (so good) while we waited. We waited less then 5 minutes still we were taking to the guest check in area. The lady was so friendly, the check in process didn't take long at all, she even gave us an upgrade to a suite with a garden view. She gave us a map of Barcelona, she showed and circled all the main tourist spots, streets. She even went as far as googling all the vegetarian restaurants in the area. From then our bags were brought up to the room for us, we were escorted to the elevator door and gave us directions to our room. The coolest thing about the hotel was the fingerprint access to get into our room, no need for a card! The hotel was really well decorated, and looks like it recently went through a reno. The room was really clean, spacious, the room service did a great job everyday. Our room was sooo quiet, it felt like we were the only couple in the hotel. It poured one night we were staying at the hotel, they had umbrellas for us to use. Upon check out they call and reserved a taxi for us for the next morning. We never tried the restaurant at the hotel but it looked really nice. The garden was also really nice to see from our room but the weather wasn't the greatest to spend time at it. We highly recommend this hotel, we would def stay again. The location is AMAZING right by all the shopping!!",5,2016,10,18
40,One night,"Very nice hotel.  Outstanding shower, linens and bath towels.  Very nice king bed.  Very contemporary and lovely but a little lacking in brightness and color.  Had hard time getting key in door due to lack of lighting in hall.  They did have a really cool fingerprint entry option that we did not use.  Should have!",5,2016,10,17
40,Garden paradise in a large city,"We loved our stay at the Alma Hotel in Barcelona. We spent 3nights there at the end of our 3 week stay in Spain and it was our second stay in Barcelona. The hotel is beautifully designed in muted colours but the real bonus is the gorgeous garden at the back of the hotel which offers a sushi bar at the end of it. We were welcomed at the curb by a very help young man who took care of our luggage and from then to the end of our stay the staff at every level were professional,helpful,courteous  and friendly. We took advantage of the hotel spa and pool. My husband generally swims 3klm's a day and it certainly wasn't fit for that but I enjoyed relaxing there .The massage was very nice and there was a good range of services.
The linen was beautiful and I took a photo of the pillow product name and purchased some once I arrived home.
Our return visit to Barcelona was primarily for shopping and The Alma is perfectly situated right across from Louis Vuitton although the reception staff also recommend a area for local designers which we thought were fantastic and it was nice to take home local product. 
Booking breakfast at the hotel is a must if you want to eat before 9am as nothing around is open. We didn't eat any other meals at the hotel but did enjoy the roof top bar. THE COCKTAILS ARE A MUST. I believe they have a won more than one award!
We loved our stay and look forward to returning with our daughters.",5,2016,10,11
40,My stay at Alma Hotel Barcelona,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel as everything is perfect
Location & the overall services
The staff is very friendly and professional
the breakfast is very rich , tasty  and you can feel the freshness all over the place
the quality of free WIFI is so good
I will sure come back there next time",5,2016,10,07
40,Best Hotel EVER!!!,"The Alma Barcelona is the very best hotel in this beautiful city. Everything is top notch: location, service, the room, the breakfast, drinks, etc. We've stayed in other higher ranked hotels in Barcelona and they cannot compare to the Alma. Don't waste your time reading reviews, just book at the Alma. ",5,2016,10,04
40,Fantastic hotel in a great location,We stayed in 2 deluxe rooms and they were very spacious with a separate bath and shower with windows that opened. The staff at this hotel were impeccable. The location of the hotel was great too and we felt totally safe walking around this area during the day and at night. There were plenty of places to eat and drink nearby and most sights were within walking distance. A great stay.,5,2016,09,30
40,Really nice hotel,"We stayed for three nights in a ""grand deluxe"" room at the Hotel Alma - it was a friendly, comfortable and modern hotel near many attractions and cafes. We could walk to Sagrada Familia and other Gaudi sites.The rooftop bar was a plus with a great view at night and wonderful cocktails. Highly recommended!",5,2016,09,29
40,Beautiful Hotel!!!,"Beautiful Hotel, the design is Amazing, the rooms very spacious and clean, the staff very professional and attentive at all times, the location is perfect just short distance to the main tourist attractions, and the Restaurant had exquisite food!",5,2016,09,28
40,Unfortunately just one night!,"Splendid hotel a short distance from the main tourist city centre but walkable. Receptionist was very helpful in explanations and suggestions for lunch and where to go and also where not to. 

Nice shady garden for drinks and we tried the sushi there too. Great view from the roof top cocktail bar and fireworks in the distance to boot. We got a room upgrade which was nice, the room was very spacious, cool wood floors, great air con and a huge shower. Plenty of wardrobe space, a safe with mini bar included in the price. I didn't get to the pool unfortunately but I did have a lovely Spanish omelette for breakfast.

Must come back for a city break rather than just an overnight awaiting a cruise ship.",5,2016,09,25
40,Wonderful Experience in Barcelona,"This is the place to stay in Barcelona.  The staff is very professional, knowledgable,  and friendly.  The room was extremely clean and comfortable -- a welcome place to come back to after a busy day.  The location is central to all sightseeing and close to a metro station which conveniently took us all the way back to the airport terminal we needed (for about 5.50 Euro a person) in about 55 minutes.  I would certainly stay at the Alma again if I return to Barcelona -- and I certainly do hope to return to this wonderful city.",5,2016,09,24
40,An oasis - one fabulous hotel,"This hotel is an oasis. I cannot recommend it enough. From the incredible service to the stylish and comfortable public spaces, the gorgeous garden and the spacious, airy and spotless rooms, this is a place I could not wait to return to each day. I especially loved the french door windows that opened out over the garden, the absolute quiet when they were closed, the wonderful rain shower, the minibar amenities (complimentary of course),  the big towels, ultra-comfy bed and the warm lap pool in the spa downstairs.  These and other thoughtful touches make for a perfect stay.",5,2016,09,20
40,"So amazing, I could live there....","I absolutely love this hotel located in downtown Barcelona. It's close to everything and has a roof top bar that has a fabulous view.  The décor is very elegant and contemporary which I love. Spotless, great customer service, yummy food.  I can't say enough about this hotel -- Love, love, love it.",5,2016,09,18
40,LOVE!,What a surprise this hotel was! We stayed here a couple days before a cruise and the hotel was spotless and the staff was so friendly! I highly recommend staying here! The hotel was located within walking distance to the higher end retail stores and to La Segrada House! Hands down the most comfortable bedding. We took a taxi to the cruise port from the hotel and it was under $20 euros. LOVED this hotel!,5,2016,09,13
40,3 night break ,"I travelled to Barcelona with my partner for her birthday on a 3 night break in August. I always trip advisor my hotels before I go anywhere and the Alma Hotel certainly lived up to it's reviews. 

The staff are extremely attentive and always happy to help. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern and have a superb bath and shower. We stayed in the superior room. I didn't see the others to be able to offer a comparison, however I'm sure they are all wonderful. The bedding and pillows were out of this world so having a fab night's sleep was easy. 

We opted not to have the breakfast because we love to explore the city and wanted to find somewhere different every day. The breakfast option also worked out fairly expensive and I'm always a bit wary about committing to everyday in case we are not enamoured. That said the whole set up looked great. 

We were out nearly all the time but returned one evening to see what the rooftop bar was like and it did not disappoint. Spectacular views and a brilliant drinks selection. Be prepared to rack up your room bill though. Again testament to the staff they were very polite and attentive. 

The location is spot on. We did a lot of walking and everything was easily accessible. If you are looking for a modern luxury hotel in a fantastic location then this is the one to pick. Okay so it's not cheap but you absolutely get what you pay for.

If you're thinking should we go to Barcelona the answer is yes! It's a beautiful city with loads to see and do. Get a guide book and look for all the easily missed places in the side streets. Speakeasy type bars etc. ",5,2016,09,11
40,Understated Elegance ,"In a great position - we could see one of the chimneys of La Pedrera from our room - this hotel exudes quiet luxury. The staff are unfailingly helpful and immaculately groomed. The rooms are simply but beautifully furnished with high quality modern furniture. Having a shady garden in which to relax and escape the noise of the city was the icing on the cake. We met friends at the bar of the Melia hotel at the convention centre and that made us realise that the Alma is good value for what it offers!

Tapas in the garden may not have been the most original or the cheapest but it was the perfect setting for a family catch up. Barcelona in summer can be hot and tiring and the Alma is the perfect place to recuperate. 

",5,2016,09,08
40,Great hotel and staff,Stayed at the Alma for three nights and have nothing to complain about and will return as I found the staff helpful and inviting.  The rooms were comfortable and well maintained.  Great location and easy to get around.  Slept in a quiet and comfortable room that was spacious and roomy.  Loved the terrace for a cocktail with views of the city.  Didn't have any meals there but there dining area was attractive.  Will return!,5,2016,09,07
40,Great modern Hotel - Awesome location !,"We recently stayed at the Alma Hotel. Loved it ! Reception was very welcoming and efficient . The hotel is very modern and beautiful. Our room was very spacious and overlooked the beautiful outdoor garden / dining patio.
The location is perfect ! Right around the corner is Barcelona""s premier high end shopping street. We were able to walk to La Rambla and La Sagria Familia from the hotel within 15-20 minutes.
Busy safe city with so much to see and do. The Alma is a perfect spot to stay when visiting Barcelona !!

40,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed for 2 nights pre cruise. Very friendly welcome from reception staff who were exceptionally efficient and helpful. 
Nice sized modern room on 5th floor facing street ( moderate city noise ). Well serviced room with good shower. 
Nice bar and lounge with a lovely quiet courtyard, sushi available in the evening which was excellent quality and value. 
Hotel is very central and easy to reach by train from airport. 
All told good hotel but a little bit expensive if you have a budget. ",4,2016,09,05
40,Wonderful bed; cold unwelcoming reception,"Just checked in the hotel tonight. First impression: great neighbourhood & trendy design. Gentlemen at the door were very nice & welcoming, however the receptionist who checked us in? Not so much. Not that he was rude or anything, just cold, robotic & routine-ish. Their sleek & chic decor at the reception is fine but together with the cold, impersonal manner of the receptionist, I felt like I was at a bank applying a loan. Having lived for almost half a century & have stayed at many 5-stars-or-above hotels in my life. Never before that I feel such great importance in a warm, friendly welcome at the time of check-in, which I got at the Gran Domine Hotel Bilbao but unfortunately not at this hotel. The experience was perhaps just a bit unpleasant but then again enough to compel me to write this review on the first of my four nights at this hotel.

That being said, the bed, pillows, quilt and bed sheets (must be of quite high thread counts) here are so so soft & comfortable which made me slightly happier about my choice of staying here. Hope the remaining of my stay will be better. Will share more about this hotel later...

",3,2016,09,04
40,"Great hotel, friendly service, amazing location","If you want to stay in the very heart of Barcelona then this is the hotel for you ! Great, new rooms, beautiful outdoor restaurant and amazing service - we even got given a glass of Cava at check in !!! We'll be back !!!",5,2016,09,04
40,Bad experience,"We never made it to the hotel, in case it could be possible to be a really nice hotel. My mother, in her 80's, would have loved to stay here. But in the middle of the bookings process they decided to give our rooms to other guests... They apologized for the inconvenience and put us on a waiting list. Not something you would expect from a 5 star hotel!",1,2016,09,03
40,Large comfortable room. Very elegant. Great location.,"High ceilings, comfortable bed, large bathroom with large tub and separate shower. Great reprieve from the city. Concierge set up football tickets and a rental car so we could drive up to Cadequez for the day. They brought the rental car right to the hotel. The breakfast buffet was elaborate and high quality. We will be back next time in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,31
40,The best hotel experience so far!,"This hotel took me by surprise - from exterior you will hardly notice it, but as soon as you step in - the service, room quality and the food is superb!  The reception staff members were most helpful with anything we needed.  The terrace rooftop bar was nice spot to chill at night.  Hotel is very centrally located right next to Passeig de Gracia.  Very cool feature for techies - finger print entry to the rooms, so you don't lose your key!",5,2016,08,23
40,Fabulous modern hotel very central,"This has to be the best reception we have ever experienced at a hotel and we travel a lot! The receptionist was polite, informative, caring & could not do enough to ensure we had a great time in Barcelona. Very centrally located with easy access to Casa Battllo, La Pedrera & La Ramblas etc etc. One of the best hotels in one of Europe' s best cities. Cannot wait to return!",5,2016,08,23
40,Above and Beyond..,"Alma and the staff should be commended.  Upon check in on 8/19, after an all night flight, they had our rooms ready by 1100   Then the host heard us talk about soccer (Fútbol) and arranged tickets to Barcelona-Real Betis. Once in a lifetime experience!   Sadly, we left items in the room but the staff had them waiting for us upon return.  I cannot give a higher rating.  THANK YOU!",5,2016,08,22
40,Great choice for our relaxing holiday,"Chose Alma for our recent vacation in Barcelona. We decided to spend a week immersing ourselves in this great city. The location in Eixample was perfect for us - near lots of fine shopping and restaurants, but not in the busy (and noisy sections) of La Rambla or Gotic. Right between the Gaudi sites of La Perdrera and Batllo, and a 15 minute walk to old city. Was far from the beaches, but taxis are cheap.

Everything about the hotel is simple and elegant. The rooms are comfortable and very modern. Excellent TV (this was Olympics week), and great waterfall shower.

The morning breakfast was super, which we took in the gardens outside. Great way to get fueled for our days of walking the city. The outside area was also delightful in the evening for cocktails. The rooftop bar was also a treat, with spectacular views looking down to the city. There is a view to La Perdrera, but this section is closed for private events. Management should figure a way to allow access to that side of the roof.

We also enjoyed the spa, nice facilities, although no reception area. The Alma massage was first rate, the attendants were excellent.

Service throughout was excellent. The front desk was well covered and all the gentlemen were helpful and spoke fluent English. 

Alma gets strong reviews because it is an excellent boutique property. 

",5,2016,08,22
40,Great choice for our stay in Barcelona!,"You can't beat the location! Close to many attractions - 15-minute walk to Sagrada Familia, less than 5-minute walk to Casa Mila, about 10-minute walk to Casa Batllo. If you enjoy shopping, LV is just across the hotel, a few minutes walk to Prada, Gucci, Chanel, Loewe and many more shopping. Metro is very close by. 

It would be great if they can provide coffee machine in the room. My hubby worked at night so inconvenient without coffee machine though mini-bar (cold drinks only) is free. This is the reason why I gave 4 star for service.",4,2016,08,20
40,Excellent Hotel in Great Location!,"5 Star all the way! You will love the location, restaurants and shopping nearby and you will love the Hotel! I stay in Ritz as well as other high end hotels Club Level. You will be happy with the hotel. Although hotel is in a busy location, the hotel is quiet. If traveling other places, our other hotel was on the noisy side at all hours.",5,2016,08,19
40,The most beautiful and charming hotel,"This hotel is just perfect! The location in the city is ideal , the service is competent and very helpfully and the rooms are anyway great. I enjoy every stay and could not wish more comfort . Thank you for this hotel and especially the hotel manager Mrs. Coloma",5,2016,08,17
40,Excellent hotel ,"I can only say good things about this hotel.  Excellent service, the best location, personnel was extremely professional.  Walking distance to everything.  The room was perfect.  I wanted to say longer.  Next time without any Doubt will go back to this wonderful hotel.  ",5,2016,08,14
40,Summer vacation,"Great location, walking distance to the train system and to one of Gaudi's museum. Strong A/C, great toiletries and the towels are nice and fluffy and soft. The mini fridge is replenished free of charge once a day. There is a convenience store around the corner and lots of luxury stores for shopping. Its also walking distance to the main street for restaurants and tourist spots.",5,2016,08,13
40,"Great hotel, luxurious, and strong service","Pros: Location, service, quiet, and extremely comfortable.

Cons: The fitness/gym facilities are a little small but use what space they have. Bit of awkward setup in this area.

Location: Easy walk from many major tourist attractions, many restaurants, and more... in the middle of everything.

In short we enjoyed staying here and would again when back. The hotel is in a very convenient location, close to some nice areas and restaurants. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was huge and comfortable, very clean, and top notch with bathroom amenities, linens, etc. Lots of the little things that make a hotel a leading hotel.",5,2016,08,11
40,In My Opinion - Outstanding !,"The location is ideal - it's close to everything. 
Rooms are modern, spacious, spotless and functional and have USB ports. 
Beds have memory foam mattresses and very comfortable. 
Mini bar items are free , finger print room access so no carrying huge room keys around. 
Service levels are high. They pay attention to every detail. Concierge incredibly helpful. 
Breakfast buffet is $25 euros per person with a large selection of items including hot items made to order. 
They take coffee almost as serious as Starbucks with a barista on site. 
Cute courtyard garden for late night drinks. 
Great hotel - highly recommend it. 
",5,2016,08,10
40,Terrific Hotel in Barcelona - PERFECT LOCATION!!,"The Alma Barcelona is a perfect choice for someone on their first visit to Barcelona.  My wife and i stayed at the hotel for four nights and it was an ideal choice.  We were both first timers and naturally excited to see the architecture of Gaudi, among the many sights to see in Barcelona.  The ALMA is in a great location, just a block away from La Pedrara (Casa Mila) and a few blocks from Casa Battlo.  It's also very close to great restaurants and coffee shops, making the neighborhood perfect for us.  We only had to walk about 15 min. to get to Basilica de la Sagrada Familia, and the ALMA is very close to the subway lines that offer easy access to the other main attractions, such as Parc Guell, La Boqueria/Las Ramblas.  Could not have been a better location.

On top of the location, of course, the hotel itself is fantastic.  Great service, nice decor, friendly staff, and even a rooftop bar / deck that made great drinks.  We didn't eat at the restaurant - primarily because there are so many good restaurants nearby, but the area out back was lovely and we spent an afternoon relaxing there.  Highly recommend the property.

ALMA is definitely not the cheapest option in Barcelona, but I felt we got a great return on the money - we had a great stay and I'd gladly stay here again.",5,2016,08,08
40,Great location,Great location and heaven for the minimalists. The breakfast is very good and staff are helpful. In the heart of designer shopping district. The lights are dimmed in the llobby and in the room. Doors open with a finger print which is really cool,3,2016,08,06
40,Nice Modern Hotel in a Great Location,"We enjoyed our stay at the Alma Barcelona, the hotel is very modern and the old meets new architecture was very interesting.  There are absolutely no views, all rooms seem to look out onto other buildings close-by.  A couple of minor nits for me - when you turn the bathroom light on a bright light in the hall outside the bathroom also goes on which could disturb someone sleeping in the room; they provide body wash, but no wash cloths, just large towels and hand towels.  My adult kids (brother and sister) shared a room with two twin beds and found it a little awkward that there was no door to the bathroom (though the wc was private).  We had booked a 3 night stay, then went north up the Costa Brava for 3 nights and were supposed to come back to the Alma for the last 3 nights, but decided to try a different hotel in a different neighborhood with a little more privacy for my kids.  The rooftop bar was great, with an outstanding mixologist.",4,2016,08,05
40,Lovely boutique hotel,"We just stayed at the Alma for 4 nights and loved it.  The hotel is in an amazing location in the lovely Eixample neighborhood, walking distance to all sights and with many great shops and restaurants nearby.  It is only one block to Gaudi's La Padrera building.  The staff were so nice from the minute you check in, even offering you a glass of wine or cava while they check you in.  

Beds were supercomfortable and the rooms are lovely, with lots of storage space.  The shower is open to the room but in a separate dressing area that is separated by a permanently affixed wooden screen.  The shower was wonderful, with great water pressure.The dressing area does not get much natural light due to the screen, so it is a little dark for a woman putting on makeup, but not a big deal.

There is no pool at the hotel, but it has a lovely garden on the ground level, as well as a roof deck with great views of the city.  While the hotel does have a young feel, we absolutely loved it, and we are around 50.  Concierges were very nice and helpful, giving great advice on restaurants.  WiFi was free and strong signal in our room.  Also, while the hotel was full when we were there, we NEVER heard a peep from anyone in adjoining rooms (we were in room 511 - nice courtyard views)

I would highly recommend this hotel, it exceeded our expectations.",5,2016,07,31
40,Will Stay Again!,"Barcelona was our first stop after a day of long flights so I wanted a comfortable place to recover. We were not disappointed. The bed was superb and with the windows open pleasant music drifted up from the courtyard. We even had a glimpse of Gaudi from our room. The bar is relaxing and welcoming, and the food excellent.

I was so happy I tried to make a list of shortcomings.  I know the modern and open design is not for some people. Otherwise, we could have used a couple of wine glasses in our room, certainly a few more chairs in the wonderful pool and spa area,  and maybe some beer on tap in the bar. We will be back!",5,2016,07,31
40,Excellent hotel in a beautiful area of Barcelona,"Fantastic hotel, we stayed for 3 nights in the Alma Suite which is an amazing huge room with a beautiful terrace overlooking the street.

Staff were all first class, really helpful and informative when we were looking for great restaurants and sent us to places outside the tourist traps.

The hotel is well placed in a classy area of the city, walking distance to the busier tourist areas but in a more prime area, with more traditional cafes and restaurants around the avenues.    We thought the location was ideal. 

The room is very modern, well equipped and the mini bar is inclusive in the room rate.   Breakfast costs an extra 25 euros per person - but it is worth it and served directly to our outdoor terrace with fresh eggs, smoked salmon, fresh berries and good quality coffees.

Would definitely recommend to friends as you get better bang for your buck then other 5 star options.

Highly recommended 5*",5,2016,07,31
40,Modern design with great staff,"We went to visit Barcelona after traveling through cities in Basque and Granada. We arrived a bit early, but were able to check-in smoothly with very kind and friendly staff.

The lobby’s atrium is very sophisticated having the view of the garden terrace next to the restaurant. The bedroom was very cosy and the complimentary mini bar was useful.

But there is only one room without bath on each floor, and we were the guest who had no bath in our bathroom. I found the fact on trip advisor after coming back to home. I was really disappointed. We thought we had no choice of the bathroom.

The bathroom (technically shower room) had no door and it made flood on the floor every time I took shower, which was a problem.

Over all, I enjoyed the stay. Particularly hotel staff was very nice. The rooftop bar was lovely too.",4,2016,07,30
40,Simply Outstanding! ,"We stayed for 8 days in two rooms. Extremely helpful and genuine concierge advices of restaurants, where to go and etc. Excellent accessible location to all activities. Lots of brands boutiques and shops around. Lovely terrace garden. Rooms with Twins Double Beds have an expanded toilets. Its true the shower door has no privacy. Also there is a strong smell of Charco grill in corridors to our rooms and our room. Otherwise, great value of money. Housekeeping detailing was amazing and truly hygienic. ",5,2016,07,30
40,Stylish Barcelona,"We stayed in an Executive Suite with child bed for 3 nights, which worked out marginally cheaper than two rooms at this or other similar hotels in Barcelona. The hotel is in a lovely building, which has been tastefully restored with plenty of design elements. It's in a good downtown location with easy access to the main tourist attractions. Our room was at the front of the building on the first floor; it was clean, spacious, high-ceilinged and well-equipped. In other words, everything was according to or beyond our expectations. But almost the best thing of all was the service, which was always friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and efficient. All in all a wonderful stay in a stylish hotel.",5,2016,07,30
40,Awesome place!!!,"The hotel is in the excellent location of Barcelona. 5 min walk to Casa Milla and Casa Bartllo, less than 15 min walk to Sagrada Familia, 10 min walk to Plaza de Catalunya and La Rambla and 1-2 min walk to Passeig de Gracia the famous shopping districts. Room is excellent with very nice green backyard. Breakfast is excellent. Staff is very helpful especiially Xavi who gave good advice on museums/arts and good place to visit (incl re the Boqueria market). Would like to visit the hotel again once in Barcelona",5,2016,07,30
40,Not if you're over 30,"So, we arrived, the reception was lovely,,,,,,from there, down hill all the way! Room was not at all what I expected, no privacy to take a shower, no light to make up, the phone...you need a Phd to figure out, the hairdryer is broken, they'll fix it later ( later is too late).....the room was a sauna upon arrival, and no one to explain the airco...really, you know people are checking in on a 30 degree day, you don't cool the room.....awful awful awful...I HATE THIS HOTEL!",3,2016,07,29
40,Nearly Outstanding,"This is the 2nd time we have stayed at the Hotel Alma, last week in fact! This time was for a 4 night stay to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. 

I liaised with customer relations well before we arrived by email requesting a bottle of pink champagne and some white lilies and white roses be in our superior room for arrival, this they gladly did, champagne on ice, flowers beautiful!!

An underwhelming entrance to the hotel, but once inside very cool hotel, great rooms (superior), great big shower, great staff and good location. Given the time of year the roof top terrace was open serving great cocktails and wine and with a great view of Barcelona looking towards the sea in the distance.

Having said the above, and having had another good stay and experience, having advised the hotel that we would be celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary - a touch of class missing from this 5 star boutique hotel - not a card, compliment slip, acknowledgement when down stairs recognising our very special day on the day, a real shame a trick missed I think.",4,2016,07,28
40,Lovely  hotel ,"We spent 2 nights in this hotel and enjoyed our stay. We are a couple in our 40s with a 6 year old son.

The staff are lovely and the hotel is in a great location.

Our room was a great size but a little dark for our liking (a bit hard to find things in your suitcase when the windows were closed). Some people may like this though but we prefer a bright room.

Breakfast was beautiful but not cheap. Again, the service is a real stand out though which makes it a great place to stay. 

",4,2016,07,28
40,3 night stay at the end of a Southern France holiday,"The hotel is very nice with very comfy beds, Its a bit of a walk to the Ramblas and Gothic quarter ( 20 mins ) but if you want high end shopping its very close by. The reception staff were very good and even did the pretend ' we have given you an upgrade' , when in fact it was just the room we had booked. We asked for a restaurant booking on the second night but they said it was full which was very odd as when we checked later there were very few tables taken . Garden is lovely and a bottle of house wine 25 euros which is good. On the whole we were reasonably satisfied but spoilt by not being able to eat there.",3,2016,07,27
40,Fabulous Hotel!,"I highly recommend the Alma. It is located in a great, central location and the service could not have been better. Quentin assisted us at check in and was absolutely so helpful. Everyone is friendly, speaks English and goes out of their way to help you have an extraordinary vacation experience. Our room was perfection. Thick walls and doors keep noise out. Our room was overlooking the courtyard. So romantic.",5,2016,07,27
40,Birthday,Staff professional and very very pleasant.....room was spotlessly clean and modern.....location was perfect about ten minute walk to sagrada familia and lovely little back street bars etc. and a late night mini market around the corner. We will definitely return. They even put a bottle of cava and some cake with a lovely little birthday note in our room as it was my partners birthday.,5,2016,07,26
40,A quiet haven in the middle of Barcelona,"From the very helpful and welcoming staff to the lovely calm interior of the hotel you will find the hotel Alma a real delight. We were lucky to have a room available straight away, and unpacked and hit the streets and shops running. After a full day experiencing this fabulous city we retreated to our lovely room with a great rain head shower, and went up to the funky rooftop cocktail bar for a well earned drink and had a great view over the city skyline. Great music and staff. The garden courtyard makes you feel you are not in a city of apartment blocks, but a semi rural setting. Friendly staff and a new chef keen to make his mark were a highlight.loved the decor and hi tech finger keypads for your room. Can't go past the Alma for one of the best nights in Barcelona.",5,2016,07,26
40,Immerse yourself in Gaudi,Staff were welcoming and professional.  Room was comfortable with a fully stocked complementary minibar that was refilled daily.  Our room had a view of the rooftop of one of the Gaudi buildings.  Location was walking distance to almost all the sights.  We would gladly return here.,5,2016,07,25
40,Excellent boutique hotel in a perfect location.,"Hotel Alma was a perfect choice for us during our stay in Barcelona. Before we even arrived, they were helpful, making and changing restaurant reservations and giving great help for tours and other pertinent information in the city. The rooms were comfortable and the location can't be beat. We walked everywhere! Make this hotel your home in Barcelona!!",5,2016,07,25
40,You'll fall in love with Alma Barcelona,"Last week we returned from a Mediterranean cruise which left from Barcelona. This was the second time we cruised out of Barcelona. The first time we fell in love with the city. This time we fell in love with a hotel, the Alma Barcelona. We spent two nights there before our cruise and one night after the cruise. The Alma is in a great location, is ultra modern, and absolutely gorgeous. Our suite was huge and the bed was comfortable with the softest pillows. I slept like a baby. There is a backyard restaurant and bar which is an oasis in the middle of this bustling city. It is so pretty that locals stop there at the end of the day for tapas and a glass of wine before going home. The rooftop bar is charming and the bartenders know how to make some great drinks. Our party of six were admiring how they made one particular cocktail, and when we inquired about it the bartender made another one and sent us shots for us to taste his creation. We all agreed it was delicious. The people at the reception area are the friendliest, most helpful front desk people I've met anywhere. Their recommendations for restaurants and things to do were spot on. We loved every place they suggested. I even met my new best friend in Barcelona, who works the front reception area. He calls himself ""chubby"", although I don't think he weighs 150 lbs soaking wet. I found out later his name is really Javier, or Javvy, for short, which sounds like chubby to Americans. He couldn't do enough to assist us with anything we needed. Chubby is a wonderful asset to the hotel and made our stay memorable. We can't wait to return to Barcelona, and our new favorite hotel, the Alma.",5,2016,07,23
40,DON'T LET ANYONE SEE YOUR VALUABLES,"When checking into this hotel you sit at a desk in an open lobby.  Bellman and other staff members are able to see what you do.  In my case, passports were requested.  I removed my passports from two wallets and put the wallets back into luggage sitting behind me.  My room was not ready and I had to wait.  Went to lunch and returned observing my luggage being placed into my room (my son had an adjoining room).  After we retreved something from my son's room I saw that the Bellman had not left my room.  Long story short, two wallets were taken from my baggage.  I would not recommend leaving anything valuable in your luggage in situations like this.  I went in with the wallets and left without the wallets.  Hotel staff wants to say things like this never happy at their 5 star hotel.  Believe me, it has NOW.  I cannot recommend this hotel.",1,2016,07,19
40,Outstanding and simplistic design.,"We had a superior room size. Lots of space; large bathroom and the hotel design thought of everything by providing USB charging ports and iPad plugs for charging. Which alleviated the need to use voltage adapters. Our room faced court yard. Location amazing close to all Gaudi sites, wlking distance. View from roof top amazing you can see the chimney stacks of the Gaudi site. Service great on all levels. After being in many small rooms in Europe this felt decadent. Front desk check in service amazing",5,2016,07,19
40,Chic experience,"Cool, chic, modern, elegant. We loved staying in this well located hotel. The facilities were first rate (really nice showers, shampoo, mattresses, etc.) and the breakfast buffet was the best I've had anywhere, with fresh squeezed orange juice to die for. Staff members were really helpful about directions and spoke perfect English. The best parts were the beautiful garden restaurant in the central courtyard (an oasis in the heat), and the top floor bar and deck with a view of the Sagrada Familia. We were able to walk to that as well as Las Ramblas and the beach. Close to metro stops, too.",5,2016,07,18
40,"Cool, modern hotel with impeccable service!","I loved the Alma. We had a great room, sleek suite with amazing amenities. Everyone super professional, and it is in an amazing location. Breakfast is pricey, but sandwiches and wine are not. Great place for lunch. Beautiful outdoor patio and indoor bar. Close to three Gaudi sites and tons of shopping. The sweet life.",5,2016,07,17
40,Very modern rooms,"This hotel provides very modern facilities. Even key access was with your fingerprint!!!!!! Very cool!!
 It is very beautiful and the staff are very helpful. 
The location was ideal to get around to most places in beautiful Barcelona.

",5,2016,07,16
40,Mr Michael Orridge,"We have just returned from another fantastic holiday at this lovely hotel. If we ever go to Barcelona again we would not consider staying anywhere else. 

The staff are very attentive, nothing is too much trouble. 

The contemporary rooms are stylish and well equipped with free minibar as a bonus including local lager, water, various coca colas and bottles of natural fruit juice all complimentary.

My wife and I returned for our wedding anniversary and I emailed beforehand to arrange for sparkling wine and flowers on arrival and they even arranged for our room to be ready on arrival rather than the customary 14.00 hours.

The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of Barcelona with Casa Mila being 100 metres away, Casa Batlo 500 metres away and Sagrada Familia approximately a 20-30 minute walk along the same road as the hotel.

There are numerous quality tapas bars restaurants and cafes in the vicinity so there is ample choice to eat out although the hotel restaurant serves delicious food.

We could not recommend this hotel more highly we have had a fantastic stay which was only enhanced by choosing the Alma Hotel.",5,2016,07,16
40,Best hotel in Spain,"As far as service, this is best hotel in  Spain.  Everyone is super friendly and very accommodating.  They go the extra mile to make your stay amazing.  Shower was amazing and huge.  Great location in Barcelona in between casa mila and casa ballto.  Highly recommended!!!!",5,2016,07,16
40,Perfect,"Very comfy rooms, no noise whatsoever even though it's on a great location. 
They serve a healthy breakfast. One night we ate at the inside garden (charming!) and then we went to the rooftop for a drink. Amazing handcrafted cocktails with beautiful views of the city.
A luxury Hotel that keeps the guests happy",5,2016,07,16
40,"Ultra Modern, nicely situated","My wife and I got off a Cruise and headed into Barcelona for one night. We stayed at Alma and found it very neat. Ultra modern, luxurious - shower/bath area extremely nice. Biometric keys to get in were an interesting touch. The style of this hotel will sit well with those that are meticulous, and like clean, minimal lines. Those that are looking for down-home comfort.. may find this hotel a bit cold (in color, style, and decor). Our rooms had limited places to sit, other than the bed and a lounge chair. The Office chair was simply uncomfortable and minimalistic. 
It was different, and ultimately we both liked it since it was close to where we wanted to be. Its a very short walk to Sagrada Familia..",4,2016,07,15
40,Robbed at this hotel,This is a lovely hotel with a great location. Our room was not ready upon arrival so we checked our luggage at the Front Desk and went out to lunch. We did not realize until checking out the next day that we no longer had the wallets. Hotel denies any responsibility. Move on.,2,2016,07,15
40,Chiq but not achingly trendy,"Well located with wonderful rooms, a lovely garden, and outstanding staff.  this is a property that really works and is a haven in what is a busy and hectic city.   The rooms are extremely well designed.",5,2016,07,14
40,Best hotel I have stayed in,Just a fabulous experience.  From the no key (it's all accessed by fingerprint) to the amazing rooms and the most amazing outdoor garden to relax in and drink Cava and nibble on Jamon this is truly an exceptional hotel.  It's not cheap but worth every cent.  Location is perfect - walking distance to everywhere you would want to go in Barcelona and the staff are attentive and helpful.,5,2016,07,14
40,"Sublime, modern, quiet ....","...set in a fantastic location, on Carrer de Mallorca off Passeo de Gracia (minutes from Casa Mila if that means anything to you). The hotel has dark tones, even in the spacious atrium - which gives it a more intimate atmosphere. Rooms can be accessed by key or fingerprint (loved it); the one I stayed  (executive suite) was spacious, with a wooden floor; a huge white bathroom, excellent products , nice furniture and quirky little additions that make the minimalist decor ... jovial. I slept well !!! Breakfast was superb, with great friendly service and evenings - in summer, it is well worth eating in the garden (book ahead) - the menu is excellent, featuring fresh produce.  The Alma has become my address when in BCN",5,2016,07,13
40,Great location and contemporary luxury hotel,"Alma is located very close to Passeig de Gracia so if shopping is your kind of activity, you are within walking distance to Channel, Loewe and Hermes. it is so close that you can easily drop off your shopping back to hotel after each stop to the above. Also a lot of tapa bars & shopping around. This is one of those modern hotels where you will use your thumbprint instead of a key ! It was kind of cool. It is overall a modern, contemporary and cool hotel. Word of caution if you are traveling with someone not so close and wanting to share a room, the bathroom has no doors so be prepared for that. We had breakfast in the hotel and it was great. They have a buffet style setting for the continental stuff but they also offer a menu for items from the kitchen where you can have your eggs etc. ,",5,2016,07,13
40,Simply Fabulous!,"The location of the hotel is wonderful. Walking distance from restaurants, shopping and important sites to see. The service in the hotel was the best we have seen. The greeting we received was warm and friendly with our room being ready early in the afternoon as we had requested. The bed was comfortable and the ""turndown"" service in the evening impeccable with slippers being left by our bedside on a mat for our comfort. The rooms were modern with a lot of amenities such as easy availability to plug in cellphones and IPADS. The only small negative was that there was not a full length mirror in the room. Everything else, including the delightful robes and fluffy towels was delightful.",5,2016,07,12
40,Great night sleep!,"I stayed at hotel Alma in February of this year for a long weekend and it was a lovely break! The beds are extremely comfortable and the spa is a must, total relaxation! The hotel is in a great location so everything is practically walking distance. The staff are incredibly helpful with making sure you make the most of your trip. The hotel amenities are also fantastic!",5,2016,07,12
40,Exceptional Stay,"Our experience included all positives:

-We were there very early in the morning. The staff was accommodating- provided recommendations, stored our bags, and checked us in.
-The location was perfect for accessing tourist sites as well as many near by restaurant and bars.
-The room was large with a great bathroom and storage space. Very clean and the bed was comfortable.
-Rooftop bar was a plus.",5,2016,07,11
40,an Oasis,"Great location, quiet well appointed rooms with super comfy beds. Helpful staff...but the best part is the leaf garden/courtyard for those couple of hours that you need to escape from the city to re-charge and go out for more fun.",5,2016,07,10
40,"Great Location, Great Staff","Lovely hotel, great rooms and great location in Eixample.  The staff are very very friendly and helpful.  We were greeted at the taxi and our bags taken in.  There is a spa and pool on site for guests but the pool is a bit small and in our case someone decided they wanted to swim lengths leaving no room for anyone else.  Lovely rooftop bar with great cocktails and views of Barcelona.  Only negative was the room was very dusty in places.  Obviously the cleaners miss the same areas of the room time and time again.  We only really spent time in the room on our last night so this was fed back to staff on checkout. They apologised but I felt they could have knocked a cocktail or something off our bill as this is a 5 star hotel and I expect better.  I would definitely return.",4,2016,07,08
40,Alma Barcelona service and facility was outstanding,"everything about Alma Barcelona was outstanding - room, service and food.  The rooftop bar was a nice surprise serving incredible drinks (The Great Gatsby in particular).  The hotel's check-in desk/concierge service was way above expectations always available to help.",5,2016,07,08
40,5 star experience - simply a pleasure to stay here.,"Very clean, quiet, and relaxing hotel. Service from the staff was excellent - very helpful, approachable and eager to help you in any way possible - from providing extra plug adaptors, to offering advice on local tourist attractions. Also excellent food - a good balance on local Catelan offerings and something to suit all tastes. Thank you for a great stay.",5,2016,07,08
40,best hotel,"staff are professional and helpful. the roof top has a great view and the every each restaurant has got a unique food. drink selection are great, located in a heart of fashion and almost near to different part of city ",5,2016,07,07
40,Wonderful Hotel,"All positive.  All the staff were very courteous and would go out of their way to help.  The rooms were clean, neat and quiet.  The breakfast buffet was 5 star quality.  Best hotel we stayed at during our 4-week vacation.  The location is very convenient to Barcelona sites like the Mila Casa and Sagrada Familia.  Many good restaurants in the area.",5,2016,07,06
40,Lovely staff but dusty room,"I stayed here for a couple of nights in July as part of a wider trip to Spain.
The hotel is in a great location far enough away from La Ramblas that it is quiet but still close to great bars and restaurants and to Sagrada Familia.
We were greeted from our taxi by a friendly member of staff who took our bags and checked us in. 
Room was nice and spacious with a lovely shower all in a minimalist style. The room was lacking a full length mirror and also a shaving mirror. There is a cool roof top terrace that serve flashy cocktails that's worth a look at as there is a good view of the cathedral.
 After the first night when I started to look more closely I noticed that there was a lot of white dust anywhere higher or lower than eye line. When we informed staff upon checking out they thanked us for pointing it out. This is not what I would expect from a 5* establishment and left a bitter taste in my mouth as I'm sure much cheaper hotels would not have this problem. 
",3,2016,07,06
40,Great time!,"The hotel is beautiful and extremely comfortable with an awesome staff.  Its in a great location, walk  to Gaudi houses, restaurants, shops, or take the Metro almost any place in town.  Its very quiet,  just off a main street.",5,2016,07,05
40,Classy hotel,"Alma Barcelona is in a great location easy walk to all major attractions  , Gaudi buildings on the next corner. Hotel has excellent service, outdoor garden, outstanding modern Spanish food. Rooms are beautifully furnished . Highly recommend. Rooftop bar has fabulous views over Barcelona, live music.",5,2016,07,03
40,amazing and beautiful!,We stayed here during our first stop of our multi cities European tour. Our travel agent suggested this spot and it was perfect. Check in was smooth. The room was perfect. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was perfect and close to my favorite site Casa Battlo. Also great restaurants nearby. We will definitely come back!,5,2016,07,01
40,"Excellent Hotel, Service & Location","This hotel is beautiful. We stayed in one of their suites, which was really large with a great sitting area. The room decor is a bit dark, but the bathroom is a contrast being all white with a separate soak tub and shower. We stayed in a room facing Calle Mallorca street, which at night is quiet, but starts to pick up during the day which is fine. One side note, we love the option of biometric entry to the room. We never ever once had to worry if we had the key, where we left it, finding it, etc.!

Room aside, the location is fantastic. The hotel is situated in Exiample, and if you love shopping and want to be away from the wild tourist areas (e.g., La Ramblas and the waterfront), this is the place to be. It's also extremely convenient to catch the metro anywhere--minus to the airport, which is a bit more complicated. You're also just a few walking minutes away from a few different Gaudi sites, like La Pedrera and Casa Battlo -- and ~15 minutes from Sagrada Familia. Best yet is their rooftop bar, where you can see La Pedrera and Sagrada Familia.

Speaking of the bar, we had drinks both on the rooftop terrace and the garden terrace. The rooftop bar has amazing cocktails, and if you're feeling a bit chilled in the evening, they've got blankets (fresh, clean ones), which I personally love! The garden terrace is very relaxing. It's a break away from the bustle of the city and has great tapas.

If that weren't enough, the service was great! We arrived on the eve of Sant Joan, where some of the restaurants were either fully booked or closed. The reception made a wonderful recommendation and booked us a spot at Restaurant L'Olives. If we ever find ourselves back in Barcelona, we'll be back to Hotel Alma!",5,2016,07,01
40,Elegant Stylish Friendship,"We stayed at this hotel with friends for 10 nights so we could leisurely soak up the delights of Barcelona. The hotel is beautifully stylish with lovely spacious rooms , elegantly designed comfortable and clean and with a spacious shower/bathroom area. Fingerprint access is great, no keys or cards to carry. Lovely bar area downstairs which leads into a relaxing garden area with chairs and tables nestled amongst them. There a number of ""secret gardens"" in Barcelona and this area is listed as one.
On the rooftop a cocktail bar open from 7 pm till 1 am fantastic and friendly.
The staff? well all bar none were courteous and helpful for the duration, nothing was too much trouble.
The Alma is also perfectly situated for access to all of the delights of Barcelona either on foot or using the cheaply priced but brilliant Metro system( make use of the T10 card).
Once again thank you Alma for being such a lovely host",5,2016,07,01
40,"The best hotel in Barcelona, period!!!","The staff was the friendliest of probably any hotel I have been at.  So attentive from the check-in to the check-out, and everything in between.  The new, modern style of the hotel was tremendous.  The rooms were very clean and large.  The bedding and pillows were awesome!!  The sleep was stellar.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona, whether it be business or pleasure.  The location could not have been better, close to the main tourist attractions Sagrada Familia and Casa Batllo.

I can't wait to go back to Barcelona and stay at Alma again!!!",5,2016,06,28
40,Modern yet comfortable,"Lovely Alma provided a warm welcome through great desk staff to public spaces and guest rooms that maximized modern conveniences without sacrificing the hotel's historic beauty. We especially loved the fingerprint reader instead of room key option, the modern bathtub and bathroom, and the divided sleeping and living area in the room. The breakfast was luxuriously delicious, and the furnishings throughout the building were appealing and comfortable.",5,2016,06,27
40,Could not be happier with this hotel!!!,"I chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and could not have been happier. 

The location of the hotel is outstanding, Calle Mallorca and Passeign de Gracia, right where you want to be. Alma is a modern boutique hotel with outstanding service and great decoration and ambience - very modern. We booked a suite which exceeded our expectations. It faced Calle Mallorca with excellent views, very bright and not noisy at all. There is a rooftop bar which serves outstanding drinks while enjoying 360 degree views of the city. There is also a spa with an indoor swimming pool, sauna and steam bath, great to relax after a day sightseeing. We paid approx. 330 euros per night for the suite which seems very reasonable for a suite in a luxury hotel like Alma. Highly recommended!!",5,2016,06,20
40,Great Boutique Hotel in Center of the City,Alma is the perfect size hotel for business travelers or couples on holiday.  Its central location makes it easy to walk to most major attractions and it is surrounded by fabulous dining. The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help you navigate the city. The back garden is very peaceful with good tapas and drinks.,5,2016,06,20
40,Perfect stay at Alma,"From the first E-Mail-Contact until the Good-bye we had a perfect stay at Alma. Everything was totally as expected and we can highly recommened the Alma. The location is perfect, rooms are very quiet and the staff is absolutely friendly.",5,2016,06,20
40,Second stay as good as the first,"We stayed at Alma last year and loved it so much we went back again (primarily to see Coldplay at the Olympic stadium). Last year we stayed in a suite, this year we stayed in the standard room. Based on the fact that the standard room is so great, we’ll likely continue to book it in the future. The suite is useful perhaps if you’re travelling as family - otherwise you’re likely to stay outside in the gorgeous patio area and perhaps that makes the extra space somewhat unneeded. Just a great, great space, beautifully located in Eixample off of Passeig De Gracia (and therefore near to the best restaurants). The outdoor garden bar is a slice of heaven. Our top choice.",5,2016,06,20
40,Excellent Hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel was excellent quality for the price.  Large room, big shower, Biometric entry to room, very clean, high tech, good air conditioning, convenient desk and an excellent front desk for assistance and recommendations.  Very nice outdoor patio with a good bar and restaurant on the main level.  Very friendly staff with excellent service.",5,2016,06,19
40,Perfect service perfect setting,"Alma is a boutique (small) hotel located in the center of the Eixample, the shopping district close to many of the artistic attractions in Barcelona.  The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds, ample storage, modern bathrooms, etc., etc.--everything you might expect from a top end hotel.  We had a room on the fourth floor facing a quiet courtyard with a glimpse of Sagrada Familia in the distance.  As we went to the various attractions and did some shopping for gifts, we found ourselves going in every direction from the hotel, but not too far for walking which met our needs exactly.

Where Alma really stands out is the perfect service.  From a welcome glass of cava to the concierge service to small gifts, Alma makes it clear that the comfort and happiness of the gues is number one.  For a couple in a new city, it is very helpful to have experts ready to help, and the Alma hotel  made sure that every request was met with friendliness and a smile.  If you book early, the rates can be much better, so on your next trip to Barcelona, do yourself a favor and reserve at the Alma.",5,2016,06,15
40,Looking forward to a repeat vist,"I stayed here for a couple of nights with my 13 year old nephew. 
We received a fabulous welcome from young, friendly staff who provided us with directions and restaurant suggestions with charm.
The room was quiet as we were overlooking the garden but very comfortable and well appointed. There was no charge for items in the minibar, water, beer, fruit juices and Coca Cola which is always a bonus. The only downside was that we couldn't get the overhead shower head to work, possibly broken but we didn't ask at reception as frankly we forgot!
Breakfast was the best I have encountered in any hotel, the choice was extensive, pastries, breads, variety of yoghurts, fruit, juices (freshly squeezed orange juice),charcuterie and cheese. Beautifully presented little sandwiches, variety of eggs on the menu - my nephew declared that the scrambled eggs were nearly as good as his mother's and she is an excellent cook and he is pretty discerning food wise. Again, friendly service in an attractive restaurant with large windows facing the garden. You can eat in the garden too. It was €25 for me and €14.50 for my nephew, particularly good value for him I thought.
The décor of the hotel is elegant and airy with high (double height) ceilings in the lobby, with inviting sofas and stylish lighting. The bar and restaurant are spacious and lead onto the lovely calm garden, 
We didn't use the spa or pool.
I would definitely go back again and the hotel is ideal for couples and girlfriends on a short break but we spotted several business people. The location is very central, near to the elegant Passeig de Gracia and smart shops, 15 minutes walk to the old town and close to the metro.
",4,2016,06,14
40,Amazing boutique hotel,"This hotel is amazing, the welcome with a beautiful glass of Cava,  the staff couldn't do enough for us and a gorgeous room. The room key was our fingerprint!! Everything was top notch and attention to detail was fantastic. The location was at the top of La Ramblas so very central for getting around and a stop for the open top bus around the corner. This bus is essential for sight seeing and take a 2 day pass as a great cheap way to see everything. Too much to see for 2 days, will definitely return and can't imagine that there is anywhere better to stay!",5,2016,06,13
40,Great place to stay,"Stayed here for 6 days and was very happy with our choice of hotel
In a great location and tucked away in a side street just off the touristy Passeig de Gracia
The staff are all really friendly and took the time to talk us through a map of Barcelona and where the main tourist places are upon check in
Hotel is modern (finger print recognition as the key), spacious and well air conditioned. The mini bar is complimentary and is restocked each day (water, juice, coke, beer)
There was a massive walk in shower, with separate entry for the toilet and the room itself was very spacious
Spa area consists of a sauna, steam room, gym and indoor pool. Small but very nice
Only downside was that the roof terrace was closed this time of year (quite why I don't know - would have been perfect for sunbathing without having to trek to the beach). The garden is nice though. Bar and restaurant very good too
A bit far from the beach (45 - 60 minute walk) but close to a lot of other tourist places (if you don't mind a half hour walk)",5,2016,06,12
40,Worthy of a 5 had the roof terrace been open,"We stayed for 6 nights and upon arrival we were seated, checked in with a choice of complimentary drinks (take one as you will be there for 10 minutes) finger prints taken for keyless room entry and you are given a brief description of Barcelona the best bits/where to eat etc, whilst you are seated your bags are taken to the room. 
The rooms are spacious and very comfortable also the minibar is complimentary and restocked each day. 
We used the spa on a daily basis and it was always very quiet and relaxing after a busy day exploring. The only negative I have is that the roof requires plastering. 
Unfortunate the roof terrace was closed for our entire stay which was very disappointing and we were not given a reason as to why this was nor were we informed before or on arrival. Hence the 4* 
Although it is nice in the garden. Other than that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would book here again if we were to come back. 
If you are beach lovers I wouldn't advise you to stay so far away, we only visited the beach once as it was an unpleasantly long walk. 
",4,2016,06,10
40,Wonderful place to base yourself in Barcelona,"Stayed here for three nights in June 2016 with my partner.  A fantastic space, clean,  modern, a great place to stay when visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona.  Excellent service from all the staff, the best service I've ever had actually.  The rooms are modern and spacious.  Great bathrooms with powerful luxurious showers.  Couldn't ask for more, well worth the money.",5,2016,06,09
40,Alma Hotel Barcelona,Great hotel in good location. Very nice garden to have a drink or meal in. Staff very helpful in suggesting & booking local restaurants within walking distance. Didn't try the spa or pool but they looked very nice. Room was spacious with great facilities. Would definitely stay there again. ,4,2016,06,09
40,Excellent choice for Barcelona,"After travelling half way around the world from Brisbane, Australia, we were welcomed and excited after seeing our room, facilities, location of Alma Barcelona Hotel.
The check in service was completed extremely well and efficiently.
The staff here, the dining, the lounge bar and room service were all excellent.
The room was well fitted out and believe more a 6 star accommodation.
The service desk gave us good options for day tours, local restaurants.
Well done Alma, we would fully recommend  to any one staying in the lovely city of Barcelona.
We were here principally to join a Cruise, which was also close for the occassion.",5,2016,06,08
40,The only hotel to stay at in Barcelona,"We just returned from a trip to Spain, including a four night stay at the Alma. The experience was one of our best hotel experiences ever. The hotel is beautiful, with lots of wood, artwork, and a modern but very comfortable feel to it. The rooms were large (ours overlooked the courtyard so it was extremely quiet), the bathroom included a large rain shower, and the toilet was separate which is a big plus. Great amenities, including a free mini-bar that included juice, water, and beer. All the staff we encountered were professional and friendly, from the front desk to the housekeepers, bar and wait staff. The beds included a type of feather bed/pillow that we loved, and even though we had a king bed there was a separate duvet for each of us. Also, the A/C was very efficient and QUIET. It is very convenient to the shopping area of Barcelona, and Casa Mila. We were sad to have to move on. As we checked into our next hotels, the same phrase came up: ""Well, it's nice, but it's not the Alma!"" We won't go to Barcelona again unless we can stay at the Alma!",5,2016,06,05
40,Love and hate,"We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in late May, 2016. The pleasant surprise is that the hotel provides free drinks in the room, with water, juice and beer replenished everyday; the room has wardrobe, high grade towels, king size beds and a lovely garden backyard for all guests to enjoy. It is quiet and in a great location. We like the keyless entry with the use of finger print. The room is spacious and the service is generally good. While I love all these features, I have experienced the most bizarre way of mixing up the guests in the rooms in that we have booked a total of 3 rooms, and the booking was done by my friend (leader) with his credit card. Despite all the check in procedure with my own credit card for my own room and with my finger print for that room, I was mixed up with my leader of the group. As a result, he was charged with all my room charges, and that was discovered days after we returned to our own country. It is fixed today but the management still felt justified and put the blame on us. Indeed, another error occurred in that we have booked an extra day and got a fixed rate, it took pain to uncover and that was resolved because our leader was fortunately took care to ask and write down the name of the person who confirmed the booking of the extra day by phone prior to the trip. During checked in with our 3 rooms, the initial response was that ""sorry, you did not book an extra day and you have to pay the normal day rate for this extra day which is more than 100 Euro higher than what was given"". Therefore, the management paper work has a lot to learn to put it in the top-rated hotel and before that happens, one just has to be careful with any reservation and paper work.",4,2016,06,02
40,Fabulous Hotel,"My wife and I booked an executive suite for 4 nights and loved the hotel.  The location just off Passeig De Gracia is perfect - we were able to walk to everything (though we did take a cab once to the top of Park Guell).  There is a fabulous wine store 3-4 blocks away and a huge number of restaurants within walking distance.  One of the hotel's wonderful features is a beautiful garden area - a great, serene place to relax after wandering the streets of Barcelona.

Our room faced the street yet was well insulated and we never noticed any street noise.  The room was large and comfortable with a nice sitting area.  The only very, very small negative was that walls of the room were a medium dark blue - with limited lighting, the room often seemed a bit too dark for our taste.

The staff couldn't have been better - we were efficiently checked in by a very nice man named Quintin - and found the rest of the staff to be friendly and helpful during during each interaction.

Overall - we loved the hotel and would not hesitate to return on our next stay in beautiful Barcelona!",5,2016,06,02
40,Garden of peace and tranquillity.,"Having stayed at this hotel previously it was interesting returning to compare visits. Make no mistake this is a good hotel, situated in the centre of Barcelona with a most wonderful garden at the rear of the hotel where one can eat, drink and just relax.

There is one thing to mention here regarding the garden and that it is used extensively by business people from the surrounding district and who can blame them. Sometimes you may find that the immediate area , in the garden after the inside bar area has been taken over by people carrying out business transactions, pushing tourists to the rear of the garden. Believe me that is no hardship but bear in mind this is a hotel for business and leisure.

Staff are brilliant and the reception area staff are a fountain of knowledge and information. Bedrooms comfortable, spacious and provide a good range of bathroom products. Restaurant provides good dishes and there are a multitude of other eating establishments close to the Alma.

Certainly a top of the range establishment,providing everything a traveller requires.",4,2016,05,29
40,Brilliant way to experience Barcelona!,The Alma Hotel is perhaps one of the most fabulously located city properties of Barcelona. It is located just of Passeig De Gracia and was only a few minutes away from all the main attractions. We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Alma for 5 nights with the family. I would highly recommend the above property fo a variety of reasons. Great concierge service very luxurious rooms spectacular location and a first for me in Europe a complimentary mini bar. Will stay here only the next time in Barcelona!,5,2016,05,27
40,Quaint botique hotel,"Our experience in this hotel was wonderful. It was right in the heart of Barcelona but on a quiet street. The service by hotel staff was exceptional and restaurant dining wonderful. The room, though small, was comfortable and spotless. Would not hesitate to return",5,2016,05,27
40,Good but could be better,"Sadly, this hotel has sacrificed function over esthetics. The room is comfortable but the bathroom is spartan and does not offer enough REASoNABLE place to hang towels and toiletries.  It does have enough closet space. A coffe machine would also be useful. The staff could learn to be less cold. The restaurant was excellent.",4,2016,05,24
40,Very Good Hotel,"Great location - right around the corner from Passieg de Gracia, with all the shops and the Gaudi buildings, with all the peace and quiet of a side street.
Good food - Both the restaurant and the bar have good food. Thursday night they had a performer singing.
Garden - Such a lovely green spot in the middle of a cobble city! Very enjoyable to sit there with a drink.
Good rooms - Bathroom, although lacking a door (the toilet room has a door, the bathroom does not), feels just like a spa! Two sinks, Huge bathtub and a shower that can fit 4!
room is spacious, beds are comfortable.
Great staff - The receptionists are nice and speak English well, will help you order tickets, answer all of your questions. The waiters at the restaurant are very professional. The waiters at the bar, even when overloaded with work, will stop and be 100% present when you make a request.",5,2016,05,23
40,Classy hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the Alma hotel for 4 nights and glad we did – the location is perfect and staff are extremely helpful.
- Close to 2 Metro stations.  Plenty of restaurants, café’s, shops and sites within easy walking.  
- Very responsive and helpful staff with a smile – helped make restaurant and activity reservations (one restaurant not as desirable as expected and they were glad to hear the feedback for future advice) 
- Unique Euro look throughout with interesting design features.  A little dark in some areas but very clean, and obviously they try to maintain a peaceful and quality ambiance.
- Music in the lobby one late afternoon was excellent.  Also had music in the bar area a couple nights.
- Excellent garden patio area to chill
- Room service breakfast was expensive (~25 euro) but very tasty with ample quantity of choice items.
- Free daily soda from the mini-bar.  Don’t see that very often.
- Room at the back of the hotel with a huge window that opened to a large open area.  Fresh air and ample light.
- We were upgraded to a Grand Deluxe without hesitation
-  Wifi was very effective and without charge
- All the room features one would want including oversize excellent shower, and very comfortable bed
We would definitely book again.",5,2016,05,22
40,Before we got there,"This is a pre-visit review, offered for those like ourselves who have never visited Barcelona and do not know the fine hotels and restaurants of the city. I judge a 5 star hotel first off by its concierge desk. With the input of friends and Internet research I requested 3 dinner reservations: for some reason my email address did not work for them but would you believe it I received three international calls from Ricardo and Santiago by way of sorting the bookings out. Additionally they very tactfully offered better alternatives for dining. I know that the total hotel experience will be top drawer on the efficiency, expertise and graciousness of the El Palace concierges.",5,2016,05,21
40,Glad we chose Hotel Alma as our hotel in Barcelona,What a beautiful hotel! Attentive service starting with the doorman. Loved the location and it is only a ten-minute walk to Acces restaurant which in my opinion is not to be missed if you stay in Barcelona. Alma's rooms are so beautiful and artistic. We loved everything about hotel Alma and if we return to Barcelona we will certainly stay there again.,5,2016,05,21
40,Almost perfect!,"We loved this hotel and would definitely return!

Why the four stars? We went during a particularly rainy week and our initial suite, room 401, smelled very musty. Thankfully after one night the hotel staff moved us to suite 301 and we had a perfect stay after that. They even moved our packed bags for us while we spent the morning enjoying the city. 

We went with our toddler and this was the perfect hotel for a child. The executive suite is huge! The bar restaurant would make a special/healthy meal for her for dinner. They provided a nice pack and play with an extra thick mattress to serve as a crib. They have stairs that lead from the entrance to the main lobby level. The door staff would routinely help lift our stroller up the stairs. 

The staff is exceptional and very polite. Even when I complained the first day, they treated us very kindly. 

The gym is small, but a nice space... best for cardio. The lap pool is very nice and relaxing. 

The finger print entry system didn't work for me. I had to use a key, but that was no problem. Unfortunately, the gym/pool entrance only works with finger access. However, you can get hotel staff to let you in easily. 

THE OUTDOOR COURTYARD IS AMAZING! In a busy city, it was wonderful to have this relaxing space to come back to. Our daughter would frequently busy herself with something while we enjoyed a latte or drink. This was a huge plus for us. 

Some talk about street noise. I think all suites may face the main street (i'm not completely sure about this). But with the window shutters completely shut this was not a problem for us. I think rooms facing the courtyard would be very quiet.",4,2016,05,20
40,"Location, Location, Location!",The Alma Barcellona is just off the main shopping street and two blocks from Las Ramblas.  It is a twenty minute walk to the Gaudi Cathedral and two blocks from one of the most interesting Gaudi designed houses.  We had a superior room which was very comfortable and roomy by European standards.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with lots of recommendations for restaurants.  My favorite feature of this hotel is the wonderful courtyard where you can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and relax in a quiet space after a busy day of sightseeing!  We will return to the Alma Barcelona.,5,2016,05,18
40,Great Hotel,"First visit to this hotel and this city. Modern, clean and conveniently located property. Rooms excellent. Breakfast fabulous. Best scrambled eggs and coffee in Spain!
Staff friendly and efficient. Parking extra.
Very comfy beds and pillows.",5,2016,05,17
40,Wonderful one night stay at this very nice hotel,We stayed at the Alma hotel for a single night after a transatlantic cruise and before boarding another cruise ship heading for Venice. The hotel was clean and welcoming with the porter coming out to get our luggage and then later deliver it to our room. The check in process was quick and easy with friendly clerks who spoke good English. A glass of wine was provided to refresh us. The room was large for Europe with a comfortable bed and a large modern bathroom with plenty of towels.We decided to eat breakfast at the hotel because rain was predicted for the next morning. The cost was 25 euros each which I felt was a little high but the quality and quantity of the food was excellent and coffee refills were provided.,5,2016,05,16
40,"great location, great hotel","We just returned from 4 nigths at the Alma and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel was within easy walking distance to attractions such as the Sagrada Familia, the gothic quarter, the market, Gaudi buidings as well as great shopping. The staff also put us on to some great nearby tapas bar. We based our stay on previous trip advisor postings and, after staying there, we felt they were right on in their praise.",5,2016,05,14
40,Great hotel!,"I wanted to go to Barcelona for my birthday and we stayed for the 3rd time in the Alma hotel. We still love it. Much more people than before were having drinks in the hotel bar - not only tourists I would say. It's good to see more people enjoying the hotel - the garden is wonderful. Too bad, it was too cold to really enjoy it. 
We had an Executive Suite - a really enjoyable room. Spacious, nice furniture and a large bathroom with Bulgari ammenities. Comfy bed, enough space and hangers for your clothes, a sitting area. What more does one want. We stayed 1 time in a Grand Deluxe room which is also very good room. A few remarks: our suite was on the first floor and as they are located on the busy street we could hear the traffic very well - next time I will ask for a higher level or we take a Grand deluxe again as they look out over the garden on the backside of the hotel and thus quiet. The rain shower was not giving a lot of water, so I used the hand thing which is not very convenient. This should not happen in a luxury hotel. And a broken plate covering the shower drain should also be replaced. We don't do breakfast at the hotel as there are other options in the area. They made some changes to the restaurant area, I liked it better before but do realise they can accommodate more people now.",5,2016,05,12
40,Excellent hotel in great location,We had a wonderful long weekend stay at this hotel.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The rooms were spacious.  The spa and pool were relaxing.  And all in a great location just off the Passeig de Gracia. It was well worth the money we spent. We would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,05,11
40,Great hotel with a great location!,"This is a super nice mid sized hotel that is close to everything, yet far enough away to be quiet.  The room was very nice and the hotel was easy to get in and out of. I'm a bit of a hotel snob and this place met all my expectations!",5,2016,05,09
40,Modern elegant hotel ,"We started our Barcelona vacation at Hotel Alma and I'm so glad we did. It's a beautiful hotel with a very nice restaurant and spa. We were upgraded to an executive suite and it was huge with a gorgeous bathroom. The concierge staff is one of the best I have ever met. They took such great care of us with all our sight seeing tours, reservations and all of their suggestions were amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone saying in Barcelona. Its very quite and relaxing and just a short walk to las ramblas and also the la Sagrada familia. ",5,2016,05,08
40,Stylish oasis in central Barcelona,"We stayed for four nights in the Alma Barcelona and we throughly enjoyed it:
- very stylish and centrally located hotel
- very attentive and helpful staff
- excellent hotel restaurant with a compact menu, but everything really at fine dining quality (something very seldomly encountered in hotel restaurants, even at 5 star level).

When we come back to Barcelona, we will make sure to come back to Alma!",5,2016,05,02
40,"An elegant rest, in the middle of everything","This small hotel has elegant rooms, with indirect lighting, amazingly comfortable beds
and duvets, and luxurious surfaces in the furniture and bath.  There are many
concierge and front desk assistants, young and eager to help.  The first one we met
gave us a very helpful overview of the city and certain close restaurants at different
price levels. The lounge area seems like a magnet for travelers and their guests - in
a garden (with seating inside as an option) with lovely plantings and attractive contemporary seats. Drinks are 5 euros. Families were near us and just as happy to be there. Come try the Alma! It's the best.",5,2016,05,02
40,"SLEEK & HIP BUT NO BATHROOM DOORS,","PROS:Great location in the fashionable Exaimple. Sleek decor, stunning atrium.
Beautiful quiet garden & patio.Good concierge service. Excellent breakfast ( but $$$)  & bar service. 
This hotel is for the young & hip. Very dark halls & room. Bare modern decor..
Bathroom ( not separate toilet ) has no door. Shower has half glass door..so there is no privacy & chilly showering. Absurd design. WIFI erratic..cannot charge easily.
Housekeeping poor.. meager towels, few hangers, bed not made until late.
Mini bar not cold.",3,2016,04,30
40,"Beautiful, friendly and posh","Loved staying at this old hotel. Decorated with beautiful modern amenities. The staff was kind and helpful.
We enjoyed tapas and cocktails in the outdoor courtyard. 
We upgraded to a beautiful suite. Beautiful bathroom with tub and separate shower. Great water pressure. ",5,2016,04,24
40,"A lovely, lovely small hotel","The Alma is a quiet, comfortable, boutique hotel with low lighting and contemporary styling throughout. We knew we were up to date when, at check-in, we were offered an opportunity to record our thumbprints to use at our door instead of a key. Some people apparently decline the offer for privacy reasons, but we loved the convenience of never having to remember to take our key when we left the room. Our room was better designed for travelers than any we have seen recently. There were iPhone and Android charging cables hard-wired in the wall, USB ports, plenty of electrical outlets, good lighting, a simple but functional desk, free wi-fi, of course, and a great walk-in shower. We could see the distinctive chimneys of a Gaudi apartment building from our 6th-floor window. Even the restaurant was beautifully appointed with excellent service and excellent food. We usually avoid hotel restaurants, but this one was a great choice after hours of walking the city, and the price was as reasonable as any we found on the street. Perhaps the best part of our stay, though, was a young and willing concierge staff with at least one or two people always on duty (even overnight) to help with every sort of advice for eating, tours, translations from the prevailing Catalan language, and tending to problems that might come up in the room. When our room's cordless phone failed to ring, a young woman from the concierge desk accompanied us to the room, checked it out herself, called a tech when she couldn't make it work, then went away and brought in a new phone when the tech couldn't figure out the problem. It took five or ten minutes.",5,2016,04,24
40,Excellent Hotel,"Having just come from London (Royal Horseguards) and then Paris (Hotel Du Louvre) this hotel was an unexpected treat. It is ultra modern, very comfortable beds and pillows, breakfast assortment was more than expected with eggs cooked to order, lovely garden. The room appears sparse but it's wonderfully equipped with all modern amenities. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,04,23
40,Amazing Hotel,"This is an hotel tucked away in a side street off Passeig de Gracia. The location is central and service was excellent.The room was spacious. However, I would have liked a couple more chairs and a bigger desk. We had to sit on the bed to watch TV. The desk was so small that once you put your computer on, there was no space on the desk for anything else. They also did not provide a luggage rack, and we had to sit our suitcases on the bed side tables. We also had to ask for a kettle to boil water to make tea, which they readily brought up to us. Despite all of these minor inconveniences, they were very willing to help in whatever way they could to make your stay enjoyable. The restaurant was also excellent, and I would recommend eating at their restaurant",5,2016,04,23
40,Amazing!!,"My wife and I ordered a hotel room for one night away from the kids. We celebrated an anniversary. Cozy room so we did not want to leave him...Amazing hotel in a modern atmosphere and a stunning room. I highly recommend the hotel you just enjoy. 
",5,2016,04,22
40,A bit overrated,"Very good location, clean and adequate. I would expect more from a 5 stars hotel. Very impressive entrance but a bit disappointing room. Very basic toiletries,no  coffee machine in the room and very patchy wifi ( we stayed two nights and the second day could not connect at all, and staff was not able to fix our connection in the room).
Bizzarely in our room the toalet was in a separate room from the bathroom and the shower but did not have a sink. 
The hotel has a small gym and pool, both usable but hard to think that thhey were a touch of luxury. 
Staff was nice and we have got very good tips about the local restaurants. The hotel restaurant was very good and the garden is a nice touch.  
Overall, the hotel was OK but nothing special. Next time I am in Barcelona, I will be looking for other options in the same price range.",3,2016,04,21
40,Excellent hotel in Eixample district of Barcelona,"Family of 4 stayed in 2 deluxe room for 6 nights.  Overall highly recommend the hotel.
Pros: Excellent location, very friendly and helpful staff, rooms are excellent.
Cons (not really significant): Breakfast is good but a little pricey (25 euro);if you having dinner at bar the service is slow.  Room 100, 101 can get noise in the night(to 1 AM) from people from the bar in the courtyard area.
But overall we would definitely stay here again on our next visit.",5,2016,04,20
40,"Good, not necessarily the best in the area","The Alma is a good hotel for those wishing to stay in the Passeig de Gracia area. My room was quite spacious for a European hotel (I believe I may have received an upgrade). I have only two criticisms: (1) the room could have used additional or more conveniently-placed power outlets; and (2) probably my more significant criticism, the lighting in the room was really not very good and the room felt much too dim. I would suggest to the hotel that it think about upgrading its rooms to provide for better lighting. I happened to visit a colleague at another nearby hotel and was struck by how much more brightly lit his room was (I believe with use of track lighting) in comparison with my room at the Alma, which may have been slightly nicer in other respects. 

There is a breakfast buffet for 25 Euro, with a selection of cooked dishes available at no further charge. The quality of the food was fairly good, but it is not really worth such a high price despite the convenience.

If I were to stay in the area again I would consoider the Alma but might consider an area hotel of similar quality without the issue of overly-dim room lighting, although this would depend on how much time I expected to stay in the room. On this visit I needed to do a fair amount of work in the room and so the dim lighting was a bit of a problem.",4,2016,04,17
40,5 star luxury,"It's taken me a while to review the hotel but it's an amazing place, very cool.  Extremely central and just off Passeig de Gracia.  Lovely garden as well.
Rooms were spacious for a city centre hotel.  Hotel staff very accommodating and happy to provide recommendations/organise bookings etc.
Love the fingerprint entry to the rooms! Saves carrying around bulky keys/cards or running the risk of forgetting your key! 
We stayed in Aug 15, Barcelona is such a great city and would return in a heartbeat but would come back either spring or autumn.  I was eaten alive by mosquitoes despite using repellent.  They love the Irish blood apparently :o)",5,2016,04,16
40,Brilliant,"Lovely hotel, stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. Warm welcome on arrival and everything explained to us including recommendations on where to eat. Cases were taken to our room whilst we checked in. Lovely quiet room overlooking the garden, although not much of a view, but was a good size. Complementary mini fridge would have liked tea making facility in the room. Having read other reviews re special occasions was a little disappointed the hotel did not acknowledge our special day, even though we had advised them of our anniversary. The Alma is central  to lots of attractions, the hop on/off bus just around the corner and we would return to this hotel if we revisit Barcelona.

40,Excellent ,"Stayed two nights in the hotel in April and was very impressed. The rooms are a good size with everything in them that you need. We had a room facing the garden which was lovely and also very quiet at night. Service from staff great, the garden is lovely to sit in and have coffee, we never ate at the hotel but i can imagine it would be nice to. The hotel is located on the main shopping street and is close to many of the main attractions in Barcelona. We had a fantastic time in the city and the Alma hotel played a major part in making it a good break. ",5,2016,04,15
40,Very cool & well located away from the crowds ,"We have really enjoyed all aspects of this ultra cool hotel ! Well almost ... Would have been better if they would have thrown in breakfast especially given we had an expensive room type . 
However , the room is large with a beautiful aspect , very comfortable bed & bedding , large & well appointmented bathroom. 
Great bar & music at night ! 
Very helpful staff !",5,2016,04,14
40,Great place to stay for our silver wedding anniversary; a real treat!,Great customer service and friendly accommodating staff. Ideally suited for three of the main Gaudi attractions which are in walking distance. Metro very nearby as well the upmarket designer shops. Decor throughout the hotel is beautiful and there is great attention to detail. The staff had a good understanding of my dietary needs (coeliac) and there was a range of food I could eat or the kitchen would adapt. Beautiful 'secret' garden to relax in after a day's sightseeing.,5,2016,04,10
40,5* in top location,"On arrival met by concierge bags whisked to room. Sat down to check in and welcomed with a glass of cava. First sentence was we have upgraded you from standard to superior room. Followed by comprehensive information about the hotel finger print identification for room entry and recommendations for places of interest and places that are not great value. The hotel is minimalist boutique with a low lighting theme throughout. We were on the 5th floor overlooking the courtyard with a view of gaudi's rooftop wallnut whips at La padreda ( 100 yards away). The room was fantastic with queen bed, small writing table, walk in shower, seperate WC and a screen to seperate the vanity area. There is a bar and seperate dining area with a central point to relax. The minibar is stocked every day with water,jucies, canned beer and soft drinks. The bedding is changed every day and room refreshed. The location is perfect for the whole city being in a very affluent area. The drinks from the bar are priced accordingly €15 for a cocktail and a bottled beer befitting a high end hotel. The only small issue is that the wi fi was a little bit hit and miss ( not sure if it was because of where we were situated). Overall this is a massive recommend. Many thanks to all staff for the unforgetable experience.",5,2016,04,09
40,Amazing Hotel!,"Stayed here multiple times and I have to admit that it really is a great hotel. Here are some points, which in our opinion make the hotel this great. 

- Location: The hotel is located right next to the ""high end"" area of Barcelona, where all the nice shops and restaurants are located in. Although the hotel is located next to a busy street it is not noisy at all. 
- Staff: The staff is very friendly, elegant, and sophisticated. They know how to there job very well, and are very professional. 
- Garden Area: The outside garden area is something very special. It is quiet, beautiful, and a perfect place to relax. 
- Breakfast: The breakfast is DELICIOUS the churros are very good, as well as the rest of the breakfast. Every morning you can see the (managers or owners?) come into the breakfast buffet and make sure everything is perfect. You can see their dedication to make the hotel great. 
- The lobby, although small, is very elegant .
- The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated. The wooden feel to them are really great, (wooden floors, wooden ceiling).  They also include Bulgari products, which smell amazing. Further, the mini bar is free, which is a nice touch. Definitely stay in the executive room!

All in all the hotel, is a classy five star luxury hotel.",5,2016,04,07
40,Mikeandlesleyo,"We stayed at the Alma over Easter staying 3 nights. We were not disappointed. This is a fantastic hotel with outstanding customer service, attentive staff and ideal location.

The hotel is situated on Cala Mallorca ( the same street as the Sagrada Familia which is only about a 20-30 minute walk).

Much closer are Casa Mila (also known as La Pededra) which is about 100 metres away and Casa Batlo which is about 300 metres away.

There are numerous tapas bars and restaurants nearby along with coffee shops so you are not spoilt for choice.

The hotel price includes a free mini bar which is replenished daily with water, natural fruit drinks, Coke and two lagers. I might suggest the hotel also offered wine as well for my wife but still it is a great bonus.

The hotel is very contemporary in design, the pool, spa and gym are great as is the food in the hotel restaurant. 

We are definitely returning to this hotel which has extremely quiet rooms with a second internal door to close out the minimal noise from the corridor. ",5,2016,04,07
40,Excellent day out ,"Excellent trip out on the boat; driving out and then you stop to have a swim in the sea. Staff are beyond fantastic making sure you're okay, providing you with more drinks or food. You can have a drive of the boat if you want too. It's a perfect day out away from the main attractions of Benidorm. Thank you to Matt and Raf for all their attention and making the day so lovely. ",5,2016,04,06
40,"Special Hotel, Fabulous Stay","This hotel is so much more than we expected. Elegant yet very friendly, professional, chic, innovative (got into rooms via fingerprint), quiet, lovely. Would stay here again without question. An absolutely stunning design makes this a boutique hotel of exceptional style. We never ate in the restaurant, but we did use the spa, and it was delightful. This is a real find, and in an excellent area of town for tourists. Good restaurants nearby, easy walk to Sagrada Familia, Gaudi houses, shopping, pretty much anything you want to fully enjoy the Barcelona experience.",5,2016,04,03
40,Great Hotel with perfect location!,"We stayed at the Alma last week for three nights. 

The staff was perfect- attentive and helpful. Took their time answering all our questions and suggesting amazing spots for dinner and tapas. They helped with tickets to the Familia Sagrada and the Pedrera and the Ballit house. Glad they gave us this guidance because a new city can be overwhelming and confusing as a tourist.

The hotel was very modern and clean. After seeing all the beautiful and overwhelmingly designed Gaudi' sights- it was refreshing to come back to a neat and modern refuge. :)

Location is great because the main shopping areas are nearby. And its walking distance to many sights- Gothic quarter, Catulunya square, Pedreras, Ballit house and more. Also the Hop on Hop off bus stop is a block away- the hotel bought our tickets so we didnt have to buy on the bus. 

The hotel had dark mood lighting- that is the only negative we found lolol. 

Hope you enjoy your stay in Barcelona- its a beautiful and welcoming city.....",4,2016,03,31
40,Home away from home,"Very friendly place. Felt like we moved to our second home. The  hotel is close to a number of attractions, many of them in walking distance. Transport facilities are close by; Metro is 5 minutes walk from where you can travel to most places including the airport. Bus stop is 3 minutes away, and yu can take the hop-on, hop-off bus from there.",5,2016,03,31
40,Absolutely amazing hotel,"Like all the reviews say, Alma Barcelona is an amazing place.   The staff, the design, the room and the location are all top notch.    Additionally, the bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.",5,2016,03,29
40,Hidden Luxury,"Spent a couple of days with the family in Alma. A rather long check-in process is made pleasant by a complementary drink whilst going through the motions.
Nice feature is the option of finger-print access to your room and Spa/Gym/Pool. Saves you having to carry a key-card. Very neat. However, I fear that our family fingerprints will remain on file in some database. You never know.
The hotel is not very big and has an easy layout. The room is great and the shower in the bathroom is superb. Materials are high quality and the complimentary minibar had a decent selection of drinks.
Internet was fast but during our stay, the hotel was relatively quiet. The Garden is a little hidden treasure with excellent service from staff. Valet parking was efficient and all personnel was very friendly and competent. I recommend for both business or leisure.",5,2016,03,26
40,Wonderful Botique Hotel,"We spent 3 nights at the Alma and will stay longer next visit to this wonderful city. The staff was personal and very helpful. Breakfast was delicious and so was dinner. Very clean, though room was on the smaller side. We backed to Courtyard, which was very quiet. In the Hub of Barcelona with easy access to all the Highlights and double decker bus which is a must when sightseeing in the city. We would definitely visit again.",5,2016,03,23
40,"Stylish, quiet luxury retreat","Tucked away from the hustle and bustle, The Alma is a delight. The reception, prosecco on arrival and the stylish lobby, exceptional rooms and most of all quiet. The guys at the bar make a mean cocktail, the breakfast buffet and cooked offer very tasteful if a little expensive at €50 for 2. The only downside and its most certainly not the hotel is the horrible, rude, aggressive Barcelona taxi drivers, sadly the Spanish ones. I'd walk. The hotel more than made up for it with measured, calm but highly attentive luxury service. Thoroughly recommended. ",5,2016,03,23
40,Bahram Bayzaie,"All about the hotel was excellent. Very friendly, efficient and helpful staff, very good restaurant, beautiful and comfortable room, very good location. The atmosphere was however a little gloomy! Also the choice in the buffet breakfast was not extensive. ",5,2016,03,21
40,Perfect hotel and service,"Could not recommend this hotel more. Great location. Fantastic stsff. The breakfast buffet was plentiful, fresh and with lots of options. A great location for visiting all the cities main sites and attractions.

40,Great location and Service,"Located in heart of the fun, this hotel is great.  Super attentive staff, plentiful breakfast, cozy bar open late, comfy outdoor area.  Room was nice, HVAC a little tough to adjust, no iron (12 to press a shirt).  Heartily recommended!",5,2016,03,07
40,STYLISH!,"We did not expect any particularly special experience before staying here.  It was recommended and arranged by our travel agency as we requested some place nice and near the city centre.  

The location is perfect!  There is  louis vuitton shop at the corner which is like 59 steps away.  Further, the sight-seeing bus stop, La Pedrera is right on the next alley. 

The good impressions started right when we arrived.  The staff was enthusiastic and very helpful.  Room is very specious with a (we thought quite) over-sized toilet.  It is as big as the bathroom, which, creatively, without a door!  The room is controlled by guest finger-prints (which is a seriously problematic for me as I do not have finger-prints)!  It is an option, you can still choose traditional style, I suppose.

Our room right facing right to the Casa Milà.  Very lucky!

Breakfast is really nice, eggs and sandwich menu with wide selections  of breads, sweets and fruits.  

The only minor aspect of this hotel is the light which does seem to be too little everywhere especially inside the elevator.  But I guess it is the concept design(?).

We would definitely stay here again if (or when) we go back to Barcelona.",4,2016,03,06
40,Great Hotel very good located,"It was a very warm welcome, they really have an excellent staff, wether at the reception, at the restaurant or in the night at the bar, each one of them, they do a perfect job! Accidentally I booked he room nice on booking.com, they managed to cancel it, thank you, Quentin!
The rooms were very comfortable, nice design, heavy oak and white marble, but not overdone, rather minimalistic. High quality products in the bathroom from Malin+Goetz, probably the best natural products you can find in a hotel. Bed more than comfortable. All in all was a very nice stay. The only thing was, I excepted the Spa more generously. We were lucky we were first at the Spa but a few guests came after us & left since they had no space to lay down. It was not very pleasant for us either. We didn't visit the Spa a second time just to not make a similar experience.",4,2016,03,01
40,secret tip for best stay in Barcelona,"Alma hotel is indeed the exression of indulging  and caring for your soul. The rooms are in a modern style,but also very cosy and functional ( even a pc plug on the toilet). The cleanliness is anyway great. The service is always aware of you in a incredible nice and not penetrant manor. And the breakfast is just only a dream with a very high quality of food and a variety of specialities, you will hardly find again in any other hotel. So just all great",5,2016,02,29
40,Probably one of my favourite hotels,"The design and decor in this hotel is absolutely beautiful.  They have a relaxing spa as well as lovely products by Bulgari to use while in your hotel room.  The food was lovely and although I had a terrible flu while staying at this hotel, the staff did the most they could, including bringing hot toddy in the middle of the night, to make me as comfortable as possible.    This may be my favourite hotel.",5,2016,02,28
40,A great boutique hotel,A very good hotel in a great location with excellent amenities. I booked the Alma for a few days based on other reviews and was very impressed with the staff and their attention to detail. There was only one very minor point which an annoying barman who really was not very good at his job. Everything thing else including the spa was very high quality and made the stay even better than expected.,5,2016,02,21
40,Lovely hotel and well located,"This is a really nice hotel, located right in the good part of the city. A short walk to La Rambla, the port and Sagrada Familia. 

This is a 5 star hotel but I was disappointed with the overall appearance. This is just my opinion but for me the minimalist look is just a little too sparse and devoid of warmth. The room had no pictures or paintings, one uncomfortable chair, one very uncomfortable typist chair and a small desk on wheels that moved every time you leaned in it??? The bathroom lacked a towel rail ( where does one put a damp towel after use ready for the morning - on the floor?) there are no chest of drawers in the room.  The bed however was very comfortable. 

The public rooms are similarly sparse of any frills. The staff were excellent, helpful and attentive. Breakfast is full continental at €25 per person and nothing else it would appear is available. Just outside though there are lots of places for a fab breakfast at a quarter of the price. 

Having said all that I would go back.

It was great to be treated so well after such a long flight. If I went back to Barcelona, I would stay at this hotel again with pleasure.",5,2016,02,21
40,Best option by far in Barcelona,This is one of the best places one can stay in Barcelona (and I am from Barcelona myself). I have come many times both for drinks at the terrace and meals at the restaurant and its pure joy to be here. The decoration is exquisite trying to maintain the feeling of a traditional building in Barcelona but with a modern touch and understated luxury. The service is impeccable and respectful. And the location is just unbeatable if you are looking to do some shopping and sightseeing. I wished I could give it 6 starts if it was possible.,5,2016,02,19
40,Excellent hotel with even better service,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. Everything about it was just wonderful:
- location was super convenient for what I needed to do and was able to avoid taking public transportation or taxis anywhere
- staff is incredibly nice and helpful. Any and all requests were responded to quickly
- free wifi. Now, most hotels that provide free wifi give you super slow speed wifi and has an additional option to upgrade to a faster one. Not here. Alma's free wifi was as fast as the one I have at home. This made working super easy (maybe that was a bad thing?)
- Room. We had a view of the garden and tons of space inside for two medium/large suitcases. We did not have to walk around each other and had plenty of space in the bathroom for all my junk. 
- most bathroom essentials were provided (soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion). There were no cotton pads of Q tips but then most hotels don't seem to offer those these days anymore
- we did not get to enjoy the restaurant in the lobby but it looked very nice and would plan that into my trip on my next visit

This hotel uses your fingerprint to access your room. Alternatively they can give you an old traditional key to open your door. I don't know how the fingerprint plays into security and privacy but do keep in mind you can ask to use the key instead.

The only comment I'd like to make is their pillows. Their pillows are VERY VERY flat. So flat to the point that I gave my husband ones of mine so he's using three, and I had to put a folded bathrobe underneath them all to give it some volume. 

Oh how did I forget. This is the first hotel I've stayed at that gives you TWO comforters for the bed so no fighting over a large comforter that my husband may pull all the way to his side. That was a pleasant surprise.

I will definitely stay here again when I come back.",5,2016,02,16
40,Inspirational Experience,"Perfect location for a weekend get-away. The hotel associates really care about you and looking into all possibilities to make your stay unforgettable. What a great experience and personal touch guaranteed. 

Would you recommend Hotel Alma? Yes, absolutely!",5,2016,02,15
40,Perfection and elegance,"Very nice hotel, beautiful room, perfect breakfast.
We stay only one night but it was great. I already stayed one week last year.
The staff was great and helpful.
The location of the hotel is very nice, with nice shops and restaurants.",5,2016,02,14
40,Chic Barcelona,"Very nice Hotel in a fantastic neighborhood for the best shopping in Barcelona.
The decor is minimalist and tasteful, the rooms are big and airy. I chose a room facing the courtyard because I like quite rooms. I enjoyed everything, also the music playing from the outdoor bar, a nice selection of jazz, Brazilian and classy melodies.
I was disappointed by the service tough: there was no concierge service at 7pm so I asked the front desk if they could order some pasta for me since there wasn't any on the room service menu, and I just wanted to dine in after a long work day. There was an Italian restaurant right across the street, and the girl didn't even offer to find out if they could delivery the food for me, neither to get me some pasta from the hotel restaurant (since I discover later that it was on their menu). This is not definitively a 5 star hotel service.
I had beg the lady to call the restaurant for me and to place an order, and I had to pick it up myself. This was unpleasent.",4,2016,02,12
40,"Comfortable excellent service, and in a perfect location","We arrived at the Alma from AMdrid and were very happy with the level of service & the standard of the facility . The room which was facing the street was roomy and  had a lovely bathroom. The breakfast was excellent as was the service , and we has a couple of meals at the restaurant & Tapas bar which were more than acceptable.
The only criticism is that, as with many of these trendy hotels, the  rooms are so dark.
Put in a few more lights guys!
The pools was 18m in length, but the gym was  basic",5,2016,02,05
40,Highlight of our trip to Europe,"Spent three nights in the Hotel. The amazing staff managed to accommodate our needs after a delayed flight in Atlanta. Our room was ready for us in the middle of the night and a perfect welcome drink in the lobby.
Perfect location. 
Make sure you spend some time in the backyard and have a beer at the outside bar.
Staff fluent in Spanish (of course), English and Portuguese.",5,2016,01,28
40,"Stylish Luxury, Great Showers and Staff","So you remember the things that standout. We had been staying in a cheap apartment (that was nice) and came here to spend a few days and the overhead showers were a huge win. The place is very stylish and comfortable with all sorts of sexy mod cons like fingerprint locks (if you want) but, as always, it is the staff that make a place and they were friendly, helpful and gave good dining advice.

One Tip: The hotel is right on the street so if you are arriving by car phone on approach and be willing to pull up and deal with a few horns, then hand the problem over to the helpful Alma team - part of the character of inner city hotels.

Note: Does have a rooftop bar but not open in winter - courtyard bar very nice though.",5,2016,01,17
40,Amazing hotel,"I've never written a review on TA but felt a need to after our stay at Alma.  My wife and I enjoyed everything about this hotel.  We travel frequently globally and thought that Alma in particular stuck out positively vs many other accommodations in other locations.  The staff was a primary reason for my positive review.  They helped us on numerous items from dinner reservations to futbol tickets to attraction visits.  We also enjoyed the modern yet classic feel to the decor.  Food at the restaurant was excellent for breakfast, dinner or just a snack.  Rooms were comfortable and overhead large shower was a plus.  Hands down, I will stay at Alma when I return to Barca.",5,2016,01,10
40,End of the year at Alma Barcelona,"My husband and I had an amazing experience at Alma Hotel in Barcelona! The personnel is customer oriented, always willing to help you and to solve problems. Excellent food and restaurant. Fantastic room!
We want to do the experience again!",5,2016,01,10
40,Great food and location!,"The service and room were really good. The food was amazing, we had the New Year's Day brunch and I wished I had an extra stomach! The spa is nice and not busy but they use the finger print locking system there too and while looking for water I got lock out as the system stop working and had to go all the way to reception wearing just my bathing suit! Not cool! They should have a phone by the spa entrance so you can call them instead of embarrassing making me go to them. 
Great garden!",4,2016,01,10
40,Mixed.  Not 5 star,"Location,  comfortable bed,  decent bathroom are good and the design is aesthetically pleasing. 
But the service is not 5 star. Free minibar but offering sugary drinks,  nothing of quality, and no tea/coffee. 
Phone system of low quality,  WiFi fiddly to access. 
Breakfast wrongly priced,  you can get better for 5 euro within 3 minutes  walk and 3 minutes is the minimum before their f&b staff end their own conversation and think about customers.  
Overall,  you get the sense staff have been told to offer good service by people who don't know what good service is. 
Location will keep this hotel in business but services don't justify the 5 star rating.  ",3,2016,01,09
40,Chic Barcelona,Fashionable crowd and chic design. Rooms were spacious and beautifully designed. Staff was impressive and matched ambience of hotel. Food was very good. The garden is a huge plus and the location cannot be better virtually on passeig de gracia facing the LV store. I highly recommend it if you stay in Barcelona,4,2016,01,09
40,Great Hotel but noisy room,"Loved the hotel, the ambiance, the service. Unfortunately our room # 213 was right on top of an extremely busy street. The joke was that we got the real street experience since the noise was almost as being outside. I think for junior suites and suites since you are paying  more the emphasis should be to make the experience as nice as possible and here the noise was just a little bit too much. The rest of the Hotel was perfect.",4,2016,01,05
40,A good hotel with some quirky bits...,"Excellent location, it must be one of the best in Barcelona.  The staff are all very friendly and willing to help you on anything.  The front desk staff are both check in staff and concierges which can mean that you sometimes have to wait a bit for things but generally they are quite efficient.  Great spa facilities which are really worth spending sometime in and throughout the festive season they had a bit of evening live music which suited the ambiance very well. The rooms are spacious and well maintained with a free mini bar (a few beers, soft drinks, juices and water).

The negatives are not having a coffee making facility in your room which for a 5 star hotel I don't think is at all acceptable.  The room is exceptionally dark with all the lights however the bathroom and change area is well lit.  The only mirror in the unit above the basin has 2 bright globes shining back at you which means you really cannot see much in the mirror.  No full length mirror at all in this room, also a must for a 5 star.  We were positioned closest to the elevators despite having requested a quieter room however there are far louder hotels than this one.

The final big negative was the lack in communication among the hotel staff.  We inquired for New Years eve at the bar, knowing that the restaurant was having a set menu however we wanted to be with the live band in the bar, not in the restaurant.  We were told by the main barman that the bar was not available to be booked, however the usual tables will be available on a first come first serve basis and the usual Tapas will be available to order.  He looked forward to welcoming us.  We decided this would work for us on New Years eve and arrived fairly early to get a table only to find that most of the bar tables had been laid for the restaurant and that the band was positioned elsewhere.  On top of this the Tapas was not available.  We questioned the same main barman and he seemed to think that he had only just found out.  This really put a spanner in the works for us and our friends who joined us!  A great night to be messed around...",3,2016,01,04
40,Perfect hotel in Barcelona,My second time in this excelentlly well located Hotel 25 mts away from Passeig de Gracia. Excellent staff and service and elegant but cozy room with all the amenities. Wonderful and generous breakfast and excellent food in general. Just do not miss is it!,5,2016,01,02
40,Great coolz hip understated beauty,"Like this hotel
Location is at the p d gracia (quieter side as compared to las ramblas on the other side

If you into high end brand hunting, stay here. LV is in front of your doorstep, almost literally.

If you into visiting casa mila and casa batlo. These 2 are stones throw away from the hotel.

Turn down service is good

Room is big and clean

Charming garden behind the restaurant

40,Modern Bliss,"A friend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in October and it was perfection!  We splurged on the executive suite and it was huge!  The sheets and towels were of very high quality and the bed so comfortable you didn't want to leave it!  Our room was on the first floor facing the street and were worried it would be noisy but we had no issues - a sign of good quality soundproofing and windows.  The courtyard is lovely and the perfect place to a cava or cocktail.  We took advantage of the turkish bath and steam room in the basement which was a great way to relax and rejuvenate after hours of sightseeing around Barcelona.  The location is in a chic, upscale neighborhood and close to a couple Gaudi building and walking distance to the Segrada Familia and the Barrio Gothique.  The staff was very professional and helpful and all spoke excellent English. We appreciated the complentary water and juices as well as the high quality toiletries.  We considered a few hotels in the area and are so glad to have booked the Alma.",5,2015,12,15
40,Perfect location,"The Alma is modern and fresh with an extremely knowledgeable staff with tips for restaurants etc. Located in the shopping district; very quiet and less crowded than Las Ramblas, but close to great shops, tapas, and transportation.  The food is wonderful, but I think there should be complimentary coffee, croissants for the price of the room. A most enjoyable atmosphere, but not for those who don't like modern and dark interior. Outdoor spaces, lovely.  Rooms were large and comfortable! Made our visit to Barcelona memorable. Superior service.  The dark lobby and steps could be hazardous for those with poor vision or mobility issues.

It is a well situated hotel! very closer to everything in the city! they have good staff! very professiona & always smiling! they served us very good breakfasts!

40,Outstanding hotel,This hotel is run with attention to the smallest detail. Rooms are incredibly comfortable and the restaurant is amazing! The best food in Barcelona. Well done to the staff that works at Alma Barcelona. The location is also perfect. Next time that I visit the city I am sure where I will stay. ,5,2015,12,06

40,"Quiet, comfortable and amazing location","I stayed here on biz 2 years ago for a brief visit and came back as couple to explore Barcelona for three nights. We were very pleased with everything. It's not overly busy and bustling, just right. The staff are very helpful and the room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. We had a quiet (very large) courtyard view with even sone of the Gaudi statues on the rooftop of La Pedrera visible. Perfect!",5,2015,11,21
40,Holiday,"Knowledgable staff, polite, courteous, efficient and always ready to assist with a smile. The hotel is perfectly located central to all main attractions and restaurants the city has to offer. Bed was very comfortable and hotel was clean and contemporary. Top rating from us. Well deserved are its 5 stars. ",5,2015,11,21
40,happy to wake up at the Alma,"This boutique property impressed me from check-in to checkout.
Personalized attention, and a soothing lounge and breakfast spot
with fresh fare and fine service. One suggestion for improvent: the wood
floors, while nice in an architectural/design sense, need some warmth for walking and 
textural interest when appointments are stark.",4,2015,11,17
40,Another wonderful stay at the Alma Hotel Barcelona,"This was my second visit to the Hotel Alma Barcelona and because I was so impressed with my stay last year, I decided to return when I came back on a holiday this year with my son. 

Both of our Grand Deluxe rooms were excellent and well appointed and we both agreed as to how comfortable the beds were. The amenitites supplied in the bathroom were of a very high calibre.
 
The breakfast staff and the bar staff in the evening were always professional and courteous. 
Every member of the front desk could not be more helpful in supplying us with information based on any enquires we had. They organised tours for us and took payments at the hotel to save us having to queue anywhere.
My 23 year old son was especially delighted that staff were able to help him out with venues and places to go to that were suitable for his age. As a result, at the end of our three week trip to four different countries, he picked Barcelona and the Alma as one of the best experiences he had. 
As per my trip last year,  I cannot speak more highly of the staff that are employed at this hotel. A big thank you to the Alma Hotel and all it's staff for making our stay in Barcelona so memorable.",5,2015,11,15
40,My Personal Favorite in Barcelona,"The help was attentive from the moment of check in.  We arrived after a tour of Barcelona upon debarking a cruise.  Provided a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice while checking in. What a perfect place to relax.  Our room wasn't ready but they quickly made one up while we relaxed in the outside courtyard with a glass of wine.  Free mini bar with water, soft drinks and beer....who ever heard of that?  Just one clue as to their special touches.  They have a pool and spa and free wifi.  A rooftop bar that looks on one of the Gaudi creations. The rooms were spacious and modern.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet...it was pricey but I think it was the best hotel breakfast buffet I've had.  The fresh goat or sheep cheese wrapped in cheese cloth and marmalade was unbelievable so soft and mild in flavor.  Everything was genuinely Spanish.  Around the corner from Passeig de Gracia.   Staff was superb and try as I might I can't think of any criticism.",5,2015,11,15
40,Excellent location!,"Walking distance from many Gaudi-esque buildings, and some wonderful contemporary design on the inside, this is a great hotel for walking around. La Sagrada Familia was a 10 minute walk from here! The breakfast was one of the best we had in Spain!",5,2015,11,13
40,Lovely stay and helpful staff,"Alma hotel is lovely. Stayed here on a short visit to the city with a friend. Brilliant location, near some good shops. Every member of staff at the hotel were very helpful and gave us some great recommendations, like the lovely cocktail bar - Boca Chica. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was closed in early October, so did not get to see the views over the city. The finger print recognition system for room entry was also great. I can't comment on the swimming pool or spa facilities as we didn't get time to use them. Overall a great stay.",5,2015,11,13
40,Superb Boutique Hotel,"We booked here for our final night in Barcelona and were not disappointed. The hotel is stunning right from being offered a glass of Cava on check in, to modern features such as finger print recognition to enter your room. 

The walk to the harbour area is around 30 minutes at a leisurely pace.

The decoration is fairly dark around the guest floors but I like that styling so no issues there. 

The hotel has a nice little spa in the basement with a small pool, sauna, steam room and a basic gym facility. All you need for an hours wind down.

The reception were even able to loan me an iPhone charger for a couple of hours. 

Pricey yes, but worth it. I would return.",5,2015,11,10
40,wonderful boutique hotel,"The Alama Barcelona is a superb hotel. The staff was excellent, great location and most comfortable beds!! Definitely recommend this wonderful hotel. The concierge, Elizabeth was most helpful and answered all of our requests in a very timely manner.",5,2015,11,03
40,The best hotel in Barcelona ,This is the 4th hotel I have stayed in Barcelona and the best by a mile-and that includes the famous W hotel. Excellent service from all staff. Beautiful rooms in muted colours and huge bathrooms with bvlgari products. Location is fantastic for the centre of Barcelona. The only negative/breakfast is very expensive at €25 per person but there are plenty of bars nearby. ,5,2015,11,03
40,Shoooooooo don't tell- 5 star heaven,"So if you want a blissful Barcelona - go Alma mad. so it's slap bang in a the urban middle- Passaic de Graccia a minute away, the Alma is beautifully under stated- all soaring vista's and lots of eau de nil flat matts. Rooms are well proportioned and the service level excellent - all Buvgaria- with walk in showers. service is quietly superb- best hotel in Barcelona.",5,2015,11,02
40,The most wonderful hotel in Barcelona,"I love this hotel! Have been there four times so far. Attentive staff, elegant modern decor, spacious and comfortable rooms (and you don't have a key - they take your fingerprint and that opens the door). Excellent bathrooms.",5,2015,11,02
40,Boutique hotel in Barcelona,"Nice hotel in a great location. The rooms are quieter overlooking the courtyard.

Staff are very friendly if a little disorganised. Clean with decent food.

Interesting one off events with music. 

Unusually no facility for Bluetooth music in the room but with charging options for apple appliances.

",4,2015,11,01
40,"Elegant surroundings, artsy decor and fine food","Our room was large and comfortable with room to sit, write, read and rest.  We had a room overlooking the courtyard which meant it was quiet.  The amenities were superb.  The staff, from the dining room to the front desk, were excellent, helpful with suggestions and advice.  Importantly the hotel's location is great - public transport, walking to shops and restaurants, wide boulevards and Gaudi is right nearby.  I would return in a heartbeat.",5,2015,10,30
40,Superb hotel,"Perfectly located, spacious rooms with real 'grandeur', extremely friendly staff, great combination of modern design and original building, one of the very best breakfasts ever (all high quality local products and home made stuff)",5,2015,10,28
40,Would move in tomorrow,"Travel a lot and am quite fussy, especially when staying for a week as we did (our first holiday without kids in almost 20 years).
But there was so much to really like and admire about the Alma: comfort, friendly and helpful staff, relaxing atmosphere (despite hotel being full), fabulous breakfast, superb location (but still very quiet room) and a style that made us feel we were in Spain, not some generic hotel chain. Definitely worth the price.
A kettle in the room to make tea and coffee would be nice.
With any luck, we will get to stay there again soon.",5,2015,10,26
40,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"I was in awe when we checked into our suite at the Hotel Alma..
Met at reception with an icy cold glass of Cava, they checked us in quickly and we off to sleep off some jet lag in what had to be the most amazing hotel room I have been in, in a very long time.

The sheets devine, the room, huge, the free mini bar..the Bulgari hair and skin products, all made for a delightful stay in Barcelona.

There is a turkish pool, sauna, steam room and exercise room that is a real treat after a long day of touring.

A lovely garden bar, and amazing attentive service made this one of the best stays of a  one month trip to Europe...I will never stay at any other hotel in BCN..Thank You",5,2015,10,25
40,"A good hotel with key location in center of Catalonia, Barcelona","I stayed with my wife in Alma hotel for 5 nights in October. Our room was in 3rd floor. It was a grand deluxe double bed room without noise, very clean, spacious and with a view of the hotel's backyard garden and restaurant. The breakfast and food in restaurant was of very limited menu and moderate quality. The overall atmosphere of hotel was rather dark. The hotel's location is its key advantage with regard to the major touristic attractions of Barcelona. All of its faults are compensated by it. I will stay in my next visit to Barcelona in Alma hotel.",5,2015,10,24
40,Expensive for what it offers,"We booked an executive suite online, but on going into the room there was a terrible smell of drains coming from the bathroom and the wooden shutters did nothing to shut out the noise from the busy main road outside. We moved to a smaller room which was a lot quieter and cheaper. Check in staff very helpful. Breakfast expensive at 25 euros each and disappointing - dry bread, dry chorizos, not much fruit, over zealous staff whipping cutlery and crockery away before we barely put them down. Great location for walking straight out to the Passeig de Gracia. Wouldn't stay here again.",3,2015,10,24
40,Disappointing for the Price,"A very similar experience to Waltercorgi on 21 October. Just returned from Barcelona and spent 3 nights at the Alma:

The good:
Location just off Passeig de Gracia, near The Pedrera, was excellent for food, drinks, buses and shops. Reception - prompt and efficient. Spotlessly clean but original room stank of drains - more later. Room was well appointed but never 5 star
Bottle of Cava on arrival was a nice touch but free mini bar consisted of 2 cans of lager and soft drinks. Moved rooms with no fuss. Free wifi.
The bad:
Original room (401) was a suite with the most foul stench coming from the bathroom and was incredibly noisy even with the shutters closed. Moved to a standard room which was much smaller and not as well appointed but no stench and no noise since overlooking the garden. Tried breakfast but was awful at 25 euros each with hardly any fruit or cooked food choices. We took breakfast in cafes nearby for 6-10 euros. Avoided the bar - no one there and ridiculous prices. No privacy in bathroom and toilet located in different room to wash basin.

Not 5 star and certainly not worth the money.",3,2015,10,24
40,LOVELY and CONVENIENT,"We spent four nights at this lovely hotel.  We arrived very early, as we came from a cruise to Barcelona - and they offered us a welcome cup of coffee while they verified that we would be able to check in immediately.  GREAT!  The room overlooked the street, and was very spacious.  I set up my computer at their desk, and enjoyed the English news on TV (one set on either side of the dividing wall between the living area and bedroom).  I found storage for all our stuff - very helpful not only during our stay but when I had to repack for our flight home.

We did find the breakfast much too expensive, but found a nice coffee shop nearby at Casa Mila.  I am sorry we were so tired after dinner that we didn't get to enjoy drinks on their rooftop - which looked lovely.

The bathroom and amenities were lovely.  I really enjoyed the long tub, and love the shower where you could set the temperature you preferred.  They also provided a lovely private WC with bidet.  and soft cotton robes for relaxing! 

We have trouble with long walks as we get older, and loved the convenience of the hotel's location.  Short walks to Casa Mila and Casa Battlo - where I used pre-purchased tour tickets.  Also very close to the bus lines which we used to both tour the city (Gray Line) and - with a four-day pass - to go to Barcelonetta area for wonderful seafood meals.  We also booked nearby restaurants for delicious and convenient dinners each night of our stay.  

One item I really appreciated was using your fingertip to get entry to the room - NO keys needed!  Overall, we really enjoyed staying at this friendly, clean hotel for the end of our two-week trip to Europe.",5,2015,10,21
40,Good hotel but not truly five star & not worth the price,"We stayed here for 4 nights. We were attracted by the promise of sound proof rooms but that proved to be misleading in terms of the expensive suite we booked. After some fuss, we were transferred to a standard room at only a slightly lower cost with open bathroom. Was told we had the best room in the place - hard to believe & if true, I'd hate to see the worst. We never ate in the hotel apart from a few drinks at the bar. We would have liked to order room service for breakfast but none was available until 11 am. Hotel new but already showing signs of wear & poor workmanship such as buckling timber floor & unfinished areas around tiling. We had problems with drain smells repeatedly. Problem was investigated by hotel but told didn't exist. This hotel does not meet the standards of true 5 star hotels & is expensive.",4,2015,10,21
40,Perfect,"This hotel is fantastic.  I'm torn, because I don't want to reveal how truly great this hotel is and then not be able to secure a room when I visit Barcelona.  On the other hand, I feel a duty to disclose because I have selfishly relied on others who have been kind enough to take the time to post their reviews on this site.  So with a great deal of trepidation, I'm forced out of a sense of guilt, to tell you this is one great hotel that you will not be disappointed if you make it your place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,10,20
40,First class,"I am so glad I chose this hotel. I have stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo which I always use as a benchmark for good service and The Alma is definitely as good. We stayed in a suite which was comfortable, spacious and spotlessly clean. All the staff we encountered were helpful and were keen to interact and offer suggestions on where to visit and where to avoid! The breakfast was a real treat and others have commented it was expensive, but for the quality I thought it was well worth it. All in all, a perfect stay and I will return next year to explore the city in more detail.",5,2015,10,19
40,Wonderful hotel,"For some  reason we were upgraded to the Alma Suite and I have to say it was the most spacious, well designed hotel room I have had the pleasure to meet.  The staff was courteous, polite, expeditious and appropriate. The location is ideal.  All in all, the stay at the Alma was outstanding and I would highly recommend it to all who are visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,10,18
40,WOW!,"Rarely do you book a hotel and room that is perfect, but The Alma is the one. Unfortunately we were there only one night, but the front desk was organized, staff friendly, the twin room gorgeous, down comforters luxurious, the complimentary Cava delicious, the garden enhanting, and the spa incredible...spa pool, steam room, sauna, fancy showers. Location perfect. Didn't have breakfast due to early flight...but when I go back to Barcelona, The Alma will be my top pick.

Only issue we had was the fingerprint room locking system didn't work too well...advise you choose the key option instead.",5,2015,10,17
40,Loved it,"It was the best hotel experience we had among 9 hotels we stayed in our  15 days vacation. Besides to the prime location, pristine rooms and common areas, the staff are courteous, they let us check into one of the rooms before hour. It was really delightful after a long trip from SFO. I will definitely stayed again at Alma.",5,2015,10,15
40,Elegant Hotel,"Spectacular location, wonderful service from concierge and doormen, excellent food especially breakfast, gorgeous outdoor eating area. Rooms are very clean with a super comfortable bed, and quiet. Room entry is very cool - uses fingerprint entry. Our only complaint was the rooms were very dark with insufficient lighting once the sun goes down. Despite this we would stay there again.",5,2015,10,14
40,IF you travel a lot you now the 5*,"Ok, i am tiered after a hard working day, and then A 3 hour flight to Barcelona. You know need food and your mouth is dry. 

A glass of prosecco? Mr XX.

Yes please!

Your room is ready.

And a map to the reseptionist best tapas bar is printed to you.

A nice dinner out.

Returning to the hotels bar for last hour discussion about tomorrow's negotiations. The bartender ask you, light or heavy red. Let you taste both. And it's hard to desside because both are great wine. Disussing, peaceful the next day. More drinks, by just a nod.

5***** from a experienced and toughest traveler.",5,2015,10,14
40,Boutique. 5 star. Loved it. ,"After 20 years of staying in 5 star hotels around the world, I think the are two major types. The large business hotel. Wall to wall marble. Professional. Spotless. All business.  Think ' Grand Hyatt'. And then there is the small, more intimate boutique hotel. The Alma hotel is in this category. Loved it. Funky. Modern. Friendly. Ultra professional. We enjoyed every minute in a very quiet, spacious 5th floor room overlooking the courtyard and across to La Pedura. I'd return in a heartbeat. The staff make this place very, very enjoyable. Kudos. ",5,2015,10,14
40,Alma,"Very nice upscale hotel in an excellent location. The staff was extraordinarily helpful and very accommodating. Breakfast quite expensive- business man's rather than tourist oriented.  Rooms very clean, nicely arranged. Excellent overall nut only moderately so for price. 

",5,2015,10,12
40,Hotel in the Best Location,"This lovely hotel is situated in the ""Beverly Hills"" of Barcelona.  It is a short walk away from the business of the old town so it is quiet and well situated to walk and site see.  Very clean and comfortable and the hotel staff is friendly and helpful.",5,2015,10,09
40,Fantastic hotel.,"Just got back from staying at the beautiful Alma Hotel for three nights. My husband booked here for my 40th birthday as a surprise. He did good! He booked an executive suite, but we were upgraded to the Alma suite and what a fantastic room/s these are.

You have a bathroom ""for guests""? A living area with a tv and Apple Mac, very large bedroom with tv and remote control curtains. A separate toilet, a seperate shower room, double sink and dressing area along with a roll top bath. There was also a massive balcony with table and chairs one end and two comfy arm chairs the other. The view wasn't much good though.

The mini bar consisted of two small bottles of champagne, lager, coca cola, water, juices, and a large bottle of both brandy and whiskey. 

The breakfast was not included and I felt was very expensive at €25 each, although there did seem to be quite a lot included for this price, but we felt it was a better experience and not to mention cheaper if you went for brunch at the many places on your doorstep. 

My disappointment was that there was no complimentary tea & coffee available here. 

The check in seemed a little off too, but looking back I'm not sure if this is a culture thing. 

The hotel was very impressive, but also very dark, although we liked that. 

It was a perfect base for us to go sightseeing, perfectly located and a luxurious place to stay. The bar is very expensive, two Jack Daniels coming in at €37! But it is a very nice place and you would expect to pay more somewhere like here.

Oh, also very disappointed that the roof terrace wasn't open to see la Pedrera, we were told it was closed because no one uses it and it was the winter? Well we wanted to use it and it was between 23-28 degrees so dont get that one at all! 

We went for a romantic getaway and that is exactly what we got. I would not go here with my children in tow, but I would return if I were to go to the fabulous Barcelona again.",5,2015,10,09
40,Good but not right for us,"This is a nice modern hotel with large rooms and tall ceilings, very clean (but quite dark) and in a good location near the modern area of the city.  It is very close to the Gaudi houses that you might want to visit.  Service seemed slow and check-in and for drinks but they did safely keep items for us that we accidentally left in the room safe.  Food and room service in the hotel is very very expensive and shuts down early however there are lots of nearby restaurants of every type.",3,2015,10,08
40,Wonderful Find,"Clean -- Modern -- Well thought out spacious rooms.  Great free Wifi (a must these days).
Fabulous Service -- Great Dining experience at the on site restaurant.
Central Location -- easy metro access to all tourist sites - walking distance to some.",5,2015,10,08
40,Ideal location & truly 5 star,"This hotel is ideally located just round the corner from the main shopping street and a short walk from the La Pedrera and Casa Batllo.  We found all the staff to be friendly, helpful and efficient and the food, both in the restaurant and the bar, first rate.  One can eat in the garden, which is a real oasis of calm.  Our room overlooked the garden, and there was no traffic noise.  The room was very comfortable, although the absence of a door to the bathroom required discretion.  The loo, however, did have a door.  If we visit the city again, we will certainly stay here.",5,2015,10,07
40,Wonderful Stay at Alma,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Alma for one evening before we left for a cruise. I have traveled quite a bit, and the service I received is the best I have experienced. We were greeted with a glass of Cava, and a nice gentleman came and took our bags to our room for us. Then it was the little things. We tried calling down to the lobby with a question, and when the phone didn't work properly, there was a knock at our door. It was the staff coming to us to answer our question. The toiletries were very nice, and smelled great as well. Then the next morning when we asked for a breakfast recommendation, a staff member walked us outside to make sure we understood his directions. When it was time to leave, the staff got us a taxi, spoke in Spanish to the driver, and helped load our bags. Wonderful service! 
Not to mention the location was great for walking around Barcelona, and our room was lovely.",5,2015,10,05
40,A great hotel.,"Great location, attentive staff, beautiful minimalism design, nice spa area, perfect for city trip.  
Newly renovated it provides luxury at a fair price. With fingerprinted door entry it is very modern. Free minibar was very appealing too. Very clean and fresh. Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Barcelona as the location was ideal.",5,2015,10,05
40,"Lovely Stay, Great Location!","We arrived past midnight and were very tired but check-in was swift and simple with very friendly staff. The hotel operates on a keyless system where your fingerprint is used to enter the room, which was extremely convenient!

The room had a very modern decor but it did not compromise on comfort. The amenities were great but could have been replaced more frequently as it may not be enough especially if you have long hair. However, just a call was needed for them to send more up.

Breakfast at the hotel was great! It was a mix of a buffet spread as well as a small ala carte menu. Great quality food with a relaxing atmosphere to start the day! We had dinner at the hotel as well, and were pleasantly surprised at the lovely food and service.

The hotel has a great location as it is walking distance to quite a number of touristy spots as well as good restaurants. The hotel staff were also very helpful in their recommendations and even offered to book our sightseeing tickets for us.

We would definitely recommend this and will not hesitate to come back!",5,2015,10,03
40,perfect location,"We arrived in Barcelona by train after a short stay in Valencia. The hotel is in a perfect location for exploring The city.
On arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff on reception and offered a glass of cava during the check in process.
We had a room on a high floor with roof top views of la Pedrera. The location was very peaceful.
The hotel,is ideally located to use the excellent metro system in Barcelona.
We did experience a minor hitch during our stay. The extractor fans from the kitchens below our room had malfunctioned and on our return we found out room to be smoky and smelly.
Reception were quick to offer us a change of rooms because if this problem, which we did. I do think it would have been nice if they had offered a form of compensation for the inconvenience as in the form of a complimentary breakfast? 
The rooms are very modern and some may fund them too bare. We liked the hotel and would recommend to others. We would consider returning if we visited Barcelona again. ",5,2015,10,02
40,LOVE this hotel,"This was such an excellent hotel! perfect location close to Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, Casa Batllo and great restaurants...the beds / bedding feels like you are sleeping on a cloud, delicious breakfast, well designed and detailed, great courtyard and roof top (where we got to see La Merce fireworks), and the service (big thumbs up to Quentin and all the doormen!) is fantastic. Highly recommend this hotel and we will certainly come back again!",5,2015,09,29
40,Amazing hotel,"Details in other reviews are spot on regarding the quality and amenities in and the location of this five-star gem. I would add that the people that work here are the true highlights of this property. Everyone from the rooftop barkeep to the front desk/concierge staff is unbelievably friendly and accommodating. As an example, at the front desk they helped us buy, and then print, our tickets for Sagrada Familia and Park Guell which saved us untold amounts of time waiting in lines at those venues. While we visited other five-stars for drinks and they were nice, we would never consider staying anywhere other than Alma Barcelona.",5,2015,09,29
40,A fabulous surprise in a beautiful part of Barcelona,"Love love this hotel!

I’m in to tech so the first thing that totally impressed me is that you had finger-print access to your hotel room and the gym.  Wow!  In all the hotels I’ve stayed in worldwide, I’ve always gotten one sort of key or another.  This time, you just have to make sure you have your index finger with you!

The decor is dark, moody yet stylish.  Although the facade of the building was old, the interior had been completely gutted and rebuilt.  Our room was very spacious and had an open-bathroom concept.  Simple.  Effective.  Modern.  The only thing that drives me crazy, which so many hotels are starting to do now in the name of eco conservation, is that they turn the aircon down in the middle of the night so that you always wake up hot and sweaty.  Agh!

The restaurant on the ground floor is excellent.  Had a couple wonderful meals there with amazing service.  And then there is the rooftop bar.  Great views - Sagrada Familia a short distance away, shingled rooftops spreading out in all direction, the sea in the distance.  And a bartender who knew what he was doing.

There’s even a pool in the basement with a very small gym.  Although they really didn’t have much equipment in there, it actually did the job.

This is a great base from where to explore this beautiful and incredibly vibrant city.",5,2015,09,29
40,Great hotel!,"Fabulous hotel - loved the design and decor.  Great customer service and excellent location.  We loved the attention to detail.  Unlike the large luxury 5-star hotels, the smaller size of this hotel allows it to feel both more quiet and more personal.  They also have a lovely rooftop, where we enjoyed great city views and live music.  Would not hesitate to come back.",5,2015,09,28
40,Simply stylish and chilled,"Stunning hotel in perfect location within easy reach of all of Barcelona's attractions. Staff were extremely courteous and couldn't have been more helpful. We had a grand deluxe room on the 5th floor overlooking the courtyard and Casa Mila. Our room was so quiet and comfortable and the linen was so soft and silky, absolute bliss. Huge bathroom with walk in shower, loads of storage space, spotlessly clean everywhere. Great little touches of chocolates on the bedside when the room was turned down in the evening and a free mini bar. Plenty of electrical sockets but also built in iPhone and iPad chargers and also 2 x usb charging sockets. Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel - it's perfect.",5,2015,09,28
40,My favorite hotel ever!,"This fantastic boutique hotel was by far the nicest property I have ever stayed in. Our room was upgraded gratis as our original room was not ready when we arrived. It was gorgeous! Fifth floor with a view of the hotel courtyard. The bed was phenomenally comfortable with lush down comforters and soft pillows. The bathrooms concrete vanity was beautiful as was the marble shower. There is no door on the shower which took a little getting used to but was fine! The room was huge especially by European standards. The front desk was friendly and helpful......recommending restaurants, calling cabs, offering beverages. Breakfast was terrific with more of a selection than other European hotels we have stayed in. The courtyard was lovely as was the rooftop bar we only discovered on the last night of our trip! I am sure they told us but with all the info given at check in I think we just missed it. The location was perfect as were able to walk to wherever we wanted to go.....Picasso Museum, Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo, and many excellent restaurants. While we were there a fantastic mobile work of art was installed in the lobby which was beautiful and only added to the modern feel of the hotel. I would highly recommend and would absolutely come here again!",5,2015,09,28
40,Wonderful service and location but some mixed feelings ,"Excellent service from staff - pre arrival and during visit. 
Helped us each day make dinner reservations. 
Booked a Grand deluxe room. King bed. Spacious. 5th floor. Facing street side but extremely quiet from indoor and outside noise. 
Walk in shower (no bath) and private toilet area. Only a single sink in my room yet my friends had the room type (grand deluxe) but it had a double sink with separate bath as well. 
Free beverage minibar (nice option) but no in room coffee machine. 
Would have been nice to have things like  a full length mirror, small bathroom make-up mirror.
Nice complimentary bath products.  Hair dryer...but the type you have to hold the ON bottom constantly to operate. 
Good location in the Eixample district. Nearby main shopping street and coffee shop for quick breakfast. Approx. 20-25 minute walk down to the el Born - Gothic area. 
Paid Euro 250 per night booked almost 9 months in advance.
It only had 1 small elevator to service the hotel. Can be sometimes slow. They have an Indoor pool and sauna which I didn't use. 
My mixed feelings are with respect to the decor. Rooms are very minimalist in style....and overall decor throughout the hotel is very somber. Lobby, halls....Dark Browns, greys....not really my taste. Something to consider if booking. ",4,2015,09,27
40,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"This hotel exceeded all expectations from the minute we arrived.  We were greeted at a sit down check-in and offered a beverage of our choice (we chose delicious cava) and a staff member promptly walked us to our room (which we could access by a finger print instead of a bulky key--how cool is that?).  The room is simple and modern, with a comfortable bed/pillows and a wonderful shower with overhead showerhead.  The hotel lobby is elegant, but the part we loved the best was the garden area out for sitting, reading,sipping wine or having food.  Just delightful.  The rooftop bar afforded great views, although it was quite windy the day we visited.  The hot part of the breakfast is cooked to order, with special offerings each day.  The cold part of the breakfast was a buffet with everything you could ever want.  Was it worth the $25pp/day?  Maybe once, since it is so relaxing in their dining room and the quality of the food was so high, but we thought that the next time we visit we would walk to a neighborhood cafe and eat a bit lighter to save room for other meals.  

It was easy to walk everywhere, and restaurants/shops were aplenty.  While Barcelona is a busy city with heavy traffic, this hotel is situated just off the main street, so it was very quiet.  

I'm very picky about my hotels, but there is no question that I would highly recommend the Hotel Alma.  We wouldn't even think of staying anywhere else when we come back to Barcelona.",5,2015,09,25
40,Cool Hotel near Pedrera,We really enjoyed our stay in this funky yet very stylish and contemporary hotel. The staff were excellent and we liked the techy touch of fingerprint room access! Rooftop bar overlooking La Pedrera one side and the cost in the other is cool too.,5,2015,09,24
40,Absolutely Fantastic! ,"This is a must stay in hotel if ur in Barcelona! Absolutely amazing staff, great rooms, clean, and centrally located! 
We couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay in, staff were friendly from start to finish. Breakfast was amazing, good choices with a beautiful garden and background classical music. Loved it. Will definitely return . ",5,2015,09,23
40,Sleek,"As soon as our taxi pulled up outside there was someone on the street to greet us. The service for our whole three night stay was perfect from start to finish. The design of the hotel is modern and sleek. The hotel pillows are AMAZING. I just cannot describe it. We did not eat at the hotel as during a city trip it is nice to explore and have breakfast, lunch and dinner out. There is a lovely garden area where we would have a drink in the evening before going out for dinner. Barcelona is a big city however we were very happy with our location. ",5,2015,09,23
40,Spectacular!,"Our stay at the Alma was incredible. Amongst the hotels I've stayed in, there are very few hotels that have completely exceeded my expectations in every regard - from exceptional customer service, spaciousness, comfort, cleanliness, quality, location, and so on. Easily the best hotel I've stayed in Europe, Asia, and the states as well. 

The Alma has a clean, trendy modern decor. I was impressed by the super soft bedding (I wouldn't stop talking about it to my significant other), waterfall shower, spacious tub, gym, pool, and efficient wifi. We were lucky to have a balcony that overlooks the garden. There's something so magical about opening up the balcony screen door to the slow classical music playing in the garden, the cool breeze, and the view of the buildings surrounding the hotel.

Although the hotel is in a more touristy part of town, the location is worth being close by to stores, great restaurants, the train, local landmarks, as well as an abundance of taxis as well. There were little things that really surprised me in our stay - here's a couple:
- Being offered chilled water upon our arrival
- Sharing a notice on our door knob every morning with a daily update on weather, restaurant reservations, and any additional requests we have for our stay 
- Very friendly and genuine smiles from the staff

While on the higher end of hotels with above average pricing at 250-300 a night, it was well worth it. Would stay here again in a heart beat, though I wish I could stay forever!",5,2015,09,23
40,Luxury and efficiency.,"We drove up and were greeted quickly. We accepted the valet parking for three days.  We sat down with Fernando and he explained everything and made us welcome. Our bags were quickly brought to our room which was clean, spacious, and as we learned, very quiet. The hotel is within walking distance of most of what we came to see and there are numerous eateries in the vicinity. This is a luxurious hotel and an oasis in the city. We made our reservations months ago and we locked in a great rate. Just our luck!  Highly recommended. ",5,2015,09,18
40,"Highly recommend. Excellent service, location.","We stayed at Alma Barcelona for a couple nights and everything about this experience was positive. Reception was friendly and very helpful. The location of this hotel is what any visitor to this amazing city would be looking for. I would even say it is a good value, given exceptional all-around aspects. 
There is a spa and indoor pool / steam / sauna that were all laid out very nicely. 
Great use of space and interior design elements that also made the experience positive. 
We did take advantage of the rooftop bar, and had amazing time while enjoying a few bands. Overall good service on rooftop, and amazing view east to Sagrada Família and the view north over neighbouring Casa Milà rooftop details to the mountain summit where Sagrat Cor church and Tibidabo Amusement Park are dramatically perched. 
Just south of hotel a few steps is Casa Batlló for the Gaudi fans.
Beds were great, slept fantastic.
Very impressive breakfast selection and refreshing and pleasant Catalan staff throughout. 
Would recommend to everyone.",4,2015,09,17
40,contemporary with a superb location ,Alma surprises. It is a hotel that really grows on you. The location is superb - quite and relaxing and far from La Ramblas. Recommendations for restaurants given by the concierge were all spot on. The Alma itself serves very good food in a great courtyard. A couple of suggestions - the menu could be more extensive and when the kitchen closes at 11pm dont tell guests at 10.55pm that the kitchen is closed.,4,2015,09,12
40,One of the new 5 stars in Barcelona,"We absolutely loved this relative new 5 star hotel
Rooms are spacious , minimalistic decoration . Perfect central location only 50 meters from Passeo de Gracia. Nice roof terrace with live jazz music. Will recommend to friends
Relation price quality very high",5,2015,09,09
40,Fantastic Hotel,This hotel is a great place to stay. It was our first time to Barcelona. The Alma is centrally located close to many great restaurants and bus stops for hop on hop off tours of the city (which is a great way to see the city). The hotel was very nice and the staff was outstanding. I highly recommend.,5,2015,09,09
40,Classically nice.,"Clean, tall ceilings, cool chic.  Great food, attentive concierges.  Would stay again without a second thought.  The rooftop bar was also a lot of fun, and many things worth seeing were within walking distance.",5,2015,09,08
40,Alma Hotel - Hidden Secret,"From the moment the taxi pulled up outside to the time we left the staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful and nothing was too much effort.  The hotel is lovely and the location just off the Passeig de Gracia is perfect and I would certainly recommend it.  We stayed in a corner room which was large and comfortable and the beds were first class.  The housekeeping was excellent.  I cannot think of one negative about this hotel and I hope to return to Barcelona in the near future and this is definitely where I'll be staying.",5,2015,09,08
40,Best experience in Barcelona,"This is the only place my wife and I will ever stay at when we visit Barcelona.  Staff is first class, to mention Sofi at Reception, Gerardo at the lounge and the rest of the staff who were so attentive to us during our stay.  

Hotel was clean, food was excellent, outdoor area for cigars was awesome, bar selection for Scotch was well appointed and the location was perfect; walking distance to shops and restaurants.

Whether you speak Spanish or English, the staff is the best I've experienced in all my travels.

I recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to check this Gem out.  And, don't hesitate to ask the staff where the locals eat - they will tell you where the tourists eat and where they eat.  You won't be disappointed as they directed us to the best Tapas we've ever had.

Cheers to great management for instilling such a warm and caring culture at Alma Barcelona.  We'll be back.

Len and Mia Mercado",5,2015,09,07
40,Doesn't Get Much Better,"Serene, modern, soothing, beautiful spaces. Stunning outdoor patio and garden with spacious seating arrangements in multiple outdoor rooms. Fun rooftop bar with live music while we were there, interesting subterranean spa and pool. Fantastic location for Sagrada Familia and Pg de Gracia shopping. But best of all was the staff, oozing with warmth and good humor. And you get to sit down while checking in/out. And they bring you coffee, champagne, etc. What a concept!",5,2015,09,05
40,Minimalism but nothing lacking,"From the moment we walked through the door to the reception this hotel oozed quality. The room was spacious and well laid out and the service exceptional. Located a stones throw from Casa Milia the location, although a slight walk from the attractions of the old town is well served within the Eixemple district. Highly recommended without hesitation.",5,2015,09,03
40,Highly recommended!,"Cannot really fault this hotel.
The decor is modern and spacious, but maintains some of the old charm of the building.
The staff are EXCELLENT and so welcoming and helpful.
The meals, breakfast and dinner, both wonderful and well prepared.
The rooms are huge, airy and modern.
The roof terrace offers excellent views all around the city.
We LOVED the fingerprint recognition system for your room and other areas (e.g. gym) as this meant not having to carry keys.... or lose those plastic cards.
The gym & pool area is small, but very stylish and reasonably well equipped.
The garden is also a relaxing place to enjoy a drink.
Our top-tip.... is to do their Sunday Brunch, you get a lot of fine food & drink for your money.",5,2015,09,03
40,"Restrained elegance, ultra courteous service, perfect location","This is a modern hotel designed with dark woods in a contemporary style, a current and refreshing take on the hotel atrium, a lovely grotto-like gym-spa and a casual patio courtyard that has a park-like feel. The rooms are also beautiful and restrained with nice space. There is a hushed feeling throughout that conveys a welcome sense of calm. Most unexpected was the staff. Every single one was so courteous, pleasant and eager to be helpful in every way. Hats off to Alma!!",5,2015,09,02
40,"Spacious rooms, excellent location, great service","great hotel. Excellent location. walk to many of Barcelona's main attractions
we had to take a cab only a few times - to go to Park Guel, camp nou,
montf neighborhoods. All of the other attractions were within reasonable
walking distance.

Room was very spacious and well appointed. Excellent and helpful front desk.
it was a bit odd that the bathroom did not have any doors. could have done
with some more hangers in the closets. Items in the room fridge were
complimentary - which was kind of cool.

the lobby/bar open out into a quiet garden - wonderful place for a nightcap.
Highly recommended.

We didn't eat there - so can't comment on the food.
the lobby and interiors are rather dark - the interior decor in common 
areas leans towards darker hues. 
Not distasteful - but i personal preference is towards a bit lighter interior.
may appeal to others.",4,2015,08,30
40,"Modern, yet elegant!","There's so many things I loved about this hotel:

1. Modern, yet classy - you smile every time you walk i.
2. Beautiful backyard and rooftop bar - so many great places to hang out after hours
3. Great location - walking distance to everything; wonderful shops and cafes nearby
4. Amazing staff - courteous, helpful, and professional
5. Rooms - simple, clean, and nice size rooms

I'm definitely returning to the Alma the next time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2015,08,30
40,Amazing Honeymoon,"Chose this hotel for its location and facilities, we were not disappointed. On arrival we were greeted with a drink and full explanation of all the facilities etc for the hotel. Prior to our visit they helped me organise everything because it was a surprise Honeymoon, went like clockwork and could not have done it without their help. The room was large and spotlessly clean, could not fault it. The pool/sauna/spa was amazing and free and we also enjoyed the roof top bar. Location of the hotel was perfect and we managed to do all our sightseeing by foot, spoilt for choice of restaurants/cafes etc. Made our Honeymoon a very remember full one.",5,2015,08,27
40,Modern comfort & convenience,"The Alma has a great location, near the best stores, restaurants, and Gaudi houses, but still an easy walk to everywhere.  We were welcomed and checked in by a gracious host in the lounge, then taken to our large, modern grand deluxe room with every convenience.  Concierge service was excellent, with fine dining recommendations and good food on the night we decided to eat in.  Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom.  The hotel is on a quiet street in a quiet neighborhood.  There were numerous cafes for breakfast nearby for those, like us, who prefer a small, inexpensive breakfast rather than a big hotel deal.",5,2015,08,25
40,A completely delightful urban oasis in a location that cannot be beaten,"11 out of 10. They get everything so right! It's one thing to make things look good and photogenic but quite another to create a truly relaxing atmosphere to exudes class and refinement. This place has to be experienced to be appreciated.

Alfresco breakfast to light uplifting classical tunes in their natural garden, where birds abound, is a fantastic way to gently awaken your senses each day. The cakes and the sandwiches are excellent too. In fact, all baked goods and pastries are very tasty. ",5,2015,08,25
40,August 2015,"In Barcelona this summer I have so far stayed at the Pullman Hotel, the Alma Hotel, The Grand Marina Hotel, and the Arts Hotel. The Arts Hotel beats, by far, the other hotels. No comparison. The Alma was okay. Terrace was closed on the Sunday, leaving only the garden. Service was okay. Location is not bad. Not overly impressed. Nicer than the Pullman and Grand Marina. Does not compare to the Arts Hotel.",3,2015,08,24
40,Exceeded expectations ,"Let's starts with the location. It's walking distance from passeig de gracia, placa catalunya, las ramblas, great shopping, awesome cafes/restaurants, ATMs, pharmacies etc. It's just off (maybe 10 meters) passeig de gracia so that the traffic and noise doesn’t bother you. In fact it's amazingly peaceful considering its next to one of Barcelona's main tourist hub. My wife & I are not the walking types but everyday we would find ourselves stepping out of the hotel and before we would realize, we would've reached end of passeig de gracia. It's really the upmarket & classy side of town.
The room we stayed in was spacious enough for us with a separate toilet (good idea). The furniture and decor was minimalist keeping in line with the hotel's overall design theme. The beds were comfortable and washroom was good with a bath tub and a big overhead rain shower (the washroom doesn't have a door that closes so if you're the private type, you might have an issue). 
There's a spa and a pool though we didn't try either. 
The breakfast was healthy with different juices, berries, fruits, cereals, grain breads and made to order sandwiches, eggs and more. 
The staff were immensely helpful and friendly. They went out of their way to help us in anything we wanted. One gentlemen even paid from his card because our cards wouldn't work on one particular site. Needless to say, we paid him in cash. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't have a sense of entitlement and believes in reciprocity of behavior. ",5,2015,08,23
40,A gem in the heart of Barcelona,"Although designed for adults, my family loved the decor and the fine furnishings in the room (my son kept mentioning how ""futuristic"" it looked). The front desk were very friendly and helpful and most welcoming in every way. Rooms are spacious with elegant touches and very high quality materials. The beds gave one of the best sleeps we have experienced with heavenly pillows. The only faults were a lunchtime kitchen that wanted to close 20 minutes early so that the staff could leave right on time. And although the front desk was super friendly, we received some bad advice on museum tickets purchases so don't be afraid to double-check whenever you don't feel 100% sure. Those were fairly minor as our overall impression is very good, and the location just off Barcelona's most famous shopping avenue (Passeig de Gracia) was awesome. ",5,2015,08,23
40,One of the best hotels we have stayed at,"Alma Hotel is quietly tucked away just steps from the rather busy Passeig the Gracia (which happens to be the best upmarket shopping street in Barcelona). The service is second to none and from check-in to check-out we felt extremely well looked after. Staff helped us with restaurant recommendations and reservations as well as recommendations of what to see. 
The style of the hotel is very plush, modern and understated luxury. Perfect for a long weekend away without the kids. 
The breakfast buffet was luxurious with a vast selection of freshly baked breads and pastries as well as locally produced cheeses and meats. Not the place to go if you're the sort of person who insists on a ""full english"", but a lovely treat if you're a foodie. The bar was quietly busy at night and again, the service was flawless. There is a small but perfectly formed spa in the cellar and I had one of the best massages I've ever had.
The courtyard is a quiet oasis in the middle of a bustling city, and having our morning coffee out there we felt very much part of the city, but in a very peaceful way.",5,2015,08,23
40,Excellent stay at a first class property,"Really couldn't fault it, beautiful room, great location, superb staff! I think my only small points would be that the roof terrace was only open at night and it would have been a lovely place to sit during the day.",5,2015,08,23
40,Upscale sanctuary in perfect location in Barcelona,"We were in Barcelona for a week in August and stayed in a Junior Suite at the Alma . It was as big as a condo , flawless in design , exceptionally clean . It was a perfect place to return to after a day out exploring the city . The patio area was beautiful , the roof top was a must for views , and the service at the hotel was the best we've experienced.The location was amazing because you could walk to many of the attractions and close to the Hop on Hop off  bus , market , and major shopping. The reception staff were attentive and helped us arrange things we wanted to do . The breakfast was outstanding 
Romantic , contemporary , one of the nicest hotels we've stayed at .",5,2015,08,20
40,Alma Hotel: A very nice welcome to Barcelona,"Traveling to Barcelona for the first time, and with the myriad of hotels, I initially choose the Alma Hotel to spend time there before a Mediterreanean cruise.  The staff was extremely welcoming during check-in, realizing that I was had just flown from Philadelphia and was a bit jet lagged, searching for a room for a complimentary early check in.  The room was well appointed, with a great view of the garden area. The complimentary WiFi, was easy to link into and was fast!  The location on Mallorca street is one block from the Passeig de Gracias, and I would say a 20 minute walk on Mallorca to the Sagrada Familia.  The breakfast there was excellent with a mixture of traditional Catalan/Spanish pastries, cheeses, hams, with made to order egg dishes, and delicious fresh squeezed orange juice.

Incidentally, I had left a shaving kit at the hotel and contacted the hotel while on the cruise, and they responded very quickly and found the bag and retrieved it when I returned from my cruise.

It was a very good value for the price, and I would highly recommend this property to others visiting Barcelona",5,2015,08,19
40,Hotel Alma- Barcelona July 2015,All I can say about this hotel is that it is fantastic!  This was the first hotel we checked into on our trip to Spain in July 2015 and we were so excited to have a great place to stay after 10 hours of travelling from the United States!  The staff was great and we really enjoyed being offered a glass of sparkling wine as we checked into the hotel!  The rooms were big and very quiet!  Loved the roof top bar and the outside patio.  The hotel is in a great location and very easy to get to some great shopping and local sites!  I highly recommend staying here!!,5,2015,08,17
40,Cool...and then some,"We stayed here one night after stopping off in BCN on our way back to London from Sitges.

Loved the check in. Very personal and 'different'. Offered drinks etc. and given local information. Chose to go 'fingerprint' vs. key. Fun AND it worked!

The hotel is very much design-led. Although a previous reviewer suggested that kids wouldn't be happy, there were a few (albeit trendy) there who seemed to be fine (there IS a pool too). If you are into your design (Van de Rohe etc.) you'll love this place. Lots of concrete finishes and minimalist lines. 

Up to the room. Popped my finger on the reader and hey presto; room door open!

BIG WOW. If you're not a fan of minimalism, you probably won't have the same experience. But I loved it. 

Super comfy bed (with incredibly soft linens) and a big bathroom with luxury toiletries (that came home to London with me!). Loewe TV and useful desk area. 

WiFi that was actually fast and free!

We went down to the spa/gym which although small - has everything you need. We had a dip in the pool to cool down from the BCN weather. Water free/available. 

Had drinks in the bar. Very cool and with a buzzy vibe. Make sure you take a look at the sky bar too for some great views.

Breakfast was then tops. Time meant we only had the continental but it was fantastic. Excellent quality, great products. 

Ten minute walk to the Aerobus.

Hard to see how this hotel (and it's location) could be beaten.",5,2015,08,16
40,"Wonderfully located, Modern hotel, with all the ammenities and Great staff!","We stayed at the Alma this past week and enjoyed every moment of our visit.  We were greeted by friendly staff at reception and were made to feel most welcome.  Our rooms (Suite and Deluxe Room 1 for my husband and I and 1 for our 19 & 21yr olds) were modern and spacious, the bar was a friendly spot and drinks are very reasonably priced for such a high end hotel.   Staff spoke English very well and went out of their way to ensure we were well looked after.",5,2015,08,15
40,Excellent!,"I stayed in the Alma Hotel in July 2015, as an expensive 'treat' for ten nights.  Despite being far too hot in Barcelona (the European heat wave!), my trip was wonderful.  I have stayed in other hotels in BCN and have to say that this exceeded my high expectations.  I called the hotel and asked for a blue Executive Suite, and they were very accommodating and ensured I had the room I had seen on their website.  The Executive Suite had a separate seating area, and huge bathroom.  I had room service on many occasions, which I didn't feel was 'expensive' compared to what you would pay in a London hotel. The hotel has a private and quiet garden which was wonderful to sit out in, to read and enjoy some tranquility in a busy city.  The service was personal and superb - every member of staff went out their way to take their time to ensure I was dealt with professionally.  As an aside, I booked the hotel on a website and was horrified 2 days before to find out that my credit card had not worked and my room had been cancelled!  I called the hotel and spoken to Quentin; having explained my predicament and being told the hotel was now full up, he resolved my situation and booked my room directly with the hotel, and honoured the price I was quoted when I booked originally via a travel website, much to my relief.    I would point out, that this is NOT a hotel for children.  There is nothing for them to do - there is no pool.  But if you are looking for 'posh' but contemporary (the hotel is very manly/industrial in its interior design - very 'with it' in terms of style), certainly no chavs, and some refinement, then this is the hotel for you!  Thank you Alma for wonderful service and an excellent stay.",5,2015,08,14
40,Outstanding !,"This hotel is a true 5*
Staff are excellent in all respects
Clean, secure, modern, quiet, fashionable, excellent location.
Superb suite - comfort, excellent bed, quality of the decor & bathroom was outstanding.
Was sad to check out !
One very minor criticism - no kettle or coffee making in the room",5,2015,08,13
40,Concierge and staff could not have been better,"FIrst of all Santiago and Fernando were hands down the best Hotel Concierge I've come in contact with. Their level of helpfulness and expertise could not have been better. 
The hotel is gorgeous. appointed with mostly mid century modern antique furniture and lighting. Modern and chic decor while being  cozy and inviting. A lovely restaurant and courtyard secluded in the heart of the city block.  The breakfast was so amazing, fresh made goat cheese and marmalades, the best meats  and cheeses sourced from all over Spain. I found I didn't want to leave the hotel it was that good. A large and surprisingly spacious room was such a comfy respite from the city for afternoon siestas. The comfort of the well dressed bed was amazing, tempurepedic I believe and the softest his and her down comforters. Rooftop bar was a haven to see the city from with fantastic cocktail crafted from the talented bartenders. Everything about the Alma was above and beyond any European 5 star hotel I've ever stayed at.",5,2015,08,13
40,A great hotel all round!,"The Alma is situated perfectly - in the Eixample district near many high end shops and restaurants but only a few minutes walk from La Rambla and la Sagrada Familia. 
We stayed at the Alma for 3 days with 3 kids, one a teenager who found it easy to get to the areas that interested her most (around the old city), while we were comfortable in the slightly slower paced Eixample. 
The service at the hotel was excellent, the staff was helpful with each and every request we had, including amazing recommendations of restaurants.
We took 2 Grand Delux rooms on the 6th floor which were beautifully designed and very spacious (we could add a third bed in one of them). The view was an extra perk - it included the roof of La Pedrera.
The kids loved using the indoor pool in the spa at the end of the day which we were surprised to learn wasn't off bounds for them. It was just big enough to play around in and extremely quiet (except for when my kids were there).
The food in the restaurant was delicious even though with the abundance of restaurants around we only ate there once when we were too tired to go out.",5,2015,08,13
40,"Extremely Trendy and cool Hotel, Great staff speaking english and amazing location !","Stayed in a Beautiful and modern Deluxe plus room, with a nice view on the garden, it was quiet and yet in the middle of the city where beautiful shops and nice restaurants meet on the passeo De Gracia.",4,2015,08,13
40,"Trendy, modern hotel, great staff!","We absolutely loved this hotel. The Concierge staff was friendly and helpful, the check in process was fast and easy and the rooms were very modern and trendy, spacious and clean, and in an upscale section of Barcelona. The rooms offered free juice, beverages, and cold beers, the beds were comfortable and the rooms very dark, with good A/C.  In addition to a cozy ground floor lounge and restaurant, the hotel has an indoor sauna, steam room and pool, and a rooftop bar.  Everything about the Hotel Alma was modern, trendy, and professional -- a great value for the price!",5,2015,08,10
40,Superb,"Just opposite LV and all the shopping are just around the area. Very good service and free juices in the room. Very comfy bed and spacious. Security is tight too , can choose to us fingerprint instead of room cards. 
Do have coffee in the hidden restaurant at the lobby , lots of greens surrounding . 
Very good stay",5,2015,08,09
40,Probably the best in Eixample,"Stayed in an executive suite. Unbeatable location right off Passeig de Gracia, impressive decor honoring the best of Barcelona's modern design tradition, excellent service, very helpful and friendly staff, SPECTACULAR garden, great spa (including a roofed swimming pool) and a superb restaurant. If I had to constructively single out just two things for improvement: closets (at least in my suite) need to have artificial lighting installed and housekeeping was a bit slow sometimes.",5,2015,08,07
40,Wonderful modern hotel,Service was warm and friendly.  Rooms were spacious and beautifully clean.  Lovely outdoor dining area with great food.  Reasonably sized portions.  Daily international newspapers to read in lobby.  Quiet if you're above the 3rd floor.,5,2015,08,07
40,An oasis of calm and service in heart of city,"This hotel hit all the buttons for me -- boutique size, outstanding service, friendly and welcoming staff, low-key vibe, excellent location, luxe rooms, great value for money. 

Barcelona can be bustling and a bit overwhelming, especially in the heat of summer. So what a treat to return to a quiet interior garden at the back of the hotel. Take a book out there, sit in a lounge chair under a leafy tree and order a freshly made mojito  -- it's heaven after a long day. The underground spa with small lap pool, super clean sauna/steam room and exercise gym will also rejuvenate you. Our college-age son enjoyed late-night drinks with friends at the rooftap bar, which affords sweeping views of the city.

Can't say enough about the staff, who greeted us with a cold beer and Coca Cola and accommodated an early check-in after a long journey. Santiago and Marcos helped us with insider restaurant tips (best seafood paella in Barcelona) and any other needs we had. They even patiently endured our high-school level Spanish with a smile ...

Simply one of the best hotels I have stayed in during many years of European travel.",5,2015,08,07
40,Absolutely Great Hotel,"Great welcome on arrival, with smooth greeting, easy check in  process and friendly helpful staff -  set the tone for our stay. Staff here couldn't be more helpful throughout, really impressed with quality and standards. 
We ate at the hotel for my wife's birthday and went with the tasting menu - beautifully cooked food and genuine concern from the staff that we were dissatisfied with one course (cuttlefish - well cooked and prepared, but neither my wife or I actually liked the texture), but the staff wanted to make sure there wasn't a problem - really smoothly done.
Hotels location is also great, just off a main shopping street, lots of bars restaurants nearby and a gentle 15-20 minute walk downhill (really a gentle slope!) to Las Ramblas - and 2 minutes from a Metro station if you don't want walk back up.
Room was great, overlooking the courtyard at the rear of the hotel with something of a view of Gaudi's chimneys at La Pedrera.
Oh, and try the rooftop bar - great views over the city!
Just a really, really great hotel!",5,2015,08,07
40,"AMAZING HOTEL, BIG MODERN ROOMS, GREAT STAFF AND GREAT LOCATION","IF YOU GO TO BARCELONA STAY HERE!
My wife and I loved our stay in Barcelona thanks to this fantastic hotel!  
The location cant be beat, there are great shops and restaurants all around.  The subway/metro is only about a block or so away.  
The room was much bigger than we ever expected and we had a courtyard view which was great, and never noisy.  We got the ""Deluxe"" room.  Dont let the pictures fool you, it was very large and comfortable with the toilet totally private.  Also there are large windows but dont worry about the light coming through, it has sliding doors as an added bonus to block out the light and sleep in.
We also had a complimentary mini bar and loved the soaps/shampoos that were provided.
The staff couldnt have been nicer and were quick to point us towards some amazing restaurants. We only speak english but that was never an issue at the hotel.
We ALWAYS felt safe at the hotel and in the surrounding area.

An added bonus is the roof deck.  Go up at night and you can see the light show on  on the roof one of the Gaudi buildings nearby.",5,2015,08,06
40,amazing hotel feels at home,"the location of the hotel is excellent and we had spacious room .the staff very friendly and helpful especially the gust relation manager Elizabeth .the food was excellent we definitely recommend this hotel for any visitor to Barcelona.

40,Alma Hotel Central Barcelona,"What a wonderfully modern, super spotless hotel with a very quiet and tranquil outside bar setting - perfect for an afternoon drink and relax with family or friends. Modern food menu - probably a little too expensive for everyday eating...",5,2015,08,04
40,Pretty darn good!,"The hotel is in an amazing location just off the main street of Passeig de Gracia within walking distance of the typical tourist attractions (our room had a view of La Pedrera) but also close to an quite a few top class restaurants; Tapas 24, La Sarte, Hisop are all easily walked to. It feels like a very safe part of town also and worries of pick pocketing felt like a world away. 

The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful (not overly formal or stiff which was great). They helped us with directions on Metro lines, stations, etc., with enthusiasm.
The room was great, spacious and furnished in a really clean mid-century/modern style. 

The overall interior design of the hotel was similar. Outside there is a fantastic garden bar and restaurant area which has the option of sun or a covered area. Really relaxing place to be after the hustle and bustle of the city streets, I nodded off at least once after lunch on a couch! Also, there is a hidden gem on the rough; a really cool rooftop terrace and bar which had live music on both nights we stayed which enhanced the chilled out feel. Again, the bar staff were excellent. Reasonable value also considering the 5 star rating and location.

There were minor flaws but nothing too irksome. In the room, the bathroom door was difficult to open/close as it stuck on a raised piece of flooring which was quite scraped. It didnt make a huge difference but not what you would expect. Also, the pool is very shallow but I am sure there were design constraints but if you are a keen swimmer who likes a pool to unwind then maybe this isnt the place for you.

Overall, I have no problem recommending the Alma. The staff were excellent and could not do enough to help. I loved the design and will definitely return. We were truly impressed, it is a haven of tranquility in a hectic city. Perfect for a couples city break or a business visit.",5,2015,08,03
40,Excellent ,"Great hotel and staff, no complaints at all and would definitely recommend and use again on any future visits to Barcelona, lovely garden and in a great area of Barcelona, especially if you like shopping, it is surrounded by the high end stores, Louis Vuitton and Cartier are there neighbours! ",5,2015,07,29
40,Best boutique hotel stay ever,"The Alma Barcelona is a great option for anyone seeking to visit Barcelona, and do so with style.  The hotel is beautiful and perfectly located.  Right from the get go the staff greets you with great joy and a very high level of customer service.  The rooms are of a very good size and full of amenities.  They have a servi-bar that can be used at no charge with some basics.  The outdoor patio is a great place for breakfast, a drink or just for sitting down.  If I ever had to come back I would stay here again, hands down.  I have travelled extensively and would put this as one of the top hotels in style, value, location and service",5,2015,07,29
40,Weekend in Barcelona,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Alma Barcelona Hotel this weekend. It's a lovely hotel and very centrally located. Very easy to explore the city and surrounding areas from the hotel. The decor is very tasteful and thoughtfully designed with great fittings and fixtures. Fantastic use of space in our executive suite too. 

The staff were all very helpful and attentive with all our requests and made great recommendations for places to eat and things to do. A huge thank you to Elisabeth and her wonderful colleagues for providing guest experience as it should be.

When we visit Barcelona in the future we'll certainly be staying here again. ",5,2015,07,26
40,Perfecto,"From the staff to the location to the amenities - everything was perfect!  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful with excellent English, the location was within walking distance from metro stations and main attractions and our room had fantastic facilities.  The perfect end to our honeymoon - thank you Alma :)",5,2015,07,26
40,Loved it,"Location - we loved it. It's not in the ""old town"" section so if that's what you want...but then it's only maybe 15 mins walk. We preferred the slightly less touristy location and therefor more ""local"" feel. It's still plenty close to everything, including easy walk to La Sagrada Fam, subway, shopping streets, and lots of restaurants/bars all over the place.
Service - friendly and helpful (although here and there when eating/drinking it could get a bit absent sometimes). But top notch overall.
Rooms - we had a junior suite facing the road (I think they all do). The room was lovely and comfortable. It was actually one big room with a divider (large piece of furniture) in the middle. Big nice bathroom with solid water pressure (altho when showering the water slowly leaks out onto the bathroom floor. nothing a towel didnt fix). Great with free minibar. As for road noise...let me preface by saying we're extremely sensitive and always travel with a white noise thingy. With that in mind, we would choose this room again. Road noise is indeed minimal, but def audible. With some white noise you cant hear anything. I would opt for higher floors. The regular rooms face the courtyard (not sure if this applies to all) and will be quiet for sure. 
Hotel - the breakfast/drink seating area was nice and relaxed. We did have breakfast here and although cheaper can clearly be had elsewhere it was very nice with a good selection and obviously convenient. The courtyard is an added bonus for dining/evening drinks and quite lovely. Thus, the ""hanging out"" areas are a clear plus. There is a terrace up top of the hotel, but we missed it (actually forgot about it).

Would def stay here again.",5,2015,07,21
40,Wonderfull hotel,"Very well located near Las Ramblas, this is a charming hotel, beautifully designed. Concierge service was awesome, very nice room. Breakfast is correct (although service can be slow at peak hours). Fitness center is very good",5,2015,07,19
40,Brilliant hotel in a great location,"We booked a suite for our ""mini-moon"" in July and loved every minute. The decor is fantastic, all the staff are really helpful, and the hotel is close enough to everything while also being far enough out to avoid feeling too 'touristy'. Definitely worth a visit!",5,2015,07,19
40,"Alma Barcelona - Perfect - Location, Staff, Rooms","We stayed at the Alma in June.  The room was perfect.  We stayed in a Junior Suite on the third floor facing the street, 301.  There were no concerns about hearing traffic.  The room was well appointed and had a large shower and a separate soaking tub.  I enjoyed the stocked mini bar and the nightly turn down service with chocolate and water left by the bed.  The courtyard was a perfect location to unwind or have a drink before heading out to dinner.  The terrace opened on the last night and it was amazing as well.  The only thing I would change is the breakfast buffet.  It didn't appear to be well attend to with signs up but no dishes available.  Also, the price of the buffet was more than I would have expected based on the types of food provided.  You could order eggs as part of the buffet but still didn't think it was worth.  Plus, there are so many great places near by to try.  I would definitely like to stay here again!  The staff was all very accommodating and booked the Picasso Museum and La Pedrera for us.  They also had great suggestions for nearby restaurants.  ",5,2015,07,16
40,Excellent,We stayed for 4 nights at the Alma in May.... It was excellent. This is a lovely boutique hotel in the middle of one of the nicest streets in Barcelona. The rooms were minimalist but extremely comfortable. The shower in the bathroom was amazing. The courtyard in hotel was perfect for lunch/drinks and just to hang out. All in all a lovely hotel and I will be staying here again on my next trip!,5,2015,07,16
40,the very best hotel of Barcelona,"this hotel is the hotel for nicest dreams of holiday or also business topics you can have. The service is overwhelming nice, every need or wish is fullfilled at once, but without penetrance. the rooms are in a perfect design and also condition. A cozy climatic makes the very right temperature. the furniture are modern, clear in structure and very comfortable. laying in the bed is a dream. The breakfast is from highest quality, you cannot do anything better- and indeed I know a lot of hotels in the world, but this is the best and you enjoy always a personal and private atmosphere. Thank you to all staff of the hotel!!!!",5,2015,07,15
40,Excellent stay at Hotel Alma,"Had a wonderful 3 night stay. Had a deluxe Queen room facing the garden terrace (back of the hotel). Rooms are nicely decorated, beds are very very comfortable, showers are excellent, free mini bar with water and soft drinks a nice touch. Only minor of the room would be no full length mirror which my wife found annoying. Roof terrace is nice - v slow service a minus point sadly. Spa is a shallow pool, steam room and sauna and a small minimally equipped gym. Not really a spa. but handy nevertheless. Lovely garden terrace - nice place to sit and have breakfast or a drink later in the evening. Food is excellent and for a nice hotel - fairly priced. Superbly located at the top end of the passig de gracia - casa mila is round the corner. Staff most friendly and happy to help. A great stay - we will most definitely return :)",5,2015,07,13
40,One  of the very best!,"I stayed at the Alma with a group of friends, we had three rooms, and all of us couldn't have had a better stay. The service, design, drinks, food, and general ambiance were all incredible. We will definitely be returning to stay there. Highly suggest this hotel for visitors looking for a stylish high-end hotel in a great location.",5,2015,07,13
40,Perfect stay!,"Best hotel of our five week trip through Europe at a very reasonable price. Loved the location too. Very professional and friendly staff that was very willing to help with all of our needs during our visit to Barcelona. Saray was absolutely amazing at the front. The room was huge and the beds so comfortable. The interiors are very modern and soothing. Do not miss the rooftop lounge and though pricey, the breakfast is worth it. We will be back to this hotel. I highly recommend. ",5,2015,07,13
40,Quiet Oasis in Barcelona,Modern hotel in great part of Barcelona. The garden is a beautiful place to eat or have a drink. You would not even know you were in a city. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Within comfortable walking distance to many sights of interest and good restaurants.,5,2015,07,12
40,Relaxed and unassuming,"It's very difficult to add any further to what has already been written and published on TripAdvisor for the Alma. I can only add to the many reviews extolling the virtues of this excellent hotel.

My wife and myself spent here for four nights during June 2015 and rate this among one of the best hotels in which we have stayed anywhere. It is a very unassuming, relaxed but, at the same time, quietly efficient hotel. It's decor and the general environment is very understated, yet remaining very professional, 

Staff were very accommodating and friendly. Our room on the fifth floor had a street view but external noise remained at a minimum. Size of room was more than adequate, with free and fast WiFi, free mini-bar and air-conditioning. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but this was not a great issue. The bathroom was of good size - no bath or fixed shower but a hand-hand shower in a wet room. A bath would have been an added bonus but, overall, not a problem.

The service in the dining area and bar was excellent. Breakfast was a treat, all very fresh, and the evening dinner menu represented excellent value for money. Do take advantage of the inner courtyard area - a veritable oasis of calm following a day exploring Barcelona.

Meanwhile, the Alma's location is superb, with major shops and places of interest only minutes away and the metro only a short distance from the hotel. 

When we return to Barcelona in the near future, the Hotel Alma is our first choice for accommodation.",5,2015,07,12
40,"Chic hotel, wonderful service, great position","This is a modern, arty hotel, well-placed in the city.  Being modern, the soundproofing, a/c, lifts, room facilities etc all work - and are of high quality.  The check-in and concierge staff are welcoming, polite and ever-ready to please.  We got a smile from every staff member we met and they seem genuinely welcoming, rather than doing it because management told them to...
Our room was a mini-suite with a lounge area separated from the bed by a chest-high set of cupboards, so though it was only one room, it felt like two.  Our room faced the street but road noise rarely penetrated.
It is very well-placed to explore the city - we spent four nights there and would happily spend longer and use it as a base for regional tours. 
The restaurant (we only ate breakfast in-house) and bar service was excellent, if a bit dear.  There's a very spacious garden / terrace at the back - but when we were there it was being used for business receptions every evening (if booking a room overlooking the garden there may be evening music noise, though its unlikely to be very late or loud).
No pool available when we visited.
Very highly recommended.",5,2015,07,12
40,Gem in the Heart of Barcelona,This hotel is simply first rate.  From arrival check-in to departure we could not have asked for a better experience in a hotel in the centre of a great city.  The room was spacious with every amenity needed and when combined with the tranquil garden made for a great stay.,5,2015,07,10
40,Fantastic little hotel,"We searched TripAdvisor and Alma Barcelona was highly rated, so we bit. What a great find in a convenient neighborhood. 
The staff, especially Quentin our concierge, was extremely competent and helpful. The room was spacious and sparse but in a good way. The courtyard is lovely and peaceful, and a great place to unwind after a busy day seeing Barcelona. 
The spa is clean and has a tiny pool, sauna and steam rooms. 
Fingerprint entry makes keys or keycards unnecessary so you can always run back to your room. 
One drawback- the breakfast spread is excellent but not included. ",5,2015,07,10
40,"Great location, nice hotel, and lots of helpful staff","Modern hotel with good amenities and comfortable, clean rooms. Great location, walk to lots of spots and also close to metro. Only strange thing is the pool which is located in the basement and feels more like a large bathtub with a low ceiling. Fitness facility is very small too but nice locker rooms. Food is pricey. Check in staff at front of hotel are extremely helpful and gracious...great language skills too.",4,2015,07,10
40,Top quality hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel was absolutely top notch. It is extremely modern, but some of the features they offer are really nice. The location is perfect. We would definitely stay here again. The rooms are all very quiet. The courtyard below is a great place for a quick bite to eat or an afternoon cerveza. ",5,2015,07,09
40,Very nice hotel. Great staff!,"The hotel and room were exceptional. The staff is the friendliest you will ever meet. From the time you get to the front door to the time you leave, you are very well taken care of. They go out of their way to pamper you. Doors are opened for you, luggage is carried for you. The food and food service was also very good.",5,2015,07,07
40,Favorite Hotel of our European Vacation,"We stayed at the Alma Barcelona for two nights, June 25th and 26th, and absolutely loved this hotel.  The favorite of our two week visit to Europe. What we loved about it is the high quality, simple and soothing atmosphere (Barcelona is so busy, it was nice to come back in the evening to such ""calm"").  Great location, about a 20 minute or so walk to the La Sagrada Familia, located on the same street as the hotel. What sets this hotel apart is its extraordinary staff.  My husband is in an electric scooter, and the staff literally bent over backwards to be of assistance to him.  As we were leaving to go back to the airport, the manager, Elisabeth, came to speak with us about our stay.  I've never been at a hotel where the hotel manager took the time to do that.  I wish I could remember the names of the staff, but they were all terrific.  Had a lovely dinner in the outside courtyard.  The sangrias were also fantastic! The hotel is in a great location, but it is truly the caring staff that sets this hotel apart from the others.  Hope to return to Barcelona one day, and will stay here again.",5,2015,07,06
40,Lovely hotel in an amazing city,"Everything about the Alma hotel makes me smile. The interior design and architecture; the large, comfortable rooms and cozy bed; the small but adequate indoor pool. The hotel staff went out their way to welcome us, and always willing to help. they gave us great traveling recommendations as well. The hotel has a lovely garden off the lobby and perhaps had it not been raining when we visited, we would have had our breakfast out there.
The location is convenient as well and in the center of everything, but not loud and crowded.",5,2015,07,06
40,Great Hotel to Discover Barcelona,"The Alma Hotel is centrally located and easy to get to from the airport by public transport. It's central location just off Passeig de Gracia, makes it convenient, even on foot, for many of Barcelona's iconic and top visitor sights. There are also many designer shops in the area, excellent local coffee shops for breakfast and pastries and a wide range of very good tapas and other restaurants, ideal as we opted to eat out.
The hotel itself is wonderful, understated with a large garden and very peaceful. Our room, upper floor and at the front of the hotel, was nonetheless very quiet, minimalist but very comfortable and spacious with separate shower room and toilet. Ladies might find the lack of a full length mirror frustrating ! 
The room was cleaned daily and the minibar, filled with mineral water, soft drinks and cerveza was free, and replenished daily, which in the heat was a very welcome facility. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the pillows and duvet were down-filled and beautifully light and soft. The in room air-con is very efficient and easily controlled.
The communal corridors are kept very clean and tidy and are decorated in very calming dark shades with subdued lighting. You can opt for finger-print operated door ""keys"" which saves worrying about losing a traditional key.
The ""spa"" in the basement is kept very clean but we found the pool a little too shallow for exercise swimming. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Overall this is a wonderful place to stay - highly recommended !",5,2015,07,05
40,Great location and excellent hotel,"The location of the hotel is superb just few steps from Passeig de Gràcia, very close to all the central attractions of the city. 
The hotel is a bit pricey but the room was very specious and well designed, the bed was great and the bathroom was luxurious. 
Since I prefer the local cafés I didn't try the breakfast in the hotel.",5,2015,06,27
40,5 Days in Barcelona,Excellent location. Beautiful hotel. Fantastic service at the front desk. Beautiful room. Kept spotlessly clean by housekeeping. Slightly odd that gym only open 7am to 9 pm with only one running machine. Lots to see and do in Barcelona so I did my exercise outdoors. All the great reviews about this hotel are right. Thank you Alma Hotel for an amazing stay.,5,2015,06,25
40,First stop,"For our first stop in Spain after the long haul from Australia this was a perfect hotel and location. Out of the old town but in the beautiful Eixamle barri it meant there was room for a spacious gardening in which we could enjoy a coffee and stretch our legs while our room was being made up for our very early arrival. Professional staff, quiet room with the softest pillows I have ever come across! Loved it.",5,2015,06,25
40,Beautiful hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at Alma. The room was beautiful and very big and you could see the rooftop of Casa Milla from the window. The blankets and pillows are amazing. Breakfast was delicious with a nice selection of pastry, cheese and bocadillos and fresh juice. The outside terrace is beautiful and perfect to relax and hide from the warmth but the service on the terrace is very bad.
And you can choose to open your room with your fingerprint ID. How cool is that?",4,2015,06,22
40,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"My friends and I recently spent 3 days in Barcelona and I chose the Alma based on Trip Advisor reviews, price and location. It is a great hotel. Very 4 star for a reasonable price. From check-in to check-out the staff was helpful in every way. The rooms, with their fingerprint locks, are spacious and well appointed. The music in the hotel was always soft and soothing. The indoor bar, restaurant and outdoor seating areas were all extremely comfortable, with table and seating well spaced. Just a great hotel.",5,2015,06,21
40,Amazing an personal service,"The Alma hotel is beautiful and central, but what really makes it stand out is the staff's constant attention to all of the guests.  Nothing is ever too much trouble and everything is done with a warm and welcoming smile.

Other plusses are the interiors and the hotel's garden, a fair book collection and a very good breakfast.  My only slight complaint was that breakfast took a short while to arrive (it is served, not entirely buffet style), which was a problem since we had morning appointments, but it was on the other hand very good.",5,2015,06,21
40,Just perfect!,"Location, standard of hotel, cleanliness of room, service level and atmosphere - everything was just perfect at this hotel. The garden restaurant is a perfect place to relax in the afternoon or in the evening. We often go out for breakfast, but the one you get here is really worth staying in for. It does not have too many rooms, never felt too crowded at the hotel although it was fully booked during our stay. A new favorite in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,20
40,Best Barcelona Hotel,"Wonderful and friendly service at Reception and in the restaurant. Rooms are spacious and airy with very comfortable beds, and beautiful bathroom. The hotel staff are very efficient and knowledgeable and the restaurant referrals we were given by them were excellent. We had the pleasure of meeting Saray Serradilla who works at Reception who was very welcoming and helpful. We will certainly return to this lovely hotel and recommend it to all discerning travelers.",5,2015,06,18
40,"Very different, but nice","The Alma Barcelona is very different from what we expected. Upon arrival, you are greeted very cordially by the doorman and front desk staff. The front desk staff sit behind two desks in front of which you are seated on a sofa. Your luggage is whisked away to your room while you check in sipping cava. You have a choice of having a traditional key for your room or to have your fingerprint as your key. Our thumbprints worked great and it was nice not having to even think about a key.

The hotel is very dark. This might be disconcerting for some but we got used to it. Everything seems to be black, except the spa, which is completely white. The halls make you feel like you're walking through the unfinished Death Star. 

The rooms are huge. We had a king bed. As in Madrid, the bathroom is basically in your room and there is no privacy, except this time, the toilet was separate. Still, there is no door to the shower and you can watch your mate shower. You get used to it, though.

The room has a charging station for your phone and USB ports. I borrowed a converter from the front desk so I could plug in my own. There is also a laptop sized safe.

One nice bonus feature is the stocked mini bar which is free. It has cold beer, juices, water and soda and is stocked every day. A nice touch. Wifi was free as well.

The hotel is in a great location. Very close to the subway and walking distance to many of the sites. We were able to walk all the way down to the sea without a problem. It was also very safe. The spa is a little bare, but has a nice exercise room, a sauna, a steamroom and a small pool. A hot tub would have been better. Spa services were available for additional cost. We didn't use the hotel restaurant, but it looked busy most nights.

All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Alma Barcelona. However, we might try another hotel the next time we are there. I've attached a picture of the hallway and the view from our room.",4,2015,06,14
40,Excellent,"Everything is of the highest quality, from the mattress to the pillow to the room size, ete. It is a very quiet and relax ing hotel that had the feeling of  a twon house in the nicest neighborhood of Barcelona. It is centrally located very close to the Sagrada Familia and to the Gaudi masterpieces. The service is discreet and efficient I cannot praise it more. We were very happy with the entire stay and we were guests of this wonderful hotel for 6 nights. Will definitely return.",5,2015,06,14
40,Good Hotel in great location,"This hotel has modern decor inside a traditional facade. Rooms are comfortable although the open plan bathroom is not to everyone's taste. Beds are comfortable, rooms are clean and service typical of a hotel of this standard.
Where the hotel excels is the quality of its staff, They are friendly, knowledgeable and very professional, anticipating rather than only meeting guests' requirements.
The restaurant was also very good and the tasting menu represents excellent value.",5,2015,06,14
40,Great location and service,We stayed here three days and had a wonderful time. The service was excellent.  The room was very clean and nice. We ate lunch at the restaurant on the patio one afternoon.  The fish was amazing.  We were one block from the Gaudi houses and 20 minute walk from Sagrada Familia and Placa de Catalunya.   Would stay here again on our next trip to Barcelona but would come earlier to avoid the hot weather.,5,2015,06,13
40,Short break great hotel ,"We stayed for 4 nights at the end of May 2015 
We had a double room over looking the inner courtyard of the hotel 

Room - spacious, comfortable bed, plenty of storage , large bathroom and big walk in shower with high quality toiletries which were replaced as needed
There was a safe, free shoe cleaning service and a fridge with complimentary water, soft drinks and beer that was topped up daily 
Room entry was with the use of a fingerprint which generally worked well

Wifi - effective throughout the hotel and accessed via a free code which was provided without needing to ask when we checked in 

Restaurant 
We ate lunch once outside in the restaurant - service as efficient and the food was of high quality and prices reasonable for the hotels quality - it was lunch so we only had some bread and main course
Breakfast - we had this once in the restaurant and once in the room - there is a wide selection and in the restaurant operates as a buffet. 
Service again was quick - when we ate on our last day it was quite quiet in the restaurant - this was perhaps the only time where service came with less of a smile than we had come to expect 
Price wise for me breakfast was slightly expensive at €25 - suppose it depends how much you eat ? If you have a big appetite in the morning you could certainly eat €25 worth. Quality wise everything was excellent. Being a buffet we didn't take anything with us but that was more possible in the room service breakfast 
We found once we had eaten our fill we had some small ham rolls and pastries left on the tray in our room which became our lunch and this seemed a better value way of having breakfast for us 

Gym/pool 
We used this a few times 
Excellent facilities - although small - single cycling, running and rowing machines - I never saw anyone else in the gym and never more than one person had used the machine on the days I went (from the history on the machine ) 
The pool was shallow but quite long and there were a couple of loungers as well as plenty towels, dressing gowns and water in a fridge in the gym, changing facilities excellent with showers and toiletries 
Only negative was the ceiling looks quite rough like it's not been finished - concrete tiles - stands out from the rest of the excellent decor 

Staff
With the one breakfast exception everyone was friendly, warm, helpful - there was some disruption when there appeared to be a photo shoot in reception but our dinner reservation was still booked successfully - they are happy to recommend restaurants if you ask 

Location - we found it excellent - close to big shops next to the Main Street and one street over from the ramblas - old town about 30 min walk and about 40 mins to port - obviously quicker on the metro - nearest station only a few steps away 

All in all this was a great place for a luxury short break and we would have no hesitation in returning if we visit again 

",5,2015,06,13
40,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, friendly staff and a central location. The room was nice but it was not a 5 star luxury hotel. I expected much more. We left Ibiza and check-in to the Alma in the afternoon and flew home the next morning. It was all very nice but I thought it was overrated. Or maybe my expectations were too high. 

The week before we had stayed 3 nights at a beautiful B&B just a few blocks from the Alma at half of the price.",4,2015,06,12
40,Alma is fantastic,"Alma Barcelona is a wonderful boutique hotel in a fantastic location in Barcelona Spain. The beds and bathroom were very nice but the main feature in the location and the service. Location is in a very upscale area of Barcelona close to everything and the staff will go out of their way to help you in every possible way. You cant go wrong staying here. Also they give you a complimentary mini bar with free water, beer , juices and soda",5,2015,06,10
40,"Definitely not a 5 star, more like 10.","This is our second visit, hopefully not the last. From the moment you arrive you are greeted as though you were royalty. The hotel is in a fabulous location, walking distance to shops and great restaurants. Extremely clean, attentive staff, charming back garden area for sipping your wine, and nice size rooms. I highly recommend The Alma Hotel.",5,2015,06,09
40,Amazing,"Stayed at the Alma in 2013 and had a great experience.  So good that we decided to go back.  This was dangerous as our expectations were set very high from 2013.  Well, they exceeded our expectations.  The staff is friendly, helpful, caring and makes us feel right at home.  Cannot praise them enough.  The roof bar and patio was closed and not due to open for a week or so later.  One of the front desk staff insisted on taking us up to the roof and went out of her way to show us around. Their dining recommendations were spot on. And Marcos was there like Radar from MASH, whenever we needed him! Spent some time in the rear yard area, just relaxing. My wife and I decided that next trip to Barcelona will be a longer stay at the Alma and skip the cruise ship.",5,2015,06,09
40,"Second visit, even better than the first","I was in November 2014 for the first time and I came back in May 2015.

This hotel is something different in Barcelona. Not just for the location, the rooms, the bathroom... This time I have enjoyed a LOT the bar and the patio. AMAZING.

The rooms are very very very nice and confortables and the bathrooms are great.

The best part of this hotel is the service offered by the employees all around the hotel. They treat customers as it should be in every 5 star hotel. Congratulations.

I will be returning here every time I will be in Barcelona.

If you are deciding between this hotel or Majestic or OM, don't hesitate to give it a try to the ALMA. You won't regret.",5,2015,06,08
40,Fabulous Stay,Hotel Alma is all that it says and more; an absolute pleasure from our booking to our departure. The staff were amazing and always obliging.  The rooms are spacious with lots of storage and there was always plenty of complimentary beverages to choose from. The hotel is centrally located with quick access to the metro subway station; we would totally recommend this hotel.,5,2015,06,07
40,Not five star,"They claim to be a five star hotel, but they are far from it. We stayed here back in may and here is what I think of the hotel:

Location
The best thing about this hotel was the location. It was off the Passeig de Gràcia and in the middle of all the action, shops and a couple of the Gaudi sites. A 15 minutes walk from the airport bus.

Arrival
There was no doorman opening the door.
They offer a beverage upon arrival, which was nice.
Some of the staff were not friendly.
Asked for a quiet room and was given a room facing the courtyard and Casa Mila, 
which was nice.
You had a choice of a key or your fingerprint to open your room. Their device could not detect our fingerprints, so we had to carry a very large key. Really? in 2015 you have to carry a large piece of wood with a key!

Room
It was minimalist to the extreme.
The air conditioning was loud and did not work properly.
The shower looked nice and had a rain shower head, but due to the piping, it was loud when the water was running
The flooring was hardwood and because of the mixture of moisture and hardwood, the toilet door was hard to open. We reported that and nothing happened. One of the staff came and looked at it but that was about it. I asked them again and they had no answer for me. Imagine, in a middle of the night, fighting to open the toilet door. 
The mattress was fine but the pillows were limp. The bedding was odd and you had no sheet between the mattress and the cover. How hygienic is that?
The lighting system was bizarre and not user friendly.

Bathroom amenity
No shower cap, cotton balls, Q-tips, magnifying mirror. 

Housekeeping
Was pretty good, they did a good job of cleaning the room and they left a little chocolate square every night.

Beverage in the room
They provided free beverages in the room. Water, sugary so called juice and beer. 

In the end I would not return, considering the prices they charge.",3,2015,06,07
40,Nice quiet hotel with excellent location,"We stayed at this hotel from May 14 - 16. We took taxi from airport around noon time. It was a little bit conjested. It took more than 30 minutes to get to the hotel. We were surprised that the hotel located at a resonable quiet street, even though it is close to downtown area. The room is simple and extremely large with marble bathroom floor. The bed is very comfortable. The hotel is two blocks away from Cerveseria Catalana (we had lunches for both days). I had a dinner reservation with Lasarte on May 14. Lasarte is only half of a block away.",5,2015,06,06
40,May 2015,Selected this hotel from reviews on TripAdvisor.  It is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in in years.  The hotel staff is so nice and helpful.  The rooms are modern and very spacious and quiet.  Positioned in the high end area of retail stores and very nice restaurants.  Far from the maddening tourist crowds but walkable to the main sights.  Stop looking and a book a room here.,5,2015,06,06
40,One of my Top Hotels...,"I stayed here with my wife as a Surprise for a friend's 40th birthday. 

Booked my hotel using my Expedia credit and got a savings of $300 towards the room rate. We booked the Junior suite and we got two rooms next to each other on the 3rd floor facing the front of the hotel. Both rooms still a further door outside which we kept shut most of the time and left our doors open so we had more space. 

The rooms are very spacious with a living and bed area divided with console and two 40 inch televisions on both sides. We had free stocked mini bars which was replenished daily. Beds were made anytime we left the rooms. 

It's a very nice boutique hotel in a great location just off the Passeig de Gràcia. Right at the junction you have Loius Vuitton and Cartier Store and Hermes on the opposite side. All the other luxury goods stores are right on that street to the left or right. Perfect location. 

Las Ramblas is walking distance to the left. We totally enjoyed our stay at the hotel and looking forward to returning to Barcelona for a third time.",5,2015,06,06
40,Centrally Located,"Centrally locate steps away from la Pedrera casa Batllo and shopping in Paseo de Gracia. 
The room we stayed in was quite large overlooking the street. It was very calm. I guess the double glazing did help. We only had breakfast and it was quite good a bit disappointing that there are not too many regular tables with a regular height. Most of them are large coffee tables with comfortable settees by the side. Call me old fashion but I still like old days comfort. This visit was in January so we had to have our BKFST in doors, probably as from spring you can have your meals served on regular tables in the out side terrace, which is very nice indeed.",4,2015,06,05
40,Garden of Eden,"What a lovely upscale hideaway just one block off the main street. From the moment you walk in you notice the difference. There is no front desk, instead there is a relaxing area where you can check in while enjoying a glass of Cava. The King room had contemporary, yet very comfortable, furnishings. The bed was ultra comfortable.
The restaurant is indoor/outdoor and the bar is very eclectic. But the best part of this hotel lies beyond the restaurant where there are comfy chairs for two in dimly lit areas in the garden. Truly it is breathtaking. 
I understand that the roof top bar surpasses the Garden of Eden, but it was scheduled to open in June and we were too early. We plan a return to Barcelona just to have another wonderful experience at the Alma.",5,2015,06,04
40,Wonderful stay at Alma Barcelona,I stayed at the Alma for 5 nights at the end of May 2015. From the first moment that we arrived at the hotel and were checked in by Xavi we felt utterly taken care of. Nothing was too much trouble for the kind and friendly staff. Our room was facing into the wonderfully peaceful courtyard and was very tranquil. The rooms are well appointed in a minimalist way. Extremely clean with very comfortable beds. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is close enough to the action to be able to walk everywhere but just far enough away to be a haven. The Eixample district is extremely elegant with plenty of interesting bars and restaurants. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2015,06,04
40,Quite ,"This hotel is very quiet and makes you feel like home. the location is very convenient for shopping and dining also within walking distance from other attractions. 
Rooms are simple yet sophisticated I like the idea of the wooden curtains. 
Breakfast is very nice with good choices. 
the garden is nice for breakfast and afternoon tea. 
The pool is located in the basement with no proper ventilation. 
One negative point I have sent some clothes for pressing because they won't provide iron and ironing board and the ironing they did was bad, I have complained about it and they still charged for it.

Overall the hotel and the hotel staff are very nice. ",4,2015,06,04
40,Perfect location right in the center of Barcelona and very quiet place,"Have stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Nice welcome at the reception, has never before experienced to be sitting down through check-in but you do here, really nice. Very serviceminded staff in general. Great room, really nice decorated and nice furniture. The garden-area at the hotel is great, wonderfull place to get a drink or eat. Would be happy to return again. The fitness and swimming pool is though so small that it is not worth mentioning.",4,2015,06,03
40,Stylish Boutique Hotel,"Not much to say about a quality minimalistic stylish 5 star boutique hotel
Perfect location and good non-intrusive service.
The hotel was fully booked but was very chilled.
Stunning terrace outdoor lounge/ bar in a beautiful garden.
Staff are super friendly and efficient",5,2015,06,03
40,Great hotel in a fantastic area,"A lovely modern Hotel in an idealic area of Barcelona.
The staff were what made this hotel, with Sophia making our every morning!
The Rooms wee a little small, but the bathrooms great!
Highly recommended!",4,2015,06,03
40,Great place for a few days in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Alma for three nights prior to leaving on a cruise.  It was fabulous.  The hotel is centrally located within easy walking distance of laRamblas, Gothic Quarter and is in the higher end shopping district.  Lots of very good restaurants in the area and it's just blocks from the most famous Gaudi buildings.  The people at the hotel couldn't have been nicer.  We had an executive suite.  It was very nice with plenty of room to just lounge after a long day of being out seeing the sites.  The bathroom was terrific with plenty of room for two people to get ready at the same time.  

We didn't eat in the hotel, except for breakfast the last day.  Breakfast was very good with everything that one would expect in the European breakfast.  We did have drinks one night in the outside garden area, which was lovely.

The hotel is clearly more of an upscale ""business"" hotel than it is a quaint local hotel.  We debated some about this versus one of the hotels in the Gothic Quarter.  After having visited, I'm very glad we didn't go with the Gothic Quarter.  It's pretty noisy with so many people around and the very narrow streets make it extremely hard to get around with luggage.  When you're away for almost 3-weeks, there's a lot of luggage.  

I certainly wouldn't hesitate to return to the Alma should we find ourselves in Barcelona again.",5,2015,06,01
40,Friday hotel ,"Staying in this hotel make you feel like home, very quite and comfortable. The hotel staff are very friendly and nice people , the hotel location is very convenient for shopping, dinning and walking. 
Rooms are simple yet sophisticated 
Very comfortable and quite with unique wooden curtains. first hotel I have seen using finger print to access the room.
The hotel garden is simple and comfortable. 
Breakfast is very nice.
I would strongly recommend this hotel for people prefer to stay close to the attractions . ",5,2015,06,01
40,Alma Hotel Barcelona,"The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. They willingly helped us find restaurants, reservations to museums and arrange local transportation. The rooms were spotless, spacious and well appointed. The area the hotel is in is perfect, away from the riffraff of La Rambla and yet in walking distance to all the best sites. This is were I will stay the next time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2015,05,30
40,Alama Hotel Barcelona,"We have travelled a lot and this hotel was right up there with all the boxes that needed to be ticked. Service, location, Price, Standard, Location.
We loved our time at this hotel and would recomened staying here, our rating out of all amenities would be 9/10.
Will be back and fully advise you to give it go.",5,2015,05,29
40,Lovely hotel,"We had a great stay during our trip to Barcelona. The staff was helpful and courteous, the rooms are well appointed and the location is ideal for sightseeing and shopping. Sophia at the front desk was extremely helpful.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there were some parties in their garden at night that we could hear from the room. They didn't last too late and it was a minor inconvenience considering how green everything else was.",4,2015,05,28
40,A Perfect Hotel,"Spent all last week at this lovely hotel and it exceeded every expectation we had for our stay in Barcelona. The prime location, the hotel's sleek design, its serene garden, the minimalist-styled rooms and the extra comfortable beds...they all created a wonderful experience. And the staff was superb. My favorite hotel stay of all my European trips.",5,2015,05,27
40,"Wonderful hotel, great location, beautiful city","Alma is a stylish, smart, and warm hotel with wonderful people and top notch service.  Elisabeth, Quentin, and Xavi made our trip extra special with their warm hospitality, great recommendations, and attention to detail.  The garden is gorgeous, the spa was great, and the food and drinks were always tasty.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,2015,05,27
40,Great trendy hotel and good central location,"Great shopping district, which my wife loved, and close to terrific food establishments and gourmet outlets.

This hotel is good and central with in easy walking distance from markets, shops and restaurants.

The rooms are great ( we upgraded to the next level up suite) with a separate sitting and bedroom area.

Plenty of room with well appointed facilities and a free mini bar.....and free wifi what a treat. Beds were really comfortable and made for a great nights sleep.

Service was efficient and discrete.
I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.

It is high end pricing but worth it.",5,2015,05,27
40,Fabulous Hotel,"I highly recommend staying at the Alma Barcelona. From the moment we were greeted at the door to the moment we left the experience was great. The hotel is modern and located in a great neighborhood with access to shopping, museums and restaurants.
Marco at the door was so helpful in making arrangements for restaurants, museums, cars and taxis. The staff at the front desk was also very helpful. We ate at the hotel a couple of times and the food was delicious.
The room was big and clean with lovely bedding.",5,2015,05,27
40,"Beautiful room, wonderful staff, fabulous rooftop terrace","We had a fabulous four days at the Alma - the location is perfect for going to all the Gaudi sites - most within walking distance and a quick cab ride to Las Ramblas and Barri Gotic. The moment we walked into the reception area, we were taken care of with expertise and thoughtfulness. The room was perfect - large, clean bathroom, big windows, quiet. We have stayed in several hotels in Barcelona and this is now our Go To location for future trips.",5,2015,05,27
40,Minimalist Luxury in the heart of Eixample,"We stayed a week at this wonderful hotel in the heart of Eixample, Barcelona's chic and most convenient neighborhood. From the moment we checked in to the time the cab to the airport pulled away from the curb, the service was attentive and flawless in execution. Our room, a superior overlooking the garden, was beautifully appointed in a clean minimalist design. I would call it Scandinavian Inspired with wide-board hardwood floors and muted colors. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was beautifully appointed and very functional having a generous bath, an oversized shower, and a separate water closet. The entire room was well thought and beautifully executed. We used the spa several times and the enjoyed the basement pool, it made for a nice break in the afternoon. The hotel has a restaurant but we only ate there once however the food was very good. The one thing that really stood out about our stay was the service. Everyone was very attentive, helpful and kind and this made our week at this urban oasis very enjoyable.",5,2015,05,27
40,First trip to Spain,"The Alma is located in the midst of  boutique shopping and easy walking distance to the Basilica and S. Familia, excellent restaurants and coffee shops.  The staff is gracious and helpful.  Breakfast is a treat.  The garden is lovely. Splendid choice.",5,2015,05,26
40,Chic & Classy Hotel in the perfect location,"We stayed at this hotel at the beginning of May for the weekend. 

The hotel was easy to find having got the airport bus. The hotel is just off the main road which holds of the the posh shops, Tiffany, Michael Kors etc 

As we walked into the hotel it is a dark grey colour decor which is really classy. We were met with a glass of bubbly as we checked in. 

There were some lovely places to eat within walking distance from the hotel. 

It take about 15 mins to walk Las Rambles. So the location of this hotel is fantastic. 

The Spa was such a bonus after spending hours walking all day. We would swim use pool, steam room and sauna which is great on your feet. There is only one treadmill but my husband ran whilst I swam. 

We didn't go out for dinner until 2200 hours each night as that was the time everyone ate.  We found a lovely roof top bar in the hotel  on the opposite side of the main road which was great to look at the views over Barca until the early hours. 

The hotel was fantastic find and I would definitely recommend this hotel. 

Quiet and very private. 

",5,2015,05,22
40,Barcelona Visit,"we loved this hotel.  Very attractive, great location, great rooms. The staff was very attentive and gracious. Couldn't have picked a better hotel. Don't miss the outdoor garden with live music and tapas at night.  Hope to return soon!",5,2015,05,22
40,"Chic, modern and comfortable in best location","Everything was good with this hotel. Starting from the very helpful staff and ""allergy friendly"" rooms to room comfort, cleanness, superb chic bar and hotel amenities (gym, steam room, restaurant). Location is even better as you are in the middle of the most posh and vibrant area in Barcelona, yet you are on a fairly quite street (luxury shopping street is just a few yards away). Rooms are of good size and bathrooms are quite big. Hotel cleanness is one of the best I've seen. Rooms are excellent for allergic people as they have bare modern necessities and no carpets nor cloth curtains.",5,2015,05,18
40,So nice,"From the check in to the check out we were treated like royalty. Staff is ultra nice and helpful. Rooms are perfectly clean, comfortable and spacious. Only issue is there's no outdoor pool but there's a cute garden. Location couldn't be better right in the heart of shopping/restaurant district. Great hotel! ",5,2015,05,17
40,"Location, location, location.","This unique contemporary boutique hotel is within walking distance to many important attractions.  The rooms are minimalistic, very clean and comfortable with no artwork.  But I'm not complaining, all the artwork is creatively hung from a floating mobile in a beautiful atrium which spans the height of the building and cascades to the lobby below.  Large windows on all floors make this visible as soon as you step out of your room.  Delightful!  We also had a view of the peaceful garden area of the hotel.  Superb service made for a very enjoyable stay.",5,2015,05,13
40,Incredible Stay!,We had such a wonderful time at this hotel.  It is so relaxing and peaceful.  The garden and spa are lovely.  The rooms bed was the most comfortable I have had in Europe and the bathroom was like our own personal spa.  Best hotel yet in Barcelona!,5,2015,05,12
40,Lovely,"Very nice garden, modern rooms in old nicely renovated building in luxury quarter of Barcelona. 

The gym is ok, with a nice addition: the have a TRX attached to the ceiling. 

The rooms are very quiet. Breakfast and food simple and excellent. 

I highly recommend it! ",5,2015,05,12
40,Lovely stay,"The Alma Hotel is in a great location with great service.  We could walk to the Boqueria, great restaurants and great shopping.  The rooms were immaculate and well appointed.
The only thing I found weird was that they did not provide those throw away shower caps or washcloths.  We requested them from the maid, but they never appeared.  The weird thing was that they used washcloths as hand towels in the hotel restrooms.  Ladies like to have a nice cloth to clean their faces.  For such a lovely property, I was surprised.  Other than that, it was a pure delight.",5,2015,05,09
40,"A little Gem. Great Location, helpful & friendly.","We stayed here about a year ago. The hotel is a cool, quintessential boutique hotel. The room we were in a Grand Deluxe room which was very large and comfortable, well appointed and quiet for good nights sleep. The hotel was quiet in general. 

The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant with local tips and the breakfast brunch was a massive treat. Held in the main room off the lobby, it was comfortable, with great background music and an absolutely wonderful way to start your day. It was gorgeous, filling and fresh. The service was helpful and prompt. Because it was packed, there were stations that ran out quickly like the fruit buffet or cheese but the staff were on it, esp. if you asked them. It set us up for the day. Having breakfast included in your rate is a MUST. Also the room has books and papers and wireless. It's incredibly comfy and civilized. 

The location was fab. We felt it really was in the centre of everything so we walked everywhere. We explored every neighborhood. We absolutely loved where we were placed. It was so convenient to the major shops and all the areas like Las Ramblas, Born, Grazia, Gothic Quater etc. We even waked to Gaudi Park (Parc Guell) which was in fact far (1 hour), but manageable because of the hotels location. It was a straight shot and we were able to walk through other neighborhoods and discover them that way. 

On another note - I have Celiac Disease and eating in Barcelona was a treat. We went to Copasetic and restaurant GUT in Grazia - both were delicious. Eating late is common but a lot of non-Catalonian Spaniards apparently don't buy into that 10pm meal anymore. We tried going local for the 1st two nights but it didn't suit us to be eating so late. We spoke to the concierge and he assured us there were plenty of places were we could have a fun, great meal and not feel out of place if we went at 8pm. He was right.  

Grazia and Born were our favourite neighborhoods. Very arty, relaxed with lots of great shopping and character. Grazia is less travelled because it's away from the touristy Las Ramblas but we loved that. It reminded me of the lower east side or west village before they were discovered. 

MAIN TIP: Barcelona is all Gaudi. We did the tours, say about 5 different tourist traps and were disappointed in all ...even in the park. It's not exactly like the travel stations show however.....the ONE event you do NOT want to miss is Le Sagrada Familia. Holy .... WOW. It is a wonder. Even my hyping it up won't ruin it. To see it is to believe it. 

If you do one touristy thing in Barcelona, go see Le Sagrada Familia. The other was visiting the city park - Parc de la Ciutadella. It's a plain park, very nice but what stopped us in our tracks & was a complete surprise was the celebration in the gazebo. It is a bandstand memorial of a transexual, Sonia Rescalvo Zafra, who was brutally murdered by neo-nazi's. This bandstand is a condemnation of that action and a celebration of human rights. The celebration is non-stop dancing in the gazebo. It was packed! Everyone dancing in & out, watching, no judgement, with partners and without. It was truly inspiring. 

If you want to really experience Barecelona - WALK. Explore & stay away fro the touristy, typical Barcelona sights/food in Las Ramblas which are overpriced. There is so much to see and do and if you want calm yet a great location with friendly, helpful service in a clean, cool, and generous boutique hotel, I highly recommend The Alma.",5,2015,05,08
40,Great location and staff too,"Stayed here for 2 nights and this hotel is awesome as so close to everything you can walk to. The hotel restaurant is great too. We ate lunch here and breakfast daily. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom in a suite room is spacious. They also have a mini fridge in your room that is stocked with water, beer and soda that is no charge to you which is a nice touch. We were on the 3 rd floor so street noise was not an issue. Turn down service includes chocolate which is very nice.  Definitely the place to stay in Barcelona. The check in staff is most helpful and you open your door with your fingerprint which is very cool. ",5,2015,05,08
40,Very close to the Ramblas and right in the centre of the shopping area (for my wife).,The hotel is very centrally located.  The staff was always very helpful and the size of the rooms was above average.  It is also very clean and the bar prices were cheaper than some of the shoddier places on the Ramblas.,5,2015,05,07
40,Awesome Alma,What a fantastic stay - we loved every minute.  The beds were very comfortable the rooms well appointed and clean plus the staff were super helpful (nothing was too much trouble) - we would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2015,05,04
40,Alma at its finest!,"Alma at its finest. Me and my friend stayed here for the bank holiday weekend as a treat for ourselves and we were certainly treated with great care. The hotel has a lovely relaxing feel to it with contemporary furnishings and upon arrival you are greeted by the staff who whisk your suitcase away to the rooms and a chilled glass of Cava presented to us. 
We booked a standard twin room for the stay and was upgraded to a deluxe room free of charge by the hotel. It just couldn't get any better than this. 
Staff were very attentive at the Alma and gave us lots if recommendations of where to have breakfast lunch and dinner if we didn't want to dine at the hotel. They were very helpful in booking reservations at restaurants for us and even loaned us a laptop to watch the Floyd vs Manny boxing match. Fernado was who we dealt with the most followed by Miguel and Xavi. These guys were brill! So kind and friendly and even gave us information about Barca in general.

They cartered to all our needs and I couldn't fault the hotel at all but one thing to note is to bring a travel iron as the hotel doesn't supply irons. We had our garments sent away for iron from which there was a charge. 21 euros for three items to be ironed (maxi dress, a top and linen bottoms) which we thought was a bit much considering they are a 5 star boutique hotel and that's the first time that's happened to me staying in a 5 star hotel. We was told it had something to do we safely regulations. Also the beds could have been a little firmer but everyone has different sleep comforts so that's my personal opinion.
The hotel is in a great location within the shopping district of designer shops high end and low end. Metro is nearby and everything is in walking distance. We never used a taxi to get around. 
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a long stay or short stay as they cater for everyone. We shall definitely be returning.",5,2015,05,03
40,Two night stay in Barcelona,"My friend and I booked a two night stay at Alma Hotel. The room itself was very clean, the drinks were complimentary which was great. We also used the spa in the hotel, which was nice. 
The staff were amazing.So thankful for Xavi, Fernando and Miguel. They were so helpful in recommending local restaurants, places to go and things to do. Very friendly in catering to our needs. We wanted to watch the Mayweather fight and they kindly lent us the hotel laptop. Stongly recommend you stay here. You will NOT be disappointed. Will be coming back again.",4,2015,05,03
40,Perfect for an amazing stay,"The friendly welcoming begins at check-in with a glass of Cava. The staff was always very attentive and happy to help with reservations for museum or restaurant. The Grand Deluxe Double Room was wonderful and luxury, bathroom with large Rain Shower, box-spring bed very comfortable, drinks in the minibar for free. The room faced the courtyard and was therefore very quiet. Also from the corridor could be heard no noise. There was an evening room service for making up the bed again.
The hotel is centrally located and many shops and restaurants are within walking distance.",5,2015,04,29
40,Highly recommend Alma Barecelona!! ,"This hotel is frequently rated as one of the best places to stay in Barcelona on travel bogs, and I couldn't agree more.  The location is perfect - away from the throngs of tourist crowds in the old city and in a nice shopping area very close to the Gaudi House. It is about a 20 minute taxi from the airport, and 5 minute taxi ride to the Sagrada Familia and old city.  We also walked back from both which is doable in nice weather and great way to see the city. 
The service at the hotel is exceptional from the moment of check in, and the staff is eager to recommend places or visit, restaurants, things to do, etc, as well as make reservations and pre-buy tickets for you. The rooms are modern, spacious and immaculate, and include complimentary juice, soda and bottled water. 
We didn't eat in the hotel at all, but the bar areas is very nice as well, and there is a great quiet private garden out back to eat and have drinks in. 
We also didn't use the pool, which was also very clean. Us odd in its location downstairs and inside. 
Overall, I cannot recommend this hotel enough for a great stay in Barcelona. ",5,2015,04,29
40,Perfection,"My husband and I got a 1 bedroom suite at this magnificent hotel. It was big (especially for European standards), BEAUTIFUL, and quiet. The hotel itself has a lively outdoor pool bar where we actually attended a free vodka tasting. We also ate breakfast almost every morning in the restaurant. It was a perfect way to start the day. The hotel is within walking distance to all of the major sites (Guell Park, Sagrada Familia, Picasso museum, etc.)  Also located right in the middle of a great shopping district. I have 0 complaints about this place and will stay here again when I return.

Also forgot to mention how wonderful the staff is. This is a tightly run organization. They were able to provide spot on recommendations based on our tastes....even when they changed from day to day.  We were also greeted with champagne upon our arrival and SAT for check in.  We were taken care of from the minute we walked into the lobby.",5,2015,04,28
40,5 Star tranquility,"The service was first class, good attention to detail, particularly on the front desk and when you enter the hotel. The rooms are modern, minimalist, but very relaxing. The alma is in a good position for enjoying Barcelona. Very happy with our choice.",5,2015,04,23
40,Totally happy with selecting this hotel,"I spent a great deal of time researching hotels in Barcelona because I am finicky about hotels in general and especially after a very nice 2 week cruise in which I know we will be spoiled.  Thanks to Tripadvisor reviews I finally decided on Alma Barcelona, as it turns out I couldn't be happier with my selection.  The hotel has a boutique feel but not overly small, I also like the clean modern design that still exudes warmth with a nice ambience.  The service is excellent, both Xavi and Marcos are extremely friendly and helpful with our check-in and request for recommendations.  Our room faces the lovely courtyard and the floor to ceiling glass door can be opened to let in fresh air.  Despite the location, which is right off the corner of the very busy Passeig de Garcia, the room is absolutely quiet.
Breakfast is first rate as well and we hope we have opportunity to try lunch or dinner but that will have to wait until our next visit.",5,2015,04,22
40,Stylish but lifeless hotel,"My partner and I were in search of somewhere new to stay in Barcelona, looking for a luxury boutique hotel, and on paper, Alma Barcelona ticked all the boxes. Sheek, stylish, lots of facilities. And it delivers these. However, the ambience is sterile, and the place is really dark. Really, really dark. Black corridors, black walls, and I have never been in a lift so dark in my life! We barely encountered any other guests during our stay. This may appeal to some travellers, but the hotel felt lifeless. It was an empty feeling, and wasn't inviting to return to after a day out in Barcelona. There is a careful balance between relaxing and lifeless, but the hotel was definitely the latter. The room was moderately comfortable, however dark wooden panels, wooden floors and wooden shutters limited the extent to which the room felt homely. In contrast to all this, the porter and reception staff were excellent, and very willing to help. However, once you walk past reception further into the hotel, the oppressive nature of the cold ambience takes over.

We decided to dine in the hotel restaurant for dinner, and this was probably the most underwhelming part of our stay. From the menus and prices, we were looking forward to a gourmet dinner, but we were left disappointed. The service was not pro-active, and lacked the 'can-do' attitude one would expect of a 5* hotel restaurant. Instead, the service was robotic and not attentive. They use the lounge for the restaurant, meaning you sit on sofas which are too low for the tables to comfortably eat. The food was very mediocre, and - picture attached - the portions were shockingly small. Not gourmet-style-small, just small. The (expensive) fish dish my partner ordered was so pathetic it was bordering on insulting. I spoke to the waitress about this who appeared indifferent to the situation, and I had to ask for the kitchen to make some more vegetables as the 10 tiny chopped pieces which accompanied the dish were comical. Of course, by the time they arrived, the fish was cold. All this meant the dinner was not the enjoyable experience it should be. 

I have stayed at much more homely and inviting luxury boutique hotels in Barcelona, and therefore, won't be returning here.",3,2015,04,19
40,ALMA means SOUL,"And this place has a soul. Right from the minute we stepped into the hotel, we were met by smiles and helpfulness. Service is excellent. We had Room 509 and from there, there is a beautiful view to the roof of la Pedrera. Also the restaurant has very good food. We had the tasting menu and is was fantastic.
The staff is always there for you and ready to do their utmost to help you. 
Rooms are a delight and elegantly modern.
We would certainly stay again and recommend it highly",5,2015,04,18
40,Service Makes A Difference!,"Our second stay at this stylish, understated and well located hotel. Lovely suite on the sixth floor with a balcony overlooking Carrer de Mallorca. All the facilities and amenities you would expect and hope for from a really good hotel. But it is so often the service experience  that makes the difference between good and great. Following an extended wait one morning for our order at breakfast, which prompted us to express our disappointment, staff went out of their way to make up for the incident, showing genuine concern to ensure that the quality of our experience at the Alma was not diminished. In particular, Elisabeth Coloma (Guest Relations Manager) personally made sure all was OK, from arranging for cakes and fruit to be delivered to our room, to the complimentary breakfast the following morning. From a minor incident which may have taken the shine off an otherwise great stay, the response of Elisabeth and her team was such that our experience was enhanced and our stay was better than ever. The Alma is a hotel where service really does make a positive difference. This is why we will return again.",5,2015,04,17
40,Special Romantic Weekend,"The Alma is a fabulous couples romantic getaway.  Very modern appointments and a very attentive staff.  The location is easy to get around, although a little inconvenient for the beach (plan on 10 euro each way to the beach).

The spa is nice with pool, steam and sauna.

40,Hip and Trendy Luxury,"What a wonderful place!  A welcoming glass of Cava, wonderfully attentive staff, amazing bathrooms and rooms and one of the loveliest gardens ever !  Food delicious, clientele hip, location perfect.  To top it all, the comfiest bed and the best night's sleep ever !",5,2015,04,12
40,EASTER WEEKEND BREAK,"From the moment we arrived with our welcome glass of cava the staff could not have been more attentive from opening doors to making restaurant reservations the service was excellent !
A special big thank you to Quentin on the front desk who was especially helpful, we will definitely return.",5,2015,04,11
40,Great location and superior services,"Everything met our expectations for a five-star - caring staff, prompt services, a spacious room, and delicious food. The only thing was that the showers were in open space, right next to the sink. The bathroom got all wet and slippery after we took showers. And wished there had been a sink closer to the toilet.",4,2015,04,07
40,Peacefull ans attentive,"From the time of arrival to departure my wife and I were made to feel most welcome by all the staff in this 5* Hotel.  On arrival we were given complementary Cava whilst checking in and having a very detailed brief of what was on offer in the surrounding area.  The room was spacious with a very large wet room shower type area, 2 sinks for individual use along with a single bath.. The toilet was in a separate room from the bath immediately off the entrance area.  The room came with a complimentary mini bar with soft drinks and 2 beers which were replaced everyday.  The food at breakfast was a cold buffet as well as a small hot breakfast menu with orders taken upon sitting down.  The inner court yard was also a very tranquil place to sit and relax following a day of sight seeing.  In summary a great Hotel where I would be happy to stay again.",5,2015,04,07
40,Lead a spartan life at Alma,"I booked a Grand Deluxe Room and found a spacious room with view to the Carrer Mallorca. The bathroom with separate toilet and a spacious shower offered daylight. The rooms are clean and soundproofed. The rooms are very sharply equipped – no paintings, no decoration, no magazines, no possibilities to store the suitcase (I found my suitcase on the floor) – just one chair – and this is it. Also in the bath – no extras. You might like it or not, for me it was okay. 
I did not like the bad smell in the bath in the morning, the very cold marble floor in the bath and the silverfish on the floor in the toilets. 
I did like the friendly and helpful staff; I love the perfect location of the hotel just next to Passeig de Gracia and the singing housekeeping lady in the morning (… others use the vacuum cleaner noise to make the guests finally leave the rooms so that they clean it).",4,2015,04,07
40,A Hotel to Look for,"My wife and I stayed there over Easter for four nights. The room was phantastic, the staff was super friendly, already during check in they explained everything we wanted to know for our stay. The hotel displays an excellent tranquillity and peacefulness which made us feel extremely comfortable. The location is also excellent, and the valet parking of our car was hasslefreee. All in all a place highly recommendable to stay.",5,2015,04,07
40,1st Anniversary Paradise,"My Husband and I visited Barcelona for our 1st wedding anniversary and chose to stay at the Alma based on previous reviews and I have to say it didn't disappoint, the service is 5* from the minute you arrive to the time you leave.  Nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms were beautiful, we had a fantastic view of the Casa Mila, the room itself was modern, spacious and immaculately clean equipped with phone chargers, hairdryer, top quality toiletries, large TV, free Wi-Fi and lounge area . The mini bar in the room is an added extra as is the welcome cava drinks.  All the staff were incredibly helpful, they arranged booking tickets to attractions for us, arranging dinner reservations, calling taxis and providing us with lots of information about the city.

I would defiantly recommend this beautifully understated hotel.",5,2015,04,02
40,Take advantage of excellent service!,"Have just returned from a 2 night stay in 2 neighbouring rooms at the back of this luxurious hotel. Outstanding understated service from the moment we walked in the door after early morning flight to Barcelona. Luggage whisked away to our rooms on our early arrival at 10am. No need to wait for rooms. Fingerprint room entry was really useful as we could enter each other's rooms without disturbing others by knocking on door! Rooms were very comfortable and had great views of the rooftop of La Pedrera and Tibidabo and the adjoining terraces. Very quiet at night. Breakfast was great and we also enjoyed cocktails in the bar one evening. Free minibar in rooms. Rooms cleaned when out & chocolate & water with weather forecast placed by bedside in evening. Asked Reception staff about a good restaurant for the Saturday night to celebrate daughter's 21st and they recommended and booked us a table at an excellent restaurant 5 minutes away which we would probably never have found. Excellent location within walking distance to Sagrada Familia and down to the main part of Barcelona. Easy to get anywhere on the metro. Found taxi for us instantly! Wished we could have stayed longer to make use of more of their facilities, restaurant etc!",5,2015,04,01
40,"Good value, large room and pleasant staff","We spent 5 nights in an executive room. The room, though dark (appropriate for modern day style) was large with a seating area separate from the bed. The bathroom was also large. There was no hand soap for the shower, but some was provided quickly upon request. The mini bar had some free drinks and the free water stock was ample. The location just off the Passeig de Gracia is great with just a short walk to shops, great Gaudi architecture and an easy walk to the Gothic section. The underground (Metro) is also close by. The staff was great with Elizabeth a stand out. We also had 1 nice dinner here. We enjoyed it so much we booked another stay for later in the year.",5,2015,04,01
40,A most friendly welcome,"A quiet, relaxing place right in town center, only minutes away from main attractions. Easy to reach by train from the airport. Perfectly friendly welcome by very professional staff, prepared to help with any requirement. A real oasis in the busy town centre of amazing Barcelona.",5,2015,03,31
40,Relaxing luxury in a great location,"You could quite easily drive by this wonderful hotel on the Carrer De Mallorca without noticing...this is a good point as the façade is understated yet smart. However, on being greeted at the foyer by one of the several smart, polite members of the Alma team, you know you're in for a treat!

A welcome drink whilst booking in, suitcase whisked off to your room, every detail of the hotel explained and a succinct guide to the surrounding area and local attractions... a great start.

The hotel is beautifully modern, entry to your room can be by fingerprint recognition, and our room was ultra spacious, clean, modern, quiet (located at the rear of the hotel overlooking the garden terrace), and had all the amenities and more that you need.

Downstairs is a neat restaurant and bar area leading out onto the heated terrace...grab a drink and relax on one of the comfortable sofas and take in the lovely, peaceful atmosphere.

When in Barcelona, the tendency is to go and explore the hundreds (thousands?) of varied restaurants (and quite right too). However on our arrival day, after an early start and plenty of walking around the city, we just fancied to plonk down in the hotel at night, and decided to eat in...do it!! The menu isn't complicated, but the food is fantastic...steak, fish, but if it's still on the menu, try the pigs cheek stew...you'll be gratifyingly surprised.

The location of the Alma is good too. At the top end of the Passeig De Gracia, with all it's designer shops, it's about a 20 minute stroll down into the heart of the city, or a couple of minutes on the Metro (Passeig De Gracia or Diagonal stations to Catalunya or Liceu stations if heading for La Rambla).

All in all, a super short break, highly recommended, go to the Alma and treat yourself!",5,2015,03,31
40,"Perfect hotel, service, location and design!","We booked an Executive Suite room.  The room was very quiet and faced the street which we enjoyed. Very well designed room, high quality amenities, bathrooms were very large and included a separate shower from the lovely tub.  Room itself was also spacious and beautiful.  Service and attentiveness of staff upon arrival and throughout the stay was excellent.  Friendly and helpful but not pretentious.  Location was very good, close to everything whether you want to walk or take the metro.  Very safe, upscale area.  High quality breakfast and worth the little bit extra to pay for.  The hotel furniture, design and decor is very high quality and beautifully done.  They also saved us by finding a taxi when there were no taxis to be found as we were trying to get to the El Clasico football game, even asking people to leave a cab so we could get in.  My thanks to the staff and hotel for the lovely stay.",5,2015,03,30
40,Classy hotel in superb location ,"I've been to Barcelona many times for business & pleasure over the years and stayed at plenty of good hotels and Alma hotel is definitely one of the better ones.

Classy and sophisticated decor, Central but also quiet and peaceful. It's a very good hotel with excellent service in general. The breakfast was also very good.

There was just a couple of points that I felt prevented this hotel from being a truly five star experience. Firstly the welcome glass of cava was warm and devoid of any fizz, if you're going to make a nice gesture on entry to the hotel, at least serve the drink chilled and not flat.

The other thing was the steam room in the spa was out of order all weekend and the Sauna only functioned on one of the days we were there too. That isn't great when you're expecting a functional spa. 

I'd still definitely stay at the Alma again though as its in s great spot and its a very chic hotel which is very calming as soon as one enters and on the whole, the service is excellent. 

",4,2015,03,27
40,The best service ever!!!!!,"Great hotel for sure and location second to none.,  But real beauty of this five star hotel is the service.  The staff is amazing. They will make it happen fir you  even booked Prado for me in Madrid. There is no other place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,03,26
40,Upscale sleek hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Very elegant, quiet hotel in the posh shopping heart of Barcelona.  Staff have always been polite, helpful and gracious.  The rooms are spacious, elegant bathrooms with rainfall showers, fast WiFi.  Rooms can be dark, lighting could be slightly brighter.",5,2015,03,25
40,Wonderful,We stayed here last year. Through the reviews from TripAdvisor. It was amazing . We usually only stay at boutique hotels & this didn't disappoint. We will definitely go back again.. It was close to everything we needed to do & see . Fab restaurants & shopping & of course  Gaudi..,5,2015,03,25
40,"""Perfect Stay""","The place is really very elegant and nice. The best part is staff, they are super friendly and supportive. Since we don't eat pork and beef, I even got my dinner customised everyday. The front desk staff was always available and discussed very friendly about attractions in Barcelona. This can definitely be a preffered stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,03,24
40,"Great, professional 5* hotel","All in all our stay at the Alma hotel was very good. After staying at the W last time I was in Barcelona, the Alma was a nice alternative. First, it's conveniently located next to the Passeig de Gracia, very close to the Plaça de Catalunya and all the shops and sights (e.g. la pedrera etc.) 
The rooms are spacious, very clean, the housekeeping is doing a very good job! We enjoyed the food and the cocktails, although the waiters sometimes didn't understand our English (we ordered black tea, got coffee instead, ordered a strawberry daquiry, the waiter brought cranberry juice) but we didn't mind, really. We definitely will be coming back to Alma!",5,2015,03,24
40,Nice stay with few issues,"Returned home from a very nice stay at Alma Barcelona.
The hotel is very much a designer hotel, cool, very modern and dark. 
Let me start by singling out the absolute best feature of the hotel: The attentive professional service offered by Elisabeth – se took a personal interest in making our stay as good as it could possible get!
Our stay was not without problems as the air conditioning was letting out a very unpleasant smell I our room. The hotel took swift action and after a failed attempt to fix the problem we were moved to another room. We were given a bottle of cava and a free breakfast to compensate for our inconvenience.
Apparently some of the technical solutions are however a bit too modern as the fingerprint scanners for opening the doors did not work for either of e nor my wife – a problem that did not surprise the front desk as it happened frequently. This leads me to asking why they have not done something to permanently solve the problem.
The bed in our Exec. Suite was perfect. Soundproofing of Windows could do with an upgrade.
In general we had a very enjoyable stay.",4,2015,03,23
40,Wonderful Hotel!,"My husband and I recently had a great stay at the Alma. First, it is in a great location to see all the key sights, Casa Mila is about a block away, we walked to Sagrada Familia.  Located near great shopping and Gracia neighborhood. 

From the moment you walk in the door, the service is top notch.  Front desk provided great sightseeing recommendations and dinner suggestions.  For great tapas check out La Pepita!

The rooms are impeccably clean and nicely decorated. I would stay here again if ever back in Barcelona.",5,2015,03,20
40,Nothing short of extraordinary,"I am well traveled and live in New York (i.e. my standards are pretty high).  I can honestly say that my stay at the Alma with my girlfriend was arguably one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.  From the decor, to the food, to the rooms to the extraordinary service from the staff there was a level of quality that surpassed most anything I've experienced.

The hotel is in a fantastic location with impeccable decor and amenities (the spa and indoor pool is such a hidden gem).  We stayed in an executive suite which was incredibly spacious and had a great little balcony and view of Passeig de Garcia so I can't speak for the standard rooms but ours was flawless.

Above all, the hotel staff is incredible.  From dinner reservations to massage appointments to transportation, they were so amazing and very responsive.  (It also didn't hurt that we received a glass of cava upon check in at 9:30pm)

Honestly, the Alma is extraordinary. I HIGHLY recommend it as home base in Barcelona.",5,2015,03,18
40,Very professional,"If you are the kind of person like me who values professional staff members over fancy (and often fake) bling-bling show-off hotels, you will love ALMA. Everything is very lowkey, minimalistic and still very luxurious. They keep the reception area discreet, private and personal, so you don't have that usual, annoying fuss and buzz which you find in almost every hotel lobby. Therefore, when you return to the hotel and open the front doors it almost feels like you are entering a private apartment complex. Though I have to say that I don't think the hotel was very busy at the time I was there in march.

The breakfast buffet is pricey, but it is well-composed. Not overwhelming but very inviting and delicious. You can surely find a much cheaper breakfast in the area, but Catalonians don't seem to eat that much breakfast, so I had to walk for a while before I found a café which was open before 9am and offered a full English breakfast.",5,2015,03,18
40,5 Stars-LOCATION LOCATION,"This place is my go-to Barcelona hotel at this point. We arrived early on a Thursday morning and our room was ready. It was beautiful and maybe one of the most comfy beds I have ever slept on. I was weary of the separate bedding on the king bed, but discovered that my wife and I loved it. The bathroom was huge with plenty of room for two to move around at the same time. The location of this hotel is ideal. Steps away from a tour bus stop and in a very good neighborhood with lots of shopping and eats. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The spa is minimal but very relaxing and a nice touch, especially after a long flight. The breakfast is delicious. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that can afford it. We went in the winter so the rate was very reasonable, just over 300 euros. I imagine in the summer this place is much more expensive. Either way, I don't think I could stay in Barcelona and NOT stay at the Alma.",5,2015,03,17
40,Excellent front desk staff,"Stayed for six nights in two different types of rooms: an executive suite and a grand deluxe. What we liked most was the staff. They really care for us and tried to help us in detail in everything: restaurant recommendations, museum reservations, and transportation. This kind of service is not easily found in other hotels. Room cleaning at some hidden corners can be a little bit better, but generally more than very good.",5,2015,03,15
40,Really great,"We really enjoyed staying at Alma Barcelona. Not cheap of course, but it really was an excellent hotel. The staff were very helpful, multi-lingual, always available, and just nice people to talk to.  The location was perfect in the middle of Barcelona. The room was very nice with a modern beautiful decore that was still entirely practical. We also liked Barcelona a lot as a city to visit - architecture and art museums. We visited in March before the tourist season got too crazy; that was a good idea. ",5,2015,03,15
40,Absolutely fabulous!!,"My partner and myself stayed at the Alma for my 21st Birthday. From  the moment we checked in, nothing was too much trouble. The room was fabulous, the bed so comfortable, the shower and complimentary toiletries were an added luxury, as was the minibar- stocked daily with water, fruit juices and beer. Staff were happy to share their knowledge of the local  area and recommended some fabulous places to dine out and visit. We are really looking forward to our return visit to the alma in Barcelona! ",5,2015,03,14
40,Impeccable Service,"We booked the Alma for 2 nights for my birthday and it was amazing! If you are looking for a big busy hotel with lots of hussle and bustle, this is not it. It's more like an oasis of calm conveniently located just off the main shopping street Passeig de Gracia.

From the moment we arrived, the service was outstanding. We sipped Cava as we checked in and the concierge explained all the attractions and offered to reserve any tickets that we would like.  

Our room was light and airy and overlooked the garden. The mini bar is complementary and has soft drinks and water and a couple of beers which they restock each day.

We had some cocktails at the bar when we freshened up and they were fantastic. We don't normally eat at the hotel we stay at as we like to explore but on the second day we were really tired and decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant. It was excellent! We loved it so much that we also had room service that night!

Overall, this place is great. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2015,03,09
40,Wonderful hotel and staff,"We stayed two nights in this lovely friendly hotel 30th Jan-1st Feb 2015 and from the moment we walked through the door we felt totally welcome and comfortable.  My husband and I, with our two adult daughters went to Barcelona to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday.  On arrival the concierge Marcos and receptionist Elisabeth greeted us and made us very welcome with a large glass of bubbly each, to enjoy whilst checking in.  Over the two days they both helped us enormously with information, nothing was too much trouble for them.   We were shown around the hotel, and taken to our rooms, our luggage having already been taken.  The rooms were very clean, modern, and equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Excellent that we did not have to pay for the soft drinks and beer in our mini bar.   We were in and out of the hotel during our stay, and each time we went or arrived back we were treated like royalty, doors opened for us, taxi's hailed, directions given,  restaurants and sight seeing visits booked, the staff were faultless in their attentiveness.  As others have said, when we left we felt like family and just wanted to return again as soon as possible.  It was our first visit to the city, and have put Barcelona to the top of our list to visit again soon, and will look forward to seeing everybody again at the Alma.  Thank you all.  The Daines-Smith family",5,2015,03,04
40,Fabulous Hotel,"My husband and I spent 6 nights in January at the Alma Barcelona and it was amazing. The staff, especially Elizabeth, could not have been more helpful or welcoming and went above and beyond to make our stay very enjoyable by providing recommendations for dinner and directions.  Our room was a suite and was fabulous. It was huge with all the amenities including an Apple computer. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a 5 star + hotel experience in a beautiful city.",5,2015,03,04
40,fantastic hotel experience!,"We had an amazing, week long, stay at Alma Barcelona; the hotel exceeded our expectations on all counts.  The staff was friendly, knowledgable, helpful, welcoming and clearly dedicated to making guests feel special and comfortable.  The food in the restaurant and staff there... wonderful as well.  By the time we left we felt like family!  The hotel itself is modern, impeccably tidy, perfectly located, and rooms/beds ridiculously comfortable. We loved our trip to Barcelona in large part because of the ease, comfort and wonderful staff at Hotel Alma... can't wait to return. Until then, we will heartily recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,03,02
40,Beyond expectations! Fabulous!,"We stayed for 3 nights in the Alma Barcelona from the 26th of February until the 1st of March 2015. We can absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone! I love to travel and I always try to pick the best hotels (5 star hotels with the best reviews on TripAdvisor). But the Alma Barcelona is beyond expectations in every way! I migth say that the Alma Barcelona is definitely the best 5-star hotel I ever stayed in! The staff is exceptional! They are very friendly and helpful and it already starts by entering the hotel and the check-in. They really take their time to personally welcome you with a drink and explain all the ins and outs of the hotel! The hotel is fabulous in every way. The overall atmosphere is great, the rooms are very spacious and clean. We had a Superior Room with separate bathroom with bath and rainshower. All very spacious. The spa and indoor pool area is wonderful and very relaxing. The breakfast is very good with a very wide range of products. We are definitely coming back to this hotel when we would visit Barcelona again. The location of the hotel is perfect! We did everything by foot. Thanks again for the lovely stay, Alma Barcelona! We didn't want to leave! Hendrik Lybaert",5,2015,03,02
40,Would definitely come back and recommend,"Pros
Number 1 is definitely the staff: They are very well trained and really want to help and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Special thanks to: Saray, Marcos, Elisabeth, Juan Carlos and the rest of the staff who went above and beyond their normal duties and making it a wonderful stay.

Cleanliness: the rooms and hotel are spotless. If a very clean room is important for you, definitely stay here.

Location: in the middle and walking distance to all major attractions,  restaurants, shopping...

Beds: comfortable bed, nice covers, lots of pillows

Free mini bar: it's only soda, juices and water, but it's still great

Shower: good shower

Cons:
I like to sleep with the window open to get fresh. On one side is the restaurant which plays music (nice music, not club music) till about 12:30 and on the other is the street which is quite noisy. If you close the windows you don't hear a thing. This is only a small issue if you like to sleep with the window open. Choose the restaurant/garden side, it's quite nice and less noisy with the window open than the street.

I would definitely come back and would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,01
40,Wonderful stay at the ALMA,"Four night stay in February.  Great location.  We were able to walk to many sights and shopping.  Staff was fantastic - a special shout out to Marcos, Elizabeth and Fernando.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there were so many terrific breakfast places within walking distance.  The hotel is very modern, sleek and dark.  We could have used a little more light in the room.  However, the rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable.  We faced the courtyard so it was also very quiet.  After a long day of touring, it was great to have drinks in the garden.  Highly recommend this property.",5,2015,02,26
40,Fantastic hotel,We recently stayed at the hotel and everything exceeded our expectations. It is in a great location for both exploring the city and for shopping. The rooms were large and comfy but the best part was the staff. Always ready to help and extremely friendly will ensure I will stay there again.,5,2015,02,25
40,Well located and Fantastic Staff,"We stayed for 4 days over valentines and the location is excellent - 10 minute walk to the ramblars -if that is your bag - but with  Versace et al on the corner and 2 Gaudi buildings within 5 minutes walk. The Sagrada Familia is just 20 mins away. We had a quite room overlooking the courtyard which was ideal. At first we were concerned at the wait for reception but we soon learnt that this was because the excellent Staff were so knowledgeable and could not have been more helpful. (So we apologies for anyone waiting behind us!).  

Even out of season the main sights of Barcelona are busy, and in some cases need to be booked a day in advance. Hence the importance of the excellent staff, who also recomended some superb restaurants ( especially the excellent Botafumeiro, approx 15 mins walk away). Overall Barcelona is a beautiful city and the stay was made all the more perfect by the choice of the Alma Barcelona. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2015,02,22
40,"Great location, reception staff good but let down by breakfast","We chose Alma due to the great reviews and to be fair if we could give a half mark I would say it's a 3.5 out of 5.

The location was great, very accessible to tourist attractions, shops, bars and public transport. The check in was efficient and very friendly. 

The room was nice but we felt too design led over function. Only one chair whereas if you both wanted to relax and watch TV a small 2 seater sofa would have been better. We liked the finger print room key, a very nice touch. The bathroom was a good size and it was good to have the toilet separate. There was limited hanging space but for a long weekend it was fine.

What marks the hotel down massively was the breakfast. Quite possibly for a 5 star hotel, it was one mod the worse experiences which was a real pity. We asked for tea and 15 minutes later we were still waiting! There were only 4 other tables in for breakfast, so it wasn't busy. There was no bread for toast, so I asked and 10 minutes later I was still waiting. There were no cornflakes. And the hot breakfast we found unpleasant. It was a similar experience the next day apart from it was worse with people with children running all around the place. This ruined our stay and for that reason we would be unlikely to stay again.

We had drinks one night at the bar, which was good service and a good wine list.",3,2015,02,21
40,"Great hotel, staff and location!","We stayed at this hotel based on a family referral, thank you Sally! Modern rooms but comfy vs. minimalistic. Fabulous concierge especially Elizabeth, who helped us with everything for 3 days! Trust her for great referrals including restaurants. Perfect walking location.",5,2015,02,15
40,Fantastic Hotel,"Very large rooms and bathrooms.  First class customer service! The room comes with the mini bar stocked, and the hotel also provided electricity converters.  The location is great as well.  Nice outside area to have drinks, and enjoy the night.",5,2015,02,10
40,Boutique Hotel excellence,"What a fantastic property! We are well traveled couple, travelers not tourists so boutique properties appeal to us vs a chain type of facilities.This is our second visit to BCN both times staying in this same area.    I research like crazy for every trip and rely heavy on TA reviews to sway my final decisions, great choice! Location, smack dab in the middle of high end area which is central to walk to every single thing we did from sight seeing to dining and shopping. Gabriela and staff are awesome, knowledgeable, helpful and greet you for check in with nice glass of Cava. Hotel design is modern, chic but with a twist of welcoming warmth. Finger print replaces room key, very batman like, hubby thought cool touch. lobby bar, great drinks and nice place to gather or just hang out to look at the pretty courtyard garden,weather was little chilly when there so we did not sit out there but did enjoy the view. Spring for the Alma suite if you can, worth every single nickel, large balcony patio with table and lounging chairs which we did use everyday even in the chilly weather the sun was out and the view was great to have a glass of wine and take a rest after sightseeing. Separate bedroom with paneled walls chic decor, very comfy bed, only weird thing is 2 separate down comforters (twins) makes spooning a little challenging but not a bid deal.  Massive bathroom with fantastic tub, huge rain shower with exceptional water pressure, Bvalgari products, bidet and the whole deal, luxury you would expect at a 5 star you get. closet was huge and greatly appreciated since we had a 9 night stay, love being able to unpack and be organized even on vacation. room is silent and electronic dark shades making it awesome sleeping experience. 2 bathrooms are nice to have.  love that the lobby bar will bring up drinks to the room when we did have our friends visit. Only ordered breakfast once to the room, was very good, just got a jag of coffee and large OJ every morning thereafter for 11 euros which was fine by me.  a nice touch would be for them to add a nesspresso machine to the room. Gratis mini bar is unique nice touch and for us very appreciated, waters, beer, juices and sodas replenished daily.  do wish the living room had a small sofa vs. 2 leather chairs for that late night reading hubby does found him sleeping upright few times and had to get a massage to get crick out of his neck but maybe that is the hotel plan for the spa :)    having a MAC computer in the room is incredible and we did use it few times to research sightseeing. 2 big TV's in the room, we are not tv people so can't really say much about it but did see 3-D glasses so those that like that sort of thing may enjoy it. Last time we stayed at the Majestic, more expensive and ALMA blows it away. You will not find a better location, beautifully decorated, nicely appointed, friendly staff (minus one guy that had no personality at all, he knows who he is) everyone could not have been nicer and went to the edge of the earth to make our stay perfect at any hour anteing we needed.  I was skeptical thinning what could be wrong with this hotel when I looked at the rates, we have stayed in many luxury properties and have to say globally this really was the best all around!  great job ALMA, thanks for making our trip back to Barcelona a memorable one.  reviewing hotels for a visit?   don't even think about it, ALMA is it!   cheers",5,2015,02,07
40,Great city trip,"We enjoyed two nights at the ALMA Barcelona. We tested the Bar as well as the Restaurant, all drinks and dishes were great, service very kind. Reception staff was very knowledgeble and organized tickets for a soccer game. 

Room was spacious and quiet, great shower, loved it. Will return to this great hotel.",5,2015,02,03
40,hidden gem in an amazing location,"from the minute you walk in the front door, you are in luxury. the reception team are super knowledgable and nothing is a problem for them. location is fantastic. rooms are well designed with great comfortable chairs and good shower products.  if you get a chance, book a massage - i had an amazing therapist. fitness room is basic and small, but the equipment is very good (pilates reformer and TRX included); but best of all is a beautiful lap pool.",5,2015,02,01
40,great spot,"you can't beat the location. hotel is very nice and Gabriella is a tremendous asset to the hotel. extremely helpful. stayed there for 7 nights. would stay there again in a heartbeat! rooms do need a little more lighting, but that is my only negative.",5,2015,01,29
40,Great Service,"Great welcome with very friendly and helpful staff.
Rooms beautifully finished.
Hotel understated and not brightly lit.
Probably better for couples or business than large groups but would love to go back",5,2015,01,21
40,Love this hotel,"I just stayed six nights with friends at this gem.  The hotel is in a great location, with well designed,  quiet rooms, comfortable bedding, excellent food.  The best part is the staff who are welcoming at every moment, incredibly knowledgeable, genuinely friendly and very helpful.  Their staffing process meant that front desk personnel were on for several days in a row, so they knew us and what we had done each day and were quick to inquire about how arrangements, restaurant recommendations and reservations had worked out, and always walked us out front to secure a cab and give the taxi driver instructions for us.  Truly this is the best service I have had at any hotel, and I have traveled a lot.",5,2015,01,21
40,"Perfection and Serenity offered by talented, conscientious staff.","5 star everything at a reasonable cost. Lovely, quiet, clean space offers a quiet retreat from the busy streets. Vastly knowledgeable and conscientious staff assist at every moment, with completely reliable and thoughtful advice. An absolutely delightful place to stay!",5,2015,01,20
40,Fabulous,"A beautifully designed and tranquil hotel and very well located.  The hotel benefits from a quiet and calming courtyard as well as a roof top bar with excellent views.  It is an oasis of tranquility in a vibrant city.  The decor is stylish, solid, modern, and manages to create a strong sense of home.  The staff were enormously helpful and engaging.  This is the best place we've ever stayed in Barcelona (and have tried many).",5,2015,01,15
40,"Amazing hotel, perfect in every way!","I stayed at the Alma hotel for three nights with my family. The trip to Barcelona was for my mums 70th birthday which I arranged as a surprise. I had been in contact with the hotel since last September and they were so helpful in assisting to me to arrange everything to make the stay perfect for my mum. The hotel is perfect and has such a wonderful atmosphere. The staff are so attentive and the attention to detail makes you feel so special. 

I stayed in higher grand delux room and my parents had an executive suite. Both rooms are of an exceptional standard, everything from the bedding to the toiletries is so luxurious. I had three of the best nights sleep I've had in  a long time.

The location is excellent, a short walk from the shops including Chanel and Louis Vuitton! The staff helped us arrange two different trip and booked our tickets, we was also helped to get taxis to different locations. 

The Alma was such an important part of the weekend and making my mums birthday so special. The hotel organised beautiful balloons and flowers for me and provided cava and chocolates. They also helped me orchestrate the actual 'surprise'. I am so happy and grateful to everyone at the Alma. 

The breakfast is also beautiful, everything is so wonderfully presented and so much choice. 

Cannot recommend highly enough. I will never forget it!",5,2015,01,14
40,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for about 8 nights.  Maybe the best hotel I've ever stayed in.  Excellent and helpful staff (with anything), the location is great (right off the main drag), rooms are clean, the bed exceptionally comfortable, the restaurant and bar are very good and comfortable.  Really, I can't say enough about this place.   The contemporary / modern look and feel of this place is superb.  We stayed in an inside room, thus facing the courtyard, and really liked it.  No outside noise, nice view.  Though seemingly insignificant, the comforters on the beds were A+++++.  Love the fact that they provide you water and juice, along with organic (or near organic) and cruelty free toiletries.  On that note, the showers there are great.

Thanks Alma!",5,2015,01,11
40,Nice Hotel,"We stayed here three nights prior our cruise. We loved the hotel. Convenient location, very close to good restaurants, museums, tapas bars, and shops. Service was absolutely incredible. Large room and very comfortable bed.",5,2015,01,11
40,"Six star service, Wonderful Hotel!","Fabulous hotel, stayed here over the Christmas Holiday.  First class on all levels:  large comfortable modern spotless rooms, luxurious baths, wonderful food at the restaurant, and some of the best service we have ever experienced at a Hotel.  We cannot say enough about the wonderful multi-lingual staff who went out of their way to answer every request (directions, recommendations, taxis, postal stamps, the list goes on and on) with an efficiency and helpful smiles. Breakfast was delicious with a wonderful assortment from both the buffet (fruits, wonderful cheeses and meats) and an excellent menu was offered as well.  Also had a lovely late lunch, both the food and the service (again) was outstanding.  It was out first trip to Barcelona and we all would love to return, and certainly would stay again at the Alma. Thank you for your hospitality!",5,2015,01,09
40,Amazing,"What a fantastic hotel , the service is some of the best we have ever received. We stayed here for 3 nights January 2015 and would definitely use this hotel if we come back to Barcelona again as the location is also perfect.",5,2015,01,09
40,New Year in Barcelona - Alma was a superb base,"Excellent hotel, friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever come across. Cava at check-in was a great touch. Interior is dimly lit but stylish, rooms are large and inviting. Lots of little touches made this memorable e.g. Barcelona map provided by the hotel was better than the one with our guidebook. Only slightly disappointing element was the gym, large studio but only very limited kit. One floor mat in the entire room.",5,2015,01,08
40,Perfection,"this was our second visit to this hotel. The location is superb (just off Passeig de Gracia). The welcome is superb. The hotel is smart, modern comfortable, peaceful. The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in, including their beautiful bedding.  We had a bath and a separate shower. The bath was very comfortable. All the staff in the hotel are just perfect - professional but friendly - a perfect balance. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel",5,2015,01,05
40,Amazing Hotel!!!!,Wow - I've stayed in some wonderful Hotels but this one is at the top of my list.  I stayed here for 2 nights and the wonderful staff just cannot do enough for you.   From the glass of Cava on arrival to them helping with Taxis and getting you to the best restaurants.  The rooms are wonderful and have everything that you require.  The bed was extremely comfortable and as soon as you close the door at the end of the day you know your in for a good nights sleep.  i loved the fact that they had slide shutters and not curtains so your bedroom was in total darkness and great soundproofing! We were overlooking the courtyard so every morning before breakfast it was nice to open the doors to the classical music coming from the breakfast area downstairs.  We had Breakfast in the hotel every morning and i would definatley recommend.  I will be coming to Barcelona again later on in the year and yes i will be booking the Alma again.  I just wish all Hotels could be like this - Thank you Alma you made my stay in Barcelona thoroughly enjoyable!,5,2015,01,05
40,"Stylish, comfortable, very good service","The ambiance in the hotel is interesting: ultra-modern design, muted dark and warm colors, elegant garden.  Our room was spacious, with paneled walls and an appealing and comfortable large bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable and the (down?) blankets were light and warm.  the staff were very attentive, service was responsive and excellent.  It's a pricey hotel, but its location and quality justify the expense.

Extra notable touches: free wifi (which is unusual for high priced hotels, who tend to fleece their customers), free minibar (fruit juice, water, soda, beer).",5,2015,01,04
40,Paragon of Design and Service,"How ‘bout this for understated elegance.  The ALMA’s sign measures about 4” by 6” and sits on a small pole next to a sidewalk planter.  No doorman.  No taxi line.  Just a handsome glass front looking into a bi-level spacious lobby, exquisite sculpture, cinematic lighting and an open, verdant and private plaza just beyond to enjoy fabulous cocktails and snacks.  

Approach the door, and a grey-suited man suddenly appears with a smile and welcomes you to the ALMA.  His smile and cordial greeting captures perfectly the spirit of the ALMA:  gracious personal service rarely matched in larger, more impersonal [and more famous] hotels.  One example:  when I enquired at the desk about a business center, a staff member immediately offered to bring a laptop to my room and set it up.  

Rooms are spacious, bathrooms exquisite.  Bedding is plush with comfortable mattresses [perhaps a bit too soft for me]. We’d recommend fourth floor garden view rooms for the perfect respite from Barcelona’s bustle.  Walking distance to all the major sites and museums save Parc Guel but taxis are relatively inexpensive, easy to hail and honestly efficient.",5,2015,01,03
40,An outstanding surprise!,"For my trip to Barcelona, my companion booked the hotel. I had no idea where we were staying. So we get out of the subway and walk a couple blocks in a gorgeous neighborhood full of restaurants and shopping, which has me excited. And then we approach the door which proudly declares 5 stars, and I am told we have arrived. My heart skipped a beat. I am used to nice hotels, but this one was quite impressive for me! The staff had to be the most courteous staff of any hotel I have stayed in, whether it be in the US or in Europe. Everything from the drinks we got while checking in, to the occasional question for the concierge, were handled with an eagerness to help that I am simply not accustomed to.  I cannot overstate how much of a difference the customer service made for me. The property is, of course, immaculate. The outdoor patio in the back would have been enough for my short trip, and it was tough to leave the grounds. The room was very clean. The breakfast, which you must pay for, was great. The cold cuts very fresh, fresh cheeses, fruits, and the usual breakfast fare. I have no idea if they have parking at the hotel as I used the subway. The pool and gym area was very clean. The location was fantastic, and the staff will help you find whatever it is you're looking for, and they will organize the whole trip if you desire. Oh, and you open the door with your fingerprit (you can opt out, but why?). I think the only improvement I would make would be to add a coffee maker/nespresso to the room.",5,2015,01,03
40,Sensational hotel for visit to Barca,"Our family agreed that this was the nicest hotel we have stay in in Europe.  That sounds like a strong statement, I know, but let me tell you why:  The hotel is all about making your stay in Barca relaxing and invigorating.  The hotel staff is the most helpful we have come across in our travels.
Greeting you with water or Cava upon your arrival was lovely. Using finger-printing for room and spa entry so you don't have to worry about keys was great for our family of 4. Very comfortable rooms (the Egyptian cotton sheets were amazing and pillow were soft and supportive) made us so happy to return home after late-night dining. Panels on windows create black-out for great sleeping. The small, but very well-deisned spa was a refreshment before tapas/dinner. The stocked (free mini-bar) is a generous gesture...Wonderful bar and bartender downstairs.  Everyone there is trained to not impose, but be extremely helpful for all aspects of hospitality.
Everything was tasteful, modern, clean, elegantly casual.  One suggestion I'd have is to offer early moring coffee/tea downstairs in the gorgeous lobby/dining area.",5,2015,01,02
40,"İnteresting Design, Superb Quality","Alma hotel is the most interesting hotel, i have ever seen also its very beautiful. Restaurant in the hotel is surprisingly good. Rooms are big and Comfortable. Staff was very kind. WiFi is fast and free. ",5,2014,12,30
40,perfect christmas stay.,"We stayed in between christmas & new year & once again we had a fabulous stay. The checkin staff are very welcoming & we were offered a seat & drink upon arrival which was very welcomed after an early morning flight. The hotel decor is very comtempory, very relaxing with fabulous helpful staff.  We particularly love the garden, which is beautiful.   We chose an executive suite this was beautiful, very spacious & very clean with a huge bathroom, modern decor, free mini bar & comfy beds although we did find the pillows a little uncomfortable. The spa had steam room, gym & pool which was very relaxing after a long day sight seeing. The hotel is in a perfect location close to shops & restaurants. Looking forward to staying again",5,2014,12,30
40,Surprisingly one of the best hotels I've ever seen,"Was impressed by photos and booked a room. The first thing which surprised me was fingerprinting which was further used as a key to the room (works fine). I'm a bit paranoid by fingerprinting idea, however, I have to acknowledge that it is very convenient. Design is very interesting. Rooms are spacious. Inner yard is very nice. One strange thing - no door separating bath/shower area from the room. Anyway, everything was fine. I had a great time in the city and returned back late evening and decided to have a dinner. Food was superb, very nice fish (as far as I remember it was monkfish), nice tea (Tila Nights) - overall nice restaurant in the inner yard. As a summary - it is one of the best hotels I've ever seen/stayed (and I stayed in many upscale ones). I really enjoyed it. Definitely worth considering if you plan a trip to Barcelona",5,2014,12,24
40,Winter and Barcelona,"It's always easy to nit-pick, so I'll start that way.  I didn't like the pillows and disjunct comforter in a two-person bed.  So if you're staying as a couple at the Alma, ask for firmer pillows and a single comforter.

...That said, you should absolutely stay at the Alma because it's a fabulous hotel.

Huck and I travelled to Barcelona on a crisp December weekend.  (...That said, you should absolutely travel to Barcelona on a crisp December weekend.)  We chose the Alma by way of the ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" service.  Our criterion was a location within strolling distance of the city centre, where by ""strolling"" I mean the sort of arm-linked shuffling along cafés and landmarks one won't engage, but merely observe.

What about the Alma comes first to mind?  I say, ""shower, spa"".  Huck says, ""the service"", then adds, ""it's handsomely furnished"".  She then pauses and amends, ""masculinely furnished"".

Huck has an eye for these things, so let's start there.  Indeed, the front-desk folks took the time to make sure we were comfortable in every way, from the car to finding restaurants.  I can only add that the front-desk lobby itself is a reflection of the Alma: quiet and intimate, bucking the trend of the vast, impersonal lobbies of large hotels.  We dined only once at the hotel, and briefly at that, so I've little to say about the experienced besides that the F&B staff were courteous, helpful, and friendly.

As for the rooms, I agree with ""handsome"", even if I can't really elaborate on the masculinity of furnishing.  The room was laid out with only the essentials (perhaps this is ""masculine""?), and yes, each essential was comfortable and tastefully styled.  Some might say overly austere, I suppose, if inclined toward, well, ""feminine"" furnishings. (?)  Either way, the marbled bathroom floors, enormous shower area, and comfortable bed needed little more to make a perfect stay.

Anyway, I focussed more on the tangibles.  The showers, which any couple will tacitly agree emblematises a hotel's spirit of romance.  The Alma has tremendous overhead rainmakers.  And not just in the room, but in the spa as well.  The room shower seemed to take up the lion's share of the bathroom, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Our room had a bath as well, but we we didn't use it.

While staying at the Alma, do use the spa.  Better yet, wake early and book an evening couples massage.  Take advantage of one of the local gyms before lunch.  (Technogym--sorry, gym rats, it's a plastic all the way through--though clean and spacious at least.)  Sight-see all day. Then spend an hour or two after your massage soaking in the spa.  Agree to go out afterward for drinks or tapas, but don't.

It's not a large spa, and with another guest or two in residence, it'd probably be a little tight.  But after a day meandering in the Spanish winter air, it has all things in the right proportions.  Wait til the two of you are alone.  Swim the backstroke in the ""pool"" and admire yourself in the ceiling window reflection.  (Don't actually swim, as you'll be disappointed by the pool's dimensions.)  Decide to use the steam room, then move to the sauna.  Fiddle with the many and sundry gauges and levers in the central showers.  In retrospect, it was missing a whirlpool, which I favour for my creaky limbs.

On that note, temper your expectations of a vigorous deep-tissue massage.  Think ""relaxing"".  For me, this usually equates to ""think sleepy""; and indeed, I think I drifted off.  But despite my knots remaining knotted, I felt remarkably refreshed.  Perfect for emerging into a spa for an indolent sort of swim.  Again, don't show off your butterfly stroke to your partner: it's not the time or place.

Let's end this by returning to my nit-pick.  Hotel Alma, why split a two-person bed?  Every couple has a secret checklist in their minds when they enter a hotel room.  Drowsy lighting, maybe.  A marbled bath.  Certainly, a single bed--not two beds jammed together (effecting the dreaded bed-crack).  For some reason, while not having a ""bed-crack"", the Alma still used two separate comforters instead of just one.  It's not like it was uncomfortable (the pillows, however, were decidedly uncomfortable, compressing into infinite points by morning), just a little un-romantic.  Nit-pick over!

Enjoy your stay at the Alma!

40,Exceptional!,"We stayed recently with close friends celebrating a birthday for the weekend.We booked the executive room which was very spacious and comfortable, bed was one of the best I had slept in!
With all the great things you could say about this hotel nothing comes close to the the exceptional way you are treated from the first moment you check in until you leave by all the staff in this hotel! WOW! Customer service at its best, nothing is to much trouble and you do feel special throughout your stay! We'll done and this is how hotels should be! Do not look past this worth every penny and a ideal location for your trip to Barcelona.Will be back and will not hesitate to recommend.",5,2014,12,02
40,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic service","We travelled to Barcelona to celebrate my partners 40th birthday. Not having been before we weren't sure which area to stay in but Alma Hotel was perfect. Despite the wet weather we walked to many of the key attractions always making use of the complimentary umbrellas. The room was lovely, maybe lacking a bit of lighting but certainly very comfortable and it provided a luxurious feel. We had a junior suite, which was very spacious; the bathroom was fabulous and also a good size. Given the bad weather we also made time to try the spa, which was also lovely. I think what made the stay most enjoyable was the high level of service right from the moment we checked in. The standout member of staff was the barman, Manolo (sp?) Who not only recommended a couple of lovely restaurants but also called to make sure we could get a reservation. He also checked opening times of some attractions and although we don't smoke, we did see him fetch a couple of umbrellas so some guests could stand outside in the pouring rain. I would definitely return to Alma Barcelona and also reccomed it to friends.",5,2014,12,01
40,Excellence at it's best!!!,"The Alma Experience from start to finish was of highest possible professionalism, courtesy and willingness to help from everyone at the hotel. 

We booked two executive suites for the week end and we could have not have not asked for anything better.  This hotel provided everything we expected and impressed us with the friendliness we received throughout our stay.

We like our holidays and very selective with what we choose.  We would recommend this hotel without hesitation and will definitely return one day.",5,2014,12,01
40,"Best location, classy, and beautiful","I am a hotel snob. There, I've said it. That being said, you should know that I do a ton of research before booking a hotel. I feel as if a hotel should be as nice, or nicer, than my own home.

The Alma Hotel is my first choice hotel in Barcelona. During my visit, I noted other hotels that I had considered (W, Ritz, Mercer). I was satisfied that I had chosen perfectly.

The Alma is located in a central, and very upscale, neighborhood. (The W was way down by The Harbor, which is desolate at night). We were able to walk to every sight without any difficulty.

The rooms are well appointed (although I met guest who was disappointed that there was no iron in the room; they promptly went out and BOUGHT him one!). It is CLEAN, and QUIET. The staff is knowledgeable, and friendly. I did not feel smothered, or ignored, by the staff. They were readily available to eagerly make restaurant suggestions (all good, and NOT touristy) and reservations. They seemed to remember us, when we passed them in the lobby, and asked us follow up questions to previous requests that we had. I never felt that we were constantly being ""monitored"" by them.

The Alma is a small hotel, with BIG advantages. I would recommend this hotel to any finicky, upscale, traveler.",5,2014,11,29
40,First time in Barcelona great hotel choice,"This hotel is in a great location between two subway stations and walking distance to many Gaudi sites. The junior suite was lovely with a gorgeous roomy bathroom. We can't say enough about how fabulous the staff is, from the front desk to the bar/restaurant they are top shelf. Having a glass of cava on check-in really set the tone. 
Unfortunately we didn't take time to visit the spa.
But did we did enjoy the complimentary water, beer, juice and soda in the mini-bar it's a nice feature.
Breakfast is priced very high at 25€  per person so we only had it once. Dinner menu is priced fairly and was delicious.
We stayed three nights and highly recommend this hotel. If The Four Seasons is the 5 star benchmark I would put the Alma at 4.5.",5,2014,11,28
40,Best service we had in Europe.,We stayed at the Alma based on the Trip Advisors reviews. We were not disappointed the service was great and the staff was was very helpful. We can't wait to stay at the Alma when we return to Barcelona.,5,2014,11,24
40,Great service in an excellent location,"First of all, this is a hotel that anyone should stay at when visiting Barcelona.

I will start from the customer service: it Is superb, above the average of a great customer service. When the taxi stops at the door of the hotel, the bellman immediately open the trunk and take out all the  luggages and takes you to the check in area. The check in is really fast and KIND, they invite you to drink anything you may ask for. I asked for a tea and the check in was that fast that I didn't even try the tea, so they send me a new one to my room. 

One of the best things of the hotel is that you don't have to carry with keys nor cards, you enter your room with your fingers, that's it.

The room is really generous, comfortable, clean, quite, surrounded by an amazing design and furnitures. The bathroom is VERY NICE, modern. The only thing that I will change is that the shower is open, there is no doors at the entrance of the bathroom nor in the shower. So, if you want to have a hot shower you can't.

The bed is very comfortable as well as the pillows. The towels and slippers are excellent!

The breakfast is just the best you can have (you can order unlimited eggs, juices, cheeses, ham, breads, etc) and is just 25 euros. One of the things that I consider very good of the hotel is that the prices of the rooms, restaurant are very affordable and invites to stay at the hotel to take a drink or snack. In other hotel, you don;t want to spend lots of euros for just a beer and cheese, this is not the case.

The hotel has a terrace that is the most enjoying part of the hotel, amazing.

Two more important things:

1- The SPA is GREAT and most important: It's free. Last May I stayed at the W hotel and they outsource the spa and you have to pay a lot.

2- They offer FRE WI FI and for an unlimited number of devices.

And the thing that I want to highlight the most is the customer service, the best you can have in a hotel far from home. The location can't be better, 20 mts from the Paseo de Gracia Avenue.",5,2014,11,24
40,"GREAT HOTEL, WONDERFUL SERVICES. GREAT LOCATION","Alma Barcelona is a wonderful hotel in a central location within walking distance of many attractions, restaurants, cafes and shopping. Kudos to the front desk staff who were very helpful and friendly. We were warmly welcomed with a drink, local map, and concierge services. Our room
was very comfy, modern, spacious, quiet. Would certainly stay there again.",5,2014,11,23
40,One of the best hotels in Barcelona!,"The Alma hotel continues to stand as my benchmark for boutique hotels, it is situated in an ideal location, a short distance from Passeige de Gracia. Where the views combine the city’s most elegant and hauntingly beautiful architecture.
 
The accommodation is sumptuously lavish while maintaining a minimalist organisation of furniture and modern features, offering all of the services you can come to expect from a five star hotel. The staff provide an outstanding service, from the Cava reception on check in, advice and guidance on exploring the city, to the bar service. There was a constant precision and personal nature to the service.
 
I dined at the hotel restaurant and was very impressed with the presentation, flavour and variety available. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious break in the centre of Barcelona.",5,2014,11,18
40,Very comfy,"Loved it. I was tired towards the end our vacation, so I really loved the comfortable room and really comfortable bed. Very centrally located - walk to a lot of the sites and close to metro. Very nice shower. Rooms are quite contemporary and spacious. The staff is helpful, friendly and speak english very well. All in all a very pleasant stay indeed.",5,2014,11,18
40,ALMA -5 Star through & through - though normal prices!!!!,"Bang in the heart of Barcelona - very easy access to designer shops as well as 'Normal' shops!!
In fact walking distance to all major attractions - On check in, the hotel reception supplied a free 'walk about' map of the city, which was a very welcoming gesture. Getting around was easy.
The staff all spoke very good english (as well as other languages) and everybody went out of their way to make our short stay extremely pleasant & comfortable. 
Even though your in the heart of the city - the rooms were very quiet. WiFi was excellent & the TV system had a choice of English, German & French channels…. as well as Spanish of course. The food was excellent - not just in the hotel, but in the whole city - lots of restaurants, cafes, bars etc - even McDonalds were close by. The swimming pool is not the biggest, but very comfortable & the spar facility was very clean. The designer bits n bobs in the bathrooms were first class & the room fridge was stocked daily - Free!!!! - To balance these comments I normally add any negative aspects… the only thing I can think of is bring your own travel iron, however to be really fair …. Ironing services are available by housekeeping - so really not necessary….All said I would not hesitate to thoroughly recommend this top class Hotel.",5,2014,11,16
40,Wonderful hotel,"Great location! Easy walking distance to upscale shops in Barcelona.
The staff is warm, friendly and focused on customer service. They go out of their way to assist you with dinner reservations, places of interest and things to do. The hotel is contemporary in design with an awesome vibe! The rooms are spacious and  immaculate. A wonderful hotel!!",5,2014,11,15
40,Luxury at a price,"Certainly the welcome, attention to detail and friendliness of the staff could not be better. The room at the back overlooked a pleasant square of courtyards and the room was quiet and peaceful. The facilities in the room were good but free coffee or tea either to make in the room or downstairs in the lovely sitting area would have been a welcome addition after a day browsing the city. 
The excellent city tour Bus system stops only 100 meters away from the hotel on the main exclusive shopping street. You can get your bearings of the city and its surrounds and luckily join the trip early in its route taking you around three different routes of attractions. 
The hotel restaurant menu is limited but excellent quality food as is the breakfast although a bit costly. The hotel Cava is excellent value per bottle. The reception is very willing to help to find alternative eating places. The pool is small but adequate for a relaxing end to the day as is the sauna and from my experience both very empty. ",4,2014,11,11
40,Helped make a holiday in Barcelona woderful,"We spoilt ourselves by having an executive room and it was very spacious indeed. The staff at the hotel were very helpful indeed and Nikitta could not have been more helpful when we checked in. he is a marvelous ambassador for the hotel in our opinion. The hotel is centrally situated for everything and again,the staff were very helpful in their recommendations. No charges were made for the mini bar which was a very big plus. If we have comments then, 1) put coffee and tea making machines in the rooms, 2) add cereals to the breakfast buffet. However, Definitely on the list to stay again when returning to Barcelona, Very well done !!",5,2014,11,10
40,"Excellent location, room and staff","Hotel Alma is a wonderful hotel located perfectly in Barcelona to experience the entire city - all the best neighborhoods. We came to Barcelona for 4 nights for a mini-moon from our home in NYC and were delighted by the size, cleanliness and luxury-comfort of the junior suite (ask for room 302 if you like a lighter room with views of Passeig de Gracia). The room is well appointed and generously sized; the amenities, including a free mini-bar of beer, water and juice and the spa are great perks. The staff really makes the experience at Alma. The front desk and room teams helped us graciously with a room change to a higher floor, dinner recommendations (excellent suggestions), printing various tickets, etc and yet was not overbearing or omnipresent. If you're a fan of hotels like the Mercer, the Crosby or Soho House in NYC, you'll love everything about Alma in Barcelona.",5,2014,11,09
40,Amazing hotel!,I absolutely loved this hotel! The rooms are extremely comfortable. The staff is very professional and so helpful. I really enjoyed my stay there and I will definitely be staying there again when I return to Barcelona! Just one recommendation....the rooms really need coffee machines!:),5,2014,11,05
40,The Staff truly Spoiled Me,"I stayed at the Alma with my friend October 19 through October 25, 2014....It was an awesome experience. Nikita at the front desk was very helpful. He took time out to show us how to work things in our room and he made the best recommendations for restaurants. He was available every time we needed him. On nights that I could not go to sleep because of the time difference between the United States and Europe I sat at the bar with Manolo and he gave great recommendations on light meals that the restaurant had to offer. I also do not drink alcoholic beverages he was able to find a great drink for me along with some nice hot tea to help me fall asleep. My room was very comfortable and cozy. I love the slippers and robe that was available everyday. Our mini bar was full of juices and waters everyday. I absolutely loved my experience at the Alma.....I hope to return one day in the near future.",5,2014,11,03
40,Very Nice,"I traveled with my best friend who had never been outside of the United States. The customer service at the Alma is exceptional. The front desk staff are knowledgeable and friendly. From recommendations and directions to restaurants, to tickets to local attractions, they helped us to navigate Barcelona quite effectively. The hotel is clean and very, very quiet. The style of this boutique hotel is modern and minimalist, but that doesn't mean uncomfortable at all. The beds are quite heavenly, not to mention the rain shower! A special thank you to Nikita at the front desk who went out of his way to help us and answer our questions. I always want to thank Manolo at the bar. He was both helpful and charming.",5,2014,10,31
40,what i have expected,"I am a frequent flier/traveler and I have to say this hotel was really matched to a 5 star property. everything was fantastic, food, wine, location and most importantly GREAT reception and people. the only negative I might say, the pillows were too soft (but you may like it)",5,2014,10,31
40,A great hotel for a great vacation in Barcelona,"We spent 4 nights at the Alma and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona. The hotel is centrally located, within walking distance to many of the main attractions, is one block from a tour bus stop and 2 blocks from a train stop. We took the train from the airport and walked less than 10 minutes to the hotel. The hotel is very clean and quite. The rooms are very sizable, clean and modern. We had a room overlooking the garden. They offer a free mini bar, which includes beer, water and soda, which they restock daily for free. The bathroom was large a spaceous and the bathroom was great. The shower is an wonder. The one thing that sets this hotel a part from others is the level of service provided. Service to the room is extremely quick and courteous. The front office staff is very helpful and always inquiring about what they can do to make your stay more enjoyable. They really make this a hotel that you will want to stay in and return to. As far as we were concerned, the person who helped make the trip memorable was Elizabeth C from the front office staff. She was above and beyond in her level of service and warm personality. From  her recommendations on how to get around, where to eat and things to do. It was always a pleasure and education to spend time with her before leaving and after returning to the hotel.  She was off on the day we departed and even tried to see us off before we left. Unfortunately we just missed her. Barcelona is truly a wonderful place to visit and the Alma and Elizabeth are a perfect compliment to the special experience that any city would want their visitors to have. This is truly a great hotel to stay at.",5,2014,10,30
40,exceptional hotel,"Spent 4 nights in Barcelona in October. Arrived at the hotel to warm welcome and 2 glasses of cava for the wife and I. Extremely nice and stylish hotel, great rooms and the hotel restaurant is probably one of the best places to eat in the entire city.",5,2014,10,29
40,Another Great Stay,"We stayed at the Alma Barcelona a couple of years ago and again recently.  Both times we stayed in a very spacious executive/junior suite (what it is called depends on who you use to book).  The hotel is modern minimalist.  The room includes free minibar and free wifi.  The bathroom is great with a deep soaking tub and a rain head shower.  The hotel is well located within walking distance to all the major attractions.  But best of all is the service.  Everyone is friendly and eager to make your stay the best it an be from the time you check in, everytime you walk in or out, or when you need them to store your luggage while you do some last minute sightseeing. The Alma has been a top hotel in Barcelona for a reason.",5,2014,10,27
40,First class stay at the Alma Barcelona,"Wonderful hotel, in a great location.  Our room was very comfortable and quiet, overlooking the very pleasant gardens at the rear of the Hotel.  All of the staff were helpful and friendly. The reception were happy to make reservations at restaurants, book tickets for entry to museums and generally give helpful advice on getting the best out of our stay.",5,2014,10,26
40,One of the best !!,"I was travelling with family and we had a great stay at the Alma. The staff was amazing and the location was so convienient . I have over the years stayed in lots of fabulous properties and I have to say that the service was among the best I have ever experienced.  

I would without a doubt recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona. intact my even my friends who live in Barcelona fell in love with the hotel.

My only compliant if I had one would be the lack of a iron that they could sent to the rooms if the guests need one.
 But other than that it was absolutely fab!!

A big Thank You to all the staff of the hotel  for a wonderful stay.",5,2014,10,24
40,excellent in every thing,"we are travel agency in Egypt we was had a group of 40 doctors, we stayed for a week, they really enjoy them stay very much, we didn't receive a single complain from any thing, the staff was amazing starting from the door man to the manager. and they have a professional concierge help our group very much, by the way we was had in the same period another group in a hotel very near to Alma the guest in the other hotel use to come to Alma concierge to ask about any thing they need.

really thank you so much Alma Staff and we will not hesitate to accommodate our upcoming group at your hotel",5,2014,10,20
40,Great Hotel,We have stayed in many nice hotels and this one was wonderful. It deserves five stars.  It is close to the Gaudi buildings and walking distance the the rest of the must see sites.  The staff could not have been more helpful.  I would not hesitate to recommend or stay again.,5,2014,10,20
40,Amazing representation of Barcelona,"From reservation, booking, check in and check out this hotel impressed us a LOT!
The staff was very helpful in making sure everything was convenient for a first time visitor in Barcelona.
We couldn't ask for more in terms of location. It is in the very heart of everything we wanted to see in Barcelona. Walking distance from every single important point of interest.
The room, spacious, nice simple elegant and just lovely!
Wifi worked perfectly!
Will definitely recommend this hotel and will be back!",5,2014,10,20
40,Amazing hotel!,"This hotel was such a pleasant surprise. We received top notch service from beginning to end. The location is perfect near all the shopping and an easy walk to other attractions like La Pedrera and Sagrada Familia. 

The room was the best part. It was very modern and clean. The bedding was fresh and clean everyday with a really soft down comforter for each of us. The room was always cleaned very nicely each day. The shower was a huge walkin with a rain shower head. The best part was the free minibar! What hotel ever does that. It was restocked without fail each day.

 The spa pool area was just as the pictures promised. A great pool area very uniquely designed with a steam and sauna room. The gym wasn't amazing but enough to get by.

The breakfast area was nice but the price was a bit much. There are many choices for meals nearby so that was no problem. The outdoor lounge area was very nice and we often ended our days outside with a drink in the garden area. This place is definitely a place I would seek out again if I was to visit this great city again. Amazing hotel in a very special city.",5,2014,10,19
40,Love love love this hotel,"Stayed here for 3 days 3 nights and loved this hotel. The beds were comfy, the garden of tranquility (nicknamed by my husband and I) and the breakfast were all amazing but the thing that made it amazing were the staff. Manolo at the bar - our dark and stormy mixologist - and a few of the reception staff need special mention (I think Javi and the blond girl) went out of their way to recommend places to eat, walking routes and things to do! Including trying to get our money back from a missed visit to the Sagrada Familia. They anticipated everything from a massage (which was excellent) to a late check out. Will be back!!! 

The only suggestion would be to make the pool slightly deeper ;) and to clean it more often! 
",5,2014,10,19
40,Alma Hotel Barcelona,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Alma Hotel. We were there for 2 nights. We were met at the door by Marcos who was really friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Check in was a really pleasant experience with refreshments being offered. My fingerprint was used to open the door to our room so no fear of losing the room key!! Loved the location of this hotel--so close to everything. The hop on, hop off bus is just around the corner and the Sagrada Familia  a short 15 min walk away. We found a lovely little cafe a short 5 min walk away called Ramplax and there is also a fabulous tapas bar about 2 min walk away. The hotel has a beautiful courtyard where you can relax with a drink or have a meal.",5,2014,10,17
40,Luxurious,Our stay at The Alma was a wonderful experience. From the moment you check in (where you are offered refreshments) to the moment you check out. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Breakfast was a relaxing start to the day with plenty of options. All the staff were very friendly and helpful from arranging taxis to their knowledge of all aspects of sightseeing. We will definitely stay again.,5,2014,10,14
40,Great hotel,"We spent 5 nights at the Alma on our first trip to Barcelona and loved this hotel.  The location is convenient to the metro, shopping and many good restaurants and cafes.  I can't say enough about the staff, very friendly and eager to be helpful.  The decor is contemporary, even spare but comfortable -- great mattress if you prefer firm over soft.  The breakfast buffet is the best I've ever had in a hotel -- great local cheeses, ham, small sandwiches with salmon or ham, fruit, yogurt, breads, delicious churros and pastries. We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the garden which was completely quiet, even with a large private function in the garden below.  I used the fitness center which is limited to one bike, one treadmill, some free weights and TRX apparatus plus a Pilates macihine -- would have liked an elliptical.  A great place, would happily recommend or go back.",5,2014,10,13
40,Modern luxury in Barcelona,"Service-helpful without being unctuous.  After an overnight flight from NY, were greeted by a gracious doorman and concierge.  The concierge offered us coffee or champagne or water (we picked the excellent espresso) and sat us down and allowed us to check in early.  We stayed in a Gran Deluxe room which was extremely clean, quiet and overlooked the leafy back terrace/garden.  Loved the Malin+Goetz toiletries as well as the complimentary fridge filled with bottled water, diet Coke and beer.  For shyer travelers, keep in mind that the shower has a clear glass wall that looks into the sink area (but there's a screen separating this from the bed & there's a separate room for the actual toilet).  Bed was very comfortable.  Gym had a treadmill and stationery bike (would have liked an elliptical but this is a minor issue) and lap pool.  Buffet breakfast was plentiful/delicious (ranges of warm egg entrees/salamis/pastries) and pricey (to be expected in a hotel of this caliber).  Would have liked a little more lighting in the bedroom.
Literally a half block away from shops like Chanel/Hermes/LV etc as well as some of the more well-known Gaudi buildings/museums. Am hoping to return to Barcelona in the near future and would book this place in a heartbeat.  
 Ps-if you're looking for a much less expensive but delish breakfast, two blocks away is a Baluard bakery with freshly baked and artisanal breads/pastries",5,2014,10,12
40,I’d return there with no doubts.,"I spent a lovely time in Alma during my last stay in Barcelona.
The location is perfect, close to everything at a walk distance even if the taxi services in Barcelona is so easy to be accessed.
Alma is a 5* gl hotel, so you expect a bespoke management but I want to mention the warm attention provided by all the staff.
Our executive suite was large and comfortable enough to meet the needs, even the minibar it has been below any reasonable expectation for the level of the hotel.
Great and SPA, where I benefit of a massage, steam bath and hot bath after the long lovely walk downtown.
If I need to identify an area of improvement, the Restaurant and Room Service menu is too ordinary without any option that tented me to stay relaxed in the hotel.
Overall is a 5, and I’d return there with no doubts.",5,2014,10,10
40,Fantastic but ridiculously expensive,"The design (more danish than catalan), the building (art-deco), the rooms, the linens, the breakfasts, the garden, the dinner (oh god, goat leg, and choice of wines), the sauna, the quality of sleep, — everything is wonderful. Except of a) price, b) slow service in restaurant). High reco to anyone in BCN.",5,2014,10,09
40,Wonderful,"delightful hotel, great location and facilities, staff absolutely wonderful, engaging, friendly, helpful. Breakfast probably a bit overpriced for the food provided but really a minor negative when set against everything else. Would definitely stay here again if coming back to Barcelona.",5,2014,10,09
40,Beautiful Hotel,"We loved staying at the Alma. The location was excellent and the whole ambience is really lovely, understated and elegant. The staff are excellent and could not have been any better in every way.
My only comment is it is very quiet and there is something nice about walking into a hotel and seeing other people around. It is a very private place.A little too quiet at dinner time, so a feeling of there not being anyone else around. This is of course very nice after the crowds in the streets.
I chose this hotel over another because it had a pool but my only real complaint is that the pool is not really good to swim in as it is too shallow. A pity as the pool looks beautiful but no good for  real swimming exercise.",5,2014,10,08
40,A Five Star Review with an Asterisk *,"My second stay at this Alma, this time for a week.  First the excellent points:
-The location is fantastic walking or underground to everything
-The staff is outstanding and amazingly helpful
-Breakfast is too much food and too expensive but dinner is excellent and ""fairly priced"" (including the wine) for Barcelona.  We ate dinner twice once after being caught in a down pour and had no desire to go back out and once for a late night dinner after a very busy day.  Both meals were in a restaurant that you would go if it were not in the hotel.
-The rooms and decor are fantastic and comfortable
The views from the inside court yard rooms of the Gaudi are amazing
The not so good:
-On our last night, a Saturday, when we had a 3:30am wake up call for an early flight to London there was a roof top party (we were on the sixth floor) going on with live music.  The thumping continued until 1:30am and resulted in a miserable night ...

I am not sure I knew there were facilities on the roof top for private parties... If I did I would rethink the acceptance of a room on the sixth floor.  My last visit was on the fifth floor and was three nights during the week so the positives were true but there was no negative on that visit.

I will come back BUT I will be very particular about which room I would accept for my stay.",5,2014,10,08
40,Fantastic ,"First time in Barcelona and Alma made it all the better. Great position, well appointed, a hidden "" mid summer night dream"" garden in the back allowed us to feel we were far from the maddening crowds.

Rooms beautiful, breakfast expensive but filling and classy. Steam room and sauna a lovely touch.

But the staff at Alma are the real outstanding aspect that has not been beaten in any of the 5 star hotels I stay in frequently. The concierges all are knowledgable , delightful , helpful, kind, and nothing is too much . Being ubiquitous but not pushy is a hard balance to achieve, but Xavier and his team manage superbly . Well done alma - we will be back",5,2014,10,06
40,Recommended,"Stayed here for 4 nights with family. Was recommended by a family friend. Great hotel for shopping - near luxury brands and some Gaudi sites. Also easily accessible to La Ramblas - can either take taxi or walk around 15mins. Definitely recommend this hotel. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable  staff, good location, clean and modern. Wifi connection was great as well!",5,2014,10,05
40,"Great hotel, amazing service",This is a terrific find in Barcelona....the hotel staff is totally focused on customer service....the room was beautifully appointed and the bathroom  design was one of the best in Europe. Only suggestion is to upgrade the lighting in the rooms for those of us who have problem eyesight.,5,2014,10,05
40,Pricey but still good,"This is the second time we stayed here. I brought my family of six. The service and the coincerge are really good and the room are in top conditions. It has the best location and come with a price. The breakfast is good but expensive (25 EUROS). Service was a bit slow this time around (they becomes well known with full house). Compared to MO and Majestic, it is still affordable. There are some cheaper alternatives around like RPG but can't beat the service. Do get a drink on the top floor - well worth it",5,2014,10,01
40,Oozes class and style with top notch service ,"Stayed here for 1 night on our anniversary getaway. Perfect hotel for shopping since it is located in a side street of the passeig de Gracia, Barcelona's 5th avenue. Upon check in we received a nice glass of cava and it took 5 minutes including the fingerprint recognition as key. Cool and no hassle with keys or cards... We stayed in room 416, an executive suite. The room, as well as the entire look of the hotel and its grounds, oozes reserved and minimalist class. High ceilings, great in size. A home away from home. Best slippers I ever had... Color schemes, lighting, every detail was perfect. After a quick swim (shallow pool -90cm) and sauna we returned to the room to find a bottle of cava and a delicious berries/melon/apple fruitsalad. When we checked out, Gabriella and Saray helped me to check in early at the ritzcarlton Arts hotel and made sure we had everything we needed. Staff was attentive but not invasive. Available and in the background. Even tough I haven't tried any other hotel nearby the Ramblas, I'd be surprised if any other would equal the Alma. And I'm happy to have skipped the mandarin oriental.
I will return. Enough said.",5,2014,09,30
40,If you want only the best,"Having stayed at Casa Fuster a week before, I wanted to experience other hotels.  I was delighted from when I first walked into the building.  Greated by a cold glass of Cava, I was quickly and graciously welcomed.  Walking up a few steps you are greeted with a six story open hall adjacent to a dining/bar area. One of my favorite features was the finger print recognition for room entry.  There is no need to worry about those silly access cards.  The room, a Jr suite, was perfectly decorated.  I will use the blue that it was painted in my home.  The rooftop terrace was amazing.  To the east, the spires of Sagrada Familia were readily visible, as well as, many of the other iconic buildings of Barcelona.  The terrace was also made more enjoyable by the smiling face of Manolo, the main bartender.  He was always willing to meet any requests.  If management reads this, he deserves a raise.  In addition to Manolo, the other staff was also very personable, helpful, and welcoming on return from a day out.  When I travel, I want great service, but I also expect personable service.  Alma provides this in an excellent atmosphere in a superb location.",5,2014,09,25
40,Fabulous Barcelona Pit Stop,We had one night in Barcelona to connect to a flight before we headed off on our honeymoon.  The hotel is beautiful.  The staff are amazingly helpful and friendly.  The food in the restaurant is superb.  It was a perfect pit stop for us.,5,2014,09,22
40,Great Hotel,"Second visit to Alma. Very stylish. Large rooms which are kept in imaculate condition, good fitness centre with fine lap pool, top notch staff. Two outdoor bars (rooftop and rear garden) both of which are comfortable and well laid out. Air condition works perfectly. Rooms silent. All complimented by a great location.",5,2014,09,22
40,Just Perfect,"So a beautiful hotel, very modern good sized rooms very comfortable beds with lovely bed linen with the most comfortable pillows. The reception staff are very welcoming helpful and friendly nothing is any trouble to them. Breakfast is expensive but very very nice and such a wonderful choice again very nice staff. I look forward to returning.",5,2014,09,21
40,Balmy Barcelona,"Chose this hotel after reading previous reviews, and it live up to its promises. The location was superb. Just off one of the major roads in Barcelona, but not at all noisy. It was easy to access all the sights either by foot, by metro or by travelling on the open top tourist bus.
The staff were all extremely welcoming, especially Mariella on Reception. The only small gripe would be that the pool in the basement is just too shallow to swim in.....without scraping your knees!",5,2014,09,20
40,Great stay in Barcelona!,"The Alma was recommended by a friend who has stayed there previously.  It was perfect.  The price was right in consideration of the level of property and location.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  We walked to La Familia, La Rambla and many other museums. The Metro was also close by.  A relatively lower key area with lots of shopping and restaurants within walking.  I will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,09,19
40,Top of the line,"The Alma Barcelona team has the ""luxury and comfort"" formula figured out! This is a modern hotel with all the conveniences but in an old facade in the middle of the Centre district. While the hotel is impressive, the staff is even better. They will go to any length to help you with your questions and travel plans.",5,2014,09,18
40,"Perfect Location, Perfect Hotel","A little more luxury then I am used to and a little more expensive then I am used to, but well worth it, perfect hotel for visiting this magnificent city. Breakfast is great, rooms are beautiful and clean.
No complaints what so ever. would love to return sometime",5,2014,09,18
40,Simply the best,"Where should I start? Location is perfect, service is perfect, hotel is beautiful. Rooms are big and well designed. Wifi is free and works well. Breakfast is nice. Very good value for money. Can't say one bad thing. The best hotel in the city. I will be back for sure. ",5,2014,09,17
40,Modern Luxury at its Best,"Modern, sophisticated and comfortable. This hotel is everything a modern hotel should be, stunning design with 5 star service that doesn't think it's cooler than the guest (cough cough W, and Morgans). It's located in the heart of the high end shopping area of Barcelona, but can easily walk to the old part of town and many of the historical tourist attractions.  

Would recommend taking a taxi to the beach.  We stayed here after a cruise for only 1 night, and we wish we were staying longer.  The hotel staff was so gracious to let us check-in at 9:30am. There was a lovely buffet breakfast that was the perfect way to start our day it wasn't cheap, 25 Euros, but the food quality was worth it.  

There's a wonderful rooftop bar that great for taking in a drink and views of the city.

The rooms are huge for European standards which might make it ideal for families, but the bathrooms aren't very private so not for families with older kids. 

One of my favorite hotels of all time.

Design: High End Modern
Room Size: Very Large
Beds: Extremely Comfortable and Soft
Bathroom: Large Walk-in Shower semi private from the room, but private commode room.
Price: $$$$
Value for the Area: Very good, cheaper than other 5 star hotels in the area
Who's it good for: Couples or business travelers
What Makes it Stand Out: The modern feel of the hotel and room, also they use your fingerprint as the room key.",5,2014,09,16
40,Great place to stay,"Been to Barcelona a number of times and just returned after a three night stay at the Alma.  Read reviews on tripadvisor so was not alarmed at the dark areas of the reception (checked in at 7.30pm).  Glass of Cava on arrival whilst checking in and finger print recognition for the room ""key"".  Staff are very, very polite and helpful.  As we had booked for our friends birthday we asked for a garden room for our friends as previous comments had said these were the best rooms.  The garden rooms were very spacious with lots of storage space for the minimalism theme.  Our room which was not a garden room but was the same theme but with only one single wardrobe and what I can only describe as a long bench along one wall. Difficult when there are two people with so little storage space. (we paid the same price for the two rooms). The bathroom was spacious with separate toilet but if someone is in the shower you cannot use the mirror in the bathroom as it steams up.  There was no mirror in the room to enable you to dry your hair etc, other than the bathroom so ladies beware take a vanity mirror so you can get ready whilst the bathroom in being used by your other half. Beds were very comfortable and even though we looked out into the street noise was not a problem. Wifi very good. The garden courtyard was a lovely spot to have breakfast.  Breakfast is quiet expensive for a menu of what consists mainly of cooked eggs, scrambled, omelette, poached,  fried etc but there was a good selection of pastries and yoghurt. Coffee is of a very good quality. The ambiance of the courtyard makes it worthwhile paying for the breakfast though, a great way to meet up with friends to start the day.  Papers are in the breakfast area in all languages to use whilst in that lounge.  The roof top terrace was a good place to start the evening.  Lovely  comfortable seating areas with great views.  Other reviewers said it was a bit crowded and the staff not attentive, we did not experience this, lots of seating space and staff so polite.  It is not a dressy up place as you might expect so nice to have a relaxing drink before going out.  Booked our tickets for the tourist bus and Sagrada Familia with the concierge.  The Sagrada had a waiting time of almost 2 and half hours when we first arrived,  so it is a good idea to book beforehand and you get a time to go into the cathedral without waiting in the queue.  To sum up, great place to stay, staff are very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is a fifteen minute walk to La Rambla. There are some excellent designer shops around the hotel and some lovely little specialist shops for browsing.  The tourist bus stops just around the corner and this is a great way to get an overview of the city.  I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel for a stay in Barcelona.",5,2014,09,16
40,Superb Hotel,"The Alma Barcelona is ideally situated near important tourist destinations as well as excellent shopping and restaurants, but on a very quiet street.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and their assistance with restaurant reservations and sightseeing recommendations was invaluable.  All of our requests were handled professionally and with a smile.
The rooms are extremely comfortable, with dream-inducing linens and pillows and exceedingly comfortable beds.  Excellent water pressure in WCs too.  And the wifi is the best I've ever experienced in any hotel, anywhere.  Never had a problem. Oh and their workout room is adequate as well!
Their rooftop bar is a beautiful place to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail and to watch the sun set on beautiful Barcelona.  Highly recommend Alma Barcelona.",5,2014,09,15
40,Excellent hotel with wow factor,Booked this hotel for a weekend and after a friendly check in with a glass of Cava in hand we were shown to our room and it was a definite wow factor moment when the door was opened the room was immaculate and we had view of the garden courtyard. The staff were very attentive and were happy to recommend cafés and restaurants for us to eat at although we did eat at the hotel twice and the food was very good - the garden and the rooftop terrace were lovely places to sit and chill out after a days sightseeing and the spa was also very relaxing. My friend and I had a wonderful weekend at this hotel which is down not only to the hotel but to the service of the staff as well,5,2014,09,15
40,Absolutely fabulous,"This hotel was fantastic. The service was impeccable, every staff member was friendly and helpful. They really made me feel welcome and comfortable. The room was spacious, comfortable and decorated in an non-fussy way. There was a free minibar and free wifi which really added to the feeling of value for money. The pool and spa area was very nice and both times I went completely empty. The public areas of the hotel were nicely appointed and the roof terrace offered great views over the city. The location is also excellent for dinning out, shopping and sightseeing. I would definitely come back to stay again. Other hotels should be sent here to learn how it's done.",5,2014,09,14
40,Top class,"We stayed at the alma for 3 nights. The rooms are just awesome. Located off a quiet side street you cannot believe you are so close to numerous restaurants, hop on hop off bus stop. The room is entered by finger print recognition great no lugging keys around. The restaurant served superb food and the staff service was 100% nothing was too much trouble even had a glass of champagne on arrival.  The only down side no tea and coffee facilities in the room. This location is so easy to access the best if barcelona. Nearby are some great restaurants and bars which the staff are only too happy to recommend. English is well spoken by all the staff.",5,2014,09,10
40,Beyond Awesome!,"Stayed here for three nights and the memory lasted for a long time! The location is in a quiet street yet just off the Passeig de Gracia, one of the main attractions where you can dine and shop. The hotel feels modern, stylish, and open. Guests can just chat to each other in a common lounge. Room is spacious and clean with comfortable bed. Amenities are very thoughtful chosen and I do like the brand. And, I just can't forget the innovative way to open your room by using your thumb print. Alma Hotel Barcelon gave me an experience I hardly forget. Will come back one day and highly recommended this hotel!",5,2014,09,09
40,Excellent hotel in a great location!,I had a very nice stay at the Alma Barcelona.  It is a modern property in furnishings and offering keyless fingerprint entry.   It is centrally located just a short block off Passeig de Gracias with high end shopping and restaurants and one block from Casa Mila.  Very pleased and would certainly stay here again.,4,2014,09,09
40,Awesome Alma Hotel!,"Stayed at the Alma for 3 days at the end of a business trip...heaven!  The staff is exceptional in that they provide something just a little bit extra, from offering you something to drink (e.g. coffee, water, wine) while you wait to check in to printing walking directions when you are headed to a specific location.  The hotel beds were comfortable and loved the european down comforter.  

The hotel has a contemporary feel and really nice design (take a look at the different windows overhead in the lobby).  Hotel is in a great district for shopping (all the name designer brands), sightseeing (La Pedrera is 2 blocks away) and dining.

While on business, I stayed a the Pullman Skipper by the beach and had a suite.  I prefer the Alma for comfort and service!",5,2014,09,08
40,Modern hotel - excellent service!,"This is a modern hotel, stylishly decorated and in great location.  The service was excellent, - staff were very helpful and make a number of good recommendations of places to eat and also made reservations if required.   We stayed in an executive suite which was large and spacious with a separate seating area.  The king sized bed was comfortable and the his and hers duvets a different touch.  There was also a complimentary mini bar which included beer, water,  fruit juices and other soft drinks.  The hotel also has a roof top terrace bar which offers excellent views over the city.  The main bar was also good and the garden area was a perfect place to unwind after days exploring the city.  The downside for us was that our room was located on the street side of the hotel - whilst we accept that there will be noise when staying in a city centre hotel, the level of noise from the road, particularly during morning rush hour, did provide an unwelcome wake up call!",4,2014,09,08
40,"Quiet, sleek, incredibly comfortable.","Thank you Alma for the greatest hotel bed we've ever slept on!  Check in was awesome - personal, helpful, mellow.   Fingerprint controlled door locks were awesome.  We always left thinking we forgot our key!   The hotel is in a great, central location.  Rooftop bar is beautiful.   Honestly, this place goes on my top 10 hotel list.",5,2014,09,08
40,Top-notch service!,"For us, it is always service excellence that elevates a hotel/restaurant/attraction to another level, and Alma did so with grace and aplomb. From the moment we stepped into the hotel to the regretful time of departure, we felt comfortable, cared for and completely at ease. Guillermo, who checked us in and then proceeded to familiarize us with the surrounds, attractions and restaurant venues, was a model of affable charm, wit and attentiveness. I'd say promote him, except he really should be kept in the public domain so that all may share in his delightful nature!

The suite was airy, spacious and tranquil. I found the décor soothing, simple, but just a shade impersonal in feel. However, the amenities were all superb, and the fixtures of fine quality. The bed was firm yet comfortable, the separate duvets were a joy; but the pillows were a bit too soft. Although we had asked for a quiet suite, none were available. Our 4th floor suite facing the street meant audible traffic noises, especially loud motorcycles or trucks. The wooden screens dampened the sound a little, but not entirely. Free WiFi, stocked mini-bar of water, juice and beer were much appreciated. Entry into room via fingerprint ID meant one less card to carry and no worries about accidentally locking oneself out. Breakfast bar was well-stocked. I found the fried eggs of an intriguing, fluffy texture, but overly slick with oil; the sausage was strange in texture and bland.

The hotel is close to main boulevards of fancy shops and touristy restaurants. It is also nearby two well-known structures of Gaudi fame. A pleasant stroll takes you to the Gothic and Born quarters, and most famously, the Sagrada Familia, not to be missed. The Metro is also close by, providing easy access to attractions farther away.

The Alma is definitely a hotel we would highly recommend and return to. The excellent staff boosts the overall experience to a much higher level. Bravo!",5,2014,09,08
40,Excellent!!,"First stay at the Alma and now my number one hotel choice in Barcelona.

From the moment of arrival by taxi from the airport until the transfer to our cruise liner the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is quite dimly lit in the hallways however this is part of the ambiance and, quite frankly, is welcome after a few hours of walking around the city shops and landmarks. The rooms we had were extremely spacious and very well furnished. Luckily we had a couple of rooms overlooking the Carrer Mallorca which allowed us to open the shutters and watch the world go by and I can't really remember the noise from pedestrians or traffic so also peaceful.

The central garden is an oasis and lovely to sit in over a nice cool cerveza or something a little stronger after a busy day and although we never ate dinner at the hotel the breakfast service and selection was also excellent.

Overall the hotel is ideally located for shopping and sightseeing and not too far a taxi ride from the airport. As a fan of boutique hotels we loved the decor and furnishings but most of all really appreciated the size of the rooms and bathrooms. If you are planning a visit to Barcelona I would thoroughly recommend this hotel",5,2014,09,08
40,Outstanding stay,"Brilliant location, spacious rooms, great service.
The staff is well trained, show great deal of hospitality.
Internet service is free and fairly fast.
the only thing missing was a coffee machine in the room, the 24 hr room service can serve you coffe whenever you need though.
would love to stay there again",5,2014,09,07
40,Awesome and Trendy-turn down service is all that was lacking,"We loved the decor, the vibe and everything about the interior of the hotel.  We even took some pics so that one day when we build a custom home we can show the builder some things we liked.  

European hotels generally lack in the cozy side of the bed but this place was a perfect 10!  We loved how they had his and her top covers on the bed so we each had our own.  Genius idea.  

You never carry of forget your hotel key as all is accessed by finger scan.  Since it is relatively new make sure to have the address on you or memorized as most cabbies had no clue where it was.

We did not dine there so I cannot comment on food, but the staff was kind and spoke great English,.  My only regret and reason for NOT having 5 stars is that they only did turn down one night.  Sure they came each night to try and do turn down, but they came at like 6-7 pm and we had not left for dinner, so why they would not come back after we had left for dinner is beyond me.  I really enjoy coming home to a straightened out room and a nicely made and tucked in bed.",4,2014,09,04
40,Modern trendy hotel in elegant location. Loved it!,"This trendy and super stylish hotel was everything we hoped for. Situated next to the designer stores off Passage de Gracia, it offers large rooms with cool modern design. We loved the attention to detail, especially at the Breakfast! If you are looking for dark, sleek yet somehow homely for good value and good location this is the place! Ok - there was some drilling from the construction in the building next door, but I guess that can happen. Overall we Loved it!",5,2014,09,03
40,Alma Barcelona,Fantastic Hotel.   Great Location.  Close to shopping and major attractions.   Very Clean and comfortable.  Best of all is the staff!   Very attentive and helpful without being overbearing.  I would stay there again.,5,2014,09,02
40,"You can't loose your room key, it's on your fingertip!","Very stylish, cool hotel in perfect location close to Passeig de Gracia.  Stayed for two nights, for my husbands birthday. Celebrated with Champagne breakfast and the staff was lovely bringing out a little cake with candle as a surprise.  The rooms are very stylish with fabulous beds and bedlinen..
No room key, fingerprint recognition, very James Bond...",5,2014,09,01
40,Outstanding,My husband and I went to Barcelona to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and stayed at The Alma Hotel. The staff were really helpful and assisted us with finding our way around the city as well as recommending places to visit and eat. They helped to make the trip one we will remember for many years to come. I would highly recommend The Alma Hotel.,5,2014,09,01
40,Warm minimalism,"Imagine a spectacular house in a side street of the Passeig de Gracia, a modern block behind it and a connection between the 2 buildings with a uniform stylish and minimalist, but warm interior. That's Alma. I loved how they turned this place into a very stylish hotel. Don't stay here if you like bling-bling. If you like design, and luxurious minimalism (yes, that exists!), this is your place. I stayed in a standard room with views of the interior courtyard. Room size is great, the bathroom fantastic and all has very high finishings (loved the wood panelling details). Breakfast was very good, very creative in comparison to what you get in most hotels. The staff I met did a great job as well.
Nothing negative? Well, in my room I could hear the music that was played on the terrace in the evening. However, I never heard anything from the neighbours or the corridors.
It was my fifth stay in Barcelona and this was definitely the best out of 5 hotels I stayed.",5,2014,08,31
40,excellent stay at the Alma,"stayed for four days in August 2014. room was delightful, quiet, fresh and clean.
showers and all facilities excellent.staff service was exceptional. food very good.
location was perfect. backs onto Goudy's Pedrera, short walk to Segreda Familia, 
easy walk to restaurants, shopping, La Rambla, medieval district etc.",5,2014,08,31
40,"Central, Modern and Very Sauve","We were made welcome as soon as we arrived, given a glass of Cava - the local 'champagne' of Catalonia - while sitting to check-in. The Receptionist gave details and advice on local attractions, Metro, and tourist bus routes. We wanted to visit 'La Pedrega' and 'La Segrada Familia', famous Gaudi creations and both are within walking distance - in fact the former is right behind the hotel! The hotel features finger door activation which we found to be brilliant, no forgotten keys, and the system worked wonderfully. The room was spacious and spotless, the bed soo.. comfortable with a huge double with individual duvets. A his and hers wash hand basin, massive shower and separate toilet, free mini-bar, black-out windows  -  really this is a five star hotel right in the centre of Barcelona with easy access  to La Rambla. If you are in doubt as to where to stay you can't go wrong with the Alma - the best hotel we have ever stayed in and I haven't even mentioned the roof-top bar overlooking the city with a fabulous atmosphere! Look no further, you have found the hotel of your dreams. Yes a bit on the pricy end, but quality always comes at a price and this is money well spent. We loved our stay and will be back next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2014,08,29
40,Excellent Hotel and its Staff,"Me and partner had a lovely 4 days in  the Alma Hotel Barcelona over the Bank Holiday and i cannot fault the hotel nor its excellent staff, who made our stay one of the best city break holidays we have enjoyed, and would not look at anywhere else to stay in Barcelona.  
We enjoyed this hotel so much, that we will now look to stay at other the Alma hotels in Europe where possible in the future.",5,2014,08,27
40,The service lets it down,"My partner whisked me away to Barcelona as a 30th birthday treat, and we stayed in the Alma for 3 nights. 

The hotel had an impressively modern yet gothic atmosphere inside, which lended it an exclusive air. But this also made the hotel feel a bit cold and - dare I say - uninviting. Couple this with at-times aloof service, and the vibe in the common areas didn't make me feel particularly welcome.

We had to wait a little while for both check-in and check-out. Once we sat down at the check-in desk, we were given glasses of champagne, which was a nice touch. Beyond that, the hotel staff offered no special touches to make my 30th birthday special - and the champagne at check-in is offered to everyone. 

The concierge was swift and efficient when asked to secure a table at a popular seafood restaurant in Barceloneta. However, this basic level of service is what I expect as standard in a 5-star hotel.

The best part of the hotel in my opinion was the room. Clean lines, big bed, luxurious linens, massive walk-in shower and loads of storage space. I definitely got some great nights' sleep.

We ordered room service one evening, and the food arrived promptly and was of a good standard. The cost was reasonable.

All in all, the Alma was indeed a spectacular-looking hotel with exceptionally comfortable and modern rooms. The level of service, however, let the Alma down. When you're paying this much for a hotel, your stay extends beyond the room.",3,2014,08,26
40,Great hotel,Top location / great service / very confortable rooms / Excellent experience / very calm / close to all the shops / good price / love the fingerprint technology so you don't have to worry about the key,5,2014,08,26
40,"Great location, stylish boutique hotel in Barcelona","This was my fourth trip to Barcelona and so far best hotel location I have stayed. Only 3 week back we stayed a long weekend with the 1891 next to The Ramblas - allthough they had better spa and an outdoor pool plus the breakfast was served at the rooftop garden, the Alma had much nicer and posher location. Passeig de Gracia beats Ramblas hands down.

Very stylish, upmarket hotel especially for travellers without kids. Staff very helpful, friendly yet professional. True 5 *",5,2014,08,25
40,Wonderful stay,"Our stay at the Alma has been exceptionally good. Our suite is much larger than you ever find in a European city center, and full of thoughtfully sized cupboards and spaces for everything. The bathroom and shower are hypermodern and luxurious. The staff is friendly and helpful and the indoor pool is surprisingly useful and comforting for its size. We loved every detail from the bedside chocolates to the fingerprint scanner. The location is right in the middle of the ruckus  at passaeig de garcia yet the suite is wonderfully quiet. Well done!",5,2014,08,18
40,The Alma was perfect for us,"We spent 3 nights at the Alma two weeks ago and it totally lived up to our expectations. Well situated to see many of the sights and in a very nice part of the city, the Alma is a cool, elegant but ultra- comfortable hotel with a minimalistic look and feel - very contemporary Barcelona. The staff are professional , friendly and helpful and our room was large, quiet and airy with a big comfortable bed, overlooking a pleasant courtyard and garden. The bathroom was enormous and well epuipped. The one breakfast we ate at the hotel was delicious and the service was attentive. If you want an upmarket, non touristy, luxury hotel the Alma will delight you.",5,2014,08,18
40,Par excellence!!!,"Very high tech, very minimalistic, staff extremely efficient, courteous and helpful. So relaxing after a long day of touring and shopping. It's located in the best area of Barcelona for shopping and touring...loved!!!",5,2014,08,18
40,Superb hotel,"Wonderful hotel. Had a room with view of the Casa Mila's rooftop which was spectacular. Location was excellent and we could walk to every major attraction. Room was elegant and clean, lobby was open spaced which we appreciated.",5,2014,08,16
40,Fantastic hotel,"Outstanding hotel. Very clean and modern. Location excellent.  We stayed there with our older parents and the location was very easy

Rooftop desk was nice at night.  

Breakfast a bit pricey but Starbucks is just 1.5 blocks away",5,2014,08,13
40,Excellent Hotel,Great hotel in a super location. The hotel is modern and new.  The beds were extremely comfy. Every associate was helpful at every interaction. It was a wonderful hotel and I would definately stay there again.,5,2014,08,13
40,Sophisticated oasis,"A sleek and sophisticated hotel situated in a leafy upmarket part of Barcelona.  Great location for sight seeing, the Sagrada Familia is a 20 minute walk away, Gaudi's La Pedrera, is on the next block, Casa Batllo is about 5 minutes away and it is around a 10 - 15 minute walk to the Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla.
The service provided by the black uniformed staff was impeccable, I enjoyed the glass of cava when checking in! One of the staff gave us some excellent restaurant suggestions. The mini bar was complementary, it was stocked with plenty of water, juice, soft drink and a couple of beers. 
If you are not travelling with your significant other please note that there is no door to the bathroom, which is more like a wet room as there is no door to the shower.",5,2014,08,11
40,Pleasant Stay,"Overall a very pleasant stay and a highly recommended hotel.  We will stay here again if we return to Barcelona and have already recommend this hotel to family members who have booked their trip.  Comments:

Pros

- Free minibar including beer, water and juices. 
- Good shower, bathroom and toiletries
- Comfortable bed but configured as two adjoining single beds (with individual duvets).  Very comfortable but not very romantic!
- Overall look and feel of the hotel (interior design) was very cool and understated but yet felt warm, welcoming and comfortable.  Fingerprint access to the rooms is a nice feature that saves having to carry keycards etc
- Good location, walkable to the vast majority of attractions.  Quiet street but meters away from the main shopping area
- Very pleasant and welcoming staff.  All the staff we met were very friendly, welcoming and professional.  At checkin you are offered a welcome drink and the staff take the time to give a brief overview of the local area
- Free and fast wifi 
- Spacious room, nicely designed and whilst a city hotel is often just a bed to sleep in, the Alma was a comfortable place to relax and unwind
- Quiet roof terrace (when we were there) but nice ambience and good views across the city

Cons (Only one...)

- No iron or ironing board (informed this was due to security reasons..?).  Tip use the hotel laundry / go to El Corte Ingles where you can buy a small iron for EUR 25..",5,2014,08,09
40,A hub of calm and style in the city,"We had a romantic get-away here that I will always remember! Stylish modern hotel, with sleek design and a beautiful and romantic garden. The garden has so many trees, it made me feel almost like I was in the countryside, even though the hotel has a perfect central Barcelona location. Nice spa with sauna, steam bath and pool. Had a delicious dinner and breakfast, with many local specialties. Dinner: don't miss the Rice with Mantis Shrimp, it was incredible!!! And for breakfast, there is a great selection of local cheeses, and my favourite: sandwiches with salmon and caviar. Afterwards we went for drinks on the rooftop bar, with good cocktails and a view of Barcelona. But the best of our stay was the personal service, staff went out of their way to make us feel like at home.",5,2014,08,08
40,Flawless stay,"Can't really come up with anything negative. The check-in with a glass of cava, the room, the breakfast, the roof terrace, the location... I'm just repeating all the other reviews; everything was top-notch.

We stayed in an executive room which was very spacious and super quiet even though it was on the street side on second floor. 

We visited also two neighbouring roof terrace bars, ""Alaire"" and ""Terraza 83,3"", but Alma's terrace was way nicer.",5,2014,08,05
40,"Stunning property, top-notch service","My wife and I loved every minute of our stay at the Alma Barcelona. We were welcomed at check-in with a glass of cava and an efficient tour of the modern property, which has a very clean and trendy feel, akin to a more refined W Hotel. Our room was large and comfortable, with an oversized bed, a large bathroom, commodious closets and a refrigerator stocked with several gratis beverages. The common spaces were even more striking, notably the roof deck on which we passed several hours drinking Alma's reasonably-priced cocktails and eating a pizza ordered for us by one of the hotels many helpful staff members. The breakfast, while ambitiously priced, was phenomenal, with a wide selection of local meats, cheeses and yogurts. Finally, the internet was blazing fast. If back in Barcelona, we'd return in a heartbeat.",5,2014,07,30
40,"Great property, service and location","Super friendly staff, good food and basically no negatives rendered us very satisfied with the experience! The location is nice with walking distance to La Rambla. The hotel is very neatly decorated and exorts a calm feeling.",5,2014,07,28
40,Fabulous hotel with very friendly staff,"Fabulous hotel with very friendly staff. This is the perfect place to stay in Barcelona, short walk to Sagrada Familia (20 min), La Pedrera and Casa Batllo. Beautiful view from the Roof terrace over the city.",5,2014,07,28
40,Great hotel,"We just came back from a 5-day stay in Barcelona. The stay couldn't have been better. The location is superb. It's in the midst of a beautiful Eixample neighborhood, and only a short walk (less than 5 minutes) from The Pedrera. Unfortunately, The facade of The Pedrera is completely covered while it is undergoing renovation. But just being a stone's throw from the Passeig de Gracia is a huge bonus. Every important sight is either within walking distance (for example, the Sagrada Familia), or a short taxi ride away. The rooms are indeed minimalist by design, as other reviewers have noted. The design of the shower and bathroom may take a bit of getting used to for some people, but we had no problem with it. The beds are very comfortable and, despite being so close to the action, the room felt like an oasis of calm. By the way, the service is outstanding. Always friendly and helpful.",5,2014,07,27
40,I loved this hotel!,"This was the perfect place to stay in Barcelona, so glad we made this choice. We actually stayed two times once at the beginning of our trip to Spain for 2 nights and then one more night at the end of our trip. The staff was so incredibly helpful, nice and accommodating. The rooms are sort of minimalist modern but very nice and comfortable and we found the location to be very good as well. Walking distance to many sights/shops and easy enough to get around by cab if not. We had three great dinner recommendations from the staff each night. The first night we ate at Toto which was really good and within walking distance. The second night we went to a traditional, old style Paella place called Cheriff. Incredible Paella and nice area to walk around after dinner. The last night we went to a more modern Paella place on the water called Barraca, the food was amazing and the view was perfect! There is also a really cute rooftop bar at the hotel which we enjoyed one night. You can't ask for better service than we received at this place. I don't have any complaints and I wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel!",5,2014,07,26
40,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","This is centrally located, making it a great base for walking or taking the metro.  Our check-in was done by someone who seemed rather distracted.   I couldn't help but overhear rhe check-in next to us - the receptionist was warm, welcoming, funny and informative.  In contrast, we were just registered for the fingerprint key system and handed a map.  We stayed in an Executive Suite which had good space and a nice bathroom.  There were a few design featurea that I did not find appealing.  The hotel common areas, halls and the suite itself were all painted very dark colors and were also dimly lit.  This was somewhat oppressive.  In addition, the bedroom outlets were in short supply.  However,  these aren't huge issues and this is a solid choice in Barcelona. ",4,2014,07,24
40,Finger Power,"On Carrer Majorca, (about1/2 mile 1K from Las Ramblas) with a great sized garden for dinning or just a drink, unfortunately it's where you'll also find all the smoking monkeys too :-(
very big rooms for Barcelona...The rooms are all keyless entry & your fingerprint is used which worked every time for me over an 8 day stay, a very quick and easy thing to do...not sure how many people each room can allow to have their finger assigned each stay though.
Bar restaurant food was good o very good, Veggie options were available & Vegan ones were but only by skipping ingredients from the menu, but all the staff were very helpful & accommodating to strange dietary requirements :-) 
Breakfast was good with Soya milk already out :-)..but too late as it starts at 07:00 & not 06:30
Really comfortable bed with a good hard mattress & soft topper too. My room was at the back overlooking the garden & thus quiet, so a great sleep every night.
Wifi was okay & worked pretty much everywhere. Unusual for BCN the Alma has a pool..in the basement though not on the roof so it's larger than any I've come across in the city.",4,2014,07,22
40,The only one for me,"I first stayed at this hotel a few years ago and since then, I have stopped searching for other hotels. This is a design hotel from every angle. Rooms are excellent (book the executive suite) and the restaurant is fabulous (very nice breakfast as well, my egg white omelet was always perfect).  Location can not be beat, 30 seconds from Paseo De Gracia. Staff is warm and always very welcoming. I have stayed here three times in the last few months and going again three times before the year is out, this is where I will stay. Enough said.",5,2014,07,21
40,Fantastic hotel!!,"We recently had the good fortune to visit Barcelona and stayed at the Alma Hotel.  From the word go the staff here couldn't do enough for you.  The reception we received was amazing, we were seated and asked if they could get a drink for us (which was lovely as it was a very warm day), our cases were already being taken to our room while we checked in.  The room was lovely,with the most comfy bed and feather pillows and duvets.  Everything was lovely and clean.  I cannot praise this hotel enough!!",5,2014,07,21
40,Perfect All Around,"This was my second trip to Barcelona.  The first time we stayed at the famous Hotel Arts near the Olympic Village at the end of Barceloneta.  I much more preferred Alma than Hotel Arts.  Alma is in an ideal location right off Paseig de Gracia to visit all of the major Barcelona sights.  The hotel itself has very comfortable rooms, a great bar area with outdoor patio, and an unbelievable roof deck to enjoy cocktails overlooking the city.  The quality of the staff was also fantastic.  I would without question stay here again.",5,2014,07,20
40,They are very close,"I always try to be 100% honest on any review and admit to finding it hard being decisive on the comments to submit.
Negatives first. The reception area is dark and dismal, not welcoming in any way. This should be looked at. The bedroom card (Do not disturb) has just one side to use and once you hang on your door, either way, your room will not be serviced. Breakfast, if you are room basis only, seems a little expensive, so study carefully hotel offers available.
The positives far exceed the above. Rooms are carefully designed with clever little modern touches and quiet. The restaurant very good with an excellent menu to choose from. There is a wonderful garden area in which to relax or have your drinks/ meals and also a splendid roof terrace, divided into two sections, one on the city side and one on with a sea view.
The best left till last. All members of staff were brilliant. Helpful, extremely polite and willing to provide assistance wherever they could. A credit to whoever is responsibly for their training.
They are very close to becoming a top class city hotel and we would most certainly stay here again when visiting Barcelona.",4,2014,07,18
40,Great location and excellent staff,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights last week as a bit of birthday treat and overall it can only be described as a wonderful experience. As soon as we arrived our luggage was whisked away to our room and as we were booking in we had chilled drinks offered, our receptionist was a font of knowledge who seem to genuinely enjoy helping us. The rooms are big enough, the layout is not exactly my taste but my wife thought the whole open plan look was wonderful. The bed was very comfortable the furniture very modern and smart, of course another soft chair wouldn’t have gone amiss. All throughout our stay the staff were courteous, smart, helpful and they really did seem to care how much we enjoyed our trip. The location is about 10 mins walk from Plaça de Catalunya which must be one of the nicest roundabouts in the world. Which leads into the old area of Barcelona with wonderful architecture and great pubs and restaurants, you will be spoiled for choice. Honestly I am a new fan of Barcelona which means we will return as soon as possible and when we return we will be staying at the Alma again.",5,2014,07,17
40,Amazing city hotel,"We stayed three nights in July 2014 to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. The staff were amazing, friendly and so helpful. They recommended and booked fantastic restaurants for us and even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our special occasion.

All the receptionist staff and concierge were really kind and remember us each day - you felt you had personal treatment at alll times. Our room was ready earlier than planned and we were greated with a welcome drink which was very nice.

The hotel facilities were clean, tidy and inviting. The bed and pillows were so comfortable after a day sightseeing. Cannot fault anything at all.  Hotel  ot to be missed.

We will definitely return soon.!!!",5,2014,07,16
40,"Nice rooms, but really poor service over the whole week","At over $500 a night, the suite was great... but we could not get basic service each day.  For some unknown reason, they would remove 1 day old bars of soap, so even when we asked for an extra, we were back down to one the next day, and every day.  2 sinks and a shower and a bath require more than a single bar of soap.  Each day we would need to talk housekeeping (my wife is a native spanish speaker) and it made no difference.  Extra towels, whatever, it was never consistent.  They also recommended the Cheriff restaurant, amongst the worst we have every been to, it was awful.  Speaking to the front desk made only temporary differences.  Do yourself a favor, and get a different better hotel.",3,2014,07,15
40,Best hotel in town!,"My husband and I stayed there for 4 nights weeks ago. it was a blast! We were first welcomed by the cheerful faces of the staff and the welcome drinks! We arrived much earlier than our expected arrival time, but the room was ready when we checked in. The staff was excellent, frendly and attentive to details.   The room was spacious. Our room was on the 6th floor facing the courtyard. It was so quiet and defintely helped for a deep sleep. The complimentary mini bar was a bonus. The location was just perfect. Its only a 2 min walk from the hotel to the nearest metro station (Diagonal) and you could find all luxury brands you want downstairs along Passage de Gracia. We just simply love this chic hotel. Will definitely recommend  to our family and friends!",5,2014,07,14
40,"Great Staff, Great Hotel and Perfect Location","We stayed at the Alma for 2 days and it was wonderful.  The staff was excellent, they made numerous reservations, recommended restaurants and activities that made our stay in Barcelona perfect.  The rooms were spacious, had a complimentary mini bar and windows that opened to a beautiful courtyard.

We loved this hotel and can't wait to return.",5,2014,07,10
40,Don't go there,"This hotel is prentensius, overpriced and badly managed.
On our entry to the much advertised garden terrace we were turned around, saying it was reserved for a private party, but were advised to go to the roof terrace. Once there we could not get a proper chair because it was ' reserved' so much for 5 stars",1,2014,07,09
40,Great Location... fabulous hotel,"This hotel was perfect.
Rooms perfect, bed so comfortable.  Great shower and bathroom amenities.
Food was very good.  I have breakfast and lunch in the hotel.  Breakfast was perfect
Staff were brilliant.
Great rooftop bar and deck.  They make the largest gin and tonics ever",5,2014,07,08
40,"Modern, minimalist, quiet, sophisticated","Great location in a part of Barcelona full of restaurants and high quality shops. Check in was easy and quick. Staff attentive and very happy to recommend and book restaurants. We stayed in room 101. Beautiful large room, fantastic king sized bed with soft cotton linen and a duvet each! Nice lounge area, large bathroom with a bath and a shower with very large shower head. Decor is minimalist (Philip Stark?), lighting very low, almost too low, moody, but it adds to the atmosphere. If your eyesight is bad, it will be difficult to see! Terrace outside the back is beautiful and calm for the centre of Barcelona. We opted not to have breakfast as it was pricy but it looked good. If you want a modern, new hotel with beautiful linen, helpful staff, quiet hotel that will leave you feeling relaxed after a busy day in a bustling city, this is for you! ",5,2014,07,07
40,Great location and great staff,"We stayed at the Alma for two nights.
This is a very hip and modern style hotel in the center of the downtown.

We had room 101, large clean, great bath and had a small balcony. 2 great tv, lots of seating, and spacious .  The staff is the best!  Truly extremely helpful and very pleasant.

Food is excellent and the roof bar is great.

There is a spa and pool.  The pool is interesting, it is inside the spa.

One drawback is they have ver low lighting.  If you get a room like 113, it is painted a dark blue, very hard to see in the room, not enough light, so if this is an issue make sure you ask for a light painted room.

The reason this is not an excellent rating iS the bed.  It is very soft and low to the ground  not great for people over 60.  Otherwise this hotel deserves 5 stars!

Also, it is in a quiet neighborhood, peaceful and just down the street from Sagrada Familia and great shopping!

Also the price is fantastic for all that you get including free wifi!",4,2014,07,06
40,Great Hotel,The staff was wonderful.  The room was very well appointed.  The entire space and experience was fantastic.  It is situated in a part of Barcelona that is very laid back part of the city.  This is our second visit to Barcelona and the west side of town and in particular Exiempla and Gracia are the best locations.  We would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,07,03
40,Chic European Boutique Hotel,"We booked the Alma suite for two nights (27 & 28 June).  The taxi ride from the airport was about 15 minutes and the hotel itself is nestled in an ideal location, about a 15 minute walk from Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia in one direction and the unique walking/people watching area of las Ramblas in the other.  In addition, the hotel is located right next to (literally) the Calle de Gracia which is Barcelona's upscale shopping district where you'll find high-end retail chains like Louis Vuitton and Gucci for those who like to shop.  Our luggage was lost in route from the U.S. and we were more than a little frustrated as a result.  We were greeted by Michael upon arrival at the hotel who was extremely helpful in orientating us on our first stay in this amazing city.  

The Alma suite is spectacular.  An enormous living area, a large bedroom, a very comfortable terrace, and the largest and most spa-like bathroom I've ever seen in a hotel.  The décor is modern, but warm.  It's clear that the hotel partnered with an excellent decorator.  We personally liked the fingerprint door entry at our suite.  In contrast with other reviewers, the technology worked perfectly for us every time.  

As we went to and fro the hotel, the doorman Marcos was also especially helpful, recommending places to go (and avoid).  In fact we didn't come across one rude staff member throughout our stay and I would describe the customer service as ""excellent"" and ""very welcoming"".  Breakfast downstairs is a little on the expensive side, and the food spread is typical European continental with a variety of meats, cheeses (good selection), and breads.  Staff member will make you an espresso, cappuccino or café au lait upon request (done very well).  There's also an outdoor garden which is very peaceful in this busy city.  We didn't visit the spa.",5,2014,07,01
40,"Great hip hotel, great location","Excellent hotel, within close walking distance to Case Billo, La Pedrera, and Sagrada Familia. Hip and modern yet professional. Excellent breakfast (though you'll pay a lot for it). Beautiful workout facility with steam bath and lap pool. Very easy for English speaking tourists.
My only real complaint: their ""fingerprint"" key system just doesn't work. It is way too sensitive; someone invested a lot of money in a system that is a white elephant. Were it not for that I'd have given it 5 stars",4,2014,06,29
40,Modern Minimalist,"If minimalist is your cup of tea, stay in this hotel.

Location: perfect in the main shopping area, just opposite to Casa Batllo and Casa Mila, but still quiet.
Reception: very friendly and efficient. Introduce a lot of Barcelona sights.
Room: reasonably sized, clean and modern. Though simple, you can see the quality of the furniture is very high. Free mini bar is a very welcoming treat. The only negative side is the small size of working table.  
Bathroom: the shower is VERY large with high ceiling. Excellent water pressure. Very conformable.
Swimming pool: located in the basement and feel isolated. Dont want to stay nor swim here.
Rooftop bar: perfect view for the city.",4,2014,06,24
40,Great location service oriented!,"I spent a lot of time reviewing what hotel to stay in for two nights before we went on our cruise of the coast of Spain. I made the right choice. This hotel is just what the reviews said. Very service oriented and extremely professional. We were greeted by a doorman and offered a beverage on arrival, cappuccino was great!  Our room was ready at 9 am (upgraded without a request) when we arrived for a short nap and on to take in a few sights. Room was very clean and sheik. Cool shower and sink.   Perfect location to shopping area of the locals, not touristy at all, which is what I was looking for. A short walk and there are several breakfast venues if you want to spend less money. Did not have a dinner in hotel so I can not comment. Overall very nice hotel.",5,2014,06,24
40,Bathroom unlike others,"During a spring break trip to Barcelona, we had an occasion to stay at the Alma. The hotel is well situated for restaurants, bus transport, subways, and walking to sites. It is a modern, clean hotel, with minimalistic furnishings. The staff was exceptionally well-trained and patient. However, we did not heed the warnings posted on trip advisor prior to the trip about the lack of privacy in the bathrooms. Truly, this was a negative. The first bathroom was not a room, but a space situated behind a folding wooden screen. We asked for another. We ended up in a corner room designed for wheelchairs. The bathroom had no door. Water splashed everywhere - there was no shower door either. It is NOT for everyone. Given all the positives of the hotel - sure hope that they make adjustments based on feedback that they hear about their bathroom set-up.",3,2014,06,17
40,Excellent hotel with friendly staff and great location.,"This hotel is fairly pricey but well worth the money if you can afford to spend it for a bit of luxury. The staff are amazing and very helpful. Your greeted by a doorman sometimes a woman and served with a glass of cava whilst checking in. The room was very clean, the bed is so comfortable it made us envious. The food there was superb and on a different level - the beef melted in the mouth. The mini bar is free and re stocked once a day. The location is great for seeing the sights if you haven't been before and the metro is very close (it puts the English tubes to shame - clean, quick, reliable and air conditioned. Get a T10 ticket that enables two people to travel for 5 trips each. Or walk and enjoy the sights as the stations aren't far apart, the ticket can be used on the Renfe trains (again puts English trains to shame) and the local buses. Overall an excellent hotel and great staff.",5,2014,06,17
40,Great hotel,"Great hotel, friendly staff, loved the fingerprint key! Perfectly situated.The lack of a roof top pool might be picky but it would improve the overall experience even more. The breakfast charge is high and I can´t see why it isn't complimentary at ***** hotels.",5,2014,06,17
40,Excellent,"Really enjoyed our 3-night stay, wished it was longer.  Wonderful staff were friendly and very helpful.  Fabulous bed, so comfortable.  It was very quiet (our room was overlooking the garden), amazing when you step onto the street outside, it's so busy after the peaceful atmosphere inside the hotel.  Good food and wine.  Complimentary water, beer and juices in the room mini-bar, restocked daily.  The hotel was busy so we were not able to extend our stay.  Our flight was late afternoon and we were able to use the spa for a shower before we left.",5,2014,06,15
40,A Beautiful and Serene Hotel Experience,"We stumbled across the Alma initially last year for dinner while staying in Barcelona and decided to look after a room after a delicious dinner. We came back a year later for a long weekend and have thoroughly enjoyed the Alma as a hotel.
Situated just off the Passeig de Gracia it is in the centre of Barcelona, near Las Ramblas, and in a brilliant spot for shoppers! It is also an easy enough walk down to the sea. 
All the staff have been beyond helpful and any little niggles we had were smoothed over instantly. 
The dim lighting and dark walls make for a very calm atmosphere and lovely quiet experience, along with possibly the most comfortable beds I have ever experienced. 
The Alma is so worth staying at and puts the typically americanised luxury hotels to shame. Even if you don't stay at the Alma, DO eat dinner at the restaurant, very respectable prices for the quality of the food. 

The rooftop terrace/bar is unmissable; spend a lazy summer evening drinking cocktails while looking out over the view to Barcelona's skyline.",5,2014,06,14
40,Stylish Hotel in Central Barcelona,"The Alma Hotel is very stylish with the latest technology in many areas: i.e finger print access to rooms - there are also some unusual design aspects such as limited separation between bathroom and bedroom area for the non-suite rooms at the rear but if you book a room at the rear of the hotel it will be very quiet which is quite a find in this all action, hustle, bustle City. The front desk staff are excellent and the location for visiting the many sights in Barcelona is very good",4,2014,06,12
40,Great,"Great place, great location and the most... great service.

I recommend this hotel highly, particularly for romantic trips rather than for family trips.

The people that work in this place are just super helpful and nice!!!",5,2014,06,12
40,Best hotel ever,"Couldn't fault anything. Perfect in every way. Stunning room. Very friendly staff. Would definitely recommend here.

Couldn't fault anything. Perfect in every way. Stunning room. Very friendly staff. Would definitely recommend here.",5,2014,06,11
40,Superb Hotel,"Perfect location - great part of the city and central to lots of attractions.

Hotel is very modern, clean and comfortable. I loved the fingerprint scanners instead of a room key! 

Very peaceful and relaxing outdoor hidden garden area.

Would highly recommend!",5,2014,06,09
40,Fabulous property and service!,We just stayed at the Alma for 6 days and thought it to be a great choice. The location is perfect. The property is gorgeous. The rooms are nicely sized and the hotel is so incredibly quiet and peaceful. Best of all was the customer service on all levels from everyone we encountered. Excellent stay!,5,2014,06,09

40,"Great, just great","We stayed here at the end of May. This Hotel is wonderful. The service could not be better. It is modern and cool, and in a great part of the City right off Paseo De Gracia. The rooms are also modern, but plush. The restaurant is great, and so too is the spa. 

Not a bad thing can be said about this property.",5,2014,06,06
40,Great place!,"Very nice hotel. We got in early in the morning and they had a room ready for us at 10am. Very nice after 10 hours of traveling!  Great location but yet very quiet, super comfortable beds. Modern, very tastefully decorated,",5,2014,06,04
40,the best,"thx for a fantastic stay, could not have been better :-) great staff, fantastic room, spendid food, super back yard!!! i really really enjoyed staying at this hotel, and hope i come back one day!!!!!!",5,2014,06,01
40,"Great Hotel, Brilliant Staff, Lovely Garden, Well Located","We stayed at the Alma during the last week of May and had an excellent experience.  The welcome at reception on arrival was one of the best at any hotel we've stayed at - comfy seats, refreshments, and annotations to the Alma map of the city based on some of the things we - and our six year old - wanted to visit.  Bags were whisked away and were in our room when we got there and we were set up with wifi access for four devices (decent speed despite other comments).  All told, we were made to feel very welcome.

Location:  a short walk from Passeig de Gracia Metro station, giving easy access to Placa de Catalunya, the centre of everything (Metro interchanges, L7 to Tibidabo, tourist buses).

Retail / neighbourhood note:  the Alma is near a Ferrari outlet, Louis Vuitton and other such extremely upscale retail brands, and frankly, I'm more likely to shop at Mango and North Face down the road; the Alma, however, is informal, calm, well-designed, rather beautiful and you don't need to spend $20k a night to stay there, despite its neighbours.

The Room:  an Exec Suite with an extra bed for the six year old - good size, really nice bathroom - esp the shower, which had good pressure, coverage and consistent heat- and very deep bath. Fingerprint access to the room worked well and not having to take a key out in the morning was one less thing to think about (more important to take cameras, phones, etc!).
Shutters provided privacy from the office across the street and stopped light leaking in in the morning to wake the six year old.  Very comfy bed, good climate control, nice decor.
Reservations:  no Bluray player, no iPod dock and maybe the room was just a *little* too dark during the day.

The Breakfast:  63 Euros for the three of us and without doubt, way too expensive - disproportionately so by comparison with the rest of the food and drink options during the rest of the day. 
It *was* very good - churros & chocolate, muesli, fruit, yoghurt, lot of different cheese, cold meats, a wide variety of bread, pretty good coffee, juice and eggs to order.  The waiting staff, it has to be said, were charming and very helpful.
An alt recommendation - Restaurante Norte on c/Diputacio - lovely local organic place with a small amount of seating.

The Garden & Bar:  Big space bearing in mind the urban location, well planted and you're quite well sheltered from the washing lines hanging out from neighbouring apartment blocks. Decent selection of spirits & wine- I had a Hendrick's gin and tonic, which was large, very tasty and poured at the table.  Nice atmosphere and very relaxing after wandering around the city all day.

Overall:  The Alma has many things going for it and only a few negatives - we'd definitely stay again and would recommend to others.  The biggest plus?  Consistently helpful, friendly, smiley staff who were as good with directions and local recommendations as with our six year old, who loved his stay.  Happy six year old on family holiday really does often make for a happy family, but we *all* really enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,06,01
40,A sanctuary,"An oasis in the middle of the city, excellent staff, a sanctuary.
Beautiful spa with indoor pool, steam, sauna, showers, etc
Good restaurant and beautiful terrace for cocktails.
Rooms are big , minimalist style, free minibar and beautiful.
Excellent hotel. Excellent staff.",5,2014,05,31
40,"Alma Bareclona, Very hospitble with great service","From the first moment we arrived we were treated like VIPs, by the staff by whisking our bags to the room, facilitating a super-fast check-in. Everyone of the staff we encountere, except maids, spoke perfect and clear Englsh. Elsewher in Barcelona this mostly seem to be the case too.

The hotel has recently been modified and redecorated top to bottom and reflects a very clean minimalist design vocabulary.

Our grand deluxe room was huge with separate TV in the bedroom and siting room. The bath has a great walk-in shower plus and immense tub and toilet and bidet. Surprisingly, the tub filled in just a few minutes - the rooms have large pipes with lots of pressure.

The Alma Barcelona hotel has one restaurant and the same items are offered day and night. Each dish we chose was superb. Have no fear there are so many good Catalan and other foord restaurants just steps away you'll never have to repeat a restaurant twice. And walking along Carre Gracia is so beautiful. Two of Gaudis' masterworks are within a 5 minute stroll. 

Barcelona has grand avenues like Paris, however the designs are more fantastical and much less similar to each other than Parisian grand buildings.

Years ago we strolled the Ramblas only about a 15 minute wald from the hotel, but the Ramblas is now heavily devoted to tourist trinket shops and hordes of people.",4,2014,05,27
40,Fantastic hotel with service to match!,"Everything you expect in a 5 star hotel...attentive staff willing to cater to all of your needs, larger than average, well appointed rooms, excellent fitness facilities and internet,  very good food and beverage, and location, location, location. But I cannot over stress the front desk's friendly service. ",5,2014,05,26
40,Amazing hotel and service,"My five day stay at the hotel alma was amazing right from the first minute of arriving. The staff were perfect hosts offering advice and helping sort failed transfers from Ryan air. The rooms are basic layout but are classic and stylish. There is the choice of card or fingerprint room access,. The rooms come with two rainfall shower heads, excellent shower products and and amazing nights sleep in the centre of barcelona.
The spa is excellent and all visitors have free fingerprint access to 10m 0.9m deep pool, steam and sauna rooms plus gym equipped with treadmill, bike TRX and pilTes equipment. I would recommend anyone to stay here.",5,2014,05,24
40,Perfect,"My wife and I ended a week in Spain with a few nights here. It was wonderful. So peaceful, so luxurious. 

The detailing of the room was top-notch - heavy soundproof doors, beautiful leather furniture, lovely wood floor, rainforest shower and huge tub. 

The atmosphere was hushed and peaceful - no loud groups or screaming kids.

The staff recommendations for local restaurants were excellent. The breakfast buffet was another highlight - I spent about 2 hours quietly drinking coffee and reading the paper.

(Be sure to check out the spa. We pretty much had the place to ourselves - infinity pool, sauna, steam room.)",5,2014,05,24
40,Quality hotel in convenient location,"The Alma is a classy hotel well located for the main tourist sights, a manageable walk from both the old town and the Sagrada Familia, also very close to the train station for trains to the airport.  Very attractive lobby area and small garden, offering free rum tastings while we were there.  Rooms not particularly large but adequate; I can't agree with the previous reviewer who complained about the noise, I too am sensitive to noise in hotel rooms but we were on the 5th floor facing the road and barely heard anything.  The staff were unfailingly charming and helpful, I particularly like the way they can print you a little map when you need to know the way somewhere.  The hotel seems expensive but from the TripAdvisor reviews maybe that is what you pay here.  Minor gripes; almost complete absence of hooks in the room so you're always looking for somewhere to put your coat, also having the toilet some way from the bathroom takes some getting used to.  One last hint; if you arrive on foot, be warned that the hotel signs in the street are very discrete so look for the street address or you can easily miss it - as we did.",5,2014,05,23
40,Just about perfect,"Everything in this hotel breathes a relaxed atmosphere. It starts when you enter. No fuss when checking in, no rush in signing papers and giving your credit card. No waiters or bell boys looking for a tip. The rooms are VERY quiet, no noise gets in from windows or the walls. We had a fantastic bathroom with seperate toilet, shower, bath, double sink.
Breakfast is a rathed limited choice, but you can ask your eggs as you like them (not well enough cooked in my case). Orange juice is fresh as it should be.
You can use room keys or fingerprint access. Most people seem to fear this: 'I don't want my fingerprints in some sort of database'. Yeah right, as if they aren't in there already :)
Location is perfect for shopping and visiting. Walk to old city and port are a bit longer",5,2014,05,21
40,SOMETHING IS AMISS!,"Months ago, being a very light sleeper, I requested the quietest room in the hotel. Because of the design of the hotel, there is no such thing as a very quiet room. They should have refused my reservation l made over the phone. First room overlooked back, noise present. Then they gave me 604 - fine, until communion party on roof lasted 9 hours, constant ceiling noise until 10- PM. I had a head cold, and the noise was especially unbearable. Young lady at the front desk      (they have no concierge staff) gave me a map with our restaurant choice marked on it - it turned out to be four blocks away in the other direction from the actual indicated location!  Manager 'Michael' had an attitude when I discussed my issues with him. According to him, no one at the hotel could ever be wrong in any way. We travel extensively, and I am at a loss as to why other guests say the beds are  comfortable.. Way too soft for my aching back. Terribly slow internet - We checked out a day early. Overall, the least desirable of our 3 week, 8 hotel trip.To summarize, good location, but at the core, not a 5 star experience.",3,2014,05,19
40,Easy going fantastic hotel.,"We stayed some nights at the Alma, a very trendy hotel in Barcelona around the corner of the Passeig de Gracia. First experience with possibility of opening doors with your finger print : very conveniant! . Never to think or search for your room key. Food and drinks were of high standard. Staff is super friendly however has problems to serve the guests within a reasonable time when it is busy. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. However this can be easily improved. 
Will go there again. ",4,2014,05,18
40,Superb,"We stayed at this hotel in April 2014. 
The hotel is conveniently located in the downtown area, which made it easy for us to explore the city. 

Our room had ample space and the bed was quite comfortable. 
The breakfast buffet offered a nice variety of food. We found the staff to be courteous and the service at the hotel was exemplary.
 During our stay we thought we had lost a small piece of luggage (it was only out of view behind a window drape in our room). The hotel manager and members of the staff all were extremely helpful and went out of their way to help us locate the luggage. 

Our experience at the Alma was very positive and we would certainly stay there again.",5,2014,05,16
40,Not impressed,"Alma bcn is a beautiful place, rooms are spacious, clean and quiet. Front desk staff is very nice and helpful. Fingerprint roomkey is an excellent system.

But,
Bar and restaurant staff is just... weird.
First day, we sat in the courtyard, had a drink, everything fine. Had a nice lunch, no problem.
A couple of days later, we asked the bartender if we could have dinner (it was 1900hrs), ""sure, no problem, have a seat"". After ten minutes he came and told us that the kitchen would open in half an hour.
The day after that we walked into the place and they were in the middle of service at 19.15.
Also service in the garden was slow and uninterested.

Not what I expect for 250 euros per night",2,2014,05,15
40,Not a five star hotel,"I researched hotels in Barcelona for months and the Alma always came up #4 on tripadvisor under luxury hotels.  I guess some people have a flawless experience at the Alma but we did not.   It was our 40th anniversary and I was looking for something special.  First the positives:  good location, beds were comfortable and room was facing the courtyard and was quiet.  I wish it ended there but my main problem with this hotel is that it is not a five star hotel.  We checked in after a long flight from the United States around 7 p.m.  Check-in was smooth and we opted for the finger pad entry.  It never worked for my husband but worked for me so it was good that we were always together.  We wanted to have some dinner and went down to the restaurant about 8 p.m.  We were not greeted by anyone so we finally went to find someone.   It was only after we decided to leave after 20 minutes that the front desk staff went and found the restaurant manager to get some help.  I ordered fish and that is all I got--a piece of fish with no rice, no vegetable, no bread.  I would not eat in the restaurant as the menu for the dinner is also the dinner for the lunch.   No variety and expensive.
As far as the room, there was a major light out in the room and it took two days to get it replaced.  The  first day we were there we came back to the hotel at 4 p.m. and our room had not been cleaned so we had to sit in the hall and wait for our room.  The  maid came into our room one afternoon and did not knock and found us in bed taking a nap.
In conclusion, we paid 300 Euro for our room and stayed 5 nights.  We have stayed in many five star hotels all over the world and this hotel does not merit a five star rating.   I would say 3 stars and needs improvement still.",3,2014,05,15
40,Excellent Hotel,"Fantastic hotel with great staff. We were really happy with our choice. Its located about 10 mins from La Ramblas which is about as close as you would want to get as its very busy down there. 
My only very small gripe would be the cost of breakfast, while it was very nice at 25 Euros per person i feel this was too expensive.",5,2014,05,13
40,"1st Time in Barcelona, Quiet, Central Location","This hotel had a fantastic, contemporary flare with a refined, quality approach.  The staff were wonderful and even showed some impressive initiative - my boyfriend had been asking them for restaurant recommendations for later that week, to celebrate my birthday and on the evening of my birthday, they sent a complimentary bottle of champagne up to the room for my birthday!  (We did stay for over a week though)  The rooftop terrace was really chic and sophisticated - a quiet place to enjoy the night time view over carefully crafted cocktails.  The rooms were elegant and minimal with glass balconies, which was a first for us.  My only complaint was that the hotel was freezing from the air conditioning.  I went to Barcelona for some warm weather and had to practically had to dress for winter to pass through the hallways, elevator and lobby.  It seem that the most expensive hotels are the coldest - uncomfortably so.  I understand the need to escape the heat, but many hotels tend to go way overboard with freezing temperatures indoors.  Otherwise, a very nice place to stay and just around the corner from a very busy main street.",4,2014,05,13
40,Brilliant decision to stay here,"Some of my friends had said before we came to Barcelona that this was a bit out of the way but I think we chose perfectly. Ten minutes walk from La Ramblas, which was extremely busy yet still perfect for shopping and people watching. Two blocks away were the Rail links which was ideal as we were heading to the Grand Prix on race day.  

As for the rooms, we were not disappointed.  We were given a garden view room which was fabulous, nice and quiet and access granted via a finger scanner.  The shower was fantastic as well as the his and hers sinks.

Although we stayed on a room only basis , we found that we could easily find breakfast from a number of cafés nearby, so save yourself quite a few euros.

We will definitely return! ",5,2014,05,12
40,Excellent Lucky Choice,"We were planning our first visit to Barcelona without the benefit of recommendations.  Like most everyone, we were skeptical of the self-generated grand descriptions most hotels post on travel sites.  Because of its central location and a bit of intuition, we chose the Alma Hotel and it has proved to be an excellent lucky choice.  The Reception Staff is superbly attentive from the moment they spot you out front and hold the door or assist with luggage.  The lobby, restaurant and garden are each both appealing and comfortable as well as tastefully furnished and maintained. Our room, a Junior Suite, was absolutely lovely, had a large bathroom with double sinks, a shower and separate tub and had glass doors off the bedroom and the sitting area that opened onto narrow balconies.  The Reception Staff doubles as the Concierge and they are extensively knowledgeable about sightseeing options and all of the best places to dine in Barcelona.  The Alma Hotel Barcelona, and Staff helped make a first visit memorable. ",5,2014,05,11
40,Wish I could have stayed longer!,"My wife and I ended up booking Alma Barcelona for the last night of our stay since the hotel we were staying at had no more availablility. After just one night in the hotel, we wished that we had booked our entire stay there! Amazing service, great rooms, comfortable beds, a wonderful spa, good location, and the list goes on. This a a wonderful hotel and I highly reccomend staying here!",5,2014,05,11
40,Truly a 5 star hotel,If you are looking for a 5 star hotel in Barcelona - you will not be disappointed! The location is great. We stayed one night at the hotel from Saturday to Sunday. Unfortunately we did not have time to try the indoor swimming pool. ,5,2014,05,11
40,5 Nights in Barcelona,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Alma. Great location, staff were helpful and knowledgable, and room was a good size, comfortable and had lots of space to put suitcases. Didn't have breakfast at hotel but a late night meal was well prepared. Will definitely return.",5,2014,05,06
40,Great hotel in Barcalona,"Lovely hotel in the centre of Barcelona. Check in included a glass of bubbly and, as first timers to the city, a brief overview of our surroundings. Room was gorgeous - very modern at the back of the hotel looking out on to the garden restaurant. Spotlessly clean, and very quiet given the location. Although small, the gym and pool compliments the room decor in its minimal appearance - perfectly adequate for a long weekend away. The hotel is in a great location - situated around the corner from Casa Mila, 15 mins walk from the Sagrada Familia, and near to a couple of Metro stops too. We didn't eat at the hotel - plenty of little cafés round about for breakfast. Would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2014,05,06
40,4 fabulous days in Barca,"Stylish and  comfortable Hotel Alma in the middle of Barca. Very good Service. Very big, fantastic  rooms. Best beds ever. Slept fantastic. Excellent Service .Delicious breakfast. mmhhh...
if we will come back to Barca (hopefully) then definitly to Alma Hotel....",5,2014,05,05
40,"The ""Perfect"" Barcelona Hotel","All the class of a 5 * Plus luxury Hotel with a modern contemporary arty feel and subtle lighting throughout to enhance relaxation.  The Hotel is fantastically located in 5th Avenue surrounded by high end shops and within easy reach of all the city’s main attractions, metro stops etc without being amidst the hustle and bustle. Sacrada Familia is within walking distance for the reasonably fit, Try to pre book Tickets if possible. Approx. 10 euro cab ride to Port Olympic for Bars, Clubs & Beach etc. Approx. 25 min from the Airport
    All the Hotel staff were superb, unlike other experiences of previous staff of hotels of the same rating, they were unpretentious yet extremely professional and attentive with excellent customer service skills.  We were made to feel extremely welcome from the moment we arrived even though it was 1am they treated us as special guests until the second we left, should Pablo the evening concierge or Marcos the day concierge be on duty while you are there you will have no trouble finding what you need as they have the experience & knowledge of Barcelona to tailor make recommendations for the perfect places to suit your situation. Place your trust in their recommendations and you won’t go far wrong.
   Lovely Cafés, bars and restaurants are within easy walking distance, we particularly liked Café Emma for Breakfast and just through the alley opposite the hotel is a French bar located in a cella (Les Gens Que J’aime) which has a lovely cosy relaxed feel and is open until 3am. Perfect for that late wind down drink. The area had a safe feel about it.
We stayed in room 605/607 with friends which was on the top floor. Fingerprint door entry or old fashioned key if required. overlooking the gardens and a view of Gaudis Casa Mila in the distance. Great oversize shower, Large Tv etc… The Bed & bedding was all of high quality and combined with the window shutters that block out all the light & sound you could end up spending most of your stay sleeping.
The Spa is small but functional, Indoor Pool, Steam room & sauna. Complimentary robes and slippers provided for guests and the lift takes you directly. Nice to relax after seeing the sights.
 We would definitely seek to stay in this Hotel again.   

Book this Hotel for a holiday to remember!",5,2014,05,05
40,Fabulous,"Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Alma and have to say it's even better than the reviews we read. Everything from our welcome to the checkout was top class, the ""front of house"" service stood out particularly.  All aspects of the room were very comfortable and the bar service very friendly. We didn't actually eat at the hotel as too many other attractions in the city, but will do next time we stay at the Alma. Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,05
40,Peaceful hideaway,"Alma Barcelona is a lovely hotel in a great location within this beautiful city.  Located just a block from the Casa Mila and just off the Passeig de Gracia with a fantastic range of Designer stores leading down to the Placa Catalunya with Las Ramblas and the Gothic quarter beyond.  
The hotel staff were attentive without being 'fussy' and helpful with any questions or requests.  From the ease of checking-in (with the time taken to provide the city map and highlight places of interest in relation to the location of the hotel) to the ease of checking out, this was a really relaxing stay. 
The bedrooms are beautifully decorated in a modern minimalist style.  Our room on the fifth floor looked out towards the towers of the Casa Mila and over the Hotel garden.  The garden is a green oasis of calm with plenty of comfy sofas and chairs and despite the hotel being on a busy street, the traffic noise could not be heard.  And after a busy day pounding the streets, it was great to be able to relax in the garden before returning to the city for tapas or dinner.   There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the bedrooms but there are so many coffee shops close by that it wasn't a problem.",5,2014,05,05
40,Muy Bien in Barcelona,"we stayed in a Junior Suite at the Alma for one night on 4/20 and loved the hotel, service, our room, and the location.  After our overnight flight we asked if we could check into our room early, 9 am, and since it was available they accommodated us.  Very pleasant customer service on check in and out.  I also left a backpack behind at check out and they called me right away.  The hotel, as other reviews have indicated, is fairly new with a clean modern look.  we would definitely stay there again.  they offer a wonderful breakfast.",5,2014,05,05
40,A wonderful hotel,This is a wonderful hotel. In spite being in the heart of the city the Alma is calm and relaxed.  The staff are extremely attentive and the rooms are beautifully furnished. I cannot recommend this hotel too highly.,5,2014,04,28
40,comfortable,"Alma Barcelona Hotel was unique, modern and fashioned, but so it was not my favourite type. I like something much more classy, noble and royal-like. My husband chose the hotel, so anyway I respected his choice. My room was cozy, comfortable with great view, especially at sunrise and sunset moment.  The staffs were helpful and pleasant. They guided me a lot about shopping centres, famous landscape and must-visit places. Breakfast here was ok, but I suggested you to go out. There were many fabulous restaurants nearby.",4,2014,04,25
40,Wow and wow!,"Staying here as I write this. Could not be more pleased. Started at check in where they sit you down with a glass of water or cava just because. In the few minutes it took, and after our hostess gave us. Map with points of interest to match our preferences we turned around and our gas had already been taken to our room. Don't worry about losing your key. It's done by fingerprint scanner. No key. 
The room was spacious and warm with hardwood floors and lots of closet space. Shower has a rain shower head and tub has a sliding window to the bedroom. Toilet is in a separate room. Bathrobe, slippers, courtyard view (but soundproofing is ideal). 
Haven't tried the spa yet. Wifi is included.
Location is a quiet street but just 1/2 a block from de Gracia. What a find!",5,2014,04,22
40,Devine minimalism,"They say location, location, location, well this is the right location.  In the heart of it all and yet tucked away so as not to be disturbed.

Very minimalist, which we love.  Great staff, who were knowledgable, polite and professional.

Food was good although we mostly ate out. (see below)

Steam room worked well, although the gym is a bit naff, but don't let that put you off.

Things to do:

Take a short train trip to Sitges, great little town with lots of shops and quaint beaches.

Con Gracia, 10 minute walk from hotel serving devine tasting menu.

Sensi Bistro for some lively tapis (may need a good map to find)

Cera 23, gastro bar serving some no nonsense food.",5,2014,04,22
40,Perfect oasis in an amazing city,First time to Barca and the Alma could not have been better. Discretely placed off the Passeig de Gracia it is idea for jumping on the city tours or hitting the shops. Staff were excellent and the large city garden was a real hidden gem. Rooms nice and quiet and well equipped. A long mirror was the only thing missing. Would definitely go back without hesitation.,5,2014,04,18
40,Amazing hotel in a central location,"The Alma is truly exquisite. It's a real 5 star experience. My wife and I spent a couple of nights here. The night time front desk manager Michael is extremely helpful and friendly and also very fluent in English. We were upgraded on our arrival, and were on the 3rd floor facing the garden. The rooms facing the garden are quieter. We had complementary champagne which was great. My one niggling point was that there aren't an iron in the room, which I have experienced in other hotels. Pressing a shirt costs €12. The breakfast was really well done. Overall, it's the best hotel I've ever stayed in and will definitely return.",5,2014,04,18
40,Wonderful!!!,"We came to the Alma hotel based on Tripadvisor and it was better than we could imagine. Stunning rooms, prime location, helpful staff and the best vacation possible. 
Both the executive suite and the regular room were wonderful, but no doubt that if you have the option take the executive suite... ",5,2014,04,17
40,Excellent hotel,"Well located in the centre of the Barcelona, modern, stylish, comfortable and thoughtfully designed rooms, good bathrooms with oversized shower, charming, helpful and efficient staff. Excellent value.",5,2014,04,15
40,Excellent property,Alma Hotel is in a fabulous location with local tapas bars and a great café just around the corner. The room is beautifully furnished and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The oasis style courtyard and bar area is a great place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of the busy streets.  If I was to make any suggestion at all and only a suggestion not a criticism  it would be to have the option all year around for a lower air-conditioning room temperature. A minimum available of 21C when it is 20C plus outside and still winter duvet's on make for a restless night. Recommend to anyone but especially to couples.,5,2014,04,12
40,Exceeded all of our expectations.,"Very warm and attentive staff. Extremely helpful regarding all travel matters and arrangements. Gorgeous contemporary hotel with top of the line amenities - no exaggeration!
Beautiful outdoor space for sitting/dining. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone who demands a first class experience. ",5,2014,04,09
40,Fantastic,"Immaculate service from all the team, particularly on the front desk, (couple of really good restaurant recommendations)  Room on the garden side was peaceful and quiet, with a beautifully comfortable bed, and a great bathroom. Hotel was centrally located and we would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,04,07
40,"You need to experience this staff.....the bath, on the other hand, is....","There aren't enough words to adequately describe the incredibly personal and attentive service we experienced from the staff at the Alma. Marco, Xavier and a host of others, whose names we didn't capture, were amazing. The Alma is a modern hotel in a great location with one significant shortcoming. The sleeping area is separated from the shower area by a folding screen. No doors. There are moments when a little privacy would be welcome.  

A few enhancements we would recommend are: 1) privacy doors in the bath area 2) a dressing mirror in the main sleeping area 3) a clothing hook in the toilet room 4) a tad more lighting at the check in desk 5) a coffee/tea maker in the room 6) a cover sheet on the bed so one can remove the down comforter if desired.

Give us a door and we would return on our next visit to Barcelona. If the absence of a door doesn't bother you then by all means stay at the Alma.",4,2014,04,06
40,Wonderful hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel with my 16 year old son and we were very happy there.  Wonderfully modern but understated.  Great attention to detail.  The staff were so professional, friendly and helpful.  Our room was beautiful and comfortable.  The food is as good as it gets.  While the breakfast is expensive it was delicious and I racked up my bill by eating there every morning.  A wonderful table of pastries, a table of charcuterie and cheese and bread and a table of fruit, juices and smoothies. A warm breakfast of eggs of your choice is available.  We had room service for dinner a few times because I couldn't drag my son out again and the food was top notch.  The location is ideal.  I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again!",5,2014,04,04
40,Amazing Hotel,"This boutique hotel is as beautiful as it gets. Modern design and super comfortable rooms. Also in a very convenient location to several main attractions. I would definitely stay here again in the future. Oh.. and for the tech geeks out there, you open the doors with your fingerprint. Cool!",5,2014,04,01
40,Beautiful and modern,"Our first time in Barcelona and it started with this hotel.

Modern deco, after a long flight both of us crashed into the very comfy and simple room.  Great nights sleep and great privacy and ambiance.  True boutique hotel feel with modern touches.

40,Amazing Experience!,"The staff were so friendly and helpful.  We had such a lovely weekend away!  I would definitely recommend the Alma Barcelona to anyone travelling to the city.  They gave us amazing recommendations, upgraded our room, and they were always there to answer any questions we had.  What a lovely trip!",5,2014,03,27
40,Room 100% silent & comfortable,"Best place to stay in town. 
Good taste is in every detail. Garden is an oasis, service is outstanding. The only thing is that hairdryer is not the best, if you need to style your hair bring yours. Every other thing is perfect. We love our stay at Alma, and certainly will come back.",5,2014,03,21
40,A 7 star experience.,"From the moment we walked through the Alma Hotel doors until we left 6 days later, we had an unforgettable experience. 

Every single aspect of this hotel is 6-7 star plus. 
Marcos, one of the concierges was absolutely outstanding as was every other member on that team and the front desk. 
We were always made to feel like we were VIP's. 

We had an Executive Suite that was almost a mini apartment in size. The room was beautifully appointed with high quality amenities. 
 
We had dinner in the hotel on two occasions and the quality of the food and service was excellent. 

The spa is also worth a visit with a very calming atmosphere. If you can obtain a massage from Inma, don't pass up on the opportunity. Your body will thank you for it. 

On any future trip back to Barcelona, we wouldn't consider any other hotel. 
",5,2014,03,14
40,Not so fabulous for a Luxury Hotel.,"Base on Trip Advisor high ratings we booked Alma Barcelona. In February I stayed here for 5 nights with my family. We had separate rooms. My family stayed on the 1st floor, while I stayed on the 2nd floor overlooking the inner courtyard.  We were excited to see pictures of the indoor pool. We were looking forward to stay at this hotel. We even used their paid hotel shuttle. After providing all the flight and guests information. I called to followed up. In the email, Alma emphasize: ""We would like to inform you, that the cost of the transfer is 112€ per way, the car would be a Mercedes class ""E"", with an English speaker driver."" <--- That didn't happen of course. He spoke very little English. We were picked up with a Mercedes S class. Which was fine, I didn't ding this rating base on the car. Of course there was plenty more dissatisfied services that made me rate this hotel as Average. Please read on.

When arrived for check-in my first impression of this hotel was WOW so dark. We were greeted quickly by the hotel staffs. We check-in hassle free until we asked information such as the pool hours. Then the staff answered and told us in order to get in the pool they need to scan our fingerprint to open the door. Apparently there's no separate key for the guest and the only way to access the pool is by fingerprint. We scanned our thumbs multiple times until the savvy computer system read our fingerprints. When asked do we want keys for our rooms. We took the traditional method of getting a solid key. Thankfully we made the right choice based on past experience. 

Next I inquired tours and fast train information. The staff said, they can book for us. So we gave them our credit card to book for Renfe Railway. But again they experienced problems with lagging website to down computer system. We gave them several credit cards to tried to buy a pair of Renfe Railway tickets. From check-in to trip booking, it took over an hour and nothing got through. That's before we even got to our rooms. Finally, after countless tries I decided to cancel the process and rather deal with the online purchase myself.

Speaking of which... I praise their innovation of high security level on internet user. Apparently they have a separate login & password for each Wi-Fi device good for 7 days.

Next comes to a non working phone in the room. Thankfully I have google voice on my laptop. I had to use my google voice to called the hotel number to do a ""Room-to-Room"" phone call.  <-- Seriously unbelievable!! 

When reported to the front desk that my room phone was not working. The gentleman repeated that I have to hit the number and dial icon to make the call. Of course I know that, but there was no dial tone. No matter what buttons I pushed. As a guest staying at a Luxury Hotel, I shouldn't have to troubleshoot. 

Not only my room phone wasn't working. When I reached my family at their room. I was told they weren't able to make any calls out. So again, I took out my laptop and connect with google voice.

Apparently, I also learned they experience trouble with the pool door scanner. It wouldn’t read the fingerprint. When complained to the front desk. One of staff kept saying is no hassle for us to open the pool door for the guest. He said, just come to the front desk. Apparently, they don't understand guest perspective! Guest like myself or my family member don't want to go to the front desk with our ropes on ready for the pool. There's no hotel phone beside the pool door. Guest would have to take the elevator up to reach out a hotel staff or go back to their room to make a call to report door issue to the phone desk. <-- Seriously, this proof that modern technology is very inconvenience!!

Also, I’m not a big fan to their open shower. No matter how gentle I shower, the water splashes everywhere on the floor. Why didn’t they put a glass sliding door? I booked this hotel hoping to have a relax vacation. But Alma modern design puts me to work. I had to laid layers of towels on the floor every time after showering. So I won’t slip because puddle of water. 

In terms of clean hospitality, Alma is not clean! I accidently dropped my camera bag on the floor. When I picked up, it was covered in dust. It was a matter of 3 seconds on the floor. How can a luxury hotel be so dirty?!! Dust was visible on the edge of the wall, underneath the TV, in the closet and basically everywhere on the floor. This is so disgusting!!

Food wise at the hotel was acceptable. I enjoyed the breakfast very much especially the salmon bun, cheese and hams. 

Staff are professional, helpful and friendly. 

Rating is base on hotel lack of working high tech devices, cleanliness, food and staff.

Score is base on 5 being the highest. 

High Tech Device - 2
Cleanliness - 1
Food at the Restaurant - 5
Hotel Staff - 4

Alma Barcelona is definitely a 3 stars hotel for me. I do not recommend this hotel.",3,2014,03,05
40,Awesome Stay,"The hotel is located in the Fifth Avenue area of Barcelona....so if you don't have any self control leave your credit card in the room as you will be heavily tempted to shop till you drop.

The rooms are clean and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  It's easy to find cheap meals as well as high end restaurants, and only a 25 minute ride from the airport.

The breakfast buffet is served until 11am so you can lie in and still find plenty of fresh tasty food.

I had the best sleep so far in a hotel - the bedding is comfortable and of high quality, and the ambiance is soothing and calming.

The hotel has a nice spa, equipped with a swimming pool and steam room.  There is also a gym, but please note that as a slightly boutique hotel, don't expect equinox in the basement.

40,Quiet Oasis in Barcelona,Spent 6 days here between Christmas and New Year.  Hotel was beautifully furnished and in a great location.  Breakfast was relaxing and nothing too much trouble for the staff.  Would recommend this to anyone seeking a a little luxury to come back to at the end of a day's sightseeing in this wonderful city.  We made use of the gym facilities (adequate but a little cozy!) and had some great drinks and snacks in the bar at all times of the day! A nice touch was the complimentary minibar and wifi,5,2014,02,27
40,Would return tomorrow!,"Beautiful city, nice people, and to top it up, this beautiful property... We had a wonderful one week stay in Alma hotel. 
Design is impeccable, appropriate for the trendy area of the city, well thought of, not at all at an expense of comfort. ""Grand deluxe"" room we stayed in was on a higher floor and offered nice views on the courtyard and the roof of La Pedrera. Quiet, minimalistic, yet with all the necessary amenities, great sleep quality, free mini bar, good Wi-Fi. Calm atmosphere throughout the hotel, nice change after a whole day in a bustling city.
Location- beautiful neighborhood with good shops, trendy cafes and restaurants, 15 minutes walk to La Rambla, few minutes walk from 2 metro stops, good connections to everything. 
Breakfast is on a expensive side, but well worth it, good choice and quality. If you don't want the whole buffet breakfast, there is a a la carte option as well. Lunch and dinner options are somewhat limited in choice, but great in quality and portion sizes.
Personnel of hotel was genuinely nice, unpretentious but very professional from the first email correspondence until the last minute of our stay. We had some specific requests, and they responded in a way that is expected from a real 5 star hotel. Just be warned, no fake smiles, no empty talk:-))) From people working in the restaurant to the concierge desk service was impeccable.
And yes, if we could, we would return tomorrow:-)",5,2014,02,24

40,"Most wonderful, friendly, calm hotel","I really cannot speak highly enough of the Alma hotel and its staff. I spent a weekend there with my daughter for my birthday. We had a twin room on the first floor. The room was impeccable. Clean, airy, modern and beautifully arranged. The beds were extremely comfy and the bathroom gorgeous. A few people on here complain about there being no door on the bathroom (the toilet is separate BTW) and it really isn't an issue at all as its offset against the main room anyway. 

The position of the hotel was also perfect for us as it was equidistant from Sagrada Fammilia and the old town about 10-15 minutes walk to both. Metros were also very close by, so you can literally get anywhere. We got the train / Metro from El Prat to Diagonal to get to the hotel.

The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful - thank you Alma staff for making my stay and birthday wonderful, you are just the most professional, kind, caring people. 

I loved my stay at the Alma and intend to go back later this year for a longer one.
p.s. the breakfast was extra at 25 euros but the food was fresh and of really high quality, worth every penny",5,2014,02,10
40,Great everything!,Location is good for all sights and about a fifteen minute walk from Las Ramblas. Plenty of food options all around but the hotel food is very good if pricey. Rooms are trendy and modern and the ones out the back overlook the garden. The only slight mark on a great stay is that the car park is public and a five minute walk - not great if you are travelling by car with lots of luggage (but at least the car park is secure and a valet is on hand to take it there or bring it back). Would definitely go again. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.,5,2014,02,06
40,"EXCELLENT HOTEL, EXCELLENT STAFF, EXCELLENT LOCATION","We stayed at this hotel over the new year, very contemporary styled, not much lighting in the bedroom, but never the less it was not a big thing, superb shower, we ate in the restaurant on new years eve, very reasonable priced, food was delightful, and then a midnight glass of champagne in one of the hotels boardroom watching celebrations from all over Spain in their large flat screen tv just perfect. All staff members that we met were brilliant, and the recommendation to eat the best paella in Barcelona on the outskirts of Barcelona was spot on. The hotel is located in a fantastic position, all in all we had a pleasant experience at this hotel and we will be back, thank you to everyone.",5,2014,02,04
40,Looking forward to going back,"I stayed at the Alma last year during MWC and booked early to ensure I could stay again this year.  The staff was amazing (everyone knew my name!), the rooms were trendy, modern European yet spacious, and  the location is at the heart of Barcelona. I also loved the thumbprint access to your rooms so you don't have to worry about room keys.  I'm looking forward to my visit back in three weeks.",5,2014,02,02
40,Loved our stay at the Alma Barcelona,"This hotel is perfectly located. The staff were always friendly and helpful and the concierge always found us excellent restaurants to dine at which were frequented by the local people of Barcelona.
The breakfast in the hotel was perfect with great service and everything ordered was very tasty.
Our room was a Grand Deluxe room which was perfect in every aspect. The style of the hotel is modern and eclectic. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,01,27
40,Wonderful 3 day stay!!,"We chose this hotel based strictly on Trip Advisor reviews and stayed there for the 3 days prior to our Disney Mediterranean cruise.  The hotel met and surpassed all of our expectations!  We arrived early in the morning, before 9AM local time, after an overnight flight from the US.  We were able to check right in which was great as we were exhausted for our flight. Our taxi was met right out front and bags were held and then promptly taken up to our room.  Check in was quick and efficient and we were given a map of the city which we found very helpful.  Everyone we encountered (housekeeping, restaurant staff, front desk/concierge) spoke sufficient English to assist with our ""No habla espanol""!  The room was great.  We had what they referenced as the Executive Suite and it was very spacious with a separate sitting area located on the other side of a room break formed by the large armoire that housed the 2 TV's, mini fridge and drawers for storage.  As I assume is a European thing, the mini fridge was stocked with water, juices and soda which was wonderful.  The beds were very comfortable and although the floors were hardwood and kind of chilly the provided slippers (and robes too) helped with that.  The bath was very large with a wonderful tub, separate shower and double sinks.  The towels were very plush.  The toilet and bidet were enclosed which offered some privacy.  The only complaint I might have about the room would be it was a little ""dark"" even with all lamps burning.  But that was not really a huge issue to us as the bathroom was very well lit.  We did have breakfast and dinner both at the hotel and enjoyed both.  We had never been to Spain so we were unsure what to expect but were pleased with both meals and the price seemed comparable to other restaurants we visited while in the city.  I would term breakfast as a buffet with multiple stations with both cold and warm items as well as juices.  It was a little pricy but we enjoyed it as well as the convenience of it.  Dinner was ala carte and enjoyable.  At both meals they were not very busy and it seemed that maybe the staff was a little overwhelmed as only one server was handling everything but it could have just been the difference in European vs. American.  The hotel is very centrally located to the main thoroughfare of the city with stops for the hop on/hop off tourist buses very close by.  It is within walking distance of the Placa de Catalunya and there are many stores, restaurants and attractions in the area.  The front desk/concierge staff were very helpful with questions about the area and things to do.  Check out was again very efficient and they had a taxi ready and waiting by the time we had settled our bill to take us to the cruise ship terminal.  I was very pleased with our stay and although not much of a European traveler I felt that we got what we paid for as far as quality and service.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Barcelona area!!",5,2014,01,23
40,"Top Notch Service in Convenient, Upscale Location","My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Alma Barcelona in the first week of June, 2013.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in a quiet, classy, upscale neighborhood, only a short walk or Metro ride to many of the most popular sights, but away from the tourist crowds on La Rambla.  There were many positives about Alma, most of which have been mentioned in previous reviews:
•	Friendly, Sincere Service – the Alma staff are warm, friendly, and sincere.  From the moment you are offered water or free Cava at check-in to the moment they call you a cab upon departure, each staff member we had contact with did all they could do to make our stay an enjoyable one, and made you feel welcome.  The front desk staff patiently answered my many questions, and assisted with booking tickets to sites and tours, without making you feel rushed or as if they were being bothered.
•	Convenient, Upscale Neighborhood – The Alma is located a block from La Passage de Gracia, an upscale shopping and restaurant neighborhood.  The hotel is only a block from Gaudi’s famous Casa Mila, a few blocks from the Block of Discord, and about a 10 minute walk to Sagrada Familia.  The hotel is only a couple blocks from two metro stations on the L3 (green) line – Passeig de Gracia at the Block of Discord, and Diagonal near Gaudi’s Casa Mila.  The neighborhood is quiet, feels very safe, and is far less crowded with tourists than we found in the Barri Gottic (Gothic Quarter) and on La Rambla. There are several nearby breakfast cafes and restaurants for lunch or dinner.  
•	Beautiful clean, modern rooms and property – we really enjoyed using the fingerprint keycard as opposed to digging around or worrying about losing our keys.  The rooms are modern, very clean, with huge showers and quartz sinks (see pics).  The toilet is in a separate closet.  The blinds block out all noise and light, the beds are very comfortable, and slippers and robes are provided.  Our room (Room 605) looked out over the courtyard and Casa Mila’s rooftop (see pics).  
•	Free minibar – the mini bar offered complimentary water, beer and juices, and ours was re-stocked each day.   
•	Peaceful interior courtyard – we enjoyed a drink at night in the quiet, interior tree-filled courtyard (see pics).  Based on the above, I would give the Alma a 5 star rating and highly recommend this hotel.  However, there were a few minor issues that caused me to rate the hotel 4 stars.
o	Dim lighting - The rooms and hallway are not well-lit.  That didn’t bother me, as I felt it added to the luxurious, modern feel.  However, my wife found it difficult to apply her makeup at the bathroom sink with the available light. 
o	Lack of Privacy When Showering - the bed is separated from the sink and glass-door shower by a partition that runs only to the end of the bed.  If you are traveling with someone and want privacy while showering, your roommate would need to stay on the other side of the partition or leave the room.  Also, if you are showering in the morning, you have to turn on a light to shower, which would likely wake light sleepers.
o	Breakfast is not included.
o	There is no drawer space for your clothes. 
o	No coffee maker in the room - I think this is typical of many hotels in Spain and Europe.  You had to order room service or buy a cup of coffee in the breakfast area in the lobby.  There are a few breakfast cafes and a Starbuck’s within 2-3 blocks of the hotel, but I think in a hotel this nice the management should provide a small coffee maker in each room. 
•	Tips: 
o	Go to Sagrada Familia around 1:30 or later to avoid crowds, and buy tickets in advance from your hotel or ATMs at many La Caixa bank branches. 
o	Take a 2 hour walking tour of the Gothic Quarter.  One of the most enjoyable and interesting things we did in Barcelona was learning the history of the city in this interesting tour.  Buy your tickets at the T1 at the Placa de Sant Jaume.  Our tour started at 9:30 a.m., but the times may vary depending on the time of the year.  
o	Avoid La Rambla until the end of your stay in Barcelona, and walk it either early morning or later in the evening.  The street is very touristy, crowded from the cruise ship passengers, and can be claustrophobic.  If this is the first area you explore in Barcelona, you may miss other sites and have an unfair and incomplete view of Barcelona.
o	Take the Metro.  The Metro is easy to figure out, efficient, cheap and can save you much time walking long distances between the different parts of the city.  The T10 Card is a great deal, about 8.25 Euros for 10 rides.  It is shareable, good on all Metro and local bus lines, as well as the RENFE train lines (including rides to the airport and train station).  Cabs are also very affordable.
o	Visit Monsterrat if you have a third day in Barcelona.  It is well worth the day it takes to visit this monastery in the mountains an hour and a half north of Barcelona.  If you do visit, to avoid what can be huge crowds - both on the train ride to the monastery and at the monastery, go as early as possible, or plan to arrive there around 2:00 p.m., when the crowds subside.  We made the mistake of leaving from Barcelona’s Placa d’Espanya around 10:00 a.m.   The train ride to Monsterrat was so full we had to stand, packed in like sardines, the entire hour and a half train ride.  
o	If you visit Park Guell, do so late in the afternoon around two hours before it closes, when the crowds disappear.  To save a long walk uphill from the bus or Metro station, I recommend taking a cab that drops you off right at the main entrance for around 8 Euros from the city center.",5,2014,01,22
40,Loved the locale,"First,  the service was outstanding. The front desk was great. Everyone seemed very happy to accommodate us, helping with directions and reservations, and exchanging out some big bills for smaller ones. 
  Location wise we loved being so close to so many stores and restaurants and we were happy to be able to easily walk to so many sites. 
  Room was spacious, especially for Europe. Bed was comfy, blackout shades were great, we faced the street but had no problem with noise. We took advantage of the free mini bar, it was nice to have a bottle of water at night.
 Hotel was clean and well decorated. But as others have said it was pretty dark.  No shower curtain and no tub is strange considering there was plenty of room. No way we would have breakfast there for the price. It didn't look worth it.",4,2014,01,12
40,very nice location,"This is a really nice boutique hotel, elegantly designed. Staff was very helpful and warm. The location of the hotel is amazing, walking distance to very nice restaurants. Rooms are very modern ,  comfortable and clean. I would stay here again if I visit Barcelona once more",4,2014,01,09
40,In the heart of Barcelona walking distance to many attractions,"A very nice, quiet and elegant hotel. It is located in walking distance to many of the attractions of Barcelona (Gaudi etc) A relatively high price but worth it. We found that the front desk people went out of their way to help us in any way and fashion, advising about good and bad restaurants and easy ways to walk to La sacrada Famiglia.",5,2014,01,07
40,"Outstanding service, romantic hotel","We stayed twice at the Alma Barcelona over Christmas/New Years 2013, 3 nights each time, on the front and back ends of our trip. Can't say enough about the quality of the service from the warm, solicitous staff (special kudos to Saray who was impeccable in her follow-though, lining up hard to get reservations at wonderful restaurants and clubs). The facility is beautiful and spotless, the rooms are spacious and well-appointed. There's a quiet, pretty back courtyard area which is nice for an outside drink. Awesome location, just steps off a major shopping street (Passeig de Gracia) and close to Gaudi sites like La Pedrara. Casa Battilo and La Sagrada Familia. We highly recommend this property and Alma's beautiful and historic Hotel Palacio Villapanes in Seville.",5,2014,01,04
40,deserving of its 5 stars,"we stayed at the alma for 4 days and have very little, if anything, to complain about. we opted for the grand deluxe suite and the room was very modern and had all the amenities you'd expect from a hotel like this (including malin + goetz amenities). Location was fantastic - right in the heart of the new city so great for shopping and your fix off gaudi, and just a short taxi to other popular areas. we ate in the hotel twice - once for a quick lunch and once for dinner when we were too tired to go out. the food was very good (not great, but good), but both times the restaurant was practically empty which was slightly depressing. finally, the service was fantastic - they helped us order tickets to museums, made dinner reservations for us, etc. Only word of caution - if you ask for restaurant recos, don't let them send you to Restaurant Tuset. It was the worst meal of our trip...",4,2014,01,03
40,Superior Service,"I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel.  The staff is friendly, helpful, attentive, resourceful, and each person went out of their way to ensure that we had the best possible vacation.  Special kudos to Javier, Angeles, Mariella, Marcos, Gabriella - and truly everyone - you all treated us like royalty.  Individualized attention every single day - helping us with tickets, ideas, restaurant reservations, and on and on.  We couldn't have asked for better.  THANK YOU!",5,2014,01,01
40,A highlight of Barcelona,"We stayed at Alma for my Father's birthday and therefore needed somewhere suitable for a group with an age range of 7 to 70. Alma did not disappoint! 

Our welcome was the best of any hotel I had ever stayed in in Europe. Complimentary drinks, effortless service, fingerprint software instead of keys and a warm Catalan smile. 

The rooms we had were Exec and Deluxe rooms, all perfect for our needs. The exec suites at the front of the hotel were larger and accommodated three people. The suite was stunning, with luxury Bulgari products and original details. The n,y down side, would be the slight noise from the busy street outside, but this was only a minor point.  

The bar was a great place for drinks before and after nights out, with great service and stunning decor. 

We didn't eat at the hotel, but local cafes, such as Emma's had a great choice at a reasonable price. 

The location of Alma is excellent, right in the heart of the shopping district and close to lots of superb restaurants. 

The highlight of the hotel was its overall design and it's staff. Each one exceptional in their own way, and the concierge's recommendations we're spot on! Thank you Alma. We will be back!",5,2013,12,17
40,Great location and a great place to stay for our 15th wedding anniversary,"My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of November.  We were visiting Barcelona as a special 15th wedding anniversary trip.  The location of the hotel cannot be beat - it is within walking distance to pretty much anything that you would want to see in Barcelona.  It is also located very close (about 2 blocks) from a very nice Metro stop.  From the time that we checked into the hotel until we left, the service was fantastic.  Our room was on the courtyard side of the hotel and was very, very quiet - we never heard any street noise.  In fact, if we had not seen the cleaning crew cleaning other rooms on our floor, we would have thought we were the only ones on our floor.  The front desk clerks helped us get some FC Barcelona tickets online and were very friendly.  As with any hotel, don't ask them for restaurant recommendations - do your own research on TripAdvisor.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2013,12,17
40,Underwhelmed and disappointed,"We booked the Alma after extensive TripAdvisor research and the glowing reviews that were written about this property- especially about the high level of service. This was a very special 10 year anniversary trip, so we wanted to make sure that the hotel was not only luxurious, but also warm and friendly in a personalized manner. We were extremely disappointed. The woman checking us in was in no way friendly and made not effort to do anything special in terms of upgrades, etc for our special occasion. The deluxe room that we had paid extra for reminded me of a dorm room. It was very stark with a tiny bathroom and marks on the walls. When I asked to be moved, they showed me another room on the 6th floor that was even worse as it had a half wall separating the bedroom/bathroom and there was no bathtub. Finally I asked them to show me a suite, which while not wonderful was definitely a nicer setting and more spacious. We did not want the room to ruin our trip, but the manager refused to upgrade us and we had to pay the extra 60 euro on top of the already very high price we had splurged on. I did not want to waste time arguing, so we ended up letting our travel agent deal with management since obviously they did not have the standards that we were used to in terms of customer service for 5 star properties. While the suite was much better, it overlooked a busy street and right into an office building where we could see business meetings conducted late into the evening- not very romantic. The beds were very comfortable, but the lighting was so dark that I couldn't find things in my suitcase in the evening and there were no drawers to lay things out. The location was nice, near all of the high end shops but still quite a walk to Las Ramblas and the Barri Gothic where we preferred to go in the evenings- definitely more ambiance in these areas and el Born. There were limited local and good restaurants closeby- they were mostly overpriced and quite touristy. We did have a great meal at Tapas 24 (go very early to get a seat) and an amazing neighborhood meal at Maramassa (we still talk about the Gambas and Garbanzos!!). The breakfast at the hotel was delicious, but again the service was not very warm and we saw mostly business travelers rather than couples. We had one incident where one of the young men at reception helped my husband print out our Sagrada Familia tickets at a nearby ATM, offering to walk down there with him- but this was the only incident that gave us a glimpse into the service that was being referred to in the reviews. Otherwise, we found the front desk and other employees there to be unfriendly and even while greeting us at the door- there was no smile, it seemed forced and businesslike. I would by no means say this was a 5 star property, nor would I recommend this property for couples. I think it would work well as a business hotel only. When we were checking out the man asked how everything was and when I said ""alright""- he did not even inquire. By the way there was never any mention of our anniversary during our entire stay- no card, nothing even though I am certain our travel agent told them!!! We have traveled extensively to luxury properties and a good hotel would have done something.  The only saving grace was that we moved to the Hotel Arts for the last two night of our stay in Barcelona and were finally given the wonderful and warm service that we had hoped for. See my review for this property. Not sure how this hotel received its top ranking on TA- opt for the Hotel Majestic or Mandarin Oriental close by if you want to stay in this area. If you don't mind being a little less central but in a true 5 star property- go to Hotel Arts!",3,2013,12,16
40,Pretentious,"Pros: Good location. 5 minute walk to casa batllo, shopping and hop on off bus tours. Nice bath products. 

Cons: Room very dark and basic. Front desk staff not friendly and unhelpful. No door for the shower for privacy. 

Not deserving of a 5 star status. It's a 3 star hotel with a good location. Definitely not a good value and not worth the price.",3,2013,12,14
40,Best location and service,"Hotel location was the best close to shopping and restaurants , the staff were very helpful , I booked the executive suite it was spacious and nice the bathroom was big and well designed . I travel with my two kids and the staff was very friendly with my kids:)",5,2013,12,07
40,Very good boutique hotel,"I stayed 3 nights last november at hotel Alma (room 503).
This is a very charming boutique hotel with a sober contemporary design. The location is great : off North of Pacio de Gracian, close to the Diagonal avenue. The hotel is basically located very close to luxury shops (Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, ...).
The staff is very welcoming, friendly and helpful. You are greeted at the reception with a glass of wine if you are thirsty.
You are also proposed to choose between a key card or your finger print to open your room's door : the finger print is really good as you avoid risks of loosing you card and it is amusing, you feel like James Bond ... 
The room was large, comfortable, very quiet even if I was facing the street. The design was contemporary but maybe too sober.
Overall the hotel was really good, the only drawbacks :
The room design was not enough cosy : they should put a carpet in the room to make it more cosy (a simple bed sheet loking like a simple towel was lying on the floor).
The toiletries dispensers were too basic for a hotel of this standard (only soap, shampoo and body lotion).
The fitness center is too small and not very well equipped. The swimming pool is tiny, it is impossible to swim as it is too shallow. 
Price : I think I paid around 270 € per night without breakfast. You can find very good hotels in Barcelona for a lower price.",4,2013,12,01
40,"Brilliant Stay, Fantastic Boutique Hotel!","I loved everything about this hotel.  
Fabulous, knowledgable, well trained, and professional staff (all of them)...
Chic, warm, quiet and beautifully designed common areas...
Chic, high end, LARGE, efficient, quiet, restful, luxurious rooms with wonderful amenities...(stayed in room 510 - sound of silence)
Incredible location...

Loved, Loved, Loved...The Alma!  The perfect boutique hotel in Barcelona.",5,2013,11,28
40,A perfect boutique hotel,"Stayed 3 nights post-cruise and found the Alma the perfect place.  A knowledgeable, attentive staff, a clean, modern and very nicely appointed room overlooking the garden, and a location within 15 minutes walk of almost everything in the city.  You can't ask for more than this in a hotel!",5,2013,11,26
40,Very nice hotel with a great staff,"I switched from the ""W"" to that Alma and it was the best decision possible. The hotel is very nice, the location great and the staff terrific. Our flight arrived early and they even gave us our room by 11AM. I would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2013,11,25
40,Wonderful place,"Wonderful welcome, a refreshing drink, smiling reception staff ready to give advice on attractions, transport and local knowhow. We were upgraded to a spotlessly clean room, bathroom with a double shower cubical and separate toilet. I rang to get a shower cap and in exactly 3 minutes it arrived.The decor was to our liking but may be a bit too minimalist for some. Dark walls , snowy white bed linen and versatile lighting. The beds were extremely comfortable with super soft pillows. 
Everything about the hotel was understated yet of the highest quality. The breakfasts comprised freshly juiced oranges, superb coffee, a selection of rolls, croissants, pastries, cakes, breads, meats, cheeses, dates,figs,strawberries melon etc as well as a hot selection.
 Close to the Gaudi houses and Tapas restaurants as well as major shopping outlets. 
Will go back.",5,2013,11,25
40,Great location and value,"Stayed for just one night in October ahead of a cruise ship departure. Wanted a central location and good quality. Achieved both. Reception at check in was excellent. Room was spacious, modern and clean. Good facilities. Basic minibar included. Located in relatively quiet side street close to chic shopping and Gaudi properties and 15mins walk to La Rambla. Booked well in advance to maximise discount - so great value (we paid EUR209 - not including breakfast). Would definitely stay again and recommend.",5,2013,11,24
40,Fantastic boutique hotel in a great location,"The Alma Hotel is a fantastic boutique hotel, ideally located in close proximity to some of Barcelona's famous sites (e.g. Casa Battlo, Familia Sagrada) and the high end shopping area of Passeig de Gracia yet in quiet surroundings away from more touristy areas, which makes it an ideal location for a short weekend. It features a modern design which some might find perhaps too minimalist (and sombre) but instead it came across as trendy, clean and functional. We were provided a large room overlooking the courtyard which was very modern and comfortable (the bedding in particular made for a great night's sleep). And no need for a key or even a keycard here as rooms offer the benefit of finger print access - a novel feature! While breakfast/brunch spots are abundant across town, we did end up trying the hotel's breakfast on one occasion which proved a good choice as the hotel offered an extensive range of great quality breakfast foods from a large buffet. The staff were very helpful from the moment of arrival through to our departure and put forward good restaurant recommendations when requested. Overall, the Alma made for a great and comfortable stay for a short weekend. The only criticism to be made is that the staff do not provide an iron and ironing table, even on request, which only leaves you with the option of laundry service if you simply wanted to give a garment a quick iron...",5,2013,11,24
40,Beautiful hotel and perfect location for leisure travelers,The hotel is facing the back of Casa Mila. We were on the top floor with nice view to the rooftop of Casa Mila. The room is decorated tastefully. The bed is comfortable with high quality bed-sheet & pillows. Staffs are helpful and act professional when we complain the wifi connection in our room. They offered to switch to other room on different floor to resolve the wifi issue. It was unfortunate that all rooms are the same. We did not try their breakfast nor their restaurant. The location is central to all major tourist attractions with minimal walking. Our experience in this hotel could be perfect if they provide better wifi connection.,4,2013,11,19
40,Beautiful modern hotel,"Fantastic hotel. Very cool design. Service was excellent. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly, made bookings for us, recommended nearby restaurants helped us with planning our siteseeing. They were very enthusiastic about Barcelona and it made for a lovely stay. The restaurant and room service also excellent.",5,2013,11,18
40,Away from 5 star - Luxury and Hospitality,"Stayed in November for one night and had so much work do to by emails so wanted to pay more and stay in a 5 star hotel assuming that I will have Wi-Fi in my room and can work quietly. Unfortunately 3rd floor wi-fi was not working and despite several reminders to Front Office staff , they did not do anything to fix it. Overall Hotel has a great location and that is what it makes it a target to choose. The restaurant was very quiet and had to eat alone where there was only another table inside. The vegetable tempura was delicious but fish served with rice was not accommodating my taste. Overall It is a dark hotel with minimum daylight coming in from the windows and balcony was looking to a some sort of back garden of other buildings. If they call this Life Style > let it be. The bed was comfortable and shower area was very clean and large. 
At check out, I reminded cashier that I was upset with not having Wi-Fi in the room which ruined all my plans. He told me "" THANK YOU - THIS IS HOW WE WILL IMPROVE"" yes I agree with him but why I should pay for their improvement if they sell a product that is not inline with what was promised to me while I made reservation. 
Not fair !!!",3,2013,11,17
40,barcelona! the Alma!  a great property to stay in the best city in Europe,"The Alma was THE place to stay for us on our current trip to Barcelona!  the quality of service and kindness was unmatched !  while the rooms and property are somewhat understated, the feel of the place was comfortable, welcoming, and just relaxing.  a Very reasonable room rate was not bad, either!!!  each staff member, from front desk, to bar attendants made us feel more like family rather than visitors.  and the concierge services were unlike any we have had in recent trips to Europe!",5,2013,11,13
40,Fantastic,"We stayed here for 2 nights in October and couldn't have been been treated better. The experience started with a glass of cava at check in and a finger print option for opening your room. The rooms were very quiet and had a peaceful grey toned theme. It is modern but had a rather zen like feel which is wonderful after a day of city life. Terrific location, would return in a heartbeat!",5,2013,11,10
40,very nice hotel,"The staff were extremely helpful to us.  The check in experience was very, very good.  The hotel is very pretty but if you don't like modern properties you might find this hotel a little spartan for your taste.  Being fans of modern, contemporary styles, we liked it very much!  And the location is PERFECT for anything you care to see in Barcelona",4,2013,11,07
40,"Did not live up to expectations. Nice, but not 5 star.","I booked this hotel through Expedia for 2 nights. We got a fair price for what was supposed to be a 5 star hotel. The exterior is so ""understated"" that we often had difficulty finding it when we returned after sightseeing!
We checked in at 10:00 a.m. after a long flight from the states. We were exhausted and were told that could not get into our room until 2:00, regular check in time. Fair enough, I suppose. I was able to find a loung chair on the patio where I napped until then.
The interior is very modern and sparse. Also very dark. the floors were a dark, laminate which seemed cheap to me. The walls were dark gray, with black accents. 
The front desk people were young and friendly; although, they could not help us on recommending a restaurant in the near vicinity.
Our room was fine. Again, very sparse, dark, and minimally furnished. The whole atmosphere, to me, was of pretension with no real luxury or accoutrements. They did offer a ""free"" minibar bar, with colas, juice, and, I believe beer. 
At the end of our stay, our bill was a good bit higher than quoted by Expedia. I believe that the difference was an approximate 50€ vat tax per night, of which we had not been advised of earlier either by Expedia, nor the hotel. This made the hotel not such a good deal, at all!
The location of the hotel is very central and convenient. The bedding was comfortable.
They had a bar and patio which were fine. Nothing special. We did have lunch at the bar one day and paid 27€ (over $37 pp for a small plate and a glas of cava).",3,2013,11,07
40,Very good stay,"Great stay at the Alma. Friendly staff and we were given a room straight away even before normal check in time. Room had a great view of the Casa Mila rooftop.

The light switch took a while to get used to and the pillow a little too soft an the tv signal fuzzy at times. Other than that nothing to complain. Hotel location was superb.",4,2013,11,07
40,A boutique hotel that doesn't quite have all the details right,"This is a lovely hotel with beautiful furnishings. The service, however, still is a bit uneven and doesn't warrant the price. The food was OK but again, didn't warrant the price. The staff were highly variable - some super competent and very friendly; the others were vague, snooty and perfunctory. One morning reception person was downright unfriendly - I think she felt being pretty was sufficient. The rooms were well appointed but not having a door on the bathroom was awkward as I was traveling with a family member. They might think about sliding doors. Also, we had a kettle and teacups the first day and then inexplicably they were gone that afternoon - rather disturbingly, while we had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. Finally, we had some weird confusion about our bill - we had been told as we'd checked in that our breakfast was included. It turned out they weren't - at 50 Euros a pop. Might have been useful to understand that before we cheerfully turned up for breakfast every morning. All a bit misleading because there's a little card left in the rooms requesting a ""reservation"" time for breakfast and then a distinction is made between in-room service (25 Euros per person) vs. downstairs in the lobby (no price). Something the management may want to clarify  . . .",4,2013,11,06
40,Great Style and Service,"A one night stay; very good. Great style with charming and attentive service from the front desk. Spa good but small with good massage service. Excellent beds. Super location.
Minor niggles:
- Ultra modern design with hard floors throughout meant that we were kept awake early in the morning with someone above or next door walking around, presumably in high heeled shoes!
- Open rain shower in the bathroom was enjoyable to use, but meant that the floor in the bathroom by the wash basin was all totally wet.
Cafe Emma nearby, recommended by one of your earlier reviewers, was first class for breakfast.",4,2013,11,06
40,too hip,"we just stayed at the Alma Barcelona for 5 nights. The positive: clean and large rooms, friendly, attractive and helpful staff, well-located. The negative: DARK. The lack of lighting made me very uncomfortable. I felt I could not see in the room or in the reception area. I like having more amenities like a tea kettle or coffee pot in the room, apples at the desk, snacks served at cocktail hour. For $250 euros per night, one might expect a few extras.  Too sleek, too cool, too hip for this babyboomer.",3,2013,11,04
40,Wonderful hotel!,"The best things about this hotel:
1. friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable staff.  Everyone we encountered did their best to make our stay pleasant and we really appreciated the help with booking tickets for the major Gaudi sights
2. location - close to main sights and within easy walking distance of La Rambas, but also surprisingly quiet.
3. very comfortable bed with good quality linen
4. excellent bathroom with lovely toiletries and good lighting
5. rooms were serviced twice a day and standards really very high
6. free mini-bar with soft drinks and beer - very welcome

If we had a suggestion for improvement:
More lighting in the bedroom and sitting area - by the fifth day the dark colours and lack of lighting, particularly on cloudy days, began to be a little depressing.  

And our one disappointment:
we had looked forward to spending time on the roof terrace - it was one of the selling points for us when booking this hotel - but it is only open in the summer.  Also there was noisy building work taking place in a building which backs on to the garden - which removed this as an alternative for relaxing out of doors too.",5,2013,11,04
40,"Lovely hotel, outstanding staff, great location","We spent three nights at the Alma. Perfect location a few blocks south of the Diagonal within walking distance to the metro and many major sights (Sagrada Familia, upscale shopping, great restaurants,  Rambla, Born). All of the young staff were very professional and polished. 

Our first night was a little rough as there was a family with small children in the next room who woke us several times with screams and shrieks. Albert was so helpful upgrading us to a larger room on a quiet floor for the next two nights. We would would definitely pay for the upgrade next time as it was a HUGE room (with a sitting area) and a HUGE bathroom (with double sinks, water closet, tub and shower). There were two TVs although we never turned them on. The lighting was great in the bathroom (something that is often lacking in hotels everywhere these days), linens and towels of great quality, wonderful Bulgari toiletries (I don't usually notice toiletries). The free (!) mini bar was restocked with water, soda and beer was restocked each day. Our only complaint was that the free WiFi was pretty slow and spotty.",5,2013,11,03
40,Lives up to its TA reputation,"We stayed at Alma Barcelona for several nights and loved it.  It is well-located (especially if you are exploring the main Gaudi sites), quiet, elegant, and has impeccable service. Beginning with the stunning polar bear painting in the calm, gray-toned reception area to the turn-down service, all was great. The outdoor dining / lounge area was just right on several mornings and evenings.  (Don't order a martini, however.) The pool and sauna were definitely worth a visit, too.  My only tiny complaints are two: the wireless was less than reliable, and one morning on the terrace no one ever asked us if we wanted coffee or anything else.",5,2013,10,31
40,Alma Hotel Barcelona Spain,"In all the travels in the U.S.A and europe, this hotel is one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed.
Locations is outstanding.
Just off the main streets and yet quiet and serene.
Modern, clean and the people extremely helpful where to eat and directions.
I would give them 6 ****** stars.
It is somewhat pricey, but worth it.
John",5,2013,10,31
40,"nice modern hotel with large rooms,  but not worth the price","Based on TA reviews,  we stayed for 5 nights recently at the Alma hotel during our visit to Barcelona.

What I liked about the hotel were the following:

* the rooms were quite large as were the bathrooms which were quite luxurious,

*  the hotel is very modern in its lighting,  colour schemes and decor,  and

*  the hotel has a huge courtyard which is a tranquil and soothing oasis in the middle of the city  -  a good place to sit,  day or night.

What I was disappointed by were:

*  breakfast was not included in the rate.  While I knew this when booking the hotel,  in retrospect,  paying 360 euros per night shouldn't require another 25 euros per person for breakfast,

*  the spa and fitness centre are located under the building and are very closed in,  humid and unpleasant.  The fitness centre was poorly equipped,  and 

*  the hotel does not provide irons or ironing boards.  I have never experienced this situation before!  Most 5 star (and even 2 star for that matter) either provide an iron in the room,  or one that can be brought up by room service.  Instead,  the Alma provides a service where shirts can be pressed for a charge of 6 euros each which I consider to be outrageous for something I can and want to do for myself.  Given that I was attending a conference,  I required pressed business shirts daily.  The evening staff who pointed this policy out to me explained that there was a concern about irons being a fire hazard.  
I spoke with the front desk staff the following morning explaining my situation and that I was considering moving to another hotel.  Given that I was staying in an executive room and I was booked for 5 nights,  they then offerred to have my shirts pressed free of charge.  While this gesture was appreciated,  unfortunately I had already incurred significant stress in the process having scoured the internet for laundrettes in Barcelona (which also don't have ironing facilities) as well as considering buying an iron.

All in all,  the stay was pleasant,  but I would not recommend this hotel.  I dont think it is good value for money,  and its policy on ironing is simply extraordinary.",3,2013,10,29
40,"Great hotel , Great location","A 60th birthday treat for my sister in law - the perfect place - Most of the Guadi within 10 min walk
The rooms ( superior booked ) were large, clean and cool - My wife felt the dark interior a little drap - but I just found it attractive and understated.
The bathroom has a separate large shower and the sitting area a and sleeping area a TV each.
The wifi is free as is the spa - a steam room, sauna and relaxing pool ( about 3 foot deep )
My only critiscism is that I feel that at about £1000 for 4 days - the breakfast should be included - its 24 euro per head!! - Many hotels do this - but I just feel my good will dropping a notch every time I sign off for this.
Staff friendly and very helpful recommended an excellent tapas place nearby.
Overall great hotel, great location - would certainly go back next time I'm in Barcelona",5,2013,10,29
40,Übercool without soul,"The Alma hotel is close to Casa Mila and other Gaudi attractions and it is around the corner of the best designer shops in Barcelona at Passeig de Gracia. Accordingly, the design is chic, hip and cool. However, the muted colour combinations felt almost soulless.

The high point of the hotel are the rooms. Spacious with comfortable beds and with a great shower, opened with a fingerprint scanner. Wonderful that one doesn't have to think about the key.

The staff was helpful and lovely except the staff at the check-in. Too cool for their own good. The map provided by the Alma hotel is also more stylish than useful. Get one from the tourist office.

Overall a mixed experience.",3,2013,10,29
40,"Great hotel, but maybe a little too hip?","We are a couple in our 70's.  We decided to stay at the Alma Barcelona in October, 2013, because of its location in Madrid and the positive reviews it had received in TripAdvisor and elsewhere.  Overall, we were quite happy with our choice.  The location was everything we had expected, the service was excellent, and our room, facing the courtyard, was quiet.

However, some of the features of the hotel were just beyond us.  The preferred way for guests to enter their rooms is via fingerprint (recorded at check-in).  At our age, fingerprints are no longer legible so we had to use a single large room key that needed to be left at the front desk every time we went out.  

Also, we never figured out the light-switch system in our room.  Switches are located just inside the door and others are on a row above the bed.  Some of them turn on a single light and others turn on a group of lights.  Combinations of switch settings in the two locations have unpredictable results.  One night we wanted to turn out all the lights so we could go to sleep, and it was difficult to figure out how to do that.

And inexplicably, there is no place to put things in the bathroom.  Two hooks next to the shower provide a place for bath towels, but there are no hooks for hand towels, bathrobes, or other items, making it necessary to drop these things in the bathtub or let them lie next to the sink, where they invariably get wet.

All in all, the Alma Barcelona scores high in the ""hipness"" factor but not so much in the ""practicality"" dimension.",4,2013,10,28
40,Loved everything about this hotel!,"We booked this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed.  We loved everything about the hotel.
Check in was very easy and after traveling from the US, we very much appreciated this.  We enjoyed a glass of Cava and then went to our room.  We booked a room overlooking the garden.  It was just as pictured on their website.  The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful and well appointed. 
Because we were so tired, we decided to have dinner at the hotel.  I haven’t seen much about the restaurant on TA, but I would give it a 5 rating also.  We ate outside in the garden.  Our waiter was so helpful and obviously proud of the regional food.  Everything we had was delicious and very well prepared.  It was a perfect evening.
After returning to the hotel on another evening, we found a bottle of Cava in our room with a nice note wishing me a Happy Birthday!  We do not recall ever mentioning it was my birthday but somehow they knew; perhaps they noticed when they took my passport.   Everyone at the front desk was so helpful. They gave us some great dining recommendations.  
We just cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay at the Alma Barcelona.",5,2013,10,26
40,Highly recommended!!,"This modern and stylish boutique hotel is located in the heart of the high end shopping area.  So the location is great, between very nice stores, cafes and restaurants.  In addition, its a short walk to major land marks of Barcelona, and the metro station.  
The hotel is clean, modern, stylish, comfortable and sleek.  I like that you can access your room with your finger print, not needing to carry a key or a card.  
Concierge service was AMAZING, ask for Mariella or Satay, they both spent the time and gave us great recommendations for sight seeing, restaurants, cafes, and shopping areas.  Every meal we had was  great because of their recommendations.  Although we are so picky we were very please with all of the recommendations, they were like reading our minds.
The breakfast buffet although not too huge, but very variable, fresh, and ingredients from the region.  The hotel also has a very cute courtyard, its very peaceful and serene, where you can have a meal or enjoy a drink in a hidden garden in the heart of the city.",5,2013,10,25
40,Best. Hotel. Ever.,"Quite honestly, the best city hotel I have ever stayed at in my life.  My husband and I are very well travelled and have stayed at multiple five star hotels and resorts and we can honestly say the service, facilities, food and location of this hotel cannot be beaten.  I wish we could live here!  In the booking process, email responses were quick, friendly and informative.  Upon arrival, our bags were whisked away and we were seated at a stunning reception area and offered sparkling wine while we checked in.  We were provided a brilliant map and restaurant recommendations (try  La Cerveseria Catalana, a five minute walk away and Ciudad Condal, a 15 min walk away.  Also, an amazing restaurant with Spanish/Japanese fusion called Topik was fantastic).  When we saw our room (grand deluxe) we were blown away.  Absolutely beautiful, modern, clean, large and with an amazing view.  The staff at Alma are just fantastic, brilliant attitude, very friendly but also very efficient and knowledgable.  We were so impressed with them all.  Food at the hotel is also outstanding.  We sampled room service which was wonderful , had drinks in the courtyard.  The restaurant has a lovely ambiance to it as well.  We found the food and wine prices very reasonable.  We also tried the spa treatments which were amazing. It is also notable that while we stayed at the hotel, the Grand Prix was on, so the hotel was at full capacity but in all cases the service was outstanding. Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2013,10,24
40,Alma hotel is excellent,"My husband and I thought the Alma hotel deserves a 5 star rating. The location is perfect both for walking ( and public transportation) to restaurants, shopping and Gaudi works the beach, and old city.
The reception area which includes concierge, check in, and bell boy is fantastic. They are very helpful suggesting restaurants that are tasteful, local with top of the line decor. They keep a profile on each guest so they know whst reservations have been made for you during your stay.. The hotel has a beautiful patio in the backyard, which is quiet and retreat like. They serve meals there as well as drinks.",5,2013,10,24
40,High expectations,"Reading the other reviews of this hotel I was expecting a lot. I agree that it's a very good hotel, stylish, comfortable & modern.  The staff are highly professional.  The location is very good - close to some major attractions but quiet enough so that you can have peace & quiet if you want.  

The rooms were good with comfortable beds but didn't quite have the wow factor I was expecting and the breakfast is expensive but you can always eat out I suppose.

I think this really merits a rating of 4.5 but you can't give that so I've rounded up my rating.",5,2013,10,23
40,A great hotel in a superb location,"This relatively new ""boutique""-like hotel is a real find in Barcelona.  Very close to the Gaudi houses and the high-end shopping.  The staff is incredible and the rooftop bar is a ""don't miss"" with incredible views.",5,2013,10,22
40,Great Location,Hotel is in a great location in Barcelona.  The only complaint is how dark the rooms are.  Suggest more light be added as it is hard to see in the rooms when it is dark outside.  Others in our group commented on the same issue.,5,2013,10,22
40,All around great,"Check in was easy with cava, of course;  staff is extremely friendly, helpful and quite knowledgable.  No language barrier - everyone speaks Spanish and English fluently!  The rooms are clean, comfortable with a stocked mini bar, but a little too dark for my liking. 
The location is perfect for all shopping, restaurants and attractions; within walking distance.",4,2013,10,22
40,Excellent hotel,"We book 2 rooms, and everything was perfect. Nice bed, clean, comfortable and great service. Breakfast inside or at the back garden, rooftop terrace with 360 views of Barcelona. Close to stores, close to attractions, Very relaxing and peacefull, with a nice spa. If you are going to Barcelona, stay at this place !!!",5,2013,10,20
40,"Nice people, weird hotel","Rooms are quiet and beds are nice.  Check in was good.  The codes for the Internet did not work because they were old.  Fingerprints for keys also failed.  To get to the front desk, don't use 09 as it says in the hotel guide.  You have to use9.  Do you like the dark places and very low lighting?  This is the place.  I don't get it.  Careful on the steps when you enter the hotel.  Again, the staff could not be nicer, but I cannot recommend this hotel.",3,2013,10,20
40,A wonderful stay,"I just came back from 4 days in Barcelona together with my husband. And what a wonderful stay in the Alma Hotel! A perfect location to visit Garcia as well as the more touristic quarters of El Born and Barri Gothic, with a good choice of restaurants in the neighbourhood.
The staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful. The rooms (we stayed in room 306) are very quiet with a lovely design and the breadfast is fantastic with real expresso coffee! We stayed for dinner the first evening but the choice in the menu was quiet limited. Nevertheless, the food was delicious.
As the hotel price is quite expensive, the service quality needs to be at a very high level. We would only have loved fresh towels when they are wet from an evening shower ;-)",4,2013,10,20
40,City break,"We stayed here for four nights and hotel was excellent.  Nothing is too much for the staff to do for you and they are friendly and approachable.  It is centrally located and all tourist sites are walkable. 

The executive suite we were in was unfortunately on the 1st floor (101) which was right above the entrance to the hotel. This meant constant noise until 2am, difficult when you have to be up at 7am each day. Other than that the bed was comfy and the rainfall shower was lovely. We did asked to be moved but no other rooms were available. so if your a light sleeper avoid this room!

We tried the restaurant and although has a limited menu the food was delicious and reasonably priced. We also tried the breakfast one morning although to be honest your better eating out, overpriced for a continental breakfast. 

One point is not to waste your money on prebooking an airport transfer, we sat in the airport for over an hour when we arrived and they didn't even collect us on our deparature day. Using the local taxis is quicker and cheaper!!!

All in all I would stay here again all be it in a different room. 

",4,2013,10,20
40,Exceptional hotel,"Everything about the hotel was exceptional - large room, very comfortable bed, quiet, great location. Hotel staff provided great service and really enhanced our experience in Barcelona. Would absolutely stay there again.",5,2013,10,19
40,Fantastic.,"The hotel was perfect. Not splashy or ostentatious. Just perfect. We booked an executive suite, and felt like we were in our own home. The bedding was top notch and the room was absolutely serene. If you're looking for a place to call home in Barcelona, this is it. Kudos to the staff as well. Couldn't have been more accommodating. We'll stay again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2013,10,18
40,What every hotel experience should be,"This hotel hits every nail on the head.  Friendly staff, comfortable rooms and clean and modern design.  To top it off, it is in an excellent location.  Highly recommended and would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,15
40,perfect stay,"Everything about our stay at the Alma Hotel in Barcelona was simply perfect. Getting there from Plaça de Catalunya where all Aerobuses stop was easy and fast (an about 10-minute-walk) and the welcome was friendly and warm. Greeted with a glass of sparkling wine and given all the necessary information for our stay, we got to our spacious room on the top floor in less than 15 minutes. 
The room was spotless and nicely furnished (if you like the minimalistic style). The mattress and pillows were of excellent quality and we had a wonderful view of one of the famous Gaudi house rooftops and of mount Tibidabo. 
The food at the restaurant was also really nice and reasonably priced. The garden - although a bit chilly in the evenings for the time of year - looks really relaxing in the middle of this huge city. The rooftop terrace unfortunately closes at the end of September so we never got to see the view from up there. 
Last but not least, the location of the hotel couldn't be any better. Right next to Passeig de Gracia and on Carrer de Mallorca (same street as Sagrada Familia), it's about 15 minutes from most important places and sights (Sagrada Familia, ocean, Ramblas, Barri Gòtic, Picasso museum, Cathedral, Palau de Musica, 2 Gaudi houses right next to it, shopping in front and all around hotel, ...).
So, all in all, well worth the money and a haven of relaxation and quiet while visiting this really fantastic and colorful European city.   

PS: Leaving and getting to the airport by aerobus (Euros 5.90) was very convenient, fast (the trips takes around 30 minutes) and reasonably priced. 
PPS: Get the tickets for the Sagrada Familia online before your visit. The lines of people waiting to get a ticket in front of the basilica are very long. The same goes for most other places of interest.",5,2013,10,15
40,Great modern hotel in excellent location,"In spite of arriving late, we were offered a welcome glass of cava , and our room overlooked the pedrera chimneys. The complementary drinks in the room and turn down service was a nice touch and the bar was reasonably priced. Recommend la tegliatelle over the road for lunch and we found de tapa madre a few blocks away served the bast tapas! The hotel is located off the main shopping street and we walked to most attractions. All in all superb. ",5,2013,10,15
40,Well worth it's high rating.,"A first class experience from start to finish and one which reinforced all of the positive reviews previously posted. The location, service, atmosphere, and the physical feel of the hotel were all of the highest order. I must make particular mention of the concierge/reception service which was exceptional and their helpful and well informed recommendations for trips and cafés/restaurants played a significant part in our enjoyment of our 3 day stay. You could pay a lot less for a more basic hotel  and we thought the breakfast was a tad overpriced but the hotel staff were happy to make recommendations of cheaper local eateries. If there is one thing we would suggest it would be to provide coffee making facilities in the rooms. If you want to have a special stay in a special city then I would thoroughly recommend the Alma.",5,2013,10,14
40,An Absolute Gem,"It isn't obviously a hotel from the outside - and from the moment we crossed the threshold, this establishment continued to surprise us, in the most positive way.  At reception, we were welcomed with a glass of sparkling wine and invited to relax while everything we needed to know about the hotel and places to visit was explained to us in an efficient and friendly manner.  We opted to use the finger-print method to access our room and spa, which was a novelty we hadn't previously encountered.  Our room on the 5th floor was stylishly designed and well equipped (lacking only a shower cap and cotton wool pads - are these no longer routinely provided?), and the bed wonderfully comfortable.  Drinks in the mini-bar (non-alcoholic) were free and replenished daily. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Location was excellent, just a few minutes walk from key attractions and the bustling city, but the hotel itself was an oasis of tranquility.  We ate in the hotel one evening, which was very relaxed. On our second day (my husband's birthday), reception had booked a local restaurant for us, serving Catalan specialities.  When we arrived back in our room, a bottle of champagne and chocolate gateau had been left with birthday greetings from 'the team'. We were bowled over by this unexpected thoughtful gesture. Attention to detail was exceptional in every area and made the ALMA stand out as truly special.  We would recommend it, without hesitation, and hope to return again.",5,2013,10,13
40,Excellent hotel in heart of the city.,"If money is not too important, then this hotel is worth a go. I booked late and could only get a Deluxe Master thingummy (I forget). It was a very large room with lounge area. Whilst almost everything was great, it was not perfect. Eg. the toilet is separate from the bathroom. I know some people actually like that. The massive shower (could squeeze a Hockey Team into it) was great, but so open, that it splashed into the living area (slightly). The wash basin is in the room although screened off. Windows did not open, so you were at the mercy of the A/C, which did work fine. Bed very comfortable, pillows ok. Nice turn down service too. You also get slippers, robes etc.
Breakfast was very good, but squeezing more than half a cup of coffee from the staff was a challenge. Coffee pots do not exist in Barcelona I think.
Staff were helpful and courteous.",4,2013,10,13
40,Absolutely First Class,"Difficult to know how to write this review without writing outstanding or excellent in every line. So here is a shortened version of what I could write a whole chapter on.
Greeting, ambience, décor, room (junior suite room 201 on front of building), bed, shower, towels, robes and sandals, courtyard, staff, all outstanding in every way. An utter joy to stay there, simply superb.
Our room at the front of the building had no road noise at all that we could notice.
I would not hesitate to recommend this wonderful hotel for anybody looking for a few days 'inner peace' in a tranquil location in the centre of a busy and vibrant city.
Thank you, this was Spanish hospitality at its very best from exceptional staff. 
The owners should be extremely proud of what has been created here.",5,2013,10,10
40,Understated Excellence ...,"From the moment we arrived we felt welcome, excellent staff, and in no time had they sorted our our sightseeing programme, and made most of the bookings for us, so we did not have line up to buy tickets.  The suite we had for 3 nights were tastefully equipped and tons of style and good design details, and superb bed and nice linen.   The only think to add is of course that the location is just about perfect.",5,2013,10,08
40,Exceed expectation,"We stayed in the suit for 3 nights and fully enjoyed it. Its central location - 5 minutes walk to the famous Gaudi's La Pedrera and Casa Batllo, attentive, well-informed and helpful service, well trained staff, tasteful design, high quality bedding, toiletries, towels, hangers, sandals and attention to all the small details made our stay a perfect 10/10. It uses finger-print instead of key or card. The interior decoration uses mood lighting intelligently, English international newspapers are available at the lounge, and wifi is hassle free and limitless. Feedback for improvement are: 1) To provide in-room coffee/tea machine in addition to the free drink provided in the refrigerator 2) To establish a restaurant for lunch, dinner and in-room dinning, instead of just breakfast.",5,2013,10,07
40,A shiny gem in the middle of a concrete jungle,"The Alma was one, if not the best hotel we've ever stayed at. This says a lot as we travel quite often. Located steps from the  busy Passeig de Gracia, it was central to Barcelona attractions, but once through the doors, you wouldn't have been able to tell you were in a city centre. Everything here was superb: staff, beds, pillows, spa. I am recommending this to anyone who is planning a stay in Barcelona.",5,2013,10,05
40,Few hotels have it all,"Some hotels have great location. Some great design and comfort, some great staff. The Alma had them all. When we arrived late Saturday night we sat as the receptionist/concierge checked us in, after placing a chilled glass of cava in our hands. Despite being perfectly placed in Barcelona, 20 mins walk from la rambla, or sagrada and right in the heart of the city, when we stepped in the hotel was an oasis of calm. The beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Unusually we decided to try the Hotels restaurant, despite being in the city centre, simply because the quiet courtyard setting was so peaceful. The food was superb and reasonably priced. 

I said receptionist/concierge as that was what the staff were. Booking tickets and restaurants. We had been advised to book our sagrada tickets online and collect from one of the nearby multi task cash machines. When it didn't work for me the receptionist left the desk and walked off with me to the nearest local machine to see if she could sort it out for me. She did. On the last day we flew out late in the evening and so spent the day in the city then the afternoon back in the hotel in the spa in the basement. Sauna and steam room and pool.

Every member of staff couldn't have been more helpful. The decor was contemporary chic and when you stepped from the busy chaos of Barcelona centre, it was like stepping into an oasis of relaxation. We will definitely be going back. This is the perfect hotel for a visit to Barcelona.",5,2013,10,04
40,Pure Perfection!!!,"I have nothing but positivity to say about this hotel. From the staff, to the rooms, to the spa, to the location, to every single detail surrounding this hotel...nothing less than perfection! All staff members went above and beyond whenever questions were posed regarding what to do/ see in the surrounding areas. The location was absolutely perfect since you're on the same street as many restaurants and tons of shopping. The BEST thing I would have to say about this hotel though was hands down THE BED!!! I've traveled across the country and this was by far the best hotel bed I've stayed in. You won't be disappointed if you choose this hotel. I wouldn't stay anywhere else :-)",5,2013,10,03
40,"Great location, great service with a few amenities lacking","The location of the hotel WAS very convenient, the staff was helpful with restaurant recommendations.  The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable.  Having WiFi was great but if we were not in the room, the electricity was turned off and our electronics were not charged.  Confusing to navigate.  For newcomers, it would be nice to have breakfast included to start the day of tourism.",4,2013,10,02
40,Wonderful stay and a great hotel,"Reading this review won't change your mind to book this as pretty much ALL reviews are great. 
I'll keep it simple
location - 5/5. Central, easy walking distance to much of the city
staff - 5/5. The best I've ever come across. Fab recommendations for things to do and restaurants etc. They can't do enough to make the stay perfect
Room 5/5. We took a junior suite which wasn't much more expensive than the standard rooms. It was spacious, comfortable and a pleasure to spend time in.
Bar 5/5 - great staff, good selection
Food 3/5 - expensive...but with so many great restaurants around it was no big deal.

When we go back to Barcelona we'll definitely stay here.",5,2013,09,30
40,Great boutique hotel with wonderful staff,"Just off Passeig de Gracia, hotel is in a great location. Room is spacious and quiet. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as there are lot of cafes around. Staff was wonderful and provided great restaurant recommendation.",4,2013,09,28
40,"Location, location, location!","I loved the location.  Just out of the noise and commotion of the gothic quarter.  This hotel is NOT a five star one in my opinion.  Front lobby area is uncomfortable and stark.  Breakfast was overpriced.  Housekeeping improved after complaints addressed.  The thermostat was confusing and we weren't given instructions in its use until we requested it.  Hotel overpriced for the rooms and quality of service.  But, location was great.",3,2013,09,26
40,Good value hotel,"We stayed here for 10 nights and found the hotel to be of decent-good value. Hotel was clean and the service was very good at all times. You couldn't ask for a better, more central location and still the rooms were very quiet and well insulated from any street noise.

As many other reviewers pointed out the courtyard (and the rooftop) is a very nice quiet refuge from the bustle of the Barelona streets. Staff was very helpful in recommending nearby quality places to dine.

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,09,25
40,Fabulous!,Stayed at the Alma Barcelona in July and could not have been more pleased.  Staff was unbelievable.  Lost luggage upon arrival and the staff kept at it until it arrived 2 days later.  Great location and walking distance to many of the sites around Barcelona.  Would happily stay there again.,5,2013,09,25
40,Some of the best people we met in Barcelona!,"While this is a beautifully appointed 5-star hotel, the thing that stood out is the service of the people here. From the check-in to check-out, the provided such great service. The bags magically appeared in the room; we were given great directions and recommendations; and we made a few friends amongst the genuine people we met. The hotel's location was also excellent - right on the Passeig de Gracia that yields most of the shopping and tourist destinations. 

The room we booked was large and well appointed. The bathroom lavatory was huge by european standards. The only slight problem was the pillows, but we found later that you could request for firmer ones. The complimentary mini-bar was also an excellent touch. 

We will definitely return should we come back to Barcelona soon. Highly recommended!",5,2013,09,24
40,Wow,"Stayed in the executive suite, was fabulous, extremely spacious, very luxurious.  Check-in was smooth, very welcoming...Cava a nice touch.  

Make sure you check out the roof top bar – and try the mojito! 

Would most definitely stay here again",5,2013,09,20
40,Best service anywhere,"Great location near La Padrera; easy to miss if you don't have a can driver or GPS.  The personalized attention from the staff was at a level I'd never seen. Simply unbelievable. Rooms were modern, a bit dark without overhead lighting. Nifty fingerprint-activated door keypad.  Quite pricey but if you want a boutique hotel with tremendous service in a good location, it's worth the splurge.",5,2013,09,20
40,Amazing staff,"I recently stayed at the Alma for just one night with my family and we all wished our stay could have been longer!
We arrived tired after a 30 hour transit from Australia and we immediately felt so much more relaxed after checking in to this amazing hotel, the staff were faultless and could not have been more helpful and pleasant.
Great location, fabulous rooms, wonderful service.............what more can I say, a definite 10/10 in my book!
Would definitely be my number one choice in Barcelona!",5,2013,09,17
40,Great Location-Great Staff,"I just stayed at the Alma for two stays, the first 4 nights the second 2 nights. This hotel is located about a 15 minute walk to the Rambla, the Plaza de Catalunya, and easy walk to most attractions. The hotel itself is immaculate and the rooms comfortable, clean, and outstanding bedding. The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Will definitely be back. Also, they have a great lap pool.",5,2013,09,16
40,"Stunning hotel, fantastic staff, fabulous location.","My friends and I (six 40 something ladies) have just returned from a 3 day stay at this amazing hotel.  We arrived at lunch time and were taken into the garden and given a glass of Cava to complete check-in. We were given lots of great information about the area. The room entry is by fingerprint.  The rooms are spacious with such comfortable beds - memory phone mattress and two lovely pillows - it felt like a giant cuddle getting into bed. The shower was a powerful rain-shower and a separate movable shower head. The toilet is separate with a sliding door blocking off from the main room.  There was plenty of storage and wardrobe space.  The free minibar was replenished daily with water, juices, cokes and one beer.  
The location was just wonderful.  La Pedrera is just at the back of the building.  Sagrada Familiar is a 20 minute stroll. We got a taxi to Placa Reial which was 10 minutes and €7.
There are plenty of bars and restaurants within a short walk away.  We asked the hotel for a breakfast recommendation.  They suggested Cafe Emma which was one block away.  Eggs benedict for less than €5 - amazing.  
The staff were all friendly and went out of their way to help.  
Do not miss the roof top terrace for a sunset drink.  The views over the city are unmissable.  Pricey cocktails €14 but the view in itself is worth it.
I'm finding it hard to find any real faults.  If you choose the Alma I'm sure you will struggle too.",5,2013,09,16
40,Superb hotel! Great location!,Recently stayed here. Rooms are big and comfortable. Great big shower! Staff was incredible- helpful friendly and location central to everything. Rooftop bar is not to be missed. Will definitely stay here again when in Barcelona!!!,5,2013,09,15
40,One of the best hotels I've stayed in!,"I loved my time in Barcelona and the Alma made it all the more special. This hotel is perfect. The staff are helpful and attentive, all speaking very good English. The room was superb. The food at the hotel was exceptional as are the eating/drinking options close by. The location could not be better, enough distance from the heavy duty tourist areas but a 15 min walk to most of the big attractions, and right near a Metro station if required. Also some pretty handy attractions only a block or so away!

I'll definitely be staying here again when next in Barcelona.",5,2013,09,15
40,"Beautiful, modern hotel in a great location.",My husband and I had a lovely time at this hotel. The hotel is only two years only and is in top condition. It is right in the heart of the action and the hotel staff at every helpful. The breakfast is simple but delicious and has a lot to offer for those Jamon lovers out there!,5,2013,09,11
40,A very modern and beautiful hotel!,"Check in was superb. Staff were all knowledgeable and friendly. Pleasant experience throughout the 2 nights stay. Rooms were beautifully designed and cutting edge, simply love it! Location was strategic with walking distance to most Gaudi attractions including sagrada familia.",5,2013,09,09
40,Sophisticated hotel in heart of posh neighborhood,"The concierge staff was excellent. The public spaces absolutely terrific. Amazing ground level courtyard and stunning rooftop bar area. The overall vibe of the hotel is very restrained and perfect for well travelled, discreet world citizens.",4,2013,09,09
40,Amazing hotel with amazing service,"My husband and I stayed for two nights on our way to Majorca, and I cannot praise this hotel enough. It is really incredible value for the rates you pay, and exceeded our expectations by quite a lot! The rooms were of a very high standard - very large and luxurious, with a bathroom bigger than most 3 star hotel bedroom + bathroom. The rooms are quiet and private, and the beds are very very comfortable, with separate super soft quits for each sleeper in the big king bed. There is a lovely walled garden at the back of the hotel that leads into the indoor dining and lounge that was very beautiful, and we had our breakfast and a night cap out here both days we stayed. 
The location was great - we walked to the harbour, and all around the historic areas and main streets etc. Everything is beautiful to look at in Barcelona, so the walking and exploring from the hotel was one of the highlights of our stay. 
Staff were friendly, very helpful, and went out of their way to make us comfortable. No language barriers here - their English was perfect! The biggest highlight, though, was the fact that when we arrived at the airport and discovered that we had left our passports and my jewellery in the room safe and were running too late to make the drive back to the hotel, the wonderful staff there managed to courier everything safely to us in time to make the flight! I'm talking $5000 worth of  jewellery and two Australian passports here, so it was wonderful that we could trust them to do this for us. Thank you so much Alma Hotel staff, and we will definitely return on our next trip.",5,2013,09,09
40,Great customer experience,"We enjoyed two beautiful days at this amazing hotel. Quality of service, attention to details, comfort of rooms, hotel design and amazing staff provide for one of the best customer experiences I have ever had. Highly recommended for couples and romantic getaways.",5,2013,09,07
40,A beautiful haven in a bustling city,"We throughly enjoyed our 6 night stay at the Alma. It's main feature is the staff who are so welcoming from the moment we stepped out of our cab. Just wonderful and nothing is too much trouble.
Hotel is stylish and minimalist blending modern fittings with older style.
Fantastic position, funky rooms. Love the red phone, balcony and the bed was sublime. Roof top bar what a treat.
Breakfast first rate but as others have said a little pricey.
Would definitely recommend.",5,2013,09,06
40,Top class experience,"Stayed at the Alma by chance. Didn't get a room at our hotel of choice and this looked like a good option. delighted thoroughly by everything we experienced, from the super friendly check-in and the rooms to the location. My daughter was delighted most of all by the finger print recognition room access utility. The only downside is a pricey breakfast. Would be nice if that was included in the room rate.",5,2013,09,04
40,Excellent place to stay!,"Alma has amazing staff that were so helpful. Gave great recommendations for restaurants and entertainment. Rooms were spectacular, clean and quiet! the roof-top had a great bar and were able to see terrific sights! We had breakfast in the courtyard and was nice. Alma is in a great location, amazing shopping and a close walk to Los Ramblas.  Would highly recommend staying here!",5,2013,09,03
40,Wonderful service and location,"Booked the Alma using on-line discount hotel service with relatively short lead time.  Needed suite to accommodate visit from 21 year old son for weekend.  Hotel met our needs and more.  Staff was incredible, and the hotel entrance is designed to facilitate interaction with terrific ""front desk""/concierge team.  Alma does not distinguish ""check in"" from concierge--the young but knowledgeable staff ""do it all.""  Restaurant recommendations, tour guides, tickets, suggested activities?  All are handled well.  Room was very large and well designed, combining great Barcelona modern (very high end bath room) with wood internal shutters on older windows, looking out on beaux arts iron and flowers.  Beautiful and quiet internal courtyard.  And piece de resistance--the totally ""cool"" roof-top bar open only to guests.  There was never a crowd, always a great summer breeze, and sight-lines to the Sagrada Familia and other Gaudi buildings.  Great location--easy to get everywhere (excellent subway system; abundant cabs).  Neighborhood more upper east side than west village--which was more than OK.",5,2013,09,02
40,"Pleasure, beauty and family welcomed","From the minute you step into the Alma hotel we were embraced with an gracious smile and an invitation to sit down and chat. Tired from traveling and kids in tow, the front desk  ( we were greeted by Michael) just wanted to get to know us, they offered us some cava and literally got us relaxed within minutes. They got down to business in a gentle fashion, figured out what we needed for the stay to be a good one and provided us all  with all the necessary information, reservations and directions of the city we wanted. This hotel should be proud to know that all the staff worked so well together, they provided the same interest in our stay as they did for the numerous other clients that walked in the door after us. Our children (14yrs, and 6yrs ) were met with the same respect and loved the whole ambience of the hotel and its staff. Great decor , super location and fabulous food too. We are a family who is absolutely going to stay at another ALMA. Bravo.

P.S. Our rooms ( 505 & 506 ) were close enough to hear the Jazz at Gaudi's La Pedrera roof top.",5,2013,09,02
40,"Beautiful, central, enjoyable","I stayed in a suite which was well designed and nicely laid out.  It reminded me of a typical Aman room with a sleeping area, a living room, and a giant bathroom.  Everything about my stay exceeded my expectations, and all at very good value.  I did find the breakfast a little disappointing—the pastries didn't seem fresh or locally made, the fruit was skinned over by 10 am when I ate.  The midlevel breakfast was beautifully presented and the service was great, but I wish the quality of food had been higher.  It would fit with the high standards everywhere else in the hotel.

The fingerprint key was great, worked better than the card systems often do, and there was nothing to lose while I explored the city.  

All around wonderful hotel, and base from which to enjoy the city.",5,2013,09,01
40,A great but expensive stay - not 5 star,"We enjoyed our time in Barcelona by staying at the Alma. The location of the hotel is fantastic - a short walk to many attractions and great restaurants but away from the crowds. 

The service we received from the front desk was very helpful, making a number if suggestions that saved us a lot of time e.g. booking our tickets to the Sagrada Familia beforehand for us, saving us a two hour wait to enter. 

While we enjoyed our stay, we wouldn't consider the property to be 5 star (more 3.5 star, but it was priced as a 5 star). We have stayed at a number of hotels around the world within a similar price bracket per night, both boutique and major chains, and we were expecting a much higher quality of room, amenities and room service. It reminded us more of a utilitarian business hotel rather than a destination property. 

If we return to Barcelona, we would be looking to pay considerably less for a hotel of similar standards as The Alma. That said, it was a great base for exploring Barcelona. ",4,2013,09,01
40,Almost Perfect,"Found The Alma on Trip Advisor so thank you to all of you contributors and booked it for our four nights in  Barcelona.

The Hotel Ama is an exceptional property.  It is in a perfect part of the city to walk (yes we are serious walkers) to everything.  The staff is outstanding, the decor for us is magnificent.  It is very modern and chic while being comfortable and amazingly quiet.  The beds are heaven and upgrade to a courtyard room and there is absolutely no noise and wonderful views of Gaudi's rooftops.
There are dozens if not hundreds of restaurants, cafes, Tapas and bars within a few blocks in  either of the four directions.  We found a neighborhood gem for breakfast as well as a neighborhood Tapas bar that we discovered that the King of Spain frequents when he is in Barcelona.  Three of Gaudi's principle works are a few blocks away as well as the ""Fifth Avenue"" of Barcelona.

The rain shower is heaven and the big glass walled enclosure is amazing for Europe.  The finger scan key entry is also amazing so no more de-magnetized hotel keys.

The roof top lounge for a late evening drink and to drink  in the city views in  all directions is a must as well.

OK ... What kept it from being PERFECT in every respect.  Sadly, only we WiFi junkies would complain.  WiFi is free and works great in the lobby.  Being a renovated old building with lots of thick  walls makes WiFi from all parts of the very big room great or non existent.   Very minor but annoying to stand at the sink to check out restaurants on  the web.

Lastly but not an issue for us because a coffee and roll is a perfect breakfast for us at any of the cafes is their morning breakfast buffet.   It looked and smelled  wonderful but at 25euros per person, I would rather spend it on Tapas later in the day.  Very minor for us but for those that want breakfast before starting out ... a pause.

I will absolutely return to Barcelona and I will absolutely return to the Hotel Alma.",5,2013,08,28
40,Excellent choice for Barcelona.,"This is a truly excellent hotel for Barcelona. I booked it after seeing the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and was not at all disappointed. First of all, the location is excellent. It is one block from La Pedrera, one of the major landmarks in the city. It is located just off the major thoroughfare in the city and is a 5 to 10 minute walk from Plaza Catalunya. You cannot do much better than this hotel in terms of location. The decor is very tasteful. One feels very comfortable and a sense of peace when one walks into this hotel. It also has a very nice courtyard which provides an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, should you need one. Our room was very spacious and very well appointed. It was a very comfortable experience. And the staff was also tremendously helpful. Upon arrival, we asked for a lunch restaurant recommendation, which was three blocks from the hotel. When we saw the long line outside of the restaurant we knew we were in for a treat. The restaurant was so good that we ended up going back three times during our four-day stay. All in all, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Stay there and you won't regret it.",5,2013,08,27
40,Very impressed with Alama Barcelona,"My wife and I thought the design of the contemproary adaptive reuse was very well done, particularly the room and exterior courtyard/ bar area.  It was a wonderful rspite from the active street one half block away.  We had a view of the top of Casa Mila from our window.   We enjoyed a drink on the rooftop with Sagrada Familia off in the distance.   One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and a good value for the money.  The staff was very service oriented, suggesting a place for dinner.  The complimentary mini bar was nice.",5,2013,08,26
40,Excellent,"Reading the other TA reviews, you will not be surprised to learn that I found it excellent. Staff, location, size of rooms, design was top notch. A luxury design hotel without any frills. Just plain excellent. I must highlight the roof top bar. Fantastic views over all of Barcelona. Sitting up there with a well made mojitos made the trip for me ;-)",5,2013,08,26
40,"Excellent hotel, quiet high end neighborhood, great staff.","I'm a bit late getting this review out!  We were at the Alma for about a week this past June. I chose this hotel as it was away from the more rambunctious tourist area and I wanted to be sure that our nights were not disturbed.  It's just a few buildings off a main suburban road lined with high end shops and restaurants.  If you are inclined it's only two blocks from a muti starred restaurant but we found lovely places to eat all within the neighborhood.  Some wonderful meals.  It is also just around the corner from La Pedrera, one of the 'must do' Gaudi buidlings and down the road from La Sagrada  Famillia , the Gaudi church..do not miss that.  You can walk all the way to the harbour or take a taxi as they are not very expensive..5 Euros maybe..to get to the tourist area ' the Gothic' quarter.. lots to see down there..very crowded and busy..but you must go.   And when I say you can walk...I'm 64, bad knees and out of shape..and I walked it without a problem..takes awhile but doable and it's lined with outdoor cafes and shops so it's nice to stop along the way.  So  that's the location.

The hotel itself is very modern in design and decor .. large open area that serves as a dining/bar/sitting and having a coffee room with large glass wall that looks out into an expansive courtyard with beautiful plantings and table and chairs for lunch/dinner/drinks..beautiful very large area. 

The Staff is outstanding.  This is a 5 star hotel with a very relaxed atmosphere...that means you might need to get the door on your own if no one happens to be there.  They are friendly, extremely helpful and can't do enough for you.  What more do you want.  My friends just stayed in a 5 star hotel in rome and the concierge refused to speak to them.  So I am happy with a relaxed 5 star where the staff is extremely friendly and professional.

The room , Junior Suite,  was large, bathroom fabulous..enormous with all the gleaming tapware you could want..rain shower etc ..    Two large flat screens..nice sitting area...lovely old wood floors...big shuttered windows (also had a block out shade thingy) .  Very modern.
The bed was very comfortable.  Lighting is a bit dim but there are reading lights by the bed.

The halls are quite dim ...think mood lighting.... and that does feel a bit unusual but it's just part of the design.

The restaurant is, to me, there for convenience.  it's not like a proper 'dining room' .. more a large space set out with couches and chairs and both low and high tables.  The menu is small but the food was excellent.  We had dinner there our first night as we were tired of travelling and couldn't be bothered finding a place to eat..we hadn't noticed the two restaurants 50 meters away.  And I'm glad we did...our meal was wonderful and the service was great.  A lovely waitress .. to my embarrassment I've forgotten her name...Lisa?   An absolutely charming young woman .  But I could use 'charming' to describe the whole staff. 

Breakfast was a continental buffet and was lovely. 

I highly recommend this hotel.   If you like lots of buzz and noise around you..go stay in the Gothic area...this Gracia area is quiet, full of restaurant and beautiful stores and your sleep won't be disturbed.  Go and stay.",5,2013,08,24
40,Beautiful hotel and staff,We loved this hotel.  We could open the door overlooking the courtyard.  The room was so restful and roomy.  The bed was so comfortable.  Lovely to sit in the courtyard with a drink - we never made it to the roof!  All the staff were lovely especially our girl in the courtyard who used to work in Sydney.  We would love to stay again and recommend it.,5,2013,08,22
40,Stay Here!,"The service at this Hotel is awesome! Virtually every person that works at the front desk is also a very capable Concierge.  Yes the hallways are very dark but the rooms more than make up for it being spacious light & airy. The staff absolutely goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable & will help you in any way they can.
We absolutely loved it here & were sad to leave. Next time in Barcelona we will stay here.
You will not be disappointed!",5,2013,08,21
40,Excellence in personalized service,"It was our third visit to Barcelona ,we stayed in three different hotels,but Alma was the best.the dedicated staff of hotel were amazing from the reception to the room service.the food was exceptional but one special thank to Patricia who made us feel at home by her attention and her skills. The only thing we missed was the outdoor pool . I invite everyone to enjoy Barcelona by staying in this hotel.",5,2013,08,19
40,loved this hotel!,"We absolutely loved this hotel - it felt so luxurious and we really felt like we got our money's worth!!  The Alma Barcelona was beautiful, quiet, clean, modern and had a fabulous location in the heart of the Eixample neighborhood. The bathroom had two sinks, a beautiful deep tub and a fantastic rain shower. The room was very quiet and the beds were extremely comfortable, exactly what you want after a long day of walking around! There was also a small fridge, safe, lots of storage and a nice view of the back courtyard. Everything was great, including the front desk staff and bellman who were all extremely polite and helpful. 

The ONLY negative thing I can say about this hotel is that they ignored the Do Not Disturb sign - even when we put it up they still came in and cleaned the rooms and even tried to come in when we were there once. I'm not sure if this issue with the DND sign is a European thing or not..... We were very pleased with how clean the rooms were just not with how eager they were to clean them.",5,2013,08,17
40,Fingerprint key,"One of the greatest hotel ivem been to! Perfect service, perfect location, bed to die for, pillows to die even more more, perfect interior design. Plus the minibar is free and you get a refill every day ",5,2013,08,17
40,"Alright, but not 5 star","Let's begin with the positive points: the girl serving us at breakfast was very nice and helpful, the location is very convenient and the bar on the rooftop is absolutely amazing.. which let's you forget about the very limited seleciton of drinks. 
To improve, in our eyes, is the staffing and internal communications. For breakfast, the hotel is sometimes understaffed. There is no bellboy that helps you with the luggage/door/elevator, the little details that make a 5* hotels.. There doesn't seem to be a concierge either. When we arrived, some lamps did not work, so we let the person in charge know to have it fixed the next day because we did not have the energy to move to another room since we arrived at around midnight. Unfortunately, the lamps were not fixed during our entire stay. Honestly, this is weak. A room and all it's details should be checked and perfectly working before giving it to a guest. Maybe with the the job of a Housekeeping Manager doesn't exist?
The bathrooms are rather small and there are no doors, neither to the bathroom nor to the shower to give you some privacy. Bathroom amenities were never replenished. 
Once we were in our room when roomservice knocked and we asked them to come later. The result was, that they didn't come at all. 
The breakfast was good, although, nothing was chilled or on ice and so you can imagine what cheese and meat looks like after 10 minutes in the Barcelona summer. Not so amazing.. and not very hygienic after all. 
After all, it was nice because it wasn't so crowded, but if you have the money and you wish to go to a top quality hotel, don't spend it here - you pay too much for what you actually get",2,2013,08,17
40,Great Hotel,A great hotel as many other Trip Advisor guests have indicated. Very good location and very helpful staff.  Close to great shopping and good restaurants. Nothing to complain about. Thanks for the great facility and service.,5,2013,08,14
40,5-star minimalism,"We arrived here from Greece having stayed at one of my favorite all-time hotels and our group had an even better stay here.   The Alma Barcelona's staff is top-notch 100%  We had the same quality at the Alma Seville, so whatever Alma is doing for training and selection of their staff is perfect.

This hotel's interior is minimalism and open spaces, the size of which will surprise you.   It has a huge courtyard in the back and large, informal dining area just above the lobby.   The bar is adjacent to this and the set-up just works.   The very first thing you need to do after check-in is get a sangria.  It is the best sangria I have had in my months in Spain, of which I pretty much constantly drink sangria.   Again, it is particular to Alma's as the same mixture was also imbibed in Seville's Alma and is unbeatable.    

We had the executive suite and it was very spacious with all the amenities you could want.  The room was split in two by a divider which had 2 TV's facing opposite each other.  The shower was one of the best rainfall showers I have ever stepped in and the Bulgari items were exceptionally nice.  Room service was fast and exact, again, served by the most attentive and friendly staff possible.  Probably my favorite/unique aspect of the hotel is the fingerprint scanner for entry into your room.  How convenient is it to not have to lug around a key?  Very.

While the pool is small and the spa is less of a spa and more of a ""space"", most people would find this adequate for their needs.   

A luxury that we almost missed out on was the rooftop bar, which overlooks the Pedrera/Casa Mia, which is literally on the next street.   Additional reasons to love the location is that it is very near the main shopping street, great restaurants and stops for all of the tourist buses and not too far from a metro station.

This is another top 10-hotel for me based on all the reasons above and the only minor gripe I could come up with is the average spa area.   If that is low on your priorities, you cannot go wrong staying here.",5,2013,08,13
40,Fantastic hotel,"We booked the Alma for 4 nights in the executive suite and were really pleased.  The staff were extremely helpful, recommending places to eat and transport around the city etc.  When we arrived, the reception desk was full so we were taken out to the garden, served a drink and we 'checked in' out there with a member of the reception desk.  The rooftop terrace is an amazing place to soak up the sunset although we did find the drink prices a little steep. 16e for a vodka (without mixer).  We would definitely stay at the Alma again!",5,2013,08,12
40,Perfect weekend awat,"We have just returned from a weekend away in Barcelona. The Hotel Alma was faultless, our room (Junior Suite) was very clean and spacious - with the added free soft drinks in the mini bar. The view we had over the garden was lovely. The bed was huge and so comfortable, we had the perfect night sleep as we couldn't hear or see a thing, due to the black out window shutters.
Location is brilliant as you can walk to everything - Gothic Quater being a 30 min stroll away or a 5 euro taxi ride.
We chose not to have breakfast here as I found it abit exspensive for what it was - we opted to have a walk around and found a lovely place just behind the Hotel that served organic breakfasts at half the price.
The gym and swimming pool was also lovely - as it was in the basement not many people seemed to venture down.
What sets this hotel apart from others is the staff. They are very friendly and knowlegable about the area and nothing seemed to much trouble. Looking forward to going back.",5,2013,08,12
40,THE SLOWEST INTERNET ON THE PLANET!!!,"Everything else in this hotel is the truly FIRST CLASS, but I am giving them bad overall review perhaps to ""shake them up"" because it is an absolute shame to have a 5-star hotel with an Internet speed of a 20-years ago 56K old modem. There is no excuse fort this especially at the price of the room they have. Another issue is that their TV does not have CNN - enough said.",1,2013,08,12
40,Terrific Hotel and Great Location!,"We just returned from our stay in Barcelona and the Alma Hotel was a major highlight of our stay. The room was clean and spacious.  The roof top terrace was a special place to take in a sunset,  the wide variety on the breakfast buffet (a bit over priced, but good if you are hungry) and the awesome staff made our stay a special one!  The complimentary drinks in the room refrigerator was an added, unexpected treat.  The hotel is located one block from the main shopping and dining area.  It is within walking distance to most attractions and those further away are an inexpensive taxi ride.  We travel frequently and would highly recommend this hotel to the sofisticaded traveler.  We stayed in one of their junior suites that was well worth the minimal increase in cost.  It is also a short taxi ride to the airport.  Kudos to this hotel!  We can't wait to try another of your accommodations.",5,2013,08,11
40,Cool Hotel,"We love the warm welcome and the staff, they absoltuely treated us like royalties. They were great with all our enquiries and with recommending places to see and do. The junior suite was comfortable and big for European size.  Had a very good nights rest here, Thank you",5,2013,08,11
40,Excellent hotel,"We visited in April 2013 for our honeymoon. The hotel is a clever conversion of an old building. The decor is ultra modern, with very subdued lighting which wouldn't suit everyone. We booked a junior suite and the room was extremely spacious and comfortable. The free minibar isn't too exciting, with the odd beer and a couple of soft drinks. If I was being really picky, I would say that the toilet roll was very disappointing for the price you pay, it was more like what I had at school!

The best thing about the hotel is the staff. They achieved a perfect balance of warmth and professionalism and made us feel most welcome. We didn't use the hotel restaurant, it seemed a bit characterless to me, but the staff gave us great recommendations, making bookings for us and printing out directions.

The location of the hotel is excellent - within walking distance of many attractions, yet still quiet and peaceful. 

All in all a great experience and we would return.",5,2013,08,10
40,amazing staff and perfect location!,"While on our honeymoon, we stayed in Barcelona the day before our cruise departed from its port. After leaving the airport and arriving at the ALMA hotel at 1030AM, the concierge greeted us with champagne and smiles. They could not have been more hospitable! Not only did they check us in early, they recommended several attractions and restaurants as well as made online reservations for us. Because of their foresight, we did not have to wait in any lines to get into the sagrada familia! Also, their recommendations for lunch and dinner were delicious! Everything was walking distance and we were able to enjoy the famous downtown Barcelona area without any stress. 

When we arrived in our room, we were impressed with the modern decor as well as the very comfortable bed and the huge soak in tub. my husband was especially pleased with their ""fingerprint"" room access instead of the typical hotel key card.",5,2013,08,08
40,"Great location, beautiful hotel, charming and helpfull staff","My husband and I are currently staying at Alma Barcelona during our 3 week journey through France and Spain. Alma is a very beautiful hotel located just next to La Pedrera and Paseo Gracia. 
If you want great location, chic decor and very helpfull and charming service, Alma is the perfect choice. Enjoy the rooftop terrace with amazing views of the city.
The pool could be slightly bigger and the gym could be better equipped, though, but it hasn't effected our stay in any negative way:)",5,2013,08,07
40,Great location and quiet,"Excellent 5 star Hotel in a quiet but good position to easily access the top class shopping strip only 100m away, and then another block or so to the famed La Rambla - you can walk the length of this and then walk across the boardwalk to the Port area which is very picturesque, also has a very modern shopping centre, large movie compex, restaurants with scenic views, and also a really good kids play area.
To the Hotel itself, no problem with check-in at reception and the fingerprint technology to allow keyless entry to your room is a definite winner (no lost keys!).The room was a good size and was very modern and clean the bed was VERY comfortable.The staff at reception were very helpful in advising good restaurant options (see reviews).
Buffet Breakfast is a bit steep at 25 euros per person and that is why we saw very few people using it. We used it for the week we were there and the only down side was there were no changes to what was on offer, but I must emphasise what was there was of the highest quality, and a plus in the breakfast area is the young female (Vera) - when she is on duty things are run very efficiently.
We would certainly stay here again when visiting Barcelona.",5,2013,08,07
40,"Quiet, modern, elegant, comfortable hotel in great location","We had a wonderful four night stay at the Alma Barcelona.  Our room was spacious and attractively laid out in modern style, and although we were on the street, the room was exceedingly quiet.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and responsive.  There was a fantastic breakfast buffet served in a lovely interior courtyard.  A real treat was the rooftop terrace, with a full bar and great views of the city, and only open to hotel guests.  The location is excellent, near the Passeig de Gracia and not far from the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, and Casa Batllo.   I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2013,08,06
40,"Ideal location, Comfortable Hotel with Excellent Service","Stayed for a long weekend.
Hard to beat the location, just off the Passeig de Gràcia. Comfortable and spacious rooms with a clean and modern feel.
Service was excellent and the staff were consistently helpful and friendly.
Would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,08,01
40,Great location! Relaxing evenings on the roof deck!,"Stayed for four nights. Room was nice and pretty large; it felt new or recently renovated. Staff was interested, friendly and helpful. Free Internet and mini-bar. The hotel has added a lovely roof deck recently with options for a quiet or more lively atmosphere on different sides of the roof...there was a DJ one night...the deck is not well known yet, so it was a very peaceful, cool place to relax after a hot day exploring the city...short walk to Metro, La Pedroia, Sagrada Familia...definitely would stay here again! Did not eat here or use the spa/fitness facilities.",5,2013,07,31
40,KRM2013,"Stayed one night on start of Cruise. Would stay their again. Great room, location, and staff. Quite rooms, with  plenty of restaurants and shopping within blocks. Keyless entrance to rooms fingerprint.",5,2013,07,30
40,"Great location, wonderful hotel","We will be back! This hotel is wonderful...wonderful location, beautiful spacious rooms, extremely helpful staff. We stayed here for four nights, went to Provence for a few days, then returned for a night. Originally we were staying the last night in another hotel in the Gothic Quarter, then changed it to the Alma because we loved it so much!",5,2013,07,30
40,One of the best terrace restaurants in Barcelona today,"This is about the dining experience in the terrace restaurant at Hotel Alma in Barcelona late July 2103. What we liked were many things - ambience (great lighting, music and furinshings), setting (gardened patio interior - not that common in Barcelona), service (extremely attentive), table setting and food (Catalan / international with some creative touches). I had the salmon tartare to start - served on a dill essenced creamy yoghurt base - unusual, surprising and not too rich. Main course was a take on the traditional ""Mar y Montaña"" (chicken and crayfish rice) perfect flavours, great texture - a dish to linger over. The group had previously decided to skip dessert - though from previous experience the chef has a talent with pastires and spoon desserts - and head for the new roof terrace to have a cocktail and see the sights from eight floors up. This is a recent additon to the hotel and as with all things new, needs time to ""run in"".  The decor here followed the designer's love for natural materials with an approach verging on the minimalist - in keeping with the general look of the hotel.  The only thing to comment was that the bartender came to take our orders - but only the first two of the group!!! Then he went away, prepared the two requested cocktails and then came back with these and took the rest of the group's order!! Teething troubles obviously!! All in all well worth a visit.",5,2013,07,28
40,Fantastic all around,"Deserves its rating - so glad I read the reviews - perfect in every way - amazing staff, will take care of all your needs , outstanding rooms, spacious and beautiful decor, beyond clean and beautiful linen, great restaurant, nice roof top for, drinks, super modern accommodations, keyless entrance to rooms w/fingerprint , free mini bar w water and soft drinks, unlimited.....
Location could not be better.",5,2013,07,27
40,Highly reccomendeded,Great hotel- upgraded to Delixe room. Close to main tourist sites. Beautiful courtyard for breakfast . Free minibar as well. Very comfortable quiet room. Would stay here again. Staff excellent - booked out La Sagrada Familia tickets for us. ,5,2013,07,25
40,amazing location and very good hotel,"Excellent hotel, amazing location.

This hotel is very good, they have a very central location, easy to walk everywhere. The staff are very friendly and want to help anyway that they can. The coolest thing about this hotel is the fingerprint key to get into your room. Key cards are a thing of the past, now only fingerprinting.

The spa massage i had was amazing, totally worth the money. The only bad thing is the spa room is next door to the swimming pool, which means you cant relax as you hear everything happening.

Pool is tiny and you cant really swim.
The gym is terrible with not enough equipment. The room is also too small.
The hotel food is terrible.. I was there for a business trip and got back late every night so had no chance then to eat in the hotel. I went through the whole menu for the 5 nights i was there and all the food was disgusting.... BUT the breakfast was excellent. They must have a different chef for breakfast and dinner.

The rooms are very clean and tidy apart from the vents - they dont get cleaned and there is dust ll stuck in them.. I didn't want to put the air-conditioning on as i would just be inhaling dust particles.

Apart from a few bad parts, this hotel is really very good. If they just cleaned up on a few pointers it really would be the best in Barcelona.",4,2013,07,23
40,highly recommended,very good hotel. perfect value for money. attentive and friendly staff. food is delicious and good location. highly recommended also for familyes with kids. gim normal. close to metro. our room it was very big same as the bed,5,2013,07,23
40,So pleased we picked Hotel Alma!,I did a lot of research on Baracelona hotels before booking Alma and am so pleased with the choice I made. This is a beautiful boutique style hotel in an upmarket area of Barcelona surrounded by amazing shopping and restaurants but within easy reach of all attraction in the city. The staff went out of their way to help us choose some great restaurants and make square we had a perfect stay. The bedrooms as very quiet overlooking the courtyard and the beds themselves were extremely comfortable. All in all had a lovely time.,5,2013,07,21
40,Fantastic Hotel,Perfectly located this 5 star hotel. Nice big rooms. A shower better then at home. Free minibar. Very helpful and most friendly staff. Nothing was too much. Beautiful rooftop bar with magnificent view over the city. The should promote rooftop bar more. Wifi routers should be placed in more locations. Breakfast is lovely. Will come back!,5,2013,07,20
40,THE BEST OF BARCELONA,"If you are looking for an outstanding hotel in Barcelona, stay at Alma, close to Passig de Gracia in the fashionable area. In a quiet neighborhood you will find the staff completely accommodating and switched on, able to recommend local attractions [and have visited them], make arrangements for meals, assist with purchasing tickets, call transportation - these guys know how to make you feel comfortable and welcome. The rooms are spacious and well designed with mod cons, and excellent bathroom with oversized shower, great storage areas and plenty of plugs. A bed worth taking home and a great breakfast in the courtyard behind the building. I highly recommend Alma for it's overall style and comfort.",5,2013,07,20
40,Excellent Alma!,"We were greeted at the Alma by the friendliest door men and front desk staff and  a cold glass of Cava, which was much appreciated on a hot Barcelona day. The front desk staff really could not do enough to assist us and went out of their way with regards to a missing piece of luggage. Excellent restaurant recommendations too!
The hotel is stunning, very stylish and modern within a stunning building with an amazing roof terrace bar overlooking Barcelona.
Location is excellent, a 20 min walk to Las Ramblas and La Sagrada Familia.
I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bit of modern luxury - fantastic! One of the best hotels I've stayed in.",5,2013,07,17
40,Excellent hotel,"We went on our honeymoon to Barcelona and stayed at the Alma hotel.
It is a very stylish hotel with nice rooms and perfect service. Quiet with a very nice spa / pool section in the basement.

It's located in the middle of Barcelona near to the main street (shopping) and 2 km. away from La Rambla, so you don't have to worry about getting feed up with tourists.",5,2013,07,16
40,Superb,"Everything about this hotel is just wonderful. Staff were very friendly and helpful, facilities are clean and well maintained, and our room was just lovely. It was expensive, but it's worth every penny, especially if you're on special trip with loved one. One of the best hotels we ever stayed in.",5,2013,07,15
40,Welcome Relief after a long flight,"The Alma was perfect for us after flying all night (and not sleeping) from the US to Barcelona.  We arrived at 10:30 AM, and much to our surprise, our room was ready and we were able to get in and settled, shower, and rest for a few hours!  This is quite different from US hotels, who don't allow you to check in until 3 PM or so...

The check in process was excellent, quick and easy.  The front desk people were extremely helpful, attentive and friendly.  We had a meal in the restaurant, which was also wonderful, out on the patio.  Attentive, friendly staff made our meal time enjoyable.

The room is perfect with a king size bed and free mini bar, free wifi, and a robe  and slippers for our weary bodies.  Our room had a lovely sitting area with a desk and 2 easy chairs. (Executive suite)  There is a safe in the room for your valuables.  The hotel is located smack in the middle of town, with access to city center stores, restaurants and sites.

This hotel is a find!!  We will surely return here when we come to Barcelona again.  Thank you, Alma Hotel.",5,2013,07,15
40,Excellent!,"What can you say that hasn't been already said?  Superior in every way.  Rooms are modern and new.  Separate toilet area.  Dark at night.  Great bed.  Lots of electrical outlets.  Wifi A-okay, fast.  More storage space than you probably have at home.  Big issue:  insufficient lighting over sink for shaving or make-up.  Surprising because it seems designers thought of everything.  Beautiful property.  Nice breakfast area and patio lounge.  Outstanding service from employees.  Special shout-out to Javier and Sarray who arranged dinners, made suggestions, took care of laundry problem and even took us for a walk to find a train station.  Location could not be better--on main boulevard, Passeig de Gracia, and near to everything, either on foot or via metro.  We stayed in Room 610, a grand deluxe on top floor with view of La Pedrera roof.  Didn't eat breakfast at hotel, many coffee-croissant places within 5 minute walk, so why spend 25E?  Excepting Paris, which is in a class of its own, Barcelona is nicest city in Europe.  It has everything you'd want:  nice people, beaches, great weather, food and architecture.  A great walking city.  Safe and clean.  When we return it will be to the Alma Barcelona.",5,2013,07,15
40,Will also be our choice of hotel on our next trip to Barcelona,Nice and quiet hotel with pleasant and service minded staff. An outdoor restaurant in nice Spanish surroundings. The air-conditioning of our room and indoor areas were excellent. A nice place to come back to after sightseeing in Barcelona.,4,2013,07,14
40,Excellent hotel,"A fantastic hotel located perfectly in the city. Staff were brilliant both friendly and efficient. Didn't eat at the hotel but had drinks in the garden and on the roof top terrace. The bed rooms are spacious, quiet, clean and well stocked with good quality toiletries and drinks in the complimentary minibar.  Excellent experience would definitely return to this hotel again.",5,2013,07,14
40,Great hotel,The location is superb and the quality of the hotel and service provided by the staff was faultless. We did not eat any meals at the hotel but there are many good bars and restaurants within a short stroll. The room was quiet and the shady garden was an oasis of quiet. The beds were very comfortable and the bedroom and bathroom were a great size. The complimentary minibar was a bonus. The staff on reception could not have been more friendly or helpful.I would definitely recommend this hotel and would look nowhere else to stay if I return to Barcelona.,5,2013,07,13
40,Excellent city centre hotel modern clean with helpful staff.,"Roof top bar makes this hotel - Amazing views at night with excellent staff and perfect cocktails. An ideal hotel for romantic break with comfortable rooms with interesting design. The breakfasts are expensive for a limited , albeit good quality , selection. ",4,2013,07,12
40,"Nice Boutique Hotel, good location","Let's start off with the positive things. Great location to get around the city by foot or sightseeing bus. (hop on hop off bus is 2 blocks away, get your ticket at the hotel  for euro 24) The hotel really nice boutique style, very lovely and competent, helpful staff. The interior modern, minimalist, dimmed lights (which I actually love). Awesome roof deck with view of the Gaudi buildings terrace 2 blocks away. Also a very nice courtyard terrace for breakfast or dinner. The rooms are nice and spacious for a city hotel, also minimalisic interior. Beds are comfortable and good size. View into the courtyard in our room. Good closet space, big mirror in hallway. Complimentary mini bar with water, juice and beer. As much as I like the seperate toilet with an extra sliding door to seperate it from the bedroom, in my opinion a little sink is missing. (also a toilet brush is missing) The bathroom itsself good size, big shower and tub and a double sink. Huge drawback is the missing door in the bathroom. As much as I love the person I share my room with, I do appreciate my bathroom privacy. Also if the other person is sleeping you have to basically wake them by switching on the light in the bathoom to wash your hands or get ready. Not cool. But lovely bathroom products, even though a vanity kit was missing. Some spots in the room remained very dusty throughout the stay. (my suitcase looked like I stored it in a never used attic) They have a small gym, a sauna, a hamam and an indoor pool. When we visited the spa a maintenance guy was cleaning and working on the door in front of the glass doored sauna so I immediately withdraw the thought of a relaxing saune stay. Overall great place to stay in Barcelona and if they would step  up the game, dust the rooms properly and add a bathroom door and a sink in the toilet I would surely come back.",3,2013,07,11
40,"Excellent hotel, service is outstanding","Everything is great about this place. Staff is so very helpful, serviceminded and has great knowledge of the city. Fingerprint access to rooms was very convenient. Rooftop had just been opened when we stayed at the hotel, it was super.",5,2013,07,10
40,"great location, great service, great hotel","This hotel is most perfectly located just 30m off the Passage de Gracia and one block away from the Gaudi beauty, Casa Mila (La Pedrera). This means you are right at the beginning of the shopping area leading down to the Plaza Catalunya and on to the beach, next to the infamous La Rambla and literally around the corner from 3 main Gaudi attractions (Casa Mila, Casa Battlo and Sagrada Familia). 
The hotel is only 2 years old so its modern, clean, well-designed and comfortable. Check-in and check-out were smooth and room service 24hrs - limited menu but very good quality. 
We stayed in an executive suite with a Roman bath and the room was impeccable. Bed was huge and very comfortable, room had full a/c, large windows with blinds and shutters, great lighting and a super bathroom. The bathroom was a perfect size with a huge shower, bath and two sinks as well as separate toilet and bidet, and best of all Bulgari toiletries as well as good towels, robes, slippers, toothbrush sets, etc.
The hotel was clean although could housekeeping have been a little better especially in the bathroom. we didn't have any real problems but just could have been that much more for a 5 star hotel. 
All staff were all completely helpful and friendly, and the front desk staff were especially kind and good at suggesting or recommending places to go or eat, as well as helping with bookings.
We didn't eat in the restaurant except breakfast twice, which was ok. The selection in the breakfast buffet was good quality, but certainly not the widest choice or anything amazing. For us this was a disappointment because we are big on breakfast, but might not matter to others. 
The rooftop bar was also a great place to start (or end) your night with fantastic views of the Sagrada Familia, the rooftop of La Pedrera, and the church on Mount Tibidabo, which are all beautifully lit at night (until 12). 
The price was reasonable considering the location, service level and quality of the room. 
I would and will recommend this hotel to everyone that considers going to Barcelona. We might have a few ""suggestions"" like for range at breakfast, but definitely no complaints. You will enjoy your trip much more if you stay here. Will probably stay there next time too!!!",5,2013,07,09
40,Cool boutique hotel w great service,"This hotel reminds me of an Andaz, Very modern, minimilistic and clean lines. The rooms were Very comfortable and spacious. The staff were super friendly and helpful. I also enjoyed the rooftop terrace bar. I would recommend this place to a friend and would stay there again. ",5,2013,07,05
40,"Great location, great service, knowledgeable and overall awesome!","The hotel is one block off the ultra high end shopping district.  Great restaurants, shopping and people watching.  Hotel was quiet, fashionable and hip.  Very friendly staff throughout.  Gym was small, but that was the only hint of dissatisfaction.  Would stay there again and again!",5,2013,07,05
40,Great Hotel,"Super hotel.   The location is excellent and we walked everywhere from here.  The room is very modern with a great view.  It also has a complimentary (non-alcoholic) mini bar.  Rather than having a key for the room,  each room has a fingerprint reader which is really cool.  And the garden is a great place to escape the bustle of the city.",5,2013,06,30
40,Deserves it's 5* Rating,"From the moment you arrive until you depart, the service & quality are superlative. Everything from ck in, baggage handling, turn down to newspapers, they are right on top of every detail. My bag was lost in transit, & they knocked themselves silly helping me to recover it. Spacious, well lit rooms with all amenities. Great, spacious bathrooms w/ good lighting & lots of towels-big walk in shower & beautiful  bathtub. Nice dining terrace & excellent roof top venue with drinks, music & fantastic view. Every member of staff has excellent training & ""can do"" attitude.    Very doubtful if you will find better in Barcelona.",5,2013,06,30
40,We loved this Hotel,"We arrived at the Alma in the rain and were welcomed by a lovely staff member who immediately made us comfortable and made sure we were given a large umbrella!  The lobby, lounge and restaurant were quiet, modern and sophisticated.  Our room was upscale, immaculate and pleasingly different, with a very comfortable bed and a large walk-in shower.

When we asked for a restaurant recommendation, we had no idea how lucky we would be.  Arrangements were made for a dinner at Sauc....one of our best ever restaurant experiences.

The Alma is a very special hotel and walking distance to many of Barcelona's attractions. Full marks to the staff!  We will definitely stay there again!",5,2013,06,24
40,True perfection,"After reviewing multiple hotels through Trip Advisor, I decided to book my wife and I into this hotel for a surprise birthday getaway.  I simply couldn’t have made a better choice.

From the moment the doorman let us in, the whole stay was unquestionably perfect.  The check in process was handled very slickly whilst the wife and I enjoyed a glass of bubbly, before we whisked upstairs to one of the executive suites.  The room itself was ultra-modern and minimalist as described in many other reviews.  Please don’t think that this means the rooms lack character, in fact quite the opposite, we found our room to be beautifully equipped, spotlessly clean and incredibly comfortable.

As for the staff, they couldn’t have made our time in the hotel any more enjoyable.  Everyone was polite and courteous, but above all they were just so eager to help, ranging from purchasing tickets for local attractions, advice on local restaurants and even printing our boarding passes, nothing seemed to much trouble and all done with a smile.  I particularly enjoyed coming back to our room in the evening to find our slippers and dressing gowns neatly laid out next to the bed ready to slip in to.

If the above isn’t enough to convince you to book here, then the location will.  The hotel sits just on the corner of the best shopping area in Barcelona, and is also just a 20 minute walk  from Sagrada Familia, a must see if you are visiting Barcelona for the first time.  There are also plenty of excellent eateries within metres of the hotels front door. 

I could probably waffle on for ages but twill leave it there.  Suffice it to say that when we return to Barcelona we will be staying at the Alma.",5,2013,06,24
40,Excellent,"Hotel Alma fulfilled whole our expectation. Service is very good, whole staff is kind and attentive. Front desc was always ready to help with services or suggestion about restaurants. Breakfast was also first class. Rooms are comfortable, completely equipped. Beds are also very good. Windows are soundproof, we head room facing street, but there was no any sounds from outside. Design of the hotel is impressive in main opinion, I liked it very much. Location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and sightseeing. I am looking forward to stay again in Alma Barcelona hotel.",5,2013,06,24
40,Amazing hotel in Barcelona,"My family and I traveled to Barcelona after staying at the Westin Palace in Madrid, Alfonso XIII in Sevilla and the  Hospes de Los Patos in Granada.  We had originally made reservations at the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona.  As my wife and I traveled with our two teenage daughters, we stayed in two rooms during our entire trip.  I looked for a less costly alternative in Barcelona, and after reading the reviews of the Hotel Alma, and seeing the photos, I reserved two connecting adjoining Executive Suites.  The service upon arrival was amazing.  The keyless entry using your fingerprints fascinated our daughters.  The free wifi and minibar (no snacks but a good supply of sodas and beer) was a welcome change from the other hotels.  Breakfast was not included but the quality and variety of the food for 25Euros/person was very reasonable.  The bathroom shower was amazing.  The bed and duvet were a dream. My wife commented that it was the most comfortable bed she has slept in in a hotel, and we have stayed in many five star hotels.  The decor is modern, simplistic and well thought out.  Two flat screens tics  in each room. The rooms were a bit dark but they were spotless.  The location is footsteps away from the finest shopping in Barcelona. Louis Vitton, Gucci, Chanel are example of stores right around the corner.  The hotel is not well known so keep the address written down when you want to return via taxi. The gym was TINY.  The only free weights they had was one set of adjustable barbells.  There was one treadmill and one bike.  There was no Universal or Nautilus type weights.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and recommend it highly.",5,2013,06,24
40,Elegant quiet hotel,"We spent 4 nights at the Alma, which is very well located just off Passag de Greica, in a lovely area of Barcelona, everything in walking distance, like the Gaudi buildings, shops and restaurants. From the moment we arrived we were happy, pleasant reception staff, elegant minimal styled decor in the public areas, and a large luxurious room. It was on the 5th floor (514), very quiet although it overlooked Mallorca street. We enjoyed the free minibar, the good toiletries and comfortable bed with good bed linen. Alma was an excellent choice. Loved the fingertip recognition to access your room.",5,2013,06,23
40,"ALMA Barcelona hotel, quaint and quiet","Just got back from anniversary vacation in Europe. Stayed at ALMA Barcelona hotel and had a wonderful stay. Hotel is just as pictures describe. Front desk, Sari, and the other young lady from Italy,were more than helpful. Near trains, popular tapas locations and walking distance to museums. Has 5 star appeal with quaint area in back to relax in the quietness of the location. Room was great with comfortable beds. Would stay here again.",5,2013,06,22
40,Very Nice,"We really enjoyed our stay here. 
The price was slightly high but the quality of the hotel and friendliness of staff certainly made up for it. 
Our room was quite minimal, which we liked. Quality bed, sofa, table only what was needed with ample cupboard space. 
The location was good. Right near all the high end fashion stores. Close to the subway and near enough to wherever you need to be. 
The only cons were the slow lift and bare gym. Nothing worth not staying here for. 
Thanks to all the friendly and helpful staff. They definitely went out of their way to help and accommodate us. ",4,2013,06,22
40,5 star experience,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband.  All of the positive reviews I read about this hotel has proven to be true, and I'm glad I selected Alma Barcelona. What impressed me most is the standard of service they provided us. They made us feel like we were their only guests and I know the hotel was full during our stay.  I have to comment about the amazing job the cleaning staff has done daily in cleaning our room.  It was just exceptional.  

I loved the central location of this hotel as it allowed us walk to all the main sights.  We enjoyed the contemporary spa like feel when in the lobby area, It was soothing and welcoming.  We liked the convenience of the keyless entry. We enjoyed our very comfortable room and appreciated our free drinks, like sodas and juices replenished daily.  Free Wifi we learned is not common in Spain so we loved it that it was no extra charge in Alma Barcelona and access was a non issue.

I do have a couple of items I feel need improvement.  I would have preferred one large goose down blanket for my husband and I to share.  We had two separate blankets and although it was very soft and comfortable, it is not for couples, at least not for us.  Maybe the hotel should make this an option for guests?  Another issue for me is that we were not provided face towels and I would have liked to have more bath towels in our bathroom.  

Overall Alma Barcelona is a great hotel.",5,2013,06,22
40,Excellent....!,"5 - Star for superb Staff!
5 - Star for comfort, simplicity, serenity and design!

Alma is a new Hotel in Barcelona - most Taxi drivers don't know the Hotel so
keep the Address handy ""Mallorca 271"".

The Alma is not your typical / traditional 5 Star Hotel. After walking the buzzling / loud 
streets of Barcelona it feels very calm and refreshing entering the Hotel.

Rooms are very spacious for European standards with large Bathroom. Most comfortable Beds!

Besides the excellent Hotel Restaurant you must try ""Botafumeiro"" (10 min walk from Alma).
Traditional Restaurant with the most delicious food and service!",5,2013,06,21
40,Close to perfect,"Centrally located on Calle Mallorca is Hotel Alma. At first it feels a bit «off», but then you realize that it is perfectly located. More than perfect actually. 

It is a nice welcome at arrival in the reception. Everybody smiles at you. In the daytime; that is. You will be meet with a delicate reception area and a lovely backyard. 

My traveling friend - who has worked with hotels for 15 years - was also quite happy with the experience. The whole concept is together and works so well. 

The rooms are relatively small; but impeccable style. Clean. Attractive products in the bathroom, and mini bar that is complimentary. 

The Barcelona-air fills the great room and I had a great and relaxing time there. 

I find the price to be decent for what they deliver. 25 euros for breakfast is the same as in Oslo. It should be enjoyed in the backyard of the lovely music and the total packaged is worth it. 

The waiters were professional and especially the Czech girl. Nice conversations. 

I did not use the gym, and or eating dinner. The fingerprint system is also an excellent idea. 

The only little thing that is minor is the service from the night guards. It were a little unexpected from a 5 star. Anyway; clearly a favorite in Barcelona for me.",5,2013,06,21
40,Outstanding,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at around the world.  Ambiance overall is outstanding.  Impeccable decor, lighting, design.  Exceptionally clean.  Front desk service was so friendly, efficient and helpful.  Our room was very clean, modern, stylish and comfortable.  Very spacious...I can't recall the type of room but it had a large sleeping area separated by a large unit containing TV, minibar, safe, closet space, etc. from a small sitting area.  The room was on the street side facing the Carrer Majorca but the shutters and windows provided for a very quiet and dark sleep environment.  The bathroom was large, bright and very comfortable.  Large walk in shower, two sinks, great toiletries, private toilet, large tub.  We didn't eat at the restaurant but enjoyed the outdoor patio for cocktails twice and had great service and a great mojito.  The location is perfect...just a few steps from P de Gracias but not in the middle of La Rambla.  The Gaudi La Pedrera is literally around the corner and the Diagonal metro station (and Starbucks) is a 10 minute or less walk.  

This was a great place.  Open one in New York please!  It compares to Trump Soho, Andaz as a contemporary 5 star style hotel.  I hope to be back someday.",5,2013,06,19
40,"Modern, Comfortable","I stayed at the Alma, Barcelona hotel and would recommend the hotel for its large, and very comfortable rooms. The fingerprint system is also an excellent idea. The check in process was very slow and not sure why. I would recommend this hotel with no doubt , I have stayed at both the Alma hotel and the Casa Camper hotel and both are excellent. The position of the Alma hotel,is also excellent. The only downside of the Alma hotel was its service in the bar and restaurant area, they have a lovely garden outside but the service was always slow, I had a continental breakfast there only once as I found to go out was far cheaper and better.

Altogether an excellent hotel.",4,2013,06,16
40,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Alma from May 30 through June 7 and we had a wonderful time here. The hotel is not a boutique hotel. It has over 60 rooms, but it is in general a small hotel which is great. Just to clarify, in my opinion, if you have over 20 rooms, your property is simply not a boutique hotel.

The check inn process was good, we were offered a glass of Cava which was a very nice touch. The process was fast except for the fingerprint process.... Our room on the 6th floor was spacious and very well appointed. The fact that it had two showers was a nice plus.  Now about the fingerprint access to rooms and spa.... for my wife it worked like a charm.... for me i almost every time had to try 4 or 5 times before I was able to open the room.... not that much of a problem, but not a perfect system.

The food at the hotel restaurant was actually quite good, and the outside terrace was amazing, specially during the last days of our stay in which the weather got a little warmer. We actually dined twice at the hotel and both days the food was extremely good.  They had a bar, but the Margarita was nothing special. The Bartender actually had to call someone and ask where the Tequila was kept and had no idea which tequila they used to make margaritas. 

Now, some things to improve: When you have over 60 rooms and only 2 front desk terminals it is quite easy to have to wait in order to ask the most simple of questions, specially because the front desk staff doubles as concierge, so if you have two parties checkin in and you need to reserve a restaurant you might have to wait a while. It didn't happened to us in particular but going in and out of the hotel I saw people waiting for the front desk to be available.

The one thing that I found unacceptable was the fact that there was NO COMPUTER AVAILABLE FOR GUESTS ANYWHERE IN THE HOTEL. They offered the ones in the front desk, but whatever you might need to do, from checking your email or printing a boarding pass you are going to have to do it with the front desk personnel by your side. On 2013, that is just unacceptable for a 5 star hotel and there is no way to deny it or sugarcoat it. They just need to find a place in the very ample dinning room to put an imac (which would actually look great with the hotel decoration) and a PRINTER......

Now the hotel help us with a car reservation and the service was amazing. The people from the rental company brought the car to us in the hotel, the hotel help us parking the car at night and the people from the car company picked up the car at the hotel the next day and we didn't even have to wake up to return the car. Great service.

The fact that the minibar is included (water - beer - cold drinks, - No alcohol) was actually great. All hotels should do the same.

The pool in the basement was a very nice touch specially after a day of walking around Barcelona, it was nice to get to the pool and just relax and maybe use the Sauna.

The room was very spacious, very nice bed, turndown service every day, nice towels etc... great service. 

The hotel staff was extremely helpful, very attentive to anything we might need.  

The checkout was very efficient and fast.

The location of the hotel is actually priceless. You are just a couple of steps from Passeig de Gracia, and walking distance from almost everything, even the Sagrada Familia, which is just a short walk in  a straight line at Mallorca street

Overall the hotel was very good, great service, great pool for relaxing after a busy day, but they need to have either a separate concierge or an extra spot at the reception desk and they need to have a computer with printer for guests available 24/7 and not only when the ones used by the receptions staff are not being used.",5,2013,06,15
40,"Very Modern, loved the fingerprint room key","We stayed at Alma Barcelona with our 9 year old son between 10-13 June in an Executive Suite. We stayed at the AlmaSevilla the three nights previous - that was a large room, but the Barcelona room made even it look small. Much larger than internet pictures of the same room would suggest. This room type is the size of a large 1 bedroom apartment with a separate lounge room that also housed separate sleeping for our son (not just a sofa bed).

The hotel is beautiful, modern clean rooms, extremely friendly staff, interesting common areas and an ingenious finger print based room-key system so you don't need to carry a key/card for the room. Very convenient. The decor is minimalist (depends if that's your taste as to whether you will enjoy that), and is very dark both in corridors, and rooms - we stayed in 413. Like other Alma hotels, these beds are simply perfect. Where do I get one? You will want to take the bed with you when you leave.

The swimming pool is small but is about 15m long and can be used to swim laps. 

The location is safe (business district - not tourist), away from the pickpockets of Las Ramblas, with many dining options, but an absence of convenience stores we noticed. Everything else can be found easily.

Wi-FI was very fast and reliable. Air conditioning was very effective. Bvlgari soaps. Windows did not open which was strange given there was a balcony.

Thanks Alma Barcelona for great stay!",5,2013,06,15
40,"A great hoter, the suite however ...","Beautifully designed hotel, great staff and great location. However, large suite facing the street suffocating. Openings sealed, and you can not open them and ventilate the room. Only ventilation is the air conditioner. Therefore, there is a suffocating atmosphere, into which you get up in the morning and returning in the evening. In addition, transportation noise penetrates the room. Unfortunately, the food in the lobby at a low level, especially compared to what you can eat, and at reasonable prices, in the immediate vicinity.",4,2013,06,15
40,Thoroughly enjoyed ALMA,"After a few nights in W Barcelona we moved to Alma, so that we could stay around the Gothic quater. The hotel is off  Passeig de Gràcia and the hotel has Gucci, LV, Bottega Veneta and Ferragamo few meters from the hotel. The room is very comfortable, though we had an issue with the air conditioning on day 1. The Ac did not function at all and we had a disturbed sleep. The next day we moved to another room and from then on our stay was okay. Breakfast as very limited and felt it did not do justice for the price. The hotel is few blocks away from Casa Mila and other Gaudi sites. Fantastic location but give  amiss to the breakfast and dine in the small cafes and pastry shops which Barcelona is famous for.",4,2013,06,14
40,"nice hotel, nice part of town","we stayed in the Alma along with our two sons and their partners. The hotel was lovely and clean and fresh and all three rooms were top quality. We only stayed for one night prior to a cruise but one of my sons was there for three nights in all and he loved it.

Its in the more, shall we say, classy bit of town. North of the Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya. Quite close to La Pedrera and the designer shops.

The staff were very helpful and we found good restaurants for both a tapas lunch and a fancy dinner within close proximity.

we did not opt for breakfast at an additional 50 euros per couple and our only other gripe was that the toilet and bathroom were separate and there was no handwash basin in the toilet. 

But all in all a very nice hotel.",5,2013,06,13
40,Excellent hotel and a soothing oasis!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Alma hotel. It is a refined sophisticated hotel with a tranquil serene atmosphere. A  bonus was  a lovely interior garden where we could relax in one of the comfortable lounges and enjoy a drink or dinner after a busy day. The hotel decor is very design and minimalist which is soothing and Zen. The bedroom was spacious, with comfortable bedding  and with beautiful furniture and quality finishes. A lovely touch was the complimentary drinks in the mini bar. The staff was also excellent. Food at the restaurant was fresh and delicious. A top hotel and would stay there again.",5,2013,06,12
40,Amazing!,We were there for three nights in Spring. Upon arrival just got an unexpected upgrade! Rooms were clean and very nicely decorated. the interior is very modern and rooms are big. The spa is small but very clean. Staff is extremely helpful! They advised us with restaurants and bar and also gave us insider tips regarding good tapas bars. Go there and enjoy being treated like a king!!,5,2013,06,12
40,Service par excellence,"We recently stayed for three nights at the Alma Hotel in Barcelona. This is a modern place with beautiful accommodations, but what really set it apart was the level of service. As soon as we walked in the door we were provided with a glass of cava while we checked in. We consulted with the front desk daily, and were treated warmly each time. 

After two full days of walking Barcelona we looked forward to the peach and quite of our hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city. It is located relatively close to the Rambla and other attractions, and they will provide you with service par excellence.",5,2013,06,10
40,A five star hotel that deserves its accolades...,"We stayed at the Alma Barcelona whilst in Barcelona for a weekend visit. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in Spain including a few in Barcelona so will use those as a reference.

The building
We were initially surprised given that our taxi driver did not know where the hotel was although he passed by that area often. When we made it to the building we realized why; the building is very sober and there are no big hotel signs so you can easily pass by it without realizing that it is a hotel. Once inside things change quite a bit. You are quickly seated in a nice desk to make the check-in and as you wait you are offered cava or other refreshments. The decoration is very modern but in a good way (not IKEA-like but rather modern museum feel). There are some nice perks to the place like being able to use your finger-print to open your door or the fact that you get free internet (make sure you restart your apple devices as there seems to be some sort of issue with apple and their internet - once rebooted everything works fine though)

Location
The building is located in the nicer part of Barcelona. Right by high-end stores and walking distance from the Sagrada Familia. Nothing to say here.

The rooms
Very nice and elegant rooms following the same sort of decor as the reception area. Big TV, comfortable bed and nice bathroom toiletries (what seemed to be a hotel brand but the nice kind). Large closets, nice shower with a big shower head (rain-like). The AC worked very well and was very silent. So no complaints overall.

The spa and gym
It seems like these days all hotels need a spa to be considered a 5 star. This is not a spa hotel...but they have a small but reasonable spa area. Masseuses are asked to come in for specific appointments so make sure to make yours in advance. The actual service is quite nice although the massage room is a bit basic. There are also a couple of small saunas (dry and humid) and a funny pool (only about 50cm deep so don't expect to swim a lot). There is a small gym with a few machines (i.e. a stationary bike and a couple of other machines). Not a great gym but should do the trick for most people.

Some tips:
- If you need a cab make sure to order it in advance - you can typically get one on the street if you are not in a hurry but if you actually NEED one you should know that ordering one in the hotel takes a good 10-15 minutes
- The breakfast is expensive (35 euros I believe) - in the end we went to the Pain Quotidien which is a couple of blocks away; I can't speak to the quality of the breakfast since we prefered to get our cereal and yogurt outside the hotel
- The hotel will help you get restaurants...but I would suggest you book them yourself well in advance (and do your own research); the nice hotels are fully booked 1-2 weeks in advance (and the really nice ones even before that) so make sure you reserve your table well in advance if you are into fine or trendy cuisine
- If you need any special item (shaving cream, toothpaste) just get it on your way in (they are well stocked in the reception); they will gladly take it to your room but it might take a good 15-20 minutes (and the rooms only have soap and shampoo)",5,2013,06,09
40,"Stay in Alma hotel June 02-04,2013","We Stayed at the Alma for 2 nights in June 2013 on our return from a cruise.
The service was outstanding & all the staff were very helpful.  My wife needs 
help in climbing stairs & the staff always offered to take her up in the small 
elevator.
The concierge found us an excellent beach restaurant & got us vegetarian food
- not an easy task in Spain. We were always assisted in getting cabs & our luggage
Was handled.All restaurant recommendations were good!
Hotel is very centrally located & this made life easier.
The main complaint we had was the poor lighting in room as its a minimalist design!
The room & passage & corridor were too dark for us as we are seniors.
The hotel lobby restaurant & garden are very pleasing features.
Simple breakfast in room service could be improved by adding hot dishes..",5,2013,06,09
40,Fantastic Hotel in Barcelona,"I recently stayed at the Alma Hotel for 2 nights in Barcelona while on business, and I want to share what a fantastic hotel this is.  The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, the hotel is new, modern, and clean, and the restaurant food is delicious.  I loved my spacious, well-appointed room - what a treat after a long business trip.  The hotel is centrally located in a great area.  I will stay at the Alma every time I come to Barcelona.",5,2013,06,09
40,"Great location, efficient and friendly staff","My husband and I stayed atnthis hotel for 8 nights recently. The location is excellent, a block away from Gaudi's La Pedrera, 15 mins walk to La Sangrada Familia, and situated between two metro stations. Shops and restaurants are within easy walking distance too.  The hotel staff were friendly and efficient from the moment you arrive you are offered somethingnto drink.  The fingerprint scan to enter your room was a fun novelty.  Complimentary wifi and mini bar were appreciated. Only small complaints were the pillows were much too soft and the swimming pool is so shallow that when you do ""freestyle"" you can touch the bottom of the pool. Location of the pool in the basement seems like it was an afterthought rather than a feature of the hotel.",4,2013,06,08
40,Lovely hotel and staff,We stayed at the Alma for one night at the ending of our honeymoon in Spain.  The staff could not have been any more helpful and the hotel was lovely and in an excellent location.  The garden at the rear of the hotel was a lovely quiet oasis in which to enjoy a drink and we loved the fingerprint entry!  It was just a shame that we had only booked one night as it didn't really leave us time to enjoy the spa....we'll be back!,5,2013,06,08
40,Absolutely Wonderful,"It has taken me a few weeks to get to this review, because I wanted it to be right.

We had a wonderful stay at the Alma Hotel, Barcelona.  My wife arrived a day ahead of me as a result of a plane cancellation during my trip.  The staff at the hotel were so gracious when I called to leave a message that I would be delayed; and were so supportive and helpful to my wife who suddenly and unexpectedly found herself arriving on her own in a new city.  While every staff person we dealt with was excellent, we have to single out Marcos, and Sammy from the hotel restaurant, who were beyond exemplary.  

Our room was spacious, clean, modern and ""cool"", with a view of the chimney pots of Gaudi's La Pedrera (Casa Milá).  Nothing says Barcelona like Gaudi.  While the room overall was great, the shower in particular deserves mention as it was huge and awesome.

The location in central Barcelona just off the Passeig de Gracia was perfect for us:  just close enough to the Ramblas and Barri Gótico that they are accessible, but in the elegant Eixample area, about a 20 minute walk to Sagrada Familia.   Marcos provided helpful advice and good restaurant recommendations, and all the staff were pleasant and genuine, and this contributed hugely to our very positive experience at the hotel.  

Top notch in so many ways.  

Definitely a hotel we would return to and recommend, if we were ever in the fortunate position of having a chance to get back to Barcelona.",5,2013,06,07
40,"Beautiful hotel, perfect staff","We stayed at the Alma for 5 nights to visit Barcelona for the first time. When we arrived (Alma organized the perfect airport transfer) we were welcomed by the very friendly and efficient staff. The Grand Deluxe Room with view over the garden met exactly our requirements: modern, quiet, spacious, a perfect bed, bathroom with shower and bath and mineral water;my husband liked the lounge chair very much. The location is great and very central.",5,2013,06,07
40,Amongst the best service and friendliest staff we have had,"Arrived in Barcelona and had booked this on the basis of trip advisor reviews, so was fairly comfortable about what to expect. Welcomed wamly with a flute of Cava, check in process smooth. Our room was spacious with an excellent bathroom size and lovely street view. Plenty of storage, furnishings good. Service was consistently excellent, from restaurant recommendations, advice about cafes, tours, tourist sights, opening doors and generally being available - in many instances the staff put that extra effort in to assist and did it with pleasure. Did not appreciate the location until after we arrived but was right near a street with lots of shopping (Passeig de Gracia), 15 minutes walk from La Sagrada Familia, 3-5 from La Pedrera and 5-7 from Casa Batlo, 12-15 from Placa Catalunya. Bus lines, metro all nearby, about 30 minutes from airport which came to 25 euro on the way in after 9 am and 35 on the way out about 7am. Pool downstairs with steam room, sauna, and adjacent room with treadmills. Garden settings outside make you feel like you are not in the city centre. Given the abundance of restaurants, did not eat in but the waiters were friendly qnd helpful, for example when offering and coming up to our room to open a bottle of wine (next time pack a corkscrew!) which after opening was not very good, then the next day assisting in recommending local wines. It has been many yeqrs since we felt this welcomed in a hotel and I would certainly stay there again.",5,2013,06,06
40,great,"One was smaller than the other, but both we same price and ""like new"" condition. Overall experience is of a good quality hotel - adequate furniture, no extra smells, no problem in the bathroom, beds are nice, perfect service!",5,2013,06,04
40,Alma-MM,"This was a wonderful hotel - right in the heart of the shopping and restaurant district in Barcelona.
The staff of the hotel couldn't do enough for us.  The service was very good.  There was no room key.  They somehow just ""programmed"" your index finger, and that was all you needed to open the door to your room.",4,2013,06,02
40,Stylish stay,"Although arriving unexpectedly early and having to wait for a room, the service and facilities at the Alma could not be faulted. On arrival you have the option of selecting traditional room keys or access via fingerprint. A bit James Bond and fun, the fingerprint entry meant we didn't have to worry about carrying room keys. The suites we had both faced the street and were extremely spacious and quiet. I had an enormous corner room with two floor to ceiling windows, sitting room, king sized bed, fully equipped bathroom with Bulgari toiletries and luxurious deep bath and separate rain shower, two flat screen TVs and free minibar. The hotel has wonderful original artworks and the outdoor garden is a tranquil oasis and perfect spot for a cocktail after walking the streets of Barcelona.",5,2013,05,31
40,Pefection in Barcelona!,"Stayed here for 4 nights in an ""executive suite"" on the 4th floor.  Very cool hotel.  Friendly welcoming staff.  Spacious room and public areas.  Beautiful courtyard.  Our room had a separate sitting area and had very high ceilings - very airy.  Large bath with separate tub, shower and WC.  Two smallish cupboards for storing clothes plus open shelves that were located below the television - these were difficult to access, pull out drawers or shelves would have been better.  Hotel is in an excellent location - we could walk to the  La Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas, the waterfront and old quarter.  Gaudi's  Casa Mila and Casa Batllo were just around the corner and up or down the street.  Lots of shopping, bars and restaurants close by. Would return in heartbeat!",5,2013,05,30
40,Fantastic hotel,"Great location, helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms. Bar food good and not too expensive considering it's a five star hotel.  Complimentary wifi and mini bar are nice touches and the fingerprint recognition system great fun. Pool small but my kids loved it. Would come back.",5,2013,05,30
40,Excellent Hotel in Superb Top market location,"Located in a high end shopping area. Round the corners are LV, Chanel, Cartier, Gucci, Prada etc shops. Also many wonderful Tapas eateries and cafe, Plus a few historic landmarks within the walking distance. The hotel rooms are big and tastefully decorated. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. 

A truly wonderful experience to stay in this hotel. Highly recommended. We will definitely stay in this Hotel during our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2013,05,29
40,Perfect hotel for a Barcelona stay,"We stayed at the Alma hotel for a long weekend as part of a City break and to watch the Formula 1 race on the Sunday.  It is very close walking distance from the Passeig de Gracia train station.  We decided to get the train from the airport 3.50 euros each, cannot recommend this enough, the trains run every 30 mins and even though this was our first experience of Barcelona it was a very easy journey.  When we came out of the Passeig de Gracia station there was even an info man who directed us in the direction of the Alma hotel.

On arriving at the hotel the staff were very welcoming and we enjoyed our complementary glass of champagne and had our finger prints taken for our room key (this was brilliant as we did not need a key for the room).  They also then showed us the location of the hotel on a map which they provided us with and marked out the popular destinations.  We also asked for a recommendation for a restaurant, we were given three options and then they called to reserve us a table.  The food was fantastic at this restaurant...  We again had recommendations on Saturday and Sunday and all restaurants were very good.

For the formula 1 we again took the train to the station next to the circuit, this again was very easy.  We have been to a few of the f1 circuits and it was one of the easiest to get to.

The bar at the Alma was very welcoming, we had a drink here in the evening, the bar staff are very friendly.

We would certainly return to the Alma hotel.  Everyone spoke good English and we were made to very welcome throughout our stay. Thank you for a lovely weekend stay.",5,2013,05,28
40,Original and stylish hotel,"I stayed at the hotel Alma for 4 days with my parents in Barcelona this May. The placement is ideal in the middle of a nice district with plenty of shops around. The staff were really great, and the room (we requested 2 extra lights) was beautiful and classy, though not very well lit. The mini bar is FREE which is the first time I have seen that ever, and is stocked with mini waters, juice, and beer, refilled daily. Free internet. The bathroom was very clean, white, and well lit with beautiful disappearing drains at the edge of the shower. I slept in a rollaway bed which was comfortable. 

There is a spa with a long lap pool and a sauna and a workout room. The water had a bit too much chlorene, and the room above is not pretty. We ate lunch at the restaurant and it was great. Vegetable tempura, ham upon reuest, salad etc. Breakfast in the room was great. But the BEST part of the hotel is the digital fingerprint key cards! Your print is taken upon arrival and you use your finger to enter your room. I was opening the door just for fun...",4,2013,05,28
40,A very special hotel!!,"I have stayed in many hotels but this one is something special!  When we arrived we were very warmly met by staff that actually knew our names. Check in very efficient and informative, we were offered a drink which was an added bonus and as it happened to be my birthday the glass of cava was much appreciated!! The hotel is sleek and modern and very clean as was our bedroom..beautiful bathroom with huge shower and plentiful storage in the bedroom. All staff were professional, efficient and very friendly. I hope to stay at this hotel again and would have no hesitation in recommending it to my friends. Stay at this hotel and you will not be disappointed. Breakfast is a little expensive but the quality, choice and presentation is amazing!!",5,2013,05,28
40,"Great service, but...........","My husband and i along with our 16 year old daughter, booked a short 3 night break  at the Barcelona Alma as a family 'treat'. The plan was to book a premium rated hotel, in a great location where we could enjoy the luxury of some spa treatments to break up the sight seeing etc. Whilst we could not in any way fault the service of the staff there who went out of their way to help us, we did feel that it lacked 'something'. Perhaps the minimalist style of the hotel contributed to the feeling that it lacked luxury and was perhaps a little sterile i.e. no warmth in the bar/restaurant area, the minmal facilities around the pool area etc. It may be a matter of our personal taste but we prefer hotels with more of an upbeat feel and certainly not one so very dark as the Alma was.Atmospheric is one thing, darkness is gloomy!  Superb staff but we thought that they are let down by the building itself",3,2013,05,28
40,Room with a Gaudi View,"You know you are off to a good start in a hotel when you are welcomed with a valet who comes out quickly on a busy street and gets your bags and car keys while at the same time the front desk is pouring you a sparkling Cava and checking you in.  When you open your room door 15 short minutes later, you are greeted with a view of a courtyard below and the fantastic ""heads"" on the nearby Casa Mila above.  The modern wood floors, large feather beds and separate WC and clean, spacious bathroom with a wonderful tub and multi head shower made this entire experience fabulous.  The hotel is perfectly situated to walk everywhere.  We were able to walk to Barcelonetta, the Barri Gotic, La Boquera and Las Ramblas, Eixample, the Sagadra Familla and to the funicular up to Montjuic.  LIke I said, walking distance to all-the only cab ride we took was to Parc Guell, and we were able to walk back from there.  The staff is exceptional, friendly and interested in helping you with restaurants, attractions, tickets, transportation, whatever you need.  The price of the room is far offset by what you are able to do and see while vacationing in beautiful Barcelona.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2013,05,28
40,Incredible Staff & Awesome Hotel,"Our companion travelers picked this hotel after much research and we went with their recommendation.  From the minute we walked in and greeted by one of the most professional staffs I have experience, I knew the choice was the right one. The staff was very helpful with recommendations (which were all spot on) for dining and touring. Management is to be praised for such an awesome staff.  Cannot thank them enough for making us feel at home, their hospitality and their genuine concern that we have a great stay.

Have to admit I love that your finger print is your room key so there is never the worry about losing the key or locking yourself out. The hotel design is modern and to our liking.  The location is near shops, restaurants, cafes and transportation.  Wireless and the minibar was included. On our return to Barcelona this will be the ONLY hotel of our choice. Have already recommended it to our friends.",5,2013,05,28
40,Superb quiet oasis in the heart of Barcelona,A beautiful quiet oasis in the heart of Barcelona. Incredibly attentive and knowledgeable staff. Beautiful open room. (note that the bathroom is partitioned  but not closed off). We were on the 6 th floor facing the courtyard (quiet!) with a view of the roof of La pedrera.  Lovely sitting area downstairs with inside outside options. Fabulous breakfast! A great value 5 star option highly recommended.,5,2013,05,27
40,Wonderful!,"All I can say is wonderful!
This hotel was exactly as we hoped it would be. Central and beautiful. 
There was a wealth of things to do and see, and the comfort we enjoyed simply leaves us wanting more. 

The staff was polite and and friendly, and we especially enjoyed the food on offer. 

We can not wait to come back again!",5,2013,05,26
40,A Wonderful Stay,"We stayed at the Alma for 3 nights in late April and cannot speak too highly of the hotel or the wonderful staff . We had a room overlooking the leafy courtyard and , even though we were in the middle of a city , it was very quiet . Though all the staff were impressive , we would like to make special mention of Saray on reception who was so pleasant and helpful . She booked 2 excellent tapas restaurants for us and was always ready to help .
The hotel is in a great position and we were very happy with our choice . We highly recommend The Alma Barcelona .
If coming in by taxi make sure you have the name and address written out for the driver as the entrance is so discreet that many taxi drivers do not know it .",5,2013,05,26
40,Perfect,"A perfect hotel to explore Barcelona. It is walking distance to all sites, close to the metro if you're feeling lazy but you really can walk everywhere from here. 

Incredibly helpful staff who make you feel like nothing is a problem - keen to offer advise on places to go, and flawlessly arrange/book anything for you if you ask.

The rooms were lovely - definitely made for couples in their layout. Wouldn't recommend staying with a friend or business partner due to the fairly open plan of the shower! But it is beautiful and comfortable.

I can't comment on food or drink in the hotel as we ate out every day. 25 euros for breakfast seems a little steep, when you can buy nice coffee & a pastry for just a couple of euros outside. There are plenty of coffee shops/restaurants/bars nearby so it's no trouble at all to find somewhere to grab something to eat or drink, but there were lots of people eating breakfast in the hotel everyday so I imagine the food is good.

The spa is a nice touch - includes a steam room, sauna and small swimming pool (more of a spa pool than an actual pool), and some lovely showers. 

The fitness room is very small - a bike and a treadmill and some weights, but that's about it. Enough to keep you healthy but there is no ventilation in the gym so you do get very hot very quickly!

All in all a wonderful hotel - no complaints. Would definitely recommend.",5,2013,05,26
40,Modern hotel in the Eixample,"The Alma is a modern hotel set in the classy Eixample Barcelona area.  The hotel is close to both train and Metro transportation with the Passig de Gracia stations 5 short blocks away.  The Grand Deluxe rooms are well appointed with comfy beds, big windows, a desk and lounge chair.  Some may find the fact that the glass door shower faces out into the room strange, however, there is a room divider between the shower/sink area and the rest of the room.  Not a place to have your coworkers wait while you grab a quick shower though.  Lots of storage.  Very quiet.  International staff who where most helpful and always polite and professional.  The only negative may be the lighting.  The room light switches were difficult to figure out and the bathroom lighting was not sufficient for makeup application.",5,2013,05,24
40,Stylish,"We just spent 3 nights here post Mediterranean cruise.  What a cool hotel and appropriately stylish for the city of Barcelona.  We had booked an executive suite and were pleasantly surprised to find the suite even larger than expected -- probably 600 square feet or so!  The king sized bed was exceptionally comfortable with individual duvets for my wife and I.  There was a HiDef TV in the bedroom area and a separate HiDef TV in the sitting area.  The bathroom was exceptionally large in tiled in white marble.  Although there was no bathtub, the rainshower was very large and we enjoyed the Bulgari toiletries that were provided.  The complimentary mini bar was a nice touch.  One thing to note is that the lighting and colour scheme throughout the hotel is designed to maximize the design quotient versus pure practicality -- the Alma Barcelona definitely does not have the sensibility of a chain hotel!  Although we did not try the breakfast at the hotel's restaurant (there were too many excellent restaurant options throughout Barcelona), it looked delicious (buffet of Iberian ham and other charcuterie, cheese, coffee, various pastries etc.)  One comment is that the spa and swimming facilities in the basement are very beautifully designed from an architectural perspective, they are small in scale.  I enjoy swimming, but the pool looked to small for a proper swim.",5,2013,05,21
40,Fantastic!,"Spent 4 nights here at the start of May, and it was everything that we expected based on the reviews i'd read prior to booking.  Although the location was very central, it was very quiet and relaxing.  The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly, everyhting was perfect.  As it was so central, and close to many bars and restaurants, we did not have the chance to eat in the hotel itself, therefore can't comment on the prices",5,2013,05,17
40,Modern hotel in central location,"We stayed here for 2 nights pre cruise. As others have said, the reception staff are most helpful.
The gratis water in the mini bar is a nice touch to-gether with the other beverages.
The bar was not as as warm and comfortable as we would like so we only used it once.
There are lots of breakfast places close by and yes it really is central.
Would definitely return",4,2013,05,16
40,"Beautiful hotel, great location and a fantastic team!","We have just returned from a weeks holiday in Barcelona and stayed in the Alma for the first three nights. The hotel is really lovely, its modern and spacious and the location couldn't be better, just off the Passeig de Gracia, so there are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance.

The best thing about the hotel has to be the staff who are wonderful. From the cava at check in to their tips on the best places to eat and visit, they really go out of their way to make your stay perfect. 

The rooms at the Alma are very large and spacious with amazingly comfortable beds and a large walk in shower. 

The hotel itself is very clean and has a very pleasant feel. Most evenings we would return to the bar after dinner as the cocktails and desserts are amazing! I highly recommend the chocolate fondant!

Overall I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again if I visit Barcelona again.",5,2013,05,15
40,The best front desk team,"I spent three nights here with the aim of watching the Grand Prix, spending time on the beach, visiting cathedrals, enjoying some nice meals and generally meandering about.  If you want to do a bit of everything in Barcelona this is a great location and the front desk couldn't be more helpful.  They aren't just helpful but make you feel comfortable asking for help and advice and seem to set the right tone with a wide variety of guests. Great place.",5,2013,05,14
40,Can't believe this hotel is not listed in the major guidebooks,"I discovered this hotel on tripadvisor, which is always the first place I look to find places which add tremendously to our travel experiences. The Alma was perfect for us! The staff could not have been nicer...their manner was always friendly and helpful but never too much so that you sensed a certain artificiality. The location is excellent...easy access to a metro line that goes to all the major sites yet in a neighborhood which is gorgeous and just enough removed from the crowds. While we were there it rained but we could walk to the Gaudi houses and some wonderful restaurants. I loved the contemporary clean lines of our room...we were in a suite and couldn't believe how large it was ! We stayed three nights and could not have been more satisfied !",5,2013,05,13
40,Can't imagine a better place to stay in Barcelona,"We stayed here for 5 nights in May 2013, and could not have enjoyed our stay more.  Although the hotel is in the northern part of L'Eixample, it's in a good location right off of Passeig de Gracia.  Walking is easy to do in Barcelona, but if you're tired/need to go longer distances, the metro is very convenient.  The place is very modern and stylish, from the sign on the door right down to very detail in the rooms.

We stayed in a Grand Deluxe room, which was extremely large by European standards (a king size bed that seems small in that room).  Shower and bathroom were very nice.  The bathroom area is pretty much wide open to the room, though, so you could be disturbed if your spouse or partner wanted to shower while you slept.  It's a very quiet place overall...our room opened into the courtyard, which I'm guessing was (much) quieter than the rooms facing the street.

We didn't have any meals at the hotel (too many other good options in the neighborhood), but had a drink in the lovely, tree-filled courtyard.

Beyond all that, the staff here was AMAZING.  They helped make reservations (with great recommendations), got us tickets for museums and other attractions in advance, and generally made life easy for us...all while seeming to really enjoy their jobs.  Some of the best service I have ever seen.

Overall, this was a great experience:  wonderful, large room, excellent location, and unparalleled service...all at a pretty reasonable price in my opinion.",5,2013,05,13
40,Soooo Cool!,"This is a lovely hotel in a great location! Do not hesitate to stay here if you are looking for a relaxing, peaceful, modern, and friendly place. We had a room that overlooked a central courtyard and views of a Gaudi-designed building. Very romantic!",5,2013,05,12
40,Amazing stay in a really convenient location,"We actually stayed here February 2012, over a year ago, but I forgot to add this to the review.  But this hotel has been one of my favourite stays in Europe.  Not only is it modern, and for a 5 star hotel, is great value in a European city.  But the detail is so simple, elegant and modern.  The bathroom is very spacious, and the best thing - your finger holds the key to your door! Yes, that's right, modern technology that only allows you to enter the room if you have the right fingerprint! Would definitely stay here again, as the location is fantastic! You've got the Gaudi apartment around the corner, the shops along the boulevard.  Highly recommended!",5,2013,05,10
40,The place to stay in Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed 4 nights at Alma. What a fantastic hotel. Everyone was extremely helpful, anything we needed was taken care of. The location is central to just about anything and if you're not walking there, cabs are easy to get from the hotel. 
I took advantage of the steam and dry saunas as we walked quite a bit and I found it was a great way to unwind before getting ready for dinner. There isn't much to the gym, a treadmill and a stationary bike but the spa was well stocked with towels and robes and extremely clean.
We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as it seemed a little expensive and there are loads of great pastry shops within a few block radius so we grabbed coffee and a pastry locally.
The rooms are amazing. Plenty of space and loads of storage. Minimalist and clean but with every comfort you could imagine. The bed was so comfortable. 
I would definitely stay here again and I would highly recommend it.",5,2013,05,08
40,Excellent,We stayed for three nights in April-May and was very happy about everything. Nice garden. Great staff. They gave great recommendations on restaurants and sightseeing etc. Super comfy beds. Very well situated. Quite. We had an excellent stay.,5,2013,05,03
40,Fabulous hotel in a great location,Amazing 3 nights at Alma Barcelona - beautifully designed hotel in a great location.  Extremely professional and very friendly staff - a real gem and we look forward to coming back here and also to trying out the other Almas!,5,2013,05,03
40,What a great hotel!,"This is a beautiful modest size hotel with a real boutique feel in a great location.  While the physical structure is very attractive and the amenities are clearly upscale what made our 5 night visit so pleasant were the hotel staff.  They were consistency welcoming, helpful and appeared genuinely concerned regarding our experience both in the hotel and Barcelona at large.  We enjoyed our rain shower in the bathroom and the free minibar.  We also enjoyed breakfast in the hotel one morning and while it was priced as all luxury hotel meals are it was delicious and less expensive than other hotels we have visited.

The only area that could be improved from my perspective would be to have separate lighting for the bathroom area as our room overlooking the central courtyard the light switch for the bathroom also switched on a light in the hall which was a nuisance for my spouse.   

The quality of the staff was consistent both in Barcelona and during our 2 night stay in Seville which preceded our visit to Barcelona.  We will stay here again next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2013,05,01
40,A really nice place to stay,"We stayed at the Hotel Alma in late April. We thought it was a lovely five star hotel...with one reservation.
The hotel is extremely well located and away from the crazy crowds at La Rambla. But very importantly it is central to almost everything else. 
The staff are exceptional. From our arrival when we were seated and introduced to the hotel by Julio and we were shown to our room by Marcos we were treated royally. The bar and restaurant staff are first class. Javi, Lisa and especially Bergonia are all a treasure. A good hotel needs good staff and I hope management here knows how good the staff is they have.
The bar and restaurant are beautifully presented and very good value.
The room we had, 401, was excellent. It was quite large with a separate lounge and sitting area. The bathroom was without fault...just beautiful. Our only criticism is that these front rooms, which face the street, are very noisy. The traffic noise can be unbearable at times, even four floors up. Why, in the building of this hotel three years ago they didn't double glaze the windows is beyond belief. They spent a fortune on the rest of the hotel...but missed a vital issue. They claim they are at least double glazed but believe me you can hear people talking and yelling as they go by on the footpath overnight. They really need to fix this.
If you stay here, and I recommend you do, then make sure you have a room at the back. All in all an excellent place to stay.",5,2013,05,01
40,Minimalist but perfect,"Stayed in this hotel recently. The hotel has minimalist feel but the rooms are cool, very comfortable and quiet. The beds so comfortable best night sleep for a long time. Only one negative. The shower room. Whilst a great size the amount of water that goes on the floor apart from in the shower was a bit dangerous. 
Staff were very attentive and check in was very professional. It was a shame that the tapas bar that was recommended was such a bad choice.",4,2013,04,29
40,Short Stay in Barcelona,"This hotel is very central and is only a couple of years old. The service is not only friendly but very professional. Our double room had very comfortable beds and was quiet, facing the inner courtyard rather than the street in the front. I liked the fact that the mini bar was stocked free of charge (soft drinks and water only) - when I'm paying I don't like hotels that charge over the odds for every sip of water. Room service cleans the rooms according to guest timetables rather than their own - we tended to lie in late as we were on holiday. Wooden floors meant that the room not only appeared clean but was clean. The bathroom was modern with two basins, separate loo and large walk in shower none of which need a degree in modern plumbing to operate. All in all a highly recommended hotel.",5,2013,04,29
40,Boutique Excellence,"Just back from a 2 night stay in the Alma with my girlfriend and one thing is for sure it was a pleasure!

The Hotel has a very boutique feeling and the staff and service you get is exellent! All the staff were helpful with advice and guidance on the best places to pay a visit to in the city! 

The room was extremely comfortable with a stylish modern decor! Massive soft comfortable beds and a superb double shower room! 

Used the spa in the basement as well and it met all the needs, all be it is smaller there is still more than enough to keep you feeling healthy on a stay.

Overally i would highly recomend and when coming back to Barca i wouldnt look anywhere else!",5,2013,04,29
40,Fabulous,"From the moment we arrived we knew that we would not be disappointed! As the taxi approached, Marcos magically appeared & greeted us, whisking our bags inside. It took a few minutes to check in as we had arrived at a busy time but it was not really a problem & the glass of cava whilst we waited was most welcome! We opted for the finger printing instead of a traditional room key & encountered no problems with it. It was great not to have to search for the key before leaving the room!

The hotel was beautifully appointed & our suite was gorgeous & of a very high standard. The decor was lovely & obviously kept on top of with not a scratch or chip to be seen. We had booked with Mr & Mrs Smith & as members had a bottle of cava & some chocolates waiting in the room for us. This was a lovely touch & despite not being a huge chocolate fan I must admit that one of the chocolate options was out of this world!

After sprucing up in the wonderful, enormous bathroom filled with delicious bulgari  products we headed out for a bite to eat down at barceloneta. We were not out late as fairly pooped from a long day so were delighted to find that the enormous bed was one of the comfiest we have ever slept in.

The rest of our few days in Barcelona were fabulous but as this is a hotel review I shall not digress but simply state that the service we received at the Alma was outstanding. In particular, Marcos must be singled out as one of the most charming & helpful people we have ever met. When we realised that a restaurant booking we had made was at a restaurant that was closed the evening of my birthday Marcos did not hesitate to recommend another argentine restaurant & promptly make us a booking. (We had been slightly panicking as the night in question was San Jordi's day & thus a very popular night for restaurants!)

On the morning of my birthday a bottle of cava arrived together with a huge plate of the white chocolate macadamia & pistachio chocolates that I has been so enamoured with.....the staff had enquired as to which chef had been on duty the day we arrived & who had made them! It is touches like this when hotels really go the extra mile that make a guest feel special , & from start to finish the service we received at the Alma was excellent.

A beautiful, contemporary hotel in the middle of a fabulous city with genuinely caring & friendly staff...top marks to the Alma, we can't wait to return!",5,2013,04,29
40,"one word.....""wow""....","I’ve stayed at Alma hotel back in February and all I can say is “wow” very impressed.
This is a very chic luxury hotel. From the initial check in, the über professionalism of the staff was almost as overwhelming as high tech fingerprint scanning option instead of the use of a door key for your room. Boy! Big brother can surely be watching you in this place!
You are seamlessly ushered to your room where you are greeted by a very large well-appointed sleeping area. The bathroom has a wet room rainshower that could easily fit 3-4 people (should you so desire!), however, much to my disappointment, this function did not work for my 1 night stay, so I missed out on my luxury indulgence of a gorgeous rainshower.
The bar area was, again, pure chic. Low level lighting and service heaven. A comfortable outside area as well.
Truly a wonderful place to stay for business, pleasure or the romantic weekend away in the centre of a beautiful city location.
Big tick on the “WOW” factor……",5,2013,04,29
40,Simply the best hotel to stay at when in Barcelona,"From the moment we checked in to the moment checked out, the customer service at the Alma Barcelona is one of the best We ever experienced. The rooms are comfortable and spacious and the bed is so comfortable, you do not want to get up quickly in the morning. We ate at the onsite restaurant, the food was fabtastic and the service matched with the same excellence. It is rare for us to give so many accolades to one place, but I did not experience anything but the best quality at this hotel. It is a boutique hotel tucked away on Mallorca Street within walking distance of the best shopping and rstaurants.",5,2013,04,25
40,Hotel Alma,"The Hotel Alma was a wonderful choice. Four ladies on a trip to Barcelona. FIrstly it was in a great location just around the corner from La Pedrera and also one of the main shopping areas but it was very quiet away from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas.
The hotel had a garden courtyard which was wonderful to sit in for a mojito or  glass of cava!
The beds were truly comfortable.
However the best thing about this hotel was the staff - they were without exception extremely kind and helpful. They booked two restaurants for us which were both excellent and went out of their way to help us with our numerous questions!
When I return to Barcelona I would choose to stay here again and in fact I would stay in one of the sister hotels in Seville or Berlin if travelling there.",5,2013,04,25
40,"Stayed for four nights, but I could have stayed indefinitely!","I'm adding another glowing review of the Alma Hotel. We stayed there four nights, but I could have stayed indefinitely. From the moment we walked through the door and were greeted by the friendly staff and offered a glass of cava to the time we sadly left, our stay was outstanding.  The hotel and the rooms are gorgeous - very modern with an edgy, but comfortable atmosphere. The bathroom is incredible with a lovely shower. We were on the courtyard side with a nice view of the outside seating below and courtyards of adjacent buildings. The only downside to the rooms is that in addition to the much appreciated, free minibar with beverages, we would have really loved coffee in the room. With so many perks at this hotel, this one would seem easy to accomodate.
The staff was superb and helped us get advance tickets to tour some of the Gaudi buildings so we wouldn't have to stand in line as well as made some great breakfast and bar recommendations.  We didn't eat at the hotel, but had some drinks at the bar along with great conversations with a couple of different bartenders. We never had a chance to use the spa so I feel like I need to go back to to experience that!  
The location is perfect and we walked everywhere.  Casa Mila is right round the corner and Casa Batllo is just a few blocks away. We also walked to Sagrada Familia, La Rambla and even walked back from Parc Guell (although we took a taxi to get there). I will definitely stay at the Alma the next time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2013,04,23
40,Fabulous place to stay in heart of Barcelona,"Concur with almost everyone else's view of the Alma. Lovely place to stay, right in the heart of Barcelona - couldn't have wished for a better location on our first trip to the city. About 20 metres off the Passeig de Gracia, its a peaceful haven from the hussle and bussle nearby. Ideal for shopping, a short walk to the Sagrada Familia, and plenty of bars and restaurants close by. 

As almost everyone else has said, the check in is a pleasure rather than a chore, as in many hotels. We arrived early but our room was ready. Whilst checking in we were given a glass of Cava, and in terms of helping us get the most out of our stay they couldn't do enough. We had most things arranged within 10 minutes of arriving at the hotel. 

The reception staff throughout were fabulous. We ate lunch at the hotel on the first day and the food was lovely, with a decent wine selection priced very reasonably. The public areas are lovely, albeit quiet which might not be to everyone's liking. 

The rooms are excellent. We never had any problems with the keyless door entry, and in fact found it much better, not having to remember room keys, or to not put a key near a mobile phone! 

Rooms well equipped with an excellent shower, comfortable beds and as quiet as any room I've stayed in. Fitness room small but very functional and spa area was small but lovely - pool is more than adequate for getting some lengths in. 

Only (very) small downsides - no music system in rooms (other than radio through TV), and bar staff seemed slightly stretched at slightly busier times (and in one case not very helpful). However overall would love to go back and thoroughly recommend to all.",5,2013,04,22
40,Fantastic Staff,"Very nice location and new hotel. It is only two years old and not many people know about it. The service is fantastic. The staff is why you will be staying here. They are friendly, attentive and made our stay wonderful. Didn't eat at the hotel but the bar is nice. Maybe a little quiet. Some music in the waiting area would be nice. This hotel is young, they will get better and better but off to a great start. Highly recommend Alma.",5,2013,04,21
40,Luxury,"Luxury hotel with really helpful staff.  Very comfortable beds with lovely bedding, all Egyptian cotton.  Huge walk in shower as well as large bath.  Free mini bar with soft drinks. Very quiet hotel with large outside courtyard garden.  

We didn't have hotel breakfast as seemed very expensive.  Lots of bakeries and cafes nearby for breakfast.",5,2013,04,21
40,Discreet atmosphere and friendly service,"had a great time at this beautiful hotel, the thoughtful design of the rooms, the lobby and dining areas were just breathtaking plus very friendly service. rooms quiet, bright, beautifully organised with a view of Gaudi chimneys of the Casa Mila nearby. very discreet and intimate place. only downside was we chose to not use a room key but to use our fingerprint to open the door and it rarely worked. great idea but technically needs some help! but a minor issue for a lovely place . would stay again tomorrow!",5,2013,04,17
40,Perfect stay at Alma Barcelona,"Alma Barcelona is a luxurious, quiet haven located in a busy part of the city.  Everything about our stay was perfect, from the welcome drink during check-in to the turn-down service and the amazing, unobtrusive staff. We stayed in a Grand Deluxe room and it was a good size with a view of the rooftop of the neighbouring Gaudi apartment building. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had a lot of storage space, including ample space to hang up clothing. Malin and Goetz toiletries were provided in-room. Staff at Alma Barcelona were truly great, giving us personal recommendations for restaurants in the area. The spa area is small but well thought out and a relaxing space. Highly recommend Alma Barcelona.",5,2013,04,16
40,Very Discrete,"From the moment we checked in to the instant we left I felt as though we been treated to a peaceful haven in the middle of a busy city. The hotel is very discrete (none of the cabs we used knew where it was) and the subdued lighting makes it feel very private.

The service of the staff is impeccable - I have never received service like this before. Beautiful room - two TVs and a great shower - plus robes etc - and a massive bed.

Breakfast is £20 but then again you are paying for more than just the food - but if you want to eat £20 worth then you can easily do it.

Easy walk to the harbour or shopping areas and the Sagrada Familia is on the same street - about 20 minutes walk.

Traveled as a couple.",5,2013,04,15
40,Great staff on hand,In April 2013 we had four days at the Alma. The staff were great especially the reception staff. They did every thing to make our stay enjoyable. Even to arranging for a doctor at 9.30pm on a Sunday night. We were most great full. Hotel comes highly recommended. Plus hotel itself is well located.,5,2013,04,14
40,Excellent stay,"This was our first stay at Alma hotel but will not be the last.  Great hotel with fantastic location.  The service, size of rooms, standard of the rooms and everything was great.  Did not use the spa or the restaurant, went out in the morning to have a breakfast which local people use around that area.",5,2013,04,14
40,Perfect ending,"Recently stayed 2 nights at the Alma Barcelona . Chose this hotel based on Trip adviser reviews and location, one block from La Pedrera on a quiet side street. Close to best shopping too!  We arrived early morning, well before check-in and we're told our room would be ready in 1 hour and to our delight it was. reception area and dining area are so well designed and very contemporary. Hallways and interior areas are subtly lit, lots of ambiance. Finger print , keyless entry to rooms, sometimes a bit finicky.  First impression of our room: Wow!  It was an Executive suite. King bed with light weight down duvets. High ceilings, beautiful windows, huge all white marble bathroom, large deep tub and  separate toilet area, double sinks w. lots of space and huge shower and lovely Bulgari amenities. Reception was extremely helpful with dinner reservations as well as shopping suggestions, salons, anything you need.  Someone had recommended a restaurant in the harbor area, and they told us we might have trouble with last min. Reservations because it is popular with tourists, and suggested Catalan Senyor Parellada in trendy El Born area. preferred by locals , same owner. We liked it, didn't love it. Can't blame concierge , they were basing choice on our request. The next night was more successful reservations at Alba Granados , walking distance from the hotel. FANTASTIC ! Wonderful ambience, great service and open kitchen. Very extensive Catalan regional menu , small tapas sized plates as well as larger portions, would return every night if it were possible, the food was excellent. the local beef is Ox , we were a bit hesitant at first , but read how good it was - delicious. Breakfast  in the hotel is plentiful and wonderful, anything you might wish for is available and price is no higher than any good hotel, But there are small restaurants nearby. A perfect ending to a wonderful vacation in Spain! I recommend this hotel highly, and suggest you let them suggest restaurants.",5,2013,04,12
40,Perfect Hotel for couples to get away,"This beautifully designed hotel exceeded our expectations.  The facilities are well thought out, organised and very clean.  The staff could not be more polite and helpful.  The modern spacious room was well equiped perfectly clean and quiet.  The whole hotel was calm and tranquil.  The pool and spa areas are perfect to relax after a day sight seeing.   It is perfectly situated for all the delights the city holds.  The staff gave us excellent recommendations for restaurants and their own restauarant was very good.",5,2013,04,10
40,"Cool relaxed atmosphere inside, city buzz on the doorstep","Stayed here on the back of the glowing reviews and certainly wasn’t disappointed.  I went for the ‘basic’ room (Grand deluxe) which has plenty of space, one of the comfiest chairs I’ve ever sat in, a large bed and big walk in shower.  The toilet is separate, a nice feature, and, by having an open shower/sink area, the room avoids the classic hotel design issue whereby you walk into the room down a darkish corridor because they’ve carved out a separate bathroom.  However the open plan sink/shower might not be for everyone.  The staff are every bit as friendly and helpful as the reviews suggest and, without exception, spoke great English.  Finding an adapter for my 3-pin plugs was no problem and, having hung my rain-marked shoes on the door at night, a shoe-cleaning fairy returned them to me pristine (and without charge) by the next morning. My room at the back of the hotel looked out at the Gaudi chimneys a block away and was perfectly quiet:  I suspect rooms at the front on Carrer Mallorca might be noisier.  Otherwise the room could have been lighter – reading in bed was fine with a bedside spotlight on a bendy stem.  At a pinch that would have lit up the comfy chair too, but anyone with an elaborate make up routine would have struggled with the rather dim lights over the bathroom mirror.  The spa is a nice feature – didn’t try the massages etc, but the pool was good for a wake up dip. I tried the 25 Euro breakfast because by day 3 I was itching for something with more roughage than a croissant but the only museli option came with bits of chocolate – a Spanish feature I think.  The many local restaurants and cafes offer better value if not great health benefits.  Finally the English language TV options could have been better:  the BBC news channel had a wobbly picture and jumpy sound so I watched news of Mrs Thatcher’s death on Al Jazeera which came through perfectly!  As I could get Radio 4 through the free wifi I didn’t care enough to whinge but it might be more important for others.",5,2013,04,10
40,Boutique luxury in the heart of the city,"We stayed at the Alma in Barcelona for three nights at the end of March based on the TripAdvisor reviews the property received and I am glad we did.

This hotel is a real gem; its location in the city is perfect just off one of the luxury retail areas/boulevards of Barcelona and within walking distance to the harbour and other attractions such as the Picasso museum.  The Big Bus Tour (as well as the metro and regular public buses) stop two blocks from the hotel which is convenient too. As it's in a side street the rooms are really quiet which is great.

We stayed in an Executive Suite as we travelled with our 7 year old daughter (they don't allow an extra bed in their standard rooms) which was very modern, minimalist, spacious, quiet and comfortable. I am slightly surprised that they charge Euro 60 for an extra bed per night though which in my view is expensive, especially given that we already booked a more premium room category.

The room had free WIFI (slow at times), a free mini bar, complimentary water and nice Bulvgari amenities in the bathroom which featured a large walk-in rain shower, separate bath and separate toilet as well as a double sink.

Breakfast is not included and slightly expensive at 25 Euro per person, but worth it. It is served in the cosy lobby lounge which is very modern and you can sit outside in the courtyard when the weather is nice, a perfect start to your day. The offering at breakfast was good and included made to order eggs, pancakes, etc. so an extensive offering.

There is a gym and indoor pool, small but quirky design and has everything you need. The room access is cool too as it's done with your finger print or a regular keycard, whichever you prefer.

What makes this hotel really special is the service. When we arrived someone immediately came outside to greet and assist us and check in was smooth, personalised and friendly and the team used it as an opportunity to introduce us to all the services of the hotel, they made restaurant and museum bookings for us on the spot, all whilst we enjoyed a lovely glass of cava, courtesy of the hotel. All the staff were great and super helpful throughout our stay.

We would definitely return to this hotel when next in Barcelona and can highly recommend it to those that enjoy luxury boutique design hotels.",5,2013,04,08
40,"Alma, Barcelonas hidden gem","This hotel is just wonderful. Elegant and chic, located centrally, fantastic customer service, facilities brilliant including pool, gym, indoor and outdoor bar area. The glass of Cava when we checked in was a great touch. The finger print scan for room access is really cool, and means you dont have to worry about where youve put your key ;-)
Check out Cafe Josephine for breakfast one block from the hotel. For lunch or dinner Llamber and Cafe Kafka are fantastic. You wont be disappointed staying here.",5,2013,04,04
40,Could not be better,"I have stayed at many hotels in Barcelona.  The Arts and Pulitzer used to be favorites.  But neither compare with this hotel.  As others have noted, the staff is personable and very accommodating.  Rooms are imaculate, large, and modern.  And the place has a vibe.  I am very judgmental and could not finda flaw.",5,2013,04,01
40,To Much to Love!,"This is a fantastic hotel in a great location.  Every interaction with the staff was extraordinary.  The hotel is new, sleek, modern and comfortable. We did not use the spa but did check it out and it looked great.  Close to great restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions. For a first class stay - you must go here!",5,2013,03,28
40,Stay here,"Yet another glowing review for this tranquil oasis of a hotel.
With non existent Spanish and 21 hours of travel under our belts, Alma was paradise. Gracious reception staff, professional, accommodating and informative service, luxurious, quiet rooms. This is an excellent hotel. Breakfast is a broad array of delicious food and juices, perfect to fuel Gaudi expeditions and shopping. The location is great, central to the main attractions and a decent yet completely  ""do able"" walk to the more medieval barrios. For us, staying here helped us enjoy Barcelona even more.",5,2013,03,27
40,Outstanding hotel !,"Beautiful hotel. Professional, friendly staff. The outdoor garden is lovely. The main floor common area is modern, clean design and beautiful. The rooms have very comfortable beds, shutters that completely black out the room for late sleepers, and a second sliding door that eliminates any noise from the hall. The doors to the rooms can be let go and they will close very gently with no noise. I have never stayed at a hotel that was this quiet.  Great attention to detail in this hotel. Great location. I honestly can not think of one negative thing to say about The Alma.",5,2013,03,26
40,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,"My partner and I have just returned from a 5 night stay here. I had checked out the glowing reviews on trip advisor before we went but was skeptical, having been burned by good revis of bad hotels before!

However I am about to write my own glowing review! We took a taxi here straight from the airport (cost about 26 euros) and the welcome was fantastic. We were offered a glass of cava or water and the staff were so welcoming. Our bags were taken to our room as we checked in at the desk.

We were in one of the standard rooms which was a really decent size. Two twin beds pushed together which were unbelievably comfortable. A writing desk (with complimentary stationery) and a very comfy chair which my partner and I did spend most of the stay fighting over! The toilet is in its own enclosed space. The wash room had twin sinks, a huge walk in shower and a really deep wide soaker tub.  There is a hair dryer but ours wasn't working(didn't bother reporting to reception as I had brought my own). The free mini bar (which was restocked every day) consisted of 4 bottles of still water which we used to take out in our bags during the day, 2 cans of carbonated water, three assorted bottles of fruit juice, 3 cans of coke (diet, zero and full fat) plus 2 cans of estrella damm beer (1 non-alcoholic)

The keyless entry was so cool. This didn't work for my partner on the first try but we reported it to reception and they sorted it immediately. All of the reception staff were lovely, really helpful, there was always someone to say goodbye when you left or to welcome you back. If you're planning to use the bus turistic you can buy tickets from the desk and save 2 euros per person! The day before we left I asked reception to point me in the direction of an Internet cafe so I could check in online and print off my boarding pass and they just let me use the reception computer.

The cleanliness of the room is fantastic, the location excellent and the staff amazing. The decor is very minimal and elegant, not really my personal taste but very well done. The functional lighting took a bit of getting used to but I did not find it too dark like some other reviewers.  

I would return to the Alma in a heartbeat, cannot fault anything about this wonderful hotel!

Please note we did not try the restaurant or the spa.

40,"Friendly, professional and great location!","We've just got home from a 5 day break. Alma Hotel is in a great location a 5 min stroll to the metro, 5 to 10 min stroll to La Rambla and 5 mins to the Bus Turistic! And there are 2 of Gaudi's buildings on the doorstep.
Without exception the staff were friendly, professional and very helpful.
We got some great restaurant recommendations from the concierge team which really helped make our holiday.
We didn't eat in the hotel, breakfast seemed a bit expensive when there were done reasonable cafes across the road and round the corner. We did enjoy a drink in the bar though and again the service was impeccable! The prices were reasonable too.
We made use of the gym (could do with a cross trainer) and the pool. The pool is great for swimming lengths and just lovely. The sauna and steam are an added bonus. The whole area was immaculately clean.
All in all a classy hotel in a great location, I would definitely recommend it!",5,2013,03,23
40,great,"Great location. Very calming atmosphere - we commented that it appeared quiet but were advised (rightly or wrongly) that they were 90% occupied.  Staff very welcoming and as other reviewers have commented, simple things like a glass of Cava on arrival and a free minibar do wonders for the perception.  Room large, tastefully decorated, with just about a view of La Pedrera roof. Shower opens into the main room (partial wooden partitition) which won't be to everyones taste, but the loo is closeted away (unlike some).  Concierge successfully got us reservations at minimal notice. All in all, recommended. Oh, and the comfiest bed I've ever slept in",5,2013,03,22
40,superb hotel,"we stayed at hotel alma for valentines as we checked in we were offered a glass of cava which was well needed the staff were great the hotel was very quite which was a shame as lacked a bit of atmosphere but in the summer would be amazing as it has a fab garden to sit in 
The best thing was we right next door to all the designer shops a girls dream we had some great meals and would reccomend bar Torres fab tapas and great wine all in all we had a great stay at hotel alma and would definately return sooner rather than later hopefully (-:",5,2013,03,14
40,One of the best hotels ever,"I had read all the reviews about this place, and I was genuinely skeptical.  From the moment you walk in - the staff makes you feel truly special, a VIP and at the same time part of the family.
Our room was gorgeous - decor is elegant and the room had everything you could hope for and more - i.e. free mini-bar.  But it's the staff that makes this place.  My luggage had been lost in Paris, and Elizabeth at the front desk went out of her way to get my suitcase back.  It became her obsession.   My partner and I went out for dinner, and she called the restaurant to inform me that she'd found the suitcase and to enjoy my meal!  Sylvio - the concierge is funny - warm and incredibly knowledgeable.  I rarely trust recommendations from hotel concierges on where to eat, but trust the Alma staff.  They'll send you to amazing places.
I cannot say enough great stuff about this place.",5,2013,03,14
40,Incredible staff and sumptuous decor,"This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in.

The staff are so incredibly friendly and helpful, nothing was too much effort and they were a great laugh too. They speak excellent English so don't worry if your Spanish is 'fatal'! The staff have a certain charm which is welcoming, warm and genuine. They also provided us with a map of the city on our arrival.

We stayed in a superior room, which also gets you free soft drinks from the minibar during your stay (it is refilled every day) and a free welcome drink. The view from our room was great, you could see the chimneys of La Pedrera, one of Barcelona's famous tourist attractions. The room was great, very well sound-proofed, and pitch black at night when you drew the shutters across. The showerhead was massive, which made for an epic 'waterfall'-style experience. The turn-down of the room every day was also excellent.

The spa is simple but lovely, I believe it is being refurbished this week. Cash-rich travellers can order a massage in their rooms if desired. I didn't sample the food at the Alma but the restaurant décor seemed lovely.

I will say that it is not one of Barcelona's cheaper hotels, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for. I was busy all weekend, but I felt very well rested due to the quality of the sleep I had there. The Alma is in a great location for shops and tourist activities (20 mins walk north of La Rambla), and it is only 5 mins walk from the train and metro station 'Passeig De Gracia' (which has a train to the airport).

I will definitely return to the Alma! I miss it already!",5,2013,03,12
40,Perfect hospitality,"I stayed Alma for 4nights, and I really enjoyed our stay. It was much more than I expected.
Not only the lady who did our chek in (she was excellent !) but all other people were very friendly. They arranged everything for my check out morning even though I had to leave there at 5am.
The room was very modern and simple, very confortable bed, big bathtab, solid toilet room.
All the drinks at the room was compliment ,I didn't have to buy any water during sightseeing.
The location was also fantastic if you like very famous high brand shop. It is only 3 minutes walk  to spend more than 100 €！
I love to stay Alma if I have any chance to visit Barcelona again!",5,2013,03,11
40,The best in Barcelona!!!,Absolutely impressive and comfortable. Rooms are spacious and perfectly appointed. The staff is welcoming and friendly. Happy to go out of their way to assist. I almost don't want do post this review so I can come back and stay again without all the competition. A very special place. ,5,2013,03,10
40,Gorgeous hotel,Everything about this hotel is absolutely gorgeous and styled perfectly. The rooms look like they come right out of a Design Within Reach catalog (I say this as a compliment--ultra modern and stylized) and the building itself is beautifully designed. The only downside is that some of the ultra-modernity goes a tad too far and results in things that are less convenient than they are beautiful. The patio bar/restaurant is beautiful and serene and a great place for a night cap before bed.,4,2013,03,09
40,Very good except for breakfast rip-off,"At Euro 25 per head for breakfast you expect something special. Or at least something very good. To our shock and disappointment however, each day we had to request cereal bowls, plates and cutlery (numerous times at each sitting). Dreadful selection of cereals. Orange juice was on request only, as was the coffee which came (eventually) by the cup, not the pot. I'm really sorry in hindsight that we did not complain at the time. The problem did not seem to be lack of effort by the restaurant staff, who seemed very busy (but doing what I don't know) but rather the lack of any managerial oversight or direction. Also, in this day and age you expect to have tea and coffee facilities in the room. Not so at this hotel. Plus, a door between the bedroom and the bathroom would have been appreciated. This must have been a joke played by the architect or interior decorator at the time. Otherwise no complaints. A clean comfortable hotel with very helpful and efficient staff.",3,2013,03,08
40,I'm so cool but I'm a bear with a sore head without coffee.,"The guide books are not much help in deciding which location to stay in, L'Eixample is 'noisy, not good for walking, far from old city'. This is relative, coming form London on a first trip to Barcelona. I found the area had a relaxed air about the place, and ideally placed for many activities many within walking distance.

I concur with other reviews for this Hotel. It is cool and calm, the decor greys and blacks, utilising materials such as wood, leather and patinated steel, gentle light seems to glow from behind surfaces. The standard room was large with lots of wardrobe storage, very comfortable bed and quiet with views of the open courtyard and the famous chimneys of Casa Mila beyond. Our welcome was very warm, while I sipped the glass of cava I admired the stunning painting of a polar bear that hangs in reception. The staff very helpful, speaking good English, their suggestions for restaurants were spot on.

Why breakfast was so awful is mystifying in the circumstances, the service was dreadful. Coffee alone took several, increasingly desperate, prompts before it came after about 25 minutes. We didn't try it again instead going to local cafes where you can get good coffee and pastries costing only loose change. Another suggestion might be to nip across Pg de Gracia and have a very nice full breakfast at Loidi where you can help yourself to coffee. Hurrah!

Simple ratings are inadequate. We did complain about the breakfast and they didn't charge us for it. Mustn't forget the decent pool in the basement for your morning lengths.",4,2013,03,08
40,Beautiful Hotel Great Location,"Very classy hotel with excellent service.  Greeted with a glass of Cava while checking in.  Rooms are very clean.  Free Minibar service, mostly soda and water with a couple of beers, but still nice to have.  Excellent location, can walk to everywhere...",5,2013,03,07
40,very good,"Very nicely located hotel in the centre of Barcelona.  The staff was very welcoming and extremely helpful, yet not in trusive.  The design and interior of the hotel is remarkable.  We booked a deluxe room which was nice, although we missed a door on the walk-in shower (it was cold) and the bathroom.  Free Wifi and bar.",4,2013,03,03
40,"5 star rooms, 3 star breakfast","Beautiful, clean, well maintained rooms. Welcoming, efficient reception staff. Very good location, great decor.
The breakfast experience is like you are at a different hotel though. Expensive, badly laid out, unimpressive choice. Definitely NOT good value. My experience was in a very quiet period, only a few guests (literally 4 or 5 only at a time). Staff seemed already over-challenged, entirely absent (what are they all doing? And WHERE??) and forgetful. Tables not set (no knives, forks, spoons), tables not cleared. Orders forgotten, asked for room number multiple times. Breakfast? More or less any corner cafe will do you better.
Shame, as this lets down the excellent efforts made elsewhere at the hotel.",4,2013,03,03
40,Welcoming and great location!!,"My expectations for the Alma Barcelona were far exceeded. Yes, great location - nice size rooms - clean and comfortable.  What stands out, however, was the warm and professional staff - they made me feel so very welcome.  This made up for the high cost of breakfast - definitely not a deal breaker, though - there are several cafes nearby for breakfast.",5,2013,02,27
40,Decent luxury,"This nicely situated Hotel offer a nice and tranquil luxury. Quite stylish interior and suite like spacious rooms with contemporary equipment. Noise isolation of the rooms towards the street could be improved but is still ok. Free Wifi ( even for more the one gadget) and a free once a day replenished mini bar offer the piece in mind you like to see in any business hotel. 
The restaurant is offering I nice selection of dishes which are well cooked but the service is neither matching the lounge like relaxed style nor the quality of the food. 
Overall big thumbs up!",5,2013,02,26
40,Outstanding Service,"This is a really great hotel. The location is excellent right in the middle of the upmarket shopping district of Barcelona. The outstanding feature is the service provided by staff, they really couldnt do enough to help. The decor is extremley modern but both stylish and comfortable. The only slight quibble is that breakfast is €25 per head which is a little steep; it actually puts you off eating other meals in the hotel which is unfortunate as they are much more reasonable.",5,2013,02,24
40,Best value luxury hotel in Barcelona,"Great location off the Passeig de Gracia. Fairly large rooms (for European hotels) with cool keyless, fingerprint entry system. But the best thing about this hotel is the fantastic staff - extremely friendly and helpful, all (competently) multi-tasking as receptionist, concierge, porter, etc. Great value at current pricing.",5,2013,02,20
40,Brilliant Barca!,"We went to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and the whole weekend was superb. The hotel is first class with attentive and friendly staff, and an unbeatable location - once you find it! We got a taxi straight to it but if you were searching you might struggle as its signage is discreet to say the least! Breakfasts are costly but very substantial, so take your time and enjoy it. Barca itself is wonderful, and we walked the whole city over 3 days, taking in great tapas, wine ,culture et al. The market is great and the magic fountain is a must , especially when dark! Loved the architecture, the vibes and the Sunday closing for shopping!!!!! Get yourself there when you can, and you will be back. Didn't mention the Neu Camp, but having been there to cheer on the Reds in 99 to Champions league glory, you can't go and walk round an empty stadium can you!",5,2013,02,18
40,Brilliant hotel at exceptional value,"We stayed in this hotel for a week as a family in two interconnecting executive suites. 

In fact the executive suites are closer to very large junior suites than suites as such, because the bedroom and living room are not completely divided (there is a quite large two third height furniture unit dividing the sleeping area from the living area).

However I would highly recommend taking the executive suites over the standard rooms as they are very generously sized and very fairly priced. That said, the standard rooms are very good as well.

The service at every level, reception, doorman, porter, food and beverage staff, housekeeping, were truly excellent - consistently trying hard and consistently succeeding in delivering proper and personalized 5 star service. 

Super stylish, calm and understated interiors in both the public rooms and the accommodations. 

Fantastic indoor swimming pool, plus sauna and steam room which our three young boys loved. 

Barcelona is a very good value city, but even in that environment the Alma is exceptionally good and exceptional value.",5,2013,02,16
40,Wonderful,"We stayed in mid of January with my family and we were excited about our trip in Spain. The most remarkable spot in our trip was for sure the Alma Barcelona hotel. Everything was something more than great. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We knew almost nothing about Barcelona, we only read some guides, but they helped us out how to manage our 4 days there. The room was really big enough, comfortable and most of all... VERY QUITE!!! I would definitely come back here.",5,2013,02,16
40,A quiet retreat in a busy city,"The Alma Barcelona is a TripAdvisor top rated hotel for good reason.  The location is central to the business district of Barcelona.  The staff is very competent and quite attentive.  The rooms are very modern, but comfortable and very quiet.  We did not take advantage of the spa or pool, although I am sure they are of the same high quality.  As hotels go, this one is a splurge, but the return on investment is good.",5,2013,02,14
40,What really matters,"I have some quibbles with the hotel: the room furnishings are spartan; the restaurant seems largely unused;   But in the end, none of that matters because the Alma excels at the one thing that really matters, and that is customer service.  The service at the desk, regardless of who was on duty, was truly outstanding.  Everyone was enthusiastic, engaged, knowledgeable, friendly and fluent in English.  Requests were dispatched promptly. To folks like us, first time visitors to the city, that made all the difference.  
Restaurants abound (and the desk cheerfully provided us excellent recommendations), and the pictures here are accurate, so you can tell if the furnishings are to your taste or not.    What's unique about  the Alma is that its customer service is top drawer.",5,2013,02,13
40,You will find smiles.,"Located on one of the most interesting zones in Barcelona, the Alma Barcelona provides more than just a centric place to stay.  The staff provides excellent service, quick responses from inquiries and always the service came with a smile.  The room 101 (Junior suite), is spacious with good light, great bed and absolutely clean facilities.  Not a cheap hotel, but you get exactly what you are paying:  A delightful experience in a great environment.",5,2013,02,12
40,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location","We stayed at Alma Barcelona from the 29th of December till the 1st of January 2013. 
It is a very modern hotel but with a warm feeling. The receptionists do everything to let you feel at home from the first moment you walk in.  We had a grand deluxe room on the inside of the building and it was so quiet that we could sleep with the window open. A nice gadget is the fingerprintlock to open the door, so easy..wished i had it here at my home. If I return to Barcelona I will definitly return to Alma! The only remark I would like to make is to change the tables at the restaurant , they were to low to sit and eat breakfast comfortably.",5,2013,02,10
40,lovely experience,"Modern yet charming smaller hotel in very good location.  Excellent service and very good in- hotel breakfast.  Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  Just be aware that in some rooms the shower is not separated from the rest of the room by a wooden door, so make sure you are traveling with someone you are very close to.",5,2013,02,05
40,Couldn't ask for MORE,"I was part of a film unit shooting in and around the Barcelona area.  The majority of the crew stayed at the Alma for a matter of two to three weeks.

During this time, the staff at the Alma became another part of the CREW.  They were amazing, catering for every one of our needs and requests.  I HUGE THANK YOU to all of the front house, bar, waiting, and cleaning staff for their hard work, friendly attitude and great spirit.  

I will speak about our experiences with the Alma in years to come...always with a smile.  I couldn't recommend them enough.  As an international crew with various languages and accents, they were brilliant.

I cannot say enough and look forward to returning to our ""friends"" in years to come.",5,2013,01,29
40,Recommended,"My wife and I stayed here 3 nights in November 2012. We couldn't be more pleased with hotel. Quiet, relaxing and a very pleasant modern design. The dim light was just like a switch to get us in an unstressed mood. Our best recommendations.",5,2013,01,27
40,"Modern, minimalist, chic, quiet","New, modern, luxury hotel. Very silent, comfortable, all the amenities and accessories are best of breed. Rooms are spacious. Staff is very helpful. If you want an escape, especially as a couple, the hotel is perfect.
SPA is small, but you can relax for an hour. 
Location... It depends on what you expect. If you want to be in the middle of the old city, Ramblas, crowd, then Alma is not the right place for you. If you prefer to be at 10 minutes walking distance to all these, and to stay at a calm and luxury environment, then Alma is definitely right for you.",4,2013,01,24
40,"Pure understated class, amazing service, best location.","I stayed here for two nights in summer and it was fantastic. Beautiful minimal design lots of grey, black, silver, white. Really impressive foyer, large rooms with enormous walk in shower. Champagne on arrival, 1st class service, free mini bar, best location.  Only con was the spa which didn't have enough lounge chairs and seemed to not yet be complete. One very cool feature was the finger print technology instead of keys- pretty cool. I would come back on my next visit.",5,2013,01,23
40,Wonderful,"One of the best places I've ever stayed. The attention to detail is out of control, and the location is tops. Friendly staff helped point us to some incredible meals. If you appreciate architecture and design, this place will not disappoint.",5,2013,01,22
40,More style than substance,"Great concierge. Modern room. But lacking on the fundamentals. Door handle fell off. No bidet or hand washing in toilet area. No door to shower area means water gets everywhere. Small TV. Two singles pushed together instead of a king...that one of us kept sliding into.

Looks great though.",3,2013,01,22
40,"does not want to be a hotel, not for families","It is no coincidence that Alma Barcelona does not have the word ""hotel"" attached to it. It does not want to feel like a hotel and succeeds in making you feel you are not in a hotel. Great location. Excellent for couples on romantic trips. Not ideal for families.

Since this is not a tacky ""hotel"", there no flags outside, no doorman or porter, not even a real sign (just a tiny artistic ""alma""). The taxi drivers do not know it. You arrive, you open the big, dark door and hope for the best.  

For a couple Alma is great: there is a minimal lighting all around, lobby, reception, elevator, corridors and even rooms. Sexy perhaps? I guess, for many. Also, the Alma is brand new, it looks great. The staff is young and friendly. There are no magnetic cards or jeys, the room key is your fingerprint, so that adds to the mystique of the place. The rooms are big and the bathroom open plan with a big ""rain"" shower , again making it sexier. The furniture are minimalist designer ones. Overall, super for couples.

For a family though? Not ideal. The minimal lighting does not work well with young kids as they can become scared in various places of it. The breakfast is not plenty, not designed for kids, no eggs, no bacon, no pancakes (the chef agreed to make a few for my son as a favour), no to a selection of kid's cereal, not to a lot of things. 40 euros per person for in room breakfast, too expensive. In room dining not for kids, very limited ""adult"" options. The spa pool is super tiny. Did not work when we visited, reception did not even tell us when we arrived. 

Overall, great location, great for couples, big rooms, but not ideal for families with young kids. Will visit again with my wife, not with our 3 kids.",4,2013,01,21
40,Excellent - modern & elegant hotel,"We spent only one night in this splendid, modern and elegant hotel: Alma Barcelona which is located very central. The breakfast was excellent, very good English speaking staff, nice rooms.... we will come back, sure.",5,2013,01,21
40,Great hotel with great service,"on entering this hotel you are immediately sat down and made to feel special by very polite staff. It is a refreshing change from the train station style reception desk. You are even offered a complimentary drink. The decor is excellent and the rooms have amazing fingerprint technology. Choose a quite back facing room. The hotel is well located and walking distance to most sites. The reception restaurant is relaxing and though the menu is limited and not cheap, the food quality is excellent. Staff overall are very helpful. The rooms have an open plan bathroom more suited to couples. I would not mind staying here again.",4,2013,01,20
40,Minimalist Catalan Elegance,"I stayed at the Alma Barcelona for 2 weeks, visiting close friends, from Christmas through Reyes. Having stayed at the Mandarin Oriental (tiny rooms), and Hotel Sixty-Two (modern suites, but still tiny, though highly recommended), I opted for the 2-year old Alma.

Room:
Splendid. Could not be happier. I occupied an exec suite facing Carrer de Mallorca, which was spacious, comfortable, nice finishes (mix of old paneling and parquet floors, with modern furnishings, and ample closets, and sitting area), living area, 2 TVs, huge bathroom, and great room service. Generous closet space. Great all-white Thassos-marble bathroom - great shower, tub, double sinks - and unlimited mini bar. Good quality Bulgari toiletries. Housekeeping was detailed, and made sure to keep the fridge stored with my preferred Vichy bubbly water, and diet coke. Pillows are a bit squishy, and mattress hard, as is usual in Europe. Great duvet, and bed sheets (changed daily - loathe the 'earth-friendly'/ corporate-profitable no sheet & towel change policies, these days) - I'm fussy about these things. Turn down service decent. Choices & weather etc. Wifi is free, though can be sometimes erratic - one code, per device, so be sure to let the front desk know how many iPads, laptops, ereaders you have.

Service:
Helpful, polite, and precisely what you would expect of a 5* hotel. The front desk is friendly, and they are when you need them, and invisible, when you do not. Loathe unctuous service.

Breakfast/Food:
Breakfast is equally minimalist - great juices, cava, cured meats, cheese, and hot brekkie, if desired. Be sure to confirm that breakfast is included with room. I checked thrice, was told no problem, only to be charged €25 per breakfast during my 15-day stay. Oh well. Quality & service is excellent.

Aesthetic:
Loved that it was an old bank, converted into a minimalist hotel. 76 rooms total. Do splurge for the better rooms/ suites. I was informed the cheaper rooms had no bed/bath separation, and can be dark. The suites are generously large, and well-insulated. Though facing Carrer Mallorca, and through New Year's, all was quiet. The back garden is splendid. Spa was pretty decent.

Location:
What can I say? A+++. Steps from Passeig de Gracia. Close to shops: La Pedrera, Vincon, Suarez, Casa Batllo, LV, Hermes, Loewe, etc etc. 5 mins from Placa Catalunya. 8 mins from La Sagrada Familia. 2 mins from Gran Via, and the wonderful gourmet shop, Colmado Quilez, and  the deliciousness of the prepared foods of Mauri. Steps away from the Metro, if needed, or easy access to cabs. Sufficiently far away from Las Ramblas, unless you aspire to touristy crowds, though still within walking distance. ATM right in front of hotel entrance, on Carrer de Mallorca.

Overall:
I have an unfortunate predilection for traveling well (personal, not business), and the Alma Barcelona certainly did not disappoint. I was not thrilled by the extra breakfast charges, after being thrice assured they were included in my room rate, though I also regret not arguing, given the long duration of my stay. Service was impeccable. The aesthetics were great. The biometric room entry system many complained about only hiccuped once, and the staff rectified that immediately. Oh, and the hotel bar closes at 12M - bizarre for Barcelona. To conclude: not cheap, especially the suites, but great on everything else. Certainly better value than the M.O. on Passeig de Gracia. I'd return again.

Conclusion: Great location, unusual design, great service, and pricing is not bad. Highly recommended.

40,Excellent Customer Service,"We spent 4 nights at Alma Barcelona ,with a group of friends ,and we all mutually agreed that we have never seen such impeccable customer service .the staff were very friendly ,speak excellent English ,great follow up,and try their very best to get you a reservation in a club/restaurant on New Years Eve .They even sent a cab to the airport with personal belongings that we had forgotten in the room after checkout .                                        As for the hotel itself ,I have two comments 1.it is too dimly lit ,which is part of the overall modern theme ,however the corridors are actually pitch dark during midday .                   2.the toilets are in a separate room next to the door ,faraway from the shower and washing basins ,and it did not have a bidet or water hose ,which some of our friends found inconvenient .in addition to trash bin there.                                                                 Other than that everything else was perfect ,and the location is strategic .thumbs up !",4,2013,01,18
40,Great hotel & nice staff,"This hotel, which is very well located, is very clean and have awesome beds! What make this hotel 5 star is the excellent staff and also, the quality of the service offered. The pool & spa area is also very clean and beautiful! My room had a garden view and I was on the 6th floor. 
I can't give this hotel 5 star because of the food service. The breakfast is way too expensive (25 euros / person) for the quality you get (bad cappucino etc..). They also need to improved their ""a la carte"" wine and cavas selection"". 
I spent 6 nights at alma barcelona.",4,2013,01,15
40,Great property & wonderful service,"The boutique hotel has just the right mix of charm, sophistication and off the beaten path appeal.  The concierges understand how to balance helpfulness and quiet guidance with straight forward directions. They recommended wonderful restaurants, many which were tapas & did not take reservations that were favored by locals. This was great because I am always hesitant to ask for recommendations for fear of being sent to an over-priced tourist trap. The rooms were spacious and luxurious and my favorite feature was the bio-metric lock - so very James Bond.",5,2013,01,14
40,Great Place,"We spent one night at the hotel. Past reviews are right, it's a wonderful hotel Angelina was so nice, and a glas of Whiskey means a half bottle of it, the rooms are outstanding, location is perfect, nearby Zara and La Pepita  - great place, we will come back! Marcel and Kay",5,2013,01,13
40,Too Many Flaws,"First, the good news: excellent location, friendly staff, comfortable beds.  However, we experienced so many flaws at the Alma that we cannot recommend this hotel.  The hotel has a minimalist style.  This, in itself, is not a negative.  Done correctly, minimalist design can enhance a hotel guest's comfort and enjoyment.  At the Alma, however, minimalism is too often achieved at the sacrifice of guest convenience and comfort.  Some examples:

- The rooms are very dark.  Even with all room lights on, lighting was insufficient.  Hallways are extraordinarily dark.  If Alma is achieving energy efficiency, it is doing so at the cost of guest comfort and convenience.

- Furnishings are cheap, not luxurious.  Our desk was a two foot square butcher block table.  Adequate, but neither comfortable nor convenient.  The veneer covering the freestanding cabinet in our room was coming unglued and peeling away (see photo).  The same problem existed in the other room occupied by our group.

- The wash basin is on the opposite side of the room from the WC.  You must exit the WC and cross the room to wash your hands.  Are the wash basin and WC separated so 2 guests can use the facilities more comfortably?  If so, and the room is designed for 2 guests,  then why is only 1 wash basin provided?  This arrangement is adequate but not convenient, and certainly not luxurious.

- The wash basin mirror is illuminated by a single bulb attached to the wall adjacent the wash basin.  No corresponding bulb is provided on the opposite wall or ceiling.  Consequently, when shaving or applying makeup, one side of your face is illuminated while the other is in shadow. 

- The finger-print room entry system often required 2 or 3 attempts to open the door.  For one member of our group (we are a family of five) the system never worked, despite several attempts to correct. 

- Although Tripadvisor ranks Alma as the second highest rated hotel in Barcelona, none of our taxi drivers knew the hotel's location.  Be sure to carry the hotel's address card with you.  (Of course this is not the Alma's fault.  But it suggests the hotel is, in fact, less popular than might be inferred from Tripadvisor's reviews).

We also experienced additional small problems with the TV, the closet light and the heating.  Each of these flaws, by itself, is minor.  There are, however, too many flaws to ignore, especially at the prices being charged by the Alma.",2,2013,01,12
40,First class hotel,Past reviews are all correct. Fantastic hotel in great location near Gaudi and Gracia. Had my wallet stolen from station first day and hotel staff could not have been more helpful. Rooms are large and stylishly appointed and beds heavenly! Free mini bar is nice! ,5,2013,01,08
40,"Cool, calm and convenient","It was our first visit to Barcelona, and we were keen to notch up some tourist points, as well as just soak up the general atmosphere. The Alma is just a stone's throw from Casa Batllo and La Pedrera and a 20 minute stroll from the Sagrada Familia, so we were easily able to tick off some key Gaudi sites (and utterly amazing they were too). We also simply strolled from the hotel down to the Columbus Monument, and then lose ourselves in the Gothic Quarter.
After all this wandering and exploration, it was lovely to relax back at the hotel - so quiet and serene. We decided on a drink in the bar - and having asked for a G&T I was asked if I would like to see the menu - a menu exclusively of Gin and Tonics - 12 choices - very impressed!
We slept soundly, again thanks to the peace, and to the cleanliness and comfort of the room (possibly also the gin). The staff were smiley and helpful, and very understanding when we arrived back well after checking-out time, having been completely absorbed by Casa Batllo.
For breakfast we had coffee and pastries, not wanting to go for the full buffet (the hotel are very flexible about this). On the second day we ventured out to a neaby cafe, up towards Casa Fuster (marvellous bar, by the way) and breakfasted amongst the dog-walking locals.
There is still so much left to do and see and eat and drink - so we will be returning to Barcelona, and will happily stay at the Hotel Alma again.",5,2013,01,08
40,Pure bliss in the middle of it all......,"My wife and I spent 5 days at this luxurious hotel just off of the Passeig de Gracia.  Shopping, eating and a little Gaudi was what we had planned.  For this stay we decided to try the Hotel Alma Barcelona.  We could not have been more pleased.

As previous reviewers had said it is perfectly located.....just steps away from all the sights (La Pedrera, Casa Batlló, La Sagrada Família (20min stroll)) and the don't forget all the shopping.  Our room was on a high floor facing the courtyard and was very, very quiet.  I don't exagerate.  It was like sleeping in a bank vault!  The room was decorated in a minimumalist urban chic style with comfortable beds.  The toilet was seperated from the bathing area in a room all to itself.  The walk-in shower was big enough to fit a Renault 4 and the dual rain shower heads were a nice touch.  The modest complimentary mini-bar was well received after long days of sight-seeing and shopping.  Housekeeping was very attentive and serviced the room often.  The flat screen TV was really big and had the usual channels but we weren't there to watch movies.  The only thing that I would comment on about the room is the lighting.  The room is dark which adds to the metro-cool ambiance but we couldn't help but wish for just one more halogen floor lamp. Maybe I am just getting old.....????

My wife had used the pool and sauna during our stay and was quite pleased.  The place isn't very large but she was able to lap back and forth in the pool mostly because she was by herself.  The only negative comment she made was that she wished there was a phone or something in the spa in case there was an emergency.  

The dining area where we had breakfast was nice and had everything that you would want.  The quality was excellent.  Ok, the 25 euros is steep compared to the numerous cafes around the hotel but you pay for the convenience.  A calm, quiet breakfast after a night of partying beats dragging your butt into an impersonal and noisy cafe. Plus, the coffee is really good!

Finally, I must point out that the best part of the hotel is the reception staff.  They make the difference.  They are young, energetic and are always looking to please but not overbearingly so.  Have a question?  They'll answer it for you or they'll get an answer for you. Kudos to the  management who have trained them so well.

So in summary, the hotel is well located, the facilities excellent, the staff exceptional and competively priced for a *****GL boutique hotel in the Ritzy neighborhood of Passeig de Gracia.",5,2013,01,07
40,A great hotel,"We loved this hotel!  Great location to walk everyplace--all the sights and superb restaurant choices.  We had a room overlooking the lovely courtyard which also serves drinks and meals.  The room was spacious and modern as was the bathroom.  Huge walk in shower.  The bed and linens were luxurious.  

The staff is also superb.  They took care of getting us tickets for Gaudi cathedral, recommended restaurants and were just incredibly friendly and up beat.

We would not stay anyplace else!",5,2013,01,06
40,Fantastic!,"I was treated to a weekend here in December for my birthday and have found my favourite hotel, in my favourite city. The Alma is stylish without being pretentious, and is brilliantly located just of the Passage De Gracia....excellent for walking around this amazing city. Close to La Predrera, and to tubes at Diagnal. 
We LOVED the room which was spacious, subtle and stylish. The bed was the best hotel bed I've ever slept on.
Staff were wonderful throughout, from welcoming us with a glass of Cava to chatting to us as we waited for our return airport transfer car. 
I was genuinely sorry to leave this wonderful hotel, and I can't wait to stay again.
Well done on a fabulous hotel which really makes a stay in this great city special.",5,2013,01,06
40,Stay at alma,"An excellent hotel and one I will certainly return to. The hotel itself was close to the heart of many of the tourist attractions and within walking distance of the Sagrada Familia and the Casa Battlo. It was close to a lovely shopping street and a metro. However its most outstanding feature was the quality of the staff team. Nothing was too much trouble for the concierge staff or the bar/restaurant staff. The rooms were very clean but a little dark  - I suspect this would not be an issue in the summer months. I appreciated the calmness of the hotel but it may be a little too quiet for guests who want a 'party' atmosphere. The Alma Hotel must rank as one of the best I have ever stayed in. A truly memorable stay.
      ",5,2013,01,05
40,The perfect base for your Barcelona stay,"We rang in the New Year at Hotel Alma, and it was perfect.  The staff are all customer service oriented.  They go out of your way to accommodate your requests and deliver every time.  The hotel is located off of Passieg de Gracia  - i.e. you're in the heart of the city.  The hotel is in between the Diagonal and Passieg de Gracia metro stops with the Diagonal being a block closer to the hotel.  There is a McDonald's and Starbucks nearby as well as several local cafes and tapas bars.  The concierge helped us with restaurant reservations - especially trying to secure last minute New Year's Eve reservations - but they delivered on that score as well.  
As far as the actual room accommodations go, it was comparable to a 4*-5* American hotel.  Clean, modern, new - very comfortable queen size bed, complimentary mini bar that got fully replenished every day, daily turndown service in addition to housekeeping. 
We would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2013,01,05
40,The Best,"Simply the Best.  
We stayed there for new years.  We were 5 Rooms and we did not know anything about the hotel except the reviews. We followed our gut feeling and reviews and it was amazing.   I Love the hotel and the staff was great.  The rooms were amazing, and the location as well.  Again, all i will say is simply the Best.

Great Job.",5,2013,01,05
40,The Best in Barcelona,"We stayed over New Year - fantastic hotel! Great central location just off Passieg de Gracia. Check in was prompt, staff were knowledgable and couldn't do more for you. The room was big and stylish with complimentary mini-bar and impeccible cleanliness. The spa was small and there were only two loungers but great for a dip after a long day sightseeing. The check-in/concierge staff knew the local area inside out so be sure to ask them for restaurant and bar options as they will give you good advice! In all, one of the best hotels I have stayed in worldwide. We will return to Barcelona in the near furture and when we do we will stay at the Alma because I don't think there is any way it could be topped!",5,2013,01,04
40,Loved it  !,"We stayed at the Alma for just one night before flying back to the UK after 2 weeks in the Emporda region.  The staff on main reception were both welcoming and very imformative with regards to restaurants and made a few bookings for us.  Due to our short stay we had time for 2 lunches and one dinner - all of which we enjoyed.  Great tapas for lunch and seafood for dinner!  The room was spotlessly clean and had a view into the gardens at the back of the hotel, so lovely and quiet.  Comfortable bed, great bathroom and very good location.  We visited Casa Batllo - one of the Gaudi properties which was amazing.  We loved Barcelona and would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,01,04
40,A invaluable gem,"Just before New Year we spent 4 nights in this beautiful hotel which deserves the best reviews. The front staff who we saw most deserves a very big ""thank you"". I have rarely experienced a stay in a hotel where the staff is so professional, so kind and so smiling at any time of the day. We really felt like home and were always greeted no matter what time of the day/night and how many times we left or came back to the hotel. (Dear Staff, it is thanks to your excellent work that your hotel will not only reach the top ranks of Tripadvisor but also stay at the top). The hotel is contemporary and very quiet which is must for us. I loved using my fingerprint to open our room door. This is such a clever idea and it so convenient not to carry out a key or a card. Our room was very spacious and simply decorated but with much taste. Our bathroom was big but did not have a door which means that you do not have much intimacy, but the goods news is that we had a separate toilet which is very unsual in a hotel room and again a bright idea. The hotel location is perfect for shopping, sightseeing, going out to restaurants, etc. We took a bus shuttle from Barcelona airport to Plaça Catalunya which costs 10 Euros for a return ticket. It is a 15 min. walk to the hotel, but there also plenty of taxis waiting at Plaça Catalunya if you do not feel like walking and/or if you are travelling with heavy luggages. We will definitely stay in our Spanish home next time we visit Barcelona. Viva Alma, via Espana!!!",5,2013,01,03
40,excellent,we stayed as a couple for 4 days and enjoyed it very much. The serenity of this place and the kindness of the personal was extraordinary. We will definitely return to the hotel even if there is nothing else to do in Barcelona. I hope that this place stays as cool as it is now.,5,2013,01,03
40,An amazing hotel in the center of Barcelona,"We arrived in Barcelona very early in the morning the day we were supposed to check in. Having just landed after a red-eye flight, my husband and I were swaying on our feet as we arrived at the hotel. I figured if they couldn't get us into a room early, we might just be able to have our bags secured. One of the concierge workers had us sit down as she worked to arrange an available room for us. While we were waiting another worker whisked our bags upstairs. I was truly amazed and thankful that she did that for us. We went up to the room, took a much needed shower, and slept the day away. The room was gorgeous, modern and spartan. I need to alert travelers though: even though there's a partition between the room and shower, the shower is very much open! This is fine for couples but is not very family-oriented. There was a black-out door which was lovely considering we just needed sleep. We heard absolutely no noise...and we were facing the courtyard where construction was going on in a neighboring building. 

There are complimentary beverages in the fridge, water and some lovely juices.
The next morning we ate downstairs for breakfast. It was a great spread, but very pricey. It was an enjoyable laid back feel, and in better weather it would be nice to eat out on their patio.

As we were checking out, they quickly arranged for a taxi to the port. 

Our short stay here was absolutely wonderful and if and when we return to Barcelona, I'll be sure to keep Alma in mind!",5,2013,01,01
40,perfect and relaxed stay,we spent 4 nights at alma and enjoyed it every minute. the whole service was wonderful and never intrusive. if we come back to lovely barcelona we will stay at alma! thanks for all the effort! and by the way the fingerprint security system is perfect for not having to worry about keys and the search for them:-),5,2013,01,01
40,Great hotel,"Though a bit pricey, especially on weekends, this hotel rocks! It's on a quiet block in a great area of Barcelona, nearby tons of ritzy shops (Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabanna, Gucci, Chanel, etc.) and the metro and two gorgeous Gaudi houses. The staff is wonderful. They're totally nice, very well-spoken and give great restaurant and sight-seeing tips. Thankfully, they advised me to buy tickets to Sagra Familia online the night I checked in, so that we could enjoy the cathedral and skip the lines. Every restaurant they recommended was great. There's a sauna and hot tub, which I never used, and a small gym, which I did use. The rooms are a bit dark, but beautfiul and tastefully decorated in contemporary style. The beds are super comfortable. I'd stay at Alma again in a heartbeat.",5,2012,12,30
40,Just perfect,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay at Alma. Staff is very friendly and most helpfull.
The rooms are spacious and the bed excellent, we loved the style and decoration
Will definitely return when we visit Barcelona in the future !",5,2012,12,26
40,Enjoyed our stay!,"We stayed at the Alma for three nights in October 2012, prior to taking a cruise. I picked it on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews, among others, and was not disappointed! We arrived after a long flight and were warmly welcomed with a glass of cava. The front desk staff members serve as concierges as well and are very knowledgeable and helpful. Any questions were answered promptly, and the attention paid to us was excellent. For example, there were threats of a strike that might have affected one of the hop on-hop off bus lines, and the desk clerk went out of his way to keep us posted.
     Our room (an executive suite) was spacious and sleek. The fingerprint-id keypad was cool! It had good spot lighting; could have used some light in the middle of the room as well. As others have noted, the breakfast is rather overpriced at 25 euros. We strolled around the corner and found several pleasant places to get a more reasonably priced breakfast.
   Location was perfect! Just steps from the Passaig de Gracia, the Alma is within walking distance of Sagrada Famiglia, Casa Mila, and Casa Battlo, among other notable places. We highly recommend the Alma and would stay there again.",5,2012,12,25
40,GREAT HOTEL IN BARCELONA,Great hotel with outstanding service.  The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs.  Front desk personnel actually walked with me to a bank ATM to insure that I was able to purchase tickets to Sagrada Familia Church (a definite must see).  The hotel has a minimalistic style and was a little dark throughout which is not necessarily my style but overall very nicely done.  Complimentary drinks were much appreciated and we got to enjoy brunch which was slightly expensive but very good.  Would definitely consider re-booking the Alma in what we hope is return trip to Barcelona in the near future.,5,2012,12,25
40,Excelent stay,"I enjoyed my stay at Alma hotel. The staffs were helpful and professional. The one thing they could improve is the variety of food in the restaurant and room service menu. At least there is an option for ala carte or buffet breakfast. Charging for a 6 yr old child the same as adult is unfair, especially when the child only ordered 1 boiled egg and 1 bowl of rice (€25!!). Overall the hotel is very good.",4,2012,12,24
40,An amazing hotel in a great location,"I think this is my new favorite hotel.  There are too many positives to list.  
The staff are so accommodating.  Yes, it's their job, but they are consistently helpful, polite, and extremely knowledgable about the area and city in general, more so than most other hotels I've stayed at.  The room we stayed in was great (executive suite - the smallest room they had at the time that would sleep 2 adults and 1 child) - it overlooked Mallorca street, and while a little noisy during peak traffic hours it was nice and quiet at night. It was very nicely and tastefully decorated, and had a large bathroom with a big, comfortable bath tub and top-notch fixtures.  The free drinks (including a couple of beers but no wine/hard liquor) in the mini-bar were nice, as was the free wi-fi. It's really nice to stay at a hotel and not feel like you're being nickeled and dimed to death, especially at these kinds of prices.
The fingerprint locks on doors seemed a bit gimmicky at first (you can choose to use a keycard instead) but our 5 year old was so impressed we had to go that route, and we actually found it really helpful. No more digging for key cards, having them stop working because you put them too near your phone, making sure everyone has a copy, etc.  We didn't really need to carry anything around the hotel, and getting locked out of the room is a thing of the past.
The hotel bar/restaurant was good, though the menu is a bit limited.  The wait staff are very good, although sitting outside on the rear terrace can leave you a bit stranded as they don't tend to remember you're there. I do recommend using the terrace though, if you can. It's a great place to relax and have a drink after a long day.
We didn't use the fitness center, but it seemed pretty minimal, so maybe not the place to stay if you're a fitness buff.
We got a number of recommendations on things to see, places to visit and eat, etc, from the staff, and all of the ones we tried were great.  The hotel is in a great location - about a 45 minute walk from the docks and the aquarium, and an hour or so from the gaudi park in the north - and there are a number of good restaurants within an easy walking distance.
All in all this was a very pleasant stay, and we will use this hotel again the next time we're in Barcelona.",5,2012,12,24
40,Alma is a delight,"I'm trying to find excuses to return to Barcelona, just so I can stay at the Alma! Yes, it can be a bit dark in the corridors but fortunately the finger-print reader glows, and you don't need to look for a keyhole! The room was modern, comfortable, clean and couldn't be faulted. The complimentary water, juices and soft drinks were appreciated too. Location was good - easy walk to Las Ramblas, Sagrada Familia and Cinc Sentits for a divine dinner.
The staff were always willing to help and provide any information requested. We were there during the austerity protests and the staff kept us informed throughout, as well as ensuring the hotel was secure in case of any incidents. The only minor niggle was that we bought vouchers from the hotel for the Bus Turistic (in order to buy discounted tickets), but turns out the company was participating in a partial strike that week, therefore tours started later than usual. We went with the Barcelona City Tour bus instead since they weren't on strike, and obviously lost out on the vouchers. It would have been good if the hotel staff had known about this and told us before selling the vouchers. 
Nonetheless, we really enjoyed our stay at the Alma and hopefully will be able to re-visit it.",5,2012,12,23
40,sensuous minalimalism with superb service,"we had a fabulous time in Oct 2012 for 5 days.  would go back without hesitation.  excellent rooms, excellent food, really comfortable beds, really friendly staff. had one problem one night, they immediately made good.  we have an architecture firm and are very pickly about food as well as design. plus I have some severe orthopedic problems. but this hotel won us over with its high standards throughout!",5,2012,12,17
40,"Well designed, modern hotel in a great area","I found the Alma on Hotels.com and as usual checked the trip advisor reviews before booking. Reviews were mostly good, so I went ahead. I wasn't disappointed. We did get an upgrade, so although I thought it was great value for money at 209 Euros per night, I didn't actually see the room that costs that. The room we did have was very large, and very well equipped. Great power shower, dual sink bathroom, nice seating, well planned, and for once, more sockets than we actually needed. European hotels seem reluctant to provide irons in the room, something I always like, but on request despite initially offering us an ironing service, they did provide an iron and ironing board. We also had the best sleep in a hotel for a long time, the beds were soooo comfortable, the room was quiet and the shutters could be closed to block out all light. All round I felt the staff were friendly, accommodating and extremely professional. In short, I couldn't fault the Alma and will return when next in Barcelona. I may even visit Seville just to try out the Alma there. We didn't use the spa, so I haven't given it a rating.",5,2012,12,17
40,Best service ever,"Alma Barcelona combines great service that is still personal and friendly, the finest of locations without being crowded or noisy, spacious rooms and a super sleek design while retaining a feeling of intimacy and warmth - it's a real rarity, I will never stay anywhere else until everyone else finds out!

RoyNY",5,2012,12,16
40,Two Fatal Flaws,"The Alma is everything the other reviewers said: great location, delicious food, a quiet terrace in the back with comfy chairs, friendly and helpful staff. However two fatal flaws mean I will never stay there again: 

1) The rooms are painted dark blue and it's impossible to see anything. The staff brought us extra lamps but even so it was difficult to find things in the room, there was no way to work and the only place we could see anything was in the bathroom. Even the hotel staff admitted they get complaints about it and they told us there was  no point in changing rooms because they were all very dark. It is part of the look.

2) There is no gym. What they call a gym is a small room with a few weights and a mat. You can stretch there but there is no aerobic equipment. Given that a decent treadmill can be bought for a bit more than 1,000 euros I have no idea why they didn't buy one. But they didn't. The pool is also quite small.

If you want a romantic and atmospheric weekend then sure stay at the Alma. But if you want to work or read or spend time relaxing in your room then just don't bother. We go to Barcelona regularly and have been searching long and hard for the right hotel. We found Alma on trip advisor and I thought my search was over but that turned out not to be the case.",4,2012,12,15
40,Hotel perfection found!,"The Alma Barcelona may be one of Barcelona's best kept secrets!  Even if the City's taxi drivers have often never heard of it (make sure you have the address with you to help the drivers locate it), you will know you have found heaven when your taxi pulls up to it's unassuming facade.  Just two doors off Passeig de Gracia on Mallorca, you are steps away from lux shopping paradise, amazing restaurants and wonderful tapas spots and wine bars.    Housed in an entirely remodeled Mallorca manse, this modern design gem delights at every turn.  From the impressive entry, where the wonderful front desk staff offer you a beverage while you check in (""Cava?""  ""Why yes, please!""), to the absolutely silent, simple yet have all you could ask for rooms, the Alma pleases at every turn.  The rooms are spacious, without being overwhelming and are absolute havens of quiet.  Our sixth floor room at the back of the hotel gave a delightful view of the Pandrera; lit up at night, it was a Barcelona landmark framed by our window!  And the staff?  I could go on and on for days at how wonderful the staff were!  Every request we had was honored promptly and perfectly and the staff genuinely seemed interested in our comfort and enjoyment.  From helping with restaurant reservations to calling for taxis, they were spot on.  I actually looked forward to coming back to the hotel or down to the lobby, just to chat with the staff!  You will be extremely hard pressed to find a better hotel in Barcelona.",5,2012,12,14
40,Excellent location and extremely helpful staff,"Hard to fault this hotel really.  The location is very handy for the Gaudi houses and top class shopping in Eixample district.  The concierge service is invaluable with advice about buying tickets for attractions and public transport etc, and booking tables at restaurants for your evening meal!  However, breakfast in the hotel is pricey and there's a nice cheap branch of Cafe & Te just around the corner....
Our room was beautiful, very comfortable bed and an easy chair we fought over!  My only criticism is that when one of you is an early riser, it's inconvenient not to have a door on the bathroom (there is a separate toilet!) but it means you can't put the bathroom light on or take a shower/bath without waking up your partner.

There is a spa and fitness area but we didn't have time to make use of them.",5,2012,12,12
40,Gorgeous hotel,"After spending a week at the Alma in Seville two years ago and loving it i was very keen to stay at the Alma in Barcelona. Even with my high expectations i was impressed.  The staff are excellent, the spa was very good, the lounge, dining and courtyard areas are very well done. Every aspect of the hotel is top notch.  I'd love to stay for longer next time.",5,2012,12,07
40,Just Wonderful !,"Although it was only for one night, it was a great experience.  As stated in other reviews, the staff was great and just couldn't do enough for us.  Location was in the centre of everything.  Even going out at night, we felt safe and had a great selection of restaurants nearby. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone",5,2012,12,03
40,Beautiful Hotel with a great staff,"The staff was really wonderful and this hotel was in a great location. While I can say this hotel was one of the better places I have ever stayed, I can also say it wasnt the best value. The rooms were very nice, I really liked the biometric locks and design and the staff was extremely helpful, probably the best staff i have seen in a hotel EVER.",4,2012,11,28
40,an Oasis amongst the wonderful commotion that is Barcelona !,"I cannot express what an amazing staff has been gathered by the Hotel Alma.  This hotel does not need a Concierge as every member of its staff is a concierge.  Specifically ""Xavi"" who went above and beyond to make our one night stay memorable.  Often, the ""one nighters"" are not treated as well as those who come for longer periods of time.  That was not the case.  When we return to Barcelona, this is where we will be staying.  

The breakfast is amazing.  After eating at all the fabulous restaurants in town, I still looked forward to their breakfast.  It was THAT good.  

Location is perfect. Bed is amazing.  Your back and neck will thank you. 

Thanks once again Hotel Alma.",5,2012,11,27
40,Surpassed expectations,"The Alma was a lovely hotel with superior staff located in a beautiful, safe, lively part if Barcelona. Key-less entry to the room is a new requirement for me! I really can't recommend the hotel enough. Oh, and the free mini-bar with water, juice and soda was an added bonus! 5 stars!",5,2012,11,27
40,"Old World Attentiveness in a Sleek, Contemporary Setting","I smile every time i think about tour time at the Alma. As other reviewers have said, we felt totally cared for from the moment we walked in the door. No matter what we needed, the staff was friendly and spot on with their suggestions. The decor is sleek and contemporary, but still very warm and comfortable. We're still talking about the beds and pillows...they're a heavenly experience. Great location too. We won't look any further for a hotel when in Barcelona.",5,2012,11,26
40,Beautiful Hotel Alma,"We just returned two weeks ago from staying at Hotel Alma Barcelona. From the moment we walked through the door, we were greeted, served a sparkling wine & it was wonderful.
Lobby is stunning, staff was kind & professional. Our room, the bed, shower, just perfect.
We invited friends for wine & tapas in the dining area. The service, tapas, wine made for a great evening. I highly recommend it.
Very pleased & we will definitelly return, on our next visit to Barcelona. 
Location is a 10!!!",5,2012,11,25
40,Exceptionally Comfortable Beds,"This hotel earned 5 stars for its location and its exceptionally comfortable beds.  The front desk staff were also very welcoming and helpful.  We liked the modern and rather stark design, and appreciated the lovely toiletries and luxurious shower.  Our one complaint was the lighting.  Although interesting, we found the room frustratingly dark after daylight from the window was gone.  Since all the lighting in the room is task oriented, it is almost impossible to find anything in the closet or in many other locations in the room not lit up.  A single light to illuminate the whole room, at least for those instances where you need to locate something, would be very helpful.",5,2012,11,24
40,"Book it now if you can, bless me later. ","Design, design, design and location. Oh, and great stuff to help you too. The dark colors where not welcoming at the entrance, but after we were sitted and served Cava on the check in, we knew it will be great. The junior suite was enormously big and equipped with huge bed and comfy furniture. The spa is amazing. Next time. We will replace the suite with a room. It's big enough (40 sm) and and won't suffer from the noisy street. The free minibar is a nice addition to an excellent stay . One of the best hotels I ever been in. More than recommend! ",5,2012,11,23
40,Great hotel,"Having just returned from an enjoyable holiday with my wife in Paphos I cannot speak too highly of the Alma barcelona hotel, we had no complaints at all. The friendly staff, excellent food, clean and well equipped rooms, numerous facilities and good position in fact the hotel was all that one could wish for. It is our intention to return to the hotel again in the future.",5,2012,11,22
40,Great location and wonderful stay,"Alma hotel is in a great location.  We walked to most places - La Sagrada Familia, Ramblas, great restaurants, etc.

The hotel lobby and restaurant area are a little dark and seemed like it would be a clubby twenty something kind of place, but we didn't encounter that at all.  I saw business people and tourist for the most part.

We had an executive suite and it faces the front of the hotel.  Although they say its sound proof, I could still here car noises during peak traffic times.  But in the evening, traffic dies down so I didn't have any problems sleeping.  Like the lobby, the room is on the dark side, but didn't mind it too much since we were out most of the day anyway.  It was a very spacious room, with two flat screen TVs, one facing the seating area and one facing the bedroom area.  The bathroom was large, all white marble, with separate shower, tub and toilet room.  The rain shower head had great water pressure.

The service was great.  They helped us with taxis, maps for walking to sites, train information for Montserrat, changing large bills to smaller, etc.  The breakfast was great.  You can do a full breakfast or if you just get coffee and pastry, they'll only charge for that. 

The last time we were in Barcelona, we stayed at Hotel Arts (Ritz Carlton).  I thought of staying there again, but it was fully booked for the dates we needed.  Because Alma is more centrally located and the hotel itself was very quiet, I would stay at Alma again.",5,2012,11,21
40,"The Three ""S"", excellent stay, excellent staff, excellent service","My wife and I had an excellent stay in the Alma Barcelona. All expectations were met and if we had to say something, it should really be little détails. We did not find shoeshine in the room (basic, but when you have to go to a nice place on the evening, that is something you always look at...). The breakfast in the room could be improved a bit by more choices. Same for the coffee from a breakfast perspective.... Between an Americano with more water than coffee and an expresso of the size of a ristretto.... They might be a balance ! 
Now, overall, this is an amazing place and the staff is really doing an impressiv job. They are always nice, accessible and doing their best to please the Customer experience. 

Great place, we loved it !",5,2012,11,19
40,Hotel Alma excellent,Hotel Alma was a lovely experience. Its rooms are super modern and the evening food and service was excellent. the staff suggested further places for us to travel and  really couldn't do enough to make our stay and subsequent travel a memorable holiday.Rooms were quiet and clean and very comfortable.,5,2012,11,19
40,Fantastic Hotel,"One of my favourite hotels in Barcelona. Very good located, it's clean, the stuff is really perfect, friendly and helpfull, i like the atmosphere very much. I booked my room without breakfast, so i can't say anything about it.",5,2012,11,19
40,An excellent stay with great service!,"The Alma hotel is modern, well located and has excellent, helpful staff. The concierge was able to give us helpful directions of how to get to Montserrat, put me on on the phone with Verizon to fix a smart phone problem and receommended three great restaurants. I would, without hesitation stay there again and recommend it.",5,2012,11,17
40,Great service and value,"I am always a bit skeptical when I read about the fabulous service at hotels.  Often it depends on who is working at the front desk and how busy they are.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the staff at the Hotel Alma.  We received a very warm reception on our arrival and throughout out stay.  There was always someone available to help with recommendations for dinner or to find us a taxi when needed.  We were greeted warmly every time we returned to the hotel.  There was always enough staff on duty to deal with all of their guests.  

The room was also a great value.  We had a large room with a sitting room separated from the sleeping area.  There was a lot of storage for luggage which meant that the room felt more like an apartment than a hotel.  The furniture was comfortable and stylish and the room was cleaned whenever we went out.  There was a large bathroom with a separate room with the toilet. The mini-bar was stocked with free water and soft drinks which was a nice feature.  The hotel is in a great area within walking distance to a lot of the famous Gaudi architectural spots.  Excellent breakfast (not included) with seating in an outdoor courtyard in nice weather.  

I’d stay here again without hesitation.",5,2012,11,16
40,Exceeded our expectations,"My wife and I booked room #310 facing the courtyard. I am a light sleeper and found the room ideal for my tastes. A very thick pocket door can be closed to separate the bedroom from the entry area, virtually blocking any sound from the outside hallway and the same type doors are available to close off the rear window area, creating an almost sound-proof room for sleeping. We enjoyed the minimalist style, very clean and functional, with pleasing texture and color. We can't say enough about how much we enjoyed the staff. The folks we encountered were young, energetic, extremely professional, very helpful, and instantly made us feel like friends instead of strangers. We found the location to be very convenient for our sightseeing and dining interests. The staff was very helpful in suggesting restaurants and tours. They were also eager to find out afterwards if we enjoyed their recommendations so they could stay updated and make adjustments for future guests. We dined in the breakfast area 3 of the 4 days we were there and found the selection of foods pleasing. Breakfast is pricey compared to the outside, but I believe one pays for the quietness and convenience, and it was well worth it to us. We especially liked the key-less room entry with fingerprint readers. No worries about losing your key! We would definitely return to this hotel in the future.",5,2012,11,16
40,"Great staff, perfect location",We wife booked this hotel for 3 nights and from start to finish the experience was perfect.  This was is a very modern and well kept hotel.  We always found great helpful staff that were friendly and always willing to help.  The location was great for moving around the city by foot and it was only a short step to the Passeig de Gracia.  Service was everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more.,5,2012,11,16
40,Amazing hotel!,"My husband and I spent a week at the Alma Barcelona.  From beginning to end it was perfect! Minimalist design in a traditional style building-the juxtaposition of old and new was great.  We were in a junior suite (#301) and it was spacious and lovely. Very quiet. Location is ideal-can walk to just about everything.  Most importantly, the service was impeccable-Michael, Mario and the lovely woman in the afternoon/evening (Apologies-can't remember her name) were friendly and eager to be helpful.  Their recommendations for restaurants were great. Breakfast was excellent, if abit pricey.  Did not have the opportunity to try out the spa unfortunately.  I would go back to this wonderful haven in a heartbeat and recommend it without any reservations.",5,2012,11,14
40,"Great location, excellent service, lacks atmosphere","I picked this hotel for a weekend break for my daughter and I. The decision was based on the hotel's location close to the main sights but away from the notorious pickpockets of the Ramblas; its very reasonable price for a 5* hotel; excellent reviews on this site; and its contemporary looks (which I thought a 20 year old might appreciate!).
The location was indeed great - about 10 - 15 minutes walk from the Placa Catalunya, close to good restaurants, shops and bars, and only a couple of blocks away from the Metro and airport train. We felt very safe in that area.The service we received was absolutely excellent - the reception staff could not have done more to help us feel at home and to get the best out of our visit with restaurant recommendations, travel assistance, showing us around the spa etc. The spa incidentally had a good sauna and steam room but the fitness room looked very basic and the pool was so shallow you would find yourself beached if you happen to be be quite generously proportioned!
The breakfast is expensive if you are not planning to make an enormous meal of it (25 euros each),  and if I stayed there again I would prefer to go to one of the cafes on the Paseig de Gracia a few hundred metres away. 
Having said that, the thing that would put me off returning was that I felt the hotel lacked atmosphere and was rather stark - lots of dark grey walls with 'functional' furniture'. The first morning we went to breakfast there was even rather funereal music playing in the lobby (though it was more upbeat the second day). We had a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard and I believe there may be rooms at the front which are more classically designed. However, despite the friendliness of the reception staff, as you walk into the hotel it feels rather sombre and unwelcoming in appearance. Perhaps it is aiming more for the business traveller than the tourist? Overall a good experience but I probably wouldn't choose it again for a weekend break.",4,2012,11,13
40,Perfect hotel!!,"We absolutely loved this hotel.  Stylish design, fabulous location, comfortable beds, great service and a quiet night's sleep. Perfect!!!!

The only cons were that they didn't have shower caps (handy for us ladies) and there was no door on our shower room, so if you're not travelling with a partner you have to avert your eyes.

We loved the location of this hotel as it is a block away from Gaudi's La Pedrera and Casa Battlo and easy walking distance from Sagrada Familia and the Gothic quarter.  It's off the very elegant Passeig de Gracia so you can enjoy an evening stroll with the locals the moment you step out of your hotel and is an easy walk to the more touristy La Rambla and Gothic Quarter.  This area is the optimal base for a Barcelona trip.

Other than the hotel - book your tickets to Sagrada Familia online and save queuing round the block. Also worth getting a BCN ticket special as the Gaudi museums all have entry prices of about EUR20/adult.

Eating
- Cervecería Catalana is great atmosphere for tapas but be prepared to wait at busier times.
- Torre d'Alta Mar has amazing views but VERY average food for VERY fancy prices.  If you want to enjoy the view of Barcelona go for a drink at the top of Hotel W or go for the night visit at La Pedrera and then go for dinner at a top notch local restaurant.  This is certainly not the place for good food or service.",5,2012,11,12
40,Great 5 star,"Very nice quiet discreet 5 star hotel. All dark wood low lighting and excellent staff all with good English and very helpful. We didn't have time to use spa etc as too much sightseeing. Only gripe is that at a 5 star hotel you would think they could include breakfast as this was EUR25 each!
Beds were huge and the most comfortable hotel beds ever. Very central only 10 mins walk from tube and then direct train to airport taking 25 mins.",5,2012,11,09
40,Great hotel!,"We have enjoyed this hotel the last couple times we were in Barcelona and have been very impressed.  It has great location, service, nice open concept rooms, and reasonable prices given how nice it is.  The service really stands out with a personal touch, you see similar faces who do a lot of the little things that many hotels overlook.  I'm also always concerned about bedding in Europe and this hotel is great in that area, crisp white sheets, non-split king beds, and down bedding.  Great find!",5,2012,11,07
40,Alma review,"It's a fantastic hotel in a great location. The staff are friendly, very helpful and very knowledgeable.They made our first trip to Barcelona special and memorable. The hotel room and the hotel itself is one of understated elegance. The bar is great and the restaurant is very good as well. It is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. I cannot recommend it enough.",5,2012,11,07
40,Charming,"Stayed at this hotel over a weekend in November. The hotel is situated in a central position with easy access to local transport and within walking distance to main attractions such as La Sagrada Familia (15 minutes walk). The rooms are clean, modern and spacious...and I loved the idea of entering the room by simply placing my finger on a sensor by the door. The hotel staff were outstanding! They helped us to plan our days, booked tickets for us and recommended great restaurants. Everything was done with a smile and you never felt rushed. This is an excellent choice and no doubt I will stay there again on my next trip to Barcelona.",5,2012,11,07
40,Tranquil oasis in Barcelona,"Thought the colour scheme a little dowdy on first impression but turned out to be wonderfully restful after the colour and chaos that is Barcelona.  Particulally liked the garden out the back to sit before bed and have a nightcap.
Our room was wonderful - great bathroom and plenty of wardrobe space.  The front desk staff were very helpful doing the online 'touristy' bookings for us.
Very central and made our visit a special one.
One word of warning though - no irons or ironing boards and ironing takes a day to come back!
Small problem though - just buy another shirt!",5,2012,11,06
40,Perfect service!,"We were met by pleasant personnel offering us cava even before we did check in. We calmed down immediately after a long flight.  A perfect welcome! Throughout our stay, the entire staff showed us an excellent service.  All our requests were pleasantly fulfilled with a smile.  We can absoultely recommend the fantastic massage threatment ""Voyage of Alma"" - fantastic.  Our room was great, quite spacious and modern.  The housekeeping did a wonderful job.  

This is an excellent choice.  We doubt if you´ll find a better hotel in Barcelona.",5,2012,11,06
40,Beautiful!,"Stayed at this hotel with my family. It is a beautiful hotel in a really central location. It's really close to 2 of the main attractions in Barcelona, the Gaudi houses, and not too far away from La Rambla. The hotel staff were fantastic and very knowledgeable about the surrounding restaurants and always recommended a new gem every day. Well worth the price.",5,2012,11,06
40,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"I stayed in Barcelona for 3 nights and I reserved this hotel without reviewed first. It was opened almost 2 years, so it is practicly new. All I can say I was really surprised.
-Great Staff 
-Excellent service
-Outstanding food
-Spacious and Clean Rooms
-Perfect Location
-Hi-tech, 
etc, etc....
What else can you ask? Really looking forward to my next visit.",5,2012,11,05
40,Alma Amazing,"For a perfect trip to Barcelona....you can't beat the Alma.  Walking into the lobby after several international flights.....it was as relaxing and welcoming as could be.  From the incredible contemporary decor....to the perfect service and best location in the city....it made my first visit to Barcelona truly memorable.  In the vein of a 2012 take on Philipe Starck...albiet warmer and friendlier....(and if you like that sort of club lit feel)...then this place is for you.  Why doesn't every hotel have a fingerprint (keyless ) room entry system.  That alone tells you that have gone to extra mile and thought of everything.  
We booked the executive room and it is worth the exta money for a nice seating area and wonderful bigger bathroom. (we thought the prices were reasonable for a hotel of this caliber) 
Not everything is perfect.   Lay your clothes out for the evening during the day as the room lighting could be better.  And the rooms on the back side of the hotel will be much quieter than the street side (although it really wasn't an issue on the 5th floor)  
The front desk staff was went out of their way to say hello and make sure we were having a great stay.  Ditto for the bartenders in the cozy back bar. 
Breakfast is expensive but there are so many options in the neighborhood, its not really an issue.  The gym (how about a few pieces of equipment in the empty room) and spa in the basement are a bit strange but there is a wonderful gym just 2 blocks away that the front desk reccommended.  Really.....so much is walking distance, from the Gaudi buildings to fantastic shopping,  we walked almost everywhere.   A can't reccommend this hotel highly enough.   Thank you Alma B.",5,2012,11,04
40,Hotel Alma in October,"Outstanding service, the staff did go out of their way to ensure we had a perfect stay.
Take the time to visit the Parque Guell, and buy tickets for the cathederal from the bank ATM and save a 3 hour wait.
We look forward to the next visit.
Thank you",5,2012,11,02
40,bad stay,"""An establishment with its own personal character, the Alma Barcelona is ideally located to provide peace and tranquility whilst still being in the heart of this cosmopolitan Catalan city.
The elegant atmosphere of this hotel ensures a feeling of luxury that is both subtle and yet refined."" 

This is how the hotel defines them selves on the  website - but it could not be more far from the truth.

We were staying in barcelona 3 night - business / relaxing time  - and wanted luxury and a quite hotel close to the city  - we arrived thursday around noon - one room was ready the other not - had to wait 2h for my room.

we went to restaurant to get something to eat - staff was not very elegant or luxury minds - more why are you bothering us - go away.

after lunch we went to the spa - small but ok - i drank a bottle of water - the empty bottle was still there 2 days after ! 

i finally got my room - nice room - when opening the window there was a lot of noise from the building next door - construction workers - very stressful - had to closed window - was there all day - not very luxury or 5 stars like.

had a meeting saturday in restaurant at lunch - shortly after we sad down, 20 - 30 people came in a had some sort of mass lunch - very noisy and not very ensuring the feeling of luxury  - the waiter ignored us most of the time - again.

we will off course never return to this place - and cannot recommend it to anyone.

 - only good thing about it  was cleaning of the room - very 5 star and luxury style -and also the no_key_concept - very 5 star luxury.

- other than that - at this rate it is far from ""ensures a feeling of luxury that is both subtle and yet refined.""  - noisy - arrogant waiters - no luxury over the service - an not very subtle and refined - very bad, for us !",2,2012,11,01
40,Excellent,"Stayed at Alma Barcelona for 5 nights . Had such a great time. Rooms were clean, spacious  and very comfortable. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They were so friendly and helpful giving directions, making recommendations and so attentive when attending to us. ",5,2012,10,31
40,Can't get any better than this!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Alma for 6 nights. From the moment of our arrival the staff was friendly and professional. We were escorted personally to our room and all our questions were answered about the room, the spa, and restaurant. 
We used the spa almost everyday. There is no cardio equipment but Pilates mat, weights and bands. The sauna and steam rooms are awesome. Great pool too! 

The hotel is well located. We walked everywhere- The Borne, Barri Gothic, port area, Plaza Catalunya.

The beds were so comfortable. The only negative was the lighting in the rooms and in the lobby area. Also the price for breakfast was SO expensive!  Tasty but expensive! We found other places to eat breakfast. 

We love this hotel. The staff is superb! We will return to Barcelona and will stay here again",5,2012,10,28
40,Felt like Bond - James Bond,"Great location and wonderful modern room with a Bond vibe (finger print entry worked great!) a welcome start to our trip after a long overnight flight from Toronto.  Our room was ready and we were able to shower and jump into bed for a quick jetlag nap before starting our touring.  Staff very welcoming and accommodating - loved everything about the Alma.  Great location in Barcelona - close to whatever you need.  Would recommend!  Great for a couple - the bathrooms are unusual in a good way but if you're shy, just a warning that there aren't any doors on the shower area!  Maybe not so great if you've got kids with you.  It was perfect for us and we'll stay there again if we hit Barca again.",5,2012,10,28
40,Up to it's reviews,"When choosing the Alma Barcelona for my recent vacation in Barcelona, it's all the reviews about the staff that made me choose this hotel.  I can tell you that the staff live up to all the great reviews posted on Trip Advisor.  I asked one of the clerk at the desk to buy online a ticket for the Sagrada Famila. We tried but my PIN didn't work in order to complete the transaction with my credit card.  I went to a ATM nearby to try to buy the ticket but it didn't work as well.  I went to back to the hotel and explained my problems to the clerk. She then decided to use her own credit card, completed the transaction online, received an email on her cell giving her a code to have the ticket printed, when out to the same ATM, had the ticket printed and came back to the hotel to give me the ticket which I reimbursed her immediately. Thanks to her, I could avoid a long wait to visit the Sagrada Familia.  They also got me a ticket for the FCB game against the Glasgow Celtics and the ticket was amazingly well placed.  They gave me good recommendations for restaurants, help me planned a trip to Montserrat. The location of the hotel is just perfect, 15 min walk to the Sagrada Familia, the Predera is just one street away and the Rambla Catalunya one block away. The room was comfortable and the rainfall shower was amazing. It's a must when staying in Barcelona and the Alma Barcelona lived up to my expectations and even more.",5,2012,10,27
40,Enjoyable stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the Alma.  Everyone we came in contact with, especially Marco, was very friendly and helpful.  It was great that we were able to check in on our early morning arrival from the US so we could shower and change after an overnight flight. We did not eat there or use the concierge service. My husband did use the steam room in the spa one morning, but otherwise, we did not use the spa or pool.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom large, bright and modern.  Our room was on the front of the hotel so there was a lot of street noise late into the night but we were always so tired from touring that it did not keep us awake.  We were able to walk to a lot of tourist sights and even walked down to the port to eat on the water one day. It is also very close to the HoHo bus stop.  The only drawback we had with the hotel is how dark it is inside.  Our room was so dark that we had to use a flashlight to see the numbers on the room safe.  The walls, woodwork, and ceilings are painted a dark blue and the wooden floors in the room are dark.  Even the hallway is very dark, which I really did not feel comfortable with.  We had a very enjoyable stay there but next time in Barcelona I would probably look for a hotel with a more traditional interior and a lighter decor. Thank you Alma staff for your friendliness and warmth!",5,2012,10,27
40,an experience to remember,"Stayed at this beautiful hotel during trip to Barca for football was welcomed like an old friend right from the start.Staff were friendly and very helpful,and spa was very good thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this beautiful hotel.",5,2012,10,27
40,Great location,"We stayed here for the second part of our Barcelona trip. The location is fabulous. The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. The fingerprint ID system for accessing the room worked poorly. The rooms are minimalist rather than opulent but are nicely done none the less. The amenities in the room were different than what we had been given on our other hotel stays - no toothpaste, tooth brush or shower cap were available or provided. It's hard to call it a 5 star - I think 4.5 is a better approximation but I will ""round up""",5,2012,10,26
40,Mixed Bag,This is a great hotel in an excellent location.  Reception staff extremely friendly and helpful. It is luxurious with high quality fittings but I found its monochrome colourscheme rather soulless and dull. The spa was very hot and poorly ventillated with a low ceiling and no windows which I found extremely claustrophibic. The gym is just a hot room with no exercise equipment. The pool was a lovely 18m long but only 2m wide and about 0.5 m deep.  Worst of all we booked a double room but got 2 twin beds pushed together. Its impossible to have a romantic weekend when one of you is constantly falling down the gap between the beds!,3,2012,10,25
40,Amazing Staff!!!,"Prior to our trip to Barcelona I spent months researching hotels to stay at while in Barcelona. The Alma definately lives up to its 5 star rating. The hotel is simple and elegant. No large annoying signs or pushy reception people. My wife and I had a suite and it was amazing. Enough can not be said for the staff. Our airlines lost my luggage, the language barrier made it very difficult for me to find out where and when my bags would be arriving. Once I mentioned my issue to the hotel staff, they handled the situation and kept me updated until my bag was hand delivered to my room. Prior to arriving, I spoke with the concierge and asked to have flowers delivered for my wifes birthday. Not only did they have a beautiful arrangement waiting for us upon arrival, they also arranged a chocolate plate in our room. It is a great hotel to relax and unwind in. As for the negative comments that have been posted, I feel sorry for these people because they missed out on a great experience. I was on vacation, so I am glad there was no business center. The staff is willing to print out anything that one would need. They made suggestions on resturants, as well as made the reservations, printed me out a map either walking or driving or called me a cab. A must while in Barcelona and we will be back.",5,2012,10,22
40,Perfect central location,"From the moment we walked into reception we were made to feel especially welcome in a friendly, relaxed way, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. It was a nice touch to sit at the check-in desk and sip a cold glass of cava as our concierge took details. The superior room  was spacious, minimalist, quiet (a real feat for Barcelona) and very clean.  There is even a free in room mini-bar (not alcohol, but water, soda and juices) which is replenished daily.  The rainfall shower with uber cool Malin and Goetz toiletries was the ultimate in luxury.  Spa area on ground floor had sauna and steam room, fluffy bathrobes, all top class.  
We didn't eat there but did look at the breakfast buffet and there was plenty of choice.  All in all three days of bliss!  What more could you ask for?",5,2012,10,22
40,Great location and service,"A perfectly located hotel, understated luxury. Staff tries hard but a few shortcomings which need to be fixed if you want to justify prices and 5 stars! No business center, check in and concierge at same small desk ( 2 people) so to check in or check out.. queues! not acceptable. Buffet breakfast good at 9 am but lacking later, staff tries but not always ""with it"". Rooms are big and very quite if on courtyard with wonderful view of Pedreda.",4,2012,10,21
40,Perfect plalce,"it's nice to return to ALMA and feel pretty sure about that the standard still are high  .. and indeed .. everything was exceptional.. Super personal service, Beautiful rooms (especially the beds are amazing)
So if you are understated luxury, and a place where there are no smart people showning off in the reception, then Alma is the spot ..

We will be back for sure ..",5,2012,10,20
40,Gorgeous,"This gorgeous modern hotel is one of the most sleekly beautiful I've seen. They offered great service and despite their sophistication, all of the staff, from the window washer to the concierge, were super friendly and accommodating to us and our (admittedly delicious :) rambunctious baby.",5,2012,10,19
40,Excellent hotel but where are the cupboards?,"Lovely rooms quiet and cleaned daily. So minimalist could not find the cupboards! breakfast is excellent good choice and very fresh. Location of hotel is excellent amenable to good bars and restaurants.

More information for guests would be helpful for example the breakfast menu and procedures for hot choices as it was not clear on what was on offer. Also information on dinner booking was not available.",4,2012,10,19
40,Great hotel with big room and awesome service,"We just stayed at this hotel lately and really enjoyed it. The check in is very welcoming with smiles and cava! Thank you for upgrading us to a nice and big room! The hotel has awesome location. That is one of the main reason we picked this one. The room is big and clean and modern, plus super quiet, a big thing for us. Loved the shower! The only thing were the feather pillows that I wasn't use to, a bit too soft. Great stay, and service was the best. Everyone we met is super helpful and nice. From restaurant recommendation, to translate the text on a bottle of medicine we bought for our little boy's stomach, felt like we are really well taken care of all the time. We also enjoyed the swimming pool a lot. 
Loved our stay, and will definitely go back.",5,2012,10,15
40,Fantastic service and rooms,"Location of hotel is excellent and our suite was very large, extremely comfortable and very well designed.  Given the location it is very quiet in the room and the only sound is the air conditioning.  Food at breakfast was a very good standard and we ate in the restaurant which was also good.  What makes the hotel extra special though is the staff.  We wanted tickets for the football and they did their best to get us the very best seats for which we were very grateful.  Plus they recommended and booked some great restaurants for us and were always very helpful and friendly.  One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.",5,2012,10,13
40,Minimalist design with outstanding and honest service!,"Like many I booked this place because of the ranking on TA and it lived up to expectations.....and then some. It is well priced, and very close to the Main Street, and a Gaudi building too.
The thing that was the best was the helpfulness of the staff on the front desk from suggesting perfect restaurants and cafes to dine at, but also helping with reservations, best places to shop and pretty much everything that you could wish for....nothing was too much trouble and the service and the genuine nature of staff was outstanding.
When we arrived they walked a though a map of the city, as we'd not been before, this was helpful, they suggested places to eat, based on what we said we wanted, as well S shopping, and historic sites to see.
 The room was lovely, very simple but spacious. Great bathrooms and the bed and pillows, possibly the best I have ever had at any 5 star hotel.
I loved the breakfast but that is because I like muesli which seems to be a task to find in Europe, but the continental breakfast is outstanding (buffet) with all the pastries, juices, fruits, yogurts etc you could want need....there is no hot options but you expect that with continental....if you want an omlette etc, go to cafe Emma a few minutes walk away....this is excellent if you need a host breakfast, and they have their menu on the website.
The only thing that let Alma down, we arrived about 4pm and our room was not ready....It would be ready in 25 minutes. We were given a complimentary drink, but really it wasn't the best start to the stay....but the only thing that wasn't perfect, so I can't really complain hence leaving the ranking high.",5,2012,10,12
40,Most helpful concierge staff,"Everyone was super sweet and helpful. They told us what to ask for in the pharmacy when my husband was sick then gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne when he was feeling better! They gave us great suggestions for thigs to do and they called restaurants, spas, etc., and made all our reservations for us. ",5,2012,10,12
40,Top Class Hotel with Friendly Service,"Me and my wife stayed at the ALMA Barcelona for three nights.  Here are some of the highlights:

-- The hotel's location is hard to beat, right in the heart of the glitzy Eixample, and just one block from the Pedrera and a few from the La Sagrada Familia.

-- Hotel's staff is professional, curteous and above all, extremely nice. They remembered our names and always had a smile on their faces.

-- Room service is excellent and the food is as good as any in Barcelona, which is saying a lot as the primary purpose of our trip was to enjoy Catalunyan food, which is among the very best in the world right now.  After dining at El Celler de Can Roca, we still enjoyed the amazing food here at the hotel.

-- Good value for money. Its pricey but its very comfortable and the key-less finger print entry system is worth the price of admission alone.

Loved it - cant wait to return.

It is a little bit on the smaller side as far as full service hotels go but it is in a great location, and the staff is exceptional. 
We stayed in a suite which was quite nice and very roomy with a large bathroom. The suite is not truly divided into two rooms which would have been nice, but it was comfortable and contemporary. They do not have a proper gym either or any gym equipment which would have been nice, but if that's not important then it's not a problem.
If you choose to have your breakfast there, it is quite good though maybe a bit pricey.
Overall, the staff made the difference for a great stay in Barcelona.",5,2012,10,07
40,Best hotel I have ever been to,"My husband was attending a conference and I came along with our four year old. I really love this place. Stylish and beautiful. In the middle of everything but a true oasis of tranquility. The hotel is so beautiful that I would not want to go home ;) The very polite staff really know what excellent service means. They really make you feel welcome.

Downstairs pool area is really stylish and practical if uou want your morning swim or need something to do with kids in the evening. Garden is a lovely place to sit and have a dinner or drinks. The hotel is only a year old so everything is in good condition. 

If I would change something then I would add more lamps in the room. The room (Classical Executive Suite) was to the street but the windows are so well isolated that we accidently slept too long :) Luckily I didn't have to work! 

I would also adjust a little bit the vegetarian options of the menu in the hotel restaurant. I am a picky vegetarian and the dishes are really nicely designed and they look fabulous. But still I look for food that is both delicious and balanced vegetarian. 

Rooms to the garden are modern as that part of the building has been added later. I like the effortless chic style of this place. ",5,2012,10,05
40,An oasis of tranquility,"This hotel is an oasis of tranquility in the very busy center of Barcelona, located just next to Passeig de Gràcia, behind a very discrete facade.
This is the place to go to if you want impeccable service, very nice big rooms with selected design furniture, and a less is more approach to almost everything ...
People looking for flashy and int your face luxury look elsewhere ...

Perfect , could not fault it ...",5,2012,10,05
40,Wonderful hotel to stay in Barcelona,"Wonderfully different hotel, with a very accommodative staff.  The location is great for exploring the city and enjoying local cuisine.  Many noted landmarks are within walking distance and the retail areas are high quality. Try it for yourself, I believe it will be a great experience.",5,2012,10,04
40,Sublime Just Sublime,"My husband and I just returned from a ten day visit to Barcelona and The Alma.  Truly don't know where to begin.  From the front desk staff (family!) to the most comfortable bed and pillows on earth, we were the happiest we have ever been in a hotel...and we travel a lot.  Barcelona is so bustling and alive that walking into the Zen quiet and peaceful beauty and environment of the hotel is like a massage for the senses.  The muted earth-toned color palate and minimal design added to the immediate sense of stillness.  Because we were there for ten days, we got to spend quite a bit of time with the lovely folks at the front desk and in the dining room.  No pretense, just good people who really want to please you.  The room we had, on the fourth floor front, was very spacious and sparse.  I have never been one to necessarily value the sparse, minimalist look, but it became a great source of peacefulness.  At times I wished the lighting options had offered something brighter, particularly when we were getting ready or packing.  The room was so quiet that we literally never heard one guest ever.  So if your priorities are peace and quiet and really great people, this is your hotel.  There are many 5* hotels in Barcelona that we visited that are pretentious and over the top - just doesn't appeal to us.  Another strong point is the central yet a bit off the beaten path location.  The neighborhood is very elegant; shops and restaurants/cafes abound.  The insulation and air conditioning sound (almost a noise reducing sound)keeps street noise to a minimum.  We had breakfast there many mornings, which included personal service, eggs to your taste (caramelized onions and wild mushrooms, anyone?) along with fresh orange juice and breads, pastries and al the fruit you can imagine.  Barcelona is expensive, yet you can have cheaper and lighter breakfasts very nearby if you want to avoid the 25 euros.  We never ordered room service.  We had a couple of incidents with a couple of rude and unhelpful people in the bar and food area, but over the ten days, it averaged out to superb.  We are foodies, so it seemed to suit us to do most of our food research ourselves, but we did ask the concierge to arrange for reservations.  We are returning to Barcelona and will definitely stay at the Alma.  Wish we could take it in our back pockets to other cities we visit!  Three cheers and five stars!",5,2012,10,03
40,"Excellent hotel, Great Service, Terrible Spa","The hotel is in an excellent location perfect for shopping and nightlife and within easy reach of all the attractions.  The hotel is very minamilst, low lighting and cool atmosphere.  The rooms and beds are very comfortable and the shower was amazing.  The service is perfect, couldn't be faulted, doors opened for you, staff ask if there is anything you need, turn down service etc.  

The only negative is the spa which is 2* standard at most.  The spa area appears very worn.  The steam room didn't appear to work and the tiles were worn and dirty.  The Sauna was an extreme heat and the gym consisted of a bench, a couple of weights and a pilates machine.  I considered the spa to be unsafe a light fitting was plugged into the wall (into a loose socket with a long wire attached) hanging from the ceiling right next to the pool.  I am sure this does not meet with health and safety regulations to have plug sockets and light fittings in this situation.  Other plug sockets around the spa are loose from the wall and the ceiling is exposed brickwork which appears to be unfinished.

If you are looking for a clean modern hotel with good service the hotel is excellent but if spa facilities are important then I would look elsewhere.",5,2012,10,03
40,nice and good serverce as well,"very nice place 
and in pleasure to logger there and they also giving  good service  
they let us feeling warm and very friendly
we forgot very import things in the room and left they contact us and send them to us 
real thanks for their honest",5,2012,10,02
40,"Exceptional Service, will definitely be back","We recently wrapped up a 3 week stay in Europe by a four night stay at the Alma Barcelona and it was a fitting end to a perfect vacation. We opted to spend a bit more and upgraded ourselves to a suite and it was worth every penny.

The pros
* Location, location, location! Located steps from the trendy Passeig de Gracia and 20 minute walk away from La Familia Sagrada. Also steps away from Casa Batilio and La Pederada. All of the tour buses stop less than 5 mins away from the hotel so it was so convenient to hop on and do some sightseeing.
* The Staff were friendly, helpful and always seemed so eager to help.
* Welcoming glass of cava upon arrival.
* We stayed in Room 412, it was a suite  with a street view and it was phenomenal. 
* Large room and large bathroom
* Two tvs in suite one in bedroom and second in siting area.
* The turndown service with fresh towels and water by your bedside every night was excellent!
* The garden patio was phenomenal and just the place that you needed to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing. 
* Great modern design 
* Free mini bar
* Lots of options for breakfast
* Great Bar for drinks

Cons
* I could find none",5,2012,09,30
40,Fantastic hotel,"This is the best value in all of Barcelona!  What a perfect location right off the P de G.  The staff was unbelievably friendly and so helpful. The rooms and hotel are ultra modern.  It was quiet and beautiful.  The rooms are a generous size and the beds are very comfortable.  The only quirky thing is that the bathroom is just  divider in the room and the large shower doesnt have a door.  Beyond that, this was the most amazing hotel to stay in especially the value.  The minibar was included and free in room wifi.  Perfect.  Originallybooked the Mandarin, but why waste the money.  Go shopping or have an amazing dinner at Tickets for what you saved.  Would definitly return.  Our room on the 6th floor faced the rooftop of the Gaudi building.  Can you imagine looking at those structures morning noon and night.  Unbelievable!",5,2012,09,30
40,Quiet location!!!,"We stayed at The Alma the end of August for 3 nights...........
Good location
very nice staff, and helpful with any questions
quiet room
comfortable bed
free juice and soda in the mini bar, was also a nice touch
would definitley stay here again and recommend to friends",5,2012,09,29
40,Dont go there if….,"you are looking for Glamour and coloured crowed, busy lobby and loud music. But if you want to enjoy the best location, the most quiet hotel with the most helpful staff don't miss the Alma hotel. Extreme modernism, a lot of black and grey but great design. Perfect location, excellent breakfast, incredible garden in the middle of the city. Negative aspects, their Spa is also minimalist, hot and humid  when they would have plenty of space to built it in the garden. Dont go anywhere in Barcelona.",5,2012,09,29
40,"Great location, best staff",Alma Barcelona is in a perfect location - close enough to walk everywhere.  Staff goes out of their way to take care of you and made our room available early which was appreciated after the overnight flight.  Free mini bar was a nice touch and housekeeping was superb.  The only recommendation is for better lighting in the room.,5,2012,09,28
40,relaxing hotel,"Just recently stayed at Alma and had a lovely stay.   Room very minimalistic but very comfortable and housekeeping had it immaculate every time we returned late afternoon c/w clean towels and water by our beds, a treat to go back and rest your feet before the next outing.   The free refreshments in the mini bar was a nice touch.   Would definately return.",5,2012,09,26
40,Clear winner,"A top notch hotel you can make as your central base of operations in Barcelona.  Not one thing I can complain about.  This is a true 5 star hotel!  Staff all very helpful and pleasant.  Concierge was terrific and helped us find great things to do and places to go.  Located in an upscale area near all shopping and culture, I highly reccommend staying here.",5,2012,09,26
40,Very enjoyable experience,"I booked this hotel based on what I read on Tripadvisor and once again I was not disappointed. Very friendly and helpful staff, quiet and peaceful hotel in an excellent position.. Couldn't have asked for more and I'll be going back to Alma next time I am in Barcelona.",5,2012,09,25
40,Such service and comfort,Even check-in was a treat with a glass of sparkling wine.  Our room was gorgeous with beautiful glass & marble shower large enough for 4 and the beds were so comfy.  The service was impeccable and helpful with every question.  I can't wait to return to this marvelous hotel and city.,5,2012,09,24
40,Loved our stay at Hotel Alma Barcelona,"This was our first stay in Barcelona.  We really enjoyed Hotel Alma.  Staff were all friendly, helpful and professional.  The room was clean and spacious.  It was nicely furnished in a modern, minimalist style.  
We had a number of meals in the courtyard.  The meals were all very good.  Service was also good.  
The location is very good, within walking distance to Casa Mila and other landmarks.
We plan to return to Hotel Alma.",5,2012,09,24
40,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is fabulously decorated - very contemporary - the bar and lounge area are really nicely decorated and the outdoor garden is lovely too.  The staff are all very professional.  Our room was smaller than I expected given that I reserved a grand deluxe, but I suspect that's what you get in a city centre location.  Room decor was very nice, but - very strange feature - double bed had two single duvets which was a little odd.  Also, for such a nice (pricey) hotel, we were surprised that there was no music dock in the room, so no way to play any music at all.  

Anyhow, the location is amazing, virtually on the corner of Mallorca and Gracia, so really good from that point of view and would definitely go back.",5,2012,09,23
40,Tranquil and calm in the heart of Barcelona,"We decided to stay at the Alma for three days based primarily on outstanding tripadvisor reviews and they were so accurate.  The front desk staff were, without exception, friendly, helpful and prompt.  The room was tranquil..so quiet, calm and serene in atmosphere. The bedding was the most comfortable I have ever experienced in hotel setting. It made the six hour time zone transition painless.  The only caution for travellers used to a North American meal time is the scarcity of options for food outside the Spanish routine.  Room service starts at 8pm.  

The location made walking easy to all of the major sites we wanted to see in Barcelona..a wonderfully beautiful city to visit.  It was the perfect start to our European vacation.  I highly recommend the Alma for visitors seeking an exceptional place to stay.",5,2012,09,22
40,Excellent Stay,"Great quiet , fine location. I really liked the shower . Very crisp fresh bedding, large screen TV.Attentive helpful staff. 

To tell you how great the staff was here. I accidently left a wad of cash in the safe but didn't realize it until I has at the airport with a flight leaving in about an hour and a half. I called the hotel they opened the safe and had a driver bring the entire amount to me at the airport. This to me is the mark if a truly excellent institution. I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and the people who work there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2012,09,21
40,I would rate it Number 1,"We are enjoying every minute ! The staff here are all very helpful , the Hotel is very modern, you even enter your room with your own finger print. The rooms are spacious , beautiful modern architecture, huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet. And situated in the middle of it all . A place to come back to !!",5,2012,09,21
40,"Serene, lovely, retreat in bustling Barcelona","Large, spacious , airy very modern room, relaxed immediately after a long trip.
Staff is wonderful---very outgoing---glass of Cava while checking in seated----neighborhood is elegant---convenient to all attractions---hop on, hop off bus 2 blocks away. Did not eat in the hotel---had coffee in the morning at lovely coffee shop ( Il Forneo ?)one block away and had dinner on 2 nights seated outside at clean, delightful restaurant  (5 Jotas) one block away---superb Iberian porK----fortunately it was open Sunday night also.

40,excellent recent visit,very helpful check in staff.  location excellent for walking to major restaurants & sights.  rooms very spacious and clean. Beds were very comfortable. The hotel was in as  very safe lo locale and easy to find.,5,2012,09,20
40,Beautiful hotel in great location,"Stayed for one night, will stay longer next time. Great check in experience, beautiful room, love the fingerprint access system which saves carrying a card or key. Small but functional fitness room with TRX straps which more hotels should have, also a Pilates reformer. Lovely breakfast although the waitstaff at breakfast were not nearly as helpful or friendly as the other hotel staff. ",5,2012,09,17
40,great hotel,"we had a lovely greeting when we arrived at the hotel.our room was lovely and big without us feeling to confined,great big bathroom as well,it had a pretty courtyard and a lovely lounge.it was in a quiet street which our taxi driver found a bit confusing.the only gripe i had about the hotel was the bar and restaurant staff,i found them very unwelcoming and would wait a long time to be served.not what i expect from a 5star hotel,the courtyard and lounge also was used as the restaurant which i found very odd.they did not start serving dinner till 8pm.they were not even laying a table until you sat down at the table.the young waiter who served claimed he was very busy the night we had dinner there,he only had four couples to serve,not good enough.sort your restaurant staff out.all in all a great hotel but not for eating and drinking",5,2012,09,17
40,Amazing hotel and perfect location,Rooms are large and clean and staff is very accomodating....Easy to walk to major attractions including Las Ramblas and Sagrada Familia...Quiet location yet close to everything....Nice semi-outdoor courtyard to catch a drink....Free minibar of juices and water restocked daily was definitely great after a long day and good for mixers.,5,2012,09,16
40,Catalunya,"First trip to Barcelona; Staff at Alma were extremely helpful and resourceful.  Good advise on restaurant recommendations.  Hotel is tucked away from the busy crowds but close to the action.  Overall a nice experience, hotel very clean and nice atmosphere, but perhaps lacked some international flare as when I stayed there all the guests were from US, Great Britain and Australia.",4,2012,09,16
40,Nice modern hotel in excellent location,"Stayed at Alma pre and post cruise. Very well situated, close to major attractions. Hotel staff were very helpful and available to assist. Room and bathroom were spacious.  The only thing we had trouble with were the lights and tv controls; they were slightly confusing to operate. Also, it seemed like the outlets' power turned off during the night, as we had to switch phone charger to another outlet in the middle of the night or in the morning when we woke, as it was no longer giving off power. This happened each night. Overall, we did like this hotel very much and would stay again. Well priced in excellent location. ",5,2012,09,16
40,Loved it (except for the gym),"The Alma is near perfect. A tranquil, stylish, luxurious haven in a busy city. Greeted on arrival with a big glass of excellent Cava by the delightful reception staff (who later booked sightseeing for us and recommended excellent restaurants), we were then shown to our very cool room (fingerprint opening instead of room key)! Minimalist luxury and comfort. Pitch-black at night and silent, whispering air-con, super comfy bed and fab pillows. Huge marble bathroom with two sinks and enormous shower and bath. Superb breakfast, lovely bar area including beautiful floodlit garden. I never sleep as well as I slept here. Only one moan - the gym and chilly pool are very basic and need a re-think - it seems as if they don't belong in this otherwise perfect hotel.",5,2012,09,16
40,Beautiful hotel with exceptional staff,"A wonderful 3 day stay at this hotel in Barcelona.  Well located, close to the metro and in a nice neighborhood.  The staff are fantastic and extremely helpful.  On checking in, we were given a glass of cava and the staff took the time to help orient us to the city and provide any information we needed.  They were more then happy to help book tickets, provide suggestions etc.

The hotel itself is great, modern, but not too big which gives it a personal feel.  The only criticism I have is that there is no door on the shower (which seems often the case in Europe) - leading to water all over the bathroom afterwards.  But a small flaw in an otherwise great room",5,2012,09,16
40,a great hotel,Our experience at the Hotel Alma in August 2012 was a great one; the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  This made our stay in Barcelona more memorable.  Their advice about where to eat and which sites to visit was excellent.  The hotel itself is modern in a cosy sort of you.  Not what we usually go for but we really liked it.  There is a feeling of space throughout the hotel.  We stayed on the 4th floor in a room facing the garden.  It really was superb! Breakfasts were great as well.  The garden was a lovely treat after a full day's walking.  The location of the hotel was perfect for us.  Passeig de gracia is grand wide avenue full of high end shops with many restautants just off it .  It was nice to be not too close to las ramblas which is very busy(only 10 minute walk).  barcelona exceeded my expectations.  a truly wonderful city!,5,2012,09,15
40,Perfect!,"We enjoyed our time at the Alma! Any hotel that greets a weary traveler with cold bubblIng cava is terrific in my book! We had the pleasure of a 2 night stay in September 2012. The hotel is a good base for walking to the sites and is set just off the noisier street so it is quiet. The court yard is a terrific haven for a cool refreshment after a full day of being a tourist. Room service, bar service, and breakfast were all positive experiences. ",5,2012,09,15
40,A great hotel on a good location,we were there with young children and enjoyed our time. They were very helpful and great with the kids. Having that said I would say in general the look and feel are more of a business hotel type than a family hotel. The service is great.The architecture of the hotel is fantastic and the outside garden very quiet and a way from busy city life.,5,2012,09,15
40,Nice hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights, and had a good experience. We had a suite. The whole hotel was extremely modern, but in my opinion had a very cold feel. I prefer to stay in more traditionally decorated hotels.

Here are the pros:
Good location, 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas, and right off the Passeig del Gracia (shopping drag)
Quiet and clean rooms with comfy beds and bedding
Free mini bar with drinks
Friendly and very helpful staff, unparalleled 
Nice turn down service
No need to carry a room key, use your finger print to enter and exit

Cons:
Open shower that leaks water everywhere giving the bathroom a musty smell and feel. There was a bit of mold at the base of the shower doorway. 
The room seemed very dark all the time even with the lights all on , the whole room was painted a dark blue color, even the ceilings. The lobby was always dark as well.
The light switches were impossible to figure out, sounds strange...stay there and you will see for yourself 
The shower head is the rain type where it comes from the ceiling, I hate that
The waitress in the restaurant had a bad attitude 

Overall, we had a nice experience. I'm not sure if I would stay here next time or opt for something more traditionally decorated, but I would most definitely recommend this place to friends and family.

40,Hidden Gem in Barcelona,"The Alma Barcelona is a very fine hotel.  Service is truly outstanding.  The staff anticipate your needs and make sure that your expectations are exceeded.  While no taxi driver had ever heard of the hotel, once you've stayed there you will never forget it.  It is very well located in an excellent section of town, a block from Gaudi's La Pedrera.  The minimalist style of the hotel contrasts nicely with Gaudi's perspective on art and architecture.",5,2012,09,13
40,Fantastic Service puts Alma above the rest,"The service at Alma will remind you of a Ritz Carleton.  No ask is too great and they find a way to make it happen.  A little disappointed at the service received at the breakfast bar (lady running the breakfast had an attitude, uncharacteristic of the rest of the staff).  All of the front service staff is amazing and speak perfect English.  Rooms are private, quiet, and have many of the luxuries of home.  Pool, steam room and sauna are amazing and really set this hotel apart.  Allot of rooftop bars in the area if you’re in need of a nightcap, plus the hotel has an excellent bar as well.  Free wifi that worked well enough to access my email like I was at the office.  If you want to be in this district in Barcelona, Alma is the place to stay.",5,2012,09,13
40,Service is Everything,"This hotel receives wonderful reviews. And deservedly so. So I struggle to find any negatives. The design of the hotel is minimilistic and modern. Which is great. But it means that lighting in your room is dim. Fine for mood but not for reading or in my wife's case putting on makeup. The air conditioning controls were beyond me and we were reluctant to impose too much on the staff to explain what no doubt was obvious to most ! That's all I can think of by way of negatives.
The positives. The room was great. Very comfortable big bed. We were on the 6th floor overlooking the courtyard and looking towards the top of one of the Gaudi buildings. The shower was excellent and cupboard space was good. A free mini bar is unheard of and a nice touch to put you in a positive mood. A shoe clean free of charge was another nice touch.
Servicing of the room was excellent. Great towels. A bottle of water next to the bed at night.
We had breakfast out but breakfast looked good. On return from a day of walking a drink in the courtyard was soothing and relaxing.
But having a nice comfortable room is what all good hotels should do. What separates this hotel is it's staff. An example. On 11 September we had booked dinner at Tickets at 7:30. It was Catalan independence day. It was reported there were 1.5 million people in the city. We were conscious of getting to our restaurant in time. The staff made enquiries which determined that our trip could take a little longer than might be expected. We went to the lobby at 6:45. Paul from reception walked with us for three blocks to find a taxi in the non moving traffic. Having hailed a taxi he ensured the driver would get us to our destination which on this night meant circumnavigating the city. On return to the hotel Paul rang Tickets to ensure our reservation was not lost. We got to Tickets and had a great meal. I have never heard of a hotel attendant walking three blocks to help us find a taxi. I thought it was exceptional service. But one example but typical of our stay.
I highly recommend this hotel. Location is great only 50 meters from the Paseig Gracia. To the old section of the Rambla and the old part of town is a good 20-30 minute walk depending on your destination. When we travel we walk so none of the distances worried us. However within minutes of the hotel is the up market stretch of the Rambla and the prestige shops . And no shortage of restaurants and cafes.
I hope you enjoy your stay.",5,2012,09,12
40,Slick and Cool,"Conveniently located near the Passeig de Gracia train/metro station and very close to excellent shopping. 

I was not disappointed! The service is friendly and the staff are extremely helpful from the arrival  at the front door. Check-in was very smooth and personalised.

The hotel is well designed with ecellent sized rooms, clean and comfortable.

40,"Style, Comfort and Professionalism - Great Combos for An Excellent Stay","This property is conveniently located 3 blocks from the Passeig de Gracia train/metro station on a quiet street (Mallorca) off this main avenue packed with upscale shopping.  It is also situated two blocks from the Rambla and a couple of Gaudi's architectual beauties.  The Sagrada Familia is a few blocks walking straight on Mallorca.

Upon entering the Alma you are immediately impressed with the style.  It is dark, but the darkness soothes.  The staff is very professional and pleasant.  We were greeted and checked in by Miguel, who was a delight.  We were served a glass of cava, upgraded to a bigger room and he went out of his way to answer all of our questions with a smile.  We particularly liked the polar bear painting in the reception area.

The room was quiet, spacious and spotless.  It was lean on decor, but had just the right touches for a very comfortable stay.  The bed and bedding were great and the shower was roomy.  The minibar is stocked with water and juices, all free of charge.  The property has it's own restaurant and spa, but we did not try them.  There is breakfast for a fee, but there are so many nice cafe's all around, we opted to try a different one each morning.

There are just a couple of quirks that were not a problem, but of note.  Firstly, the toilet is located separately from the rest of the bathroom.  The lighting is excellent, but there are way too many light switches.  It took awhile to finally figure out that one of them was the main that shut off everything.  There is ample storage and drawer space, but the single knob on each drawer is stubby and very hard to pull out.

I would definitely return and recommend staying here.",5,2012,09,12
40,Style with personality,"This hotel completely surprised me by combining extremely stylish/modern facilities and look with 100% personalized service. The check-in staff was extremely charming and helpful, not just during the check-in process but throughout our stay when we needed help with directions, shopping tips and printing travel documents. (which they ran up to my room and left on the desk while I was drinking wine on the terrace) Great rooms with fantastic toiletries, fingerprint access, lovely outside terrace, great location... this hotel really impressed me. Highly recommend.",5,2012,09,12
40,"Painfully cool, stylish hotel in a great Barcelona location","Check-in was very smooth and extremely personalised. Staff were extremely helpful from the minute we arrived at the front door. The property itself is quite striking and very well designed. Apparently it’s supposed to feel like a traditional Barcelona style town house, which it kind of does. 

The rooms are large and comfortable – and very clean. The toilet in our room was in a separate room and was massive for some reason. There was no tub but a double rain shower, which didn’t have any kind of guard/curtain so water went all over the floor. The toiletries were fantastic – so good we spent money ordering some when we got home. 

The free mini bar was a nice touch and had a selection of soft drinks in it. We didn’t eat at the hotel but did use the restaurant/bar on the ground floor for a coffee. This was possibly the worst part of the hotel – service was incredibly slow and was almost non-existent. Staff were simply not around. 

The fitness facilities are incredibly basic, with no machines or weights – just a room for stretching, which was disappointing. The pool and spa facilities are beautiful though, if impractical. 

The location of the hotel is fantastic and it’s very easy to get around town on foot. It’s a quick walk from Diagonal station so easy to get to from the airport. 

We had a fantastic weekend stay in Barcelona and this hotel is fantastic for that sort of weekend trip.",5,2012,09,11
40,Excellent!,"We found the hotel through tripadvisor and we were not disappointed! The service is amazing, the best we have had in a long time. Friendly and great staff that would help you with everything during your stay. Big rooms, clean and comfortable. Very nice lobby and super location for shopping. Although near the busy passeig de Gracia, it's quiet and comfortable - especially the court yard at the back. The food at the restaurant was ok, not amazing, and the gym is tiny. Other than that - excellent in every way! We would definately stay here again. ",4,2012,09,10
40,Delivered on its excellent rating,"My wife and I visited the Alma for 4 nights in July for an anniversary trip sans kids.  We read the reviews and came with high expectations.  The Alma and the staff delivered. From the James Bond-esque fingerprint access to the rooms to the generous free wifi and daily stocking of the room fridge with drinks and sodas to the wonderful attitudes of the staff our time at the Alma was magnifica!  We loved Barcelona and the Alma.

The only downside is the very expensive restaurant.  But you can still enjoy the lovely courtyard on your own and they are very happy to recommend other restaurants.",5,2012,09,09
40,Beyond expectation!,"Just spent five wonderful nights at this lovely hotel. Everything is almost perfect. Staffs are extremely helpful. The gentleman at the front desk whom did my check-in (i sincerely appologise for forgetting his name) spent a lot of times explaining about the city and where to hunt for great food. Location of the hotel is good not in the busy La Lambla area. It is very easy to go around as tourist - very near hop-on hop-off stop, 2 mins walk to metro, taxi (some taxi may not know the hotel but it is on the main street that all taxi know regardless) or even walk to many sites. There are many good restaurants not far from hotel (even 2 stars Michelin one which was so good!). The only draw back is not to have cardio equipment in the gym. If you want clean, modern, spacious, quiet and great service in good location, this is the hotel! ",5,2012,09,08
40,Faultless,"This hotel is wonderful.

Respect it and treat it well.

Staff are friendly, unobtrusive and helpful.

Hotels as good as this should be wrapped up in cotton wool and given a cuddle of an evening.

Perfect.",5,2012,09,06
40,Searching for a design comfortable and well located Hotel?,"This charming hotel is so discreet that taxis do not know it! Yet it is very well located and you feel so comfortable in its modern and minimalistic design. Staff is very friendly. Rooms are spacious. Breakfast is a buffet : variety is fair, essentials are there in particular the awesome Alma chocolate paste. The only negative point is that our rooms (101 and 102) were noisy maybe it is the case of all rooms on the street side. ",4,2012,09,05
40,"perfect location, great staff","My family of four stayed here for 3 nights in late June this year. We booked two rooms and when we checked into the rooms that were just opposite the lifts, we were worried that the corridor might be noisy but we were pleasantly surprised that it was peacefully quiet throught the day and night.

A great boutique hotel with contemporary minimalistic decor, this hotel is a perfect location right in the heart of Barcelona with good walking distance to Passeig de Gracia where all the shops, restaurants, cafes were. We walked so much that we found Casa Mila, Casa Batlo, La Rambla on our first day. 

Two unique features about Alma Barcelona are the finger-print keys and the free room minibar. The rooms were spacious which we appreciated especially with the long benchtop to put our luggage and everything else so that the room floor would not looked so cluttered. Comfortable clean beds with clean bathrooms. Nice verandah overlooking the courtyard.

The Front Office staff were very helpful and courteous and they doubled up as Concierge staff as well. They were great in helping us locate places and kind enough to print out maps for us to bring along to the taxi driver. We were extremely grateful that they allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel (after heaps of shopping in Barcelona !) while we went on our cruise. When we came back after a week, they were nice enough to help us load our 10-12 pieces of luggage onto the car transport.

Take note of the Italian resturant just opposite the hotel. Great pasta. We enjoyed it so much that we went back there for two dinner nights. Will definitely go back to Alma Barcelona.",5,2012,09,05
40,Great staff!!!,"Amazing hotel, in heart of the city, perfect location.  Great rooms and hotel ambience (except for the gym). But easily the best part of the hotel is the front desk who double as concierge, they were INCREDIBLY helpful sometimes spending upwards of 40 mins helping me to plan the day, find the right sights, food, bars and directions.  I had one take my iPad map my entire day with the map feature adding notes- simply AMAZING!!! They gave the best recommendations, made my trip to Barcelona that much more memorable. Heart filled thank you to the staff!!!",5,2012,09,03
40,Fabulous.,"An absolutely fabulous hotel in a great district of Barcelona, close to lots of the sights and within easy walking distance to other areas.  In fact, we walked all the way from Barceloneta back to the Alma one day which didn't take too long.  The thing that stood out he most was the absolutely first rate service which all of the staff provided; nothing was too much trouble, whether it be booking restaurants secure last minute reservations, or recommending restaurants and places of interest to visit.  Some aspects of the hotel don't necessarily match up to other five star establishments, e.g. the spa, however, this really didn't matter given the fantastic and friendly service, the position of the hotel and the comfort of the rooms.  Awesome city hotel.  Recommend highly.",5,2012,09,03
40,Lovely hotel at the corner of the shopping district,"Brand new hotel. Rooms are furnished in ""minimalist design"" stryle but use of wood + exquisite taste of the design makes it a perfect place to stay. Splendid breakfast buffet. Staff friendly and helpful. Would recommend booking a room with a view on the patio (as I did) rather than on the street. It's not a cheap place but definitely worth the money.
Only concern: the fitness room is barely equipped and really not up-to-par with the rest of the hotel. Staff told me improvements were planned soon.",5,2012,09,02
40,Awesome. Just awesome.,"Modern luxury minimalistic hotel at the heart of the city. Everything is closeby! The famous Sagrada Familia is just 15 to 20 mins walk. Casa Milla is only a few steps away from Alma, also Casa Battlo. Awesome grand finale in my recent trip. You use your fingerprint to enter the cozy spacey room. Big bathroom as well. The double rainshower is superb. Although I only had one night in Barcelona but I truly enjoyed my stay at Alma.",5,2012,08,30
40,Superb boutique hotel in Las Ramblas area!,"After reading all of the reviews for Hotel Alma, I decided that we had to stay there for a couple of nights during our trip to Barcelona! It was fantastic. We experienced some flight delays leaving the Canary Islands and arrived at 5am in the morning. The bed and bedding were so comfortable, we drifted off to sleep and then got up around noon. Before heading out to sightsee, we spent some time in the spa area...using the swimming pool, steam room and sauna which was amazing for tired travelers!

The front desk was amazing with recommendations for a nearby lunchspot and giving us some ideas for an easy walking tour. We walked from the hotel down to the waterfront which was amazing and full of life on a Sunday afternoon! Having a mini-bar in the room for a quick drink of mineral water was a ""nice to have"" for busy travelers!

The front desk also made us dinner reservations and let the restaurant know that we were celebrating my birthday. But the best part was the guys at the front desk helped my boyfriend surprise me with a HUGE bouquet of flowers in my room. After we left for dinner, the guys set-up the flowers as a surprise for me. They also put our names on the guest list at the Eclipse Club at the W so we went to one of the busiest clubs in town and were on the VIP list, thanks to the Alma Hotel for making my birthday so much fun and so special!

I would highly recommend the Alma Hotel, it is truly a home away from home in Barcelona!",5,2012,08,30
40,"Excellent Service, Rooms, Location","Alma is a new comer on the scene in Barcelona as witnessed by the fact that not a single cabbie knew of the place when we were there this June. It has however earned a truly well deserved place at the top of the rankings for Barcelona luxury hotels in relatively short time. The location is great for exploring the city while staying in a charming and central neighbourhood, (something which Ramblas is definitely not). The rooms were spacious, modern and well maintained. But most importantly was the service, which went above and beyond in helping us in every way during our stay. truly wonderful young staff, helpful and friendly and polite at all times.  given the price, I would stay here again over the Mandarin Oriental, which I find to be its direct competition close by.",5,2012,08,28
40,Hotel Alma: Hidden Gem in Barcelona,"It was difficult to find but once you're in the Alma, it's all worth it. Upon arrival, you're greeted with a glass of Cava and smiles from the friendly staff. Alma is ideally located very close easy walking distance to the popular destinations in Barcelona. The room where we stayed is a superior deluxe, very well appointed, charming, and filled with luxurious comforts. The architecture of the dining area is very modern, the terrace is perfect for a peaceful fine dining experience. But Alma's best kept secret are its staff. Everyone was very professionsl, helpful, and friendly. They all go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and problem free. I wish I could remember all their names so I could thank for all their help. On our last night, we decided to have a good dinner and so we asked for help in making the reservation. It was August and most of the places were closed. Miguel suggested L'Etapes. It was a perfect suggestion. That dinner capped our fabulous 4 day stay in Barcelona. Thanks Miguel.",5,2012,08,28
40,"Hotel Alma - Great Stay, Wonderful Hotel and Staff","We stayed at the Hotel Alma in July of 2012. The location is terrific, just steps from Passeig de Gracia and two blocks from Avenue Diagonal, main shopping areas that contain lots of stores of all types and many restaurants and indoor and outdoor cafes. The staff is wonderful, they are completely helpful, knowledgeable and answer all questions and make suggestions about the local area. They can also arrange a number of tours for your party. Would definitely recommend and will stay here when we return.",5,2012,08,27
40,our 3 day stay in Alma,"As per my daughter's recommendation we decided to choose thie hotel for our 3 day stay in Barcelone.
The hotel is very well located and has lots of charm. Most people working there are very friendly.
our room was comfortable and spacious but the bathroom not having a door was a little anoying! one person taking shower would certaily disturb the other person resting in the bedroom!
The toilet was nice but without sink to wash your hand! you had to go to the next door bathroom to wash your hands after toilet!!!
Since this is a relatively new hotel, let's hope the management will improve the service  and everything in time.
Overall a nice place to stay in when in Barcelone.",4,2012,08,27
40,Very modern hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Alma is very modern hotel right off Ave. Garcia, thus giving it a great location.  The staff is quite helpful and made some very good recmmendations.  (Wish the staff wore name tags so we knew their names.  But everyone was great.)  The rooms are spacious with a minimalist approach to decorating.  Lay out of bathroom is funky but we liked it (just wished all rooms had bidets).  Rooms were quiet (got to sleep in until 11am and still thought it was 7 am because of how quiet it was). Bedding was comfortable.  Breakfast buffet was nice plus you could order things from the 'grill'.  Hotel has a small indoor pool (filled with ice water I think) and very small gym.  The sauna and steam room are nice.  There are many nice places to stay in Barcelona and this is one of them.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2012,08,26
40,Best kept secret for business lunches,"Steps away from Paseo de Gracia, on the quieter side of Mallorca st., The Alma Hotel 
holds a surprise behind its very discreet facade. Walking through its impressive refurbished lobby and past their cocktail bar is one of the best interior courtyards in the city. The zen-like terrace is well designed and filled with greenery which makes it feel like an urban oasis amidst one of the busier/commercial/touristic parts of town. You can sit back and enjoy the stillness of its atmosphere in the lounge or have a productive outdoor business lunch without any noise or fuss.  Great backdrop for intimate evening corporate events too.
Apart from its unique location, the food is actually quite nice. Probably one of the best Salmorejo
 ( Andalusian Gazpacho) in town and also a great dessert offering. Whether it is a burger or a steak tartar your having, food at Alma is not inexpensive. However  its quality and is well worth it. Also noteworthy is the service. Extremely friendly and generous for Barcelona's standard wait- staff quality. I would dare say I booked a second time for lunch thanks to the enthusiastic attitude of a waitress. Tucked in the core of Barcelona, Alma is definately worth a visit.",5,2012,08,23
40,Top Hotel With Exceptional Service & Great Location,"We stayed at The Alma for four nights in early August on a City break. We chose the Hotel based on excellent Trip Adsviser reviews and were not disappointed.
When we arrived, the room was not ready but we sat with the Lady at Reception & had a couple of glasses of Cava while she pre-booked the attractions and restaurants we wanted to go to.
The Hotel is super modern with finger print entry to the rooms - no hassle with having to get the key card changed when it comes into contact with the phone! The decor & comfort were really exceptional & could not be faulted.
The staff were absolutely exceptional and always went the extra mile on suggestions, getting taxis, directions, etc.
The Hotel is located very close to the corner of Mallorca & Passeig De Gracia which is the luxury shopping Street. This to me is a far better location than The Ramblas (10 minutes walk) which is much brasher and noisier. Many of the bars, cafes & restaurants in this area seem to be frequented by locals with better variety and value than The Ramblas.
Diagonal Metro Station (with access to multiple lines) is 5 minutes walk away as is Place De La Catalunya in the other direction.
My only issue was the Hotel breakfast. This is not included in the room rate but charged at 25 Euros per head. I found his pretty insubstantial with better value to be had in many nearby cafes. In all fairness though, The Spanish are not big on breakfast which for most locals seems to be a coffee woith croissant or baguette.
The Alma is not inexpensive but the service, facilities & comfort are really worth the money and I would not hesitate to return.",5,2012,08,22
40,Amazing Hotel,"I booked this hotel as a treat for me and my partner for my birthday. From the moment you walk through the front doors the welcome and service you receive is incredible. The hotel is amazing, beautiful rooms with a very modern feel. Completely sound-proofed so you feel like you're the only guest!. Our room overlooked the gardens, which again, were impecable and lovely to sit in and read in the afternoon sun with a drink from the bar. Breakfast was pricey but you can choose from a vast selection of food and drink, so we did on one occasion. No keys to worry about as everything is accessed with your fingerprint! Great central location, within easy walking distance of all the sights. I love this city and this hotel. We will definitely go back.",5,2012,08,22
40,"Beautiful, Centrally-Located Hotel","We stayed at the Alma for one night on our way back from Minorca in August 2012.  The hotel is beautifully designed and the rooms are large and well-appointed.  Everyone on staff was exceedingly helpful, from the bellhop to the front-desk staff.  It was a short stay, but we had a lovely time - you can't beat the location.  We would stay again.",5,2012,08,20
40,Great Hotel,"This hotel is very modern and futuristic regarding the technology, i was a bit surprised. Very nice holiday spend with my big family (5 rooms). Staff were very helpful and friendly. Location can't get better for first time tourists to Barcelona as it is close from Rambla street.",4,2012,08,20
40,Peaceful Stay at the Alma,"Just spent 12 nights in the Alma Barcelona Hotel on a business trip and it was just fantastic.  A perfect location for walking the city and surrounded by top notch Tapas bars.  The lobby is sleek and spare.  Quiet descends on you when you come through the front doors.  After getting your finger print key at check in (they have chilled beverages and even champagne if you want it during the check in process), you can sit in the almost silent garden and have a light lunch or drink before going up to your room. I stayed in two different rooms over the course of my stay, and while the decor is a bit austere in style, the rooms are beautiful and comfortable, well laid out and had plenty of closet and drawer space.  The bed and bedding were delicious and cool to come home to after the heat of an August day.  My first room was on the top floor and faced the street. It was quiet but the windows did not open. My second faced over the courtyard, windows opened and it was also serenely quiet in what can be such a noisy city.  The food at the hotel was excellent. The breakfast abundant and very, very well done. From fresh squeezed raspberry, mango or orange juice to cheeses, meats, all kinds of great yogurts and beautiful fruit. The hotel is spotless, the gym is really a small work out room with limited equipment and a warm and lovely lap pool is down there too.  If you need a roomful of machines, this is not the place for you.  There were many of us traveling on this job and the hotel did an amazing job of getting us all checked in early after our flights.  I have to warn you that the service in the dining garden can be a bit slow.  With that being said, I had breakfast sent up on many mornings and it showed up exactly at the time I asked for it.  So beautiful hotel, great rooms, wonderful service and delicious food.  I would most certainly stay here again and again.",5,2012,08,20
40,An oasis in Barcelona,"Stayed here in July for 3 nights and had a very positive experience. Staff were very knowledgeable and helpful, even providing a glass of Cava whilst we checked in! It is in a great location, round the corner from La Pedrera, Gaudis' apartment block and within walking distance of the Sagrada Familia and La Rambla. The outside bar is a lovely tranquil spot to relax after a days sightseeing. The staff gave us restaurant recommendations every evening which were good quality, without being overpriced. We didn't have breakfast as it was pricey, preferring to walk to one of the local cafes around the corner on Passeig de Gracia. The room was very comfortable and quiet, the free mini bar of soft drinks was a nice touch. I wouldn't hesitate to go back to the Alma, an oasis in a great city.",5,2012,08,16
40,First Class from start to finish,"We found this hotel via Tripadvisor as we do quite a few city breaks and we like to find different places rather than the chain hotels which are the same wherever you are.  The Alma is a beatifully designed hotel that is not too small but with a very personal service.  We were there for three nights and were warmly welcomed and our room was available early so we were able to settle in before setting out into Barcelona.  The room was beatifully appointed and  spacious with quiet air conditioning and a large bathroom with bath and walk in shower and separate wc.
The hotel is ideally located for the main shopping areas and near enough but not too close to the Ramblas, Sagrada Famiglia etc.

The staff were extermely friendly and very helpful in their recommendations for restaurants and attractions.  Pau on reception in particular gave us very good advice on getting about in Barcelona.

In a city centre hotel outside space is always welcome and the quiet garden area at the rear was ideal for relaxing and was also where we had dinner one night and breakfast each morning.

A must nowadays is Wi-Fi that works - the service in the Alma is excellent and extends to all areas and the rooms.  It is also free which makes a pleasant change.

We would recommend this hotel every time for a Barcelona visit",5,2012,08,16
40,A cut above,"the staff , service, quality of food and rooms were really outstanding. the location is so perfect being central to Los Ramblas and the main shopping roads . it also very near the beach (follow one long road to the marina) and to the Gaudi sights. The cathedral is on the same road as the hotel.  Fantastic stay!",5,2012,08,16
40,Could not have been better.,"We had originally booked Hotel 1898 but cancelled due to a couple dodgy recent reviews and an uninspiring call with the hotel.  Having walked past 1898 on the tourist trap that is Rambla and spent 3 nights at Alma it was a great decision.  

As soon as we walked into Alma the doorman grabbed our bags and the receptionists welcomed us and offered drinks.  Fingerprint detection on the doors was novel.  

Rooms are spacious, light and airy.  Slightly odd that there is no shower privacy - this is a hotel for couples really.  TV is HD and wifi free.  

Restaurant and bar recommendations were spot on.  The staff are correctly snobby about sending their guests to tourist traps, preferring to send them to popular places close by that are high quality, well priced and frequented by locals.",5,2012,08,15
40,Great Holiday,"Stayed here recently for 3 nights.  Room was very spacious and the bed was very big and comfortable.  Free minibar and drinks (soft drinks and water) were restocked once a day.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  On our last day our flight wasn't until 10.30 pm.  We were able to leave our bags for the day then return later and use the spa facilities to freshen up before we went to the airport.
Location was great.  Very central to Diagonal and the metro.  Also handy for the bus tour stops, attractions and restaurants/ bars.
Was expensive to stay but definitely worth it.  Hope to stay here again.",5,2012,08,14
40,"Modern, minimalist hotel in a favourable location with good service","Our family chose the Alma for our 3-night stay in Barcelona and were very satisfied with the offered. My husband and I had a Grand Deluxe Room going to the courtyard garden and our son had a Deluxe Room next to us. The rooms were really spacious and well-appointed in a minimalist style. The bed was one of the most comfortable we ever had in a hotel and the walk-in shower was a hit. There is free wifi in the rooms and drinks in the mini-bar (soft drinks) are free. Also the rest of the hotel, which has a little more than 70 rooms, is kept in a modern, minimal design. We liked it very much but of course it doesn’t appeal to everyone’s taste. It is situated near Passeig Gracia and Plaza Catalunya (shopping district) and only 3 minutes away form a subway station (Diagonal).Upon arrival we were welcomed by three friendly employees, each of them carrying our three suitcases, and were offered a glass of Cava. We could choose from a regular access to our rooms or from one via fingerprint where we went for the latter and this was really a gadget that facilitates your (hotel) life, you never have to look for your key … There is (as mentioned) a nice courtyard garden where you could have something to eat or to drink, a placid place far from the bustle of the city. We had breakfast there and enjoyed it. There was a small, but well-arranged buffet; eggs, hot drinks and freshly squeezed orange juice could be ordered by the staff. The employees were courteous and helpful without being intrusive. There is also a spa with a nice pool and a somewhat special fitness room (no machines, only ropes hanging from the ceiling). On balance, the Alma is recommended for demanding travellers appreciating minimalist design and good service, and to top this off, it is reasonably priced.",5,2012,08,14
40,A jewel in Barcelona,"Alma is centrally located, not ostentatious but low key & very, very good.  The rooms are spacious, well equipped and attractive. The bar is sensational and sit outside in the garden if you get a chance.

The staff are very knowledgeable and willing to recommend hotels etc. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and this ranks highly with the best. I prefer smaller, more intimate hotels and this fits the bill perfectly.

The big test is would I stay again & the answer is YES

It is the kind of  walking distance to all the major attactions",5,2012,08,13
40,Good looking hotel with little substance,"Elegantly designed hotel, very Barcelona, with greys and blacks dominating. Good rooms, but let down by a very limited room-servce menu and un-focused and inefficient restaurant service. Useless gym, but at least you can jog on the Diagonal.",3,2012,08,13
40,An absolute treat! Best hotel I've ever visited,"This hotel truly justifies all the great reviews. 

It's absolutely ideally located for sightseeing in Barcelona and everything about the place is fantastic. 

Great Staff, lovely Spa, Massive Rooms, Great TV in the room.

It isn't cheap, but you can see what you're paying for. 

I rate this as my best hotel ever. Nuff said. ",5,2012,08,12
40,Not ideal for families due to hidden charges!,"We booked 2 rooms at Alma for 2 adults & 4 children through Expedia and we received an e-mail from Expedia that Alma was ""unable to accept your reservation for your upcoming stay"".  I immediately called Expedia and I was told the 2 rooms could not accommodate 6 people despite the fact that I was told that they could when I booked the rooms.  I was prepared to make alternate reservations but the Expedia Lodging Specialist called Alma to seek clarification and I was told they would be able to put a roll away bed in each room.  I was never told that there would be a cost of 60 euros per night per room for the roll away beds.  We checked into the hotel and we were never made aware of these charges & during checkout we were presented with a bill of 720 euros (which is equivalent to ~ $900 US dollars).  We were extremely disappointed that the full cost of the two rooms was never disclosed to us.  If I had known in advance that there would be an additional $900 cost, I would have changed my reservation.  Regrettably, we ended our two week European vacation on a low note and we continue to feel deeply resentful and disappointed.  The Alma receptionists told us that the cost of the rollaway was clearly stated on the Expedia website however the website states that roll away beds are not available therefore they misrepresented the information to us.  The hotel was simple but nice however the rooms were always damp and there were no doors for the shower room.  This hotel is not ideal for families.",2,2012,08,10
40,"Central, quiet and luxurious","Just returned from a two night break in Barcelona where we stopped at the Alma. It's suberbly situated for fans of Gaudi; La Predera and Casa Batllo are around 5 minutes walk away. The Sagrada Familia took about 25 minutes.The hotel is swish and contemporary and the staff all spoke fantastic English and were always helpful but never snobbish. The breakfast buffet, although a little steep at 25 euros was delicious and it was wonderful eating in the setting of the beautiful spacious courtyard. The room was large, comfortable and quiet; I am often put off staying at hotels becuse of the banging doors and noise from other rooms but no problem at all here. All in all, the nicest hotel I have ever stopped at and it was quite a wrench to leave.",5,2012,08,07
40,"Great hotel, had a wonderful time here!","We stayed in Alma for 3 nights, and had a great time. The hotel is situated in a nice neibourhood, with plenty of restaurants and shops around. It is walking distance to Casa Batllo and La Pedrera. 

The hotel adopts a minimalist style, and achieved it with flying colour. Upon entering the lobby, the place oozes with style. A glass of cava at check-in was a very nice touch, and the finger touch technology for opening room doors was the icing on the cake, hubby was suitably impressed by that. 

The room is very nicely decorated, again, the minimalist style flows. It is extremely spacious with a large bathroom, and plenty wardrobe space. Our room faced the courtyard, and even though it was on the first floor, I could not hear anything from the garden at all once when I shut the wooden shuttles. It also blocks the lights out completely.

The garden area is very relaxing, and you don't hear any traffic noise at all, a true oasis in the middle of a city. We ordered glasses of wines while we sit there in the evening to rewind, and they were very reasonably priced for a 5* hotel. In fact, they were much better value than any cafe's outside. 

We are sad to be leaving Barcelona and Alma. We would definitely return to Alma if we come back to Barcelona again.",5,2012,08,07
40,Fantastic gem of a hotel right in the middle of everything,"This hotel is fanstastic.  We found this hotel by reading all the great reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed.  It is modern, without being too modern.  The service was over the top. The staff were helpful and charming.  They always had a smile on their face. The hotel was spotless, the rooms were quiet and big.  The location was to die for.  What was there not to like about this hotel? 

I loved the check in process.  The service desk was so welcoming and always with a smile.  I also loved the fingerprint system used to get into our rooms.  We didn't have to have room keys.  All we needed were our fingerprints.  It was refreshing to not have to dig around in our pockets for the room key.

This was truly a wonderful experience and made our 3 day/ 2 night stay in Barcelona even more special.  We plan on staying here again the next time that we are there.",5,2012,08,06
40,"Intimate, Charming, and Welcoming","We stayed in the Alma for 4 nights during our recent trip to Barcelona. We were admittedly very surprised with earlier reviews which found the establishment to be below average. We found the hotel to be excellent and better value for money than the Mandarin Oriental, which we usually are fans of from our travels. The Alma is a minimalist designed hotel which may not appeal to everyone’s aesthetics. For us, however, this suited us perfectly. 

The room we were given was quiet, large, decorated tastefully, and had a comfortable bed, which was what we needed after days of sightseeing (We faced the courtyard and had a glimpse of La Pedrera’s rooftop too). The showers worked fine – never did we encounter any of the problems that earlier reviews complained about, and while it did have an ‘open concept’, it never bothered us. The internet connection was included in the rate, and so was the mini-bar, which was replenished daily. I found this inclusion to be especially welcoming, given that many 5-star hotels such as MO and FS continuously make the (problematic) claim that charging for internet in 5-star establishments is ‘common practice’. We only ate in the restaurant once for dinner in view of the fact that there are so many options in Barcelona (as a digression, we had a meal at Sant Pau and it was divine!), but we have to say that it was still very good. What we also appreciated was the unassuming staff – from the Front Desk to housekeeping – in particular Miguel at the front-desk, who provided warm, friendly, and professional services throughout our stay. Lastly, as mentioned in the other reviews, the location is excellent – near Passeig Gracia, Plaza Catalunya, and other Gaudi landmarks, which makes it a remarkably convenient place for the fantastic shopping and sightseeing Barcelona is famous for.",5,2012,08,05
40,Modern hotel with great location,"We spent 5 days in this amazing hotel in July. Spacious room and very comfortable kingsize bed, relaxing atmosphere, wood-and-leather design. Lighting system is great.There is no private parking, but hotel can provide a place at public parking for 30 EUR per day. We left our car and got it back at check-out. Concerning fingerprint system to access the room I have no chance to use it, my hands are often wet and system doesn't recognize it(regular key can be used too).Alma is definetly great place to stay in.",5,2012,08,05
40,"Hotel Alma, Barcelona","Very personal, helpful staff, well located and has a good restaurant. I would recommend it to other travelers on holiday in Barcelona. A little dark inside. Nothing else to say aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",5,2012,08,05
40,A wonderful hotel wIth super friendly / helpful staff.,"The  hotel  was  modern  and spotless. The rooms were quIet. It was only a short walk to the metro. Most of all, the  staff  were friendly  and very helpful with lots of great restaurant suggestions. As a place to stay in Barcelona the Alma is truly a great choice.",5,2012,08,03
40,Absolutely amazing and quiet!,"I'm writing this review while still at the hotel. This is an incredible place, as great as the other Trip Advisors claim. Its modern design is clean, crisp, and yet exudes an incredible warmth too. Starting from the lovely welcome at check-in, to the James-Bondian fingerprint key system, to the beautiful lobby, to the large room with high ceilings, a large, super-comfortable king-sized bed with a duvet like a cloud and large, comfortable pillows, HD TV, AC, free wifi, a free mini-bar which is restocked daily with waters, juices and sodas. Really nice, large bathroom too. A nice spa with pool, steam room and sauna. The furnishings are lovely, with simple clean lines and the whole hotel is very, very clean. The best part though is that the staff goes out of their way to be charming and helpful. Our room overlooks the courtyard in the back where you can have breakfast or afternoon drinks or dinner, or just hang out. This is a VERY quiet hotel, yet near most of the main tourist areas. We walked about 15 minutes to the Sagrada Familia. The Casa Barllo is about a 10 minute walk. The metro (subway) is close so you can get to other neighborhoods like the Gothic quarter or the Ramblas easily without having to actually stay in those busy areas. The neighborhood around this hotel is a bit like the Champs Elysee in Paris -- fancy, bustling, but not crazy. We did not hear any noise at all while in the hotel. We've traveled all over the world and stayed in nice hotels -- this hotel is one of the best we've been at. Not extra-fancy, nor snooty, but very welcoming.The hotel price is comparable to other nice hotels around the city, but I really can't imagine that any other hotel is this great for the price, location, design, comfort and fantastic staff. I would stay here again anytime and HIGHLY recommend it.",5,2012,08,03
40,An oasis,"The Alma is as good as earlier reviewers have indicated.  The staff was helpful, friendly, competent.  We felt welcomed from the moment we came in the door and every time we came back into the hotel for the 4 nights we were there.  It is a different kind of aesthetic from the typical,hotel, sort of zen monastery if the monks were into luxurious beds, excellent showers, free beverages in the mini bar (very nice that) and very cool keyless door locks.  We skipped the very expensive breakfasts but took advantage of the bar for a pleasant drink in the afternoon.  There are many breakfast options within a block or two.  The location is excellent for the Segrada Familia and Gaudi buildings, less so for the old city restaurants and Picasso museum.  But the subway is easy and frankly, we walked everywhere anyway.  Don't miss tapas at Catalonia, a couple of blocks away-- which the staff at Alma recommended.",5,2012,07,30
40,Excellent hotel,"We found the hotel to be in a great location within walking distance to most of the tourist attractions. The rooms were modern, with very comfy beds. The staff ( especially Pau) was very helpful in all aspects of our visit, from advising us about restaurants,transportation, and the local attractions to helping us plan for an overnight trip to the Pyrenees. The breakfast was plentiful with nice variety of food, though I felt it was overpriced. My only negative is that the fitness center really isn't much, though I got adequate exercise walking.",5,2012,07,30
40,Recent Alma Hotel Experience,"This is an incredible find. The staff were uniformly attentive, kind and helpful with all of our needs. They went way out of there way to help us navigate Barcelona and ensure our comfort. The property is peaceful, quiet and elegant. There is a ground level terrace that is a lovely place to retreat to, especially in the evenings. We hope to return someday.",5,2012,07,29
40,I Love Alma!!!,"Dear Alma staff...you rock! Thank you for the best Barcelona trip I have experienced yet. As an American living in Europe, I am spoiled and humbled...traveling to my fav European cities multiple times throughout the past five years. You took such great care of my family when we visited in March 2012..we will definitely return to stay at the Alma. Not only did you guide us with great restaurant suggestions, but your friendliness was unsurpassed. We fell in love once again...not just with Barcelona but with your beautiful hotel and your most excellent staff. 

Dear fellow traveler...the Alma appears minimalistic and very modern when you first step over the threshold. Don't be fooled by first impressions. The staff are far from Minimalists when it comes to customer service. The rooms are very well appointed and large by even American standards. The beds are excellent...not rock hard, as you will find in many European hotels...but just right. Bulgari bath products to pamper yourself. Breakfast selection was the same each day but plentiful. There is no buffet...the staff simply serve you when you arrive. You may order eggs which is included in the price of the breakfast. Of course, all European hotels charge a small fortune for breakfast each day...so this is typical and to be expected. There is always the option to find breakfast out in the city. 

I felt very pampered at Alma and even relaxed, in spite of the bustling city just outside the door. I cannot recommend the Alma enough. It is not a low budget hotel but I most definitely felt my Euro was well spent. The fortunate traveler who visits Alma will not be disappointed.",5,2012,07,29
40,Alma stay July 2012,"At first I wasn't sure about the minimalist look and feel of this hotel, although very soon we felt so comfortable with the whole experience. A lovely hotel with excellent customer service, some of the friendliest I've experienced anywhere in the world. 

I loved the discreet entrance to the hotel (so discreet the taxi driver didn't know of it). A very different experience than any of the normal up market chain hotels (of which I use a lot through work) even upon entering the reception. 
 
A very warm welcome and we had e choice of room key or fingerprint technology for opening the door. While a bit of fun frustratingly my print never seemed to open the door although my wife was able to. 

I wasn't sure about the room at first but after our first night sleeping in the faboulously comfortable bed and using he great shower we were converted again to the minimalist layout (although would have loved a kettle and tea). The free mini bar was good although sadly no alcohol!  Our room overlooked the courtyard which with the large opened windows was a place we sat and caught the sun.

We used the bar on a couple of nights and had a lot of fun with the barman, Thomas who was very attentive and looked to engage with us if we wanted. This is something we found with many of the staff their willingness and ability to interact and engage with us. This was especially true for the wonderful Irena in the restaurant and Xavi  on reception. 

We ate in the restaurant twice as it was so good. Fantastic menu that was simple but with a beautiful combination of flavours. The hotel recommended a range of restaurants for us to visit including Michelin but this was too good to miss. And not expensive ( well not compared to dining in Australia!). 

Really everything about our stay was just great. And again (and it's the business I'm in) the service was first class. Thank you for the experience. I truly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,07,28
40,Fabulous Hotel in Barcelona,"Amazing Hotel in Barcelona. On our way in to we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental and I preferred this hotel over the Mandarin which is not nearly as expensive. The staff are extremely helpful, the rooms are large and nothing is a problem.
The ambience is very cool and sleek and the their most basic room is large with amazing bathroom amenities.
On our last morning we were advised to be downstairs for breakfast at 7am as we had a 7:45am pick up to the airport and breakfast had not started as it is between 7 - 7:30am and the staff in the breakfast area did everything that she could to bring us eggs, fruit and yoghurt to send us on our way fast.
I would definitely stay there again despite the small breakfast mistake.
I would also request a firmer pillow next time as the one provided was very soft.
Highly reccommend.",5,2012,07,23
40,A Fabulous Hotel,"Arriving in Barcelona three days early, I texted my daughter to find us a hotel and she came up with this gem! A lovely, modern sleek facility in a good neighborhood with the best service I may have ever experienced in a hotel. From the bartender to the waitress to the front desk clerks and the doormen, I have never received such fabulous treatment and service. They recommended wonderful restaurants, activities and even helped us to rent a car to drive to the Priorat. They pretty much arranged the entire rental. All I had to do was provide my credit card. It was reasonable and they arranged for us to be driven to the pick up spot. A special shout out to Pau and Vera for their help and friendliness. I loved Barcelona.",5,2012,07,20
40,FABULOUS,"The Alma Barcelona is amazing, we loved the hotel, the service, ambience, and location.   The staff is gracious and knowledgeable.  The rooms are absolutely beautiful along with all the common areas.  We love the Alma Barcelona.  Thank you for making our trip so special.",5,2012,07,19
40,loved it!,Really beautiful 1st class accommodation set in a sleek modern style. upgraded to executive room and totally worth it! small balcony really gave you a feeling of being in center of city. The location was really perfect- quite yet close to everything. The staff was so very helpful friendly and always willing to help. And the BED the BED - we called the magic bed because it was so comfortable we just fell into a deep sleep and woke up so happy rested and refreshed..love this place!!,5,2012,07,19
40,Would stay here again,"Thtis is a very nice hotel, in a great location, right off the Passeig de Gracia.  We stayed in the Executive Suite, very roomy and fairly priced at 305 euro per night. This is a large room, with a large bathroom, the shower is fantastic, 2 tv's, plenty of cable channels, a few english speaking channels.  The bed was big and quite comfortable.  The staff are fantastic, very helpful, and all speak excellent english.  I would definitely stay here again.  Also, the pictures on their website quite accurately depict the rooms, which is a little unusual, so what you see is actually what you get.  I don't think you would need to book the much more expensive suite, as this room is large enough for 2 comfortably.",4,2012,07,19
40,Would be perfect if it had training equipment in their gym,"Just back from 10 days at the hotel Alma. Family of 4 (2 teenagers)
The hotel is simply a world class boutique hotel. Top service, clean, comfortable. Perfectly situated. The only negative is that it does not have training equipment(bicycle, treadmill) just weird elastics and a few weights. Just does not make sense compare to the rest of the hotel",3,2012,07,18
40,Lovely Hotel in a Good Location,"The Alma presents with quietly, understated opulence. The check-in area consists of two desks with a love seat in front. The staff offer you cava or water as you complete the check-in process. You are offered the use of a room key or the new finger-print access technology. The lobby bar/restaurant area are also in muted colors and there is a lovely outdoor dining area as well.The entire hotel seems muted due to the colors, or lack thereof, providing a very calming experience. Our room was a standard room that was quite large. There is a separate room for the toilet which was approximately 35 sq.feet! Nothing else in it. The shower and dual sinks were in another room. There was plenty of shelf space and hangers, robes, etc. There were sliding frames that served as blinds to darken the room which were very effective. The only negative was in the shower area. Basically there are two rain-type shower heads and two hand-helds in an area that has no glass enclosure, only a regulation size bath mat. The water sprays everywhere and consequently the floor is quite slippery and you have to use towels to sop up everything before you risk falling. We found the location to be excellent - just off the Passig Gracia and another block from the Rambla Catalunya. So it is quiet but close to all the shops and great restaurants, cafes, etc. It is about a 15 minute walk to the Sagreda Familia and 10 minutes down to the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas. All in all a great place to stay.",4,2012,07,17
40,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"Don't look any further. This is the best hotel in Barcelona.Great location, great rooms and unbeatable service.We will defenitly return.",5,2012,07,16
40,wonderful design hotel in the heart of the city,"My husband and I stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon. The hotel is beautiful, particularly if you love modern, minimal design. It's just off the Passeig de Gracia, one of the main avenues in Barcelona with lots of shopping and restaurants and just a couple blocks from the Passeig de Gracia metro station which makes it super easy to get to from the airport. The staff is wonderful - they upgraded our room and treated us to a plate of jamon iberico upon our arrival. We only wish we had decided to stay longer to enjoy the spa too!",5,2012,07,16
40,"Great location, comfortable rooms and Brilliant service",This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in terms of service especially from the front desk people. In a way they helped make our family holiday in Barcelona a success. The junior suite was a bit dark but nevertheless very comfortable. The location is ideal too for shopping and eating out. Strongly recommend as it is value for money.,5,2012,07,15
40,"Perfect in every way - Location, accommodations, service","We were so happy we chose Alma for a 3-night stay in Barcelona kicking off our Spain vacation.  First of all, loved the Eixample location right off the Passeig de Gracia - very central, but not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the Gothic Quarter.  This was in direct contrast to our unwitting choice in Madrid - right on the Gran Via - a location I did not like.  Alma is sleek and modern - almost stark, but we were prepared for this based on Tripadvisor reviews.  We arrived from the airport around 3:00 pm, greeted right away with water and cava like the reviews say.  We were told our room would be ready in about 30 minutes so we went to the super cool hotel restaurant to grab a quick bite.  The outdoor terrace is also lovely.  The hotel was like an oasis in the middle of a great, centrally located shopping and strolling area.  While we were eating one of the best and most interesting lunches of our trip (there were so many!) one of the fantastic front desk personnel - Javier - came to tell us our room was ready and that his shift was ending but he would see us tomorrow!  This is indicative of the wonderful service we received from Javier and everyone at the front desk throughout our stay.  When you check in they give you a map and orient you to the city - ask you if you need any help with any reservations or anything.  The room was great - large - great shower stall, comfortable bed.  Yes it's dark like the reviews say- but it stays light until late in Barcelona and the room was bright with the sun.  You want it dark to sleep (the bathroom area was lighter)!  Also the blinds were a wooden shade - slided like a Japanese screen.  So efficient and completely blocked the light.  We had a view of the Gaudi house - La Pedrada from our room!  We never sampled the breakfast, opting for grabbing a quick croissant.  I would describe this as a quiet, romantic hotel in the middle of the city.  All the guests we saw throughout our stay seemed happy and relaxed.  

One thing - the gym isn't really a gym so people should be aware of this.  It has a system I was not familiar with (TRX or something) with pulleys suspended from the roof.  YOu have to know how to use this.  No other equipment - like treadmill or elliptical.  They could use that.  But hey - Barcelona never sleeps - you are walking all over the city till very late.  Every time you turn a corner there's something interesting happening.  Work out when you get home!",5,2012,07,13
40,Great Location!,"The Alma is a boutique hotel with 72 rooms decorated in a modern style.  It is just a few steps off of Passeig de Gracia and a block or so from two of Gaudi's principal buildings in Barcelona.  Excellent restaurants abound in the area and it is not much of a walk to either La Sagrada Familia or to La Rambla.  But what sets this hotel apart is its service.  They take the time to get it right.  Every person we dealt with at the front desk had the same ""How can I help you"" attitude.  It was a pleasure being there for the two nights.",5,2012,07,12
40,Very Good; Minimalist - probably overly,"We spent 2 nights in the Alma. We drive to Barcelona, and despite being on the correct street/block, found it difficult to find the hotel. It was only after about 3 laps of the block we spotted the very small sign at the entrance. The hotel is very well finished, in a clean modern comfortable style. Very quiet. Very good staff, exceptionally helpful. We had a 6th floor room overlooking the courtyard. Lovely comfortable bed. While we spent a lot of time out of the hotel, for the cost for the stay, we would have liked to have had more English channels on the TV, or at very least a selection of movies [the hotel offered only free to air satellite channels]. There were no coffee/tea making facilities in the room; A coffee machine and teapot and kettle would be a good addition [I desperately need a hot cup of something freshly brewed (not instant) in the morning well before I'm even presentable for room service!]. My wife also missed the availability of a full-length mirror, and shower caps. Apart from a hand-held shower, the fixed shower head is an overhead rain-style which cannot be angled to avoid getting the hair wet. While not missed on this trip, there was no bathtub.",4,2012,07,11
40,Excellent  choice.,"Excellent  choice. Beautiful design, elegant, and tasteful.Great staff, very cordial.",5,2012,07,11
40,Excellent Location,"We spent 3 nights at the Alma as the start to our Spanish holiday. The hotel is in a great location and you can walk to many of the famous attractions. It is a trendy boutique hotel but is on a road so the rooms at the front can be noisy. Breakfast was ok - for 25 Euros each it was disappointing.
Rooms are well appointed, soft drinks were free in the mini bar. Breakfast and dinner can be served in the large terrace at the back of the hotel.
We did have a few issues with our room but these were sorted out by Miguel, who was amazing and also provided information on our next location.",4,2012,07,11
40,Comfortable and friendly hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights in July .  It's a very comfortable hotel with a modern design. The room was large and the bed comfortable. We liked that we had a duvet each on a double bed. Although in a busy and prime tourist location our room overlooked the courtyard at the back and was very quiet. Shower was large and modern and shower products were provided.  
All the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful, especially Pau on the front desk who recommended some excellent eating places for us, and looked after us very well.  
Our only criticism would be of the bar staff.  They were rarely at the bar and you normally had to go looking for them to order a drink.  We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel either as even for a five star hotel we thought 25euros each for breakfast was too excessive.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely return again should we be in Barcelona.",4,2012,07,10
40,"A  central , peaceful haven","We stayed for 3 nights in this very nice hotel .Centrally located for the shops & sights. Rooms very nicely appointed in a minimalist style.Strangely no shower caps or flannels provided ,which we thought mean for  a 5  star hotel. However the staff were very friendly & helpful. They helped us book to see all the attractions in advance to avoid the queues & were also excellent in their restaurant suggestions.
Breakfast was also good with efficient service.",5,2012,07,09
40,"Great location, very near perfect","Hotel had a really sleek and modern design and layout, loved the dark interiors. Great location - a 15 minute stroll to La Rambla and tour bus stops a minute away. Finger print entry into rooms meant not having to have to look after keys or swipe cards, great idea! Friendly staff always helped us make dinner/show reservations. Nice, spacious room, although we did find it a very dusty (had it not been for this, the title of this review would have been 'perfect') but otherwise comfortable. Lovely outdoor courtyard to sit and have a drink in. Would happily stay here again!",4,2012,07,09
40,Luxury,"Loved the fingerprint technology to enter your room - who needs keys or swipe cards?
Near some great Antonio Gaudi houses.  Nice stroll to central Barcelona.  Boutique hotel in a quiet location.  Large, well appointed room and modern bathroom.  Staff were extremely helpful and provided good restaurant suggestions.",5,2012,07,09
40,"Amazing place, almost perfect.","We stayed at the hotel for five nights. My husband and I stayed in an executive suite which we would highly recommend paying the extra 50 or so euros for. It was huge, and felt quite luxurious. Our sons stayed in a deluxe double which was also very nice, being at the back of the hotel and therefore very quiet. We had a very nice welcome to the hotel, as the chap on the front desk seemed to know exactly who we were as soon as we walked throughout the door, and the offer of cold water and a glass of Cava was most welcome. Unfortunately, our good mood was dampened by the fact that our tv's wouldn't work due to the rainstorm (!?), and our plans to order room service and watch the European soccer cup final were scuppered. 
Our room was very spacious, with a great bathroom and comfy beds and crisp white linens. We unfortunately didn't manage to stay in the same room for our entire trip, as the electricals kept failing in the room and we were forced to move. They offered us another suite, but on the 1st floor which we were not happy about due to the street noise, so we eventually moved to one on the 3rd floor which was ok except for a slight musty smell. We asked for a key to open the window which was readily provided, and that helped to air the room.
All in all we loved the hotel for it's modern, spare style and the very helpful and pleasant staff. But it would appear that all the high tech features mean that technical failures are more common which can be very disruptive.",4,2012,07,08
40,Wonderful Hotel!,"I recently stayed here with my daughter for 3 nights...I could not have picked a better hotel! Great location, staff very friendly and helpful. Room very sleek...good size, nice view of the courtyard, and very quiet. And the price was very reasonable...would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2012,07,05
40,Great and quiet place,"We all very much liked the place and will come back. For us it is a treat to stay at a hotel where there is no disturbance of traffic or neighbours. Also very nice personnel. Breakfast should be less expensive, we went to a close by café instead",5,2012,07,04
40,Excellent Services,"First rate services; excellent location. All the staffs are very knowledgeable from where to shop and eat to getting tickets for ""hot"" spots. It is definitely worth the extra to stay at the executive suite. I would highly recommended Alma over any other hotels I have stayed before in Barcelona.",5,2012,07,03
40,Enhanced Our Stay in Barcelona,"We just returned from our trip to Spain.  While in Barcelona, we stayed at the Hotel Alma for five nights.  The hotel was recommended to me by someone who contributes to tripadvisor.  We were not disappointed.  We stayed in an Executive Suite which was also recommended, and it was well worth the additional expense.  We prefer a firm mattress and the bed was the best we've had anywhere we've traveled.  The bathroom was very modern and spacious and the walk in shower had a fantastic rain shower head.  Wi-fi was free (our U.S. hotels should adopt that courtesy).  The refrigerator was stocked daily free of charge with two types of juice, water (still and sparkling) and cokes.  You could not ask for a better location just off the Passeig de Gracia (like Fifth Avenue in NYC).  And - the Concierge staff was unbeatable.  Many thanks to Miquel, Angeles, Xavi, Norman and Nuria for their friendly, warm and helpful attitudes.  Each of them rendered impeccable service.  We arrived strangers and left friends.  I truly feel certain anyone who stays there will feel the same.  When we booked Hotel Alma several months ago, it wasn't rated the Number One hotel in Barcelona, but now it is, and it richly deserves that honor!",5,2012,06,29
40,So close,"I cancelled the Pullman Skipper for Alma and stayed in 2 executive suites with my husband and 2 young children and a teenager.   

The website photos don't use clever camera techniques to improve aesthetics.  Everything is faithfully represented; the epitome of understated, no-nonsense neat, sprawling and, almost, masculine charm.  Not quite what springs to mind for accommodating a family of five including three fairly girly (or was that giddy?) daughters.  But Alma overcame all my stereotypes and ticked all the boxes for a good family luxury hotel at an unbelievably affordable price. There are niggles but almost all is forgiven because the staff are simply great at what they do;  hospitality.

Check-in:  Slow but pleasant.  Staff are attentive, informative and polite without being intrusive.  But with young children and a cool finger scanning machine (rooms are keyless and use finger print recognition for entry), check in took longer than I suspect is normal.  

First niggle:  We found our room alone.  I want to dump our bags and explore asap so I like to have things (no matter how obvious) explained to me and someone to answer questions, e.g. We had 2 separate executive suites separated from the public corridor by a door making them self contained.  We couldn't open this corridor door so called reception for help who explained how to do it (scan your finger as normal, instead of turning the handle to open the door, you have to give it a sharp pull towards you and then a quick push/ shove away from you and it opens.  Now, WHO would have guessed that?).   
 
Rooms:  Rooms are spacious, thoughtfully laid out and comfortable.  Big beds, pillow menu,  huge shuttered windows, quality toiletries (Bulgari), drinks galore (free and non-alcoholic, a lovely touch of hospitability).  No tea or coffee making facilities but we breakfasted early and I was served coffee promptly.   Speaking of breakfast, it IS expensive at 25Euro per person but served by wonderful staff and offers hot and cold breakfasts. The children loved their freshly cooked scrambled eggs and cheesy omelettes.  There were masses of choice of drinks from Champagne and Cava on ice to ""healthy gut"" drinks (whatever they're called) and various fresh juices.  

There is no main light in the rooms but lots of strategically placed lamps and reading lights which was fine for me (good mirrors and lights in the bathroom).  My husband preferred a main light but read and worked on his laptop without any difficulties.   The separate bathroom was great.  Big enclosed rain shower, deep baths, twin sinks, loads of towels and separate toilet and bidet.   Children be careful on the floor.  I have a four year old who runs everywhere, never walks, and she slipped twice on the polished marble bathroom floor.    Wet bathroom floors are always a perpetually-running-child hazard, even at home, so I do not attribute this as a criticism of Alma. Housekeeping did a great job several times daily and left chocolates and water every night.  Free Wi-Fi in the room and good air con.  There was street noise but my husband is a light sleeper and it didn't bother him at all.

Facilities: The kids loved the infinity pool.  It was not deep so they felt brave and my husband swam laps.  I enjoyed the steam room but was too chicken for the dry heat room (HOT!!!). The gym was a sparse with only a Pilates belt, bench press and weights. LOADS of towels and refreshments and everywhere was clean!!

Location: I loved the fact that Alma wasn't showy and pretentious looking.  Just around the corner you have flashy hotels with gigantic flamboyant signs looking pompous next to equally ostentatious looking designer shops which is fine, I love shopping and love staying in flashy hotels.  But I appreciated the understated and quiet reserve of the Alma.  It was refreshing.  The children walked everywhere.  Very rarely did we need to take taxis anywhere because almost everything was within walking distance and so much to see on the way. The hotel staff always booked special taxis to fit all 5 of us if we ever needed it (they would book everything for us from dinner reservations to activities).

Why did I dock a point? I love ""Watching the English"" by Kate Fox because I recognise so much of myself and people I know in it.  I went to check out with tonnes of luggage and children in tow half an hour before my car was due to give me enough time to settle and get to the airport (Alma actually booked my car and explained to the driver I wanted to be early).  Reception was full and we were told to wait in the lobby until they were free.  After 20 mins of waiting most patiently 2 people walked past with luggage.   After 21 mins I sent my husband to investigate again.  Unbelievably, they had just begun to check out the 2 people who walked past us with luggage and when my husband questioned it, they asked ""We're sorry, we have started checking them out now so can we just finish it?  We'll be as quick as we can"".   We finally got to our car just after half past, 50 minutes after getting to reception (with young children), our driver had waited for 25 mins (he arrived 5 mins early) and paying nearly choked me because they had made me wait nearly an hour for that privilege.  I hate queue jumping and tardiness ...",4,2012,06,29
40,In love with Alma,"I recently stayed five nights at The Alma hotel Barcelona and wasn't dissapointed. The hotel and the overall space were lovely and an oasis from shopping and sightseeing in the June heat of the city. Our room was simple and well finished, best of all it was big, with a large bathroom and separate toilet (something I can't recall seeing in a hotel in a long time). 

As all the other reviews about The Alma say, 'the staff are lovely', and I can only concur. All were charming and incredibly helpful. If in Barcelona again I would stay again. I now want to see where their other hotels are and perhaps plan my next trip around them.

The Alma deserves to be a success, which I hope it will be.",4,2012,06,28
40,excellent,"1. Very stylish hotel and modern rooms and lobby
2. Very friendly staff at the reception
3. Extremely comfortable bed and soft linen

The negative side is that the room is very dark at night. Not enough lights in the room or in the lift. They were also late in cleaning our room (they did it around lunch time though we had left it since the morning)",5,2012,06,27
40,My new go-to hotel in Barcelona,"It feels like a boutique hotel, but the rooms are enormous.  The service was superb, and the location ideal with Gaudi's La Pedrera literally right around the corner.  If you'd like an upscale hotel in Barcelona, this will do nicely.",5,2012,06,27
40,Amazing Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"Where do I start? located near the Paseig  de Gracia which is one of the greatest avenues in Barcelona, very central, the Alma Hotel lived up to every expectations I had from reading the previous reviews on Trip Advisor and other sites.  The best way to describe the property is a "" design boutique hotel with a flair"".   Beautiful architecture, very original lobby layout, amazing outdoor patio/restaurant/garden for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks... very spacious rooms that use fingerprint as key (liberating from the lost key syndrome!!), ingenious wood panels that replace typical curtains and block the light in the room, minimalist furniture yet inviting and comfortable, free soft drink and water bar, amazing bathroom with large shower and above all, outstanding service from the young beautiful team at the front desk, concierge, and the staff that served us breakfast every day... Did I mention that prices were very affordable for this kind of five star luxury? .. We spend 4 memorable night and did not want to leave.  We will definitely make this hotel our destination of choice in Barcelona going forward.",5,2012,06,26
40,Great hotel and a perfect location,"We stayed at the ALMA for 3 nights and it was definitely one of our most enjoyable stays at a hotel ever. The hotel is beautifully decorated, the rooms are huge and very clean. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and the location is just perfect for travelers who like to be close to the center, but in a quiet enough area at the same time. All the main attractions are reachable by foot, or by a short taxi ride. Tons of great restaurants in the area, don't miss Cerveseria Catalana, which is on the same street as the hotel, and is an incredible tapas place. All in all it's been a perfect experience from start to end and we will definitely go back to this wonderful hotel.",5,2012,06,26
40,a gem that shouldn't be missed in its class,"we stayed at the grand deluxe room facing inner courtyard. 

the hotel actually deserves a 5 star, unfortunately there was no air conditioning on the first night and it was suffocatingly hot and the hotel wasn't able to do anything until the following morning.  we tossed and turned, wasn't able to sleep. it was a spoiler. 

location cant be beat. apart from the AC issue, the hotel's Internet photos did not do them justice, the entire hotel has an understated elegance, from their subtle entrance to the fine details in the room.  my partner is an architect, so she immediately spotted all the nice features like concealed ventilation and floating wood feature wall in the toilet enclosure, entire piece of marble in the shower cubicle floor with concealed drain, rice paper shade screen panels at the window etc to name a few. considering all the thoughts they have put in for the design of the room, it was unfortunate that the lighting was not as well thought through. lighting was adequate but without an ambience, especially in the bathroom and the entrance hall. it was either off or really bright. 

the welcoming aqua and cava is a nice touch. the sophisticated fingerprint entry is just so cool. complimentary in room mini bar (all drinks), are being replenished every day.   the bed is the best hotel bed we've ever slept, looks soft but actually comfortably firm, the duvet is very fluffy and light, sheets are velvety soft.  a lovely cosy garden terrace to relax at the end of the day.  hotel also have:  sauna, gym (no treadmill or elliptical machine tho) and an indoor lap pool (narrow but much longer than I expect as I thought it was a tiny one from other TA's comments). staff was helpful, courteous and knowledgeable. good English too. 

all in all, we had a superb stay except for the first night without AC. ",4,2012,06,25
40,5 night stay,Refined luxury without pretense. Front desk is well informed and can provide good recs on non-touristic food options as well as help in navigating the city.,5,2012,06,24
40,Totally overrated with awful service; spend the extra €30 to stay at the mandarin,"Awful experiemce...the price is way too high for what u get. Rooms are decent but thats it. Service is awful. They were rude, gave wrong addresses for restaurants they recommended, one was even closed, doorman never once opened door, notneven when i arrived with luggage. And the worst part was since there was no seperate concierge when it was check in or check out time forget abt asking a question....i even had to wait 15 min to get my own key. I dont know  if the good reviews come from ppl who paid under €200a nite, arent well travelled, or had dofferent staff, but i feel ripped off amd wish i would have spent €430 for the mandarin vs €400 for this. Oh and the spa is a joke. Amd no room service either.",1,2012,06,24
40,Very Good. Recommended.,"New hotel, Modernly designed spacy rooms. Staff if extremely helpful, friendly and very service oriented. Beautiful internal terrace garden Central Barcelona location - inside hotel is an oasis-  nice calm and quiet, step out of the door and traffic can be rather hectic. Distance 3km from the beach.",5,2012,06,23
40,"Welcoming, comfortable, peaceful, stylish and efficient","We were welcomed by a helpful and informative receptionist who listened to what we wanted from our trip and gave us useful suggestions, travel, food and booking info all accompanied by a glass of cava. The hotel was beautifully minimal but luxuriously comfortable, clean and peaceful. The hotel directory was absent and there were a couple of minor repairs that really should have been done (both due to bathroom or pool water damage) but those are the only minor items I saw to mar a super stay.",5,2012,06,22
40,Excellent boutique hotel,"A wonderful hotel to stay in when in Barcelona.  The location is excellent, the staff is friendly and professional, the room was large and clean.  Lovely garden area for a city hotel.  Quiet upscale neighborhood and walking distance to many of Barcelona's architectural wonders.  If I were to return to Barcelona, I would definitely go back to the Alma Barcelona.",5,2012,06,20
40,Fantastic,"My husband booked this hotel after trying to get a lovely hotel in Barcelona. Well it has turned out to be fantastic.
We arrived on Monday lunchtime 18th June and walked into reception to be meet by 2 members of staff who couldn't do enough forvus from a glass of Cava to an upgrade room. We have meet only members of staff who only want to make your stay the best.
The rooms are lovely and airy,the rain showers are brilliant.
All I can say is please stay in this hotel it is everything you want when you go away for a break in a city.
It is situated in a great location very quite and very trendy.
Enjoy your stay just like we have.",5,2012,06,20
40,Quiet and comfortable boutique hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the hotel for a long weekend in June. The location is perfect for exploring the city while still far enough from Las Ramblas to avoid the worst tourist masses. We stayed in a Grand Deluxe room and were overall very happy with the room and the amenities (the free soft drink minibar was a nice touch).

We had breakfast in the restaurant and the quality was consistent with the rest of the experience, so no complaints - lovely local charcuterie and fresh fruits to get your day started.

The two things that keep me from giving a five-star review are 1) our bed which did not have a single queen/king mattress, but rather two separate ones (meaning that I kept slipping in the gap), and 2) as our room was on the first floor, there was some noise from the terrace (nothing severe though).",4,2012,06,18
40,Nice Hotel,"We booked an executive suite and it was great, one of the most comfortable beds ever and great bathroom as well.  Beautiful hotel in a really great location, we visited the restaurant once and although nice not great.

Bar is nice and very chilled out but almost too chilled out, lacked atmosphere and quiet often no staff behind it at all.

Spa is not really a spa as such just a shallow dipping pool and sauna and steam room, my husband loved it and was the only person using it most evenings but some may be disappointed.

Over a great hotel in a lovely city!",4,2012,06,17
40,"Dark rooms, nice people","The personnel at Alma Barcelona are extraordinarily helpful, patient and pleasant. The location is excellent and all the attractions of the city are easily accessible. The rooms need more lighting, it was difficult to see in the room at night with the current lighting.",5,2012,06,17
40,"Trendy, but also functional and comfortable","Well located, about a 10 minute walk north of Las Ramblas, 20 minutes west of La Sagrada Familia and a few minutes away from La Pedrera. There are many great restaurants in the vicinity, as well as shops.

We stayed in an Executive Suite and were very happy with the room. The rainfall shower was fantastic and the room was very large and comfortable. The decor was minimalistic with clean lines, solid colours and a bit cold, but not enough to detract from our stay. The novelty of the fingerprint scanner did not wear out. It was very quiet at night.

The service was impeccable, especially with regard to taking care of our restaurant reservations.

Only one suggestion - please consider equipping your rooms with DVD players!",5,2012,06,14
40,"Will return, terrific stay!","We just returned from 2 nights at the Alma Barcelona on a week long trip to Spain. The Alma was the highlight of our trip hotel wise. The location is perfect - walking distance from many terrific restaurants, nestled among beautiful city blocks and very close to several Gaudi buildings. Only a 15 min walk to La Rambla & the waterfront, but out of the main tourist zone so quieter tourist wise, and in my opinion, a much nicer neighborhood. The hotel is near many high end shops if you are interested in good shopping.

The staff was extremely helpful and made us feel right at home. The rooms were very spacious and bathrooms large and brand new. Hotel has only been open a year. Decor is modern and understated but well appointed. The bar is fun and outdoor back terrace nice for a mojito after a day of sightseeing.

We will return!",5,2012,06,12
40,"Excellent staff, service","The staff gave us such personalized service that I knew most of their names at the end of our 7 night stay. 

We called the night before to let them know we'd be arriving very early the next day, and they indicated they will likely have our room available. Not only was it available but they seemed to know which couple they were expecting that morning. We were greeted with offer of a seat, a quick chat on our particulars (welcome water was offered), finger print for the door, directions to our room with our bags delivered right away and we slept for the next 5 hours high-quality sheets with comfortable, separate quilts on a gigantic bed. The shutters darkened the room and noise and we slept beautifully every night regardless of the time of day/night or weather.

I have another 46 paragraphs on the topic but in the interest of all, I will leave it at that. It was all good, no recommendations for improvement in any way. 

Just this-breakfast is 25 Euro! Do it once since the garden is lovely, but there are many fine cafes nearby that are just as good and are a part of the city so suggesting you take advantage of those instead. Also, the staff of their breakfast/dinner garden aren't nearly as good as the rest of the staff. 

One more thing! Internet access there is excellent. We used the garden a lot for chilling for a couple of hours before our next outing, and the internet service in our room and the garden were excellent. In the rest of Barcelona, not so much. We didn't feel compelled to order anything when out there since they have several small tables further away from those who were eating. Maybe it was just because we were down there so late each day since we slept so well.",5,2012,06,11
40,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"Perfect location, really high level, service oriented staff. They are solving your wishes with emphaty and immediatley. We will come back for sure.",5,2012,06,11
40,Wonderful!,"Located just 30 seconds from Passeig de Gracia, which is the ""Fifth Avenue"" of Barcelona, this newish hotel is wonderful!  Dark, sleek, and minimalist, with a large outdoor courtyard and nice onsite restaurant, it speaks volumes by underplaying it's role as an important, well-located Barcelona hotel.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Make sure you carry a map of the hotel and immediate area as many cab drivers don't know the hotel by name, and yet it is located so central to everything and anything you could need.  Room was large and sleek with 12 foot ceilings.  Open concept (no door) vanity sink and walk in rainforest head-equipped shower area (the shower itself is built for two with two shower heads at each end and a massive 8 feet by 4 feet in size) but could provide privacy issues for some unrelated guests sharing a room.  Don't fret, at least the toilet is in a separate room with a door.  Finger print used to open room door very ""James Bond"".  Would stay again without hesitation!  Run don't walk to Alma!",5,2012,06,09
40,Unbelievable service,"I dont even know where to begin. The hotel is located in the heart of the Eixample district so it is within walking distance of many attractions. Upon arrival (early) we were immediately given a room even thought it was only 9am. The reservation people were very cordial and when I inquired about a converter for my CPAP I was told that they didnt have one but would immediately go out and purchase one for my use. Are you kidding me? What hotel does that? The cost of the 220v to 110v converter must have been as much as a one night stay. They simply said they would keep it for future use for their American friends. The restaurant at the hotel was quite good-one funny side note. My wife ordered her appetizer and entree' and the waiter walked away! When he came with the wine, I asked if he would like to take my order now. He didnt speak much english but he thought my wife had ordered for both of us. Restaurant recommendations were excellent and we loved the minimalist nature of the hotel.",5,2012,06,08
40,"Great hotel, great location, highly recommended for couples","Fantastic hotel,  negatives all minor I.e. no full length mirror in the room.",5,2012,06,07
40,Amazing Hotel and Staff,"My wife and I stayed at the Alma Hotel for a vacation towards the end of May.  The hotel staff was so personable and helpful.  The rooms were modern, clean and quiet and we had a good view of the top of a Gaudi building too.   All of their suggestions for restaurants and attractions were spot on.  Not having been to Barcelona before we felt immediately welcomed and knew where to go.  We kept trying to get reservations at a fancy restaurant but they shared another suggestion that turned out even better.

The only concern we had was that the hotel breakfast was vey expensive (25euros) and it was the same breakfast we received included at another hotel.  We felt it wasn't worth the expense.  But, that was the only hitch.  Everything else was superb.",5,2012,06,07
40,Would definitely go back,"Just returned from a long weekend in barcelona staying at the Alma.
Firstly the location is excellent,you are literally 30 seconds walk from the Passeig de Gracia,about a minutes walk from your first slice of Gaudi architecture-La Pedera and 5 mins from your second-Casa Batlló.
The hotel itself is very stylish-minimalist yet comfortable without ever being pretentious.In fact the staff are amongst the friendliest, nicest people I have ever come across.
You are made to feel very much at home as soon as you arrive and I have to say I loved the fingerprint entry system for your room and the Spa-you get to feel like a secret agent every time you open your door!!!
Our room was immaculately clean,all dark wood and pristine white ceramics with an extremely comfortable Kingsize bed with separate duvets so no duvet stealing from the significant other!!!
The terraced garden at the rear of the hotel is lovely and also very quiet-perfect for late afternoon tea after sightseeing.
The Spa has a steam room,sauna,a very funky if small pool and a fitness room.I would say that the fitness room,being a bit of a gym freak,was my only disappointment just for lack of equipment-it has 1 bench ,a trx and a pilates machine with only 2 free weights but I was happy to swim more.
We only ate breakfast at the restaurant which was very good but a touch on the pricey side (25 euros each) unless you have a mammoth appetite and can put away a whole buffet!!
There were a good selection of cold meats,pastries,fruit,yoghurts and cereals to help yourself to while any extras such as scrambled eggs can be ordered from the kitchen
This was my first time visiting Barcelona and I would love to return soon.
When I do I won't hesitate to stay at the Alma again.:-)",5,2012,06,06
40,Minimalistic excellence,"Minimalistic modern almost nordic in its expression. Staff +++ service minded, rooms superb, location is excellent.",5,2012,06,05
40,Uber cool i,"Loved the understated cool of the Alma. Not for those who love stripes or chintz or flounces. Staff are well trained, very friendly and call you by your name - rare in many hotels. Garden is a haven of peace. Lots of newspapers every day to browse through. Free wifi. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Silent air con. Only niggle - we booked an executive suite which was beautiful but very noisy at night from traffic - all the exec suites we were told are on the road side so no point changing to another and ear plugs dont block the noise. We would stay again but would sacrifice space and take a smaller room for a quiet night's sleep.",4,2012,06,03
40,Definitly recommend to stay at Alma Hotel,"We just back from Barcelona and were staying at Alma Hotel, first of all I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is modern, authentic and stylish hotel, very quiet, very close to one of greatest streets for shopping. We were pleased by service level, personal approach, reception managers were helping for anything from get an advice and reserve a table at restaurant till find out place to rent a bike. Rooms are very clean, with cleaning service few times a day. I would recommend to have a dinner/lunch for sure and breakfasts was one of the best we had. On last day we even back, after check out, to have desert at the hotel.",5,2012,06,03
40,Amazing boutique hotel,"This is our second trip to Barcelona.  Last year we stayed at the Murmuri, which is just around the corner from the Alma and is also a lovely boutique hotel.  We were tempted to stay there again, but decided to try out the Alma due to all the great reviews on tripadvisor.  We are so happy with our decision.  The room is spotless and simple: wood floors, firm, but very comfortable king bed (not two twins pushed together), separate duvets for each person, rainshower, double-paned windows, flat-screen etc...  The hotel is no-frills which some people may not like.  There are no paintings on the walls, no coffee maker in the room, no all-day room service (just breakfast and dinner), BUT the Alma makes up for all that with it's service.  Every single person we have encountered at the hotel has been beyond helpful and happy.  The staff at the Murmuri were always disorganized and overwhelmed and often gave out incorrect information like telling us the Sagrada Familia was closed when in fact it was open. 

Our deluxe room at the Alma faced the back of the hotel and overlooked the large courtyard as well as the backs of other buildings.  The double-paned windows kept all the noise out and the room was very quiet.  The only time we heard noise was in the late morning/early afternoon when housekeeping was cleaning the floors above us.  The air-con is controlled in the room and very accurate.  Note: for those who need a lot of privacy in the bathroom, the shower and sink area is separated from the bedroom by a wooden screen.  There is no door on the shower, so you may feel like you're out in the open.  The toilet is separate in an enclosed and very private corner, which is nice.

I would definitely recommend the Alma to anyone visiting Barcelona.  The location can't be beat (a block from the passeig de gracia which is lined with high-end shops and restaurants, 2 blocks from the quiet end of the rambla de catalunya which leads you to the busy end a pleasant 20 minute walk away).  Book it!",5,2012,06,03
40,Alma is excellent,"My husband and I went to Barcelona for a romantic anniversary trip. Alma was really fantastic. The staff were friendly and accommodating (and never minded speaking to us in English).

The good:
- The beds were huge and the mattress was comfortable and supportive (if a tiny bit hard)
- Incredibly quiet hotel, there is a distinct feeling of privacy that is luxurious (we were facing the courtyard and it was so quiet!)
- Wood shutters provide total darkness for better sleep quality
- The wifi is free
- They provide a small variety of free beverages in rooms (very nice to have free water available!)
- The spa/gym, though very small, is very nice to have available (they have both dry and steam saunas)
- Incredible location if you like luxurious shopping (think Gucci); right near La Pedrera
- Friendly, helpful staff (who offered us coffee/champagne on arrival)

The not as good:
- The showers don't have doors. I know this is very European, but also very annoying! Wood floors get wet
- The decor was minimal to the point of feeling sparse. It was kinda neat but not very warm and inviting. A bit cold for a place you want to come to at the end of the day to relax and settle in to
- The breakfast, though delicious with a huge variety of choices, is 25 Euro - very expensive in my book
- Slightly far from common tourist areas like La Rambla, but not unwalkable

But all in all, really fantastic. If I ever go back to Barcelona I can't imagine wanting to stay anywhere else.",5,2012,05,31
40,Impressive Designer Hotel in central location,"First off, I should say this is one of those dark designer hotels where everything is dark, shiny, or square or all of the above.  Stayed only one night but very impressed.  Small little sign at the front which took awhile for the taxi to find.  There is no traditional reception desk, just a long table on the right as you walk in, which more looks like the concierge desk but is kind of both.  Very large lobby with couches and place to relax with large atrium for drinks, relaxing or dinner.  Location is great off Passeig de Gracia halfway between Av Diaganol and the large square where La Rambla meets the Passeig (where all the tourist buses start from).  

Rooms are large and well designed.  Great bed with comfortable and warm duvet.  Lots of closet space.  Minibar included free nonalcholic drinks which was amazing - i can't say I have ever seen that before.  Separate toilet.  Large walk in marble floor/glass shower.  Wood floors.  

The most impressive thing was the fingerprint scan room key.  No room key needed, just scan your finger to get into your room.  Never seen that before but very cool.   

I used the sauna which was quite hot and good - very small and shallow lap pool but does the job if you want to do a few laps but you wouldn't spend a lot of time there.  Steam room also.

I would totally return here on a trip to Barcelona.  Don't expect a bustling hotel - its' six stories with maybe 60-70 rooms total, but an oasis and a great vibe after a tiring day touring the city.",5,2012,05,31
40,"Gorgeous, tranquil haven of good taste and wonderful service.","Stayed here for two nights last weekend in May and it was just perfect. From the comfort of check in, (with long leather couches to sit on as the staff deal with you, instead of making you stand), to the innovative fingerprint door entry, and the minimalistic, simple beauty of the rooms, this is a gem of a hotel. 
There's a quiet elegant and pretty courtyard garden at the back,which is heavenly, and the staff are ridiculously kind, attentive, and dare I say, beautifully dressed and good looking. (sorry if that's lookist..but it is Barcelona)
Breakfast was delicious, if pricey, and the drinks at the bar are beautifully presented. Didn't have dinner here, but had a salad and bread in the garden at lunch which was great. There are scores of great restaurants within walking distance.
Our spacious room was at the back, overlooking the courtyard, and so the sleep quality was first class. It could have been in the country it was so peaceful.
Nice little pool and spa in the basement, albeit a bit small. But also beautiful and stylish.
Friendly and helpful reception staff went out of their way to get us tickets for the right time for the Sagrada Familia, and they were beyond charming.
Amazing fun weekend with crazy, drunken fiestas happening all over in in Barcelonetta, so to return to the peace and beauty of the Alma was just wonderful. It is a pricey hotel but the service and atmosphere make it worth every penny.
Can't fault a thing and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else on return to Barcelona.",5,2012,05,31
40,"Peaceful stay, wonderful experience.","What else can we say after reading the other comments? They are all expressing how wonderful this hotel is. We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed being a guest! After visiting and enjoying Barcelona, it was a real treat to come back, enjoy the pool, hammam and sauna and just relax before dinner. Bed is SO confortable and with a choice of different pilows. 
Staff is friendly, taking care of you without being invasive. very delicate. All details are looked after. Will go back to an Alma hotels; loved it!",5,2012,05,30
40,Best hotel stay of my life,"One more night at the Alma but I already know this has been if not the best hotel I've ever stayed at in my life. Mind you though design wise it may not be for everyone but if you are like me who enjoy this aesthetic and also someone who is keen on the details then let me tell you this is the hotel to book. Currently staying at room 113 facing the street but noise is not at all distracting, booked an executive suite, square footage is amazing, ample space for everything. Love the chevron wood flooring juxtaposed with the somewhat antiquated midnight blue walls. Comfortable bed, might me a foam mattress, two duvets available, softest down pillows. Bulgari toiletries - need I say more?

Service is what makes this hotel top notch. Cava upon check in, not your typical check in mind you. You get greeted personally with a handshake , seated At a nice sofa, drinks on hand, our front desk agent ( I forgot his name I feel so bad) was very welcoming offered to help with anything we need. The staff was warm but very professional, super personalized.  We booked tickets for Sagrada Familia and they offered to print them for us!!  They are even so joyful when they pick up the phone ( its all in the small details). 

Breakfast was great but on the high end side. But you are on vacation so live it up!

Location: safe, chic upscale part of Barna. Near shops and all the Gaudi that you want the experience.

Pool is adequate but could use a few more dumbells.

All in all I would def stay here again. Everything has been so perfect that I could over look the hotel not having an iron available :) wink

Thanks alma!! One more night and looking forward to the next one already.",5,2012,05,30
40,Offers more than the luxury hotels at a reasonable price,"Alma Barcelona provides an Ideal location in Barcelona: an easy walk to many of the best Gaudi architectural sites, and Las Ramblas. Yet it is in a quiet neighborhood with excellent restaurants and shopping within steps. Every street in this neighborhood has beautiful buildings and enticintg shops to admire.
We were delighted with the amenities offered free to us that our friends did not have at the luxury hotel they had chosen. These include wi-fi and reasonable telephone charges. My favorites were the garden and the spa with a warm water lap pool, sauna and steam room. It was perfect for relaxing at the end of a busy day. The hotel was busy yet there was no noise from the street or other guests.  
I cannot thank the staff at this hotel enough for their outstanding service.",5,2012,05,29
40,Paying attention to detail!,"We stayed at the Alma at the tail end of a Mediterranean cruise. What a great hotel, starting with the reception desk. Every person who worked there went out of our way to make us feel welcome. The culture of this small chain shows in the detail, friendliness and overall can-do attitude. And wait until you try the breakfast! The chic style and modern decor were a refreshing change from a typical hotel. We can’t wait to return to Barcelona one day and stay at the Alma again.",5,2012,05,28
40,super hotel,"Stayed at the Alma for 3 nights in may 2012. super hotel. super staff. super service. super location. must mention  Ms. Nuria and add a special thanks to her for making our stay special. restaurants were suggested and booked each night as we are vegetarians travelling with 2 kids. small details like chocolates with the turn down service and the next day's weather on the nightstand really mattered. didn't really eat in but the sangria was the best we sampled in Spain and so was the hot chocolate!!
Two small details- a tea/coffee tray would have been appreciated also if the rooms had an option of brighter lights!
no downside to this hotel at all.",5,2012,05,27
40,Superb,"Stayed here one night before heading out on a cruise.  When we were looking for a hotel in Barcelona, we wanted one with a central location, superb standards but not an over the top price.  Alma was the perfect fit.
Getting off an overnight flight we found our room immediately available.  Once we were ready to explore Barcelona, the staff was more than accommodating to help out.  Las Ramblas is right at your doorstep.
It is a very sleek, modern hotel with very comfortable beds.  Free wi-fi.

Would stay here again.  Highly recommend the Alma Barcelona.",5,2012,05,27
40,"Huge Rooms, Outstanding Staff, Great Location","Got back from a 5 night stay at this lovely property--felt more like a private residence at the Ritz Carlton than a hotel. Rooms were very large,and the impeccable service can't be beat (front desk was always receptive to my requests and came up with excellent recommendations--especially Cerveseria Catalana). WiFi worked very well without any problems (I read this is not always the case with other hotels). Great location within walking distance to almost all the major attractions and most parts of the city. Would be nice if they could have more of a gym on the premises (there is an option to pay to workout at a local gym that is very nice, but at 30 Euro for a single visit that is a steep price). Did not have breakfast in the hotel but there were many of options nearby. Very safe part of town and located on a very quiet street. Would definitely stay here again when I return to BCN.",5,2012,05,26
40,"Most comfortable beds and supper clean rooms, staff are very helpful","Rooms- amazingly big, with lots of storage space, windows open on to court yard like a balcony. 
Bathrooms - huge bath, walk in shower with rain or hand held option, marble, twin basins. 
Free wifi, room safe will fit an iPad in, fridge in room has bottles of complimentary water and soft drinks, but no kettle or tea & coffee facilities which is a let down for the standard of hotel. 
Beds- Extremely comfortable memory foam, high quality crisp bed linen, seperate duvets on doubles, soft pillows. Towels and robes of high standard.
Finger print entry is great no loosing keys. Staff are extremely polite and helpful. Location could not be better, the rooms are really quiet and offer excellent sleeping conditions. ",4,2012,05,25
40,Far Exceeded Expectations,"Service - Went well above and beyond what was necessary. All staff members went out of their way to help with restaurant suggestions and reservations, as well as how to navigate the city. 

Room - Very spacious (even by US standards), clean, comfortable, and bright. As an added bonus you can unlock your door using a fingerprint scanner rather than fumbling around for a key. This is optional for any of your conspriracy theorists. 

Location - Excellent. It's in the swanky part of town, about a 15-20 minute walk to the historic district, or a quick cab ride. There are tons of great shops and restaurants within a few blocks.

Overall - We absolutely loved this place, and Barcelona in general. Highly recommended.",5,2012,05,22
40,Love this place!,"I can't say enough good about Alma Barcelona.  The location is absolutely perfect -- in the Eixample, so not quite as loud/touristy, but a short walk to the premier Gaudi sites.  We were a block and a half from Casa Mila (with a view of the roof from our room), 2.5 blocks from Casa Batllo and a pleasant 10 min walk to Sagrada Familia.  Starbuck's and restaurants nearby and very convenient to the metro as well.  Our room was large, modern and very well appointed.   The bed was deliriously comfortable.  And the staff was absolutely amazing and helpful.  We also loved the keyless entry (you can use a fingerprint reader to enter your room).   I highly recommend this hotel and would absolutely stay here again!",5,2012,05,18

40,excellent hotel,"We visited Barcelona several times the past few years but it was our first stay in Hotel Alma. Only one word can describe our experience: excellent. The rooms are very spacious and exquisitely designed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Although this is a more high-end hotel you immediately feel right at home. The breakfast buffet can be quietly enjoyed in a relaxing sofa or, when the weather permits, in the beautiful garden. For distracted people, don’t worry anymore about where you left your room key. You can just open the door using the fingerprint scanner. The hotel is located at the corner of the Passeig de Gràcia, a very central and more luxurious area of the city. Without any doubt one of the best hotels in Barcelona. The next time we go to Barcelona we will definitely stay at the Alma hotel again.",5,2012,05,15

40,Absolute Class and Staff to match,"Just back from a long weekend stay in Alma,as some of your previous reviewers state it is an island of calm in bustling Barcelona on grand prix weekend!
From the moment I arrived from a golfing week in cambrils and checked in  early to arrange flowers for my partners birthday who was flying in from Newcastle later that day,the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful,a different class to the staff in Arts where I stayed on my last visit to the city
When Marie my partner joined me later she was met with a glass of cava and birthday wishes
Paul,one of the most professional and friendly front desk guys I have met arranged a restaurant for us for  that night and tipped them off that it was her birthday
A great touch when they brought a cake out totally unbeknown to me
When we arrived back to our room that night a bottle of cava was on ice for us in our room

Now that is very special service AND the reason why I will be staying at Alma on my next visit to this great city

We were on the 6th floor with views over the oasis of a garden and given how busy the city is we could not hear any noise at all

I can't comment on the food as we ate out all of the time but the breakfast option looked comprehensive if continental is your thing

The whole operation is first class with first class friendly staff making time every day for a chat

Don't hesitate......get it booked",5,2012,05,14

40,Great Location,"This is quite a luxurious hotel as you would expect from an Alma Hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Rooms are somewhat unusual but very spacious, well appointed with a very large bathroom. I missed a  coffee maker which I often find useful (I don't mind paying good money for a full breakfast buffet but I still have a problem paying that for a continental breakfast). Parking is conveniently available nearby. 

The outstanding feature of this hotel is its location on Mallorca just steps from Paseig de Las Gracias. Several major attractions are within easy walking distance, i.e. Plaza Catalunya, Las Ramblas, Barri Gotic, Sagrada Familia, to name a few.  We don't mind walking so we even walked to Park Guell. Stops for hop-on/off tourist buses are just around the corner on Paseig de Las Gracias.  A very good experience overall.",4,2012,05,10

Modern design with fingerprint room-access and large tub / separate shower made our 2 night stay very relaxing. We chose this hotel over the Hotel d'Arts and are very happy with this choice. However, if you're looking to be by the beach or out of the 'bustle' of the city, try the Pullman Skipper. Our only complaint here is with service which was rather slow and inattentive. In the outdoor lounge we waited forever for a menu, for our drinks, and for the check. This is in stark comparison to the service we've received at most restaurants and other hotel bars. My wife was upset we didn't get the complimentary champagne (or perhaps cava) upon check-in, though we saw other couples served. In all, very nice (it's all about the design, room layout) but wouldn't stay again (simply because unless it's a knock-out, we like to try new places). Fairly good value as we got a discount upgrade through one of the booking sites.",4,2012,05,08
40,Fantastic stay,"I spent a week at the Alma Barcelona, first on my own for business, and then was joined by my family. This is a truly great hotel. The front desk staff were warm and incredibly friendly and helpful in every way. The location is ideal; I walked or rode the Metro everywhere I needed to go. The breakfast was pricey but very elegant and had local flair. The keyless entry to the rooms (fingerprint) was remarkably helpful - I hadn't ever really thought about it, but not having to dig for a key really made things nice. The room was both spartan and luxurious, perfectly balanced. The courtyard view rooms really were silent, despite the busy location. All in all, one of my best hotel stays ever!",5,2012,05,08
40,Excellent in every way,"Sleek, cool hotel, great location and a very helpful and friendly staff. The rooms are simple but elegant and very comfortable.Tthe window shades allow no lights in, also no digital displays something I treasure in a hotel room since light makes my sleep difficult. We requested and early check in due to a transatlantic flight that arrived early in the morning and were granted our wish, something sometimes difficult at other hotels. The staff made a point of knowing our names, we really felt at home.",5,2012,05,04
40,Friendly and fantastic,"The Alma is a wonderful hotel - from the moment we checked in, we were given the very best treatment.  The staff were, without exception, friendly and eager to help us enjoy our stay. 

The hotel itself is very stylish and sophisticated and offers a bit of peace and quiet after a long day in the bustling city.  We had a Superior Room, containing a larger-than-king-size bed, desk and chair, large TV, enormous shower, basin, toilet and so much storage! Every night, we returned to our rooms to find the beds made, little chocolates, and water on the bedside tables, which was a lovely touch.  Our room overlooked the courtyard so we had no traffic noise whatsoever - it was the best night's sleep we'd ever had away from home!

Main meals are not too expensive (around 16 Euros) when you compare them to restaurants around the city, and was absolutely delicious.  The breakfast was pricier (25 Euros), but everything was cooked to order and the quality was extremely high.  

The hotel's location is ideal for exploring the city, especially for the Tour Buses, and you're just around the corner from the Pedrera, one of Gaudi's beautiful buildings.  The Placa de Catalunya is about 20-30mins walk away. 

The pool is a little bit too shallow for swimming in, but is in a very relaxing setting in the hotel's basement - a good spot to chill :-)",5,2012,05,01
40,Boutique hotel with stunning interior design and world class staff,"This was our first trip to Barcelona and was not disappointed with this hotel.  Was going to stay at The Mandarin Oriental but then saw this hotel and decided to stay here.  The staff at The Alma were wonderful, very helpful, nothing was too much trouble and exceptional attention to detail.  We will definately be back at the end of May.  Well done",5,2012,04,30
40,"Beautiful hotel, beautiful city","Booked two nights at The Alma for a first trip to Barcelona for my wife and I. The location is outstanding, very central location in a great area. The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. Would love to stay here again if we visit this beautiful city again, absolutely recommend The Alma to anyone!",5,2012,04,28
40,Alma Barcelona a perfect boutique hotel,"Located a few feet off of the most exquisite street, this is the perfect location to walk all over the city while being on a quiet side street. Hotel is beautiful, immaculate and service oriented. The pleasing minimalist design is extremely luxurious. Breakfast buffet has delicious food, the bar area feels like an inviting living room with a garden view. The staff was helpful even before our arrival. We arrived at 7am and were offered a room. Look for Pau G. At the reception desk, he is very helpful and knowledgable. Consider yourself lucky if there is availability",5,2012,04,28
40,Top Quality Boutique Hotel,"Many of the top hotels were full, primarily for the Barca v Real Madrid match so it was with some uncertainty that we booked in at the Alma .. We need not have worried. This chic boutique hotel just off the Passage de Gracia was ideally located and the service from start to finish was first class. Check in is a little laborious due to the sophisticated finger print recognition system, but I am pleased to confirm that this worked flawlessly for the 4 days we were there. The decor is very subtle and understated and for some maybe just a little minimalist, but it was very much to our taste and gives a very exclusive look and feel. The lighting in some of the corridors is very low and probably would not be too every ones liking. We could not fault the attention to detail of the front of house team who delivered well with respect to restaurant recommendations, and other advice. The only area that disappointed was the service at breakfast .. too often tables were left uncleared and the provision of crockery, cutlery etc at the buffet was slow and frustrating. This seemed to result from a simple lack of staff to cope with a full breakfast dining room at the weekend.But all in all this was a minor irritant and we would not hesitate to return the next time we visit this fantastic city.",5,2012,04,26
40,A small nice hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"One of the reasons we chose Alma Barcelona was a lot of thumbs up reviews on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The hotel itself is a very interesting building from the interior design point of view, with a grandiose atrium yet a very nice and cosy reception area where attentive staff is looking after your every need. We did like the fingerprint entry system to the rooms all the more so as I was travelling with my 11-year old son who thoroughly enjoyed such innovative way of entering the room. The room was nicely appointed in the grey-brown-and-white palette with designer furniture which in fact turned out to be convenient. I commend the hotel for offering to chose how many if at all breakfasts to take, and the quality of food was without any flaws. I d like to comment on the shower system in the room we were staying. It appeared to be working at its own pace: when I wanted to make the water warmer it was turning biling hot, and the next thing when I was trying to reduce the temprature it went back to stone cold. With a few stryuggles like that we eventually mastered the system but my suggestion to the hotel is to check it (I was scared to turn on the overhead shower :)), also but this is purely subjective the glass door or better call it wall was the only thing separating the shower area from the water dispenser area, it is great from the design point of view but not so practical.
To sum it up: a very impressive and affordable nice boutique hotel in the center of Barcelona with a very attentive and efficient staff. We give you a thumbs-up :)",5,2012,04,25
40,Very nice,We enjoyed our stay from the beginning till the end. Very kind people and nice room. Next time in Barcelona it will be Alma again.,5,2012,04,22
40,Finally a service-minded hotel in Barcelona,"We are just back from Barcelona where we had a family meeting and loads of fun. Since over 20 years we go at least once a year to this vibrant and stimulating city, but we never found a ""preferred hotel"", so we tried a lot of ""upper-bracket"" lodgings. Palace, Meridien, Omm, Grand Florida, Arts, Abac to just cite a few. The only one which came close to the Alma was Abac, a much smaller charming newcomer with a fabulous restaurant, but without the location. The Alma is right spot on where you want to be based (Mallorca and Passeig de Gracia). 
Very nice rooms and bathrooms, comfortable bedding, good tech equipment like reliable and free wi-fi (when will luxury hotels finally understand that a free wi-fi is part of a modern hotels basic equpment???, look at Alma as an example please), spectacular and pleasing modern design, which works and ""cool"" foyer, restaurant, bar, terrace et al.
But what puts this hotel in a different category is it's employees. A smile on their lips at all times, really helpful, eager to please and competent. Particular mention for the ladies and gentlemen of the reception staff who function as hosts, concierges and friends in the same time and really find the right balance between friendliness and efficiency. There are a lot of ""design hotels"" in Barcelona which exude hipness and a cool attitude, but the coolness also comes with a cool reception towards their guests and a lack of hospitality which by experience permeates the entire hotel and restaurant industry in Barcelona.
Thank you for changing this and be sure that next time we are in Barcelona we shall come back to our new favorite hotel.
Let me mention as well that during our stay the hotel was fully booked and that at no time this has diminished the quality of the service or the helpfulness of the staff.",5,2012,04,22
40,Fantastic,"My Husband and I stayed here on the 25th March for three nights. We came here on business,and it was also our first time to Barcelona. 
The hotel is small and intimate and seems to attract business type people. I think children are welcome,but it is really an adult type retreat.

It's very modern and chic and the room was really trendy with little mod con's (suite),we opted for finger print entry-so no need to worry about losing your room key.
The room had the best bed Ive ever ever slept in,the huge bed had two seperate duvets so my husband and I did not fight over a duvet all night. I want that bed!
Our room was divided in two by a room divider which has an integrated wardrobe and drawers,a TV either side for the bedroom area and living area,and also a mini bar.
Bathroom was large with twin sinks,shower cubicle and bath tub,with a seperate wc.
Bvlgari bath/shower products and also a hairdryer.

Staff from the moment we got out of the taxi were excellent,very polite and spoke great English.
Truly five star staff.
We would definately stay here again and would definately recommend it.",5,2012,04,20
40,A great new place to stay in BCN,"The Alma was our base for 3 days and 2 nights and the first time we've not stayed at Hotel Arts in the City. Its location is great and the whole place very high quality, clean and cool. The staff are helpful and the ambiance is terrific. We'll be back.",5,2012,04,16
40,Hotel Alma Barcelona,"Truly fantastic from start to finish.  Staff were welcoming, kind and patient throughout our stay - particularly the front desk, doormen / bellmen and housekeeping.  I travel a lot and have never been made to feel more welcome in any hotel. The staff at the front desk knew our names, always went the extra mile to be helpful and made wonderful recommendations for restaurants and great activities for children.  

The hotel room was quiet (we were on the  garden side), large (very) and clean.  The hotel has a subdued, calming style and feel to it.  I found this quite enjoyable.  I really liked the fingerprint key system which worked perfectly and eliminated the concerns related to losing keys or demagnetization.  The breakfast was good (best fresh squeezed orange juice we'ver ever had), dinner was light and tasty and the free mini-bar was a nice plus.  In addition, the location is fantastic and we were able to walk almost everywhere.  My only constructive comment would be to program the in-room heating to enable guests more flexibility to make the room cooler.

Over all, I would absolutely positively recommend this hotel and will happily stay at the Alma for our next visit. Five well deserved stars!",5,2012,04,15
40,What a suite!,We moved to the Alma after a disappointing stay at a hotel around the corner. Reception was fast friendly and efficient. The suite was large well decorated with a beautiful bathroom complete with Bvlgari goodies. This was a hotel worth mentioning and returning to,5,2012,04,15
40,Great Hotel,"The Alma Hotel is a great hotel in a very good location, the staff is really efficient and  friendness, the  room is luxurious. We appreciated the spa and sauna after walking  a day in city. We recommend this hotel  for a fantastic stay in Barcelona.",4,2012,04,15
40,As it should be...perfect!,"Good location, great value. Excellent boutique hotel.",5,2012,04,14
40,"Very nice boutique hotel, centrally located","The Alma Hotel Barcelona is a nice, centrally located boutique hotel. What I want to highlight is the courtesy and friendliness of the staff, esp. at the front desk. They had plenty of great tips (e.g. for restaurants) and organized everything just perfectly. And when checking out they asked me not only whether I liked the stay but also about suggestions to improve the guest experience.
An ingenious feature is their key system – your room-key is your finger print, you don’t need to worry about losing or forgetting it. We had an executive suite: lots of space and a nice bathroom, though a bit dark (the room, not the bathroom). The only thing I missed was a coffee maker (they promised to consider this idea). The spa area is not huge (no surprise considering the size of the hotel), but has everything we needed: a long pool, a small gym, a sauna and a steam sauna.",5,2012,04,08
40,Ticks all the boxes,"Centrally located, quiet, luxurious, private, discreet, friendly, efficient, clean, spacious rooms, stylish, comfortable. We travel to Barcelona regularly, and the Alma is our favourite place to stay-in to date. Will definitely stay there again when next in town.",5,2012,04,07
40,"Good location, excellent staff","Spent 6 nights there and left just before the strike. The Alma provides a quiet respite from the busy, noisy streets humming with motor bikes. The staff though young, works hard to provide you with attention and always smiles. The rooms are as advertised (we stayed in a grand deluxe with quiet courtyard back view) and are kept very clean with a nice turn down service (fied bed, slippers, water and a candy to end your day). The location was perfect. Barcelona is an easy walking-city and within 2 miles from the hotel one can see many of Barcelona's best attractions. Many are even much closer. Did not eat at the hotel but did have a coffee for a reasonable price. One negative is the gym is not really a gym by most hotel standards. Still, we walked about 5 miles a day and got our exercise that way.I would stay here again without question,",5,2012,03,29
40,Great Hotel!,"I will come again definitely. Very friendly staff and a very one of kind reception desk. 
Unfortunately the roof terrace is still under construction, but will be opened soon.",5,2012,03,26
40,Really nice boutique hotel,"Great service - champagne when you check in, very friendly staff. The room was spacious and luxurious. The free mini bar is a nice touch as well. It's moments away from the main shopping area and a nice walk to the gothic district and the beach. Definitely recommend staying here. There's nothing not to love.",5,2012,03,25
40,Perfect,"We had a ""standard"" room, which is already in the 40sq m range. Everything is stylish, and the bathroom is huge. Breakfast is first class as well. In line with what you expect from a 5* rating. Central location (metro Diagonal) and staff very helpful. Not what you would call ""cheap"", but the price is justified.",5,2012,03,22
40,Very pleasant week-end,"This was our first week-end in Barcelona. Alma hotel is great and we regret nothing at all ; the service was good, especially champagne at the arrival, the pick-up service at the airport.

As we arrived late in the evening at the hotel, they served some foods even their restaurant was closed.

The room was cosy and big, really perfect to rest. From our window we had a view on the backyards, it was quiet, not any noise - we had an impression to be the only clients of the hotel :) (of course not).

Employees are nice, hospitable.
They even helped us in web-checking of our return flight home. We also had the possibility to let our luggage at the hotel after our check-out until our evening flight.

We might only point out that the cost of the breakfast is a too expensive, even for a starred hotel.",5,2012,03,20
40,Modern elegance in the heart of Eixample,"The Alma is an intimate and beautifully appointed hotel. The staff are exceptionally accommodating. The rooms are luxurious and large, and the spa is a great bonus. Our stay was as near to perfection as one could imagine, and the cost was quite reasonable.",5,2012,03,17
40,A perfect mix of modern and historic in the middle of everything,"Alma has been opened for 9 months - we were thrilled we found it! From our arrival from the airport w no euros for the taxi (which the valet immediately paid, no questions asked) to the sleek, elegant decor, this place covers the details.  We were here for 3 nights, just 1/2 block from the great shopping street, Gaudi buildings and lots of restaurant options. The bathroom is unbelievable - huge white marble shower (for two?) w rain shower head and a great separate soaking tub. Super comfy bed. Had breakfast our last morning, yes, a bit pricey at 50 euros for two, but it was beautiful. Incredibly helpful staff, cool fingerprint access room key and every comfort with simple elegance. note: Fitness center is basically a sauna, steam room  pool and a small room with a few basic weights.",5,2012,03,13
40,"Very nice, but...","This Alma is very nice and the service is first rate!  My only reason for taking away a star is the lack of a proper fitness Center (the spa isnt really a spa) and it is impossible to open a window in the room. Otherwise, excellent!",4,2012,03,13
40,Worth every penny,"I spent the weekend at Alma with my partner and we were very happy with the hotel and staff. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The designers of the hotel created a serene space and did not fail to pay attention to the smallest of details. The staff was nice and attentive. They understood the importance of subtle service only really executed properly in some countries in Asia and Asian-owned service establishments. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a tranquil space in the middle of bustling Barcelona. I would also recommend it if you care about high-quality design, a professional staff, and reasonable price.",5,2012,03,12
40,"cool hotel with innovative style, and very warm service","was really different with high minimalistic design features, but still a very warm and personal service!
enjoy it when you are in Barcelona",5,2012,03,11
40,Flawless,"If you are visiting Barcelona, stay here. This hotel is quite amazing and defintely one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The location is perfect

Check-in staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient offering some great advice on what to do on our first visit to Barcelona and to top it all check-in came with a complimentary glass of cava (or mineral water or juice) and was a nice touch and start to our break.

The rooms are spacious, beautifully appointed in a modern style and spotlessly clean. The bathroom and shower is huge and very luxurious with Bulgari toiletries. The bed was very very comfortable with great bed linen and plenty large enough for my 6' 4"" frame. Finally our room faced away from the street and had a lovely view of the courtyard.

Breakfast was very good, sounded a little expensive at 25euros pp, but when you consider that we have a cooked to order breakfast, 2 cups of excellent coffee, a glass of freshly squeezed OJ, toast, pastries, fruit, yogurt all brought freshly out to you (i.e. not as part of a buffet) this was a actually a worthwhile indulgence and set us up for our first day perfectly.

We didn't try and bar or restaurant, but they looked very nice and there isa  new roof top bar opening in the summer which would be a great place for a drink as the views from the roof are pretty good.

There is also an excellent gym, pool and spa area which is a nice relaxing place to unwind from a day's walking around the city

Overall this hotel offers overything, the location is excellent, service is spot on, rooms to die for and the general hotel decor is perfect. The only 'flaw' was that I walked into the balconette window as it was so clean.... Seriously this hotel is absolutely perfect.",5,2012,03,11
40,Amazing,"This hotel is absolutely breathtaking from the moment you step inside.  Check-in took a little extra longer then anticipated as our room was not yet ready but the reception staff sent us to the bar for complimentary drinks.  Definitely order the Mojito!

Our room was extra large and getting in there involved having you press your finger on the key pad to get in.  We felt very safe here!!

The outdoor garden was breathtaking and very relaxing in the evening.  I  would love to return here!  Friendly staff.",5,2012,03,06
40,Wonderful long weekend in Barcelona,"We had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the beautiful Alma Barcelona. The room was lovely with a view of their beautiful garden, The staff was extraordinarily helpful; they helped us chose excellent restuarants and guided us regarding transportation. It was a perfect hotel with outstanding service.",5,2012,03,05
40,Amazing hotel,"We travelled with a group of almost 50 people to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress and our stay in Alma Hotel was simply wonderful. First class accommodation, very spacious rooms, and excellent service. Also, very good location in the city centre.",5,2012,03,05
40,one of the best hotels in central barcelona,"...close to all major attractives , very chic and stylish",5,2012,03,05
40,Love,"We just fell in love from the first moment. This is probably one of the best hotels not only in Barcelona. Our room (we had an executive suite) was beautiful and really very large (also the bathroom). Everything very tasteful and clean. The stuff was very friendly – not just in a professionell way. They really were kind. Above all to our one year old child – charming, helpful and whatever we asked for there was never a problem. The restaurant was good. Of course there are better ones in Barcelona, but if you want to stay one evening at the hotel, it is okay. The bar was good, too, but empty throughout the week. The spa we haven´t visited. After we had left we felt the first time homesick to a hotel. We will of course come back to the Alma the next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2012,03,04
40,Wonderful stay at Alma Barcelona,"Our stay at hotel Alma Barcelona was simply wonderful.
From the outside, one would not assume it was a hotel – it looks more like a private club. However, once inside, it is an ultra modern hotel that provides first class accommodation and, more importantly, peace and quiet. We stayed there for 3 nights with the children. Extremely friendly, smiling and helpful staff was always ready to provide assistance with tourist tips as well as recommendations for the restaurants. We followed their advice and they were never wrong.
Location of the hotel is perfect – it is in the safe area, about 15 minutes walk from Sagrada Familia, and just around the corner from another couple of Gaudi masterpieces. La Rambla and the old Gothic area of Barcelona are within 20 minutes walk or 5 minutes by underground , one street corner from the hotel.
We definitely plan to come to Barcelona again and Alma Barcelona is the only hotel that we would consider.",5,2012,02,27
40,How soon can we come back?,"This is one of my best hotel stays ever! Centrally and perfectly located, but still quiet and relaxing. 
As soon as the taxi stopped, our bags were taken in, door held open, and we checked in,sitting in a sofa with a sparkling glass of cava - perfect start for our 10th anniversary. The room was large, very stylish and modern, clean with a separte shower and toilet. A small, but quiet spa, with a pool, dry and wet sauna, small gym, which gave a perfect start each morning. We did not visit the restaurant, as area is full of coffee bars, tapas bars, restaurants, etc. 
The service was excellent and the staff were helpful and friendly. Would love to go back soon.",5,2012,02,27
40,Great hotel in an excellent location,"We have a great 3 night stay in the hotel.  The staff are excellent - they are very friendly and helpful.  We were given a glass of cava as we checked-in and were given a complimentary upgrade.  Our room was large, well decorated with a lovely bathroom (enormous rainfall shower).  The beds were very comfortable.  We had breakfast the first day (which is expensive at 25 euros per person - it was delicious however - but think they should consider the price as we would have eaten there every day if it was as expensive).  We ate out the following two mornings.  We used the pool and other spa facilities - which were new and lovely.

The hotel is in a great district - we liked how safe you felt, how close it was to a main shopping area, restaurants etc.  We were going to the Barcelona football game and the hotel was really helpful in giving us advice on getting there and back.  

We used the metro a lot which was not far away from the hotel too.

The bar lacks atmosphere as it was very quiet (and the music is a little irritating) but if they improved the cocktail menu, adjusted the music and provided more bar snack it would be lovely.

Overall we had a great stay and would definitely return in the future.  Thanks to everyone at the hotel.",5,2012,02,25
40,A sparkling reception,"The service here is unrivaled.  As soon as the taxi arrived outside the centrally but quietly located hotel our bags were immediately taken in. As soon as we walked through the door we were offered a (large) glass of cava as we settled down in the comfortable reception area.  This set the tone for the visit.  The room was very comfortable and clean; the bathroom and separate shower were superb.  We did not partake of meals or use the bar, but the Alma's central location made it easy to drink and or dine nearby, and to reach all the famous sites on foot or by metro.  The Alma is a discreet, chic, 'grown-up' quiet haven and a perfect base from which to explore everything Barcelona has to offer.",5,2012,02,24
40,Short break,"We had a lovely stay at the hotel Alma, this was our second visit. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The service is excellent. The quality of the food is very good. We love the breakfasts here. They seemed a bit short staffed on one of the mornings. We love the rooms, which are spacious, clean, lovely decor. Free minibar. 
Location is excellent, close to everything we wanted to see. Right round the corner from the Pedrera. We recommend going to the Catalana restaurant, which was excellent.",5,2012,02,19
40,Excellent location and style,"Alma Barcelona is located very conveniently in walking distance to La Sagrada Familia as well as the Gotic Quarter.  There are many excellent restaurants very near-by.  Parking was also very simple, right around the corner in the public lot, but with the ability to have their valet retrieve your car (and cheaper than the posted rate at the lot, but still not cheap).",5,2012,02,09
40,Alma Barcelona a dream come true!,"Before starting I would like to thank Splendia, Luxury & Character Hotels, which is an excellent website for booking hotels of high quality! 
Alma Barcelona was a unique experience! The staff is excellent, very attentive to our needs and that make us feel like special customers!
And this is without doubt the hallmark of this hotel! The staff really “pampering” their customers! 
The hotel is extremely well located, very central near Casa Milá of Gaudi! 
This hotel is beautiful! Very contemporary and well furnished! Everything was chosen with the greatest detail and the staff responsible for decorating deserves our congratulations! The room is very cozy and very comfortable! 
Compared to other hotels with the same category I have to mention that this hotel promotes silence and peace to their customers! In two nights we never saw or heard the cleaning team! And this is remarkable because it is all done without disturb the rest of the customer! 
And this concern reflects how this hotel works with the ultimate goal to please and “pamper” their customers! In room also they observe this concern since this has an ante-camara like a hall, which protects the sleeping area of noise. Breakfast reflects the elegance of this hotel with enough variety and always with elements of great quality!
We have no doubt that it is an experience to repeat!",5,2012,02,05
40,"Excellent service, with cool design.","有一位会说流利中文的前台，能提供十分方便的中文服务。其它夸奖大家就看英文的吧：

Cool design ('less is more') with excellent service. Booked its 'Luxe Double bed room' with garden view, four nights.

The best part of ALMA is its service: prompt, quiet and detailed. With the help of the staff, we managed to find the place to get our briefcase repaired in Barcelona, booked restaurants, booked tickets for sightseeing, etc. The finger-points-room-access is as cool as the design of the room. The hotel restaurant may be low-profile but we were very satisfied with the room service. 

Will highly recommend to people who first visit Barcelona. And I myself will come back again if going to Spain again.",5,2012,02,02
40,My favorite design hotel in Barcelona,"Very nice design hotel. Much better than Hotel Omm that is a bit overrated I think.
Newly opened in 2011, not very well known yet and therefore more quiet. Service is discrete, very personal, and equals 5*. 

The rooms are nicely designed without being impersonal or lacking ambience.
Fingerprint technology is used to open your door so no more messing around with magnetic cards that often do not work. Very good beds for a good night rest. The breakfast is the best, no more queuing at the buffet; all the tasty breakfast is displayed at your personal breakfast table and you can place orders for your own customized breakfast.

I am a Barcelona resident and I pretty well know most top hotels in Barcelona so take this review very seriously! I will come back definately.",5,2012,01,30
40,"Stylish, cool and the best service in Europe","We  stayed six nights at this fabulous hotel from Janaury 7. We were expecting a ""business"" hotel and found superb place with fabulous personal service. Location is perfect for the Gaudi sights and shopping. We had a executive suite on the fourth flood overlooking the Calle Mallorca.  Very large rooms with great bathorrm.  The only faults were the funky design meant the rooms are too dark with too many spotlights and not enought light!  Apart from that the high quality friendly staf  made this hotel the highlight of a five week trip. Angeles on reservation and reception was without doubt the most friendly and professional reception person we met. Vera in the bar and Paola in the restaurant were perfect and the guys on the door, who included the hotel manager were fabulous.  And the fingerprint entry was very James Bond! We'll definitely be back.",5,2012,01,28
40,mostly excellent......,"I stayed here primarily because of other excellent reviews, but also because it had wooden floors and lovely fuss free decor in the rooms, and the total smoke free policy(all non smoking rooms) though obviously the inner courtyard has outside seating and it is directly accessible from the bar/dining if anyone does have to smoke.
That there was a spa/treatment and pool was a great bonus, but in fact a great disappointment as all the treatments have to be booked in advance as the service is outsourced! As I was only staying one night it was impossible for me to ""book""  with such short notice when I called the reception from my room. This is not a five star hotel!
Anyhow, the king size bed was very very comfortable, I had feather free duvet and bedding etc as requested on booking, and the room was calm and clean, though not so calm as I could still hear people in other rooms and people in the corridor. But it was tolerable.
The heating(digital panel for temp.choice) is controlled by the individual in the room. Great.

One issue which was annoying was carrying a great wooden keychain around with me as the ""fingerprint"" door key didn't work for me. I was told that I must have dry skin(??) How my skin could have dried up between reception ( where it worked as I registered on check in) and my room on the 3rd floor, I do not know. I felt so stupified by the receptionist's reasoning I agreed with her! Hence the big key.
The room service has  a very limited menu so don't get all comfortable to eat in your room. Not worth it. However, the food downstairs in the bar/lounge/dining (understated chic/modern with floor to ceiling windows onto the deck/garden area along the length of the room) was just superb, with a great selection of modern dishes and traditional flavours. The service was polite and without fault.
There is no tea/cofee making facilities in the room ( I am a yorkshire tea addict) but one call to reception and I had  a brand new kettle, tea, sugar and beautiful tea cup and saucer; and milk ( which you can store in the room's mini bar(contains non alcoholic drinks only).
One other gripe would be the lack of pay on demand in -house movies to watch. I was left scanning a thousand channels to find something to watch. It would have been great to watch a film as the screen is sleek and flat on the wall opposite the bed. 
If I were to stay again, I 'd take some DVD's to play on my laptop, and try to book up a facial/pedicure/back massage ""before"" arriving! The prices didn't seem that bad either.
All in all, much much better than most hotels I've stayed in for the price ( I chose the grand deluxe room overlooking the inner courtyard), and as someone who suffers from dust allergies, this place was heaven, with wood, leather, and marble. Not a carpet in sight. Just warm wood floors, wood floor to ceiling sliding shutters  across the windows instead of curtains, and ""proper"" heavy wooden doors.
Enjoy!
and very well situated in up town Barcelona.

P.S. For anyone using clinic Eugin
(My husband and I are doing IVF with clinic Eugin and I was staying overnight alone.I was returning to receive the transer of our ""babies"". I was able to get a taxi to the clinic(the receptionist booked one for me as I had to be at the clinic very early) and it cost was €8 and about  10 mins. Really easy.",4,2012,01,28
40,"A Stylish & Funky Hotel, in a Stylish & Funky City..","Very modern and chic hotel superbly situated in the more boutique area of this fantastic city. We stayed here for our tenth wedding anniversary January 19th - 22nd.

Not too far away from anything, yet far enough away to be isolated from the hustle and bustle of some of the more touristy areas, and yes, there is a certain amount of ""style over substance"" to this hotel, but we absolutely loved it.

They were kind enough to upgrade us to a deluxe suite, but even without this kindness we would almost certainly stay here again. The rooms are very minimilist as previously noted in other comments, the lighting is subdued to say the least but there is just enough. The reading lights are very small and direct, but adjustable so one can read whilst your parner is not disturbed by the light. We thought the beds were extremely comfortable, and extra pillows were bought immediately without any undue fuss. The bathrooms are outstanding. Bulgari accessories and the most fantastic wetroom with rain shower and a bath that you could almost swim lengths in.

The gym/pool floor was open. Not the most oustanding array of equipment and the pool is shallow but certainly enough to get a quick workthrough of a morning and get you going. We walked absolutely miles anyway - so if you're not getting enough excersise you may possibly be in the wrong city.The steam room was lovely but the sauna not working, you may have to ask them to switch it on, we didn't try.

We didn't eat anything here - partly due to the reviews on here regarding breakfast but also because we are fairly early starters and would wander around for a good hour or so in the morning before finding somewhere to grab coffee and croissants - there is no shortage of places to do this - and evenings were taken care of by going to certain restaurants that we had researched and wanted to try in advance. We did have late night drinkies in some good company in the bar though. Ouch.

Many thanks here to Nuria and Miquel on the front desk, the service from these two is superb. From hypo-allergenic bedding to booking (and then re-booking) restaurants that are difficult to get into - to taxis - to recommending routes to walk - anything seems to be possible for them, and not at too much trouble either. When returning to Barcelona these two would be the reason for booking The Alma again.

Downsides:
It IS expensive.
It really needs to offer SKY, or at least more than 4 English speaking TV channels, all of which are news channels.
WiFi is not good - but they make you feel most welcome toi use machines at reception for flight bookings etc etc.

We would definately stay here again.",5,2012,01,23
40,Fabulous Modern Hotel (but why on earth is no clothes iron available??),"Alma is in a perfect location. Quiet with lovely restaurants and great bars within easy strolling distance, close to all the Gaudi sights and in walking distance to the Bonn region and waterfront. Perfect service - absolutely faultless in fact. Staff here are the highlight. We had a grand deluxe room with brown hues.  We loved the dim lighting because it was able to be focused for reading but still intimate enough for atmosphere. The room was modern, comfortable and spacious.  Great shower. Good bar downstairs. We had breakfast locally because we enjoy coffee/cafe culture in cities like this so I can't comment on breakfast.  From the outset on first email enquiry staff were fabulous - recommending and reserving at the incredible restaurants that are in abundance in this wonderful city. The only gripe - no iron available for guests and we refuse to pay for a full hotel laundry service to have a shirt or two ironed. An oversight that needs to be resolved. This is not a hotel for such nonsense because everything else is modern casual at its best.",4,2012,01,21
40,Small and intimate with exceptional service,"Decided to go to Barcelona over the Christmas break on the spur of the moment.  Since we had had such a pleasant stay at the Alma in Seville in April (see separate review), we decided to try the Alma in Barcelona.  We are two adults and a 15 year who prefer to stay in one room, which can be difficult to do in Europe.  I called the hotel, and Nuria was happily able to accommodate us. We stayed in an Executive room (102) that faced the street.  The room was very spacious and nicely divided to accommodate all of us, giving us some privacy as well. Loved the extra large bathroom as mentioned by a previous reviewer ... always appreciate it when the toilet is separated from the rest of the bathroom.  Facing the street was not a problem ... did not find it noisy.  Other rooms presumably would overlook a large courtyard with a small pool (too cold while we were there, so this space was never in use).

Pros:
- lovely aesthetics and space
- location: in the Eixample district, and just off the main thoroughfare, so very easy to get around.  It was always nice to return after a long day of sightseeing and we ate at some amazing restaurants (Moo, Petite Comite, Trafalug) within an easy walk of the hotel.  15 min walk to the Sagrada, stone's throw from La Pedrera and the hop-on-hop-off bus, and no more than a 10 euro taxi ride from most anywhere we wanted to go.
- AMAZING service: warm, friendly, attentive ... this really made our stay.  Helped us navigate the best way of seeing the sights in the limited time we had, made dinner reservations for us and more.  Twice daily housekeeping service was nice, too.
- The beds were VERY comfortable ... beg to differ with a previous reviewer who found them uncomfortable

cons:
- room is somewhat dark (with its grey overtones) ... not enough artificial (or natural) light.  Since we didn't spend too much time in the room this didn't overly bother us, but I see what a previous reviewer meant when they said this.  Crying out for overhead lights.
- flat rate of 25 euros for breakfast, no matter if you want just a croissant and coffee, or a meal fit for a king.  We did enjoy the full-blown breakfast the one day we had it (and chose to make it our brunch for the day), but would have preferred to have the option of ordering a la carte if we had wanted to.
- room was a bit cold on a couple of the nights and it wasn't possible to adjust the temperature more than 3 degrees lower than the norm.  duvets were deliciously warm, but too much so, so we alternated between flinging off and grabbing the duvet through the night.

All in all, an EXTREMELY pleasant stay, and I would highly recommend this hotel to other travelers.",5,2012,01,17
40,Design hotel made for people,"We stayed in Alma for a few days in December as a couple. Chose it thanks to reviews here and were very happy in the end.

Location: not exactly near major points of interest but this is rather a plus. The street is very quiet, however, in 50 meters there is a magnificent Passeig de Gracia, which is very wide and busy most of the time. Shoppers will like that most of the major brand stores are located exactly near the hotel on Passeig de Gracia. We used taxi extensively and found it cheap and convenient way of moving around. One has to remember to bring hotel address with them because taxi drivers are not always aware of this hotel and hotel sign is hardly recognizable. 

Inside the hotel: the hotel is very new and they were not saving on small detail when building it. For the first time we saw finger print access system to our room. Very convenient as you do not have to carry any key. As long as you do not forget to have you hand with you and still remember, which finger did you use initially at check-in you will get into your room with no trouble. The interior is rich with use of wooden panels, metal, and leather, but is not posh or trying to impress sacrificing usability. It is a very convenient place. We can name only one detail, which we did not like. Apparently designers of the hotel think that bathroom should not have any doors and can be an extension to the room corridor… In December it was rather cold to take a shower in the open space. Otherwise equipment is all modern and easy to use.

Reception: all our good words go to this very important part of the hotel. First of all they all speak near perfect English (a big plus in Spain!). The staff was very helpful. Their suggestions regarding going out were mostly great and we used them all the time. 
Breakfast: we think it is overpriced and is too big. We had it once and then always used nearby cafes. You can always (even on Dec. 25th) get you coffee and a croissant for a small price there. 

Other amenities: tried to use gym and spa, but to our surprise they were closed for renovation. We were disappointed that nobody informed us in advance before we went down to use them. Reception offered to jog around in Barcelona, which was an interesting experience and is worth trying, but is not a substitute. It was low season for the hotel but still such things have to be at least announced. Another issue was poor Wi-Fi connection. No matter which device we used the reception was very weak and we almost gave up using it in the room.

If you disregard minor things (everything but Wi-Fi) you get a well balanced hotel for an adult travel where you get the most important features at a high service level and where you can comfortably spend few nights doing business or leisure in the great city of Barcelona!",5,2012,01,15
40,Anything but 5 Star - Substandard in Many Ways,"If you're looking for an uncomfortable and functionless hotel that is lacking in warmth then you've found it! The beds are extremely uncomfortable and quite frankly hard, to the point where your back hurts when you awake. The pillows are also very thin and offer no neck support whatsoever. All in all, it makes for a very substandard night sleep and certainly not that of a 5 star establishment.

The pool and gymnasium are currently out of action even though they're prominently advertised. Why advertise what you haven't currently got? There's also no iron and ironing  board available though, you can pay 12 euros to have the hotel press 1 piece of clothing. Every hotel should have at least 1 communal iron and ironing board for guests to use. Surely this is something that could be easily and cheaply rectified.

AlmaBarcelona has large rooms with an overall good design concept but the rooms are minimalist to a fault and look bare and sterile. Some magazines and / or fresh flowers would do the trick. I want a 5 star hotel to be inviting and not cold and hospital like.

The service wasn't brilliant and the staff didn't seem to be knowledgeable. I asked a basic question of how to get to the Gaudi park and their response was to follow the tourist bus route. I didn't come to Barcelona to follow a tourist bus and I expect as locals, they have local knowledge that tourists don't have. There's also no concierge and nobody to open the heavy door, if they do, the staff great you with a grunt.

The hotel signage is non existent to say the least. Apparently a small sign (about the size of an A4 piece of paper) above a pot plant at the front entrance of the hotel is good enough, in their opinion.

AlmaBarcelona is the poorest excuse of a 5 star hotel that I've ever experienced. Never again, please don't make the same mistake as me! The hotel is expensive and certainly not worth the price, design isn't everything. There are true 5 star hotels in the same area with smaller price tags, give this hotel a miss. TripAdvisor you let me down with this one!!!",2,2012,01,12
40,Amazing Place,"This is a modern, sexy hotel that is perfect for couples. The service is impeccable, the rooms are clean, and its very quiet at night for sleeping. The bathrooms are huge, there are rain showers and a separate entrance for the toilet. We loved our stay and I would highly reccomend it. Great location to La Pedrera, La Lagrada Familia, and lots of tapas places. The only downside is that they dont have irons (but they have free send out laundry)!",5,2012,01,12
40,"Spa, pool, gym all closed for ""maintenance"" is not therefore 5 star hotel","Checked in on Jan 2nd. Long awaited break with the wife and no kids. Very cool looking hotel and in a great location. Key reason we chose it was because it had Spa, pool and gymnasium / fitness centre.
When we checked in we were informed that Spa, pool and gym were all closed and the staff had no idea when they would be opening again. This needless to say was very disappointing. I asked why we weren't notified that most of the Hotel's facilities would be closed during our stay....shrug of the shoulders was the response.
We were then told that the Hotel had organized access to a gym around the corner at 17euro's per session per person. so 34 euro for my wife and i to access a gym.
Yes, we were expected to pay an additional 17 euro to access a facility that should otherwise have been part of our stay at the hotel. Not to mention no Spa or pool.
I was filthy at this suggestion. They phoned me later and offered free breakfast as compensation for the fact that all of the hotels 5 star facilities were closed and that guests were not notified of this and where we were paying > 300 euro per night for our room.
I had to demand (ask and ask again) that the hotel cover the cost of the gym (17 euro per person) and provide breakfast. Otherwise our stay at a 5 star, >300 euro per night hotel was a complete sham.
They ultimately agreed to this. However the Hotel should have 1) advised guests that works were being undertaken; 2) been pro-active and covered the cost of providing access to other facilities (gym etc). Not wait for guests to arrive to find half the hotel being closed and then hit them up for 17 euro per person to go to a gym down the road.",3,2012,01,12
40,Wow...,I spent one night and it was a shame... how can you stay just one night in such a place??,5,2012,01,11
40,Slick and cool... but that doesn't make it unlike any other tourist hotel,"So we stayed here over new year. Great place, about as modern as you can get, nice big room, sleek lines, designer etc etc. 

Also a great location, and in the blue skies we got for three days, perfect for setting off down the road and spinning through all the shops and some good nearby Tapas joints.

The staff are really nice, like really nice, making you feel very welcome and very casual. This is when the stinger just took the edge off the hotel though. Maybe call me naive, but in a cool hotel (you know, one aligned with the style of a Luxe guide or a Tablet kind of thing) I figured, hey I'm new to Barcelona, lets ask the concierge where to go for some great food. After mentioning a couple of restaurants we had heard from friends or online to the hotel, they said that they weren't sure what they were not up very good. So we took a recommendation from the concierge and ended up in the biggest tourist trap of a crap restaurant in Barcelona. That was a little annoying to say the least.

But oh well, maybe that's my fault for thinking a cool and trendy hotel would suggest some cool and trendy places to go... But no. They also reserved a table for us in a place the next night. We went past the restaurant as it was quite nearby and the place was dead... When we then went to the one recommended by someone else the next day, it was absolutely brilliant.

The hotel was great, no problems with our stay in the actual hotel, it's just I wanted them to help me with my Barcelona experience as well, but maybe that's not a hotel's job! I do imagine they got some good commission however for recommending the restaurant we went to to us...",3,2012,01,09
40,A beautiful - even sexy - new hotel with immaculate service.,"Alma is, in a word, gorgeous. Very hip spot yet sans hipsters. The service was consistently world class and friendly at the same time. Great location too - quick access to the best of the city via foot or train. Would happily stay there again!",5,2012,01,02
40,FIRST TIME TRIP ADVISOR HAS LET US DOWN,"positives: clean rooms, good turn down service, friendliness of staff, decor, location, mattresses/bedding/pillows among best we have ever had

Negatives: free mini bar is soda and water lol; room service is horrible - received flat bread with frozen vegetables and raw frozen chicken; no bartender and no formal consierge... They must be under staffed because both of these areas were subpar for a ""5 star experience"", HVAC... We couldn't figure out why our room wouldn't cool below 73 degrees... We were told that the AC doesn't run concurrently with the heat... They turned the heat off but it was still 71... So we had to get key and open the windows...! Lots of traffic didn't help... No gym no spa... We had to pay an extra 150 euros for a gym membership for the week, 2 blocks away. 

We had a fantastic vacation, but we felt like, for the price we wished we would have stayed at the mandarin or the majestic.  We also loved all the staff but wondered if mgmt or the owners are making cost decisions that are hurting the place. 

Getting free cava, and the door opened for us didn't offset the little things that ""make"" for a 5 star experience. 

We traveled 42 weekends in 2011 and would have loved to give a good review because we think it's close.. But shame on those of you who came before us, you clearly don't pay for 5 star enough cuz you missed a lot!! ",3,2012,01,02
40,Hidden Gem in great city,"Even though the pictures on the website were not too revealing, the hotel has proven to be quite a pleasant a surprise. The level of service and kindness of the hotel's staff has proved to be worth a 5 STAR experience, and not just for the glass of cava upon arrival, every recommendation was a success. With a location this perfect, I don't think there are any other 5 star hotels in Barcelona who can match this. My 2 nights with my parents were great, will I come again ? ABSOLUTELY ! Muchas Gracias !",5,2011,12,30
40,Very James Bond !!!,"Arrived at the Alma on 2 crutches due to an unforeseen operations, was rather nervous as had to travel Aon my own and husband was not arriving until the following day. Well the staff could not have been nicer so I was put at ease straight away the glass of cava helped :-) 
Initially thought mmmm bit too über cool for me, but got enveloped fairly quickly into the cool design, dark moody colours and feeling of warmth. 
Fingerprints to enter room, über shower/ bath in the fab if minimal room.  Which I usually do not like - I want the chair !!! 
I was usually downstairs not until 11ish each morning, (everything takes a lot longer on crutches)  but they still made me an omelette. And the best thing is that everything is reasonably priced - glass cava €4 , €4 for a pot of tea, lunch €15 ish etc. unlike Hotel Arts which is tired and charges the earth !! 
The only negative is that there is really not any atmosphere in the evening ( most evenings we were the only ones downstairs) , and then some staff become slightly lax, but this is maybe the case of just not enough to do.  To be fair we were not downstairs late. 
Also maybe after 4 days the mood lightning and darkness may become slightly soporific ! I was inside the hotel a lot though.  
Will I return - oh I hope so and without the crutches !! Enjoy if you are lucky enough to go.",5,2011,12,16
40,Perfect location and staff with good night sleep,"We spent three nights in Alma Barcelona hotel. The hotel is perfectly located right next to shopping streets and sights, surrounded by nice restaurants for every pocket. It takes around 15min to walk to the old city and to las Ramblas. 

The room was big and decoration very minimalistic. To my taste it was slightly too little and too gray, but it didn’t bother and it is the style of the hotel. Nights were totally quiet, so we got a good sleep. Nice detail was that minibar beverages were free. The Hotel staff was great and helped us with restaurant bookings, even before the actual stay. Nightly rate was decent, especially since we were travelling outside the season.",4,2011,12,14

40,"Excellent hotel in an excellent location, a little too dark!","We stayed 6 nights in a Grand Deluxe Room, in November 2011.

Location

The hotel is extremely well located, on the northern part of Paseo de Gracia. This is a posh neighbourhood with plenty of shopping and excellent restaurants. It is however 10 mins away from Plaza Catalunya, the heart of the city and 20-25 mins from the Gothic quarter, Las Ramblas, etc. Taxis are quite cheap, we never dealt with the metro. You will almost never pay more than EUR10. Getting to the old city is around EUR5-7. The surroundings are extremely safe.

Rooms

Let me start by pointing out that (as others reviews have mentioned) the hotels decoration is extremely minimalistic and dark. I enjoy that a lot but my wife said she felt a little depressed which is understandable. The Grand Deluxe room we stayed in was extremely spacious and had a large window overlooking an inner courtyard (a large courtyard made of several buildings, not a small and depressing one). I loved the clutter free and functional decoration but as I said before, my spouse wasn't thrilled.
The room consists of large bathroom with a good sized bath, two faucets and a huge rain shower, a separate toilet (didnt find this disturbing at all as some other reviewers did) and a spacious bedroom. The bed is extremely comfortable, there is a desk near the window, a modern LCD TV, numerous wardrobes and drawers. As I said before, everything is clutterless, functional and modern. The shades are made of wood and when they slide shut, the room is perfectly dark. Good point for late sleepers.
You enter the room by touching the fingerprint reader so no need to carry a key/card around. I thought this was really cool: we didnt need to worry about whether we forgot the cards or who had them...
The minibar is stocked with free soft drinks. Some might criticise the lack of variety but I thought it was good: mineral water, coca cola, fruit juices and a couple of sodas. First time I've seen a free minibar so I think thats a plus.
Oh, I almost forgot the laptop sized safe which is a good bonus even when the hotel feels safe as Alma.
The bathroom is extremely modern and good looking. Very large bath, huge rain shower, two faucets... Perfect. I have never experienced any of the negative drain and water in the room problems I have read in other reviews.
Finally, there is free wifi in all rooms and all of the hotel but it has a tendency to disconnect you every now & then (more like 5 minutes). This was extremely annoying and I hope the hotel will review this limitation.

Service

Didnt use room service so I cant really comment on that. Nor did we have breakfast... A lot of nice breakfast joints in the surrounding areas, no need to pay the hotel for a continental.
I have however asked for help for restaurant reservations / cancellations and asked directions. Staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about where to eat. They looked up for train sechedules, called the restaurant to let them know we would be late, etc... I think the negative reviews about service are either extremely unlucky (they probably came across the one rotten apple in the whole market) or ill minded.

Conclusion

This is an excellent hotel. It is extremely well located and offers fabulous service. The rooms are large and well designed but some might find the dark atmosphere a little depressing. I can't think of any other negative issues.",4,2011,11,27
40,"Modern, Chic and Amazing Service","As a woman traveling alone, my first criteria was to stay in a safe neighborhood, so I chose the Eixample district.  This hotel is centrally located within the neighborhood and as someone who prefers to walk around a new city to get to know it, was a good base for my sightseeing treks.  The hotel is beautiful - very clean and modern with a very spare, minimalist decor.  I had a single room (with double beds) and it was very comfortable and quiet and it really was like a home away from home, a haven after my busy days.  The pillows are the most comfortable I've ever used - I must find out the brand and order some for home.  The staff was most helpful, truly a fantastic group of people.  I arrived bedraggled, exhausted and frazzled and they arranged for an early check-in for me and made the transition from a tired, messy traveler into a pampered guest very easy.  They helped with everything I needed, and overall, made my stay incredibly comfortable.  The hotel is no more than a couple of blocks from some of Gaudi's buildings (Casa Batllo and Casa Lleo Morera).  Luxury shopping in the neighborhood and lots of sidewalk seating in the restaurants nearby.  Overall, a wonderful experience and a perfect base from which to see Barcelona.",5,2011,11,25
40,Very good hotel,"I was there for a 3 nights stay. The hotel is brand new, opened in May and is made of 72 rooms. It is ideally located, very close to Paseo de Gracia, a beautiful avenue with a lot of stores. 
The staff is extremely helpful and nice from the check in to the check out. 
I tried the delux room, and is a very nice 40sqm room, with free wi-fi, free minibar (without alcoholic drinks), very nice bathroom with great roman shower.
The mattress is one of the most comfortable I slept on, while the pillows were all extremely soft and thin, that wasn't good for my neck. 
There is a door-window in the room that you can open. The view was on an internal courtyard.
The wardrobe was just perfect and very spacious. 
The only thing I didn't like was the breakfast, because if you ask the room service you can only get the standard continental breakfast. 
I also tried the restaurant for dinner and the food was always very fine and very well cooked, although you don't have big choice in the menu. The service was very good at any time and the room service works 24h. The staff always fast, nice and helpful.
Overall I had a very good stay and it's an hotel I would definitely recommend. But if I have to compare it to another 5* like the Hotel Me, which is not far from the Alma, I would say it is  probably a step below as far as food is concerned, particularly the breakfast.
The Spa was still under construction, so I couldn't try it.",4,2011,11,21
40,A very nice stay,"Very nice and large room, well equipped. Staff was extremely professional and efficient, yet friendly and without attitude. high quality food at very reasonable prices.

Only negative is the pool was not finished when we were there. Also no real restaurant just an area where you can have breakfast and lunch, not sure about dinner.

40,Dark and Sultry,"Once again I wish I could leave 4 1/2 stars but this time I will err on the side of 5.

So peaceful in fact that we had to set the alarm clock. For us this is the most important factor of any hotel. It is exceptionally clean, staff are extremely friendly and helpful, food and drink excellent. But the hotel is very dark with subdued lighting which is not to everyones taste - black and grey are used fairly extensively in the decor. The location is very good indeed and is in part of the city where we felt very safe. Restaurants and bars are in abundance and of a high quality also. All in all a most enjoyable stay.

The rooms are great, very comfortable beds, turn down service nightly and spotless throughout.  There is a large, flat-screen TV, but I would have liked a couple of additional channels in English.  We also had to ask for some more lighting, which was supplied in 5 minutes.  The bathroom is huge (2 sinks, which we love, and the shower was one of the nicest we have found anywhere).  My only disappointment was that the fitness room was under construction and not available.  However, with all that there is to do in Barcelona, I am not quite sure we would have had time to use it.  This is a great hotel.  They have a breakfast area and a patio restaurant also.  I just can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Go and enjoy!",5,2011,11,11
40,The perfect upmarket Barcelona tourist base,"We have just returned from three nights at this marvelous hotel.  It is in a fantastic location, within walking distance of most of Barcelona's attractions and just off the city's prime shopping street.  The whole building has been decorated in a very upmarket ""boutique"" style.  Even the lift appeared to be leather-lined.  Our room (a 50m2 suite) was very impressive at first glance.  However, after a while it did feel a little like a very luxurious prison cell - blank walls, no pictures, locked windows.  Perhaps the interior designer had taken things a little too far in their minimalism.  And maybe the designer should have stayed a few nights in their own creation.  Exactly where do you hang your coats?  And all your wet towels?  However, the stand- out feature of this hotel is the staff.  They were all incredibly friendly, offering suggestions and advice which really helped us get the most out of our stay - even booking tickets for the attractions for us and printing out passes to help us skip the queues.  We are already looking forward to our next visit.  Tip for UK tea-addicts - take your travel kettle.",5,2011,11,07
40,Beautiful hotel with fanstastic service,"This is a beatiful old building with a very modern interior in a great central location. The hotel is well decorated and maintained including the rooms which are spacious and very quiet. The superior rooms have great bathrooms with large walk in showers plus a bath (and Bulgari toiletries). But the real thing that set this hotel apart for me was the amazing service. When i arrived, I was too early to check in but they took my bags, texted me when the rooms were ready and had delivered the bags to my room. The managed to get us into a very popular restaurant at the lst minute. They also booked trips for us and gave recommendations on places to see. Nothing was too much trouble and they explained how to get there. Whenever you walked into the hotel they greeted you by name. And when i asked them to print my boarding pass it was delivered to my room in less than 5 minutes. I completely fell in love with this hotel - they make you feel very welcome and at home.",5,2011,11,07
40,Sophisticated and calm oasis in Barcelona,"A stunning hotel in a great location.  First class.  Staff was incredible - polite, friendly and helpful - all with a great sense of humor.  The design of the hotel was spectacular - great dining room and beautiful private courtyard patio.  The rooms were superb.   Furnished for comfort yet elegant and sleek.  It was hard to leave the room as it was so comfortable!  I did ask for a quite room and our room overlooking the courtyard was totally quiet.  This hotel was the highlilght of our trip to Spain.  I will go back!",5,2011,11,06
40,Truly a first class hotel.,"There are not enough superlatives to describe our stay at Alma Barcelona. 
The location cannot be beat, right off the most upscale street in Barcelona.
The decor is absolutely gorgeous from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms. The beds are probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in.
The staff are amongst the friendliest, most accomodating people with no request ever denied. They actually go out of their way to do more than you ask them (each and every one of them).
We stayed for 4 days and were actually sorry to leave.",5,2011,11,04
40,A Beutiful hotel in Barcelona,"Hallo...ths Hotel Alma is one of the most beautiful hotel I ever was in...evrything from hoetl room, to bathrooms to the interior is spotless...service is perfect and people are really friendly...location wise is also beautiful. I have read about it on many ""boutique hotels"" websites and everything written there is true. I highly recommend it to everybody...............ahhhhh....perfect I think both if you are for work or if you are there for a nice holiday....",4,2011,11,04
40,This hotel gets it!,"We booked 3 nights in late October based purely on the trip advisor rating. The experience exceeded our expectations and, I will add, we stayed at another 5 star property in Barcelona on a return trip through Barcelona later in our trip (one that everyone says is a must stay) and all I  could think is that I wished we were back at the ALMA. The manager has built a great staff who reallly care and go the extra mile; they listen to what you want and, above all, the whole atmosphere is elegant and tasteful without a lot of super status attitude. The location turned out to be superb. It is probably worth noting that if you are looking for a lot of buzz and activity around the restaurant , lounge and very cool patio, the ALMA is going to be quieter than some places.. That was ok with us -- we loved having those elegant spaces almost to ourselves!",5,2011,11,03
40,Exceeds expectation,"We stayed at Alma for five nights in October had a wonderful time there. The service was impeccable and the location great. We walked to most of the tourist attractions, and could sometimes came back to the hotel for a nap in the afternoon. There are nice restaurants within walking distance, and if shopping or window shopping is your thing, designer boutiques are just around the corner. We had some drinks and snacks at the lounge and it was all good.

It was a pity that the gym was still under construction during our stay.  Otherwise everything was perfect.",5,2011,11,03
40,"SIMPLY AMAZING!! 2 thumbs up!!
Top notch service and beautiful room.","The front desk staffs are simply amazing, i myself is in the service industry and i am truly impressed by the high level of service provided right from the moment i stepped into the hotel.  Very welcoming, friendly and i would add caring too.
The hotel is simply beautiful and luxurious. The design is modern and hip.  Everything seems to be of high end designer products.  Not forgeting the finger print access to your room is just so cool.  For once, i dont have to worry about my key card. I love this hotel so much and cant wait to come back again to Alma barcelona.
",5,2011,10,31
40,WONDERFUL,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. We had lunch and breakfast there and the food was excellent.Our room was comfortable, and the bed wow! best nights sleep ever! However the Alma greatest asset is it's staff, polite, proffessional and friendly. Cant wait to visit again.",5,2011,10,31
40,This is how a 5 star hotel should be,"From the check in to the minute you leave the hotel, everything is simply perfect.  Very well done, the ""lack of lights"" is more a plus than a minus for us.
And then the noise... or better: the absolute lack of it.  To our surprise, the lounge and restaurant was packed with people when we arrived.  Appearantly, that night there was a reception to officially celebrate the opening of the hotel (to which we were kindly invited, by the way).
Imagine about 150 people talking, laughing, and a some musicians playing.  Then, take the elevator, and leave at the third floor.  Already, the noise was a lot less.  Finally, step into your room, close the door and... nothing !  The sound of silence :-)
Seriously, during the 3 days we were there, we didn't hear anything.  No neighbor noise, no water running.  It's mind-blowing how good the sound isolation is.
Service is simply excellent.  The cava when checking in is a nice touch, and so is the free mini bar (seriously, how much do a coke and some water cost, and things like that just make your guests happy)
Breakfast is something special.  Do not expect a huge buffet.  3 or 4 types of cheese, 2 sorts of ham, ... But !  Everything is of such a great quality, that it really is a treat.  You can order anything you like, so no eggs that have been steaming for hours...  Is it worth 25 euro ?  Ehm... is any breakfast buffet worth 25 euro ?  Not sure, but certainly an experience.
If you can afford it, Alma should be on top of your list.  People complaining about a lack of shower caps didn't quite get it, I'm afraid.  Whenever the spa and swimming pool will be ready, Alma will be hard to beat.
All other 5 star hotels in Barcelona: pay attention !  Alma is the new standard.",5,2011,10,29
40,Forget the Mandarin....This hotel eats it for Breakfast!,"I stayed with friends and family at the Alma for 4 nights in October.  Check in was easy, they took my fingerprint....yes fingerprint....NO room keys here unless you want.  Had a cool glass of cava to welcome me to the hotel and received a nice little map of the area.  Having been to Barcelona several times before, this was all good and expected of a hotel of this class.  I will add the front desk people could not have been any more friendly....really nice group who made us feel immediately welcome.   This hotel is in the Perfect location...Near to so much and just far enough from the throngs of tourists swarming the Ramblas. 

We booked a junior suite and received a junior suite.  HUGE....with natural light from 4 windows....tree right outside so light and greenery....we loved this room.  Beds fabulous and duvets fresh and soft.  Bathroom to die for, rain shower, Bulgari toiletries in suites, separate bath shower, separate toilet area..perfect set up.  Room had high ceilings....two televisions...one a Samsung the other an HD Loewe....many channels.  If only one complaint....we missed an HBO or SHOWTIME movie channel in English....this was not there.  The room was spotless and QUIET with hardwood floors and comfortable lounge chairs and footrests that you melted into...problem was I kept falling asleep in front of the TV....but I digress!  Ooh and let me add that the minibar (no alcohol) is free and they refil it twice per day....Water, sodas, etc.  After having stayed in a ""closet""/room at the Mandarin oriental for our stay prior to this one....I must say I have finally found home in Barcelona.  Alma has so much over the Mandarin it is laughable....except for advertising....Mandarin wins on that :) and you Pay for it!  Can you tell I loved this hotel?

Property was spotless, gorgeous garden in the back of the hotel to sit out at night drink bottles of wine with friends and talk.  Bar area was also lovely and quite comfortable.  Food was fine, we only had snacks and ate breakfast out everyday....Barcelona really does have great food. 

I spend far too much time in hotels however I must say that I was VERY impressed with this property.  Worth every penny and they are on top of things.  Wishing you a most pleasant stay at the Alma....you will want to return again and again...just like us.  Cheers!",5,2011,10,28
40,Worderful weekend,"It was a perfect weekend in late october and a perfect location too. Position is perfect, breakfast was awesome and overall experience vero special.",5,2011,10,25
40,smooth stay in Barcelona,"Just came home after 3 nights stay in the Executive Suite with my wife and 11 years old son.. first impression when arriving are the kind staff at the reception, making sure that we are seated with a nice glass of cool cava while the pappers are fixed, and fingerprints for the doors are scanned..  in the meantime our bags are brought to the suite..

The suite are spacious and cosy hold in blue colors... ( a bit more lightning in the room would thou be nice ) A large bathroom with all the stuff you need.. 2 Flatscreen TV in the room.. one for the bed and one for the sofa arrengment  and of course the free wifi and minibar.. and the beds and duvet/pillows are great.

We ate in the resturant one night, delicious 3 courses with wine and coffee... so if you not up for the hussle and bussle out in town.. its definitely worth a try.. 

All in all... our best recomendations :-)
and we loved our stay and would defently come back next time in Barcelona...",5,2011,10,23
40,Amazing Staff and clean beyond words!,"A very cosmopolitan hotel with a lot of nice ambiance, the staff could not do more to make you feel welcome and be helpful.  You sit with refreshments will registering, they do fingerprints, so your fingers become your room key, nice security.  I am a fussy traveler, I like my room to be clean, even in the corners!  The Alma is immaculate - add beautiful bed, lovely linens, real towels, bath size, So maybe some of the little room amenities are lacking (I'll take spotless rooms over a shower cap etc, any day)  I bet if you were lacking something, the staff would get it for you if asked.  We sat out on the patio after a long day/evening in town and it was lovely.  A guess a negative, was the gym and spa were not operational, but we were too busy seeing Barcelona to care.  The hotel has a subtle front appearance, you may have to keep your eyes out on your initial arrival.  Minimalistic, clean lines, modern.
You are a half block off of Passig de Gracia, 15 minute walk from Las Ramblas and 10 min walk to Sagrada Familia.  We found the location perfect.   If we get the chance to visit Barcelona again, which we are sure hoping for, we WILL stay at the Alma!",5,2011,10,22
40,Good but missing some basics,"This hotel has many positives. The location is perfect, the rooms are completely soundproofed, large, and the beds are great.  The negatives are a lack of the ""extras"" that you take for granted. No shoe mitt, no shower cap, not even cotton wool. If you travel a lot, little things like access to an iron, a make-up mirror, etc, can make the difference between a basic stay and a comfortable stay.  For the price Alma charges, I expect comfort. Also, the room temp was quite warm, but you couldn't sleep with the windows open because the shutters wouldn't close over when the window was open.  My partner and I spent a few days in Alma immediately after we got married.  We were looking for a real ""treat"" hotel. We didn't feel like we got the luxury we'd anticipated. In sum, location great, physical structure great, but the less tangible things (that make a hotel great) still need work.",4,2011,10,20
40,A great find,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - and will definitely be back.  Great location, and fabulous staff.  They are trying very hard to make it perfect.",5,2011,10,19
40,"Teaching the other 5 stars how to do it, but not perfect - yet","Working hard to be a top hotel.  The initial greeting reminiscent of the 6 star hotels in Asia - sit at comfortable desk, offer of cool drink, water, champagne whilst you check-in and staff who remember you by name.  And then that awesome room.

All the other's comments are true.  Location close to the main strip, but far enough off to escape the noise.  Staff all really try to please, from the management down to the cleaners.  Free mini bar topped up with our favourite drinks (softies).

Breakfast courtyard an absolute delight in October, although the 25 Euro breakfast was underwhelming and total waste for us who are happy with a continental - no cereals, one choice of juice, and an otherwise tiny range of selections.  We never tested the cooked options.
This point left us feeling ripped off.

More than 1 english channel (the 30 minute repeating BBC) and a movie or DVD choice would be useful for those nights when we're too exhausted or jet lagged to do anything else. And whilst I'm having a grizzle, is there some reason why all the complimentary robes and slippers are only ever supplied in size 6!

Once they pick up their game here they will earn my 5th star.

I'd stay here again in a heartbeat, but next time I'll bring my own cereal bowl and a handful of coat hangers.",4,2011,10,18
40,"We found ""our"" address in Barcelona!","An excellent hotel. The service was beyond our expctations, the room was large, modern and clean and the location is great.
This hotel made our stay in Barcelona that much more enjoyable. We'll definitely stay here again!",5,2011,10,13
40,"Perfect location, great service!","My husband and I spent 2 nights at Hotel Alma in early October.  We wanted a location off the main tourist track- and Alma delivers.  The location is perfect and afforded us lots of walking which we wanted (only 20 minutes to the market).  Service was great, very professional and friendly.  Finger print ""keys"" were different and very convenient - you never misplace or forget them! Our room was spacious (if sparse - a little artwork would be a nice touch and some additional lighting would be appreciated - the rooms are quite dark), very quiet and overlooked the courtyard of the hotel with a view of the Gaudi apartment rooftop.  Overall a very positive experience and again - a fabulous location.
",4,2011,10,12
40,Shopped till we dropped,Wonderful hotel for shopping and sightseeing. Loved the rooms - very stylish and european. Staff made an effort to understand our spanish and did all they could to help a group of slightly tipsy irish women find their way round the city. Highlyrecommended,5,2011,10,11
40,The place to stay in Barcelona,"First of all this hotel has a great location very close to the main shopping area. Secondly the hotel is very nice and modern (just opened after five years of remodelling). Thirdly the staff is very nice and helpfull. Fourthly they have free internet and free minibar! One day we ran out of Coca Cola and asked in the bar. They brought us by the glass with no extra costs.

Only downside is that the breakfast is hugely overpriced, they should really consider this. Having stayed at many 5 star hotels, I will say that this breakfast is not near worht the price. Instead go out of the hotel to Passeig de Gracia, walk one block and you will find a sandwich bar serving great breakfast and coffee. A bit futher down the road on the opporsit corner you find Samoa and a Starbucks.",5,2011,10,10
40,Great stay,"My wife and I stayed here for one night on Oct 1st. The hotel is located in a great area and the interiors are comfortable yet stylish. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The coolest part was the fingerprint door key, every hotel should have this. Would definitely stay here on our next visit.",5,2011,10,09
40,Great hotel,"Brand new hotel. Very good location. Big room , great service comfortable bed.",5,2011,10,09
40,Would it really be as good as these reviews say?,"Yes, yes and yes.  Four lovely days in Barcelona and this wonderful retreat to return to each night.  The staff, much like The Four Seasons staff (ah, perhaps some management experience there?) greets you, helps you, remembers you, checks back to make sure all is well...and then there is THE CHAIR, the bedding, the shower, the deafening quiet that envelops the place.  But let's not forget the location.  Shopping mecca, wonderful restaurants, but still a short walk to everything you want to see.  We can hardly wait to return.",5,2011,10,08
40,"Fantastic Hotel, fantastic staff","New hotel with all the amenities. Fantastic location near all gaudi's buildings!
Extraordinary customer service!",5,2011,10,08
40,Service was not 5 star,"We were disappointed about the following:

One of the reasons we picked Alma is that they have a gym. The Alma hotel website states: ""...Moreover, the Sports zone offers the chance to do physical exercise at any time..."". Well, upon arrival we learned that the gym is temporarily out of service, as it is being refurbished. By our standard unacceptable to advertise a service and then not deliver on it.

Sometimes the nightly turn down service was not performed. Apparently, because we had ""locked"" the door when leaving the hotel. How are we supposed to know that we can't lock the door? 

Finally, the only English TV channel available was BBC, because the satellite dish had been damaged by a storm. Fine, but should it take more than a week to fix this?

These points could have been easily avoided in our view. 

On the bright side, yes, it is a hotel with superior design, well located, and helpful staff.",3,2011,10,08
40,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic city,"This was our first trip to Barcelona and it's a wonderful city. It's got everything, from art, culture, magnificent buidlings to a great beach and excellent restaurants.

If you want to stay in this city I can't recommend the Alma highly enough. it's well situated; close to the main shopping street in Barcelona, Passieg de Gracia and within easy walking distance of all the other sights. The hotel is quiet and the staff are so friendly. The rooms are very minimalist but very comfortable. The shower and wetroom is great, it's like it's raining in your bathroom.

The only small drawback was that there are only a couple of english channels on the TV, but in a city like Barcelona you're not going to be watching much telly!

We would certainly return here, well done Alma!",5,2011,10,07
40,"Hotel is wonderful, the staff is even better","We arrived in Barcelona in the evening after a long day of train and plane travel.  We still had a bitter reminder of a terrible experience at the Amsterdam Hilton (we are writing our review in their site), our first in all of our years of travel, and were hoping for no more nasty surprises.   But the very moment we stepped into the Alma Hotel, we just knew this would be very different......  
      After being asked to sit and being offered a glass of Cava, we were greeted and registered by (very attentive and engaging) Guillermo Esteve.  As we found out, he indeed personified the smart, professional and friendly staff that makes this hotel a gem.  After giving us his undivided attention and specific details as well as advise on how to make the best of our time in that city, he brought us to our room, a large and wonderful suite with two balconies overlooking Mallorca street.  Stylish yet with very comfortable furnishings and bedding.  An equally large bathroom with tub, separate shower room.  All beautifully designed.  All glistening and impeccably clean.  We could happily have stayed there for weeks (and we are picky travelers).  
      The hotel itself is a 1910 building recently renovated: they kept the elegant facade and original side staircases and converted it into a contemporary yet welcoming hideaway.  The location is awesome, half a block from Passeig Gracia, steps from lots of restaurants and upscale shops, two blocks from Gaudi's La Pedrera (and the ""hop/on, hop/off bus if you are sightseeing) as well as a short distance from amazing Sagrada Familia.  The lobby, bar, and lovely garden with tables and sofas are a wonderful way to start or end your day with privacy.  It was clear that even for a new hotel, Alma's charming garden and inside restaurant area, was already attracting groups for late dinner and brunch gatherings.   I will remember the breakfasts and nightcaps at that garden for a long time to come.....
     But in spite of how this lovely small hotel is, it could have probably been unremarkable if not for the attentive and friendly staff who make you feel at home without a fuzz.  Restaurant staff, bartender, everyone..... I agree with Valeria in every way (please read her review), ""angeles at front desk and everywhere."" 
     Our holiday started with an unexpected bad beginning at a well known hotel in Amsterdam and the management at that hotel should take detailed lessons from the awesome staff at Alma.  
     Muchas gracias to everyone at Alma for making our stay in beautiful Barcelona a very wonderful one.  We could not have asked for more.   We recommend it without reservation and would stay no place else next time we go to Gaudi's city......",5,2011,10,06
40,Very Satisfied,"Freshly remodeled, and right in the most desirable location, Alma Barcelona was everything we hoped for.  Decor is very modern, not my first choice, but the service is just extraordinary.  Each member of the staff seemed to feel it was their personal responsibility to make sure I was happy.  Paulo particularly stood out.  Be aware that there really isn't any sign out front, so you have to play detective a little to find it.  Might be meant to add to the cachet but in our case it was just tedious.",5,2011,10,05

Incredible property, excellent location, impeccable large room with huge double shower, fluffy towels comforters and pillows, exquisite taste all over the place, ...but the best of all yet: the employees of the Alma!! Young, smart, prompt, resourceful, polite but dis-contracted, it is clear the Hotel cares for making you feel at home... Here there is service and respect without ceremony... just like  you wish your own kids would always treat you!! Angeles at front desk and everyone, thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2011,09,29
40,Número Uno!!,"Checked in yesterday after a disastrous experience at W. 

Checkin here was excellent.  A keen eyed gentlemen at the reception recognized I normally receive Amex benefits. I didn't mention a word. But was upgraded immediately. 

The hotel is new, smart, intimate, innovative. The exec suite I'm in is fabulous. Huge, modern, comfortable...like being home. 

Henceforth, this is simply the only option in Barca for me.",5,2011,09,19

40,Modernistic luxury in a superb location,"ALMA Barcelona was a wonderful end to our Spain trip in Sept 2011. Its location was perfect and much less touristy than had we stayed at Las Ramblas. Its location is situated right in between 2 metro stations. Best of all is that one of it is the Renfe station which connects to the Airport train. Either way was only a 2 block walk (less than 10 mins) to the metro stations. Lots of taxis available and the hop on hop off tourist bus also stops just round the corner from it. Eixample is also perfect for restaurants, tapas bars and shopping. It is in fact I think only 2 entrances away from Louis Vuitton and I do recommend the Torres caffe which is diagonally across from the hotel entrance. The Gaudi museum is also only 2 blocks down from it.

Service was superb and rates were really good for the location. I think the surrounding hotels such as the Majestic etc. would cost much more and being such a new hotel, 3 months old, we probably got some introductory rate that is bound to go up in time. Room was really high tech but only thing I found the lighting a bit dark and when we were there most of the facilities such as gym and pool was still being renovated. But they more than made up for in service levels. Plus we also got free mini bar drinks!",5,2011,09,17
40,"Immaculate Location, Service has yet to improve","Based on the limited reviews, I gave Alma Barcelona a try for our 5-night stay because I had a great experience at another ALMA.  My review below might sound picky, I have to rate ALMA BCN like with the alike, IF ALMA BCN wants to be a 5-star, then they have to rectify these flaws.

Location: Immaculate!! on Malloca ,a few steps walk to Paseig de Gracia. One block south of Casa Mila. 10 mins walk to Sagrada Familia. 

Room: booked a grand deluxe room. 40 sq m. is pretty spacious after checking info with so many hotels.   Our room is 301 (now they are only opening up to 3rd floor).  The keyless/cardless room entry is very smart by using finger-print , but  frustrating enough it took us 5 tries in 3 days  (the second day we were given a heavy key)  only my husband's fingerprint worked, mine still didn't work until I checked out,  I gave up to ask them to rectify it.

 The deco is minimalist, with a lot of open shelves. Room is dimly lit.  Closet is tall but with just a few hangars. Bath robes and slippers are there.  So much walking to see Gaudi 's work, I expect a shoeshining sponge or mitt in the closet. (No...)
Free minibar is a plus that supplement the absence of tea/coffee maker.  There are many electric sockets that I am impressed with  but the desk is too small to work on. 
Wooden parquet floor is good, I believe BCN winter is not very cold.  Granddeluxe room is overlooking the courtyard and also facing to many residential buildings.  The front facing rooms are all suites.  The toilet is separated from the bath room (with tub, shower cubicle, double sinks). 
Amenities is surprisingly deficient.  I have to ask for cotton wool & Q tips.  There is no shower-cap, fortunately, we don't need it.  The quality of  the Bvlgari soap and shower gel is interesting, it seems no matter how long I rinse off, body and hands still feel soapy.

They don't hve pillow menu as other 5-star properties, I asked for a firmer pillow, I ended up had 3 of the very soft down-pillow that still didn't help much with neck support.

The room seemed not prepared for guests.  The first night, our room temp was 26C, despite I have tried to set the temp down, but in vain, the temp is locaed at 26C   and the fan speed of the ventilation was locked too.   I had to open the room door at 2am to taste the cool air from the corridor.  The next morning I complained, then they said the room temp is set by their computer, so at the front desk, immediately I requested to set it to 24C that I m being very environmentally friendly.  

All these flaws, at check-in, they can ask guests, their desired room temp, the personal amenities they want (shower cap, cotton wool...)

Hotel info sheet, hotel in-house dept diretory or stationery are all absent, e.g. numbers for reception/housekeeping/concierge. 
The desk is very small, you can work on it with your laptop on. The chair is very uncomforter for working longer time.  
There is a leather lounger that you can relax but  TV is a bit small.  
Wifi is free and no hiccups.

Service: 
 Before arrival, their email responses were prompt.  I had two restaurant reservations made through them.  Savi at reception did follow-up for me and gave other recommendations. 

One disappointing fact is I  have never been to a 4-star+ hotel the main entrance  is never manned attended!  The main door is very heavy, after shopping with bagss on hand, every time my return, the staff clustered at the recpetion desk chatting, no one bothered to stand up to help with the door so I can enter.  I had to put down my shopping bags to push open the door with all my might   Under-PAR...

 The staff are very friendly but esp the concierge is not knowlegeable enough. At least two staff doesn't even know about Lasarte (a 2-star michelin) just across the street.  I asked about the Aeri del Port, they kept referring it to the Telegraphic at Montjuic.  Thanks to internet, they finally found it and wrote me a paper for the cab driver.

Housekeeping ~  inconsisent service. Free Minibar was not stocked up fully.  Given the hotel is so new, so it is very clean, esp the wood parquet floor.  The staff laid a linen on the marble counter for my bottles of skincare was very thoughtful.  Since water spashed easily with the over=counter sink, the linen was wet, I pulled it out for her to replace a dry one, but she just folded the wet one back.

Given all the hiccups we had encountered, we decided to not have breakfast in the two mornings that we planned for, we at first planned to have dinner one night.  We have no confidence at all.

Management ~~  we had quite a few complaints, on our 4th day, a gentleman called up one afternoon said he would like to talk to us.  I assumed he is the Manager or the assitant manager of the hotel, he heard of our complaints, then want to understand more.  We talked at the entry of our room for almost 10 mins.  I asked for his namecard, he said he doesn't have one, and would pass one on later that never happened.  I have never encountered a hotel management so unprepared (without a name card to self-introduce) to meet with a client/house guest!!   Until I checked out, I never get to know who was that gentleman.  In other properties, the management would invite you to go down to his office or the lounge to discuss about the issues , instead of standing in my doorway.. very different manner in customer service in BCN or just at ALMA.  I don't sense their genuine sincerity to lure guests return. 
  
Overall --  LOCATION is PERFECT.  free minibar in the hot weather of BCN & Free Wifi is stable, to some guests these pluses  may make up for the flaws, but for ALMA, they have the hardware to become a 5-star, but the software, the management, the heart to anticipate guests need is not just arts, it requires dedicated efforts.   if you don't mind the minimalist decor and  mingy amenities.  (ask whatever you want then).  A 4 or 5-star property should anticipate the wants/needs of the guests, not waiting for the guests to ask for each bit and pieces.  

I might be very demanding.. I do understand hotel tariff in BCN is high, but with the same price, I believe that are many choices out there along Pass. de Gracia or along Rambla Catalyuna.  We were very disappointed with the overall service.",3,2011,09,16
40,Superb service at a beautiful newly-opened modern hotel.,"I can't say enough good things about the ALMA Barcelona. This is a gorgeous modern hotel that recently opened in May 2011. They are small, less well-known than the other hotels in the same area, and committed to providing a personalized service to everyone. 

My wife and I stayed there for 5 nights when we first arrived in Barcelona and again for one more night before flying home. 

The rooms were gorgeous - very modern in their design with clean lines and an open atmosphere. King beds were standard as were beautiful rain-fall overhead showers.  

The only downside to the rooms was a lack of adequate lighting in some and no coffee machines but this is getting very picky. 

Overall the amazing service provided by everyone is what made our experience at the ALMA Barcelona exceptional. We were warmly greeted with champagne on our arrival and were made to feel welcome and comfortable throughout our entire stay. From making restaurant reservations, to printing personalized maps, train tickets and booking hotels in other cities that we visited, the staff at the ALMA were committed to helping us in every way possible. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona - although I do so some what hesitantly as I don't want the secret of this newly-opened gem to get out! ",5,2011,09,14
40,Understated contemporary luxury,"Absolutely loved the Alma Hotel, which was exceptional in every way.

As this was our first trip to Barcelona we were a little unsure of the hotel's location. However, the area of Eixample is perfect for great restaurants, bars and shopping, and only a short walk to the main attractions and the much more touristy (and less desirable!) La Rambla.

The hotel is stunning in terms of design; every detail has been thought through, from the Loewe tv in the room to the lovely peaceful terrace garden. Only slight criticism was the lack of a dvd player in the room and the costly breakfast at 25 euros each, although I have to say all of the food was delicious.

Finally, the hotel, however stunning, would not be a success without the staff, all of which were incredibly friendly and helpful. We will definitely return!",5,2011,09,13
40,Incredible Experience - we can't wait to come back!,"Hotel Alma, without doubt, is one of the most incredible hotel experiences I have had.  We stretched our budget, as location and surroundings were key - and as the taxi pulled up to the doors of the hotel - we knew it was worth every penny spent and so much more.  An immaculate, finely designed, luxury hotel - with staff that go above and beyond with their personal touch and invaluable advice.  Complimentary (regularly refreshed) drinks in the rooms' mini bar, robes, slippers, huge soft bed, with linen so esquitely soft - sleep was plentyful.  There was no noise, disturbance or issue, a beautiful view from the window (a glimpse of the roof terrace tips of Gaudi's Casa Mila), the tropical sized shower in the wet room and furniture so luxurious and stylish - we looked forward to relaxing in our room inbetween a hectic schedule of sight seeing in this fantastic city.  Nearby, there is a wonderful tapas bar named Tapas De Madre, where the food and service was also divine - and then a relaxing night cap in Hotel Alma's tranquil gardens - before retiring to our heavenly room.  Cannot wait to return (and hopefully) in the not too distant future.  Thanks so much",5,2011,09,12
40,"Fantastic hotel, we greatly recommend!","We spent a very romantic long weekend here beginning september 2011 and absolutely loved it : the hotel is very centrally located (5mn from Sagrada Familia, Ramblas, Gaudi House...), the rooms (we had a Deluxe double overviewing the patio/garden) are extremely quiet and spacious and their design is great.  The staff is first class and the restaurant, which we tried on one of the nights, serves excellent food.  The hotel is brand new (3 months of existence) and we were told that a swimming pool and a roof top are under construction, to be finished by november 2011.  Not to mention the breakfasts : expensive but the best we ever came accross!  We highly recommend.",5,2011,09,11
40,Superb stay! An undiscovered gem in a great location.,"We really enjoyed our four night stay at the Alma Barcelona. We stayed in the 50m2 suite and it was fantastic. What was truly exceptional was the quality of the staff, they really looked after us and everyone was super friendly. The hotel is well situated off the Paseo de Gracia, 10 minute walk from the Rambla but more importantly close to the heart of the Paseo de Gracia which is a beautiful street.
The decor of the hotel is very trendy and the fingerprint ID for the room keys is a great feature, my wife and I always joked did you get the key? :)
Great hotel, great staff, and did I mention the fantastic breakfast? Very nice! Will stay again and for the money vs what is offered it is a great value! Muchos gracias Alma staff!",5,2011,09,04
40,"10 stars for the service, only 5 for the rest...","perfectly stylish and designed, service i have not had yet ever in that quality - only thing missing was pool maybe - but i reeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaly loved it...mentioned beforehand per mail that it is the first visit to a new city for my new girlfriend and me - got a bottle of champagne with a nice card from the reception as a gesture delivered for free to our room - amazing! we have been to la florida in barca afterwards and visited W hotel to check it out - but this place was outstanding!!! 5 stars - and 10 for the service!!",5,2011,08,24
40,the most amazing place ever!,"The hotel was extremely well located.
The rooms exceptionally clean.
The staff @ the hotel was unbelievable.  Absolutely nothing was too hard for them.
In fact, they are the ones who made the conclusion of our family holiday special. And this
applies to all of the staff not just a particular person.
We will definitely be back at that hotel again and again
We most certainly recommend Alma Barcelona to all, whether they're locals or travellers like us.",5,2011,08,15
40,"OK, You need to read this one...I travel A lot...and this place is BEYOND","So I came to BCN this August for business and pleasure; stayed at a place that got rave reviews on tripadvsior (and was really only just ok) then stumbled upon Hotel Alma because they just opened and hardly anyone knows they are here. It was a random find and am I glad I found it!
 The hotel was not busy and I liked it, but hope they get more clientele in the doors. This place is- renovated old world/modernist New York style very high end rooms, with the service to go with it! My room is overlooking a spanish style garden and the hallways are solid, sound proof, no smells or sounds- feels very luxurious  and well constructed- every detail thought of, but not in a stuffy way...

I have worked as a consultant for 7 years and stayed in some of the best places in the world- Dubai, Shanghai, Hong Kong, London...the quality of the rooms and the attention to detail here is superlative and comparable with the best. No stuffy concierge etc (go elsewhere for classic traditional service), but staff in sleek grey suits anticipating what you might need and doing it gladly. When I checked in,  Pao, the charming and very warm front desk manager actually anticipated who I was and I was offered a glass of champagne  (and a good one). He afterwards made several calls to my room to make sure I was ok; he and his colleague went to great lengths to get me directions to the beach and seemed genuinely pleased to be a part of making my stay enjoyable.

I dont write many reviews and I am writing this one while I am still at the hotel because I feel so compelled (although secretly I don't want too many people to find out as I am afraid the room rates will go up and it may become another loud tourist hotel!). I read a lot of reviews from people who apparently don't travel a lot and therefore are not in a great position to make comparisons- so will select a hotel considered ""exceptional"" only to find out its very, very average and the reviewer just doesn't stay at many hotels or, dare I say, may have poor taste:)

These guys are doing it right. If you are a business, or solo traveller wanting a no fuss, quiet, very modernist, but functional ""Barcelona-New York style loft"" in the middle of absolutely everything Barcelona...this is IT. No kids slamming doors or a hotel with masses of once-in-a-year buses of tourists...this place is a hidden (soon to be majorly discovered)  gem. Trust me on this one.

Only down sides: Breakfast is a whopping 25 Euro. i just eat down the street for 8 euro. Gym still in development (I have advised them to get hopping on this because the kind of person who stays here probably will want a gym!)

Don't waste your time looking anywhere else. Just stay here. Like, really. Ok, if you don't and decide to stay elsewhere, stop by and take a look so you can regret it for the rest of your trip:)  Great..Exceptional place. Rave reviews from someone who knows.",5,2011,08,12
40,"Great room and very friendly staff, highly recommended!!!","When we arrived, the staff were so frindly like I've never seen before. They gave us great turist tips, which were very useful, and made our stay very comfortable. The bed, bathroom and shower are deliciously comfortable, and we had a free minibar in our room! The Bulgari soap and shampoo are very luxurious. Best stay in Barcelona!!! Great price/benefit, although breakfast is expensive (25€) per person.",5,2011,07,20
40,"Cool, calm, quiet, friendly, excellent","I stayed here for two nights, about a month after they opened. My room overlooked the garden area and was completely quiet. The decor is minimalist, with ample use of unvarnished hardwoods, and the fittings and bedding are of a high standard. The all-marble bathroom was splendid, with a large bath and huge walk-in shower. The staff were really excellent - attentive, polite, friendly, and willing to spend lots of time helping with any need that arose. Both breakfast and dinner were served at tables set outside in the garden, which was very pleasant. The breakfast (25 euros) was essentially an entire breakfast buffet served at your table - delicious and enough to keep you going all day.
I will stay here again on my next visit to Barcelona, which begins tomorrow!",5,2011,07,17
40,A perfect stay,"I will highly recommend this newly opened absolutely lovely hotel. Perfect and very central location. Extremely kind and correct and yet funny and helpful staff - every single person. Very classy interior - you feel comfortable the moment you enter. Very nice rooms, free internet, free soft drinks. Very nice restaurant - lovely food made with care, absolutely not a sloppy hotel-restaurant. On the contrary. We will definately return.",5,2011,07,06
40,super,"Our stay at ALMA was absolutely outstanding. From the first minute we were welcomed with warm hospitality and felt immediately welcome. The rooms are tastefully decorated, spacious and extremely clean, which has contributed to an extremely comfortable stay.

We would like to emphasize the excellent service of the staff. Every staff member was always friendly, helpful and attentive, which made us feel completely comfortable. The breakfast buffet offered an impressive selection of fresh and quality food that left nothing to be desired.

The hotel complex itself is beautifully designed and maintained. The wellness area invites you to relax and offers a wonderful opportunity to relax after an eventful day. The central location of the hotel is also a big plus, as many sights and restaurants are within walking distance.

The only criticism is the price of the espresso in the hotel bar. With 8 euros for a cup we found this a bit overpriced. Apart from that, however, there was nothing to complain about and we would recommend the place anytime.

All in all, we loved our stay at ALMA and we are already looking forward to our next visit!",5,2024,07,17
40,First-class accommodation in the heart of the elegant city of Barcelona,"A wonderful, modern and stylish hotel with first-class service and very hospitable and professional care.

40,"Great, luxurious hotel in Barcelona","Very nice hotel in the best location in Barcelona. The friendliness and warmth of the staff at reception and in general was particularly noteworthy.
Our room was also very nice and big enough, with very comfortable beds.
There is one ""minus"" regarding the bathroom: there was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom, so putting on make-up was rather difficult...
",5,2023,11,21
40,A very nice experience,"A nice experience to be in a hotel of this level...wonderful rest, the bed could not be more comfortable, I have enjoyed the spa a lot, you have total privacy, all the hotel staff are more than attentive, exquisite treatment, food in the restaurant 10, breakfast 10.

I will definitely return at some other time, thank you very much for everything 🙏😇",5,2023,11,21
40,Getaway to one of the best hotels in Barcelona,"In my opinion, if a great hotel is defined by something, it is, above all and before the building, no matter how monumental it is, or its cuisine, no matter how many Michelin stars it has, by its staff and the quality of the service. that it provides to its clients.

With this criterion, Alma in Barcelona would clearly be among the five best hotels I have been lucky enough to stay in in my entire life.

The location is excellent, the rooms overlook a magnificent apple garden (according to a friend, the best in l'Eixample and perhaps in all of Barcelona), the bed and bath linen is magnificent, the decoration of the hotel and the rooms (including certain small details such as the typography of the room numbers or the blocks) border on the same very high level, and thus a very long etcetera in which the breakfast would deserve a separate chapter due to how varied it is, the enormous quality of the product and the fantastic presentation.

It is not a cheap hotel, but, as I said, if it is worth the price (and I think it is, by a long shot) it is, above all, because of the human and professional quality of those who serve their guests.

It was a delight to interact with all the hotel staff: from the reception to the last hotel maid, without excluding a single one.

Thank you so much.",5,2023,10,24
40,An incredible terrace,"Excellent location!!! A few steps from Paseo de Gracia, very close to La Pedrera and Casa Batllo, modern with an incredible terrace for dinner or a drink, very good breakfast, very attentive bar staff, as well as the people at the reception, modern rooms good quality of bedding as well as the quality of towels and amenities in the bathroom, we would definitely return!!!",5,2023,10,10
40,The Alma hotel is synonymous with excellence,"For me, the Alma hotel is synonymous with excellence, in the treatment, the professionalism of each and every one of the people who work at the hotel to make the Alma experience perfect, the exquisite quality in the rooms, the mattresses and the Soul pillows, they are unbeatable. And what can we say about the restaurant, it is a festival for the palates of the lucky ones who eat or dine there. And breakfast? There is no better breakfast! Always calculate your breakfast time generously, you will appreciate it.
The Alma hotel is the place where you always want to return.",5,2023,10,03
40,Aussergewöhnliches  Hotel,"Wir hatten die Gelegenheit, drei Übernachtungen im Hotel Alma zu erleben. Das Zimmer war äusserst ruhig zur Gartenseite gelegen und selbst der Lärm des Feuerwerks zum Fest St. Juan konnte unsere Nachtruhe nicht stören.
Des Spa-Bereich wird stundenweise pro Zimmer reserviert - eine sehr angenehme Lösung!
Das Personal war äusserst freundlich und aufmerksam, das Angebot beim Frühstück exzeptionell!
Kurz zusammengefasst:
Allein das Hotel ist schon eine Reise wert, in Kombination mit der Stadt unbedingt empfehlenswert. Zur Besichtigung Barcelonas ist die zentrale Lage ein richtiger Vorteil.",5,2023,06,25
40,Una pequeña decepción,"Hotel de 5 estrellas GL, bajo esta nomenclatura uno espera que esté a la altura, pero no fue así, siendo un hotel bastante normal y bastante caro para lo que fue la experiencia. El personal ciertamente muy amable, aunque cuando hicimos el check in nos dieron una habitación habilitada para discapacitados, con una serie de inconvenientes si no lo eres, por lo que solicitamos un cambio de habitación. No entiendo como teniendo habitaciones disponibles se nos adjudica una habitación habilitada específicamente para personas con discapacidad, no lo entiendo. Una vez en la habitación nueva, no hay espejo de cuerpo entero y tampoco espejo de maquillaje, al pedirlo nos dicen que esos pequeños lujos corresponden a habitaciones superiores :-((((((( en fin no fue la respuesta más inteligente, incremento nuestra frustración. 
La ducha casi sin presión, aunque muy generosa de espacio era muy pobre en agua lo cual fue una decepción.
No hubo reacción por parte del personal de recepción a la hora de tener un detalle en la factura lo cual me molesto bastante, tuvieron la amabilidad de ponernos una botella de Cava en la habitación, pena la nuestra que no bebemos Cava :-(((( creo que esos detalles son simbólicos, ya que yo aunque bebiera Cava no me bebería una botella !!!!  Me hubiera gustado mas algo pragmático como un detalle en la factura, una invitación al desayuno que en este hotel es de 50,00€ por persona lo cual también me parece exagerado.
En fin un hotel que parece pero no es y al precio de 600€ la noche sin desayuno incluido hay alternativas mucho más interesantes muy cerca",3,2023,06,11
40,"Personal herausragend, Design Top, Lage gut, Spa so lala.","Tolles Design im ganzen Haus, schöner und ruhiger Garten mitten in der Stadt. Herausragend gutes Personal, ein sehr angenehmer, zurückhaltender Luxus. Der Spa-Bereich ist leider sehr kleine und die Sauna nicht wirklich heiß, aber in Barcelona braucht man auch nicht unbedingt eine Sauna. Habe auf das recht teure Frühstück verzichtet, da man in der Umgebung vielfältige Möglichkeiten für Frühstücknind später Tappas hat. Die Entscheidung war zwar für mich richtig, da man das Frühstück für diesen Preis mehr zelebrieren müsste, dennoch fehlt ein Teil des Erlebnisses dieses Hotels.",4,2023,05,21

40,Detalles que ensombrecen el brillo de este establecimiento,"Hotel precioso ubicado en una céntrica calle, junto al Paseo de Gracia. 

Decoración sobria y elegante. Ambiente relajado. Servicio muy atento. Habitaciones amplias y confortables. Muy buenos productos de higiene en el baño. Spa con una amplia carta de servicios. Desayuno acorde a todo lo anterior. En principio, todo respondía  a la categoría de cinco estrellas GL. Sin embargo, hubo algunos detalles que no estuvieron a la altura de nuestras expectativas. 

En primer lugar Alma Hotel no dispone de parking, lo cual no debería ser un problema, ya que junto al Hotel, en el Paseo de Gracia, existe un parking público de SABA con gran capacidad, al que nos dirigieron cuando llamamos por teléfono para preguntar, indicándonos que el hotel tenía un precio cerrado con SABA. En nuestro caso, nos desplazábamos en coche y con escaso equipaje, por lo que, al llegar, fuimos directamente a aparcar el coche en el parking. En el momento de realizar el check-out, preguntamos por el precio del parking y nos dijeron que, al haber aparcado directamente sin pasar primero por la recepción del hotel, deberíamos pagar directamente a SABA. Este detalle me pareció sumamente desagradable. Cierto es que nosotros no habíamos pasado por la recepción del hotel antes de aparcar el coche, pero cuando alguien se aloja en un hotel de esta categoría lo que espera son atenciones, todo atenciones, y en este caso lo que recibimos fue una burda excusa para no asumir el coste de un servicio que, por otra parte, era ridículo, comparado con el coste de la habitación.

Entiendo que el parking no es parte del negocio de Alma Hotel. Pero los huéspedes deben ser siempre tratados con deferencia, incluso cuando, como ocurrió en este caso, no se les ha informado debidamente de un determinado procedimiento.

Para mi, un servicio de calidad se distingue por esos pequeños detalles.",4,2023,02,02

La camera è molto spaziosa, silenziosa e ben arredata. Il servizio di pulizia è molto meticoloso (anche se un po’ invadente: sono entranti in stanza un paio di volte senza bussare con noi all’interno). La colazione è veramente ottima e ricca di prodotti freschi ed è servita in uno splendido giardino.

Llegamos con una recomendación de un@s amig@s, muchas ganas y las expectativas muy altas. Nos fuimos con el estómago feliz y relajad@s, un recuerdo inolvidable y las expectativas más que superadas. Masaje a 2, spa, cóctel en el jardín (cuquísimo y muy íntimo) seguido de una cena de 10, desayuno en la cama... Definitivamente en Alma han dado con la receta del amor. 

¿La única queja? No pude concentrarme bien en disfrutar del desayuno (pe-da-zo de desayuno). Estaba demasiado ocupada pensando en cómo meter el colchón en la maleta sin que se notase mucho. Spoiler: no cabe, mejor haz como nosotr@s y prometeos volved muy, muy pronto.",5,2021,08,19

Como decía, la cena, grata experiencia. El restaurante es precioso, el hecho de que el Chef te tome nota y te cante uno a uno los platos con su singularidad nos ha encantado. La comida francamente buena y el entorno, como decía, magnífico. También el trato recibido por cada una de las personas que nos acompañaron durante la cena fue muy agradable.
El desayuno en la terraza del jardín, espectacular, no solo el ambiente sino también la variedad de comida es digna de mención, de nuevo el trato, de 10.
En fin, una experiencia única, y que seguro repetiremos. Gracias",5,2021,05,08

¿Lo peor del hotel? Qué en algún momento u otro tienes que hacer checkout y seguir viaje.

Acudí a ellos para dicha celebración y todo fueron facilidades, compresión, amabilidad y profesionalidad.
Instalaciones fantásticas, ofreciendo serenidad y tranquilidad. Habitaciones espaciosas, modernas pero cálidas. Servicio atentísimo, siempre con una sonrisa en los labios y un servicio de recepción brillante. Un restaurante de gran nivel, con una presentación esmerada de los platos, cocidos en su punto exacto y con buena materia prima,  con el tiempo adecuado entre plato y plato. Todo ello aderezado con un jardín donde disfrutar de todos estos placeres, con zona de chill out y que permite abstraerse de la vorágine diaria de esa Barcelona cosmopolita.

40,Malos detalles,"Un hotel gran lujo. Gran diseño con una terraza interior muy acogedora, que es donde fuimos. Precios acordes con el nivel del alojamiento. Por eso, no es de recibo que no sirvan la bebida delante tuyo, me parece un detalle poco serio, hay que suponer que te ponen el cava que eliges o el vermut que eliges, por ejemplo. En mi opinión poco nivel para el precio. De igual modo no deben agobiar a los clientes retirando en seguida las copas.

Besonders liebenswert war Adrian, der sich rührend um mich kümmerte,  als es mir nicht so gut ging. Zum 70. Geburtstag meines Mannes stand eine Flasche Sekt und ein kleiner Geburtstagskuchen mit netten Grüßen auf dem Zimmer.
Das Frühstück war klein und fein, vielleicht ein wenig überteuert.
Die Spa haben wir einmal benutzt.
Es wäre schön, wenn ein Wasserkocher für Tee und Kaffee auf dem Zimmer wären.

Bonito espacio acondicionado y decorado con sillas altas y mesas para tomar un buen cocktail acompañado de tapitas para comer. Un atento y cordial servicio, la música nada del otro mundo pero había un DJ contratado para tal asunto. En fin, es agradable en verano estar al fresco y tomar algo con buenos  amigos. En cuanto a lo que nos ofrecieron mi cocktail, ""Barceloneta"",  estaba bien, una combinación suave de ginebra, limón y anis con pepino que resultaba peculiar pero agradable. Las tapas correctas, buenas, de calidad.  Precios altos, no olvidemos que se trata de un hotel calificado con cinco estrellas.

Sehr schönes Design, unglaublich hilfsbereite Mitarbeiter, funktionale Zimmer und ein idyllischer Garten/Hof. Das Frühstück ist für mich besser als in fast allen Hotels in denen ich war.

Ya lo conocía como restaurante desde su inauguración, y como jardín para tomar una copa o un café tranquilo en cualquier momento.
No obstante no lo tengo en mente como posibilidad para ir a cenar con normalidad pues lo localizo erróneamente en la casilla de restaurantes para momentos especiales.
ES PERFECTO...
...el otro día sin tener yo la iniciativa acabé allí para una cena de trabajo y fué perfecto todo, la tranquilidad, la comida, el servicio, el lugar...

...dónde encuentras un sitio tan céntrico con un jardín así en Barcelona?

40,Opinición del restaurante: Impresionante menú diario,"He ido a muchos restaurantes de los considerados los mejores. Debo decir que relación calidad /precio me parecio espectacular. Un menú equilibrado y sorprendente en un espacio donde consigues aislarte de todo. Buen servicio, buen producto a un precio altamente recomendable.

40,Restaurante Alma: con sal,"Terraza con jardín en pleno corazón de Barcelona, en un hotel moderno y en buena compañía, qué más se puede pedir?

Que sea un menú con gracia y elaborados los platos? - Concedido!

 Canelón con aguacate con atún y cítricos - exquisito, con su toque de sal y su salsa de lima muy en su sitio.  
La corvina no nos ha convencido mucho.

De postre cerezas con espuma de matcha y pistachos:  las cerezas marinadas con sal y aceite, con espuma de matcha y pistacho garrapiñado y menta. Interesante, pero no lo repetiría. 

Tatín de albaricoque y helado de almendra es más tradicional en presentación y sabor. En ambos postres hay sal que potencia el sabor del dulce, pero quizás abusa de los sentidos del comensal. 

En general, es una terraza que tener en cuenta, especialmente en los días de mucho calor.

Lamento no haber sacado fotos del interior de la habitación, comodisima, especiosa, de los mejores hoteles que nos hemos hospedado. 
El restaurante, magnífico, os dejo dos fotos de dos platos riquísimos.

40,Vornehmes Hotel in sehr guter Lage,"Das ""Alma"" liegt recht zentral am Carrer de Mallorca in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Passeig de Gràcia. Wer gerne nobel einkauft findet dort sämtliche Luxusmarken.
Wichtiger ist möglicherweise die Nähe zur Sagrada Familia (ca. 15 min.zu Fuß), der Casa Mila (ca. 2 min.) oder anderen Bauwerken des genialen Architekten Antoni Gaudi.
Das Hotel ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, der Innenhof auf der Rückseite sehr schön angelegt und lädt zum Ausruhen nach einem langen Tag in der Stad ein.

40,Hotel lujoso con atención exquisita,"Conocemos este hotel desde hace mucho tiempo porque nos encanta ir a cenar al maravilloso jardín que tienen.
Para nuestro 10º aniversario de boda decidí reservar una habitación y no nos defraudó. La atención del personal es exquisita. Siempre hay alguien dispuesto a ayudarte. Al hacer el check-in te ofrecen si quieres tomar algo mientras esperas. El chico que nos atendió fue muy amable.
Nos dieron una habitación en la 5ª planta. Para acceder a ella te escanean tu huella dactilar. Es mucho más seguro y práctico que con la llave de hotel.
La habitación era muy amplia y luminosa. La cama super cómoda, con diferentes almohadas adaptadas a todos los gustos.
El minibar era gratuito. Había aguas, zumos y refrescos.
El secador del lavabo tenía mucha potencia, cosa que las mujeres agradecemos mucho!
La única pega es que puse un usb en la televisión y a pesar de ser smart tv no se podía ver. Llamé a recepción para ver si me podían ayudar y tampoco pudieron. Es un detalle sin importancia, pero ya que es un hotel de 10 es algo a mejorar.
El spa es muy acogedor. Tiene piscina, sauna seca, sauna de vapor, duchas y gimnasio.
El precio es acorde con lo que ofrece el hotel.
Sin duda volveremos.",5,2017,05,02
40,Sorpresa positiva en el restaurante,"El hotel tiene una decoración y ambientación especial. Genera un ambiente de relax muy bueno. Y además contribuye mucho un jardín interior abierto que para conversar o solamente desconectar de la velocidad de la ciudad merece mucho la pena. Pero mi sorpresa fue cuando probé el menú. Cantidades medidas pero no falta nada y sabores interesantes. Considero humildemente que quieren agradar al viajero. La atención y servicio fantástico. Muy amables y cercanos. Toda una muy agradable sorpresa.

La atención y el servicio, un 10. La carta no es muy amplia, pero todo está delicioso. Gran materia prima, gran elaboración y muy bien presentado,.

40,Kurztrip,"Das Hotel hat eine sehr gute Lage, jedoch sollte man nicht unbedingt ein Zimmer auf die Straße nehmen, die Geräuschkulisse ist nachts nicht gerade leise, und die Fenster  sind nicht schalldicht. Dem Zimmer , Grand Deluxe, fehlte es an Gemütlichkeit, nur ein bequemen Sessel und ein Schreibtischstuhl, keine gemütliche Ecke, auch kein Tischlein.  Wichtig wäre auch, dass man den Boden mal feucht rauswischt, so waren feuchte Fußabdrücke alle Aufenthaltstage sichtbar.",4,2016,12,02

40,No se corresponde a un cinco estrellas gran lujo,"Es un hotel que no está pensado para la gente mayor ni para niños. La piscina mide 0,90cm. No sirve para nadar. 
No están cuidados los detalles. Las plantas de las terrazas de las habitacions mustias y sin regar.
El cuarto de baño súper oscuro. No puedes maquillarte de ninguna manera.
La graduación de la temperatura de la habitación la hacen desde recepción. Tú no puedes. Tienes que llamar cada vez. Es muy incómodo.
La comida del restaurante no vale nada la pena. Probamos varios platos y todos nos desagradaron.
El desayuno está medio bien. Pero muy poca cosa para un hotel de esta categoría.",3,2016,11,01

Elegante, raffinata hall, impreziosita da sculture pensili, e bellissimo giardino nel cortile retrostante l'albergo in cui assaggiare un ottimo tè o godere un perfetto aperitivo.
La nostra Executice Suite era molto ampia e accogliente, ben strutturata e arredata con pareti e soffitti di un bellissimo blu scuro carta di zucchero, letto eccezionale per dimensione e comodità del sonno, pulizia impeccabile.
Un piccolo suggerimento, il bellissimo colore di pareti e soffitto rende la camera un poco buia (sconsigliata a chi vuole tanta luce) basterebbe mettere luci dimerabili in modo da poter aumentare, a piacimento, la luce artificiale.

40,"Tolle Lage, herrlicher Garten","Es ist fantastisch, dieses Haus in unmittelbarer Nähe zur Flaniermeile Paseo de Gracia zu entdecken, mit einem Lounge-Garten, den man dort nie erwarten würde.
Ein wirkliches Granhotel, was Zimmer, Bäder und Komforteinrichtungen anbetrifft.
Das Frühstück jedoch hat das falsche Konzept. Es ist deutlich zu teuer, aber das muss es doch wohl auch sein, denn die Kaffees werden jeweils individuell bestellt, telefonisch vom Service bei der Bar in Auftrag gegeben und dann (oft erst nach zwanzig Minuten) serviert. Permanent ist jemand damit beschäftigt, die Brote und Kuchen in die Küche abzuräumen, um dann dort ein paar Scheiben abzuschneiden und dann alles wieder nach draussen zu stellen. Auch die Eierspeisen werden natürlich à la carte und individuell zubereitet. Mal kam das Spiegelei nach 10 Minuten, oft aber auch erst nach einer halben Stunde. Die Mädels wirken freundlich, willig, aber restlos überfordert.
Ansonsten schöne Bar und wie gesagt: der Garten, auch im Winter mit Heizstrahlern zu geniessen.",4,2016,09,26

Dispone de un SPA al que desgraciadamente no pude ir pero teniendo en cuenta la calidad del hotel tiene que ser una maravilla.

Ni un ruido. Te sientes como si estuvieses en medio de un parque y eso consigue crear un ambiente intimo donde nadie eleva la voz. Perfecto para charlar tranquilamente. Además la oferta gastronómica es muy buena y precios equilibrados. El menú degustación incluye un aperitivo, 3 entrantes, un plato principal a elegir, postre y café. Todo por 39€.

La cosa es que entramos solo para echarle un vistazo y nos quedamos 4 horas! Un placer total, el jardín, tanto el servicio como el espacio. El ático tiene vistas espectaculares y se sirven cocktails con mucho encanto. Vamos, que nos declaramos clientes del Alma.",5,2016,08,12

Y bueno el servicio buenisimo, súper atentos y profesionales, otro diez.
Y para terminar un cóctel en la terraza del hotel, Paraíso, buenisimos, originales y otro gran equipo de profesionales.

40,Desastrosa cena de celebración. Cambien a la chef y mejoren el servicio. Desmerece al Hotel,"Desastrosa experiencia en el  Restaurante Jardín del Alma
El lugar es realmente agradable y bien ambientado pero una cena se compone tb de comida y servicio y ambas cosas fallaron. Cabe decir que se trata de un restaurante de un hotel de 5 estrellas GL con precios acorde. Lo resumo
Pedimos dos primeros a compartir. Ensalada de Bogavante con tomate y sandia y Ceviche de pescado blanco. Ambos llevaban cilantro o perejil chino como acompañamiento. Avisamos al llegar la ensalada que no nos gustaba el cilantro y llego a los pocos minutos el ceviche tb con cilantro. Pedi al camarero que lo cambiaran por otro y tras consultarlo con la chef me indico que lo cambiarían pero que cobrarían también el que habían traído. Ante mi reacción la otra camarera o jefa de sala acudió para intentar resolver la situación y nos ofreció como alternativa un salmorejo porque el resto de platos tb iban muy especiados.... De segundo un arroz que estaba muy correcto.  Lo acompañamos con una botella de vino tinto. No pedimos postre.

Puntos de mejora:
1. En ningun momento se nos pregunto si nos había gustado lo que iban sirviendo. La ensalada se quedo la mitad y nadie pregunto si pasaba algo.
2. Ante la situación del cilantro la principal preocupación fue cobrar el plato servido y no si podían resolverlo de algún modo (pagándolo o no, que en ese contexto era algo secundario para mi)
3. El vino, excepto la copa inicial, nos lo fuimos sirviendo nosotros
4. La chef ante la situación del cilantro no tuvo a bien salir a la mesa a comentar la situación (éramos cinco mesas esa noche)
5. No hubo ninguna deferencia o detalle para intentar suavizar la situación que se produjo con el primer plato.",1,2016,07,25
40,intento de tomar un piscolabis en el jardin,"Cinco amigas queriamos tomar un piscolabis en el fantastico jardin pero fue imposible a pesar de haber llamado y tener reserva. El servicio un desastre, no nos hicieron ni caso y tuvimos que pedir varias veces, al cabo de mucho rato de esperar, pedimos platos de tapas frios, y nos dijeron que teniamos que esperar 40 minutos. ante eso nos levantamos y nos fuimos. gran decepcion. No volveremos y no lo recomendaremos",1,2016,07,21
40,Decepción,"Mi opinión es sobre el restaurante en el jardín.Fuimos a tomar unas tapas y una copa en el jardín del hotel. El jardín y su entorno es muy bonito, pero nada más. En primer lugar las sillas de las mesas (son de hierro) son bastante incómodas para estar demasiado rato. Se te clava el respaldo en la espalda. Había también sillones bajos pero nosotros estuvimos en una mesa.
Las tapas estaban bien, pero lamentablemente el servicio muy mal teniendo en cuenta que es un hotel de lujo y sus precios son acordes. Tuvimos que pedir las cosas varias veces y al final en algún caso lo dejamos correr por el rato que tardaban. La comida (pedimos ensaladilla rusa, croquetas y torreznos) no estaba mal pero el servicio fue tan mal que al final daba igual. Una pena. Con no volver ya está.",2,2016,07,19
40,Un oasis de paz en Barcelona,"Tanto en verano como en otros momentos del año, pasear por el centro de Barcelona y visitar sus encantos, puede resultar agotador. Es por ello que una visita al hotel y en especial a su restaurante es como transportarse a un oasis. Su elegancia, ambiente y en especial su tranquilidad lo convierten en un parada casi obligada. Su jardín interior, donde se puede comer o tomar algo, es precioso. Su cocina está a la par de lo que se espeta, por lo que aunque sus precios pueden ser un poco más altos que en otros sitios cercanos, el resto de sus encantos compensan absolutamente.",5,2016,07,16
40,Unaufdringlicher Luxus & tolle Lage,"Das Hotel Alma hat uns in vielen Punkten überrascht.
Das Hotel liegt mitten in der Innenstadt in einer Seitenstrasse, von wo aus viele HotSpots der Stadt erreicht werden können. Bei der Ankunft kann mit Fingerprint der Zimmerschlüssel ersetzt werden, was ich ziemlich Innovativ finde und es zu keiner Zeit Ärger mit der Schlüsselsuche gibt.
Die Zimmer sind im gegensatz zum Eingang, welches einen Wohnzimmer Charakter vermittelt, eher clean und stylish. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sind mit allem nötigen ausgestattet. Das Bad wird durch eine Holztrennwand getrennt, nicht wie sonst mittlerweile üblich mit Glas. Das ist sehr angenehm und man hat eine Oase für sich selbst. 
Das Spa habe ich zwar nicht genutzt aber mir angeschaut und leider bereut, keine Schwimmsachen dabei zu haben.
Unser persönliches Highlight war das Frühstück und der entspannte Garten. Die Auswahl des Frühstücks war perfekt gewählt, tolle spanische Speisen aber auch klassiker. Die Speisen waren immer vorhanden und wunderschön präsentiert. Ich würde jederzeit wieder kommen und das Hotel Familie und Freunden empfehlen.",5,2016,07,09
40,Restaurante caro y mediocre. Servicio pobre.,"Mi opinión se refiere exclusivamente al restaurante del hotel. La terraza del hotel, en la que se ubica el restaurante es muy bonita y agradable.  Sin embargo, el restaurante en sí no está a la altura de un hotel de 5 estrellas como el Alma.  Pagamos 75 Euros por un menú cerrado.  El vino era mediocre. La comida estaba bien pero para nada a la altura del precio que cobraron.  Los camareros se equivocaron en casi todos los platos principales (trajeron pescado a quien había pedido carne y al revés).  El postre llegó a destiempo: algunos comensales tuvieron su postre rápido mientras otros tuvieron que esperar 15 minutos. Los camareros eran agradables pero para nada profesionales ni a la altura de la categoría que se supone que ha de tener este restaurante.",2,2016,07,04

Servicio atento y sonriente, comida basada en el producto con presentacion moderna. Excelente la merluza con lentejas, la ensalada de tomates y la de bogavante. El solomillo tambien buenisimo.
Los tés de Sans&Sans deliciosos.

40,Magnífico hotel,"Las reseñas encontradas en Trip Advisor acerca del hotel Alma Barcelona son muy veraces. Lindo hotel en el corazón de Barcelona, lleno de detalles, con una cordial atención, habitación realmente espaciosa, un «jardín del Alma» del que no te quieres ir, un estupendo desayuno (con costo). Según nos dijeron (desde luego no sus propios empleados), ahora es el favorito de algunas celebridades, como Woody Allen.
 Si hubiera algún «pero» (que para mí no lo fue), es que la regadera y el cuarto de baño no tienen puerta, así que si vas con alguien que no es tu pareja, carece de privacidad. Sin embargo, el toilet está totalmente aparte del cuarto de baño (al menos en la habitación que a nosotros nos tocó).
¡Indudablemente recomendable!",5,2016,05,19
40,Service hervorragend,"Wir haben jeweils eine Nacht vor und nach einer Kreuzfahrt im Fermont verbracht und es hat uns gut gefallen, wir werden dieses Hotel sicher wieder besuchen.

Das Service ist exzellent. Egal ob es sich um eine Kofferwaage handelt, um Essiggurkerl zum Frühstück (hat sich mein Mann eigebildet...), überall freundliche, bemühte Gesichter, nach kurzer Zeit ist alles da. 

Besonders geschätzt haben wir den Zugang zur Lounge. Dort gibt es den ganzen Tag über alkoholfreie Getränke, Tapas, Obst, kleine Süßspeisen, Kaffe, Tee, etc. in Selbstbedienung. Wein gibt es auf Anfrage, wird eingeschenkt. Hervorheben möchte ich die Qualität der Speisen und Getränke. Egal ob es sich um hochwertigen spanischen Schinken oder auch um Obst handelt. Der für die Lounge zuständige Mitarbeiter hat sich auch gekümmert, als wir länger als erwartet auf unser Zimmer warteten, hat das Einchequen gleich erledigt. Er entsprach voll dem Bild des Hotels mit kompeteten und professionellen Leuten. 

In einer vorhergehenden Bewertung wurde das Frühstück mit € 25,- als zu teuer bezeichnet. Wir hatten das Frühstück inkludiert und meine Meinung dazu ist, dass das Frühstück mit den Angebotenen jedenfalls das Geld wert ist. Wie auch bei der Lounge: sehr hochwertiges Essen und Trinken.

Die Halle ist schon neu gemacht, die Zimmer werden Stock für Stock bei laufendem Betrieb renoviert, ist aber nicht zu merken. Die ""alten"" Zimmer sind großzügig angelegt, die Badezimmer mit extra Dusche. Unser Bett beim zweiten Aufenthalt war allerdings eher durchgelegen, wir hätten uns eine Auflage bringen lassen sollen.

Ca. 20 m vom Hotel entfernt ist ein großzügiges Freischwimmbecken mit danebenliegendem Restaurantgarten bzw. dahinter dann Hallenbad und Saunen etc. Es gibt aber keinen ""Bademantelgang"", das heißt, man muss ins Freie. Das Hallenbad ist groß, man kann richtig schwimmen, nicht nur planschen, ist aber eher spartanisch. Es gibt auch die Möglichkeit Massagen oder diverse Behandlungen zu machen - haben wir aber nicht genutzt.",5,2016,05,11
40,"Servicio muy profesional, entorno muy agradable","Estuve tomando varias veces un té en el hotel porque me gusta la tranquilidad de su bar, y la última vez que fui el acceso al jardin estaba abierto. Fue una experiencia muy buena, encontramos mucha paz en medio de la ciudad : solo se oyen los pájaros, el ruido de las piedritas del suelo al pasar los camareros, y nada más. Ideal para conversar tranquilamente con amigos o para reuniones de negocios. Servicio discreto, trato sencillo pero muy profesional y muy agradable. ",5,2016,04,18
40,Tapatour decepción ,"Hemos estado en el hotel Alma para poder degustar las tapas de Tapatour, el espacio es bonito y muy agradable, nos sentamos en la terraza, después de 55 minutos nos fuimos sin poder probar una de las tapas, decepcionante servicio tanto de sala como de cocina de un 5estrellas gran lujo.se respiraba un descontrol total, lastima.

La habitación amplia, las camas muy cómodas y muy limpia. El único pero que las amenities sólo disponían de champú y loción corporal,echando de menos más variedad y el secador se recalentaba todo el tiempo.
La tv de Loewe, perfecta. 
El gimnasio pequeño pero con aparatos modernos y el spa muy tranquilo.

No tienes botones en la puerta que te reciba las maletas ni te abran la puerta.  Solo atienden tres personas para todos los oficios de recepción, concierge, y siempre están ocupados y toca esperar.  Si llamas por teléfono desde la habitación se demoran en contestar y a veces ni contestan.  Toallas estaban sucias.  Habitación executive suite con mal olor y muebles viejos y en mal estado. Te bañas y todo el baño se mojo porque no tiene puerta completa la ducha.  Este es un hotel catalogado con cinco estrella pero no debería tener ni dos estrellas.  El personal tiene personas atenta y personas no atentas.   No vale la pena este hotel por el precio alto que se paga.  Mala relación calidad-precio.",1,2016,01,04

40,Fabulosa joya en la mejor zona de BCN!,"Este hotel se encuentra super bien ubicado, el pleno centro de paseo de gracia. La atención desde el momento que entras es de primera. Las estancias minimalistas pero con buen gusto en la decoración. Las habitaciones cómodas y de buen tamaño....la cama es absolutamente sublime, y sus edredones son simplemente fantásticos. Tomar una copa o comer en la zona dispuesta es una experiencia placentera para los sentidos.",5,2015,11,24

40,"Se passate a Barcellona, non potete non fermarvi in questo gioiello!","Sono molto esigente, ma questo hotel è PERFETTO. Le stanze spaziose, luminose, dotate di tutti i comfort. La terrazza panoramica da vedere in assoluto, per ammirare la bellezza di Barcellona, quasi attraverso lo sguardo del celebre Gaudì!
La SPA non è enorme ma completa di tutto, la colazione molto varia, con una gamma di prodotti di qualità. Il prezzo pagato in questo hotel è direttamente proporzionale all'alto standard proposto da questo albergo. Lo staff è incredibilmente gentile e attento ai bisogni del cliente, hanno aggiunto alla mia lista di cose da vedere a Barcellona chicche che solo chi vive da anni a Barcellona può conoscere!
Un mix di eleganza, accuratezza, con la tipica gentilezza che contraddistingue Barcellona e le persone che ci vivono.",5,2015,10,31
40,Hotel fantástico para escapada ,"Muy bien situado, a dos pasos de Paseo de Gracia, la atención es exquisita. Solo pude estar una noche, pero suficiente para poder apreciar su nivel. De las mejores camas que he descansado en años, muchas gracias por todos los detalles ya que era mi cumpleaños.

40,Hay que descubrir los restaurantes de los Hoteles,"Aunque no nos hemos alojado en el Hotel, puesto que vivimos en Barcelona, fuimos a cenar a su restaurante a primeros de septiembre, ya que nos pareció que sería agradable poder estar al aire libre en un jardín urbano, en pleno centro de la ciudad. Así fue, no nos decepcionó. El lugar tiene mucho encanto y es tranquilo. La comida fue excelente, con unos precios bastante ajustados y un buen servicio.  Tiene la ventaja de que puedes subir a tomar la última copa a su terraza, con vistas al Paseo de Gracia y música chill-out.",5,2015,09,14
40,Exelente Oasis en Barcelona Centro_ Passeig de Gracia,"El Hotel es sobrio y elegante. Tiene una terraza y un jardín interior increible. es un espacio de paz y tranquilidad, un verdadero Oasis en pleno centro de la ciudad. La terraza, azotea tiene un fantástico bar con vistas panorámicas a la ciudad Y el mar. Todo el Hotel me parece muy bonito. Con mucho estilo.",5,2015,09,09
40,No vale lo que cobran,"Básico, mala atención. No hay puerta automática ni nadie que la abra.
Escaleras antes de la recepción y nadie que suba las escaleras. Amenities con olor horrible.
Muy bien ubicado, pileta deprimente, chica y encerrada.

No volvería ni lo recomendaría para nada.",3,2015,09,07
40,Jardin de la tranquilidad,"Jardin relajante en parte trasera. Los combinados acompañados de tapas bien cocinadas y a precio excelente. Servicio atento y eficaz, no descuidando ningún detalle. El horario de la visita sobre las 19h estuvo fuera del bullicio habitual.",5,2015,08,06
40,"Centrico, con estilo y tranquilo, un oasis en Barcelona","Alma es un hotel precioso. El diseño es minimalista y funcional, sin excesos. El servicio es impecable. La primera vez estuve unos días alrededor de año nuevo, la segunda vez en Julio. Creo que es de destacar que la mayoría del personal que recuerdo de la primera visita seguían allí en mi segunda estancia, algo que atribuyo a que se encuentran a gusto. La atmósfera del hotel es relajada e íntima. El jardín y la terraza son muy agradables y los cocktails y la comida (desayuno y alguna cena) que probé en el hotel siempre resultaron deliciosos.",5,2015,07,26
40,Un jardín tranquilo en pleno centro,"He estado este fin de semana paseando por Barcelona y con el calor decidí tomarme algo en el jardín interior que este hotel de 5 estrellas gran lujo tiene. Una delicia sentarse y no oír un solo ruido, relajarse con el fresquito de la tarde entre sus árboles y tomarse un buen zumo de fruta y verduras fresquito con un pequeño aperitivo de patatas fritas muy buenas. El servicio de alto nivel y el zumo muy bueno y echo al momento por 8 euros, aunque también se puede tomar una copa de champán, de cava de vino blanco o tinto. un coctel, una copa de generosos o de licores que van desde los 6 a los 15 euros o cafés sobre los 3 euros. También se puede cenar, en invierno hay menús por 6o euros, un poco subidos ( es un 5 estrellas) pero creo que hay más menús  y a la carta. A mi me gusto mucho.",4,2015,07,12
40,"Clase, estilo...y cerquita de todo.","En el medio del medio, Mallorca con Paseo de Gracia. Actual, elegante y bien ubicado.

40,Assolutamente consigliato!!,"... Avendo avuto un'ottima esperienza lo scorso anno ci sono ritornata anche quest'anno e devo dire che ci siamo trovati veramente bene .  Ottima posizione in una zona molto elegante della città oltre che molto centrale ,  Hotel di design molto caratteristico,  stanze spaziose e pulite e soprattutto una cortesia ed un servizio davvero notevoli .   La SPA è piccolina ma carina e la colazione può sembrare costosa... in realtà è molto varia ed offre prodotti di alta qualità. Da provare sicuramente ... Ritengo sia uno dei migliori a Barcellona...decisamente  vale il prezzo che si paga!!",4,2015,06,14
40,Barcelona y su Alma,"Hermoso Hotel con una ubicación privilegiada,a pasos de casas Gaudi y atracciones de la Bellisima Barcelona.

Me gustaría regresar a Barcelona y al Alma Hotel.Guardo una especial consideración a varias de las personas que se desempeñan en ese hotel ,uno de ellos ,oriundo de mi país .Gracias,",5,2015,06,12
40,Tocando el cielo,La ultima vez que estuve en el Hotel fué en su terraza. Realmente impresionante la vista que te ofrece de Barcelona. Disfrutas de la vista de 360º de una nueva Barcelona de noche. Sin duda para volver. El servicio amable y con una sonrisa cuando te atiende te hace sentir como y relajado. La cena el el patio de abajo es también muy recomendable por la singularidad de lo que te rodea y apoyado de nuevo por un buen servicio.,5,2015,06,11
40,Extraordinario!!!,"Después de visitar varias terrazas de hoteles de Barcelona, estuve con unos amigos en la de Alma, LA MEJOR, sin duda, es un jardín interior precioso, tranquilo, unos sillones cómodisimos y cuidado hasta el más mínimo detalle, iluminación, música , etc, Con un ambiente selecto, mucho glamour, y un servicio esmerado, aparte de copas y tapas ofrecen comidas y cenas.
Próximamente nos dijeron que abrirían  otra en la última planta, tendremos que volver, seguro que será otro paraíso para recomendar .",5,2015,06,10

40,La habitación y el servicio excelente,"Estuvimos un fin de semana en el Hotel Alma y nos encantó.  Al llegar nos ofrecieron una copita de cava y la acepté de buen gusto ya que me planteé cuál era el objetivo: pasarlo bien, entonces a por ello.  La habitación era una Junior Suite con vistas a la calle. Las dimensiones y todos los detalles del máximo nivel.
El jardin interior era muy bonito y el comedor también.
El personal muy atento",5,2015,06,05
40,UN PEDACITO DE CIELO....,"Me aloje en este hotel el fin de semana del 29 de mayo y fue una experiencia inolvidable y difícilmente mejorable.
Las habitaciones son muy espaciosas (por supuesto impolutas) y estupendamente decoradas. Las camas son como dormir en una nube. Ese día dormimos rápido y aun y todo descansamos mucho.
Las instalaciones son espectaculares, el spa y el gimnasio son un remanso de paz y recomiendo que lo use todo aquel que se aloje.
El personal muy atento y servicial y la zona donde se ubica es la mejor de Barcelona.
El restaurante y el jardín interior del hotel son una auténtica maravilla...tomé un desayuno tardío sentado en un gran sofá y fue todo un lujo. Los snacks estaban buenísimos.
Si fuera multimillonario viviría ahí....",5,2015,06,05
40,"Excelente ubicación, excelente atención!","El hotel Alma es sin duda uno de los mejores hotel boutique de Barcelona, no solo por su excelente ubicación, a media cuadra del Passeig de Gracia, sino que también por su impecable atención.

40,Gastfreundliches Alma!,"Sehr zuvorlommender Service, jederzeit hilfsbereit. Wünsche/Anliegen wurden einem sofort erfüllt.
Minibar wurden jeden Tag kostenlos wieder aufgefüllt. Zimmer sehr sauber und gepflegt. Keine Teppichfussböden was uns sehr entsprach. Busstation und U-Bahn gleich um die Ecke, wie auch viele kleine Restaurant /Bistros laden zum gemütlichen Kaffeetrinken ein. Auch Tapas sind erhältlich auch take away.",5,2015,04,30
40,Para repetir,"Hotel con encanto en el centro de Barcelona, personal muy atento: recepción y comedor. Habitación muy limpia, amenities de calidad, el único pero lo haría a los edredones de la cama, a mi me resulta incómodo.
Desayuno muy completo, muy bueno, vale la pena incluirlo en la reserva del hotel.
Al no poder cenar en alguno de los restaurantes de más renombre de la ciudad, decidimos cenar en el hotel, recomendamos el menú de degustación por 39 eur.",5,2015,04,29
40,Restaurante sorprendente,"Restaurante sorprendente en el corazón de Barcelona, estilo moderno, minimalista y acojedio, con un ambiente muy relajante, terraza exterior y un servicio exquisito. Estuvimos cenando cinco colegas y nos deantamos por el menu degustación, un gran acierto !",5,2015,04,25
40,"Servicio inmejorable, hotel con Alma","Escogimos este hotel para pasar un fin de semana tranquilos en Barcelona y no nos decepcionó: la ubicación es inmejorable, en el corazón de Barcelona, a un paso de La Pedrera, Casa Batlló y las mejores boutiques internacionales de Paseo de Gracia.
El servicio una auténtica delicia desde el aparcacoches hasta los camareros, pasando por recepción y limpieza.
Los productos que nos ofrecieron en el desayuno fueron de la más alta calidad y merece la pena cada € que pagamos.
Sin duda, un gran hotel al que estamos deseando volver.",5,2015,04,20
40,Impresionante Hotel en Paseo de Gracia,"Desde el momento que pisamos el hotel, todo fue perfecto. La ubicación es maravillosa, pero el hotel es tranquilo a pesar de estar en el centro de la ciudad.

La habitación era muy amplia, con vistas al precioso jardín del hotel (una joya para estar en pleno centro de Barcelona). El colchón era muy comodo.

El personal fue muy muy atento, nos hicieron sentir como en casa desde el primer momento. 

El desayuno es el mejor que he visto en un hotel de esta categoría. Muy muy completo. Diferentes tipos de quesos (todos buenisimos), embutidos de calidad, diferentes tipos de panes, bizcochos, bollería, variedad de zumos y frutas, yogures... y además desayuno caliente a la carta. Todo muy muy bueno.",5,2015,04,11
40,Hotel Boutique en Paseo de Gracia,"Hotel boutique, ideal para pasear por paseo de Gracia, entre la Pedrera y Casa Batllo. Cerca se encuentra la Cuina den Garriga (consell de cent), tienda gourmet para comer y degustar buenos vinos. La relacion calidad precio del hotel es excelente, y el trato del personal adecuado a la categoria. Hotel para repetir. Ideal para turismo urbano. Metro cercano.",5,2015,03,28
40,"Excelente servicio, inmejorable ubicacion","Desde nuestra llegada, todo fue perfecto. Nos hicieron sentir como en casa. Instalaciones muy modernas y muy funcionales. No tuve oportunidad de probar el restaurante, pero me lo recomendaron mucho. La zona es perfecta, cerca de tiendas, restaurantes y sitios de interes",5,2015,03,25
40,"Si, pero...","Muy buen hotel, céntrico, con un buen servicio de restaurante, aunque es un espacio que parece más una cafetería, la comida está bien presentada, es sabrosa y con buena materia prima. La habitación era espaciosa y moderna. Disponen de un jardín que en verano ha de ser espectacular. El único PERO que encontramos es que deberían avisar con antelación a los clientes que el SPA estaba fuera de servicio ya que fue uno de los factores decisorios para elegir este hotel.",3,2015,02,12
40,Ein wirkliches 5-Sternehaus,"Wir haben den Aufenthalt im Alma Barcelona sehr genossen. Für eine Wochenendreise ist das Hotel perfekt gelegen, das Restaurant sowohl für Frühstück, als auch für Abendessen sehr sehr gut und der Service ist dezent, aufmerksam und entspricht der 5-Sterne-Kategorie: wir mussten uns über nichts ärgern und alle Wünsche wurden uns von den Augen abgelesen. Das Housekeeping ist mehr als aufmerksam, ordentlich und sauber.",5,2015,02,09
40,Muy bueno,"El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, es bonito, personal muy atento. En general muy bien. La única critica que tengo es que me parece costoso el desayuno 25 euros por persona. El hotel esta rodeado de muy buenos sitios para desayunar que cuestan mucho menos. No mas a la vuelta esta un sitio fabuloso que se llama Jaime Bierestain, que es un sitio con muchas alternativas de desayunos y además es una tienda de objetos de diseño. Vale la 1/2 del hotel y es estupendo. El hotel pierde competitividad al no incluir el desayuno en la tarifa. Por lo demás muy bien",5,2015,01,19
40,Alma está ubicado estratégicamente donde vibra Barcelona,"Alma está ubicado estratégicamente donde vibra Barcelona, a un paso de la Pedrera y la Casa Batlló, finamente decorado y desde la azotea se puede apreciar la azotea de la Casa Milá y la Sagrada Familia.

40,Super Hotel,"Ich bin sehr oft geschäftlich in Barcelona und muss sagen , dass ist mit Anstand das beste was man im centrum finden kann . Easy Check In und easy Check out.
Tolle Atmosphäre, super Service und sehr tolle NEUE Zimmer.
Ich liebe dieses Hotel. Meine Freundin auch( Direkt gegenüber ein Louis Vuittton Shop)

LOL",5,2015,01,10
40,Fantástica experiencia,Nunca me he sentido tan a gusto en un hotel.  Es la mejor atención que jamás he recibido.  Tengo muchas ganas de repetir y ya he recomendado este hotel a mis contactos.  La comida también muy bien y el diseño es muy agradable.,5,2014,12,13
40,Gran 5 estrellas en el centro,"Excelente hotel de 5 estrellas en pleno centro de Barcelona, junto al Paseo de Gracia. Gran hotel de lujo con un cuidado en los detalles exquisito. El personal muy atento desde el primer momento. Las habitaciones espectaculares. Y el restaurante ¡increiblemente rico todo! Me encantó la experiencia de alojarme en el hotel. ¡Muy recomendado!",5,2014,12,12
40,2 notti con Prontohotel,"Ho trovato un ottima tariffa per una camera doppia su prontohotel.it (quasi metà prezzo) e muovendomi all'ultimo come al solito ho fatto davvero un buon affare! Ho viaggiato a Barcellona qualche settimana fa e sono rimasta molto soddisfatta di questo hotel sia per la posizione (centrale e raggiungibile tutto) e piuttosto raffinato, un buon mix tra eleganza e accuratezza e la camera accogliente.. lo consiglio davvero!",4,2014,12,09
40,Exelente ubicacion!,"Muy buen hotel, exelente servicio, ubicación estratégica, muy limpio todo y de muy buen tamaño las habitaciones, precio/calidad es l mejor opción 
Lo único fue que la regadera no tiene puerta y se sale el agua, y el buffette de desayuno es caro por lo que ofrecen , espero sirva mi opinión ",4,2014,12,06
40,Buen alojamiento,"El hotel es precioso, muy disimulado para ser un 5 estrellas lo cual me parece curioso, pero me gusta, la ubicación es perfecta en el centro de la ciudad, la calidad de la comida es pésima, es la tercera vez que me alojo en este hotel y cada vez que vuelvo es por su ubicación y precios, pero no volveré porque cada vez el nivel de comida es peor, en comparación con la oferta gastronómica que tienen en sus alrededores.

",4,2014,12,03
40,Un hotel de lujo diferente,"Visité el Alma poco después de su apertura aunque no me alojé en el. Con ocasión de nuestro aniversario mi mujer y yo decidimos pasar una noche en el hotel. Las habitaciones son amplias, confortables y acabadas con materiales de calidad, con un estilo minimalista alejado de cualquier ostentación.
El servicio, integrado por gente joven, es atento y eficiente. 
Todo el hotel respira tranquilidad, a pesar de su ubicación excepcional al lado del Paseo de Gracia.
Mención especial merece el jardín interior, que te hace sentir fuera de la ciudad. A pesar de la fecha, la agradable temperatura nos permitió cenar en el, muy bien por cierto.
En conjunto el hotel responde a las espectativas de un cinco estrellas, siempre que espere tranquilidad y discreción, algo que yo valoro positivamente.
Sin duda repetiría.",5,2014,11,25
40,Otra forma de entender un hotel de lujo,"En pleno centro de Barcelona, un ejemplo de buen gusto, diseño y calidad. El personal sin distinción de puesto implicado al máximo en atendernos como si fueran los propietarios del establecimiento. Un espacio agradable y relajante y, sobre todo, discreto.  Enhorabuena a los responsables de invertir menos en dorados, botones con librea de guardia en la puerta y entradas faraónicas, y más en calidad de materiales, cocina, diseño y amabilidad. Sin duda volveremos.",5,2014,11,12
40,Un remanso de paz,"Es un hotel que contrasta con el bullicio de la ciudad, solamente al entrar ya se percibe una paz que es de agradecer en una ciudad como Barcelona. Los colores relajantes, la suave música del hotel, y ese toque de interiorismo tan elegante me encantaron. El parquet en espiga de la habitación le da una calidez que parece que uno se encuentre en un piso del ensanche barcelonés.
Tuve la oportunidad de degustar algunos platos de la nueva carta de su restaurante y son realmente excelentes. Recomiendo las vieiras con puré de canónigos!
Me gusta muchísmo su jardín interior tan tranquilo para ponerse cómodo en los sofás y tomar algo por la tarde.
La guía de la ""otra Barcelona"" que ofrecen en la habitación también me pareció muy original.",5,2014,10,17
40,Experiencia Maravillosa,"Me alojé con mi novio en el hotel Alma y puedo asegurar que fue una experiencia maravillosa.
Nada mas entrar, la persona que nos atendió en recepción fue muy atento y amable, y nos explicó detalladamente los servicios del hotel. 
La habitación muy cómoda, sobretodo la cama. Y el cuarto de baño magnífico, con una bañera y ducha muy espaciosa.
Cenamos en el jardín ya que el tiempo acompañaba, pero debo decir que el restaurante es muy acogedor. El jardín es precioso, es increíble que existan sitios así en pleno corazón de Barcelona,
Después de una cena que debo de calificar como excelente, fuimos a la terraza, la cual tiene unas vistas increíbles de la ciudad.
El spa muy agradable, y el desayuno estupendo, muy completo y de gran calidad, 
Con muchas ganas de volver a repetir!",5,2014,10,12
40,"Descubrimiento magnífico, un hotel con Alma","Elegí este gran hotel para una escapada romántica como regalo de cumpleaños de mi mujer gracias a las opiniones de Trip Advisor y fue un gran acierto.
La localización es inmejorable. Muy céntrico y bien comunicado, pero huyendo de las grandes avenidas. Nada más entrar aprecias la tranquilidad y el estilo refinado y moderno del Alma. Te reciben amablemente con una copa de cava y te registras cómodamente. La habitación es espectacular, de gran tamaño para estar en el centro de la ciudad aún siendo una habitación estándar. Todos los detalles y materiales son de gran calidad: albornoz, zapatillas, jabones, toallas, sábanas… y la cama, increíblemente cómoda!  También ofrecen wifi gratuito en todo el hotel y el minibar incluido! En cada rincón, encuentras detalles agradables.
 No tuvimos tiempo de usar el spa ni gimnasio, pero sin duda es un buen valor añadido.
Probamos el restaurante. Tienen un jardín urbano único, donde vale la pena venir aunque sea solo a tomar un café. El desayuno es espectacular. Puedes hacer un brunch delicioso, con productos locales y de calidad. Los platos calientes son exquisitos, la ensalada de fruta así como los embutidos y quesos son para probarlos todos. 
Cuando nos alojamos tenían un bar-terraza en el ático, para degustar cócteles admirando las bellas vistas de Barcelona.
En definitiva, estancia inolvidable, con precios asequibles para un 5 estrellas G.L. en el centro de Barcelona. Trato excelente de personal muy atento y cercano. Sin duda, repetiremos y recomendaremos este gran hotel a nuestros amigos.",5,2014,10,12
40,El hotel perfecto en Barcelona,"Hace 3 días mi pareja y yo nos alojamos en el hotel Alma y des del momento que entramos ya sentimos esa esencia especial que caracteriza el hotel; la personalidad que tiene. La ubicación nos permitió salir a caminar por el centro de Barcelona viendo todas las tiendas/restaurantes más céntricos. En cuanto al servicio, el ""staff"" del Alma es súper profesional y a la vez cada persona le da su ""toque"" de personalidad, el cual agradecimos mucho.
Cenamos y desayunamos en el restaurante/jardín del Alma y fue el remate para nuestra estancia. La cena la hicimos en el jardín y fue muy agradable ya que la comida estaba buenísima y la noche acompañaba. El desayuno también  fue completísimo y perfecto para coger fuerzas para pasar el día por la ciudad.
La habitación es muy cómoda, sobretodo la cama. Descansas perfectamente y te levantas aún mejor. Nosotros nos quedamos con ganas de quedarnos más días.. pero al no poder ser, ya sabemos dónde alojarnos si vamos a Barcelona otra vez. Sin duda, un 10.",5,2014,10,08
40,La excelencia,"Entrar en el Alma Barcelona es entrar en un mundo en que la excelencia es norma. Desde que traspasas su puerta desaparece el ruido de la ciudad, estando en el centro de ella, y caminas hacía la calma.
Todo el equipo humano se mueve para que tu estancia sea perfecta, la profesionalidad convertida en natural, sin estridencias,  impecables en cada acto. Las habitaciones son tu casa, las camas, para no levantarte de ellas, el cuidado en el detalle, la exquisitez de la decoración, cada elemento está pensado para el bienestar.
Los espacios comunes invitan a prolongar la estancia, el jardín, la terraza, el espacio donde comes, sin hablar de la calidad de la restauración, desde el desayuno, hasta el sandwich del room service.
El hotel Alma es un hotel para revisitar y donde cada estancia es un lujo para el cliente. No se me ocurre un destino mejor en la ciudad de Barcelona.
Gracias por tanto !",5,2014,10,06
40,Una isla de tranquilidad,"Mi novia y yo estuvimos un día y disfrutamos mucho del hotel. Principalmente de su tranquilidad, ya que la habitación es súper silenciosa así como los pasillos de la planta. La cama tiene un excelente colchón y ropa de cama cómoda, por lo que descansamos estupendamente. Además hay 2 terrazas, a cuál más bonita: la del jardín interior, grande, con mucho verde e ideal para una larga charla o lectura y la del ático, con 2 ambientes diferenciados: uno con vistas hacia la calle Mallorca, más informal y movida y la otra, tranquila, con sofás para relajarse y con lindas vistas a la terraza de La Pedrera, de Gaudí, con sus inspiradoras formas y el trajinar de sus visitantes.
También pasamos un buen rato en el spa, con unas saunas seca y húmeda relajantes y una piscina en la que hasta nadamos unos largos.
El desayuno es espectacular por la calidad y me quedé encantado con la variedad de quesos autóctonos.
Todo en el hotel es de calidad, desde el diseño, pasando por los materiales, hasta la comida y, si hay algo que supera todo lo anterior es la atención del personal: recepcionistas, camareros, personal de plantas y encargados; a todos se los ve amables, atentos y con disposición a que pasásemos una excelente estancia.
¡¡¡Una experiencia para repetir sin duda!!!",5,2014,09,24
40,"Ubicación, Lujo, Servicios y comfort","Una experiencia inolvidable, con la mejor ubicación. Teníamos tiempo sin hospedarnos en un hotel con esta calidad de servicio por parte del personal, se nota la diferencia. Las camas, colchas ""individuales"" disponibles si así lo deseas nos permitieron dormir durante 12 horas seguidas a nuestra llegada, cosa que no hacia desde hacía como 5 años. Las habitaciones son amplias, acogedoras e impecables de limpieza. El baño y la bañera impecables y la ducha gigante hací que uno no quisiese salirse de la ducha en horas. Definitivamente sino el mejor, uno de los mejores hoteles que he visitado en mi vida. Lo único malo fue el poco tiempo que me hospedé",5,2014,09,24
40,Top Designer Hotel!!!!,"Das Hotel besticht zum ersten durch sein geniales, puristisches Design und zum zweiten durch sehr nettes Personal und spitzen Lage!
Für einen Kurztrip nach Barcelona total zu empfehlen!!!!!!!
Es wurde in vorherigen Kritiken die relative Dunkelheit im Hotel bemängelt, dem ich mich aber nicht Anschlüssen kann bzw dunkel: eher ja, störend: nein.
Ich werde sicher wiederkommen!",5,2014,09,24
40,Segunda vez que disfrutamos de alma BCN,"Cuando repites un hotel, es difícil que vuelva a ilusionarte o sorprenderte....porque ya das por hecho lo más evidente y lo mejor por lo que vuelves a elegirlo. En nuestro caso, la decoración, el servicio, la comodidad de la cama, la calma de la piscina, su situación...ya no nos impresiona...porque ya lo esperábamos...pero los pequeños detalles siguen teniendo su valor, y la terraza y su patio son ideales para descansar. Este hotel te hace sentir bien, cómodo, que pagas, porque las cosas tienen un precio, pero te aportan sensaciones...No se si volveremos, pero si lo hacemos seguro que vamos sobre seguro...",5,2014,09,15
40,ESPECTACULAR TERRAZA CON VISTAS A BARCELONA,"Una de las mejores terrazas de Bcn. No hace falta ser huesped del Hotel.
 Vistas norte, Pedrera, Sagrada familia y Tibidabo y vistas Sur al mar. Buen servicio, tranquilidad y buena relación calidad/precio. IMPERDIBLE!!

El Jardin de la planta baja también es un remanso de paz en medio de BCN",5,2014,09,12
40,Experiencia para los sentidos!!!,"Una cordial bienvenida y una copa de cava son el preámbulo de una estancia increíble!
""James Bond system"" para acceder a las habitaciones y al spa!! El sistema de escaneo de huellas es genial, no más tarjetas magnéticas, no más llaves!!!
Habitación impecable, espaciosa, agradablemente iluminada, decorada en tonos que inducen al descanso, desde mi quinto piso tenía vistas a la Pedrera de Gaudí, sin dudas pude presumir de tener una de las mejores vistas de Barcelona, sobre todo a la noche cuando la iluminan.
Todo estaba en su lugar, no faltaba nada, batas, toallones gigantes, mini bar GRATUITO, amenities exquisitos, sábanas increíblemente suaves, edredones individuales (genial para no destaparse el uno al otro) hasta el más mínimo detalle cuidado a la perfección, a tal punto que los chocolates que dejan para ""desear buenas noches"" tienen la característica forma hexagonal de los mosaicos diseñados por Gaudí que cubren las aceras del Passeig de Gràcia!!! INCREIBLE!!
El directorio precisa y explica TODOS sus servicios, no hay necesidad de llamar a Recepción para nada, bien pensado!!!
La ducha de la habitación es toda una experiencia . . . y para los amantes del aire acondicionado como yo, encontrarán óptima satisfacción!
La terraza en el séptimo piso es algo que no se pueden perder . . . las vistas son de película!! La ambientación es un 10!! Sofás, velas, mucho verde, madera rústica, buena música, exquisitos cócteles!! 
Sinceramente no dan ganas de salir del hotel, teníamos planes de cena fuera, pero decidimos quedarnos en el restaurante del ALMA, tienen (como si fuera poco) una terraza que es la continuación del restaurante y del bar seguida por un jardín!!!! 
Cena deliciosa! con entrantes frescos para esta época del año, excelente calidad de producto, cocina gourmet pero con gustito a ""casa"", entorno inmejorable, mantelería, cubertería, y para los amantes del dulce . . . coulant de chocolate con helado de vainilla . . . un placer para los sentidos!
El desayuno claramente no podía defraudar . . . el bikini Alma y el bocadillo ""Pepito"" no se pueden perder! jugo de naranja recién exprimido, ensalada de frutos rojos, embutidos y quesos locales, variedad de nutritivos panes, fruta, huevos a la carta, bocadillos de jamón y de salmón con huevas de trucha . . . calidad, calidad, calidad!!!!!!!
Spa de lujo, no le falta nada, una delicia su piscina interior! Sauna, sala de vapor, gimnasio, duchas, tumbonas para relajarse!
Atención cinco estrellas, interactuar con cada persona del ALMA es un placer, siempre cordiales, amables, dispuestos a ayudar, siempre con una sonrisa, sin duda esta buena actitud/aptitud de la gente es lo que marca la gran diferencia con otros hoteles y es lo que hace, en conjunto, que uno quiera repetir sin dudarlo, felicitaciones a todos!!!!!
Nos hemos quedado enamorados de Alma Barcelona y de su gente, sin lugar a dudas repetiremos, pero la próxima vez nos quedaremos el doble de tiempo!!!!!",5,2014,09,11
40,Una escapada perfecta,"Mi pareja y yo hemos decidido programar una mini escapada para desconectar un poco de la rutina y hemos elegido el Hotel Alma. Al entrar a su lobby principal ya se puede sentir la tranquilidad que permite huir del movimiento turístico de la ciudad, sobretodo en su precioso jardín de patio de manzana el cual es perfecto para comer, tomar algo, leer, etc.

Desde el check in hasta el check out la atención del personal del hotel es impecable. Los chicos de la recepción nos proporcionaron toda la información necesaria tanto del hotel como de la cuidad con mucha simpatía.

Las habitaciones están diseñadas para proporcionar un ambiente de descanso. Nos hemos hospedado en una habitación Grand Deluxe en la 3ra planta con vistas al Jardín perfecta para los que disfruten del silencio. La cama y el sillón de cuero son extremadamente cómodos y la distribución de la habitación es perfecta para compartir en pareja. En especial disfrutamos de los deliciosos Amenities de marca (MALIN+GOETZ) con su variedad aromas naturales. Nos ha parecido genial también que el minibar es gratuito!

El Spa es un espacio muy acogedor. Las duchas que se pueden encontrar en frente a la piscina son súper agradables ya que cuentan con varios tipos de chorros que salen en diferentes direcciones siendo posible graduar la intensidad y la temperatura del agua.

La cena en el Jardín del Alma fue muy agradable. Recibimos un servicio genial y la comida fue muy rica. Y para los amantes del desayuno como yo, el desayuno buffet del Hotel Alma es ideal. Puedes encontrar básicamente lo que te apetezca dulce o salado e incluso platos calientes.

En general nos ha encantado la estancia en el Hotel y lo recomendamos totalmente para este tipo de escapadas no tan lejos de casa.",5,2014,09,04
40,Volvería. 5 estrellas GL,"Todo siempre depende de gustos y prioridades.. El Alma Barcelona es pues según mis gustos, un 5 estrellas gran lujo compacto, con todo en su lugar, muy bien conservado, limpieza gral. muy buena, bien ubicado a 10 mts del paseo de la Gracia.. Check in rápido, personal atento, y el más de todos fue Marco, que nos ayudo muchísimo y siempre tan gentil y bien predispuesto, que hasta los niños lo querían! Área del loby pequeña, es como minimalista moderno, resto con ambiente agradable y con patio.. Los cuartos amplios, con piso de madera, muebles y accesorios impecables, los pasillos y cuartos son oscuros pintados en colores oscuros, decorados con colores bien oscuros.. Entonces es un punto a tener en cuenta en cuanto a gustos, a mi particularmente no me desagrada, wifi gratis excelente, frigobar incluido ( bebidas) la calidad de sueño muy buena, la blanquearía excelente, en una cama amplia 2 cobertores muy confortable e inusual, ventanas con vista a la calle.. Variedad de canales en la Tv...Nos dieron cuartos comunicados  para con los niños, lo que pesa mucho a la hora de hablar bien o elegir un hotel cuando viajas con niños y en familia .. Cuarto de baño amplio, tina y ducha separados lo que es esencial !! Amenities de calidad y limpieza muy buena, el desayuno era bastante sabroso, aunque España no sea muy generosa en desayunos, el Alma estaba correcto y sabroso, el concerje funciono bien... Aunque no todos con el mismo ánimo de servicio o ayuda al cliente. En fin volvería..",4,2014,09,04
40,Estancia perfecta,"Estuve una noche mientras se arreglaban los papeles para la compra de un piso en Barcelona y la estancia no pudo estar mejor. Yo no soy el típico que comenta en las redes sociales, pero la atención tanto como la gente del restaurante y terraza tan maravillosa que tengo que contar mi opinión.

La limpieza fue uno de los factores claves de nuestra satisfacción. No volveré a quedarme alojado por que ya tengo casa, pero yo ya soy un cliente asiduo del ""Jardín del Alma"" (El mejor salmorejo de Barcelona)",5,2014,08,25
40,Una experiencia inolvidable,"El hotel Alma Barcelona es sin duda un 5 GL, esto es debido por varios motivos, el primero de todos ellos su perfecta situación ya que esta en pleno centro turístico de Barcelona así como al lado de la misma artería principal para poder hacer shopping (Paseo de Gracia), el diseño y la decoración están a la ultima y el personal del hotel es en todo momento muy profesional y servicial, te hacen sentir como en casa. La habitación es muy amplia, limpia y silenciosa, el bar de la terraza es espectacular sobre todo por la noche y por lo que hace referencia a la restauración del hotel tanto la cena como el desayuno son de sobresaliente, lo que destacaría como punto negativo es que el hotel no dispone de parking propio, pero hay un parking publico al lado mismo del hotel y tienen un precio muy económico para los clientes del hotel.",5,2014,08,18
40,Fantástico! Excelente servicio.,"Un Hotel fantástico con un personal genial y unas instalaciones con mucha clase.
La ubicación del Hotel es perfecta. El restaurante con su jardín es un sitio donde merece la pena disfrutar del desayuno y de la buena cocina que ofrece el resto del día. La terraza del ático en el último piso es perfecta para tomar una copa con unas vistas únicas de la ciudad. En resumen: muy recomendable. (poder abrir las puertas con la huella dactilar es super cómodo)",5,2014,08,14
40,ESTANCIA MARAVILLOSA,"Desde el momento en el que entre sabía que había reservado el hotel perfecto para mi y para mi mujer.
La profesionalidad de todo el staff y particularmente el de recepción fue especialmente destacable. 
Tengo que decir que el desayuno me impresiono gratamente porque todos los platos calientes se hacen al momento y no se mantienen recalentados en recipientes.
El ático ofrece un ambiente relajado imposible de encontrar en la tan ajetreada Barcelona.
Me aloje en la 205 por 3 noches que es una Deluxe porque mi presupuesto no era muy elevado y a pesar de que todas las Deluxe tienen dos camas twins unidas, he de decir que eran súper cómodas. El minibar y el wifi gratuito es un valor añadido que casi ningún hotel de esta categoría ofrece.

Si pongo todos estos factores en una balanza he de decir que ha sido una estancia maravillosa. Muchas gracias Alma Barcelona. Seguir haciendo lo que quiera que estéis haciendo porque sois maravillosos",5,2014,08,13
40,Hermoso lugar para alojarse,Es un excelente lugar para pasarla bien con amigos y disfrutar de una maravillosa ciudad como Barcelona que te hace sentir como en tu casa y seguramente te dará ganas este hotel de pasar un grato momento.,4,2014,08,12
40,Moderno y bien Ubicado,"Tuvimos 2 habitaciones, ambas amplias, limpias y modernas, los baños grandes y comodos con gran calidad de productos de baño.
No hay alfombras se mantiene limpio y fresco.
El Personal muy atento y amable.
Tranquilo y con poco ruido.
El servibar gratis un plus",5,2014,08,02
40,Un aperitivo sotto le stelle....,Non ho soggiornato in questo albergo....ma sono stato sulla terrazza panoramica dello stesso a gustarmi un ottimo aperitivo guardando i tetti ed il panorama incantevole della Barcellona....tinta di Gaudi....Posto elegante. Buon servizio. Cibo e bevande....discrete.; Atmosfera Fantastica !!!!,4,2014,07,28
40,Preis/Leistungsverhältnis = sehr schlecht,"Als wir ankamen , war das Personal sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Dieser Zustand verschlechterte sich jedoch von Tag zu Tag , angefangen mit dem herum lungern vom Personal an der Rezeption, beim Roomservice das Telefon abnehmen und wieder auflegen bis hin zum nicht bedient werden im Garten Restaurant. Alles zusammen muss ich sagen , dass ich sehr unzufrieden mit dem Hotel bin. Dies war mein erster und letzter Besuch im Hotel Alma! ",1,2014,07,23
40,Toll,"Das Hotel liegt zentral, ist unaufdringlich luxuriös und das Personal äusserst hilfsbereit und nett. Die Zimmer sind grosszügig, alles funktionell und ein unerwartet schöner Innenhof in dem das ausgiebige und feine Frühstück serviert wird. Die Bar auf dem Dach mit wunderschönem Blick auf Casa Mila, die Sagrada Familia und gegen das Meer, am Abend sehr zu empfehlen. Super!",5,2014,06,29
40,Un hotel de lujo,"Hotel de lujo en el corazón de Barcelona. La verdad es que desde que cruzamos la puerta nos dimos cuenta de la calidad del hotel. Todas sus estrellas son bien merecidas y el servicio es de lo mejor de la ciudad. Durante nuestra estancia utilizamos la terraza jardín interior que tiene. Es una auténtica delicia disponer de un espacio así en el centro de Barcelona. Estábamos a un paso de la zona más chic de la ciudad, ideal para salir a cenar e ir de compras. Nos gustaron mucho los detalles. Muy amables en permitirnos dejar la habitación después de comer para coger el avión de vuelta. Cosas así hacen que el cliente repita.",4,2014,05,06
40,Espectacular,"Un diseño excelente, muy poco ostentoso y muy bien pensado. Excelente proyecto de restauración con habitaciones muy especiales. El servicio es perfecto, muy atento sin ser pesado y el desayuno buenísimo",5,2014,04,30
40,Delusione!,"cose positive: sicuramente la posizione, tra la casa pedrera e a Batlo', la dimensione della camera e il bagno,veramente spaziosi.
Cose negative: pulizia delle camera, in 3 giorni per ben 2 oltre non ci hanno rifatto la camera,quindi attesa affinche' la sistemassero e dopo una giornata di camminata non e' piacevole. Finestre bloccate e in primavera un po' di aria fresca non dispiace. Addetti alla reception non tutti disponibili..... Insomma mi aspettavo di piu' ! ",2,2014,04,27
40,el mejor desayuno *****GL,"Asistí a un desayuno de trabajo con personas que estaban alojados en este céntrico hotel.Me sorprendió el ambiente de calma y tranquilidad que se respira,el cuidado de todos los detalles,desde la elección de los servicios de mesa,tazas,manteles,etc. hasta el patio interior de manzana,típico del centro de Barcelona con un jardín espléndido.Muy cuidada  selección de quesos,charcutería,panes,mermeladas... todo de producción artesanal y de una calidad insuperable.Pequeños sandwitchs, huevos revueltos,pochés etc.preparados al momento , ""bikinis"" de mortadela trufada hasta un ""pepito"" de butifarra catalana con cebolla confitada(para mí memorable).Me sorprende que la cena no esté al mismo nivel,como manifiestan otros viajeros.Sin duda voy a volver a cenar, para disfrutar de su jardín y espero que de su cocina.",5,2014,04,12
40,unauffällig luxuriös,"Das ganze Hotel ist sehr geschmackvoll einfach gehalten. Durch diese luxuriöse Einfachheit unterlegt mit dunkeln Farben und gezielter Beleuchtung entspricht dies nicht dem konservativen, klassischen 5 Stern Hotel. Wer dicke Teppiche und verstaubtes Personal sucht findet auch in Barcelona genügend Alternativen. Wir hatten eine kleine Suite mit einem super Boxspringbett, das Schlafen war ein Gedicht, Kuschelfaktor garantiert! Das Zimmer wurde gekonnt zwischen Schlafen ( eigenen TV ) und Wohnbereich mit einem halbhohen Highboard unterteilt, so blieb der schöne Raum eine Einheit.
Aufmerksamer und professioneller Service, alles passt, ausser dass man nicht selbständig das Fenster öffnen kann (öffnen unterliegt dem Hauspersonal ) …. Wellnessbereich ist sehr klein und fein jedoch für uns nur teileweise nutzbar, Wassertiefe 90cm!  Alles sehr sauber und elegant.
Ein absolut empfehlenswertes, ideal gelegenes Stadt-Hotel unser Favorit in Barcelona.

40,Como en mi casa,"No es fácil sentirse en casa cuando se está en un hotel, en Alma Barcelona sí.
El servicio es magnífico, lujo de verdad, todos sonríen y no hay colas ni aglomeraciones en conserjeria. Ambiente es muy agradable, un oasis en el centro de la ciudad. Y además ofrecen el mejor desayuno de hotel que recuerdo.
Solo un fallo, se agradecería un vestidor o un armario más grande. Me encantaron las amenities de Bulgari.",5,2014,04,07
40,Uhmmmm,"Me aloje en un viaje de trabajo. Buscaba un hotel para luego ofrecerlo en un evento que íbamos a organizar.
El hotel es todo un descubrimiento. El personal es muy atento, las habitaciones son amplias, el buffet del desayuno perfecto... No todo es perfecto, por desgracia tardan en servir la terraza del bar y el desayuno hasta las 7 no esta preparado.
No me parecen pecados mortales. Al contrario, volveré y espero poder estar tan a gusto como ya lo estuve.",4,2014,03,26
40,non proprio perfetto,"Hotel di classe con servizio di buon livello .Gentile ma discreto il personale.Situato vicinissimo al passeig de Gracia.Devo tuttavia segnalare alcune piccole pecche considerando il livello dell'hotel:il wc e' ubicato in uno stanzino separato dalla stanza da bagno ma in tale stanzino non c'e' l'estrattore d'aria;non esiste il bidet(a quanto pare è solo nelle suite);il locale dove sono i 2 lavandini, la doccia e la vasca da bagno è molto spazioso ma si apre direttamente  sul vano di entrata perche' non c'è la porta .Ho dovuto chiedere la cuffia per la doccia e i cotton fioc che mancavano nel set dei prodotti per la toelette( mi è stato detto che andavano richiesti poiche' l' hotel è minimalista......)Il mini bar è gratuito e fornisce acqua minerale e succhi di frutta.Concordo con chi dice che non guasterebbe un bollitore per caffe' e te'.Ottima la qualita' del sonno : la stanza è ben insonorizzata.Eccessivo il costo della prima colazione, dato ilprezzo della camera potrebbe essere inclusa una continentale.Comunque nell'insieme il giudizio non è negativo",4,2014,03,19
40,Irregular,"Sorprende que el hotel disponga de un buen nivel culinario en los desayunos, y las cenas sean de la calidad de una pension de tercera. 
He acompañado a clientes alojados en el Hotel, que han venido a Barcelona con motivo del MWC, teniendo varias reuniones a la hora del desayuno, siendo realmente agradabla tanto la comida como el ambiente. Por dicho motivo decidi, repetir a la hora de la cena del lunes. La experiencia fue penosa, retraso en el servicio,  mala calidad en los productos, una presentacion penosa de los platos. El comentario fue general y coincidente entre los comensales, con todos aquellos con los que hable y que estaban alojados en el hotel ninguno ha repetido a la hora de cenar el resto de la semana.",3,2014,03,01
40,tutto bene ...o quasi,"Arriviamo in  Hotel e  veniamo accolti veramente in modo ottimo. Check in seduti e tanta cordialita'...ci viene offerto da bere , tutto perfetto. La struttura e' molto bella, sia negli spazi comuni che nelle camere. Anche la piccola spa e' molto bella ma, nota dolente,  acqua della piscina era fredda. Cosi dopo aver indossato il costume niente bagno....si torna in camera delusi. Abbiamo cenato al ristorante per ben due sere...tutto delizioso. Camerieri gentilissimi ed ottimo cibo.Altra nota dolente nel bagno nessun set vanity , che spesso risultano molto utili...solo bagnoschiuma e shampoo in quantità ridotte.Concludendo : da apprezzare l attenzione al cliente da parte del personale e la bellezza  della struttura , da lamentarsi di quei servizi che ci si aspetta da un hotel 5 stelle lusso e che invece mancano e deludono!!!",4,2014,02,18
40,A falta de casa....Alma!!!,"En Alma sabes desde que llegas que no eres un número mas en la lista de huéspedes, ellos te harán sentir como que eres el único!. Al llegar me constipé y en todo momento estuvieron pendientes de mi. La decoración minimalista realza la pulcritud, orden y señoría de sus espacios. Desde la agilidad en todo lo que concierne a recepción, administración, información hasta en el mantenimiento de las áreas impecables y el servicio de restaurant, permiten planificar tu tiempo y actividades fácilmente. Los desayunos son tan ricos como nutritivos en una atmósfera de paz con música para relajarse e iniciar un excelente día. El servicio de lavandería disponible todos los días te saca de apuros. El menú del restaurant es exquisíto y bien servido. Y, si todo esto no es suficiente, está ubicado en un punto super estratégico para quienes quieren hacer turismo, shoping o, por el contrario, para quienes necesitan trasladarse en cualquier medio de transporte (bus, metro, taxis) o caminar. Ahora, quienes prefieren descansar, disfrutarán de una hermosa terraza barcelonesa, así como de un rico espacio de fitnnes y spa. Cuando vuelva a Barcelona se que, a falta de casa... tengo Alma. Lo recomiendo",5,2014,02,17
40,Muy buen hotel,Un hotel muy bien situado y con muy buenos servicios. Un bar muy bonito y las habitaciones amplias y limpias. El personal muy amable y comprometido con la empresa. Merece la pena volver. Lo recomendaré.,4,2014,02,07
40,Excelente hotel.. nos encantó!!,"Pasamos unos días inolvidables en este hotel. El personal muy cortés y agradable, que te hacían sentir como en casa!. Los desayunos una maravilla!!! La habitación preciosa y super acojedora!! Muy limpio todo!! Todo un descubrimiento!! Tiene todo lo que se puede pedir a un hotel excepcional|| Volveremos muy pronto y por supuesto lo recomendamos 100%. Un éxito de estancia.",5,2014,01,02
40,Perfecto,"Buen clima y ambiente, perfectamente situado, buen trato no me quejo en nada!!
Zona agradables y muy tranquilas , habitaciones impecables con fácil acceso y muy muy buen mini bar!!
Perfecto lo recomiendo",4,2014,01,01
40,Estupenda ubicación,"Nos ha encantado, el trato y la limpieza han sido excelente. El servicio muy amable y siempre disponibles. Nos ha gustado la decoración, la habitación era muy cómoda y la tranquilidad en el hotel y las habitaciones nos invitaba a relajarnos tras los dias de paseos por la ciudad, excelentes vistas desde la terraza. Los desayunos no se los pierdan Volveremos.",5,2013,11,28
40,Grande classe,"Eccellente hotel , di classe, ottimo servizio, personale gentile e discreto, sanno trattare in modo adeguato la clientela, cosa non troppo frequente in Spagna. Ottimo rapporto prezzo/qualità. A 10 mt dal passeig de gracia adiacente alla Pedrera. Non resterete delusi, consigliatissimo!  
Solo un suggerimento, in camera manca uno specchio di cortesia per il trucco, le ragazze desiderano controllare il look prima di uscire.",4,2013,11,24
40,IL POSTO GIUSTO,"Abbiamo pernottato in questo hotel per 5 notti.
Le cose che abbiamo apprezzato di più:
Check-in e Check-out al tavolo con bevanda offerta,e non al solito bancone in piedi.
Personale giovane e dinamico.
Suite (nr.101) ampia, ca.50 mq, arredamento minimale/essenziale ma confortevole.
Letto grande e comodo. se invece del piumino ci fosse stata anche una coperta più leggera sarebbe stato perfetto.
Bagno fantastico. WC e BIDET posizionati in uno stanzino separato da una porta dalla zona lavandini, doccia, enorme
e vasca. 
Apertura della porta con impronta digitale,comoda soluzione, non si deve sempre cercare la chiave.
La posizione è perfetta. Tra Casa Batllo e La Pedrera, 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata della metro e del bus turistico.
Le cose che potrebbero migliorare:
Il ripristino dei prodotti da bagno. Nonostante alcuni mancassero dal giorno precedente, e nonostante il riordino serale,
ho dovuto chiederli.
La televisione:in camera ce ne sono 2 ma nonostante ampia scelta di canali neanche uno in lingua italiana. A noi personalmente non interessa guardare la televisione ma mi sembra un sinonimo di disattenzione verso la clientela
italiana, sempre numerosa. 
Il minibar è incluso nella tariffa, ma se ci fosse anche un bollitore per tè e caffè  sarebbe perfetto.
L'illuminazione delle parti comuni è suggestiva  ma  scarsa.
Le suite si affacciano tutte sulla strada principale e non essendo perfettamente insonorizzzate si sente il rumore del traffico,
Per fortuna di notte è scarso. 
Presso della colazione eccessivamente elevato.Almeno la colazione continentale,visto i prezzi della suite, dovrebbe essere
inclusa. 
Comunque, nel complesso, la considero un'esperienza positiva.",4,2013,11,07
40,Strepitoso,La struttura molto centrale e qualcosa di magnifico ben arredato molto pulito e molto simpatici come tutta la Spagna . Personale molto cordiale e corretto sembra tutto fatto ad hoc. Se passate da bercellona non dimenticatevi questo posto.,5,2013,10,31
40,No lo recomiendo...,"un 5 estrellas no solo es decoración, también se requiere comodidad y cierta generosidad a cambio de un precio elevado. quien haya decorado este hotel debe ser  aficionado  ciertos decorados de película como Alien o Blade Runner o si no padece de fotofobia, es la única explicación que le encuentro a una iluminación lúgubre en todo el hotel. Los artículos de acogida en la habitación se limitan al mínimo, no hay ni gorro de ducha, peine, kit de pasta de dientes,maquinilla de afeitar etc. Los asientos en la sala de desayunos están a poco mas de 40 cm del suelo y la oferta de genero es escasa de manera que te sirves una ración de embutidos queda algo menos para otra persona. No hay carta a la vista,  como para dar el mensaje de¨ ¡No me pidas mas ! ¨ Pero te cobran 25 € por persona. No lo recomiendo",2,2013,10,26
40,Perfetto,"Nulla è lasciato al caso, un 5 stellle GL ad un prezzo straordinario, lo staff è gentilissimo e soprattutto molto molto disponibile. Le stanze pulitissime, nuovissime e con un'illuminazione molto particolare che renderà il vostro soggiorno ancor più affascinante, i corridoi silenziosi e profumati sono molto accoglienti. L'interno dell'hotel è meraviglioso. non vedo l'ora di ritornarci",4,2013,10,08

40,Un maravilloso lugar para tu escapada a Barcelona,"Decoración exquisita, servicio impecable y ubicación perfecta, definen al hotel Alma Barceloa, sin duda, uno de los mejores de la ciudad. Nuestra experiencia ha sido perfecta. Magnífico diseño y decoración en todos los rincones del hotel. Austero y elegante. La atención del personal es buenísima; todos amables, simpáticos y abiertos a darte un servicio de excelencia. Una ubicación perfecta en la calle Mallorca, esquina al Paseo de Gracia, ideal para compras y paseos. Muy recomendable",5,2013,10,01
40,location perfetta e atmosfera molto gradevole,l'albergo si trova in una zona molto centrale con ottimi ristoranti e locali vicini dove mangiare deliziose tapas. Le stanze sono arredate molto bene in stile moderno con gusto! setti ultracomodi e silenzio....vi è un delizioso dove far colazione e aperitivo nella bella stagione.nota aggiuntiva potete scegliere se aprire la porta della vostra stanza con la chiave o con l'impronta del vostro dito !!!....sicuri non la perderete!,5,2013,09,23
40,Stylish in Barcelona,"Sehr schick ist das Alma Barcelona, doch ohne aufgesetzt zu wirken - und passt so sehr gut in die Stadt. Im Hochparterre muendet eine grosszuegige, geschmackvoll ausgestattete Halle mit Bar und Restaurant in einen ueberraschend grossen Garten, ein kleines Idyll in der Stadt. Das Restaurant bietet ein kleines aber feines Angebot an Gerichten, das auch von ""Locals"" genutzt wird - Essen im Hotel ist also sehr wohl eine Alternative. Auf dem Dach eine nur abends geoeffnete tolle Terrasse mit Bar (leider ohne Speiseangebot) und spektakulaerem Rundblick ueber die Stadt - der ideale Platz fuer einen Aperitif. Die Zimmer sind großzuegig, auch dank der teilweise ""offenen"" Baeder und vermitteln Modernitaet und Behaglichkeit. Im Souterrain gibt es ein kleines Spa mit Sauna und Dampfbad sowie einem kleinem Pool und einem Fitnessraum - gerade fuer Kinder ein Paradies. Das Personal ist nett und hilfsbereit. Will man etwas kritisieren, koennte man bemaekeln, dass beim Zimmerfruehstueck fuer immerhin EUR 25,00 pro Person die Teller fehlen, was ein ""Fruehstueck im Bett"" etwas schwierig macht. Oder dass die Drinks auf der Dachterrassenbar vielleicht nicht ganz perfekt waren. Gleichwohl ist das Alma eine sehr gute Empfehlung - wir kommen sicher wieder!",4,2013,09,23
40,Oase im Stadttrubel,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, unmittelbar am Passeig da Gracia. Sehr modern, puristisch, aber etwas dunkel. Lobby, Dachterrasse und Garten laden zum Verweilen ein. Das ""Badezimmer"" ist Teil des Zimmers, zum Schlafteil hin abgetrennt mit einem Paravent. Sehr freundliches, hilfsbereites Personal. Das Frühstück ist schön präsentiert, mit EUR 25.- p.P. aber doch sehr teuer. Alles in allem ein empfehlenswertes Haus an sehr zentraler Lage.",5,2013,09,03
40,Para escapada romántica,"Nos gustó muchísimo a mi mujer y a mi, para un capricho de vez en cuando está muy bien. Bien ubicado, limpio y tenía de todo, claro que todo se paga, jeje. Lo recomendamos, un hotel diferente y original.",4,2013,08,20
40,molto buono ma da migliorare,"L'albergo in stile moderno, molto curato e bello, ottima posizione per visitare la città, personale molto professionale, gentile e disponibile 
c'era un ragazzo alla reception che ci ha consigliato un posto per mangiare le tapas, dove siamo poi andati ed erano veramente buone, le camere dovrebbero essere migliorate, nn sono proprio da 5 stelle, piumone troppo pesante per il clima di barcellona....il bagno scomodo...chiuso in un sgabuzzino...mentre la doccia molto spaziosa e comoda.",4,2013,08,03
40,Un Hotel diferente!,"Increíblemente particular, el personal está altamente preparado con una atención personalizada pocas veces vista. Reconociéndote a partir del segundo contacto, como si hubieras estado siempre alojado. Como contraste a la recepción muy amigable, cruzando las puertas del ascensor, la privacidad es tan absoluta que parece que estuvieras en tu propio apto. Es, el concepto en hoteles, moderno y acogedor a la vez, no dan ganas de salir de la habitación.",5,2013,07,18
40,La clase hecha hotel,"Llegar a las 9 de la mañana y tener la habitacion preparada es sinonimo de que la estancia va a ser increible. Tras un largo viaje en tren, fui acogido en el Alma. Es un hotel de corte moderna, que sabe coger lo especial del estilo y plasmarlo en un hotel. La atencion al cliente es soberbia, todo el mundo sabia como me llamaba! Increible.

El restaurante es realmente sorprendente, con una oferta gastronomica muy trabajada y unos precios competitivos. Cabe decir que los camareros son unos autenticos profesionales.

Pero sin duda alguna lo mejor es el jardín, es el lugar perfecto en el que desconectar del ritmo de la ciudad y descansar despues de la jornada de trabajo o de descubrir la ciudad.

Volvere sin ningun tipo de duda",5,2013,07,16
40,Barcelona Wochenendtrip,"Die Einrichtung des Hotels ist schick, man muss aber auf etwas puristische Optik stehen... Schnörkel sucht man hier vergebens ... Einziges Manko das gesamte Hotel ist sehr gedämmt beleuchtet, um nicht zu sagen sehr dunkel. Der Fitnessbereich ist mit einem 10 m Becken ausgestattet, zum Schwimmen zu wenig - in Kombination mit der Sauna zur Abkühlung allerdings perfekt. Im Innenhof zu frühstücken ist ein Highligth - allerdings sind 25 Euro pro Person unverhältnismäßig hoch, hier gibt es im Umfeld ausreichend nette Lokale ... Die Matratzen sind Top und das Personal super freundlich. Mein persönliches Highligth ist die Dachterrase - 2 Bars , ein toller Blick über die Stadt und auf das Gaudi - Museum mit cooler Musik, wird leider bei der Begrüßung nicht erwähnt. In unmittelbarer Nähe liegt Casa Mila und die Passeig de Gracia mit vielen Shops und Luxuslabels. Empfehlenswert ist die  Rambla de Catalunya bis zum Hafen zu laufen, ein Besuch der Festung auf dem Berg mit Nutzung der Seilbahn und natürlich sollte man 3 Stunden für das Picasso Museum einplanen. Wir waren aufgrund des Wetters am Strand Barceloneta , sehr voll, sehr viel zu sehen :-) , coole Bars am Strand und abends sind mehrere Clubs mit guten DJ vorhanden... Apropos Wetter, ca. 100 m entfernt vom Hotel liegt die örtliche Häagn Dazs Filiale Mmm lecker",5,2013,07,07
40,Nos encanto !!!,"El hotel tiene ALMA, la atencion es genial !!!
La ubicacion es muy buena y las habitaciones super confortables.
Unica contra: nos toco una habitacion con muchas cucarachas, espro que lo hayan solucionado.",5,2013,06,22
40,può migliorare,"sono stata all'Alma hotel per 5 giorni . camere ampie , silenziose , pulite. i prodotti del bagno buoni ma da un 5 stelle gl mi aspetto molto di più in varietà , davano solo shampoo, doccia schiuma e hair conditioner, niente creme o altri prodotti per l'estetica , cose che ti aspetti da un 5 stelle di lusso. molto scomodo il fatto che i bagni non abbiano la porta così come la doccia sia tutta aperta. Le vasche da bagno non hanno il telfono-doccia e considerata la mancanza di bidet il tutto risulta scomodo . Nonostante il lusso non ci sono particolari comforts come l'idromassaggio nè in doccia nè in vasca. La colazione è scarsa e troppo cara.La spa è deludente. buono il livello del ristorante ma poco accattivante. bello lo spazio fuori come la terrazza. ottima la posizione.centrale  ma silenzioso.",3,2013,06,20
40,No es un 5 estrellas ni mirando al cielo,"Vamos por partes: si fuera un 4 estrellas lo calificaria de excelente. Siendo un Gran Lujo 5 estrellas, me parece le falta bastante para merecerlas.
Lo mejor en general, el servicio: todos han sido muy atentos, simpaticos, profesionales. Seria lo normal, pero como no siempre lo es en otros hoteles, lo destaco.
La habitacion es grande, pero con bastantes fallos: para comenzar, el sistema de abrir la puerta, con lector de huella, no funciona: tuve que grabar 3 veces 3 dedos diferentes y ni aún asi abre: prefieran la llave. La cama de matrionio, con 2 edredones, es la cosa mas ridicula que he visto en mi vida: estamos en España y aqui eso no se usa!!. El water esta separado y lejos de lavabo, bañera y ducha, poco comodo. Mesa de trabajo muy pequeña y sin cajones. Todo muy moderno, ""clean"", pero poco ""friendly"".
Y lo peor , el desayuno. Mal servido, tazones sucios, con restos de cereales del uso anterior, poca variedad y muy caro: Prefieran hacerlo en la calle.
Claro, la localización es realmente excepcional, si eres turista, como por cierto lo eran todos los clientes que vi durante mi estancia.
Ah! Y la famosa terraza con vistas 360º de Barcelona, cerrada por reformas....",4,2013,06,13
40,Sensacional,"Remanso de paz en pleno centro de BCN. Gran descubrimiento. Recomiendo terraza muy agradable para tomar algo o incluso comer. 
Precio ajustado (para ser un hotel 5* GL) lugar muy bonito y trato atento.",4,2013,06,13
40,Sitio a descubrir,"Gran descubrimiento, es un hotel que cuando pasas por delante, ni te enteras ya que el letrero es muy discreto, en su interior encontraréis un espacio cálido y muy acogedor. Hoy he tenido la suerte de ir a comer y he salido encantado, la calidad de los productos y la elaboración de los platos están al mismo nivel que el magnífico patio interior que tienen, todo trasmite una gran armonía, es una gran sitio para ir a comer tranquilo y disfrutar de la comida rodeado de gran tranquilidad estando en el centro de barcelona. Es un lugar que os recomiendo mucho descubrir.",4,2013,06,04
40,No regreso,"Lo unico bueno que tiene el hotel es la ubicacion, el servicio no es de gran cosa, hay poco personal que atiende un publico exgente para la calidad de como lo muestran, varios enpleados tienen varias tareas.el sistema electrico de la hab es un vompleto desastre , hay que prender todo o apagar todo de un mismo boton, el closet es tan pequeno que no cabe nada. La hab. La limpian a medias, la ducha del baño de bota el agua cuando tomas una ducha de agua. No hay gavetas para guardar nada en la hab. El desayuno es costoso y malo, poca variedad. Por €5 dedayunos excelente a dos calles de ahi. Pague $400 por la noche y ni siquiera la cama es comoda, dormi muy mal, las almohadas paracen hojas de papel, amaneci con dolor de cuello, el cubrecamas individual en una cama king size, eso no tiene explicacion. Gracias por du mal servicio y atencion. ",1,2013,05,31
40,Un hogar perfecto en Barcelona,"Alma tiene todo lo que se le puede pedir a un hotel excepcional: lujo funcional, tranquilidad, servicio, comodidad y buena ubicación.

40,Spartanische Zimmer,"Design der Zimmer (Bewertung eines Executive-Zimmers zur Straße): nüchterne, spartanische Einrichtung ohne jeden Wohlfühlfaktor (im Gegensatz zur sehr wohnlich gestalteten Lobby und den Zimmern, die im Internet zu sehen sind). Fenster nicht zu öffnen. Bad/Sanitäreinrichtungen eine Katastrophe.  Ca. 1 Meter langer, schmaler Waschtisch hinter einer Trennwand anstatt eines Bades, WC ohne Handwaschbecken, keinerlei Ablagemöglichkeit im ""Bad"". Restaurantservice überfordert.",3,2013,05,13
40,UN 10 EN ATENCION,"No puedo decir más que cosas positivas de este hotel; realmente la atención recibida desde nuestra llegada al hotel por parte del personal de recepción ha sido extraordinaria, haciéndonos sentir como en casa. La decoración del vestíbulo del hotel es preciosa. A destacar que los desayunos se sirven en este mismo espacio, lo que hace mucho más agradable el desayuno.
Las habitaciones muy bonitas también y espaciosas.",5,2013,05,08
40,excelente,"Acabo de pasar un fin de semana en el AlmaBarcelona, y sólo puedo decir que ha sido una estancia perfecta. Es un hotel precioso, decorado con un gusto exquisito (me llamo la atención la iluminación, el juego de luces y sombras está muy conseguido). El personal es atento y muy profesional. En el hotel reina un clima de tranquilidad y relajación único, cada detalle está pensado para la comodidad y el disfrute de sus clientes, con una atención personalizada que hace de tu estancia una experiencia muy placentera. Destacaría que siendo un hotel de lujo es al mismo tiempo muy discreto, sin ostentaciones innecesarias pero con una calidad fantástica en todos sus servicios. El único ""pero"" es que da mucha pena cuando te tienes que ir...",5,2013,04,22
40,El lujo de la tranquilidad,"Nos hospedamos recientemente en este hotel.
Todo perfecto desde nuestra llegada hasta nuestra salida.
Remarcar el buen trato del Personal, da gusto sentirse como en casa.
Muy a tener en cuenta es su tranquilidad, si buscas relax, lo encontrarás.
Volveremos",5,2013,03,28
40,Relajación...,"Sólo puedo decir, para criticar algo en negativo, que en la calle donde se sitúa el Hotel falta espacio para aparcar.
Todo lo demás es excelente, y he estado en muchos Hoteles como para poder valorarlo con tan buena nota.
Destacar la calidad del servicio, tanto la buena, amable y cordial atención de los recepcionistas, así como el servicio de cafetería. Estuve tomando un té buenísimo en la terraza con estufas que me acogían mientras disfrutaba de la relajada tarde. Sobretodo relajada! Disfruté de un espacio de paz en la zona SPA, bien acondicionada, dónde pongo mucho énfasis en el silencio que se respiraba. Y el servicio de masajes! Hay variedad y calidad. Masajes de diferentes estilos con el nombre del mismo Hotel. Todo muy creativo y personalizado. 
Me fui con la sensación de haber invertido mi tiempo y dinero en algo en lo que repetiré sin ninguna duda. 
Así vale la pena viajar!",5,2013,03,26
40,LUJO DISCRETO,"El título ya lo dice todo, es un hotel de Lujo, pero donde el verdadero LUJO está en la discreción que reina en el hotel, nada ostentoso, y en el silencio que hay habitualmente en todo el recinto.
Es la tercera vez que lo visito y, realmente, esas son las cualidades primordiales por las que lo escojo.
Las habitaciones son muy amplias y muy luminosas, y dan a un patio arbolado que es un oasis de silencio y relajación a cualquier hora del día.
La decoración es sobria, minimalista; nada de dorados y de grandes arañas de luces. Materiales de primerísima calidad en todos los detalles, tanto de las zonas comunes como de las habitaciones (camas, sábanas, toallas, una ducha tipo lluvia espectacular), pero, una vez más con discreción, casi ""sin que se note"".
La ubicación es única. Céntrico hasta no poder más, pero a la vez ""alejado"" del bullicio y constante tráfico de Paseo de Gracia y Ramblas, tan ruidosos y masificados ambos.
Por último quiero hacer una reseña especial al personal del Hotel, todos muy jóvenes, pero con un trato, amabilidad y nivel de preparación extraordinario, de los mejores que he visto en mi larga vida de viajero en hoteles.
Un hotel absolutamente recomendable por todo lo citado, y también por la relación calidad-precio.",5,2013,03,19
40,seguro que aciertas,"1.- como aspectos positivos se puede destacar que es céntrico, grandes espacios, terraza exterior, muchos detalles de diseño arquitectónico de muy buen gusto, habitaciones amplias, sillón con puff en habitación de gran acierto, televisión grande, como dios manda, ducha grande y practica, sistema dactilar de entrada la habitación muy cómodo, servicio amable y correcto

2.- como aspectos a mejorar, la falta de garaje, ni de lugar donde parar el coche,,para sacar las maletas. servicio escaso para hotel de esta categoría, desayuno pobre, personal con escasos conocimientos de castellano( da la sensación que los españoles no somos bien recibidos,,)",4,2013,03,12
40,schönes Hotel etwas dunkel,"Die Lage des Hotels ist optimal am  Paseo de Gracia und ist trotzdem sehr ruhig.
Das Personal war sehr freundlich und das Frühstück + kostenfreie Minibar eine runde Sache.
Der Standart der Zimmer ist ok - die spanische oberflächliche Bauweise ist aber zu sehen. Auch liegen keine Sanikits (pads etc.) im Zimmer und an Shampoo und Handtüchern wird eher gespart. Das ist aber schon alles was man negatives sagen kann.

Insgesamt haben wir uns sehr wohl gefühlt.",4,2013,03,11
40,Bello,"Confortevole è bello, questo hotel ci ha entusiasmato, centrale è caro, vale la pena per chi vuole visitare Barcellona, elegante, pulita e silenziosa la camera che ci hanno assegnato, con un bagno accogliente. Lo consiglio.",5,2013,02,18
40,Acertamos,"Buena elección, todo lo que habíamos leído por internet estaba en lo cierto. La verda que la calidad-precio es inmejorable. La verdad es que nos encanto el lugar y la ubicación. Para descansar perfectamente y poder pasar unos días en Barcelona",4,2013,02,04
40,De las mejores relaciones calidad-precio en un 5*,"Hemos estado dos noches en el hotel durante un fin de semana. 
La localización del hotel es perfecta, en la calle Mallorca esquina con Paseo de Gracia, se puede ir andando a cualquier sitio. Hemos ido a cenar, de compras, pasear, etc, sin necesidad de coger un taxi.
La decoración del hotel es bastante sobria, moderna, pero sin excentricidades, cuenta con un SPA con acceso gratuito, cuenta con sauna, gimnasio y baño turco. La piscina es pequeña pero más que suficiente, la temperatura del agua perfecta.
La habitación bastante amplia, las vistas a un patio en obras no eran una maravilla, sin embargo no se escuchaba un ruido por la noche.
El baño cuenta con el WC por separado, muy cómodo ya que queda libre la ducha.
La ducha estilo lluvia, amplísima, también hay bañera.
Lavabo con doble seno, muy cómodo.
El colchón perfecto, ni duro ni blando.
La televisión bien, aunque he echado en falta canales de Digital+.
En cuanto al personal, ESPECTACULAR, todos muy amables.
Recomiendo este hotel para personas que quieran disfrutar de Barcelona en un buen hotel de 5*.",5,2013,01,27
40,Hotel molto bello,"Ho soggiornato recentemente in questo hotel e sono molto soddisfatta. é in una posizione ideale letteralmente a due passi dal paseo de Gracia quindi comodissimo per visitare le case di Gaudì e per lo shopping, il personale è stato veramente molo gentile, c'era una ragazza alla reception che vorrei ringraziare anche se non ricordo il nome perché si è adoperata affinché il nostro soggiorno fosse perfetto, gentilissima, come tutto il personale. La camera che ho scelto era una categoria superiore quindi molto ampia e pulitissima, aveva però qualche piccolo difetto: per me i cuscini erano scomodi come anche il piumone che era troppo pesante per il clima di Barcellona, era poco illuminata per leggere vicino al letto, e non c'erano canali italiani alla tv. Una cosa che ho apprezzato è di essere molto discreto e silenzioso nonostante si trovi nel cuore della città. Sicuramente se dovessi tornare a Barcellona soggiornerei ancora in questo bell' hotel e lo consiglio.",4,2013,01,11
40,Fantástico!,"El hotel tiene una decoración muy bonita, moderna, las habitaciones son grandes. La limpieza impecable y el personal muy aseado, buena presencia, muy educado y culto. Localización es perfecta.
Falta un un menú un poco mejor y con mas opciones de comidas y por el precio se podría incluir un desayuno aunque fuese sencillo.
Fue una sorpresa encontrar un hotel con tanta calidad ya que en Europa tuvimos experiencias muy malas de hoteles muy caros pero viejos y mal cuidados.
Nos encantó y volveremos.",4,2012,12,10
40,Lo que había leido se cumplió,"La atención del personal es más que exquisita (y se agradece). El desayuno está bien, pero su horario es lo mejor (hasta las 11am). La localización es perfecta: en la mejor parte del Paseo de Gracia, pero lejos del ruido.",4,2012,12,10
40,Lo que esperaba,"Trato amable y servicial en todo momento y ubicación privilegiada. No me sorprendió, porque el precio lo merecía. Buena experiencia. Mi habitación espaciosa y confortable. A mis hijos también les gustó mucho la suya.",4,2012,11,28
40,De Vuelta!,"En unos dias vamos a Barcelona, y sin duda volveremos a alojarnos en el hotel Alma Barcelona. Si La ciudad es una maravilla, el mejor lugar para alojarse es este Hotel, una maravilla a la altura de la ciudad. Un Hotel de autentico lujo, el lujo sereno, discreto y elegante que realmente enamora. 
Un verdadero placer!",5,2012,11,22
40,espectacular,"inmejorable ubicacion, personal muy atentos, edificio precioso y se puede comer en el suelo de lo limpio que esta, el desayuno esta genial y las habitaciones son escandalosamente amplias,
nos encanto, sobre todo la amabiliodad del personal del hotel",5,2012,11,04
40,One of the best in BCN,"Das Alma liegt zentral quasi auf der Paseo de Gracia und ist ein durch und durch gestyltes Hotel mit perfekt geschulter Rezeption. Die Zimmer sind sehr hübsch und so ist das ganze Hotel. Pool gibt es keinen, oder doch einen klitzekleinen im Keller neben dem kleinen Fitnessraum. Aber dafür kommt man nicht hierher. Wer hier absteigt will Barcelona erleben und dabei gediegen Wohnen. Für Sonne Strand und Pool ist man sicher im Arts oder W besser aufgehoben. Preis und Leistung passt. Einziger kleiner Kritikpunkt wäre mehr Service Personal beim Frühstück, da fehlt oft ein bißchen der Drive.",4,2012,09,25
40,"Buen hotel, desayuno muy flojo","Buen hotel, atención impecable en la recepción, siempre con una sonrisa, cosa de agradecer, ubicación excelente, junto al Paseo de Gracia, buena insonorización de las habitaciones, baño espacioso, armarios grandes, mini bar gratuito bebidas no alcoholicas, decoración un poco lúgubre, pero para gustos colores.

Desayuno buffet corto en comparación con otros hoteles de similar nivel. Falta de servicio en la reposición de los platos, calidad de la comida excelente.

Spa testimonial, buen vestuario, hammam y sauna de adecuado tamaño, pero el gimnasio pequeño y con muy poco material, y la piscina poco profunda, estrecha y larga, yo al nadar tocaba con los brazos el suelo.",4,2012,08,18
40,El mejor hotel de Barcelona,"Exquisito hotel, elegante y perfecto en todo: recepción, habitación, decoración, restaurante. No se puede esperar más. Tiene ,además, la gran ventaja de la discreción, sin olvidar la mejor situación de Barcelona",5,2012,08,12
40,Muy agradable,"Nuestra llegada fue un tanto extraña,pues el taxista no conocia el establecimiento y ni siquiera al estar frente a la puerta uno queda del todo cerciorado de que sea un hotel.
Pese a la ruidosa calle en la que se encuentra,el hotel es muy tranquilo y sobretodo muy moderno. Un detalle: se accede al cuarto a traves de la huella dactilar.
En el front desk tuvieron mucha paciencia con nuestras continuas reservas  y cancelaciones de restorants. Excelente Taperia Catalana junto al hotel.
Pese a su juventud el personal esta muy bien entrenado,especialmente Norman y Savi,quienes se encargaron de nosotros en todo momento con una atencion excelente.
Puntos negativos son la falta de gimnasio y la falta de personal en el desayuno. La TV fallaba en numerosas ocasiones.
Si no se busca un lujo extremo, es una buena opcion a un buen precio.",4,2012,08,01
40,Un hotel excelente en el centro.,"Hemos descubierto este hotel después de dudar mucho entre otros y la verdad es que fue todo un acierto.
El trato fue siempre fabuloso. Tuvimos un pequeño problema con la tarjeta del parking y lo resolvieron rápidamente y sin poner ningún tipo de pegas. Por otra parte, la limpieza de la habitación era excelente. Estuvimos en una suite ejecutiva y quizá el único pero a hacerle sea que el aire acondicionado era un poco ruidoso. Por lo demás, el baño es magnífico y la cama invita a no levantarse.
También aprovechamos para cenar en el restaurante las noches que estuvimos. La comida es realmente buena y ofrecen una gran variedad de productos de la zona que son realmente buenos. Se puede comer por un precio más que razonable para ser un 5*.
Deben mejorar algunos detalles como la rapidez del servicio y temperatura de los platos, en alguna ocasión la comida estaba ligeramente fria.
Por lo demás, la zona es realmente buena. Está en pleno centro. Ideal para visitar la ciudad.
Sin duda, un hotel excelente. Una muy buena elección.
Volveremos.",5,2012,07,27
40,Fabuloso!!,"nos cambiamos a este hotel después de una mala experiencia en otro hotel de Barcelona. Y el cambio fue par mejor al 100%. Hemos descubierto este hotel y nos ha encantado. Trato fabuloso, habitaciones excelentes, servicio de habitaciones un 10 tanto en limpieza como en educación. Los recepcionistas fabulosos,sobretodo la chica que nos atendió por la noche cuando le explicamos lo sucedido en ese otro hotel. Lo recomiendo a todos.",5,2012,07,23
40,Excepcional!,"Su ubicacion es perfecta. La atencion muy buena. Tiene una decoracion, minimalista, de muy buen gusto. El lobby, el bar, el restaurant, la terraza, el spa, todos espacios que te hacen sentir bien. Me encanto que hubiera flores naturales en las habitaciones. Las toallas del baño, las batas, las pantunflas y la ropa de cama de excelente calidad. Verdaderamente es un hotel de 5 estrellas. Ojala cuiden siempre su buena calidad. Mi estancia en Alma Barcelona fue excepcional! Lo recomiendo demasiado!",5,2012,07,16
40,Durmiendo entre nubes,"Arropado por los majestuosos edificios de Gaudi, se siente uno más en la bellisima Barcelona, desde el momento que cruzas las puertas y llegan las sonrisas sientes que has llegado a casa. 
Elegancia, sencillez y calidez, despues del cansacio de un vuelo eterno desde europa, todo lo que puedes desear, una refrescante bebida, una agradable acogida y una habitacion con una cama que invita al descanso mas profundo.
Un precioso Spa, un patio que invita a la lectura y al olvido del mundo exterior, un silencio ambiental dulce y exquisito, una sensacion de sentirte cuidado pero en casa en todo momeno
en definitiva un regalo para los sentidos, sin duda volvere a alojarme en el Alma Barcelona o deberia decir el hotel de mi Alma.",5,2012,07,08
40,Modernidad y Confort ...,"El Alma Barcelona es un hotel moderno y confortable, con servicio 5 estrellas, trato amable y servicial en todo momento y ubicación privilegiada. 

Ubicación: a solo media cuadra del Paseo de Gracia, justo detrás de la La Pedrera de Gaudi … excelente ubicación, en pleno centro distinguido de Barcelona, rodeado de las mejores tiendas, a solo unos pasos de la estación de metro Diagonal y Paseo de Gracia … frente a La Pedrera, a solo una cuadra de Casa Batlo … Paseando por Rambla Cataluña o Paseo de Gracia se llega hasta el Gotico, la Catedral , el Born y Barceloneta … todo en medio de un paseo encantador … 

Hotel: el hotel es un hotel moderno, sobrio y con un lujo minimalista. Veniamos del Alma Sevilla donde aparte de estos adjetivos esta el encanto de estar en un antiguo Palacio que le dio un plus que en Barcelona no encontramos … pero fuera de esto … el Hotel esta muy bien.  Sobriedad moderna en todo su lobby y sus áreas comunes, un patio moderno y un restaurante muy bueno. Un Spa en el -1 con sauna y baño turco muy relax. 

wifi de alta velocidad en todo el hotel.

Habitacion: moderna y confortable, con decoración de diseño, excelente cama para un descanso reparador, buenos edredones con sabanas de algodón de muy buena calidad … toallas de excelente calidad … Limpieza impecable. Tamaño amplio y comodo, con un gran LCD.  Lo mejor: VISTAS directas a la azotea de La Pedrera … durante las noches de verano hay jazz en la azotea y solo abriendo los ventanales de la habitación podemos estar ahí mismo, pero mejor! Lo peor: tanta modernidad de diseño en el baño con una puerta vidriada en la ducha … de dudoso gusto … auqnue moderno.

Es un hotel 5 estrellas de alto precio, que no se compara a su hermano sevillano … para eso le falta encanto …",4,2012,07,07
40,DISCRETA ELEGANCIA EN BARCELONA,"Si algo cabe destacar del hotel es lo confortable y comodo que es en todos los sentidos. Mención aparte  merece su bonita y esmerada decoración en la que los detalles cobran gran importancia. Personal amable y colaborador. Desayuno muy agradable en un jardin diferente. Hotel con personalidad, a nosotros nos encanto.",4,2012,06,15
40,Service ausbaufähig,"Die Lage des Hotels ist ideal, die Einrichtung geschmackvoll, die Zimmer grosszuegig,  die Ablagefläche für Kleidung etwas dürftig, die Zimmer zur Strasse sind nichts für lärmempfindliche Ohren, Badezimmer (Juniorsuite) sehr geräumig;
Service des Empfangs freundlich und kompetent,
Frühstück für den Preis inakzeptabel: geringes Angebot (Butter nur auf Nachfrage), unfreundlicher Service,
Spabereich klein, Schwimmbecken zum Schwimmen bei Wassertiefe von 1 m nur für Kinder geeignet,
Trotz dieser Mängel empfehlenswert!",4,2012,06,11
40,Muy buen Hotel,"La calidad humana del hotel es sobresaliente, ademas de sus instalaciones nuevas y modernas que son muy buenas. Recomiendo quedarse en el Alma si vas a Barcelona.",5,2012,06,11
40,albergo piacevole,"ero stata in un albergo della stessa compagnia a berlino e mi era piaciuto molto e anche l Alma se non allo stesso livello, merita di essere consigliato.Le cose positive:la posizione innanzitutto, girato l angolo ci si trova su paseig de gracia, la camera (io ho preso una categoria superiore)era molto grande con la boiserie grigia e molto silenziosa, in bagno i prodotti Bulgari.Anche la hall e, ben disegnata e si affaccia su un grazioso giardino , avrei scelto pero per la zona bar/colazione delle poltroncine piu particolari meno da ufficio visto che il tutto e gia molto semplice se pur ricercato e quindi un tocco  di ""esagerato"" non ci sarebbe stato male.Le note negative sono :la colazione un po triste e il fatto che nonostante si fossero dati da fare a cercarle, l albergo non dispone di coperte normali e cosi a maggio in spagna ho dovuto dormire sotto al piumino come sulle alpi austriache e quindi costretta ad accendere l aria condizionata cosa che eviterei di fare  anche in piena estate",4,2012,05,28
40,Un hallazgo ...,"Es la segunda vez que vengo al Alma Barcelona, definitivamente es mi Hotel en esta ciudad. 
Me suelo fijar mucho en los detalles y desde luego aquí todo está pensado ...
Inmejorable la limpieza tanto en Habitaciones cómo en el resto del hotel.
Amabilidad es la norma de la casa.
He pasado todo el tiempo que he podido en el maravilloso Jardín, desayuno, te por la tarde, lectura ...
Cuando podré volver?",5,2012,05,12
40,Super Lage und Design,"Im Zentrum von Barcelona, in ruhiger Lage und mit einem hervorragendes Design. Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter sind freundlich, professionell und kompetent. 
Nachteil: Breakfast war 55€, dafür gab es nicht wirklich viel und es hat an Auswahl gefehlt.
Trotzdem gerne wieder.",5,2012,05,11
40,un lugar excepcional en barcelona,"El Hotel es discreto, elegante y muy tranquilo. Se respira amabilidad por parte del servicio y la atención es muy cuidada. Tanto la habitación como las estancias comunes son muy agradables. Volvería sin dudarlo",5,2012,05,08
40,Sencillamente increible,"Llamé a las 3 de la madrugada para avisar de nuestra llegada sobre las 4. Mauricio estuvo increible, gestionando el checkin casi por teléfono. Llegamos y solo tuve que firmar y coger la llave (Mauricio nos ahorró tener que hacer el proceso de escaneado de huella con el que se abre la puerta de forma habitual). La habitación sobresaliente. Una Grand Deluxe. Cama a la altura de las mejores, diseño, iuminación, amenities, todo de 9 o más. Por la mañana, más que recomendable desayunar con vistas al patio interior. Debora nos sirvio un exquisito buffet en la mesa donde no faltó de nada. El hotel tuve el detalle de ofrecernos complimentary late checkout teniendo en cuenta la hora de nuestro checkin. Gracias a Guillermo y a todo su equipo por las apenas 10h increibles que pasamos en su establecimiento. Sin duda repetiremos y recomendaremos.",5,2012,05,07
40,El mejor hotel que que he visitado,"Creía que después de tantos viajes y hoteles no me iban a sorprender. Después de estar este fin de semana en el hotel Alma Barcelona he de decir que lo han conseguido. Por concepto de hotel, amabilidad, comodidades, atención, limpieza...
Realmente suelo ser muy exigente cuando viajo a hoteles de 5 estrellas, y este desde luego es otra dimensión.
Desde el desayuno (fantástico) a la posibilidad de tomar una copa en total calma y tranquilidad en el patio interior. El ambiente es perfecto tanto para ir en familia (como fue mi caso) o en pareja o en viaje de negocios. No podría catalogar el tipo de viaje ideal para este hotel porque creo que todos serían posibles e igualmente placenteros.",5,2012,05,02
40,Ottima posizione buon hotel,"Posizionato praticamente sulla strada principale di barcellona. Camera molto ampia (executive) e ben organizzata. Ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo.
Solo due pecche, una veniale, tv con 70 canali, neanche 1 italiano e poi la colazione, assolutamente non al livelloper un hotel di questo tipo e per il costo, 25€ a persona. Cmq ci tornerei sicuramente.",4,2012,05,01
40,"Suuper Lage, sehr schoenes Hotel","Hotel ist super gelegen, aber denoch sehr ruhig. Alles sehr modern und die Zimmer sind sauber. Bar im Hotel ist leider meistens leer. Zimmerservice ist richtig schlecht. Breakfast war 55€, dafür gabs ein kleines Tablar mit nicht wirklich viel darauf. Service im Hotel ist auch nicht Top. Haben etwas im Hotel vergessen, um uns das zu schicken wollen Sie die KK haben um uns das zu verrechnen, das ist nicht der gewohnte Service eines 5-Sterne Hauses. Insgesamt schönes Hotel, aber Service stimmt noch nicht.",4,2012,04,18
40,La sencillez de los pequeños detalles le hace grande,"Barcelona, como elegir entre tanto hotel? Esa era nuestra misión. Y tras elegir previamente dos y gracias a vuestras opiniones, decidimos probar en alma hotel. Combina a la perfección la rehabilitación de un edificio con clase y respeta lo mejor en sus techos altos, las carpinterías, su fachada...con una decoración minimalista, moderna y con gusto. La combinación de colores neutro, la piel y la madera hacen q las estancias denotan armonía. No puedo dejar de mencionar la limpieza, de impresión...Lo certifica. También la sonrisa y calidez de Sus trabajadores. Sabia lo q significa un 5 estrellas pero este hotel sus 5 estrellas no está en lo q le diferencia de 4, sino en muchas cosas simples, q la mayoría de los hoteles no cuidan. Es un regalo y lo pagamos con mucho gusto, porque nos ha regalado una gran experiencia.",5,2012,04,09
40,"Un hotel con gran clase, situado en el centro del centro, y sumamente tranquilo","* Me encantó la estancia en Alma Barcelona.
* Destaco el excelente servicio y el permanente interés de los empleados por resolver hasta el mínimo detalle que les planteas.
* Es un hotel de lujo tranquilo, nada ostentoso. El lujo está en los materiales, el servicio y la tranquilidad.
* Desayunar en el jardín interior es una delicia difícil de describir.",5,2012,03,26
40,Uno de los mejores Hoteles que he estado,"La amabilidad del personal, la atención y el ambiente son intachables, la limpieza de la habitación y la insonorización son de 10 sobre 10, lo dicho uno de los mejores hoteles que he estado, nos volveremos a ver pronto.",5,2012,03,19
40,Elegancia,"Pocas veces coincide en un hotel la elegancia y la facilidad de trato, el lugar es un pequeño oasis en medio de la cidad, habitaciones amplias y bien cuidadas, y la cama de extrahordinaria comodidad. Lugar dificil de encontrar. Buscarlo es un regalito en esta ciudad.",5,2012,03,15
40,Remanso de paz en medio del bullicio de la ciudad,"Después de pasear por el centro de la ciudad, con todo el bullicio de la gente realizando las compras de Navidad, entrar en el hotel Alma te produce increible sensación de paz y sosiego.

La comida sabrosa, mezclada con gracia y sabor.",4,2012,01,31
40,Comida buena de verdad,"Este mediodía hemos almorzado en el Restaurante del Hotel Alma de Barcelona  en un ambiente relajado y servicio inmejorable, y si el marco es de 5 estrellas gran lujo, tal y como se acredita el establecimiento, la comida ha sido para despertar todos los sentidos. Felicidades al joven y ya reconocido chef Sergio Humada y al cocinero cordobés Jorge que nos ha ofrecido tan exquisitos manjares. Me gustaría ser crítico gastronómico para poder explicaros  como eran cada uno de esos platos pero desde mi sencillez os digo que sirven comida ""buena de verdad"", no dejéis de visitarlos, os sorprenderán.

40,PERFECCION,"Sin duda , Barcelona es una gran ciudad, y un hotel como Alma Barcelona no hace sino aumentar su encanto. Un ubicación perfecta, un Lujo autentico, tranquilo, sin estridencias de mal gusto. Un personal sinceramente atento, con la maxima discreción. Magnifico restaurante , y magnifico jardin, un puro oasis en el centro de la ciudad. Lujo con mayusculas. Sencillamente, un placer.....",5,2011,12,09
40,Eine Oase der Ruhe mitten im Zentrum,"Hervorragendes Design und noch bessere Matrazenqualität. Ein kontemplatives Hotel mitten im Zentrum, nur weniger Schritte von der Haupteinkaufsstrasse weg. Enorm freundliche Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter. Ein Hotel für Personen, die lieber Sein als Schein, lieber echte (wenige) Materialien als viel ChiChi bevorzugen. Riesige Dusche. Vielleicht lässt sich noch etwas machen mit den Aufhängevorrichtungen für die Frottéwäsche und mit dem Schreibtisch ;-).",5,2011,12,07
40,Fin de semana con Alma .,"Tres días de relax en pleno centro de Barcelona , cuidado hasta el mínimo detalle , todo el Alma hace que te sientas bien , su magnifico personal , su cuidado diseño y su inigualable ubicación hace que elegir el Alma en tu viaje a Barcelona sea una buena opción .Su estupendo desayuno invita a programar el día relajadamente.

40,"EXCELENTE HOTEL, SUPERO EXPECTATIVAS.","Nos ha encantado el hotel. Viajamos mucho y nos gusta encontrar un hotel ubicado y con diseño. Es sofisticado y lujoso pero con un toque de funcionalidad. Las habitaciones son impresionantes y muy amplias, descansamos muy bien porque no hay ningun tipo de ruido, lo que se agradece bastante.El baño es estupendo y los amenities de lujo. Tiene una excelente ubicacion, immejorable. Lo mejor de todo fue el increible trato tan calido y amable de parte del staff, sobre todo por la ayuda y esmero que recibimos de todos asi como las excelentes sugerencias en cuanto a lugares y restaurantes. Muchas gracias Javi y Mikel, de Barcelona lo que nos llevamos fue una gran experiencia, sera nuestro hotel favorito por mucho tiempo. El desayuno amplio y variado. Tiene un jardin lindisimo que vale muchisimo la pena.Supero por mucho las expectativas que teniamos. Regresamos al hotel Alma de seguro en nuestro próximo viaje a Barcelona.",5,2011,11,28
40,Espléndido sin ser opulento,"El trato es excelente, con gente joven, amable, dispuesta y al mismo tiempo discreta. Es un hotel de 5 estrellas en una edificación típica del Ensanche barcelonés, perfectamente restaurada, por eso la entrada al hotel, que se corresponde con el portal de la antigua vivienda, es sencilla y nada ostentosa, pero distinguida. El ambiente es relajado y tranquilo. Las habitaciones (Executive Suite) son muy amplias con un diseño elegante; poseen dos estancias separadas por un mueble bajo. Únicamente destacaría como negativo, la ausencia de sofá en la zona de estar, en vez de las múltiples butacas.",5,2011,11,28
40,QUIERO PERO NO PUEDO,"Casi no se percibe la entrada del hotel (un pequeño cartel con el nombre)

Muchos estilos distintos de decoración. Habitaciones amplias pero con falta de calidez

Quizas porque es un hotel nuevo aun no tiene un toque personal.",3,2011,11,15
40,aspettative soddisfatte,"l'albergo è in una posizione perfetta per lo shopping e la visita delle case di Gaudì. Buona qualità del servizio (anche il fatto di trovare il proprio quotidiano preferito al mattino al breakfast è molto piacevole) e nell'insieme ci si sente a casa. Le camere sono silenziose, belle e spaziose ma purtroppo poco illuminate la sera (manca una lampada da un lato del letto per cui se si è in due si fatica a leggere con la piccola luce a muro). La prima colazione non mi ha entusiasmato e neppure il fatto che ci siano canali televisivi in tutte le lingue compreso cinese e giapponese, ma neppure uno in italiano, comunque è un albergo che attualmente consiglio",5,2011,11,02
40,Sofisticado y agradable,"Deberían tener mas utilities en el servicio del baño , por el resto el hotel es una maravilla.",5,2011,10,26
40,"Unauffälliges, charaktervolles Hotel","Das ALMA Hotel ist ein sehr zurückhaltendes Hotel in der Carrer de Mallorca. Füßläufig ist der Placa de Catalunya in weniger als 10 Minuten zu erreichen. Auf dem anliegendem Passeig de Gracia findet man die namenhaften Designer der Welt, die zum Einkaufen einladen.
Die Fassade des Hotels sowie der Innenbereich sind renoviert. Der Eingang ist sehr dezent gehalten. Einzig die kleinen Buchstaben des Hotelnamens weisen darauf hin, dass sich hinter dieser Fassade ein Hotel befindet. Nichtsdestotrotz kommt einem sofort der Page entgegen, wenn das Taxi vor der Tür hält, um das Gepäck in Empfang zu nehmen, die Tür zu öffnen und einem zum Check-in zu geleiten. Der Eingangsbereich sowie die Rezeption sind sehr modern und stilvoll. Der Check-in findet im sitzen statt. Sofern die beiden Ledercoachen besetzt sind, wir man eine Treppe und in den Vorraum der Bar geleitet und es werden wahlweise Champagner oder Wasser zur Begrüßung angeboten.
Der Check-in geht sehr schnell und höflich von statten. Anstelle eines Zimmerschlüssels wird ein Fingerabdruck genommen. Das ist sehr schön, da man eine Plastikkarte weniger im Portemonnaie hat. Noch bevor man auf das Zimmer geleitet wird, erkundigt sich die Dame an der Rezeption, ob weitere Wünsche bezüglich einer Reservierung in einem Restaurant in der Stadt oder im Hotel bestehen oder ob man sich eine Sehenswürdigkeit ansehen möchte, damit der Weg geplant werden kann. Ungeachtet dessen, erhält man sofort einen Stadtplan. Auf diesen wird das Hotel sowie die Sehenswürdigkeiten markiert.
Auf dem Zimmer angelangt, wird man mit den technischen Geräten vertraut gemacht. Das Zimmer an sich ist eine Mischung aus modernen und klassischen Möbeln. Die Zusammenstellung passt perfekt. Es gibt ausreichend Steckdosen, so dass man alle technischen Geräte parallel aufladen kann. Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und die Badeutensilien von hoher Qualität. Die Minibar ist inklusive und wird täglich gefüllt. Auch der Turndown-service funktioniert tadellos. Die Zimmer sind sehr ruhig.
Überdies verfügt das Hotel über einen schönen Innenhof, auf dem man die Mittagsstunden verbringen sowie den Abend stilvoll einläuten kann.
Im Ganzen ist das Hotel in einem seht guten Zustand. Etwas, was man nicht sehr häufig in Barcelona findet. Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und äußerst freundlich, ohne in irgendeiner Form aufdringlich zu sein.
Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis stimmt. In diesem Hotel werden wir hoffentlich nicht das letzte Mal gewesen sein.",5,2011,10,09

40,Individuelles Hotel,"Das Hotel Alma ist ein sehr neues Hotel, so dass unser Taxifahrer trotz Adresse Probleme hatte, es zu finden. Dann aber hat mich das Hotel vom Check-In an überzeugt. Da gerade alle Mitarbeiter beschäftigt waren, wurden wir gebeten in der Lobby Platz zu nehmen und haben einen Begrüßungsdrink bekommen. Recht schnell wurden wir dann zum Check-In abgeholt. Etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig ist es, dass man das Zimmer mit Fingerabdruck öffnet, dazu muss man beim Check-In den Abdruck einlesen lassen - es hat aber prima funktioniert. 

Das gesamte Hotel wirkt modern und individuell. Unser Zimmer auf einer der höheren Etagen ging zur Straße und war eher schlicht und in dunklen Tönen eingerichtet, aber sehr modern. Das Bett war hervorragend und wir haben darin sehr gut geschlafen. 

Besonders positiv hervorzuheben ist das Personal, das wirklich sehr nett und hilfsbereit ist, das toll renovierte Gebäude, kostenlose Minibar mit Wasser, Soft Drinks und Säften, kostenfreies W-LAN und die Lage: Man ist in einer Querstraße des Passeig de Gracia und in wenigen Minuten zu Fuß am Placa Catalunya.",5,2011,10,08
40,Decepcionada,"Ya cuando reservé me pareció un poco caro, pero teniendo en cuenta que mi reserva era de una habitación grand de luxe y un hotel de cinco estrellas G.L., situado en el lugar apropiado para mi, lo reservé. Cuando llegamos allí, la atención fué estupenda y nos asignaron una habitación que daba al jardin en la sexta planta. Al día siguiente me llama por teléfono una persona del hotel explicandome que había un problema en las tuberías del baño y que nos cambiaban a una habitación igual pero en la segunda planta. La habitación estaba bien, pero eso de la planta no me entusiasmó. Normalmente en hoteles de esta categoría te asignan una habitación superior, cuando el problema es de ellos. Yo creo que todavía les falta rodaje. Solamente se disculpó una persona por las molestias, la que nos ayudó a cambiar el equipaje. No creo que vuelva.",3,2011,09,19
40,acerbo,"sono stata in qto hotel leggendo le recensioni ma devo dire ke ne sono rimasta poco soddisfatta.
L hotel è in una zona molto comoda e avrebbe tutte le caratteristiche per poter essere un buon hotel 5* ma hanno voluto aprire troppo presto e quindi:la spa non  è attiva,il ristorante in terrazza non è attivo, la palestra non c è,i canali italiani non ci sono(nemmeno 1),in camera non c è nemmeno il classico elenco dei servizi e dei numeri dell hotel,il kit d bellezza(basilare in un 5*).
Tutto qto sarebbe accettabile dato lo sconto sul prezzo ke fanno al momento,però sul sito dell hotel credo dovrebbero specificare qte momentanee mancanze.
Per il resto concordo ke il personale sia ultra disponibile e professionale e credo tra 1 annetto potra essere un hotel piacevole soprattutto x chi piace lo stile minimal ultra moderno",3,2011,09,19
40,Excelente en su totalidad,"Este hotel es, en mi opinión, la mejor opción para aquellos que quieran disfrutar de la ciudad Barcelona alojándose en un hotel de categoría superior.
Se hace difícil empezar, ya que todo resulta destacable, pero si hay algo por lo que lo destaca este este hotel por encima de todo es por la extraordinaria amabilidad y profesionalidad de todo el personal. Desde mi llegada hicieron todo lo posible para que la estancia fuera tan maravillosa como lo fue. 

En cuanto al hotel, la ubicación es inmejorable, está situado junto al Paseo de Gracia a dos minutos de la Pedrera y casa Batlló, lo que te permite desplazarte a pie a muchos lugares y también hay paradas de autobús y metro muy próximas.

La decoración del hotel es absolutamente impactante, vanguardista y con una magnífica iluminación. Los espacios comunes son muy cómodos y el patio interior es muy agradable y hermoso.

Las habitaciones son amplias, muy luminosas y silenciosas. La cama es extremadamente cómoda y el cuarto de baño es precioso. El servicio de limpieza es impecable. El hotel ofrece servicio wifi gratuito así como mini-bar gratuito.",5,2011,09,17
40,Excelente hotel de estilo vanguardista y ubicacion inmejorable,"De reciente inaguracion, destinado a convertirse en una de las referencias en hoteles de lujo de BCN. Decoracion sencilla y vanguardista con muebles de diseño y sin pretensiones. Personal joven y atencion profesional. Recomendable el desayuno. Inmejorable ubicacion, a escasos metros de las principales tiendas premium del Paseo de Gracia.
Excelente relacion calidad/precio!",5,2011,09,04
40,"Meraviglioso, spero di ricapitare in un hotel di questa catena!","Nulla è lasciato al caso, un 5 stellle GL ad un prezzo straordinario, lo staff è gentilissimo e soprattutto molto molto disponibile. Le stanze pulitissime, nuovissime e con un'illuminazione molto particolare che renderà il vostro soggiorno ancor più affascinante, i corridoi silenziosi e profumati sono molto accoglienti. L'interno dell'hotel è meraviglioso, i contenuti high tech (schermo piatto da 32 pollici e lettura delle impronte digitali al posto delle chiavi) vengono affiancati dall'aspetto antico e caratteristico della parte alta dell'androne. Andateci e non vi pentirete, vivrete Barcellona ancor meglio di quanto fareste normalmente.",5,2011,08,29
40,Diseño de Lujo/ Lujo de Diseño,"Tras una discreta entrada burguesa nos encontramos con un elegante y lujoso establecimiento, quizás el mejor hotel de los recientemente abiertos en Barcelona.
Acceso de alta tecnología, espaciosas habitaciones, decoración minimalista de extraordinaria calidad (el precioso sillón de piel es comodísimo).
La cama, sobresaliente, así como la enorme “cabina” de ducha.
Aparte cabe destacar la calidad del personal, muy amable y muy atento, sin duda a la altura de las cinco verdaderas estrellas del hotel.
Suponemos que cuando el hotel esté del todo operativo podrán mejorarse algunas prestaciones, como el servicio del room-service, escaso en variedad y presentación.
No pudimos comprobar el desayuno pero lo dejamos para la(s) próxima(s) veces, porque repetiremos sin duda alguna.",5,2011,08,16
40,bellissimo hotel,"sono stata una settimana all'alma hotel insieme al mio fidanzato .
l'albergo, aperto circa dieci gg fa,è davvero bello. la nostra stanza era  molto  spaziosa ed accogliente  con un bagno  enorme e una doccia fantastica.
il personale è super disponibile,abbiamo avuto dei problemi con la connessione internet e ci hanno aiutato prontamente.
tutto pulitissimo e impeccabile. lo consiglio vivamente a tutti",5,2011,06,06
